176057722,"Under a tree, I remain buried; helpless, Unable to speak, my body laying cold to the ground. No tombstone was set for me. People were too upset At my disability and decided to murder me With their thoughts and eventually with sharp-edged swords. I was served as a side dish. I didn’t say a word. I studied in a university and then came home With the thousands of words pointed at me like sharp knives Wanting to butcher my soul for media’s side dishes. And so my family decided to prepare a coffin for me to lay in Arranged flowers and set it upon my feet and asked me to die; So I refused. I refused against their orders and they pushed me out Into the public. I didn’t want to die in their words and in their sharp tongues Trying to murder every single sprout of my soul that was sprouting out. So I knelt in front of them, and begged: “Please don’t take my life. I have a disability, but my life is nothing different than yours. Please spare me.” But the media started blasting their ideas onto the 
screen As an effort to prepare me for their next side dish. Thousands of people stood against me And my family watched me from their window, smiling at their daughter’s ultimatum. I looked at the sky and it was clear as _NAME_ and bright as the Heavens which was opening its doors. People began to watch my death as if they were watching a chicken fight And the chicken was breaking its bones and people started to laugh. Willows began to shed their leaves and birds started to cry. Strong wind blew across the buildings and in the aisles and in the marketplace. The dogs wailed as they watched in disbelief. But that’s okay; sometimes the bull is chased for better meat Before it dies before the people that it loved. I speak nothing else beneath this earth, I will begin to be one with the nature soon. But this tree, which will begin to grow on this earth, Will speak nothing more than of the thousands of those who were killed as side dishes."

They put people in my life to make america feel safe so that they dont worry or stress out about the truth that I be saying. No one wants to hear the truth about what’s going on. The government is covering alot of stuff up. They are keeping people asleep so that they dont see what’s really going on. They place friends and people in my life to keep me looking like they want which is normal so that I dont make other people uneasy. They dont like the truth that’s why they are punishing me.

I mean I have tried many occasions to just eat normal and the addiction cravings still persist. Anyways my food story is long I won’t go into it all now, I just want to say that I understand how overpowering the craving sensations can be and I understand how recovery is not a smooth journey but I believe it is possible and also gets easier in some important way.

176057832,"I really want to talk about my voices, because I don’t have people IRL to talk to them about right now. I’ve only had voices for the last 5 years. During my first few years with voices, they were mean and bullied me a lot. There were positive voices sometimes but they were rare. Over the years this has been changing, with the mean voice coming out less and less often and the positive voice staying. It was down to about one or two mean voice incidents per week. Then after getting on the medicine dosages I’m still on now (it’s been about 4 months since I changed anything) the mean voice became even less common. After moving, it’s been even better. Now I’m not saying positive voices are a good thing, I’d much rather have no voices at all, but they don’t sting or drive you crazy the way the mean voices do… the ones that attack you. This last month I haven’t dealt with a mean voice at all. I am not around an angry person anymore like I was in VA, I’m in a nice supportive environmen
t. I think that helps. I still wish the voices would all stop, and they are kind of random for thirty minutes before falling asleep, but I’m not actively being bullied anymore by them… at least for the time being. This somehow feels like a natural thing that should happen in recovery. I don’t suppose anybody else has much experience with something like this? From what I read on the forums most people’s voices are negative. The images I see also have changed, they used to be negative images and hound me almost every time I smoked a cigarette in the garage, but I haven’t been battered like that for over a month. It’s just pleasant images now and they don’t repeat themselves, they just pop in once in awhile. Most of the distress I feel these days due to the disease is from the negatives. I really hope this trend continues."

Is hospitalization necessary in certain cases? Yes. But I also think there needs to be a higher burden of requirements for admission than what we have now. For example, every time myself or another patient challenged the 3-day rule, we got extended out indefinitely. It very much seemed like retaliation for bucking back and saying we don’t need to be hospitalized. All this despite the “patient care advocate” who was there to present the illusion of a fair system.

176057848,"_AT_MENTION_ , Girl, you remind me so much of the way I used to be. Only I used to think everyone hated me, and treated me hatefully, and spoke to me, and thought about me hatefully. That was, until I got on a proper psychiatric medication regimen. Now, I’m all ok. You need to speak to a psychiatrist about everything you just told us, _AT_MENTION_ . In detail. And get on the proper medication regimen for yourself. You will feel much better when you do. God bless you."

If not, I’d have mediaid and would be very limited. I can see good doctors. Regardless, the waits suck. There seems to be a shortage of psychiatrists. The psychologists charge the same as psychiatrists but the visits are 45 min instead of 15 min and they are more accessible. The psychiatrists are paid like $250k a year or something and are more prestigious and can give meds, while the same can’t be said for psychologists. Some psychologists can do iq tests and personality tests and usually more talk therapy. I even thought about seeing a psychiatric nurse instead of a psychiatrist, but I won’t. I need a real doctor and I have limitations on how I can get Vraylar. Need extra documentation and stuff. Not worth the risk. I’ve been through so much ???? as a schizo, I don’t need extra or new diagnosis from someone with less training."

They come at me so fast or I turn around and they r in my face… -i hate when they do that!! … I see dead people. I see people I don’t know but it’s scarier when I see people I do know that aren’t really there. I’ve invited them in and had conversations and the whole thing was a hallucination. I’ll see myself completely covered in black or in blood (I know it sounds cliche but its real – well to me lol )… I’ll see a clean kitchen and look away and look back and it hasn’t been touched since the last meal. When I put on clothes I’ll look down and it’s completely different than what I saw i put on. I see cats all the time everywhere. I f

I never get use to it and I’ve have schizo my whole life… I also hear alot of voices and screaming alot that I can’t see and alot of the ppl I see can interact with me physically so I apparently also have tactile hallucinations too… just saying so yea you are not alone.

I was not growing boobs on that medicine but the akathisia is probably the worse feeling I’ve ever felt in my life other than pain of course. Just a step below pain, I had to take three other meds to not feel like my brain was being starved of oxygen"
176057867,I escaped from the Psyche Ward on a smoke break…took a taxi to Parliament Hill in Canada. I approached these police officers with my hands in my pockets…to give them gifts for our Prime Minister…for the women and children of the world. I’m lucky it was a veteran Police Officer i approached…a rookie Cop may have pulled out his gun and shot me!
176057868,I take that for akathisia sometimes. It’s pretty good for lowering blood pressure and anxiety.

Don’t think other people are judging you unless you have actual evidence etc. And be very mindful of possible triggers. That said generally I trust myself. But there are plenty of times where I kind of mentally highlight something that doesn’t feel right, and ask my friends about what their perspective on it was rather than jump to my own conclusions."

I dont want to blame things…i just want people to know AP might cause withdrawal symptoms, as i know from my own experiences, what fellow patients and psychiatrists told me and scientific literature (see article) this is something to be a bit careful about. Im not telling anyone to get off meds. I also am not saying i had no issues before meds (i had very bad anxiety), or i would surely not have gotten psychotic, or all psych problems are withdrawal related, or i definitely can get off meds (i said my team says i might, but i doubt that). I just say AP sometimes cause withdrawal issues in some people, so cold turkeying off meds thinking they arent addictive is a pretty bad idea, which is a scientific fact."

Now I think I hold my breath for ten minutes at a go normally, before I smoke again, and even then I don’t inhale right down to the bottom of my lungs or even much into my lungs at all, just my throat. I believe I must be breathing with my skin.

Me and your grandmother took some of the brown acid at Woodstock and fell in love in the medical tent. I saw 15 Grateful Dead Concerts. We saw _NAME_ flash the crowd in one of the Doors’ last concert. I saw _NAME_ burn his guitar. I went to so many Metallica concerts in the 1980’s that I needed hearing aids at age 17. I cheered on our troops after the First Gulf War by waving the flag at the parade. This weed’s the best. I streaked across Yankees’ stadium in 1975. I was a Rolling Stones’ groupie.

176057920,I’m sorry you are feeling so overwhelmed. You are going through so much right now. Remember these things are temporary and sunny days are ahead of you. Try to hold on to hope of a better tomorrow. I don’t know your location to give you the number to the suicide hotline but you can google it and there is always the emergency room and your pdoc might have an emergency number you can call. There’s no shame in asking for help when you get this low. You don’t have to suffer alone. I hope you feel better. I’ll be holding good thoughts for you. .
174356675,"I had two breakdowns this summer with delusions and mania like symptoms and hospitalization. I have been lethargic since then (4 months) but now it seems slowly to go better with the energy. I was helped by increasing my dose of Mirtazapine (AD) without consulting my pdoc, besides that im on abilify, tried amisulpride but it made me drowsy. May the energy be with you soon."
174356678,I think bcz not all schizophrenics have depression. I am just diagnosed with schizophrenia. My negative symptoms are due to sz and not depression.

174356687,My positive symptoms are way too extreme to improve with aging and without meds. I don’t want to end up in prison or dead.
176057924,I have felt better after a change of meds. It’s totally worth it to try new meds.
176057925,"My goals are to shower more, at least twice a week. Also I would like to engage back to my hobbies like drawing. And I would like to follow through with my physical/nutritional health appointments."
174356684,I disagree. I think all should be worthy of praise for how far they get. This disease is awful and it doesn’t matter the potential someone e has if their will is stripped. Fighting through to reach any level is commendable.

176057936,"My biggest complaint is that my family take too much of the burden, and mental health services should be actively trying to promote people with mental illness to create things like peer to peer support I have been on this site long enough to see the trends in what people are facing, yet in our own communities, many still seem to be stuck in isolation from each other. It really doesn’t have to be this way _USER_ID_ perhaps might be to blame I know that both personally and professionally, I cannot disclose my mental health issues to anyone without fear of a negative reaction and long term consequence of disclosure - if you made an error, you could really suffer There is no way I care about people treating me differently, but it does make things harder for us as a community to have to take that step back and be detached from each other through the fear of not knowing who is an ally or not.

176057944,"My prescriber has finally decided after weeks to take me off Risperdal because the side effects were too much. He wanted to put me on latuda but insurance won’t cover it, so he said he was going to put me on Geodon (assuming I start at the lowest dose) twice a day. He really didn’t go over this medication too much with me, so i’m curious if anyone is/has been on this med and if you had any bad side effects, or just overall what you think about it. I’ve been stopping and starting so many meds the past few months… currently i’m on Effexor, Klonopin, Lamictal, and Trazodone. Appreciate any feedback!"
176057945,"Well, manipulative and dishonest go hand in hand. But not everyone has the capacity to plan ahead and also take advantage of other people’s feelings and weaknesses. Some people are just clueless when it comes to empathy, you can’t blame them. I would had hoped your daughter falls in that latter category, but it seems not. Maybe she feels that every human being is a possible threat to her security or wellbeing? So she does all those schemes in self-defense. Some sort of pre-emptive strike, even against those who obviously love her? Just saying. I’m not psychologist, but I assume if one can understand the inner workings of a sociopath, one can accept them easier ?"

176057952,"i think all psychiatrist have different things they do and believe in for treatment, also meds effects vary for everyone, are you on the med, even if so what one doctor or group of doctors say on the internet still may not be true for every case because all docs can only base what works off of how it works for their patients or what has been shared with them by another doc, all psychiatrists practice medicine so things will always vary because every person they treat is different"

174356689,"I can understand that people cling on to the vaguest hope that there is something positive in getting and having sz, but I think you are clutching at straws here. There is a correlation between szs and smoking weed, but no proof of causation. Time is linear, and in that one can say that they were living one way and then sz happened and their way of living changed at that point, but there is no way to say that even if you didn’t get sz that your life would not have changed anyway. I understand your point, but I beg to differ that sz is the cause for that change. I find it difficult to accept sz as being anything but a negative influence on anyone’s life, outlook and future mindset. I maybe wrong and should try to see it differently, but when a mind becomes skewed by such a devastating warping of the mind and you get put on drugs which ultimately shorten your life then, to me how can a stifled and nullified existence ever compare to a neurotypical mindset whether on drugs or not?"

Why do some do better and some not so much?..I’m pretty sure we’re dealing with the same beast. I’m amazed how similar across communities our symptoms are…but why these differences… Then there’s 1% give or take. Why, with all the associated rubbish we deal with these days do only that slight percentage get what we get?..Yes. Dopamine plays a role but the cause to me is a protein problem on a smaller level."

I was able to interview for and land a new job the same day I got fired which I thought was great, but I never really had time to process what happened. I started my new job right away without having any time to breathe. I barely received any training before they put my on my own(I’m now working front office in the dental field, used to work back office as an assistant) I’m beyond stressed about going back and working again tomorrow. I’m actually beginning to feel suicidal and having symptoms come up. I’ve been trying to get ahold of my mom all weekend and she hasn’t been answering my calls, I don’t know anybody down here where I live. I don’t have any support system around me. I literally feel like I’m about to break. I honestly don’t know what to do. I have to hold things together for this new job, but I don’t know how to work 40 hours a week, I used to bar

174356693,"So, i just figured that abilify was not the culprit in making me ???? my pants. It was actually from working out til complete exhaustion that was causing it. I think it may be from the running aswell. Anyways, when i see my doc again im gonna ask for the monthly injection of abilify at the lowest dose. My schizophrenia isnt really that bad most of the time, but the current risperidone injection im taking has really been slowing me down while not helping as much. Im gonna try schedule a doctors visit soon than the when my next appt is suppose to be, way in September. I also hear the side effects are not as bad as pill form. Does anyone have any experience with abilify injections?"

I’m at the point where my sz/sza/bipolar1 situation is under control even though I had an episode last month. I can carry conversations with people and have thoughts, which is great. Reading is still a struggle but you got to keep fighting and working on it. If.this illness has taught me anything it is that resilience is an essential trait to develop for the trials that one must go through in their lives, and so I feel more prepared for future calamities. Always try to practice gratitude and temperance even when the ???? is hitting the fan.

It’s a small group; it wouldn’t take much to pass it around. If they are no longer “essential”, will they lay him off? I’m scared."
176058002,All kinds of crazy things happened with _USER_ID_ as did with most of us once we were deep in psychosis. I’m sure he probably doesn’t want to get into it since he didn’t reply.

176058006,That’s what happened to me. I was on abilify for years and doing great. My doctor told me I could come off it because I didn’t need it anymore. Went off and was psychotic within a week. Tried to go back on it a month later and it was useless. That was in 2012. I’ve since tried to go back on it several times and always have really bad side effects within days.

He’s also bipolar and we’re working down to no meds for him, been better overall for his mental health to be honest, he doesn’t let people walk all over him and he’ll prove a teacher wrong when they totally are. I was an A and B student, dad was an A and B student, _PERSON_ is smart, but if he wants to learn something, he’s gonna do it when he’s damn well good and ready. Genius coder, but he’s got a career lined up for “if” he graduates high school. I told him I ask him to stay in school and try to graduate, but I get it I really do. He wants to go into programming robotic limbs for veterans and those for whatever reason don’t have all their limbs. But his high school “tracks” only said he can do either nursing track or computer programming…neither are right. That’s my qualms with this school 
district, you have to pick a “career” for a 4 year school regardless if you’re gonna go or not, so even though we have an awesome technical college 15 mins away, they blow it off as not good enough for their statistics. His program is at the technical college, so if he does go to VA after 18 they have the same program in the city he’s going to. He’s got an HVAC apprenticeship set up with a company that several xbox friends he’s hung out with for years have set him up with, hell, they’ve talked to me and explained so I know what’s going on. Now, the oldest guy is my age at 34, but he’s been really cool with us, talks to hubby and I, asks how I’m doing with my walking issues. Ritalin and other stimulants may be right for some, but like for _PERSON_, once he turned to puberty, it wasn’t needed and so age 12 he started skipping it a lot. Ymmv."

176058025,"I havent had a major episode of psychosis in 4, almost 5 years now. It does not just take meds it also takes emphasis on self care as well as other tools to manage your disorder. Meds are probably the most important part though. Anyways when you foresee that life is going to become very stressful or when it does become stressful you have to be prepared for your symptoms to flare up in some way. Medication can really reduce the severity of how bad the flare up will be, but for any symptoms that spill over it helps if you have therapy tools and a good support system. Good sleep is really important too."

You need to be honest and a good shrink will have an idea how your travelling simply from conversation. It’s not easy and there’s really an art to it but if your multi episodic it’s usually meds for life. If your still getting symptoms then that is something you need to stay on meds for.

During that time, obtained an increase in aripiprazole to a dose of 15 mg 1 x 1, however, at home almost immediately stopped taking the medication” ”Patient lacks insight. Feels abused and forced into medication” ”the patient in the income situation was stuck, no affect, not much contact, however, agreed to treatment. There was a discussion with the patient about the given diagnosis of psychosis and the need for medication, she was mixed with the medication or completely in opposition. Consented to injection, Abilify Maintena 400 mg injected for the first time 9.7.”"
176058078,So the healing process of the past is necessery?
176058079,So this may seem weird. But I try to enjoy disassociation. It makes it easier to come back from if I live it like its real. I also have derealization where the world is so brightly colored and much like a cartoon. I just try to remember to go through the motions and typically it’ll be back feeling real by the end if the day. But it can be a wild ride.

His appetite also increased and he began to eat stuff like chips. He took a one hour nap and I could tell that he was a tiny bit stoned, but more calm and easygoing. This morning he woke up and he’s telling me that his back pain has alleviated a bit - less back pain already. _AT_MENTION_ he takes it for back and leg pain. But so far it’s helping him with his anxiety also."

We split on very amicable terms, and I wish them nothing but the best in their life. We both loved each other, we just had incompatible forms of emotional damage, and kept hurting each other when we were together. Nothing abusive, just not a healthy and sustainable relationship. I think if we were both a little more mature, it could have worked out. But I am glad it didn’t, because I have a good life now and I don’t want a different one."

I hired a vegan nutritionist when I was having problems finding good things to eat. She recommended sprouting. I used to sprout peas, lentils, and chickpeas - I bought dried ones in bulk from a food co-op and I always had sprouts going. Even my husband got addicted to them.

176058184,"I feel like it’s a the thoughts we have normally. The only issue is. Whilst the brain fails to prune properly (an ongoing process), the thoughts get cut up. When the thoughts get cut up, we hear it as if it’s our own thoughts - when really it is mean to stay in our subconscious flood stream of thoughts. I feel that if this is happening, we get mostly negative because psychologically we are more negative thinking or feeling to preempt the need for survival. The thing about being negative is apparently scientifically sound? But yeah. Theories about it being spirits and voices from other realms is false because that’s the brain not being able to access the frontal lobe which helps to decide what is real. As a sz, you have psychosis - inability or struggled ability - to access the frontal lobe and that maybe why we find hard to identify what is considered real normally and what is considered false normally. The paranoia (if you experience it), is the brains ability to usually sense fear gone wron

174356750,"What constitutes a full recovery is up for debate even among doctors. I hear people claim a full recovery but I have serious doubts that anyone with schizophrenia can ever achieve the state of absence of all symptoms. I’ve heard people on here claim they have no symptoms but in the same sentence they usually say they’re fully recovered but still take medication!! I’m not trying to discourage anyone from recovering or take someone’s hope away because in my own case I was severely ill through most of the eighties but I have made great strides in my recovery. I am a hundred times better now at age 58 then I was when I first got ill when I was 19-22. So lots of people get better but my theory which some people have agreed with is that once you have schizophrenia for 2 or 3 years I think the damage is done. I believe psychosis changes your brain and affects how you cope with life. When I say cope I mean in the early stages many of us have learned coping methods to function that are unique to sch
izophrenia and are not what a typical person does. I think the mental and even physical changes that having schizophrenia brings would not be completely reversible. For one thing, most men who get schizophrenia get schizophrenia around 18 or 19. It’s a critical age when guys get out of high school and learn their place in society and their roles as adults in the world. Well, schizophrenia throws a monkey wrench in our development. It’s hard to learn anything with schizophrenia and while we are going through psychosis most non-schizophrenic guys are developing fully healthy relationships with women and learning to be responsible adults. The symptoms of schizophrenia is no easier for women but they have an advantage because the typical age for onset is usually their late twenties or early thirties so they had all those extra years men don’t have to integrate into society. Sorry for the lecture but here it is. Some kind of recovery for lots of schizophrenics is a reality. Many, or even most, show some kind 
of recovery as they go along."

176058215,"I think _AT_MENTION_ has got the right idea with being med compliant and trying to improve. Do what is within your power to do. Stick to your medication, slowly try and extend yourself and help your mother where you can. Don’t overdo it and make yourself worse. Then hold your head up high because you are on the right path. Some people that criticise your situation without understanding it are probably just afraid of being in a similar position to you and won’t accept that they are afraid. The rest are just callous IMHO."
176058216,"Getting better takes time. It won’t happen overnight. Like I said before, co-operate with the people trying to help you. I know it can be very difficult to deal with such a serious condition at your age, being a teenager is hard for anyone, even without this disease. I know you want to get better and just get on with your life and not have these problems but it will take work and time. No one wants to be psychotic and no one wants to be on medication. But it happens and you have to deal with it; but you don’t have to deal with it alone. That’s what family and doctors are for."

Someone who pursues philosophy, then, was supposed to be someone who was seeking the attainment of wisdom’. (From Google) The four main branches of philosophy are metaphysics, epistemology, axiology, and logic. 1.) Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality. 2.) Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge. Epistemologists study the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, epistemic justification, the rationality of belief, and various related issues. 3.) Axiology is the philosophical study of value. It includes questions about the nature and 
classification of values and about what kinds of things have value. 4.) Logic is the systematic study of valid rules of inference, i.e. the relations that lead to the acceptance of one proposition on the basis of a set of other propositions. More broadly, logic is the analysis and appraisal of arguments. There is no universal agreement as to the exact definition or boundaries of logic. Radiohead~ ‘Treefingers’. (Album/Kid A).

If you already are, remember you have to take them as directed. Avoid drugs and alcohol. Limit your caffeine intake too. Maybe you can ask your doc for a med adjustment or even change meds.

I would combat a delusion by creating asort of new one to counteract the first one. For a bit I could hardly eat anything. I thought all my food was poisoned. I repeated to myself that packaged food was safe, and that fruit had certain chemicals in them that counter acted the poison making it harmless. I would also pick foods that I wouldnt normally eat.

I genuinely think we might make good partners. _AT_MENTION_, it is interesting what you say about the abuse. I think i have always thought the strong ups and downs were normal and the normal loving boys/men seemed boring and flat. My mum was very emotional…one moment she would be the most intensely loving and caring mother in the world and the other moment she would scream at me that i was the cause of everything bad. Later I always kind of (“accidently”) sought out abusive or intense relationships. I stopped that pattern, but i feel still very awkward in normal dating…I dont know how love is supposed to feel in a good relationship. I also always numbed my feelings of fear of sex.

174356812,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov You say ""schizophrenia"" and I say ""psychosis"": Just tell me when I can come off this medication. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Schizophrenia research, Feb 27 2020 Individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis are likely to respond well to treatment with antipsychotic medications. Of those treated for a first episode of schizophrenia, three out of four can expect to achieve remission. The question of how long antipsychotic medication should be continued has been a topic of heated debate in the field. Longitudinal studies of individuals diagnosed with a first episode of psychosis have reported that as many as 30% may be able to come off of medications without relapsing while treatment discontinuation studies have found that very few patients remain in remission off of medication. This paper reviews the literature on relapse rates following a first episode of schizophrenia and identifies factors that contribute to the discrepancies in the rates reported. These f
actors include sampling considerations, the distribution of psychiatric diagnoses, the duration of follow-up, the rate of medication discontinuation and the criteria used to define illness recurrence. We propose that individuals for whom the diagnosis of their first psychotic episode is determined with ongoing follow-up to be due to schizophrenia are at extremely high risk of relapse and should be advised to continue antipsychotic medication for the long-term. Those whose first episode of psychosis is determined to be due to other causes are also at high risk of illness recurrence off medications. Recommendations for maintenance treatment should be tailored to reflect the risk of relapse and sequelae of relapse associated with specific causes of first episode psychosis."

When I was really into AA, CA and NA and my sponsor took me through the steps he showed me his method of meditation. It was very basic and simple. I did it often and it actually helped but the effects were very brief. It took discipline to do it regularly and I did sporadically for a few years."

176058467,Sounds like you need some therapy and possibly medication to help rewire your brain to learn how to enjoy things sober. I am guessing you already know that getting drunk isn’t a sustainable coping strategy.

I get ‘insane’. I just have my little doubts like aliens and stuff and ‘conspiracy theories’. Like could i be an immortal andriod or humanoid alien experiencing transhumanism from 2036 or beyond? Whats more likely that i cannot truly die or whatever and had all these ‘past life experiences’ or im a schizoaffective depressive type person? Schizophrenia assumes you are wrong or delusional. I dont think any government has the capability to do what happened to me. I mean it has to be aliens. I could be wrong about the last part… For the record, i went through monarch programming as a montauk victim/researcher in my past lives; secret space program victim/abductee; military abductee; illuminati victim; super soldier; time traveler; alien abductee. Happened thousands, millions, billions, or trillions of times. I kee
p coming back alive. Talking helps and Jesus too. Feels like i get schizophrenic dreams and wake up delusional. I felt like we all died in 2012 and im a clone in a simulation, but maybe it was just me or a feeling. People get tired of me. I escaped the simulation, ran it, put it on repeat. I felt heavily and believed and feared and got delusional that im _NAME_ titor mainly. At this point in my life, it wouldnt surprise me if i created bitcoin, and other random stuff too like urantia, _NAME_ stoned by tool, and a book or two by _NAME_ k dick. Personally, i think if history was slightly different the world could have been destroyed by 2017. New world order type stuff. I lived through it thousands if not more times. Feels like millions. It was a different timeline i guess. _PERSON_ effect. I got so much trauma and sadness from past life memories. I get dreams i was possibly _NAME_ parsons and was reincarnated as _NAME_ v. The first person diagnosed with aspergers syndrome in germany during ww2. I was either sen
t there by aliens or was reincarnated there and lived in _NAME_ aspergers hospital. Finally, im stuck living my current life with schizophrenia. Its pretty bad here. I got bad memories of _NAME_ and mars and montauk and other deep underground military bases. Nobody thinks its real."

People found that real weird apparently. But i can wash my feet? I always walk barefoot. Why cant i quickly walk barefoot to the car in front of the house a few times? People walk indoors with shoes too? I have all these little things (and huge ones too) where i just seem to miss something. So many things normies find shocking or important dont bother me.

174356822,"I have seen some people both online and offline who I am basing this off of. It seems to be mainly a thing with young teenagers or otherwise immature people, but I maintain that this DOES happen. I have seen people in real life and in forums, self-diagnose themselves with schizophrenia despite the fact that their symptoms could amount to anxiety/depression, sometimes even DESPITE a doctor telling them explicitly they don’t have schizophrenia. I think some people really do view it as a “romantic disease” a la tuberculosis in the 19th century. Even I will admit as someone who has been crippled by the schizophrenia diagnosis for the past 6 years, that there is something archetypal, alluring, interesting about the concept of madness to people, which is in somewhat of a dialectic with society’s profound stigmatization of it. I had a friend/lover once who stuck around with me for about a year, in her words, because I was “fascinating” but had no problem blocking me when she got sick of the br
utal reality of schizophrenia. I think in some sick way people truly are fascinated by us. Which is both pleasing, like okay, I am not worthless, but it is also really sick and annoying. Sometimes when people find out I am schizophrenic, they ask all sorts of stupid and offensive questions because they are interested. Both friends, acquaintances, AND mental health professionals. Society has a very strange, problematic, and contradictory relationship with madness. I believe this is most evident with the occasional teenager online or IRL who self-diagnoses themselves with schizophrenia. You can also see it in pop culture, like movies, and also popular music (singing about “crazy” and the “voices in my head”). I mean, people say ???? like “everybody’s a little crazy” and in today’s society, mental health problems are HUGE, but that leads to people mistaking their normal life pains for mental illness, which you can see on a lesser degree with young people claiming to have anxiety and depression wi
thout a diagnosis and without a loss in functioning. One of my close friends, when we were younger, I really didn’t like him, because he would self-diagnose himself with a bunch of mental disorders like bipolar, OCD, et cetera. And I think it was because despite a pretty idyllic life (peaceful family, huge trust fund, utterly normal life despite him being an edgy metalhead Satanist to rebel against his parents) he still experienced pain LIKE WE ALL DO, and desperately wanted that validation. Which is normal. And so, yeah, I REALLY DO THINK that some people WANT to pretend to have schizophrenia when they don’t really have it. I’ve seen it. When I was going to school at a mental institution, there was a borderline girl who pretended to have schizophrenia. I actually believed her until it became apparent that her doctors disagreed with her and never diagnosed her with that, and that she was actually borderline. She bragged about being “schizoprenic” too. Always “haha my schizo ass” and stuff like t
hat. She also made up lies about stuff. Said that the kid who was severely developmentally disabled was schizophrenic, and that she had heard the doctors discussing it, which is such bs. The kid was obviously developmentally disabled and hadn’t just “lost his mind” like she said, and there is NO WAY doctors would be discussing a diagnosis with her in earshot. Also pretended to suddenly remember a repressed memory of grave sexual assault in the middle of class… She was in other ways super manipulative. And you better believe I called her on her bs after I figured stuff out. I really do think that people who self-diagnose most likely don’t actually have it, but that somehow they actually WANT it, and I would even go so far as to say there are sometimes cases of _PERSON_ by Internet on different forums… Maybe I’m just paranoid. What do you guys think? And remember guys, it is NEVER okay to accuse someone of “faking” here. That is HUGELY invalidating and honestly should result in a temporary ban
. Even if you suspect anything, you cannot take that risk with someone who is most likely actually schizophrenic."

As I mentioned, his blood work is always good, but because of his age (about seventy) and the potency of Clozapine, the family is doing what we can to make certain he stays safe. He himself doesn’t fully understand the COVID19 situation and potency of Clozapine, not because of the schizophrenia but the mental retardation…he had a congenital brain infection.

My situation hasn’t changed since around 2009. Meaning since 2008 I’ve had a cap on how much I can earn and I haven’t broken it. By cap I mean the disability worker told me that I can earn up to about $1100 a month indefinitely, and still collect benefits. I distinctly remembering her telling me that, but I just got reviewed anyways, just about 6 months ago. The review was a surprise but Social Security didn’t change my benefits. I still work part time and collect my monthly check. Supposedly I won’t be reviewed for another three years. I’ve worked since 1983 and I don’t really remember how I’ve worked so long and still receive benefits. My advice is to get up early one day and call the benefits people and get any answers to questions right from the horses mouth. They will either answer your questions over the phone
, contact you by mail or have you go into an office in person. I say early, because the office can be difficult to reach. Sometimes they can put you on hold for an hour. Other times you can leave your name and phone number and they will call you back when your name comes up in order. I think Mondays and Tuesdays are their busiest time.

176058566,Okay. Now I’ve got my exercise in
176058567,Finishing my shift to be rewarded with 5 days off. Then to be brave even on my off days!
176058568,"I am in bed most of the day. Sometimes I stare at the wall, sometimes I browse the forum. I watch Netflix but not often because the bed is more comfortable and warm. I used to crewchette in bed but I haven’t done that in years. I spend most of my time not active and in bed. My x I lived with accepted that mostly Ha ha ha ha but he spent most of his time on a chair by the computer. But a bed is more comfortable and comfortable and warm than a chair.ha ha ha ha We went well together I think.ha ha ha ha Wish we got our sex on better with sacred Union intimacy and extacy passion but a deep partnership etc worth more even though we didn’t even have the same humour.

I had a Marijuana card around 2012 I think. I got a little paranoid. My vision got really bad for some reason. Could have been the pot. I had poor reality testing, dissociative disorder, and unreality. Not sure why. Trauma a second time? My dp/dr was 10x worse than the schizophrenia. Maybe the delusions got worse after 2014. Maybe supplements caused it? Brain damage? I struggle with money. Al beliek said he advocated for the powers at be to give us 80k or so for college for being montauk boys and going through this ????. But the money isn’t that important anymore. I rather just be safe. I have ptsd symptoms. I tried to get help for 10 years. Only vraylar worked. The clinic I go to is much better and more understanding. I always felt paranoid about that mental hospital I went to. Its much better now. I feel safer now."

174356837,Sounds good. I think I will try it then. Any weight gain?
176058572,Yes. I had a hysterectomy and oopherectomy. Estradiol is safer than other oral hormones because It is from a plant. It does help with dryness during sex. Estrogen creams also help with dryness during sex. Sometimes I still need lube but overall it helps. I haven’t tried the creams yet

Wore my old one out and don’t have space for a new one. I tried the walking track in town, but it’s crowded and there are joggers there who constantly bump into others. Getting touched by strangers is pretty high up on the list of, “stuff that makes me lose my ???? in public.” I really don’t like the walking track. We really need some global warming here, tired of my face hurting when I go outside."

I finally have come to the conclusion I can run but can’t hide from my past. I am happier alone now. I think sometimes being alone is underrated. I have freedom and am unchained. Who needs to be in bad company when I’m happier alone. All my past choices in men have been bad. I tried to make healthier choices for myself but ended up repeating the same mistakes. So, I realized if I can’t make wise decisions about men, then it is my fault. I take responsibility for my failures. Now, I avoid such situations at all costs. I am finally happy!"

176058601,"Usually during a shift I have 4 cups. On weekends I have 2, one when I wake up and one in the afternoon. How much coffee is too much coffee? I know they say a cup of day might be good for you, but I wonder if I’m overdoing it. Coffee just makes me feel normal. More talkative, less lethargic, more focused."

It improved my negatives but had to stop it due to worse issues than negatives, addiction and hypersexuality issues, I lost 100 000$ in gambling with bitcoin, casino, compulsive shopping, etc No more addictions and hypersexuality after I stopped it. My psychiatrist agreed that this was caused by Abilify. I am on Risperdal 4mg."
176058609,yeah i rationalized that it would be better to be poor here but still have my creature comforts of home. but the thought occurs to me sometimes that it would just be a relief to check out of the world and go to an institution.
176058610,It wasn’t the work but i wasn’t good at that either. It was a lot of things. I wasn’t too fond of most of the kids in my grade anyways. But when I was 11 or 12 I started a swift decline where I stopped being healthy and probably had symptoms of sz My obvious answer would be “my mental health made it difficult for me”. But at the time I just hated the kids because they bullied and harassed me along time. I remember being sucker punched in the mouth on my birthday in 2007 (junior year) and my best friend didn’t even come to back me up he just turned around. So even my best friend I couldn’t count on for that much i thought

174356854,"Mine has gotten better over time. I was very delusional at 30 when I first had it, it lasted a couple of years where my family had to stop letting me stay with them because I’d accuse them of outlandish things they weren’t doing. After four or five years the delusions and paranoia went away. The only thing left is hallucinations but I don’t take them as seriously anymore. From what I’ve read the disease most often gets less severe over time. Only a few articles I’ve seen talk about it getting worse. The statistic I keep running into is that 1 in 5 people recover in 5-10 years from the first episode, 3 in 5 recover but still have some times when things get worse temporarily, and 1 out of 5 don’t recover. So there’s always hope that things can improve. I got diagnosed at 30 so I was pretty old compared to most of the people on the forum. I’m just glad I got through the first couple of years because things are so much better now, my family accepted me back and I don’t accuse them of 
anything or have any delusions about what they are doing."

176058646,I have two types of voices. First one is whispers. I can hear someone talking but it’s very faint occasionally il hear my name. They seem to be activated every time I consciously want to listen for silence or enjoy silence theylll start then. They also get triggered times I have an emotional reaction to something usually on tv. Other than that they don’t bother me and go when I get distracted. They happen every time I’m watching tv or relaxing at night The other ones are more persistent their triggered by being overwhelmed at work or stress. Their still faint but their justlouder than my whispers. They seem to go when I remove whatever’s stressing me out. I can tell what their saying sometimes just by the way they react to my thoughts
176058647,"I was never that social even before psychosis. Psychosis just intensified that. My last job was in fast food and every interaction with people, coworkers and customers alike, I equated to the feeling of having my teeth pulled, even if I liked who I was interacting with."

176058662,I did very well on risperidone when I was first put on it in 2005. Went into remission and eventually stopped meds with help of pdoc and for five years I was ok but my sza returned and I was put on risperidone again in 2012. But I stopped it a few months later because it was expensive and I didn’t think I’d need it. I was then put on amisulpride in 2013 and although it was also expensive I remained well when taking it so I didn’t switch back to risperidone again. But it was a good med for me. The only problem I had with it was I lactated from my breasts so i think my prolactin levels were high. And had no libido. With amisulpride I have the same but I don’t lactate anymore except on very rare occasions

People like to watch tv, mess around on the internet, play candy crush on their phones… not to mention everyone has their own inner worlds in which you are not the star. I think it is your own thoughts about this that are torturing you In any case, sorry you’re feeling so stressed about it. Maybe accept that you will never know for sure what your neighbors are doing or thinking so try to stop worrying about it? I know easier said than done. But it’s not good to obsess over it."
174356860,"The term ‘schizophrenia’ was coined in 1910 by the Swiss psychiatrist _NAME_, and is derived from the Greek words ‘schizo’ (split) and ‘phren’ (mind). _PERSON_ had intended the term to refer to the dissociation or ‘loosening’ of thoughts and feelings that he had found to be a prominent feature of the illness. Source: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201209/brief-history-schizophrenia So, like it says in the quote, it was intended to refer to the dissociation or loosening of thoughts. but it was interpreted and still is interpreted to mean multi-personality or literally having a “split mind,” which was never true. Multiple Personality Disorder is what I was referring to, that people mix up with the word “schizophrenia,” that is so incredibly rare that doctors and scientists aren’t even sure if it’s a real illness or made up. To further quote the article: Multiple personality disorder is a vanishingly condition that is totally unrelated to schizophreni

I’m on invega 234mg"

176058674,"_AT_MENTION_ , me and MrSquirrel have been able to reduce our antipsychotic dosage from taking it. It is safe to take with antipsychotics but run it by your psychiatrist just to be on the safe side."
176058675,"_AT_MENTION_ I noticed improvement on Zyprexa in my first week of taking it, and was completely positive symptom free after one month. I don’t have significant nightmares, no. It took almost five years to find the right cocktail for me. Zyprexa 7.5 mg, Lexapro 10 mg, Lamictal 100 mg. With the Lamictal, I had previously been on 300 mg but I started seeing a new pdoc and she wanted to lower that big dose. We went all the way to 75 mg, but 100 is my sweet spot. With the Zyprexa, I had been at 10 mg for two months and then she wanted to see if 7.5 mg would be a good maintenance dose. It is. With the Lexapro, 10 mg is effective so we never went higher."
176058676,This currently sucks. I am setting here kicking just right after tremors from haldol stopped Can’t stop from kicking and saw it could be 42 hours. It has a half life of 5-9 hours with 7 average So I took it at 9 pm. You think I could get some sleep around 4am-5

176058683,What’s wrong with having a little dry skin? Does it hurt or itch?
176058684,"Im sure it is. Its just that the realization should click and be felt, which it isnt. I am just logically aware… Its no biggie. I am just reacting to a small percentage coincidence today Actually, my opinion of the cia isnt really the most favorable though. Some documentaries i saw portrayed them as fascists… like council of foreign relations and banking, etc. Or causing war in several countries, funding and supporting civil unrest, supporting undemocratic dictatorships in exhange for natural resources/mining. Dont want to get into a politics argument. I havent read much history books or done enough research but the ideas can be common among hippie canadians around me. Most were against the war in iraq. Anyway i have decided to detach myself from such topics bc there is no point digging deeper into gov corruption practices."

176058701,Look there’s no facts to what your saying. Your just saying your opinion. I’ve got some stuff on and I’ll sit you down for a night simply because your being confrontational. Meds work over placebo. Yes. They don’t work well for everyone but it’s still better than the pre medication days. Please think of other people which is most of our community. We need meds to even function and even that isn’t the best.

174356882,"I’m not going to argue with you _PERSON_. The first or former happened to me. My theory is I was told or it was hinted I had the Norovirus as a kid and the vaccine could help me. There’s absolutely no proof or relation to my post on the last bit, but yes, I still think it’s possible. I believe I’m the only real _NAME_ in this planet I believe it could be something else I don’t know like bitcoin or qanon but I don’t know. I’m thinking of everything. In my other lives, I escaped the matrix and interacted with it. It confuses me. Aliens messed with me. I was in some programs in my past lives. It shouldn’t matter anymore. Did I join something in this life like the SSP? It’s totally possible I got insanity or schizophrenia but I don’t know. I feel like it’s a trillion to one lives if I ever find out the truth. Maybe I’m just the Unlucky guy that got schizophrenia from all this ???? while everyone else recovers and does better – well most, not everyone. Regarding the timeloop th
ing, it could be aliens for some damn reason that trapped me in this time loop. I may have been to other parallel earths but nothing really changes for me before 2011 I think even on the other planets. It seems like the universe starts for me in 2011 at the earliest normally via consciousness transfer back in time (aka reincarnation at college) or I skip all that and wake up in 2013 now via some p-zombie (no consciousness or self-awareness) modification crap. I don’t know. Nothing changes for me until about 2016. It’s like the universe doesn’t branch according to many worlds theory until I come back and major changes don’t happen at a global scale until after 2015/2016. It’s like we live in a damn computer simulation most definitely. I appreciate your feedback."
174356883,.After my psychiatrist appiontment we decided to add 0.5mg of abilify to my 3mg risperidone to see how I handle abilify. Next month if all goes well we will lower the risperidone by 50 as he said 0.5mg is the equivalent of 1.5mg of risperidone. The goal is to move completely to abilify but will see maby everything will be fine on 1.5mg risperidone and 0.5mg abilify. What sort of side effects did or do you experience on abilify He said I might experience inner restelessness had that with fluonxol but he said its not as bad on abilify. Hoping the change works out for me and that I dont relapse but we taking it slow and increased monotoring which is why I see him next month. Only problem is I might need to pay out of pocket for the extra sessions with him but we still trying to work that out with the medical aid I am paying for.

176058741,"I am a combat veteran but I was a pilot flying helicopters in Iraq. We got shot at but I never got shot or shot down however some weren’t so lucky. Flying over Baghdad during the war was scary. Bullets coming at you from everywhere. Got my adrenaline pumping. Wouldn’t know what adrenaline was if it weren’t for that. We worked 12 hours on and 12 hours off and flew about 8 hours at night or during the day. Mostly at night. All you had time to do was work, take a shower, sleep and wake up and do it again tomorrow. No weekends or days off either. No rest for the weary. You would be surprised at what you could do when you had to. Of course I wasn’t sick then. I probably couldn’t do it now but if the Marine Corps called me back I would go back in a heartbeat but I am on the permanently disabled retirement list so there is no chance of that happening.

I think this is both a psychiatric problem and a neurological problem together. Dont know if its schizophrenia, probably is. I’m 50 years old so dont know if age is a factor or not. I don’t think though I will be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Dont know why I think that. My thoughts are racing.

Lie down in a bed or sit in a chair. Let them do whatever they want and after a horrible experience, they will go away. They will come back again sometime but now you will have experience in dealing with them. And you will feel great once they’re gone because alll the horrible fear you experienced will have ended. You will feel like a skydiver who has jumped out of a plane and is falling down with a parachute to a ground she cannot see feels like when she finally touches the ground. Your parachute will be your sense of existence. Your sense of “I am”. Not I am or I am . Just I am. The one truth you always know as long as you are experiencing anything . Doesnt matter what the anything is. Just experiencing life. Both the good and the bad."

174356915,"Struggling a bit over the holidays. Too much work on my book I guess. It’s hard bringing up childhood memories without crying. My sister told me yesterday that her dad said our mother put her in the oven when she was a baby. I forgot about that one. I know I probably shouldn’t share that, but a lot of my struggles, especially lately are childhood trauma’s. I feel like my schizophrenia is a manifestation of my mind trying to repair itself from the violence."

174356903,"I still think i’m being followed. Somedays not so much, but other days i keep thinking the people are talking about me. I’m able to go out in public without headphones now though, the delusion has slowly been removing itself. I’m also on the fence on whether people are observing me because i have schizophrenia. Especially with how the media portrays people with schizophrenia as homicidal murderers and such."

174356918,"amazon.com Crazy Girl: a memoir Hope that someone decides to check this book out. It goes into pretty fine details of my experiences with schizophrenia growing up, and what it was like first-hand plus all the stuff in between/my thoughts and philosophies. It’s just a portrayal of what it was like–journal entries, ideas, some dreams, etc. really for anyone who wants to understand what it’s like to have this illness/constant battle within the psyche/mind. Attempts to bring some hope clarity and understanding to others too. Some of it may seem a little non-sensical however it really has helped me to write my thoughts down to give me perspective and healing through-out the 15 years of having paranoid schizophrenia. I wrote this book to try and embrace and accept my circumstance/situation and mental illness. Both the darkness/light/more-so poetic."
176058814,"I think the part of some people’s depression is they suspect that we are existing under a crass, maniacal god that would allow for such…if there is a be-all / end-all intelligence and that’s as smart as it became it really doesn’t make any of this look worthwhile. There is the dream realm ‘Bardo’ but I’m pretty sure there’s no use keeping you connected to that if the rest of you is dead as it appears to be a scarecrow to keep the brain stimulated during sleep and frighten it awake if it begins to shut down. Also is ‘Fear of Hell’ the only thing God has to advertise its Life? Like ‘Eat here because the only other restaurant is vegan.’"

176058821,"So I rarely was my clothes or tidy my room. In the past my mother has done it for me. Now I am not letting her in my flat, promising her that I am keeping it tidy, though in reality it is a mess. I have also stopped changing my clothes every day, which probably makes me smell although with my smoking habit I don’t notice it and haven’t noticed anyone else noticing it either. The upshot of this is that my mother has to was my clothes less often. So I am disengaging from giving my mother more work, but I am still not doing the work myself. If my room was tidy, I could invite my mother, or other people round. If I did my own washing, it would make my mother have more confidence in me. I need to deal with both of these things, really as a priority, especially given as I mentioned in another post, how my father is unhappy because he feels he has been stuck with me as a burden. My father does love me, but he questions everything in life, and he told me that the burden I place on the family was causin
g him to question why fathers feel the need to look after their sons and that he would be much better off if he didn’t. He has helped me so many times when I have got into difficulty but he is frustrated that I am not recovering. So anyway, keeping my room tidy and washing my clothes would be a good start to becoming more independent and lessening the burden. I need to try. Thank you."

If I do see them in writing then I remember them very well. I’m a bad listener as I drift away too much but when I read messages I can be much more attentive.

176058838,"I don’t understand why but some days I get into a state of suffering. After a while of that, a door seems to open to the possibility of suicide. Then I feel even worse. It takes maybe 30 minutes or a hour or two to get back out of that. What helps me is close support from family and my social worker. Something that works very well for me is to take a slow walk through department stores looking at the products. Also it seems that any type of activity helps. I guess I am fortunate that the suicidal thinking goes away."

176058870,Maybe but my contract clearly states I have to work 4 hours A WEEK to keep my job. I work 25 hours a week.

It’s a government department and I disclosed this the day I applied. So I’ll take them to court not for money but for my job !!! Also I’m not doing terribly at work she’s not complained.

174356931,Most of the changes seen in patients with schizophrenia are present before the first psychotic episode. But there is no reason to assume that single-episode psychosis would be any easier to spot in a single MRI than schizophrenia. Your MRI is completely irrelevant when it comes to your current psychosis/SZ diagnosis.
176058878,I had all but not at the same time.
176058879,Take a break from overthinking.

176058884,yea i don’t care much about the diagnosis too… it changes now and then. Now i been on same diagnosis for a while but they still are doubting but as long as the meds are working i’m fine =) and _AT_MENTION_ i don’t think this place is unhealthy for someone like you. I think it’s good to be among people with similar problems… can help each other huh… also don’t obsess too much over your diagnosis as it might change still anyways.

176058898,"I have not smoked weed in a long time. I have been afraid to smoke it because it has caused Psychosis in me in the past. These experiences I am relating happened when I was smoking marijuana. I have never understood the experiences and I really do want to understand what I experienced. I just want to understand. When I am not smoking marijuana I am not Psychotic at all. It just seems that the Psychotic symptoms start happening after I smoke enough marijuana. Regarding the clicks, I described in the last post, I remember one night when I was laying in bed and these clicks were literally happening all over the room all around me. On the ceiling. On the walls, Everywhere around me. I was totally freaked out by that experience. But it seemed completely real to me. If you want to tell me that I was hearing auditory hallucinations in my own head then I tell you that I literally cannot distinguish between real sounds outside of myself and sounds inside my head. How can anyone distinguish that? Its like I 
entered into an altered state of reality when I smoked enough marijuana and things happened in that state that do not happen in my straight state, and I cannot tell if its real or in my mind. Does that make sense?"

I’ve learned to depend on myself for happiness, and that’s not talking in a depressive way either. Love yourself, be happy with yourself, realize that you’re awesome. It’s also nice to have people in your life that make you happy as well. But both things are very important."
176058910,"I think if you are not born with it and then you get it later on in life, it could be due to a genetic predisposition This is my theory on genetic predisposition: the szc gene is in your dna but it is not expressed, then when you are in your environment and certain environmental triggers are consumed, or experienced, it ‘wakes up’ the szc gene (via epigenetics maybe etc) and then it is expressed. so then you have got szc. tadahh"
176058911,"You would not even believe what happened at my appointment yesterday… or maybe you guys would unfortunately, it sounds like this b***h isn’t one of a kind. I got called back 10mins late, but brought the journaling she had suggested during our last visit. Just bullet points describing 5-6 other delusions I’ve been through since the first, about 2-3 sentences each. And tried to go in with a calm positive attitude! She asked the usual update questions, I explained what had happened to my mother in-law a few days after our last appointment, so she went through each question again regarding how my _PERSON_’s death affected me, etc. Then I told her that I was still feeling good about my medication decision, told her I’d written a little about my other delusions, that my husband was supportive of my choice and is the one person that is actually pretty good at talking me down, and he wants to meet her & give her his perspective. By the way, all of this info she should have known already after my 
multiple calls/messages since our last visit but was very obviously hearing it for the first time I was opening my journal and jabbering on about how I know she and I hadn’t had time in the past to get to this other stuff, but she held up her hand like a f*****g stop sign and said “Sure, I could speak to him and go over whatever it is you’ve written down, maybe next time ask for a 40 minute appointment instead of 20 and we’ll have time for that sort of stuff.” I was taken aback by that, especially because I’d only been in there for 5 minutes at that point, and said “Do you maybe want to just read the bullet points while I have it here?” and held it up for her. She looked and sounded very frustrated and said “Well how long is it exactly??” I opened the page for her to see (from across the room) and she started shaking her head immediately saying “No no no, that’s wayyyy too long, maybe next time.” She could see I was disappointed, but just trucked right along, saying “You know, if y
ou really aren’t planning to go back on your meds in the next couple of weeks, I doubt your insurance is even going to COVER the appointments anymore, I dont know if you’ll want to make CASH payments. I mean, do you know how long it will be before you’ll want to start taking them again?? Don’t you still see a therapist in this office too?” I said “Yes I do, I have an appointment with her scheduled. And I can’t say I’ll NEVER go back on them, I know the odds are stacked against me in this, I just feel like this is right for me right now, my husband is supportive of my decision, and it’s just something I have to do for MYSELF.” still staying calm She launched into changing my diagnosis again right away… saying stuff like it just wont make sense to keep this diagnosis if I’m not being treated for it and opting out of her medication recommendation, that my symptoms and original delusion up to this point can all be exhibited with PTSD, that not EVERYTHING I’ve said is PTSD related but may
be blahblahblah (I think she was implying I have either exaggerated or have been faking). All the while she was explaining this to me, I was losing it… my eyes welled up, I felt more helpless than I EVER have with a pdoc, I WANTED to just run out of there. She got done with her speech and looked at me (crying) like I had just taken a $#!@ on her floor and said “Clearly what I’ve just said has made you FEEL a certain way?” I started STREAMING tears at that point and told her how my SZ diagnosis helped me, how her saying she might rediagnose has scared the hell out of me, thats why I’d called/messaged so much the past few weeks, because if I’m only suffering from PTSD than what the hell is wrong with me, then I lost all sound and needed a tissue and to regroup. Her phone rang. She picked it up IMMEDIATELY, almost looked relieved that there was something to distract her from my mess, chatted with someone for a couple of minutes about her schedule and another patient, while I gazed out the window and 
calmed myself down a bit. She hung up, said “sorry, busy schedule” saw me take my mask off to blow my nose and said “we REALLY encourage everyone to keep masks ON” she looked SO uncomfortable btw “it’s for EVERYONE’S safety… So, I think you may have taken what I said the wrong way somehow. You clearly have had a strong reaction…” At this point I was calm, angry, and done with her. I just stared at her blankly. She looked at the clock, motioned to her own face and said “You wanna tell me what you were thinking about?” I just flatly said “I was thinking about all of my most severe psychotic episodes, and the friends and family I’ve actually scared away.” She said “You mean by harming yourself?” I said “No… scared them off by thinking they were a god, or asking them if I was dead, if they were real, from them seeing me talk to no one, I’ve lost nearly everyone…” She started backpedaling hard, said stuff like maybe there ARE SZ indicators, she hasn’t really seen me en
ough to be sure. Started asking me more “how have I been feeling” questions, I answered emotionlessly, asked if I had any thoughts of harming myself, then said “Any further PTSD symptoms?” I looked at her with fire blazing in my eyes and said (calmly) “I dont know, what would those be exactly?” She said “Any anxiety or ruminating over your past trauma for example?” And I said “Well I guess so, mostly while coming up with that list for you.” She said “Oh, well yeah ok.” Started typing for a good 20 seconds or so, then wrapped it all up saying we need to schedule our next appointment for 30 days, if I needed anything to call her office (HA!) or go to the emergency room, and 10mins after I came in for my 20min appointment RUSHED me out of her office. I walked out without saying goodbye, without stopping at the front desk, called my husband blubbering in the parking lot, and watched as the security guard just HAPPENED to take a stroll outside until I was gone… I started writing a shitty 
letter to her, then thought of posting it as reviews, now I think I’ll wait after reading your post _PERSON_. I have NEVER felt so powerless and scared of a pdoc… and NEVER felt so uncared for by ANY doc. She didn’t remember a single thing from past visits without reading her notes, didnt care to hear anything I had to say, tried to threaten me into going on a double dose of APs, TOOK A ??????? PHONE CALL WHILE I WAS COMING UNGLUED, cut MY appointment in half for something/someone else, and who knows what the hell she’ll do now after that! WHAT THE ???? WAS SHE TYPING, I’m legitimately terrified and dying to know what “NOTES” she took from this visit… I HAVE to report this to someone, and how do I go about getting my records/notes from her??? I feel like she fully expected I was a serious danger when I left, and she did nothing… just wanted me gone."

174356934,"As I said; Any form of chemical change (in the front / reversal mental processes )that can be found in the basic nature of people with sz,must occur After the onset of psychosis and be ended or be completely eliminated during the period of sleep Then the change will return and it appears again to start from the zero point after the waking in the next day Where, the amount of changes accumulates gradually over time throughout the waking time of the day,causing an increasing in the attention level and lose an amount of the chemical energy These changes are the reaction of the psychotic factor functional activities on the motor pathway of the electrochemical singles ( that move between cells of the different brain regions which they are concerned with executive the higher mental processes,emotions and carry with them the cognitive commands that direct the personal behavioral responses outputs The psychotic factor has linking with the signals outputs which coming from the receptors cells,translate its 
decoded cognitive content by vocal mechanism (reading the thought content phonetically ) …etc It means practically, it is impossible to present a permanent chemical change in the chemical background Before the onset of psychosis (the emission of the hallucinations entities in the time-place of the conscious state of the human host),and there is no any type of chemical change occurs during the sleep time Therefore,the correct rational understanding that matches the realities of the internal event scenarios: -The absence of a permanent chemical change during 24 hours (sleep /waking) -The absence of an abnormal chemical change related defective gene, -The absence of an abnormal change that precedes the onset of psychosis or causes -The chemical change (whatever it was) occurs Gradually during the passage of waking time ,it is a result of the psychotic factor effect on the course of the higher knowledge processes -The effect stops and no chemical change occurring the period of sleep (whatever the causes of the

But to answer your question, i think working with an OT can help negative symptoms. I learned that its like a disconnect from the mind and body. Idk, i could be off base, everyones different.

176059033,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_ there’s usually a reason. It’s only been a week. Perhaps she’s been too busy, or perhaps she read it and thought “I’ll get back to it later”, and then forgot about it. You could always send her that follow-up email I mentioned, what’s the harm? Insted of getting pissed because you think she’s ghosting you on purpose, try to remember there could be a million different reasons why someone goes AWOL for a week. And those reasons may be innocent and/or have nothing to do with you. It could all be a misunderstanding, and if you send that email I mentioned, you show that you are still interested, AND you remind her to reply in case she forgot. Communication is a two-way street, but sometimes you gotta honk the horn to make the other car go"

176059060,"halloween 1990 was my first psychosis. i was 23 years old and healthy. everything was fine when i went to bed. I woke up with a big gasp and immediately felt an evil presence. Nothing like i had ever felt before. I sleep with mny radio on all night and i could here evel demons tormenting me on the radio. The voices would have deep evil sounds and they were testing me to see how much stress i could handle. The voicesa would take it to the limit and then ease some of the pressure and then get hard again. My mind was racing with every horror movie I have ever seen being downloaded inbto my head at once. Like freedie kruger, _NAME_, alien, ect. I sensaed the presence of the dark one, the devil himself outside my bedroom door. I could even smell his presence. I was scared to do anything, everythought i had, like turn off the radio was met by the thought of it will get worse if i do anything to try and help myself. I was frozen in my bed. then i thought if i stay in my bed freedie kruger would get me thr
uogh the mattress. so i thought i should get out of bed, but then the devil is at my door and he would get me. i started to ask jesus for help even though i didn’t know if he was real, but if there was ever a time i needed his help it was now. I started to think that if i stayed in the room freedie kruger would come through the walls and take me. I thought thatt i had to open the door and see if the devil was there. I told my self that if i opened the door that it would be like me actuall standing up to the devil and i could scare him away. the amount of anxiety and stress was over the moon, my heart was racing a million miles an hour. everything was in slow motion and i didn’t no how to get any relief. the felling was impending doom. so i chose to be a man and take on the devil. i looked under the door to see if i could see a shadow, there was none. I grabed the door handle and slowley turned it, cracked open the door and peaked out. nothing. what to do next? do i go into the bathroom and look in the mir
ror. See the thing is when i woke up my body felt different. It felt like it was a different body and face that i had. It felt so strange, i was scared of what i might see in trhe mirror. I might see freedie kruger in the mirror and get trapped in the bathroom. It didn’t really matter what choice or decision i made there was no easy way out. I didn’t go in the bathroom, i decided to go around the corner and down the hall to the family room. I made it to the tv room then i thouhgt should i turn the tv on or will a demon come out of the tv. Whatever decision i made i felt like it could be my last. I turned the tv on. The voices on the tv were the same as the ones on the radio. I looked for a programme that would be safe for me to watch. I fould match game, a family game show. The six stars on the show were dressed in reall halloween costumes. Not like normal where you can tell there fake costumes. ONe of them was dracula with real blood and drooling and teeth. The stars of the show were acting evil and doin
g strange things. _PERSON_ was a bad idea but if this is how bad a family show would be if im chanfed the chanell how much worse could it get. just by changing the _NAME_ to try and get relief, it might make things woesr. I might open a portal to hell if i hit the wrong channel. what to do? i turned of the tv. Went into the kitchen, where i found a note left by my mom only saying BLIND MAN IS COMING> This ment that a blind man was coming to the house for some reason. I thught this was going to be the devil himself. I need help. I cant stay in the house and meet anyone in the state i was in. I krept back to my bedroom and got dressed. Im going for a drive, but wait what about the impending doom and a car accident. I was not functioing normally. I was running froom the house. I go to the garage and there was 5 dollars and some change ontop of the stair for some reason why was that money there? I thought it was a sign that i wqas making the right choice. All this time i was asking for help from jesus. I started 
to think that this was my time on the way out, if i die i die. There is nowhere to hide. Where do i drive to thtas safe. I need to go to a church, but which one? zi drove to the church in tsawwassen, but got cold feet when i got there. I know what about the first church i ever went to on _NAME_ rod in delta. My best friend in college and hi smom took me theere fjor the first time whne i was 17."

176059063,Yes I was dancing in the street also lol I look back and I dint know what I was thinking…
174356962,"Hey everyone. I’m feeling really down tonight. It’s been a few weeks since my girlfriend and mother of my child has left and started dating another man. I have good days and bad. My girlfriend was diagnosed with schizophrenia over a year ago. We got into a argument recently and she completely lost it. Tried to spray me with pepper spray. She kicked me out along with all my things. After a week she started dating another man and began posting pictures on social media. I am heartbroken and devastated. Just weeks ago she loved me and wanted to get married but now she is so cold hearted. She has cut off all communication and blames me for everything. There are times I just cry and wonder why this is happening. We had a life together, made plans , finances, and what I thought was a unbreakable love. The same day she kicked me out she emptied my savings account. She left me with debt and has no remorse. I’m left to pay everything while trying to hold my self together. Even though I know she has a M
I, I still question is it my fault and could I have made a difference. We were not a perfect couple , nor was I the perfect man but I never saw this coming. I am currently living with our 12 year old daughter and I can see how this effecting her. The first time my ex was hospitalized I was the one to take her to the hospital because I knew something was terribly wrong. They kept her at the ward the same day and ever since she has blamed me for ruining her life. When she came out the hospital she never took her meds and never accepted her diagnosis. Things were good for a few months until she became angry with me and cut off all communication. Long story short she started dating another man and took me to court for domestic abuse. She got a restraining order on me and I couldn’t see my daughter for weeks. She said terrible things about me and tried to alienate me from her. She tried to take my daughter away. She eventually ended up on the streets from a overdose and almost died. After she recovered, she aban
doned me and my daughter for 6 months until one day she called and wanted to try again. Those were the worst 6 months of my life. Me and my daughter both got counseling. I still loved her and still do. I took her back with open arms. After praying for her every night and missing her so much it was the best feeling to have her back. I told myself I would never turn my back on her. What if it was me who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 28. She has dreams of being a police officer. She is a beautiful, smart, caring , funny ,person. Things were good again for about 6 more months until this most recent incident. I feel lost, weak, and hurt. It’s like she is still her but a completely different person. How can all her love just vanish. The thoughts of her with this other man kill me. I don’t know how I will pull through . I fear she will marry this man and have another child. That is what she really wants. As I write this I feel the tears starting to form and like many nights they will run down my 
face with the pain of loosing the woman I deeply love. We have known each other since 15 years old. Our whole life is just being thrown away. It seems like she is so happy without me. I wish this upon no person. If anyone has any advise or words I would love to hear them ."

We prepped my son on common interview questions, reminded him to say “Sir” or “Ma’am”, and told him to say “yes” instead of “yeah”. So we thought he was all kinds of prepared. Then, when the manager met him, he just took him to the back, got him a shirt that fit, and told him when to start. So I think it will be pretty easy. All the same, I will check out those articles.

176059108,Why I say the group doesn’t matter on functioning is because it really depends on what group you feel more support and connection. Being in a group with different goals might be advantageous but a group that might struggle more could identify if you have problems yourself and maybe you could inspire the too.

174356986,"I had to change my glasses RX after 3 different ones, but it’s been too long to remember which ones. What they did from 2007-2012 was try me on everything antidepressants, APs, the one from BMS got me a few that were not FDA approved but were Europe approved. But with reactions, full out allergies, or just not working on anything or helping I was switching drugs or maxing doses every 2 weeks. In 2012 we finally went back to Zyprexa and Prozac, aka Symbyax, but we did the zyprexa and prozac so we did doses that were not medically healthy or smart, but I was zombies but didn’t sleep…it was hell and I did that until March 2019. The reason we stopped it to begin with is after I tried it back in like 2010 my triglycerides ended up at 1500 after a month, my cholesterol was really bad, etc. And I was in SD in a town where nearest fast food or restaurants were 100 miles away, and I only made that trip when I was forced other than once a month when I went grocery shopping for the month. I was on a ton 
of anticholesteral meds, after that month. And the weight gain of 70 pounds in a month. But I went back on it when my GP begged me to just pick something as it didn’t mess with my blood sugar numbers, and she like the triglycerides numbers, esp since a normal number is like 150 or lower, but since we could move dosages around she did what she could. When I moved to WI in 2014, I went thru 3 pdocs in the office by 2016 because they do not stay with Mercy Health. I got that woman pdoc, she was just as evil as the one from BMS in SD. She’d get her heart on a drug that was new, and just change me to it no talking, our RX is all faced over to Walgreeens, so she’d say pharmacy will explain to you when you pick up. I finally told her March 2019 I was done with meds. I weighed 270lbs, i had dieted, i had been going to gym etc. That ????? is the reason I took Vrylar and even though my throat and tongue swelled up, she insisted to try this and then when she saw my physical reaction the next week she said take 12 
benadryl a day, upped the dose. I did that for 6 weeks, then i dropped her as a doctor and the med and did as my therapist who saw me every other week said to do. Therapist filed a complaint against pdoc as a professional colleague, I filed against state license board and Mercy itself. I ended up in August 2019 in ER in such a panic attack as I was unable to do anything but drool, because tongue took up my mouth, and I thought I was gonna die. So i went to ER and they assumed my panic attack was drug withdrawal from street drugs, i started throwing up uncontrollably and my husband had to tell them to ??????? look at the physical reaction. It took them 2 hours before they did a blood and pee test to check for drugs and they were not believing it came back clean. But the nurse came and did a hip injection of an antinaseau med which stated you have to be standing or lying flat to receive in hip, she had me hunched over a bucket, and the needle went in wrong and the stuff ?????? my hip joint. That is when i lost 
the ability to walk at 34 years old. I’ve been on a cane since then, but I’m bed ridden pretty much. That’s why mynpost about pain management the other day was my good news in so long, and i framed the ??????? letter i got from Mercy this March saying _PERSON_ lost her ability to practice psychiatry in our county. I got a new pdoc back in October and she’s wonderful, but i take my husband to every appt to every doctor now, because he oks or says no to things. But we found out after i filed against _PERSON_ she was still allowed access to my files and she put notes in saying i had kids that if my husband ever decided to dump my ass i shouldn’t get anything but court supervised visits, and just notes that were to ???? me over lifewise. Current pdoc could see the dates things were entered so she had to file with Mercy for inappropriate access to revoked permissions on a patient file, and we found out she looked up my son’s file too. So i went scorched earth as did my husband and we went after Mercy h
ealthcare. I ended up getting a bunch of bills removed, but we had to keep the notes _PERSON_ put on so that we have that as court was brought up, since Covid happened i don’t know if we’ll ever end up as part of the legal case against her, but if they ask for say a written statement I’m ratting her out. We got Walgreens to flag certain drugs to be kept available copies of what her doses and reasons were so they can be printed to take or be given as evidence. I don’t like when you intentionally misdo your job, she wasn’t looking to help anyone, and it wasn’t just us that did complaints. But i am doing my 4mg of xanax a day, plus 2mg prn if needed extra, but my husband and I attend therapy appts together, and see pdoc together, and we’ve got pain management now, so we’re getting things together because yeah I’ve lost 130lbs and all that, but I just stay in bed. My kids are 13, almost 15, and 16, they basically just do their thing right now. Lockdown is until June here now, so _NAME_ and I do 
groceries once a week, nothing else is open, and that is my moving for 2 hours a week. Sorry, this got long, but I woke up as it’s pain med time and saw you responded to me. I’m gonna take my meds and try to sleep until 7pm."

I hate make-up and grooming & so on. I resent it. I love hiking & when I hike I dress for comfort only. I look like a scarecrow and don’t care at all. There are no mirrors & no people to judge my appearance, just the birds & trees & the wind. From what you’ve said, what’s more concerning is isolating in the home.

Personally, if I was in your situation, I would just accept it and move on, talk to friends, family, and outside doctors or referalls or something. I don’t know how socialized medicine works there, but you should, in my opinion, have freedom to get help. MRIs aren’t expensive. They should just give you one to ease your concerns and save your life. You should not go anywhere. It’s super dangerous. I think Turkey is a dangerous country and you might get in trouble and never come back. I know I sound paranoid, but it’s true. It’s not like you’re going to Canada or America. I think Mods should talk to bobbilly and stop what’s going on or have someone report him because he’s a danger to himself. Just my two cents. At least you posted and talked to us because keeping it 100% secret is stupid. We’re hear to help. We care. T
hanks for opening up and talking to us. I hope you are safe and get better."

176059252,Thanks! I love Nirvana. All the boys I grew up with who taught themselves guitar played Nirvana unplugged. Of course it was also the 90s.
176059253,I’m currently taking zyprexa and so far not too many bad side effects. The one thing I hate about it is that it makes me so restless that I can’t get to sleep. I get up and walk around at night. I take Cogentin now and it helps with that. I also get a dry mouth in the morning. I will say you need to take it at night.
174357003,"I take 20 mg of Zyprexa augmented with 20 mg of Namenda and, strangely enough, while it didn’t do a lot for my negative symptoms (other than making me more pro-social) it DID halt a couple positive symptoms as I titrated up on it over several months. To date there’s only been one study showing this can happen, at least that I’ve seen, but it seems to be correct. Namenda combined with Zyprexa or Clozaril doesn’t just improve negative symptoms but positive ones as well. I wonder what it is about them and the way they work together with Namenda that causes this…"

176059256,"Who are you referring to about the drugs? Nobody’s replied to, or tagged, so I don’t know if I’m going on the defensive or not because I only have ever used legally RXed medications, drugs are not a thing ever for my life. Never touched any of it. Just so I don’t end up making an ass out of myself and going off for something like that."
176059257,"Im supposed to take 25mg quetiapine twice daily, but i usually dont bother. 99% of the time the injection keeps me stable. I always do 300 or 600 mg at night tho - cant sleep without it, and i like the anti-depressant effects on that dose in the mornings."

176059268,"Go Butterflyy! You can do it! I found a good solution for when you want to really fill up your tummy. I bought a bag of Green Giant Broccoli Slaw yesterday - it’s very coarsely chopped green and purple cabbage, carrots, and broccoli. I put some _PERSON_’s Apple Cider Vinegar on half the bag and could only finish half of it. I am SO FULL! I am not used to this feeling anymore, it’s actually uncomfortable. I let myself eat past comfortable because there was still so much left in the bowl, but then I gave up. It also has a very satisfying crunch since it’s coarsely chopped unlike most pre-made slaw mixes. Takes a lot of chewing! Need to binge? Eat a bag of this broccoli slaw, you will get VERY full!"

I wouldn’t be so hard on myself about sticking to 10 am in the morning if I were you. That’s too tough a schedule for those of us who lie awake in bed at night, a lot of times, and have to sleep in in the morning. Why not do as I do with my yoga practice and do your Tai Chi in the evening hours when you know you are going to be awake? That will make it much easier on you. Also, it will have the added benefit of helping you to sleep at night. Which it does for me."

I kind of like him but dislike how he treated me. He abused me mostly psychologically but also physically and held a pillow to my face almost killing me saying if it wasn’t for not wanting jail he would kill me. My mum never defended me. He never abused her. He used to say I’m not a part of their family when I was 13-adult. He is incredibly articulate,intelligent and charming. At a dinner he will make the table laugh, charm them all and captivate them. When I was was tortured by voices 24/7 delusional etc I said something about killing my best friend because of delusions I had. I was insane and innocent actually in my opinion now. I am very peaceful person but was so tortured by symptoms 24/7 I wasn’t myself."

What people don’t realize is that, he was sometimes released on a field trip as an agent of Central Intelligence. He once stopped a terrorist threat just outside of the San _NAME_ museum of Technology, he sniffed a bomb threat and beat the hell out of some terrorist but he did not stomp him in front of our field trip. Matter of fact, he beat the daylight out of that fool and then yelled, “Somebody call an ambulance!” Our class wasn’t the only one on that field trip at the age of 11 years old."

It could be censorship/algorithms or bad modding (no offense). Like some one said earlier the encrpytion on this website is very weak. I thank God for the 2 factor authentification which is added security which is nice. I heard a few months back this website got DOS’d or something like that and I am sometimes worried info could be hacked or a back door could be placed here. Google censors (search engine) websites they don’t like or want to get rid of. I don’t know. These are my thoughts. I know I am censored on youtube, facebook, and possibly even Twitter. From my perspective, I think there should be stricter rules on freedom of speech and not a free for all on what people can say or think. Same goes for me I think, but mine has been in a defensive nature and wanting to get the proper help and guidance. I try to stay in the moral and legal framework. A lot 
of people don’t talk about aliens or even believe in them anymore. I think stuff happened to me and I never got the proper help or guidance or assistance. I use this website as a cry for help and to vent I think as well as being able to socialize and get out of my head, I guess."

When I was psychotic, I believed that my death would save the world, and I still couldn’t take my own life, or find someone who was willing to take it for me.

That’s a very efficient way to get booted out onto the streets. Caretakers and family members can only take so much stress before they have to consider their own mental well-being as a priority. I’m glad I don’t have this problem. I experienced schizophrenia for a couple of years and then most of my symptoms fell away in the months to follow with the help of medicine. No more delusions, paranoia, hostility, or derealization. No more word salad or thinking I’m a god or that other people aren’t real.

Maybe it was all real and psychiatric help isn’t needed? Maybe it all is just a lie, for whatever unknown reason? So many questions, and no answer is seeming to stick with me, no satisfaction yet, no peace. Maybe delusion? But I shouldn’t be aware of possible delusions, right? Uhg, wtf am I? Liar? sick?

A few days ago I saw a green laser (which I assume is directed energy) beamed at my face from a helicopter.

I think just like a lot of facets of life, you need a yin and yang of your position naturally in life in juxtaposition with the directions your meds put you in. Sorry for confusing vocabulary but until I found the right balance I was not functional. Now I can do more but my mind tells me I can do less. But it’s more realistic and grounded. I am fairly functional but I do what I have to. And every day I do a little bit more."

174357030,"This article claims that memantine is safe and effective in the treatment of negative symptoms and neurocognitive performance of schizophrenia. It’s a prescription drug for Alzheimer’s.

A _NAME_-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of memantine, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist, in the treatment of schizophrenia.Standardized/weighted mean differences (SMDs/WMDs), risk ratio (RR), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and analyzed.Included in the _NAME_-analysis were eight RCTs (n = 452) of 11.5 ± 2.6 weeks duration, with 229 
patients on memantine (20 mg/day) and 223 patients on placebo. Adjunctive memantine outperformed placebo in the measures of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale negative symptoms [SMD: -0.63 (95% CI -1.10 to -0.16), p = 0.009, I 2 = 77%], but not in the total, positive and general symptoms [SMD: -0.46 to -0.08 (95% CI -0.93 to 0.22), p = 0.06-0.60, I 2 = 0-74%] or the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale [WMD: 0.04 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.32), p = 0.78]. The negative symptoms remained significant after excluding one outlying RCT [SMD: -0.41 (95% CI -0.72 to -0.11), p = 0.008, I 2 = 47%]. Compared with the placebo group, adjunctive memantine was associated with significant improvement in neurocognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [WMD: 3.09, (95% CI 1.77-4.42), p < 0.00001, I 2 = 22%]. There was no significant difference in the discontinuation rate [RR: 1.34 (95% CI 0.76-2.37), p = 0.31, I 2 = 0%] and adverse drug reactions between the two groups.T
his _NAME_-analysis showed that adjunctive memantine appears to be an efficacious and safe treatment for improving negative symptoms and neurocognitive performance in schizophrenia. Higher quality RCTs with larger samples are warranted to confirm these findings."

I don’t think the synchronicities happen when the brain is 100% healthy and calm. The brain in that state just doesn’t care to observe those synchronicities anymore since it’s so relaxed. I feel some of thought broadcasting is subjective, where you’re just picking out and correlating events due to an exaggerated fight-or-flight mechanism (brain is on tilt with stress), and some of it is metaphysical and woo-woo, where the brain is either fabricating some sensory data, or it’s compelling people to behave in a certain way.

The ant looks around to his world, the trees, the flowers, and thinks “If there is nothing beyond that wall, then this here is everything!”. He smiles and is content with what he has.

Also, I pretty much discard homeopathic remedies and energy healing and other bunkum with no scientific backing, or that rely on the placebo effect.

She was a great and nice woman and I used that for many mental health days afterwards. I was always pretty good at school. I was smart till I was 15 then I spiraled downwards. Still.

I’d just end up in pain/damaged/etc. Point is, this place (opens hands and arms to imply all of reality) isn’t as real as we all see it to be. And I don’t mean there are shady players in the background as I once thought but that reality follows such an arbitrary set of rules just close enough to regularity that we fall for it. In a way, I’ve found how to stir and steer my reality to be how I want. It isn’t without cost or risk, and doesn’t include any kind of ‘unnatural forces’ or paranormal juju. It’s truly surprising what one can change with just a thought."

I just know the world changed for me and I became disabled. Not sure why. In college, a few people claimed and said I didn’t like people. I noticed people gave me dirty looks and stuff and I don’t know why. I think nobody gives a ???? about a college drop out and especially a male these days. My family can handle so much. I became delusional that I was _NAME_ and I used those posts to believe they could help me and that I cannot trust anyone in this world. Even the aliens had it out for me.

It’s primarily in my head but I feel it in my arms and hands too as if I wouldn’t be able to lift them. My eyes are closed and it feels sort of like being warmed in the sun on a cool day, so good, and I go weak. I think if it were to happen to me when I was standing i would go weak in the knees too. But it’s not a scary or bad feeling in any way. It’s bliss. It’s pure bliss. Like a cat laying in a chink of sun. It’s starting to get more frequent now. I wonder what it is."

176059469,"So I had what i thought was a cool little email exchange with this female singer/ songwriter…she asked for my lyrics which I sent her…and then nothing for about a week now.

176059476,You really need to adopt my attitude towards meds. I don’t think I’m delusional. But everyone around me does. So I take my meds just in case. I really struggle with agreeing with others about my situation. But I still take my meds. It doesn’t hurt me to pop some prescribed pills everyday. If I could afford a shot I would totally do that. It’s so much easier that way. It’s just not a big deal for you to get a shot every few weeks. Just suck it up and do it
176059477,why do you post and not like a response? everybody else is in gratitude for anyone who responds.

174357058,"I seem to be making myself really unpopular with how I see it on the forum lately. But I am just describing to you how I overcome the illness, and I am not going to pretty it up for you and tell you meds saved me because that is not what happened. I stopped hearing voices when I stopped believing you could communicate with people in your head. After about 6 months I stopped hearing voices and after about 4 or 5 years my insight, negative symptoms, ruminating and other problems all went away too. I imagine my head was full of dopamine at the time, I mean who wouldnt in the middle of such a terrifying experience, but to me it was not the other way around where if your head is flooded with dopamine you will start hallucinating, because that is just not the way I see it. You guys might hate me for saying that, but that is exactly what happened to me and exactly how I experienced recovery. All the meds in the world would not have made a difference if I didnt get rid of that key delusion. _USER_ID_: I am 
not saying meds dont help by the way. If your head is flooded with dopamine you are going to be extremely stressed out, and meds could alleviate that. I am just saying I dont think dopamine is the reason we hallucinate."

I came to a point where having some positive symptoms and some catatonia is better than the severe negative symptoms I now have… I wake up everynight having difficulty breathing… Is that fear real?"
174357054,"Blocking dopamine can cause negative symptoms sometimes. My psychiatrist said negative symptoms are caused by an imbalance of dopamine even without meds in the brain, some parts of the brain have high dopamine while others have low dopamine. He said there is no meds that target specific brain parts, antipsychotics block dopamine in all the brain. Partial dopamine regulators like Abilify, Rexulti and Vraylar sadly also work on ALL the brain but they can be better sometimes because they boost dopamine when its low and block dopamine when its low. Though we don’t know if it does that to every part of the brain and what’s the normal balanced dopamine levels. There is no universal dopamine levels in humans as far as I know."

176059580,"…Storytime! About 5 years ago, I had a psychotic episode that led me to be hospitalized. When I was in the hospital, a nurse-in-training was there. I didn’t see her throughout my hospitalizations, so I assumed that I was safe. I knew her from church, and we weren’t on good terms because she fought with me. But, she happened to have read the records and saw my name. Surprised, she called everyone she knew in the Korean Canadian community, looking to notify everyone she could. Then, she called my then-homestay mom, who called my mother (who yelled at me for going to the hospital), and she, with her mom, broke into my dorm to find me. I was writing my exam at that time in an exam centre due to a midterm exam. But she kept calling me, as if she was stalking me. I told her that I was busy, but she kept calling and told me she was with her mother (who knew me). I hid in my dorms after the exam but she kept calling and told me she was in the dorms. I had to let them in due to panic, and they were li
ke “how are you doing???” without even explaining why they were even there. They gave me some snacks and things, and they left. My boyfriend at that time was like “what was that?” because they broke into my dorms. I assumed that they wanted me to be okay, but they breached my privacy by calling everyone that she knew and letting my mom know. She completely went against confidentiality. This is why I’m afraid to go to the hospital nowdays because I think people are going to find out and tell everyone. This incident tripled my paranoia to a level that caused me to be unstable when I returned to the hospital after a weekend pass (after my exams)."

I was told this because I cannot differentiate and understand the difference between that and a real life time loop.

174357092,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A comparative study of childhood/adolescent and adult onset schizophrenia: does the neurocognitive and psychosocial outcome differ? _NAME_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Asian journal of psychiatry , May 2019 20 The present study aimed to evaluate the neurocognitive functioning and psychosocial outcome (in terms of social functioning, disability and internalized _USER_ID_) in patients with schizophrenia with childhood/adolescent onset (age of onset ?18 years) and adult onset (>18years) schizophrenia and to evaluate the effect of neurocognitive impairment on the outcome variables in patients with youth and adult onset schizophrenia.34 patients with youth onset schizophrenia (Group-I) and 56 patients with adult onset schizophrenia (Group-II), who were currently in clinical remission were assessed on a comprehensive neurocognitive battery,Positive and Negative syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS),Socia
l and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFS) and Internalised _USER_ID_ of Mental Illness Scale (ISMIS).On neurocognitive domains (after adjusting for co-variates) significant differences were noted between the two groups in terms of processing speed (TMT-A; I?>?II; p-value -0.009), verbal fluency (COWA;I??II; p -0.031). Compared to patients with adult onset schizophrenia, patients with childhood & adolescent onset schizophrenia had significantly higher PANSS negative score, higher disability in all domains of IDEAS, poorer socio-occupational functioning, low global functioning and reported more _USER_ID_ in the domains of alienation and discrimination.In patients with childhood & adolescent onset schizophrenia, higher deficits in the processing speed and verbal fluency were associated with significantly lower socio-occupational functioning and higher disability; higher executive dysfunction was associated with higher internalized _USER_ID_. Among patients with adult onset schizophrenia, higher disa
bility was related to executive dysfunction only and higher _USER_ID_ was associated with poor cognitive processing, selective attention and poor executive functioning.The present study suggests that compared to adult onset schizophrenia, patients with childhood & adolescent onset schizophrenia have more deficits in neurocognition, have higher level of disability, poorer socio-occupational functioning and have higher level of self-_USER_ID_."

176059689,"I like to give homeless people a few bucks every now and then. I’ve been doing it for years and though I am a little wary sometimes I have had few issues while doing it. I mean I see an obviously homeless person and I either walk up to them or they ask me. It’s a simple, quick, uncomplicated process. But about a month ago, a woman at _NAME_-in-the Box fouled things up. I was at the drive-thru and ordering and she walks up and asks if I could buy her a chicken sandwich. She looked pretty ragged and I had a BOGO coupon so I said sure. Buy in a small way she messed up my usual routine. I had to wait in line and everything was going OK but women on the street have to be more careful than guys in my opinion. I drove up to the window and I realized she was really cute. I didn’t want nothing weird going on so I dismissed the thought. But just for a split second, she picked up on it and she looked like she was just going to leave. Then I didn’t want to seem like I wanted anything from her so I supp
ressed the thought. She walked up to the window and asked the guy about the chicken sandwich. Then she walked away. A second later I got my food and the sandwich. I drove to the parking lot and a homeless guy asked me if I could spare a dollar. But now, I just sensed that with two people at once that this could cause some unwanted drama. I gave the guy the buck and he complimented me on my car. But the woman says, why did you give that as*hole a dollar? I answered because he needed it and.she just snorted in disgust and walked off. WTH? I usually give pretty indiscriminately but now that woman planted a seed of doubt. Do I judge the next homeless person I see? Do I interview them to see if they are nice people or at least a little nice? I guess it boils down to that I might be giving money to as*holes and bad people. I wish that woman had never said that."

In principle, I don’t agree with socialism, but perhaps it will last long enough where I can benefit from it. Instead of voting for Republican, maybe I should just not vote at all, stay out of politics, ignore my dad, and ride the wave no matter where it goes. Maybe this whole progressive thing isn’t that bad lol. I’m like a second or third class citizen because of schizophrenia. Only good thing is I can blend in.

I probably would have been in it, but I withdrew and hadn’t talked to him in 8 years before that. now we hang out every month. I think I’ve recently lost the cynical viewpoint by realizing I was just a good time and not much of a friend either. it can be hard for people to deal with someone who is having issues and many of them will just cut you off. I know now that some of them weren’t great friends to begin with, but I don’t hold that against them, we were all young and selfish and didn’t want to deal with real life problems. but like this one friend I have, he’s very supportive and works in mental health, even has some sz’s in his family. he treats me normally, but is there when I need someone.

If you feel like your manic and depressed at the same time it’s likely that you’re having a mixed episode and you should probably get in touch with you pdoc just in case they want to adjust anything or evaluate you for possible hospitalization depending on your suicidality."

Maybe you should stop reading the news for a bit, as it seems to trigger you. Calm down and try to do something relaxing. Perhaps make some of your graphics, or do some colouring, or do some breathing exercises. I can tell you a few if you want, there’s one in particular that helps me when I’m having an anxiety attack or a meltdown. I know it sucks that you can’t be honest about your schizophrenia, but no matter where you go, someone will always judge you for something. I’m fat, bi, and trans. No matter where I go, one of those things have _USER_ID_ attached to it, and I won’t be able to be completely honest about who I am, for my own safety. But there will also always be people who accept me for who I am regar
dless, and so will there be for you. Especially if you choose to go back to Canada. Sure, you might get judged by a few people. But you’ll also be loved by some people. And you gotta keep focusing on the positive. Focus on the lovers, not the haters. Some people are saying trans and non-straight people should be sterilized and forced into conversion therapy.

The guitar reaches down into your deepest depths and speaks the language that only you can understand. The drums shout your ambitions, and the lyrics speak the emotions that you dont know how to articulate. Rock carries you away. Far away. Away from everything that bothers you. It floats you in space where nothing can touch you. It makes your soul sing and laugh and dance. It excites you in the way that only music can. It excites the soul yet calms it by stripping away all worries. Heh. Well that probably won’t make sense to anybody else but there it is. My appreciation for rock written in nonsense."

174357155,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A Natural Product with High Affinity to Sigma and 5-HT7 Receptors as Novel Therapeutic Drug for Negative and Cognitive Symptoms of Schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neurochemical research , Sep 2019 16 Dehydrocorybulbine (DHCB), an alkaloid from Corydalis yanhusuo. W.T, has been identified as a dopamine receptor antagonist. We extended our assessment of its pharmacological profile and found that DHCB exhibits high to moderate binding affinities to sigma 1 and 2 receptors, serotonin 5-HT7 receptor, and histamine H2 receptors. This led us to evaluate DHCB properties in pharmacological (apomorphine and MK-801) animal models of schizophrenia in mice. The pharmacological profile of DHCB was screened through radioligand receptor binding assays. Single dose of DHCB reversed the locomotor hyperactivity, stereotypy, and prepulse inhibition deficits induced by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. DHCB also reversed the depres
sive-like behavior and memory deficit induced by the glutamatergic antagonist MK-801 in the forced swim and the novel object recognition assays, respectively. These results indicate that DHCB effectively improves schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits that are induced by the disruption of dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. The effectiveness of DHCB in reversing responses that mimic negative and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia might suggest that its anti-schizophrenia effects are mediated through modulating the activities of several receptor particularly sigma 1, sigma 2, 5-HT7 and dopamine receptors. Our study casts DHCB as a promising lead for therapeutic treatment of schizophrenia."

She experimented a bit with pills, and started becoming a bit eccentric, driving on the wrong side of the road and the like, but she was lots of fun to be around. Some years later, I was still feeling like an incel without the hate, and I disobeyed my mother by going to a sex party (disguised as a birthday party) operated by Cuba Solidarity (the real one not the club). I took her along with me. I still don’t know what happened that night. It was like people were disappearing into the ether, perhaps on to some space ship where they performed sex acts on aliens (I’m not talking about Cubans, I just don’t know, perhaps I’m referring to Orishas or jinn).

I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

174357183,"Yes low dopamine function reason for lack of emotion, low motivation and many other things. Its almost like parkinson disease. Parkinson people have low emotions, masked face etc. AP lowers dopamine in brain so it may be one reason but it can also come from many other things like disease itself, low blood circulation to brain etc. This is why previously partial dopamine agonist like abilify helped you with motivation. Dopamine and norephinephrine boosting substances help to bring some emotions and motivation but high chance it also worsen positive symptoms like paranoia especially if on medication. Cdp choline indirectly boosts these in a balanced manner unlike direct ones like wellbutrin, l tyrosine etc so its a suitable option. It also used for parkinson and stroke patients to improve their cognition and motivation. Anyway do consult with your doctor before trying anything. Also Cdp choline can worsen depression in some especially if dose is high."

Nowadays I am eating a bit more as I stabilized and I also take probiotics which help with gut bacteria. If you are at a big caloric deficit like me, it is very hard to exercise because you have no energy. The best way technically is to eat a bit more like maybe 1700 and also do 30 minutes of cardio with weight training. For a 195 pound man, 1400 calories is extremely little.

I was running around with kitchen knives, trying to kill my little brother, because of the voices. I had unusual thoughts, beliefs. I definitely needed help. My parents to this day think there’s nothing wrong with me. Or they’re in denial. I keep telling them I seem normal on medication. Without meds, I’d be a paranoid mess. Oh I didn’t mention. When I was in high school my parents use to blame drugs on my behavior. I never touched any drugs."
176059960,That’s awesome!
176059961,You have broken it down completely what I’m going through
176059962,I don’t want to take antipsychotics anymore either but I’m terrified of the alternative so I’m staying on them as long as I live.
176059963,Yes its dose dependant like risperidone
174357181,"“Unfair” is schizophrenia’s middle name. I try not to dwell on it. Instead, I think of puppies, playboy bunnies, and huge servings of Rocky Road ice cream."
176059964,my gym is closed now so I cannot go swimming anymore. They sent me an email saying that they want me to continue to pay the fee. I don’t think I can afford it
176059965,My pdoc knew that Invega was very bad for me and still put me on risperidone.
176059966,I’m not schizophrenic and my brain is fried. It’s the meds.
176059967,There is always something you can aim for it could be improving your diet managing on a lower dose of meds exercise education or self help it could even be little things like being able to keep your house tidy and chores done learning new things to cook seeing friends or enjoying the little things in life like the weather. I hope things get better for you and you are given the life that you deserve hang in there and keep hope that destiny will bring you great things.
176059968,"You are not a guy, _AT_MENTION_?"
176059969,Put away phone/computer. Close your eyes. Try to find harmony.
176059970,cool i will consider your advise
176059971,Just something more for my daughter She’s 3 hours away. I might mail it But my parents go there a lot So I can send it with them.
176059972,Absolutely that’s the way. I focus on gratitude
176059973,Someone on my family gets paranoid sometimes - he talks every now and then of satanists and witches and family members’ curses. I hate it when he talks of those things to me because it feeds my delusions. Just like what happened with my mother all those years ago in my teens and how she spoke of demons and tried to get me exorcised. How my first delusions I developed was that evil spirits would infiltrate my mind. Now this talk of witches and satanists is a real trigger to me. It’s enough dealing with _PERSON_ without having to worry about evil curses and spells on me.
176059974,Aww thanks that means a lot to me. Yes hearing just be yourself from others does help though. It’s not always easy but hearing it as words of encouragement is nice. I know right. I don’t just want to be a disease. If I can help it that is So ill try again tomorrow. Thankyou again
176059975,Hey _AT_MENTION_ glad to hear your arm is on the mend
176059976,"_AT_MENTION_ . _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ … hope ya’lll doing well!!!"
176059977,I’ve done most of my Christmas shopping. I will get the rest at the end of this month.
176059978,You have all the future to learn to love yourself and realize you’re worthy of love. Hang in there. Never say never!
174357193,"ok, ok I’ll go get my mammogram. Jeeze."
176059979,yes for me in the early stages of my voices it seemed like they struggled to be speak in a way where I didn’t think of what they would say before they said it and struggled to sound make some voices like female voices or male or when they imitate voices and stuff and now its been 12 years and they are complete rational smart voices
176059980,Bleh just crying
176059981,this fantastic i love it.
176059982,I think at one time I was at I think 30 or 40mg a day at the beginning but for the most part I was on 20
176059983,i like it =3 151515
176059984,It sounds like anxiety Try not to dwell on it
176059985,The funny thing is I confused a mustard seed with a sesame seed
176059986,"So I am doing really well. Volunteering, dating, going to school full time, but I can’t get over the anxiety that I am going to relapse. I have been relapse free for 2 years but I can’t get it out of my head. I want to work full time and move out but I feel like it is never going to happen."
176059987,"I’m not sure if my parents are supportive or not. I’m feeling alone about it. Some people warned me that maybe my parents manipulate me, but, I wonder, why? I’m aware that I suffered a lot of emotional, psychological and even physical abuses during my childhood, but I still have the hope they will change. This hope may seem innocent, but it’s killing me. It seems that I can try everything and they will never be happy, especially my father. When I want to talk to someone, neither my father and my neither mother want to talk to me. They generally avoid me, especially my mother. My father goes watch TV or Netflix and my mother takes the phone and calls someone (generally my sister or her friends). And I have this mixed feelings because I really love them. I want them to be happy too, but it’s difficult because it’s not my responsibility to make them happy and neither to be their parents (it would be twisted roles). And sometimes my parents gets reactive to me when I talk about polemic stuf
f like religion, politics and some other stuff. I do my best to not push any agenda. When I try to talk about the abusive things they do and did to me, they keep quiet or get reactive. No one likes when we talk about our parents this way. It seems everybody had a nice childhood with their own parents and they can’t relate with my situation. I had a girlfriend who had abusive parents and she would vent about them to me and I would listen carefully. Why don’t people do it too? I feel really sad. I feel broke inside. I feel there’s no way out from this loneliness. I wish I had one person who would listen carefully to me."
176059988,Sz will often confuse things. It’s nice to touch base with others who are just humans. I’m sorry you’ve missed out on a lot but keep looking forward. I didn’t get diagnosed till I was 29. Boy did I waste a lot of years trying to be normal… It sux but you move forward. Tomorrow is a better day. How are your friends going where you are. I know you lost a good one a while ago…how are you fitting in and what’s your current living circumstance?
176059989,Last time when I got assessed by pip I kind of got the feeling they had quotas to meet.
176059990,"Big silver lining is I finally stopped trying to “jut out” my shoulders, and my posture is less stiff, or robotic. Still feel like my arms dangle, and whenever I approach a door handle I feel like I’m in between steps, though, lol."

176059993,"I completely agree. Whatever works, right?"
176059994,i have intrusive thoughts or internal voices about police wanting to harass me a lot. after some of the riots in usa where people were rioting because cops were shooting people is when it started i think. sometimes i think they are going to come to my home and shoot me.
176059995,I think I’m mentally free.
174357194,How would get prescribed AP’s anyway without a Schizophrenic diagnosis?
176059997,I have house lone remaining in INR equal to $15000. It cut $154 per month from my salary.
176059998,"_PERSON_ I have a therapist, I just talk about what ever is on my mind and cant get anything through about my meds, its like she cuts me off and doesn’t tell the doctor. it takes a toll on him and he drinks, which totally upsets me. I cant deal with it. It’s not fair to him though cause last night I held onto him until I fell asleep because I couldn’t even focus or say anything right. These episodes suck, they really hinder our relationship, hes only one person, and he needs coping skills too"

176060000,My vjayjay is perfect. Is that better?
176060001,Yo it’s so Ill I dunno what _NAME_ it samples??
176060002,"I agree with _NAME_. Eating only once a day is not a good strategy. You should eat at least twice a day, or have up to six small meals. I get up around 7 a.m. so I have three meals a day, plus one mid-afternoon snack. Some say it boosts your metabolism to eat more times, so they have six mini-meals. I used to have two meals a day when I was on Haldol and used to sleep so much. I had a brunch and a dinner. It might be a good idea to consult with a dietitian to see what they would suggest for you. Also, try tracking your calories if you don’t do that already. I always thought my diet “wasn’t that bad,” but when I started tracking, I could see that I was really eating over my healthy ranges. Good luck!"
176060003,"I think risperidone is the only antipsychotic I don’t have experience with, but if your nurse practitioner wants you to do this it is probably okay. Be careful, though. Learn to recognize your danger signs. One time when I had come off my antipsychotic medication I had a whole town ready to kill me."
176060004,"just wondering how the normies do it, they might show signs of having problems but they don’t take meds I guess once you get a diagnosis you’re stuck on these meds."
176060005,Your dead right lol. Commenting voices been sending me a bit loony lately - thought everyone was smiling at me cos they could see my angel wings. Im not kidding. My Depot jab is due this thursday - and im praying the shrink approves the dose increase for this week - so i dont have to go downhill again in the last week of the 4 weeks on 100 and wait another month. Im coping so long as im staying indoors - but its a right challange even going to the shop at the moment for the milk and eggs. Asked _NAME_ for another home visit to have the jab done.
176060006,"Just wondering if there are any service dog handlers on here? I would love to have a psychiatric service dog but I don’t think I have enough time to put into training a puppy from the start and I definitely don’t have the funds available to purchase a already trained service dog. Maybe one day though, I can hope right?"
176060007,"At my grandfathers cabin at the lake. He has a few bottles in the fridge. Him and his girlfriend rarely drink and control themself when they do. Down the hill at home we don’t keep any alcohol. It’s easier on me knowing it’s not in the house. _PERSON_ doesn’t like to drink at all, and my mother will rarely have a glass of wine with dinner. I prefer to stay away. So I’m here clutching my phone, on the forum, until I’m no longer alone. Trying to turn a craving with one of my life lines."
176060008,"Why are you taking the class? Sometimes for me it helps to drill down on the reasons I’m doing things in order to shore up the motivation. You could also break it down into smaller pieces and reward yourself for each part you accomplish. I’d be happy to “trade a task” with you, like _AT_MENTION_ does. I’ll do something I need to do, if you do something you need to do."
176060009,"Yes, they have. It’s like they’ve adapted to my meds. Before I was put on medication, I wrote many theoretical physics articles. I’m not a physicist, but I was so engulfed with it I came up with some remarkable theories. But! Unfortunately I don’t understand any of it now. The math makes no sense. The notes are all jumbled up. It’s strange how my voices have made me seem “smart” as I counciled with them."
176060010,have you tried you tube’s “insomnia sleep meditation calming an over active mind” It’s pretty good.
176060011,"I started taking Vraylar a week ago and my mean voice is panicking saying over and over, “Somebody help me!!!” It feels good I can put this mean voice into a panic for what he’s done to me even if he’s not real."
176060012,Hang in there buddy. Are you on any meds that are supposed to help with voices?
176060013,"Thanku _PERSON_!!! I will try as much as I can to stay in that calorie limit Likewise to you, best of luck"
176060014,You gonna be alright?
176060015,"I’m sorry that you feel the same way. You shouldn’t feel that way- you are loved. On the other hand, I should have never been born. My life is a mistake."
176060016,I do a lot of mass building exercises but not clean and jerk. My rep range is 4-6 so probably close to what powerlifters do when they aren’t maxing out. For some reason that range gives me near continuous progress I use _NAME_s Heavy Duty principles.
176060017,Ofc its possible. I had female friends who were single and I was single.
174357202,"mine seems more linked to depression… My spontaneity improves quite a bit after taking Prozac and/or a good night of sleep… It helps for me to break things down into smaller tasks on paper or in an app… Today I had to think through and write out all the steps of sending out a condolence card for a friend who lost his wife. I was surprised at how complex it is. I didn’t finish sending it yet but now I have a plan for doing it in pieces a little at a time. It really is hard for me to keep all the steps of doing seemingly simple things in my head. I am now much better at shopping for groceries but cooking, laundry and cleaning sometimes still confuse me and I still have trouble doing these automatically. I have a pretty good routine of feeding our cat every morning though so I am glad I can manage that chore pretty well. A lot of it can be a fear of making a mistake too. I rarely cook poultry or beef because I am afraid of doing it wrong and making myself or someone else sick. I get really str
essed in driving through areas I have never been through before."
176060018,"It was very good before my SZ. She introduced me to her parents. We went to her parent’s house. She wanted kids by stopping her contraceptive pills but I stopped her because I was only 20 y.o. and I didn’t feel good about my future. She was 25. I started to feel sick back then and distanced from her because of social isolation. Eventually I tried suicide to stop the voices and I ended up in the hospital for 6 months. She was mad, I didn’t tell her that I have SZ. She texted me if I was dead."
176060019,How you doing with addiction(?) _AT_MENTION_

176060030,"Adrenaline comes from cortisol, a stress hormone and too much of it is very bad and can even cause heart attack in some. Other effects include insomnia, muscle wasting, anxiety, paranoia etc. There are many activities which can raise adrenaline. A safe and useful activity is exercise and workouts. Many drugs also raise adrenaline levels like L tyrosine, wellbutrin etc and there is norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors too like atomoxetine (strattera) which is used for treating ADHD."

174357216,I hope so. I don’t want a lot of questions. I am not open about my diagnosis. If they press me I will probably say PTSD and that’s only a white lie. No way I am saying schizophrenic

176060062,When I’ve been ill I’ve had positives. In between I’ve had negatives. Negatives have gone away now except I don’t have focus to read like I used to. Are your negatives under control and what type of ones did you have and did u find anything helped?

Ive been on this injection for 4 years and ive been pretty happy with it except the constant negative symptoms like hard to hold a train of thought while speaking and lack of emotions and just slow thinking n replying while talkin oh and social ANXIETY. Did it help in that area for u or did u never have a problem with it?

I prefer 4.5mg, but when my Psych Doc changed it to 6 I listened to her(didn’t feel to swift) I am currently on 4.5mg I have hardly any positives and the ones I have are manageable. There are some negatives but better than anything else I have ever been on. Therapy has helped me with motivation and anhedonia is almost completely gone. If you do switch or already have I would recommend exercise for many reasons including negatives! At least this is what works for me and I like Vraylar a lot! I understand some people react poorly to it but that does not include me and I have had many psychotic breaks, but none on Vraylar yet, and it has been a little over 3 years. Good luck to anyone who try’s it."

Secondly, I can see how deeply this has affected you. I’m proud of you for not burying this to deal with some other time, or never. That’s important! It’s important to say what kind of person a bully is. It’s usually someone who is insecure, thinks poorly of himself, even alone. Thanks for sharing your story with me.

Still finding it hard to accept illness but I talked about the time span before I went into hospital first with someone and they said it wasnt normal but I didnt think there was anything wrong with me. What do you think? Originally I had this old lady in my community and she came into my home supposedly trying to help me. I thought she was spying on me with the community and getting them to follow me and poison my food. Also my neighbor never opened his curtains and it made me scared. Then I had a flatmate who always offered to make me food. I didnt trust him and my house was also a pig stye I had old nappies lying around everywhere. This all was happening while I was high functioning at university and looking after a 2 year old child and a 3 bedroom home. I just thought it was stress but could it of been a sign of illness not that I really believe it. I’m trying to investigate and come to terms to what is really going on
176060084,"I have cogentin prescribed for restlessness if I need it but it makes me feel weird so I hardly ever take it. You could try a benadryl, that’s pretty harmless and might make you feel better."
176060085,"I have a love/hate relationship with anti-depressants. There’s a fine line between depression and mania for me. So I get enough medicine to pull me out of the depression and I teeter on the edge of mania. I’ve spent a lot of time hypo-manic, which is fine but precarious. It just doesn’t take much to go too far. Right now I’m taking 30 mg of cymbalta and it’s actually doing pretty good. It took awhile to work though. I’ve gone manic from prozac and zoloft and it wasn’t pleasant. I’ve had to stop taking many other anti-depressants for racing thoughts and trouble sleeping and a few just simply didn’t work on my depression."
176060086,I dont have this problem but my problem is that simetimes I say or laugh inappropriately and then feel bad about it after. I think it happens bcz I have apathy and low empathy.
176060087,"It seems that it depends if you use the greek name or the latin name, you get 666 on one and 616 on the other. The fact that some manuscripts used 616 thus seems to prove the interpretation of _PERSON_."
176060088,"Here is an example. After thw riots, my family volunteered to do trash pickup for the city. We were in high crime areas. People were honking and waving and cheering because they saw us with the garbage bags. But once we used up our bags, I started feeling unsafe. Because suddenly we were just 3 light skinned people in a predominately black neighborhood. The people did not change, and we did not change. But I felt a bit uneasy on the walk back to the car. But I still walked back because I knew it was unfair."
176060089,This is my nightmare. I can’t cope without APs and antidepressants. I’d relapse hard and fast. It would honestly be so so terrifying.

176060148,^ I agree with that. The more you try to stop thinking about something the more you’re training your brain to make it a struggle.

176060214,If you play the game properly you’ll find that a good shrink will get a handle of you and your symptoms. It’s not an exact science. It really is an art for prescribers and if your not giving them the information they need they might not be as efficient. It’s a complex game with medications and efficiency of medications. You seem pretty well together which is cool.

176060271,"My grandmother is not my biological grandmother. She married my grandfather before I was born. She has Alzheimer’s and I live with her. My cousin and I take care of her. My entire life she never wanted anything to do with her biological family. I’m 44 years old. In the 17 years I lived here I’ve only seen her biological niece twice. My grandmother had a will written before she got sick 2 years ago. She’s leaving everything (entire estate) to my mom aunt and I. Her niece showed up one day and dragged her to a lawyer. My grandmother is mad that her niece isn’t getting anything. My mom and aunt have dual power of attorney. My grandmother turned against me. She was listening in on my phone calls with her niece. I’m wondering if the phone calls were recorded. One call in particular I told my aunt I had $10,000 saved. I also told her I wasn’t paying rent and I was worried the human services would find out. My grandmother is going around telling people I don’t pay rent. Which isn’t total
ly true. I paid up until covid hit in March. I gave her the money and she wanted to go to the casino so I took her. She’s 80 years old and I didn’t want to deny her having fun. I just wanted to make her happy. After she quit going to the casino I quit giving her money in September. She was hiding money and I couldn’t find it so I quit giving it to her. I’m worried her niece record the call with my aunt and is going to try and get me in trouble. I said a lot of stuff in that phone call. Not everything that would have been recorded is true. I was lying to my aunt about having $10k because I wanted her to think I would walk out of here. I wanted her to do something about my grandmothers niece. Am I being paranoid? Her niece is evil and vindictive. I don’t put anything past her. My aunt got my grandmothers other niece in trouble. Now I think she’s trying to do the same to me. Can recorded phone calls be used against me? I have a letter from my grandmothers doctor written a month ago saying she’s in 
capable of making her own decisions. Her niece is coming tomorrow and I’m worried she gonna take her to human services to tell them I don’t pay rent."

Someone to validate your beliefs. Someone to say “well, you don’t fully believe it…it’s fine”. You always say: “well it’s only a half-hearted belief”. But you continue to make posts on the subject.

Suddenly you have to now be a player in the real world. Gotta go get a career now because your capable, so thats now normie stressors. Your head now feels empty because the voices or delusions dont occupy there space anymore. Then maybe that feeling of uniqueness even though it was not a good thing is now gone too. so there would be a huge adjustment period to going from disabled to fully functional I think. I know when my voices went away for the first time I actually felt anxiety after a llittle while because it was so quiet and I kept wondering where they went."
176060312,"Some things that I find helpful include meditation, listening to music, walking, drawing, reading and believe it or not cleaning the house! Meditation is actually a lot easier than most people think that it is. Try something as simple as Headspace.com or TenPercent both are available on Google and Apple Apps. Meditation is the selective direction of your attention. Sometimes an amount as small as five minutes can make or break your day once your get into it. And really all it takes is a little determination to make it a habit. (21 days). As far as music goes listening to music in the background that is set at 428megahertz is the most comforting for anxiety and 528 for positive mood and getting you up off your rump without banging a beat that can be annoying after awhile. Try reading something educational that doesn’t cause emotional mood swings at night before bed and above all turn off that TV. Wallking a simple ten minutes in the morning and again at night is enough to get your aerobic exercise 
in without over exhurtion. Drawing can help you to organize your thoughts and is especially helpful in helping you to remember your dreams and lists if done near that time. And cleaning the house helps you stay organized. We all feel better when we are organized and it reduces the level of stress that you experience by as much as 40% according to some experts."

I really like living in supported housing as I’ve always got company and the staff are nice too. I receive £1300 a month is disability benefits. I have all my housing costs paid by benefits. I pay no council tax. I pay nothing towards the 21 hours one-to-one support I get a week from social services. Out of my £1300 a month disability benefits my outgoings are really low. I can keep all my outgoings under £400 a month including all my bills and food shopping. I have quite a good life, I went of three holidays abroad last year and have paid for two holidays early this year, planning two more at end of year."

176060321,Thanks _AT_MENTION_!
176060322,You hold the hammer tight I can feel with dreaded anticipation Crashing deep into my chest My glass soul Crumbling into a million Shards of pain I came for answers Like you were a guru Or a god Pleading with you To hear with my thoughts My face Where my tongue Couldn’t move In the right direction Mumbling in frustration Your eyes I don’t know if they Carry sympathy Or hold back scorn. I fall silent and walk away The Never ending journey Of desiring to be heard Respected. I walk out the door Suitcase propelling me forward I won’t return I know now that There is nothing more to do My heart is complacent But my soul burns The shards of glass Beginning to gather And form With each piece into a picture They don’t need to understand I will walk this journey On my own.

I totally bought into the natural remedies, and was meticulous about what I put in my body. thought the meds were poison from big pharma and that I didn’t need them. each time my symptoms raged out of control and I was admitted. now im on court ordered meds, because if I wasn’t I probably wouldn’t take them. preferring my physical health over my mental health is usually why I stop taking them. im sza. a pdoc may accuse me of getting manic. which I think is a little ????????. im a natural creation and just happen to have a lot of energy and time on my hands. so I often will take long hikes, or hitch hike, or take trips seeing the country, and that is what gets me thrown in there. im not near as adventurous as I used to be. just want my normalcy."

176060360,"I have a negative experience with BPD. My brother in law is finally moving, but it’s taking some time to move all his crap out. But now that he’s been called out on his bull$#@&, he thinks my husband is the A#$hole. For being honest to him. He’s p oed because he thinks constant complaining is acceptable behavior. He believes you should do as he does and be like him. He’s also very judgemental and shallow. I know for a fact that he feels lonely and hates to feel abandoned. But if he was really afraid why does he push people away? Why not try and learn that his treatment of people is unhealthy? I cant understand this. It frustrates me because I wish he would change, but we’ve been told by his dad and everyone else, he’s destined to be alone and to just leave him. Why is BPD such a horrid disorder? I mean him being alone is the reason my husband let him live with us in the first place. And yet he doesn’t realize this. He’s so ungrateful. He’s also a moocher, which is what I told my h

174357301,"Sounds like you’re really stressed out. A lot of the symptoms you’re having could be contributed to that. Do you come from a religious family? That would explain the feeling of being a “sinner”. Don’t worry about being or not being schizophrenic, Its far too early to tell and not really likely. Make an appointment to see your family doctor, They may be able to treat you or send you to a psychiatrist."

176060384,"I am on 3mg but have paranoia when going outside my home shopping with my mother. I got scared of ppl there and even here on the forum, I felt they were stealing my intelligence.

174357303,"My sister and my brother in law tried not to let their oldest son play with guns. They gave up when he started to nibble his _NAME_ crackers into the shape of a gun.

176060389,"That could have been me, I have a bad heart. I still deserved the times I got an ass full of Haldol and a trip to the quiet room. I couldn’t help my behaviour at the time because of my illness, but the least I can do is _USER_ID_ and take ownership my actions. The mentally ill are – for the most part – being treated better now than at any other point in the history of mankind. Doesn’t seem to stop some of us from whining like little kids, however. You’d be better served by taking the energy you put into complaining about everything and focusing it on recovery."

176060391,It’s only recently occurred to me how bad it really was when I was aged about 13 I miss read A single social Cue When I first walked into my first classroom on the first day and made a decision not to talk to anybody and I don’t think I did for about two and a half years apart from The necessary passing cooperation in class I was totally isolated and this was at a boarding school I was fat I was bullied I had the wrong clothes spent all my time on my own either with Bulimia or with dancing on my own or hiding or self harming or stealing to extremes Prior to 13 I did stupid things like pretend I had a sprained ankle all the time at school and my sense of humour and my lack of social skills were off I don’t know where the line is between bullying and paranoia All feels a bit pending schizophrenia

176060399,"Yeah you’re right. Just to be more specific though, I should mention that these thoughts/voices never sound like they’re happening around me, they’re only ever directly in my mind. This is what makes it confusing for me sometimes."
176060400,"I sought to immediately rejoin my job once I thought my head had cleared. I worked that job on injured knees and still kept a strong work ethic but after my psychotic break my stamina was drained. My own brother told me I haven’t earned anything in my life and I had to leave that situation for a healthier one. I don’t know what he expected of me, I doubt he did any research into my illness."
176060401,"It’s for people suffering from anxiety and agoraphobia. It means to “face your fears” more or less and “expose” yourself to things you wouldn’t normally do. I.e going outside, going to group therapy etc."
176060402,"I get the same seasonal fluctuations, the “crash” I get are psychotic breaks, and then it takes forever to recover from the cognitive effects and thrown off sleep schedule. Psychotic symptoms come and go, some are triggered, others just come out of the blue. My eating habits affect my mood as well, and intake of caffeine."

176060425,Programming helped me pass the time in the hospital. I was looking forward to every free moment I had to code. It feels like you aren’t stuck when you are moving forward on something you’re creating. Also making music can help. Or just talking to the people in there.

176060432,"I just realized something a minute ago. I had a coin collection that I started when I was in sixth grade. Through all my many moves I still kept the coin collection. I was reading an article online about how certain coins in your pocket could be worth a lot of money. The article made me realize that in the last private home I lived in, I left my coin collection there. When I moved in they let me store three boxes in a shed. I left on bad terms and I got only one box back. It just dawned on me what was in the missing boxes. I had two complete sets of all those state quarters that came out around 1978-82. I also had a collection of pennies, some from like the 1920’s and 1930’s. I had several “proof” sets of coins including the entire set of coins that commemorated the bi-centennial way back in 1976. I had other coins too that might have been valuable. I got asked to leave from that house in 2015 and I had completely forgot that I owned those coins until literally five minutes ago. I can’t g

When I take clozapine in recommended dosage, I can’t ejaculate and when I do I hardly get any semen out. That’s very frustrating and if I ever wanted to have kids some day, I think I couldn’t because of low amount of semen. Do you guys have similar problems? Is there any supplement or med that can fix this ? Of course , I will talk about this problem with my psychiatrist but I just wanted to see your opinion. Which antipsychotics are best for ejaculation disorder and which antipsychotics are the worst for ejaculation? Best regards… P.S. Sorry for my English, it’s not my native language."

174357325,"achieving remarkable accuracy of 91.69% with a decision-level fusion. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A Multi-Domain Connectome Convolutional Neural Network for Identifying Schizophrenia from EEG Connectivity Patterns. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics , Sep 2019 13 We exploit altered patterns in brain functional connectivity as features for automatic discriminative analysis of neuropsychiatric patients. Deep learning methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a single type of connectivity measure.We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived brain connectome in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of effective connect
ivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of 1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions using different fusion strategies. We also consider an extension to dynamic brain connectivity using the recurrent neural networks.Hierarchical latent representations learned by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveal apparent group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform traditional support vector machine classifiers. The MDC-CNN with combined connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of 91.69% with a decision-level fusion.The proposed MDC-CNN by integrating information from diverse brain connectivity descr
iptors is able to accurately discriminate SZ from HC.The new framework is potentially useful for developing diagnostic tools for SZ and other disorders."

174357317,I don’t know what I have. I think I have disorganized schizophrenia (recent theory) combined with Asperger’s Syndrome. I think I’ve met a lot of crappy doctors that lie and are ill-equipped to deal with me and are paid to spew non-sense. I think I was in MK-Ultra so my mind is broken and I ended up with autistic and schizophrenic symptoms but then possibly aliens or adult trauma caused MPD/DID symptoms too. Just my own concocted theory of mine. They say only childhood trauma can cause DID/MPD which I deny and don’t think happened and don’t remember but then again I can only remember stuff past 21 years old. I’m 30 years old now. It’s possible aliens/Illuminati stuff happened to me as a child. I think aliens have been possibly abducting me/interferring with my life since I was a kid.

I mean, how much of the fantasy genre is heavily formatted after _PERSON_s world? How much classic literature is about a forbidden love?

174357330,Welcome to the forum. Don’t know for others but I can’t do without meds.

176060510,I’m a bit that way too. I don’t think I am entirely but certainly that way enclined. I don’t believe I have superiors. My x in sa is the best leader in the world and I would do as he says mostly if I agree but not if it stops me from being true to myself such as he doesn’t believe in climate change and didn’t want me vegan and I couldn’t let him be the boss over me when it came to that. Some leaders are haters and that is not my truth. Love is my truth. I believe people misuse power and suppress others and put others down to make them selves feel better. I have a manager at volunteer work and she knows what needs to be done and I don’t so she tells me what needs to be done and I say yes or no but she is not my superior.i love her but I don’t believe I’m beneath her. My mum thinks most people want a leader telling them what to do and she is a bit disgusted by that. My x in sa is the best leader as he doesn’t talk down at people he is directing and brings out the best in them. Mayb
e I should be a anarchist more than I am. I’m definitely a bit that way and any leadership is to be done cool and not talking down at and they are not superior. My x is right winged and I’m not. No I’m not much for all of that. Some people have disgusting behaviour they think they have power and misuse it and hate a lot etc I can’t explain how I believe but I’m definitely not believing in superiors no matter how they suppress me or put me down or scare me it’s not my belief.
176060511,"I often dream about demons they try to scare me and talk about all kinds of stuff. Like one was telling me that it was good that there is somebody who is fighting that tyrannical god, meaning the devil. But this one time. They were screaming Cerna on Thursday! Cerna on Thursday!

Sure enough, I looked who was playing on Thursday and I see _PERSON_. Can’t explain this I didn’t know they were playing on Thursday. Maybe just chance. There is some paranormal ???? in this world.

How did this happen It will easily be a substitute for proper supports and effect people who are in poverty, areas with no supports etc etc etc It makes me think I am not important to my country. For years I would have qualified for and option and may have done it if it was in effect. but I got treatment supports and meds and eventually doing so much better - even though I struggle every day I am important.

176060570,"Based off of your replies in this thread I believe it is a delusion. I used to think the government was after me. I would think they were watching me, or they were trying to poison me, or that they were simply going to charge in and take me away. These all started a few years ago and absolutely nothing has happened since it started. If the government were after me wouldnt they have gotten me by now? If the government were after you shouldn’t they have gotten you by now? I know governments really suck sometimes but I also believe that if they really wanted to get me it would be done within a few days. I think the same goes for you.

174357340,"hiya, i'm _NAME_. i've had schizophrenia for almost 6 years and recently i have tried plant based eating as a way to reduce hallucinations. About a week ago I started a juice fast, drinking 6 glasses of juice a day and since then i have done a coffee enema (which actually ruptured a blood vessel, so i had to get checked out at hospital, so not sure whether i should recommend it, but it DID clear out my bowels) and i am also eating 100% plant based food. My auditory hallucinations are still detectable, but they are mostly muffled and so I can't hear what they are saying. Also I was feeling depressed and scared and remembered that healthy oils are meant to be good for stress (or something like that) so I had some avocado and peanuts and felt relaxed instantly. I have also been taking 500mg - 1.5g of Niacin (vitamin B3) a day, which is also working better than usual. (have had almost no sound at all from the voices) And also, also I had coffee yesterday and today which did not make me hallucinate like 
crazy as it used to. So since then I have been taught the basics of salsa dancing from my flatmate and even got back in to my old hobby of drawing. :slight_smile: Maybe plant based eating could help you. :)"

I said I want you for my nurse every week. She laughed the silliest laugh. Normally I wait for a long time. More than 30 minutes, one time an hour. I complained to the other nurse. Well today my regular nurse was all ready for me and I only waited for about 10 minutes. I wonder if the other nurse said something."
176060693,I am very apathetic. But I think it’s because of the APs I take.
176060694,"I completely understand. I’m just nervous to try it on the phone. There’s a group 20 minutes away, but I’m nervous about leaving the house."
176060695,"Even better, I bet if you think about it, your symptoms might have been better. I do very little exercise but when I do I find that at least I think better."
176060696,"I think this condition isn’t understood well. But, I do believe that it is one problem with three facets."

176060699,"Dang. Honestly, I would eat **** (lol) if it meant making me feel better. Haha"
176060700,"I haven’t been to the mental hospital since 2017. Last year I had a depressive spell that almost sent me back, but my nurse practitioner prescribed me an antidepressant that leveled me out enough to keep me out of the hospital. Sometimes I get the feeling I should go back, just to get my meds adjusted in a safe environment, but overall I think I’m fairly stable these days and can probably have those changes made on an outpatient basis. For now anyway, lol."
174357385,My recovery process from schizophrenia was finally looking good until the ugly witch menopause cast her wicked spell now I have a bad cold to top it all I also have itchy sore red eye lids
176060701,I’m sorry you feel so bad. I hope you find some peace somehow
176060702,This discussion thread is definitely making me count my blessings. Also a good motivator for staying on my meds.
176060703,"Probably not. The human mind tends to focus in on a particular detail or feature of what we see, where as the camera sees everything exactly as it is, without influence Not sure if that’s what you meant?"
176060704,"Is this because no one responded to your other post about the scars? Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Not every thread is popular."
174357370,"I believe I was in the secret space program as a milab and super soldier and it all started there at university. But this isn’t my first life. It’s like my trillionth and I keep resurrecting back in time in my time loop so it doesn’t really much matter anymore. So I’m not hounding or bitter. I’m adjusted and I’ve lived countless other lives, but I’m still dealing and struggling and healing and feeling tortured and disabled a lot. I have a lot of blame to go around and questions still un answered and hurt. Maybe if this ???? never happened, I wouldn’t have gotten schizophrenia at all. Maybe I was born into this SSP milab super soldier ????. It seemed to have happened at college. Monarch programming = Operatin Greenstar. Makes sense fake military craft abduction combined with a milab operation and mk ultra mind control programming that resulted in schizoaffective disorder and disability. Can’t really say anything about it. I guess I feel better that I dropped out going to a tough sc
hool, in a tough major, having a psychotic break, and smoking pot. I did post the mars, aliens, and other stuff on facebook and time travel around that time it all happened. The whole thing with Operation Greenstar is they send you back in time a few minutes before they took you (they kidnapped me from my room in my cooperative). I guess this whole _NAME_ (many world’s theory of quantum mechanics) and their technology is different because I’m in the same timeline I guess. I don’t know how time travel works. Wouldn’t it have created a paradox? So this all did happen and there is evidence… I don’t get anything besides SSI. I never got an adequate apology or explanation from the school or government (military I guess), and I don’t get money or benefits. There’s a few others like me that I found out on YouTube and the internet that are like me. I took a break from that book I was reading because it said there’s a documented 40k monarch victims in america and up to 2 million of them (not sure whe
n it was last updated). No way I can sue or get money. There’s not enough to go around. Why take me and ruin my life in the middle of college? It’s like I was meant to drop out and have my life ruined. F*ck that sh!t. I can’t really say I’m a military guy or a veteran because I am not. I never signed up or anything. And I don’t want to be. But it’s interesting. I just want to be left alone. Sometimes I just want help and to be believed. Is that too much to ask?"
176060705,When do you see your pdoc next? You have some kinks that need to be worked out that they should be able to help you with.
176060706,If there’s an afterlife I’m gonna spend it partying. But that’s like 50 years off for me so I don’t give it much thought.

176060722,"Wanting to do it is different from actually making real plans to do it. I think of torturing old friends from 4 years ago but have never made a move to make it happen. If that’s your situation, it’s ok."
176060723,I had never heard this before but my father said it today. It’s wordplay I guess but could delusional thinking have some comparisons? As though we are stuck in a wordplay? Just scratching at something bc I think he said it for me even though my mom was also in the room.
176060724,"I’m glad you’ve made it this far, I was unaware that medicare would last for 8 years, that’s really encouraging."
176060725,"You could also go to the ER, from there they will transfer you over to a psych hospital."

Wendan decoction (WDD) is one of the classical Chinese herb formulas used for psychotic symptoms.

When WDD + antipsychotic was compared to antipsychotic alone, the combination group had better global state and mental 
state, fewer people with extra-pyramidal symptoms, and reduction of the mean use of risperidone. There was no effect on weight gain. There are no noticable side effects either. It’s just herbs. So affordable too, like $25 shipped for a month. The name you can find it under is “_NAME_.”This is an indispensable part of my regimen. Even if it works well, don’t get off your APs.

176060731,It’s just a testament to how very quiet the early mornings are here. In my last house all I could here was the sound of the cars on the freeway. It was terrible.
176060732,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, I have been on 500 mg Metformin for years but the doc today upped it to 1000 mg so we’ll see. Thanks."
174357382,"Just quitting seems stupid. If even i, the girl who hates meds, says that, it really is stupid. It just earns you an ambulance ride to the ward. If you are lucky. For me, changing my diet and being more active (walking) changes my situation a lot…I got a lot more energy and motivation when i started to eat healthily. I thought i had negative symptoms and found out they were partly a result of junkfood. If you really want to lower your meds, make a careful plan. Discuss it with your psych, learn to regulate your emotions and thoughts better (cbt?), see if they carefully want to work with you to find out if a lower dose is possible. And: start with small steps to change things, even if they say no. Im sure you can do it."
176060733,When I went off Paxil it felt like I had the flu for 2 weeks. I even tapered and everything. I had been on it for years. Hope you start to feel better soon _AT_MENTION_.

176060738,I don’t want to take mine either.
174357390,I can hide my delusions ok but if I hear voices it’s difficult to hide it because I start talking back to them and pacing and my face goes into expression of distress and sometimes I cry. And I can’t look people in eye when im psychotic as I’m scared they’d see my madness and my thoughts

176060748,What makes attention so desirable to you?
174357393,Do you have SNAP? I’m able to afford pretty good food on that like boxes of cherries or strawberries or whatever is in season. And fruits aren’t cheap in Hawaii at all… the mini fridge in your room is a good idea. I find some camomile or sleepytime tea at night or coffee in the morning is a good investment. Caffeine curbs your appetite! L theanine can calm you down from positive symptoms. It helped make me feel better. Don’t be afraid to go to the emergency room to demand attention or let your doctor know you’re having breakthrough symptoms. Hope they go away soon and you feel better.
176060749,I wish you all the best. I truly hope it doesn’t drag out. Do you have someone to support you while you wait for the response?
174357395,"Hello, I am considering starting to take Abilify, but I wanted to know how common it is to experience erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, or delayed/retrograde ejaculation or anorgasmia. Anyone experience these side effects, and if so, at what dosage? Also talk about other medications you take with Abilify or if Abilify effects your sleep or mood depending on dosage if you want."
176060750,"Other side of the coin, caring about others success, and not caring of your lack of it.

176060761,Sz will complicate things like sex. It’s usually a pretty normal thing but sz will make it more emphasized or more important that it really is. That is just from my experience. It can be a side effect of the meds but don’t change meds till you’ve had sex would be my idea on things. Sex with a partner will in a lot of cases cure most problems. In the meantime work on simple things like relationships with your choice of partner. Yeah it’s hard if your unemployed but if your young have a go! Nothing to lose and plenty to gain.

What are the odds or chances? Has this been studied? Is is possible I’m misdiagnosed or I got a worse case of bipolar disorder? In my whole 9+ years of illness, I never had physical or visual hallucinations, but had hypnogogic hallucinations a few years back when really stressed out (mild sounds while falling alseep) on low dose risperdal or no meds at all while living with my dad. Thoughts? I don’t hallucinate. I believe I have trauma because my first psychologist said I had acute stress disorder (I think he diagnosed me) and then said the Monsters were making me sick (I know, I should quit them). Then my delusions are turning out to be less delusional and crazy and more true but still out there. Like I believe in aliens, ufos, time travel, simulation theory, conspiracy theories, cloning, transhumanism, etc. Thoughts? I ta
ke meds and will continue to take Vraylar. I just don’t know how to cope without energy drinks. My life is missing without them. I feel like if I quit, it would be startling and completely life altering since I’ve been on them so long and so much over the years. I’m like mentally and genetically wired and altered differently now. I still have no motivation or drive or energy. I’m not really depressed, but my doctor said the psychological aspect of my illness could cause no motivation. I also read bipolar patients with severe trauma can show no motivation, so there’s that. I have planning and executive problems and cognitive issues but that can be bipolar too. I’ve never had a severe thought disorder or none I can think of either. I can still drive and stuff but I limit it. I can talk and speak and look and act normally. I just dress disheveled and have poor hygiene. I feel the doctors are lazy and crappy and ill - equipped to diagnose me correctly. Any opinions or help with regards to this? The tr
eatment is the same, but I feel like I got the short end of the stick like a lot of guys in my situation. I’ve been hospitalized a lot."

176060806,The memory of wen I was normal is slowly beginning to fade. I have vague memories it’s mostly about difference in energy and connection to the world.

The main purpose of this study was to follow up a group of persons who, fifteen years ago were considered to be fully recovered from schizophrenia, in order to examine how many have sustained their recovery and to investigate the role of resilience..."
176060808,I hope there’s no brain damage too. Probably not. Way to go in recovering 95 percent. What do you do with you spare time?
174357415,I had a depressive break at 23 but with hindsight I was pretty paranoid even back then. I also had some issues with ocd and racing thoughts. I think it’s pretty common for sz to have depression as well.
176060809,"Trust me i know the feeling. This how overcome it. Med change or med increase. Its brain imbalance in reality everything is okay. The mind make your hell or heaven in instance. Everything is going to be okay. Its only a strong feeling. Its going to hard to overcome. To me while to over my feeling something bad is going to happen, had to increase med change trust your fine, the world is fine. Talk to your psychiatrist immediately this not joke if you feel bad seek medical help. Your deserve feel happy and positive not negative."
176060810,Western medicine medicalises our issues and drugs them. Other cultures nurture people with psychotic illnesses and have better prognosis than we do with our science. I wouldn’t be so quick to dismiss a spiritual explanation. Taking pills to tranquillise people into normality is hardly a solid fix when people around the world without access to meds seem to recover…
176060811,"I still have some suspiciousness about other people’s intent, but overall I have no pressing delusions."
176060812,It always ascerbates how quickly you get it each time you stop meds…very dangerous…sometimes things happen to schizophrenics when they are delusional and they end up hurting themselves badly or worse…please stay on your meds…and work diligently with your psychiatrist about getting the balance you need if you are unsatisfied with your meds.

I will be getting testosterone injections, but I have to wait till the MRI comes back."
174357414,"You’re not weird. You may not be fully diagnosed yet but you don’t sound weird or extremely different from others. I have schizoaffective and I dont have mania, although I had one dr see my paranoia and anxiety and he called that mania. My current dr doesn’t think I have mania. But I’m still diagnosed schizoaffective, depressive type as I do have problems with depression. So I relate to you. I don’t think you’re weird at all."
176060816,Hey you spent ten years in reality and then a bit in surreality. Don’t let the dx define you. Most of your time you are normal. Maybe you could find something to occupy your time. When you’re busy you don’t think abt stuff like that

174357419,"I think a reality is there is no perfect solution. I would imagine that the label ‘schizophrenia’ is broad. You cannot ‘show me schizophrenia’… an AP works for someone and they live a normal life. Others are crippled by side effects of APs. If APs work for you, great. Thats really good. But dont turn into a nazi and say APs are the BEST solution for ALL people. I think meds are good but this site really comes down hard on people who realize we do not have all the answers yet. Psychiatry is young people. (Random rant, flag if you want for being off topic. just venting)"

If a person talks about themselves and you are not interested in them, that’s your loss. You would be interested in a friend’s self talk, right? Or have you never loved another?"
176060835,"I took olanzapine as a PRN for years. but then as a regular med it made me become delusional and I didn’t realize that it was the med making me worse. I tried stopping it but I ended up after a couple days taking it again. sort of trading one set of symptoms for another. I ended up going to the ER after 2 months of this awful experience, this doctor didn’t know me and I explained my diagnosis history of symptoms and how zyprexa was making me worse. he told me to forget zyprexa and gave me a script for 3mg invega, I felt better within a couple days. no tapering process, just a direct switch."

176060846,"hello it’s been a while. I cut ties with my two close friends do to some weird reasons. so the two girls i talked about in my last post. i finally was done with all the drama and ghosting. I am rather confused still, but my therapist said i need to get them out of my life, so i did. i blocked them and cut the ties with them. Do i have a lot of questions as to why they did what they did, yes. i am tried of all the bs going on and getting yelled at for my emotions. Let me start this off. okay my so called friends wouldn’t message me for about 3 months. i also have been having physicals issues with my meds. so i stopped taking them do to seizures at night. okay fast forward a week. i had a delusion my friends were hurt. so i messaged both of them. not spam them or anything, just messaged them once a day. and no message back form ether of them. was i worried for a week. cuz the feeling that the delusion had over me and made me feel guilty that my friends might be dead, yes. finally after getting a 
message after two weeks of just me sending a message a day out of worry. i got told to stop that i am being annoying, if i didn’t I’d be blocked. Fun fact they blocked me! yes i was grateful i got a message, but also felt like i was wrong to do so. i felt like i was coming off as a burden. fast forward a month and crying my eyes out. my friend _USER_ID_ (not real name.) messaged me her phone number. so I called her up right then and there. to see if she was alright or needed anything. She answers and i asked her what in the world was going on or if she needed anything. she tells me that she been dealing with her abusive mother as well a drug dealer her mom in with. when i tried reaching her an my other friend they were hiding form them in a closest. and had to block and not awesner me. (for an entire two weeks Now That Seems Fishy!?) she apologized and said she had to go. _USER_ID_ has the same disorder that i do (schzioafftive disorder depressed type.) btw and _NAME_ has not had a diagnosis in quite a wh
ile. what really bothers me is they both think they have supernatural powers and have prepressed me into believing it as well. as in they believe they are physics and a higher being as well. i told them i don’t want to be apart of it. yes they respected that, but i know form experience someone will use that against them. i tried to tell them it’s not real, but they don’t listen. oh well no help with that now. the reason why i am worried is that i had the same issues lasted for 7 years. men and women alike have tried to trick me to date me. just so i could get more information on my imagery friend. yes i had an imagery friend the same time i met my friends that we are talking about. i grew out of it. yes my imagery friend pops up form time to time, but he is here to help me cope and understand my emotions better. they on the other hand have them two, but think they are spirits or ghosts sent here to protect them. they trick me when i first started showed sighs of schizoafftive disorder. they said he is h
ere to protect me. yeah he here to help me cope form the scares of people like you have given me. i fell for every lie and trick they pulled on me. they made me feel parodied and abused me. _NAME_ my other friend raped me and would pressured me to be possessed, by her so called ghost boyfriend. having low self esteem i complied out of fear of getting yelled at or hurt. she do things to me with out my consent. every when i was at school she pressure me in the girls bathroom or in the locker room after gym class. she wait out side my class room during the end of school. and i complied with it. i went with it, cuz i was alone. i thought it was normal to be abused. i thought it was normal to be raped. i thought it was normal to feel guilty and feel like ???? if i said no. _USER_ID_ denies i got raped, by the same girl she now lives with. She gaslight me and made me have a mental crisis. i felt like i was in the wrong. i felt like my memories were fake. that maybe i made it all up. and even now i question, if my e
motions and trauma is invalid at times. at times with how people make me feel as thought i am wrong. i felt like i was a danger. just last week i almost sighed myself up to a physics word. i thought i was a danger to others. _USER_ID_ said my behavior is out of control and i should just stop. right after she tore into me with sharp words and making me feel guilty. making me question what i have experienced was real or not. i felt like my life was real all with in an incent. i started to question that i shouldn’t killed myself back in 2012 then, if everything i experienced was a lie. _USER_ID_ said i was the manipulating one that i need to stop. stop and look at my behavior. i apologize and said i am off my meds do the helth problems they were giving me. and _USER_ID_ said well thats not fair to _NAME_. ""you should have let her know that you were off your meds, _NAME_. That seems very manipulating of you to not tell her. (how can i when i am blocked though?) side note. I seen my friend _NAME_ at my work and 
i approached her to see how she was doing, but before i could even ask she starts yelling at me in aggressive and loud manner and my friend comes over and asked if we need to get a manager. i just walked away crying thinking i did something wrong, or that i was being a burden. i told my therapist just this and she told me to cut ties with them. i did so and i am feeling way better this week. now i don’t really feel sorry for them. i needed to vent this out rather then going back to toxic friendships and expecting change. they won’t change. i know so over 10 years of the same behavior is a sigh of that. thank you for reading this."

The last 14 years i have only had one 5 day long hospitalsation cause of a breakdown caused by harassment from a colleague."
176060882,"It might sound silly, but one of the things that has really reduced my anxiety was the realisation that it’s okay to get scared. Before, when I felt an anxiety attack coming on, I’d react with “ oh no, I’m getting scared, I can’t be scared, what if someone sees, omg, stop being scared, what do I do, what do I do ” and I’d freak myself out until I was really scared of being scared. Then, I discovered that instead, I could think “ Okay, I’m scared now. That’s okay. So what if someone sees? It’s okay to be scared, it will pass ” Remember that the feeling is temporary, and it’s okay to have it. Don’t panic trying to get it to go away as quickly as possible. Allow yourself to feel those feelings, and tell yourself it’s okay to have them."

176060915,"Solipsism might be legit, but the article doesn’t convince me either way and I don’t have interest in reading it. I believe we live in a matrix, but I think you’re a lot like me. Maybe there’s some truth to our thoughts, but it’s not necessarily beneficial to us to think or obsess about it unless we win that Nobel Prize or move on and learn and recover from it. If we truly live in the Matrix, it’s a brain in the vat sort of thing, and thus solipsism is true, but then it wouldn’t be simply 1 or none “real” conscious beings. It would be like a video game like WoW or more acurately the SIMS where some people are NPCs (no consciousness) and people like me and perhaps you with consciousness. It gets complicated given the size and scope of the universe and reality, but I don’t know. I hear things like we conquered the galaxy and theres aliens everywhere in the SSP and then I been a part of this and listen to testimony but then I realize and believe we might live in the matrix – unle

Then you got pzombies or philosophical zombies which I encourage you to look up if interested. If you cannot tell if it’s affecting you, it might be a lack of insight. Most people can work and still think about such things occassionally while at cocktail parties and then move on and enjoy and live life. Apparently, me and you cannot.

Where do sz hearts go? Do we accept a life less than and just recede into the night? I’d like to believe in reincarnation.

But hard to become enlightened thinking you’re a genius. Strange phenomena in everybody’s life. I just have been exposed. Do you feel me??? Words are powerful. Especially the “genius” word. I hate that word. But I believe in it. Synonymous with enlightenment in a way but in a way entirely more narcissistic. I’m not enlightened. When I die I may be. But becoming enlightened is a lifelong process and I think everyone’s capable but I might be crazy. Thanks for helping me brainstorm.

176060998,"Does anyone else get really confused easily? Sometimes I cant form sentences very easily because of it. Explaining my “weird” beliefs is hard because I dont even understand what they are sometimes. I’m dead, yet I’m a walking corpse, no I’m in a dream, no it’s a matrix thing.

176061001,"I will also say that, out of all the forms of creativity on this forum, songs get the least attention in general. This isn’t because people hate music, but because people are frequently on the forum in bed next to partners, or on the bus, or in public areas where they can’t play audio. So they see the song, but then forget to go back and listen to it. Creators who have the best luck are ones who post each song as a separate creativity topic with “song” in the title, because some folks watch out specifically for new songs in the creativity section. It also helps to respond to each comment someone makes on your song after about an hour or two, because then it bumps your song back up to the top of the topics list. And don’t try to pressure people into sharing more than they originally did. For example, if someone replies “Good song!” the best response is “Thanks!” If you reply “What part was your favorite?” then people will feel anxiety over responding, and will be less likely to 
comment on your songs in the future."

I can’t keep spending the kind of money I do on my food budget. _NAME_’s meals are almost $6 each. The fresh fruits and veggies are fine but the pre-packaged food is too expensive and frankly not good for me even if it is vegetarian. So I’ve decided to replace it with beans and rice. A cheaper, healthier alternative. Higher in fiber, fortified, protein packed. I can hear my mom’s voice as I make this decision and it’s funny to me. Mother always knows best."

176061054,"Reduced affect display , sometimes referred to as emotional blunting , is a condition of reduced emotional reactivity in an individual. It manifests as a failure to express feelings (affect display) either verbally or nonverbally, especially when talking about issues that would normally be expected to engage the emotions. Expressive gestures are rare and there is little animation in facial expression or vocal inflection It’s a problem when you have to engage with the outside world. People often think you are either arrogant, cold hearted, lazy og doing drugs."

174357487,"Sadly, my theories are not wrong. Why do I say, sadly. Well that is a long long long story. Yes I am self taught. I went to a pathetic 1 year training course to become an electronics technician. It was a complete joke. What I do know about electronics, is 100% self taught. I then went for a job interview. But I blew the test. I was almost in tears and I told the guy who was in charge of the test that I blew it and that was that. But he had noticed that I really was trying my best. So, he hired me. At this job, we were repairing TV remote control push button switch devices. This was the old box push button box devices. Anyhow, we only had one channel being broadcast and thus we could only be sure that we had successfully repaired one channel of the switch box. But I took an RF receiver module and made it work in reverse. Now instead of converting multiple channel inputs to one channel output, as the normal receiver module does, it now had one channel in, and converted it into multiple channel output
s. With this device I could now check every channel of the unit that I was repairing. In turn, I was successfully repairing about 60 units a day, while the rest of the crew were only repairing about 20 units a day. This was also due to me creating a tool that allowed me to repair the electrical flex contacts that needed to be un-hooked, re-bent, then cleaned, then popped back into their original position. This tool allowed me to do all 4 functions in just 3 quick sweeps. Anyhow, I was in turn quickly promoted into the quality control department. Soon after that, I was promoted into the test equipment department and was now in charge of all production department test equipment. Not too long after that. I was promoted into the engineering department. Then my boss quit and moved into a different company. Then he hired me and gave me a 57% salary increase. Now I was making more money than were the engineers in the old company. Years later, I started my own test equipment contract company. The first company that I 
worked with was so impressed with my work that they offered me a full time job as an engineer, even though in truth, I was legally listed only as a technician. I came up with ideas that saved them millions of dollars. But then came schizophrenia."

176061132,"Seem to of gone into a mixed state. Sucks ass I felt it creeping up around christmas night. eventually yesterday afternoon I just blew up on someone over a fairly trivial situation, was slamming doors and storming off. All sounds bothering the heck out of me, just very agitated. Then later that night it felt like rage was just simmering below me so I decided to go for a speed walk till I didnt feel like walking anymore. Walked around 12kms in 2hrs During the walk I had major impulse urges/intrusive images to kick mirrors off cars, rip shrubs or small trees out of the ground, just destructive stuff. Kept getting visuals in my head instantly of me doing that stuff. Then some voices kept telling me I was back on the original plan of the physical training to run away from bad people. and that they had more details for me to learn about, then it was just random voices yelling. Then every song I was listening to on my playlist seemed totally directed toward me and designed for me. Like anytime I brought 
my attention to what I was listening to for even 2 seconds it was about me. The logical side of me knows that is just ideas of reference even though it totally feels divine. I hate the rage/agression stuff, frightens me as I am not a violent person at all. and I kept randomly getting tears in my eyes. I had a very traumatic episode involving this sort of thing in 2011. I dont take aps daily, I just use prns. So I took seroquel but it didnt really do much so I took risperidone and that helped slow things down. Still feeling it simmering in me today so I might have to go do another big walk or something and take another prn. Its so discouraging to get these symptoms coming back when I thought I had them beat. It will pass though I know atleast. Cheers, Level"

174357511,"I had severe functioning deficits in lots of areas for all of my teen years, after Psychological Factors and quite persistent very early hallucinations This article is well explained “ Specific psychological models of the mechanisms involved in the onset and maintenance of hallucinations have been examined. However, evidence for these models in children and adolescents is sparse. The cognitive model for positive symptoms of psychosis by _PERSON_ and colleagues40 asserts that higher hallucination severity is associated with higher levels of emotional disturbance, cognitive biases, and negative life events. This has also been found in children and adolescents.41 Cognitive biases such as jumping to conclusions,42 less positive schematic beliefs about self/others,43 and metacognitive beliefs44 are all associated with hallucinations in young populations. Metacognitive beliefs44 were also shown to be associated with unusual perceptions in adolescents from the general population, but more studies are ne
eded to test the metacognitive model for hallucination proneness.45 More recently, social cognitive mechanisms such as impairments in theory-of-mind or mentalizing have been proposed as potentially key in the emergence of hallucinations in children and adolescents.46,47 For example, _PERSON_ et al46 found paranoid delusions but not hallucinations to be associated with hyper-theory-of-mind. However, _PERSON_ and colleagues19 did find deficits in theory-of-mind skills in children with hallucinations. Perhaps the difference in age (and thus developmental stage) between these 2 studies can explain these different findings. The identification of psychological mechanisms that are associated with the emergence and persistence of hallucinations in children and adolescents may inform indicated preventative strategies in the future. “ And after that full blown roughly age 16 I think It’s all a bit of a blur"

classification these cases as a genetic diseases ! This means that,any kind of symptoms can be treated medically whatever the kind of the disease (genetic,viral ,bacterial or insect bites ),but the cure is the core of the question ! The improvement in the severity of the sz symptoms as a result of medical treatment,it does not necessarily mean that there are genetic / chemical roots for schizophrenia ,because this improvement is similar to the improvement in people who have been exposed to the bites of the insects ! In the genetic disease,there is no final cure from the disease ,and the symptoms are coming and disappear only by medication for a while ,and this means that there is no final cure from the symptoms too !"

176061242,"Well, thanks for the response. I respect you for that. I took macro at community college and didn’t learn much. (I knew of micro more back in the day). If what you are saying is true, how come the most successful people and corporations are buying bitcoin if it’s going to fail? It seems right side up to me. If I invest 100, I could lose some of it or all of it. But I could make way more than my initial investment, hence the risk I’m taking and I see it as a low risk investment. That’s true. Governments have historically been the issuer of currency, but isn’t the federal reserve a private entity? Who owns that? I’m not disagreeing. If anything I see government regulation hurting bitcoin to the most extreme of regulation it being outlawed or banned or even a 51% network attack. It wouldn’t cost much to destroy it. Right now, they might allow it, but I don’t see how it could work together unless fundamentals and paradigms change 100+ years from now. In the long run, it will be a compet
itor. One will succeed and the other will falter. Some regulation is good. I think (in my ignorance) that smart, good regulation is needed. Maybe I’m super duper wrong though. Bitcoin is designed to be independent of regulation. It doesn’t really need it. But there are bad actors on both sides. People need to be good people and good shepherds. It’s kind of a weird thing that a decentralized currency is being held in centralized accounts and wallets, which is okay I guess, but runs counter to the currency itself. But maybe some sensible regulation is centralized accounts among other things. I’m not trying to be a hypocrite as I am not really good at technology right now (due to schiz) and I’m sort of lazy, but more of the former…so I have my crypto on an exchange. I don’t really understand it all. I pay a higher fee and everything but get some sense of security but at a risk/cost. (off topic…) I guess if you think your currency (dollar in my case) is at risk of inflation and being devlaued like 
it is now, governments and the elite (fed reserve) might not be always in the best interests of its citizens and might even (probably worse) not know what they hell they are doing at all. (driving off a cliff as they say)."

There are definitely some brands I can’t smoke, at least not without some adjustment, so I am wondering if there is any science behind the manufacture.

174357578,"Ok, so last year in December I was asking y’all for advice on Abilify and the side effects etc. Tried it and…wow I only tried it once and had some weird side effects. I took it in the morning with food, as prescribed, and luckily I tried it on a day i had nothing to do because when I sat down to fold laundry I immediately fell asleep. When I finally was able to wake up (4 hours later), I was massively overheated. My face felt so hot, like when you take a b vitamin complex without food, and I could barely stand without becoming lightheaded amd sweaty. I had to do some chores and all day i was sick and sweaty. It lasted until the next day, the sick, nauseated dizzy and overheated feeling. And I was starting with only 2mg! So, obviously it did not work for me. I haven’t tried new meds in about 5 or 6 years, due to a severe reaction to haldol. What I’ve tried (that I can remember) that did not work at all or i had severe side effects: Zyprexa, Risperidone, Geodon, Latuda, Haldol, Remeron, and n
ow Abilify I finally landed on Seroquel because it kind of worked and didn’t give me horrific side effects (still side effects but tolerable I guess) but it doesn’t do a whole lot besides keep me lucid and sedated. So here are some questions. PDoc suggested either invega or abilify. Abilify sounded like it would be better (more energy, no paranoia or delusions) but apparently my body said nope. So whats invega all about? Pros, cons? But bigger question, what other meds should I give a shot that’s out there? I’m going to take some college classes in the fall and I want to have my meds figured out before then. And I know it’s basically just a crap shoot where you have to keep trying them until you find something that “works”, but I am open to suggestions on what’s worked for you guys!"

I just can’t seem to find my motivation to work but also I do have sciatica real bad where if I’m bent over for a period of time my back and hips kill me. I literally have to stop and lay down on a hard surface to straighten out my back. I’m on meds but they don’t help at all just give me a little bit of energy but that’s it

176061450,"This doesn’t sound right. By the time you can’t hold your bowels, this would be a medical emergency. Lower back pain and sciatica are very common issues that doctors routinely deal with. I would think the doctor would want to evaluate you. Do a physical exam and check range of motion and what movements make the sciatic nerve pain worse, possibly even doing imaging diagnostics such as an MRI. There are nonsurgical treatment options such as physical therapy, back exercises and stretches (they can teach you these in PT), anti-inflammatory meds, etc."

176061471,"I’ve been off and on (on mostly) every different antipsychotic since 2006, and was in biweekly therapy about 50% of that time. I just recently started going back about a month ago. I really have felt like I’ve gotten better the past few years, it’s really few and FAR between that I have major episodes because usually I can shake off coincidences now too. They used to hit me like a sack of bricks, like as soon as my mind would put “clues” together I would feel 19 again and need talking down. But like you said _PERSON_, it’s been a very long time since it’s gone any farther than “Oh s$@#, good thing I’m not freaking out about that haha!” I’m not only slipping back to the dark side lately but devastated that I was wrong about that being over"
176061472,"You can use the search function here to search for “camera” in the sub-forum unusual beliefs, and take note of varied explanations, which presumably cannot all be true. One possible interpretation of feeling that the TV is talking about you, may connected to the way in which in normal people, or everyone, time is out of joint. There is a temporal trick going on. There is quite a lot of research to show that our thoughts come later that we think they do. E.g. The most famous experiments by neurologists find that we think we choose, e.g. to press a right or left hand button, thinking “I’ll press the right one” or “left,” but FMRI analysis of brain activity suggests that we have already made the decision, and only say “right” “left” up to 10 seconds later than the point when we have already unconsciously decided which button to press. There is a lot of research on reasons for doing things being “post hoc” (after the event). When people are effected by outside stimuli, such as 
the placebo effect, they are not aware of it, and think that they have other reasons for their behavior. Concretely, for example if you give people a placebo sugar pill and tell them “this pill will make you feel jittery” (a lie), and then ask them to give themselves electric shocks, people taking the sugar pill will give themselves a higher voltage shock (probably because subconsciously, they can believe it is the pill and not the shocks that are causing them to feel jittery). But when you ask the subjects “why did you give yourself a higher shock”, they say things like, “Ah, that is because I used to make radios as a kid, and got used to getting shocks back then.” And they really believe the reasons that they are giving. Or, in an experiment asking subjects how to tie two pieces of string hanging fro the ceiling together when they are a bit too far apart to reach with arms stretched, where the experiment gives a hint on how to solve the problem (bumping into a pieces of string setting it swaying
) subjects are far more likely to solve the problem (set both pieces of string swinging and catch them when they are closest together), but subjects claim that their reason was not because they were given a hint, but some other reason, e.g. “I thought of monkeys swinging through the trees in the jungle.” So, in general it is claimed, people come up with reasons after they have decided, or been influenced, but people think that they are coming up with their reasons before, and then deciding afterwards. Then… what happens if you start to become aware of this back to front time trick, and start so see how your own thoughts are coming after their causes? E.g. if you are taking part in the experiment I just described, and the experimenter bumped into the piece of string and set it swinging, you might get worried, “how did he know I was thinking about monkeys swinging!?” Or if a normie watches a TV advert where people are enjoying a coffee and then goes to make a coffee, they might think (because they are 
not aware of the influence of the advert) “I feel thirsty, I will go and make a coffee.” But if you start to become aware of the time-reversal, then you might worried, thinking “How did those guys on TV know I wanted to make coffee? They must be watching me somehow!? (They have implanted a camera in my room/head etc.)” Bibliography _PERSON_, _PERSON_, & _NAME_, _PERSON_ (1977).

174357583,I knew i was schizophrenic long before the doctors diagnosed me. Half of one and the other really. The only bonus is when i just had the BPD it was difficult claiming the disabilty as they said it was psychological. Soon as i proved i was Sz - i got the lot without a medical. Ive been on the same drugs for years with both diagnosis really anyway - so its just a paper exercise for me.

I always wondered when I was in there and the other patients started to get out of control the nurses kept threatening patients with a shot or usually do you want another shot and the patients looked terrified of that. I wondered what it was. Anyone know? I figured it was something to make them calm down so I didn’t understand why they wouldn’t want it. I asked a nurse what I had to do to get it and she said be totally out of control. I then said can’t you just say I am and give me one? She didn’t like that I wanted it. I guess nothing to hold over my head. So what exactly is the shot?"

176061489,I guess the short answer is yes. I have less than £500 in my account and have done for the last couple of years and thats with benefits. Living isnt free and I don’t earn.

174357594,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Lithium for schizophrenia: supporting evidence from a 12-year, nationwide health insurance database and from Akt1-deficient mouse and cellular models. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Scientific reports, Jan 2020 20 Accumulating evidence suggests AKT1 and DRD2-AKT-GSK3 signaling involvement in schizophrenia. AKT1 activity is also required for lithium, a GSK3 inhibitor, to modulate mood-related behaviors. Notably, GSK3 inhibitor significantly alleviates behavioral deficits in Akt1-/- female mice, whereas typical/atypical antipsychotics have no effect. In agreement with adjunctive therapy with lithium in treating schizophrenia, our data mining indicated that the average utilization rates of lithium in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2002 to 2013 are 10.9% and 6.63% in inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia, respectively. Given that lithium is commonly used in clinical practice, it is of great interest to evaluate the ef
fect of lithium on alleviating Akt1-related deficits. Taking advantage of Akt1+/- mice to mimic genetic deficiency in patients, behavioral impairments were replicated in female Akt1+/- mice but were alleviated by subchronic lithium treatment for 13 days. Lithium also effectively alleviated the observed reduction in phosphorylated GSK3?/? expression in the brains of Akt1+/- mice. Furthermore, inhibition of Akt expression using an Akt1/2 inhibitor significantly reduced neurite length in P19 cells and primary hippocampal cell cultures, which was also ameliorated by lithium. Collectively, our findings implied the therapeutic potential of lithium and the importance of the AKT1-GSK3 signaling pathway."

I forgot the exact name of what I was injected with, called the nurse to ask, but I got voicemail.

174357627,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Neurocognitive and clinical correlates of insight in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_ and A Mysore, Indian journal of psychiatry, Mar-Apr 2020 Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by various symptom dimensions and neurocognitive deficits. Impairment of insight is a core clinical symptom of the disorder. There has been an increasing focus on neurocognition and insight in schizophrenia; although, many studies fail to control for premorbid cognitive status.Schizophrenia patients (n = 60) selected for adequate background education were recruited from outpatient services of a tertiary care hospital and community care homes in Southern India. These patients were comprehensively assessed using a neurocognitive battery. Clinical assessments were done using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Schedule for the Assessment of Insight-expanded version (SAI-E). Partial correlation was performed to examine the relationship of insight with clinical and 
neurocognitive measures. Statistical significance was set at P = 0.004 (_PERSON_ correction for 12 tests of association). Linear regression analysis was performed to examine the predictors of insight.The mean PANSS positive, negative, general psychopathology, and total scores were 14.2 ± 4.9, 17.4 ± 5.0, 34.3 ± 6.8, and 65.8 ± 13.9, respectively. Mean insight score (SAI-E) was 8.5 ± 2.9. In partial correlation done after controlling for IQ, significant negative correlations were observed between insight score and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) total errors (P = 0.001), WCST perseverative errors (P < 0.001). Insight scores had negative correlations with PANSS negative (P < 0.002) and total scores (P < 0.002). WCST perseverative errors were the primary predictor of insight in the regression analysis.Insight has a strong relationship with executive functioning in schizophrenia. This could indicate shared neurobiological substrates for insight and executive functioning."

176061641,2 1/2 years ago. Don’t miss it but it helped me get better. Put me on the right meds and kept me safe. I didn’t share everything with them though which probably would have helped. Didn’t trust many of them or anyone at the time so I was very very compliant.
176061642,I hear external voices but not internal ones
176061643,"hi chordy. did you ever have someone in your life that tried to bolster your self esteem? try to focus on what he/she said and did for you. i hope this helps. hugs, _NAME_"

176061645,"well my dad says even though theres the crazy, theres a glimmer of gold in there. so dont count it all out. We can think a little differently, more lateral thinking."
176061646,I didn’t appreciate visual art much until I got on instagram and found an artist I really like but I’ve always appreciated music
176061647,I once won 100$ playing blackjack. Best day of my life.
176061648,"Me too, I stopped going to family outtings for the same reason"
176061649,I Was Kidding Yo.
176061650,"That’s because you are a swan perhaps, not a duck"
176061651,That. I get back pain from walking on the treadmill too much. Its also bcz you didn’t walk on it for a long time. Also more inclination causes more backpain.
176061652,"When I was on government assistance, they wouldn’t pay for my meds. I burned through my savings in the two months it took to get on Mr. Star’s insurance."
176061653,It’s a start. Any nice activities you’ve been doing lately? Perhaps that triggered positive feelings?
176061654,"When I heard voices, I would hear them just like with my ears. I could tell what distance and direction they were coming from."
176061655,I feel so sad and tired and like I’m hanging on by a thread. I’m not suicidal. Just want to crawl in bed and never get out. I sleep like crap. I have had major stomach issues for over two months. My knee is so bad I’m in constant pain. I’m just getting more and more despondent.
176061656,"I would meet Ajahn Brahm. He’s a british theoretical phycisist who joined a buddhist monastery and gives talks that are posted on youtube. He’s very calm and seems very wise, and I’d love to have a sit-down with him and just pick his brain."

176061659,You’re not alone Wave. These days I’m afraid of almost anything. I usually have horrible paranoia from 3 to 8. When I first wake up after sleeping 12 hours I’m fine. Then when I take my trazadone at 7 it starts helping with paranoia at about 8. That window is where I’m usually scared of everything. If it’s not one thing it’s the other. I generally think somebody is going to kill me. I’m hoping switching meds helps.
176061660,Im sorry you had a tough day and I hope you enjoyed the burger… tomorrow is a new day !!!
176061661,"There’s many different ways to time travel including backwards in time. The standard physics explanation (I’m a lay person) is you cannot go faster than the speed of light because you would have infinite mass. But you can get extremely close. Think of the speed of light as the cosmic speed limit. Anyways, some people disagree and there are “hacks” or smart aways around it like hyperdrives where you can push space. Space can actually move faster than the speed of light. (Don’t quote me on any of this lol) But you should look into many worlds theory vs standard QM interpretations like Copenhagen. Personally, I often get confused between time traveling like if the universe constantly splits off, am I in a new universe or not? I don’t know. I think it could be possible by now to loop back into the exact same timeline. I’ve heard stories and heard other whistleblowers talk about it. I often consider myself a time travel victim/expert and I’ve done it so much and talked about it so much, 
people often forget because people have the attention span of a gold fish…Plus, it results in insanity sometimes. I’m well aware of all the time travel stuff including ‘Travelers’ on Netflix. I’ve been doing my own research into the various “leaks” into the media to get us used to the concept. My problem is consciousness tranfer back into the same timeline from the future. I really have no idea how it works. I probably have ideas and theories though. I enjoy time travel discussions and other weird stuff. Like I said, I often think I am a real time traveler like I’m stuck in a causal loop or even a time loop. Thank you."
176061662,"Dont be scared, embrace the change for the better. Just think of it like this, your one step closer to making those feelings go away for good!"
176061663,"uhm, your chances of losing everything you’ve gained so far is at stake…please don’t stop your meds !!"
174357645,yeah i know i would quit the meds if i became ill again or just thinking im ok and then relapsing into paranoia and delusions
176061664,i think synchronicity like this could be explained by time maybe not being 100% linear. I’ve not read _NAME_ though
176061665,All the very best _AT_MENTION_
176061666,Thank you so much for your kind words.
176061667,Hope you feel better soon _AT_MENTION_. Please get help if you feel you are going to hurt yourself.

176061670,My brothers once my parents die. That’s what they told me.
176061671,"Hello all, I have started taking Bacopa monnieri and Nardostachys jatamansi for my anxiety and OCD. Been taking these for the past 15 days, don’t know about OCD but my anxiety is manageable now with fewer side effects. I haven’t stopped conventional allopathic medicines as advised by my doc. Let’s see the progress after a month."
174357651,"I officially got my diagnosis today, after years. I have schizoaffective disorder. I’m extremely stressed out, largely because my mom is stressed out about it, and my aunt said “that’s a crazy diagnosis” which does not help. I feel completely misunderstood and alone."

176061682,"OK, _PERSON_…"
176061683,"You are suffering from hostile intrusive thoughts, and you need to suppress these thoughts."
176061684,Idk I think so. Maybe I don’t need second one after all.
176061685,Idk if your shot alone is enough but even if it is you will get withdrawal symptoms by stopping Quetiapine.

176061688,"I only tolerate tea, not coffee. Coffee makes me paranoid. I drink multiple cups of tea with sugar which gives me energy."
176061689,Me too _AT_MENTION_ I’m also terrified of going and my teeth are terrible too. My left upper premolar has now broken off twice and is now a stump. Got two teeth that need to be pulled - one hurting every now and then and it’s at the back of my mouth so I am too afraid to go. Been feeling really hopeless about the situation it’s awful. Good luck with going!

176061690,"Hey, First my response to the first message. My intent btw is not to hurt you, but to discuss our views kindly to broaden both our views. Perhaps we mean the same, but just have a different idea of what malignancy or malice is! Lets take the most extreme example of death. 1.Unintentional death by accident Example: I fall to death, because i didnt understand i cant fly. I am hit by a car because i walked on the road. Dangerous but not malicious. I think we agree. 2.Biological death Example: i fail to eat and drink, thus i die. Dangerous, not malicious. I think we agree. 3.What you call malice, imho can be split in 2: 3a. Violence to self or others from psychosis. Example: I kill the neighbour because i hear a voice that says they only go to heaven if i kill them (intent: benevolent, helping them). Example: I kill the neighbour because i falsely believe they came in to kill me right now (intent: self-defence). I think we agree this CAN be a risk with sz and horribly dangerous. I wouldnt label it as m
alicious though, because the intent is really not evil at all. Just thorougly misguided benevolence or self-defence. 3b. Violence to self or others from malice Example: I kill the neighbour because i enjoy it, their pain and fear gives me pleasure (sadism). Example: I kill the neighbour because i want their money. I know full well it is wrong and harms them, i just dont care (psychopathy, sociopathy, lack of conscience). THIS 3b to me is malignant, malicious. CONCLUSION: I agree 1, 2 and 3a can be part of sz and horrible. But first: I do not think all sz people have these dangers. Someone can also just believe they are jesus and need to hand out purple flyers to everyone to believe in them. Many many sz arent dangerous or violent at all. Second, i do not see these as malignant or malicious. To me 3b is true malignancy and this i feel isnt part of sz at all. It’s a radically different disorder. I do not mean to attack you, just to explain what i mean when i say: sz people arent malignant. What do you think?"
176061691,Congrats on taking theses positive steps.
176061692,Oh man. That’s tough. Try to hang in there and keep trying the meds until you find what works for you.
176061693,i got sz and ASD… so me too
176061694,"It’s not right, you should always feel secure that your meds are covered, it places undue stress on you, and that’s not fair."

176061700,so you have cholesterol issues? then i strongly recommend you to stop or limit coffee as it itself can raise cholesterol. cholesterol reducing drugs like statins carry side effects in the long run like liver damage.

176061705,I begin trial shifts on Tuesday at a cafe bar. It would be full time 4x10hrs shifts. I live in a small town where about 15.000 citizens live. I am just recovering from negatives symptoms and major depression. I dont get benefits so I am fully dependent on my mom. I also feel if i lose this opportunity it will be hard to find another one. I did find this job when I was feeling really good for no reason and i feel a bit down now. My hands sometimes shake when I carry cup of coffee. It is the minimum pay job.
174357661,They say i’ve got schizoaffective. I suffer from low self esteem and depression too.
174357650,I’m happy I grew up without meds. I can’t imagine myself with antipsychotics since childhood. They would screw my childhood

176061710,"“Good thing you’re not _PERSON_.” I’ll take that as a compliment. But the idea is that other people don’t really exist. Rather they are mere projections of myself (or viceversa). If, and only if, the universe is a demonic creation it becomes not only justifiable but morally imperative to put an end to it."
176061711,"Lucky you that your extended family doesn’t know because they definitely treat you differently. Society, especially those in the psychiatric, medical and rehabilitation fields are established for the betterment of people with mental illnesses. Statistically, the outcome for most schizophrenics is poor but there are those who do well with the right support group. Your ranting is okay. That’s why there are forums like this on the Internet."
176061712,That’s a pretty interesting idea _AT_MENTION_ - could definitely be a good strategy to try.
176061713,I like the color in the picture.
174357664,my mom and i call schizophrenia “Schizzy” its cute. a little too cute of a nickname for what it actually is and does to ppl who have it lol
176061714,Ok bro i believe you

174357665,"yes, it is called ‘yoga master’ and it connects to a camera on the ps4 to see how accurately you copy the avatars."
176061716,"Great find _AT_MENTION_! The article distinguishes between treatment-resistant SCZ and other SCZ’s. A difference of "" abnormal glutamate function."" It makes me think of all those small glutamate-based studies which showed promise. A lot of the treatments were later thought to be failures when tested in larger populations. Maybe a lot of glutamate-based treatments worked on treatment-resistant SCZ but failed in larger (more inclusive) SCZ populations. If so it would be time to revisit all those treatments. Hopefully, any glutamate-based treatments which improve cognitive flexibility can help other mental illnesses too. Illnesses where the mind gets fixated, like OCD and perhaps even PTSD."
176061717,Its not fair of her to say that. Im sorry that happened to you.

In that situation I’ll be forced to come out of my “fortress” and face the mobs. By “mobs” I just mean unpleasant, regular people who can’t wait to come mess with and humiliate me. I would have to abide this while suffering a withdrawal symptom that’s been called brain shivers, your brain feels like a flickering light bulb that’s not getting enough power. And, of course, someone from my past will recognize me and come to ask how I’m doing ( so they can report back to everyone else I used to be close to ). And it would happen on Christmas eve, of course. Bah, scumbug! How screwed would you be if a disaster knocked out the pharmacy?"

When I started Lurasidone it didn’t cause me to lose or gain weight and all my blood work remained normal. it had no effect on me at all other than eliminating my psychosis.

176061763,"_PERSON_, therapy has helped me. I have a co-occuring drug dependence and sometimes my psychologist is my only ally.

I still do take my medication but now I’m becoming really homicidal and I believe again that I am Satan. I just KNOW it. I would just like to hear what others with the same diagnose think or if some of you might even have similiar struggles."

174357674,I’ve had moments where I think “maybe this is what it’s like not to have schizophrenia”. The feeling never lasts though. But it would be better if I never had those times. It’s just another item of torture with the disease. Like it’s saying “this is what you could have had”.

That was a big bummer for me because I very much had an interest in science and logic, and now I find I’m having a religious experience that these logical systems request significant proof of to make any head way, and I have to throw up my hands and go…sorry guys I got nothing to add, I’m an unreliable witness in my own life.

176061781,"Thanks for all the well wishes. Things got a little better today. My grandmother wanted to go to the casino so I took her and I won $500. My aunts mad as hell. My mom and aunt are in control of my grandmothers fiances. My aunt said my grandmother should just throw the money on the grill and burn it. My mom said go ahead and take her if it makes her happy. My grandmother is living on borrowed time and the way I see it is if she want to have some fun why not. There may come a time where she’s incapacitated and her money is just going to pile up in the bank. With her alzheimers she could become a vegetable. It’s exactly what happen to my other grandmother that had it. If that happens my aunt is going to have 10’s of thousands of dollars to play with when it’s all over. I just want my grandmother to enjoy herself while she still can. I’m in charge of the credit cards and holy hell did it hit the fan when my grandmother ran out of money. She demanded her cards to get more money. I told her no 
and she had a fit in the casino. I’ll take her as long as it’s within reason. I know her financial situation when she can and when she can’t afford to go. Before my grandmother got Alzheimer’s she racked up $90,000 in cash advances on her credit cards. She paid if off though and is mostly debt free for now. I still feel guilty for taking her though. She played for 6 hours and I just baby sat her most of the time. I don’t know what the future holds for me and sometimes my illness gets the best of me. I told my step dad what I posted yesterday and he told me not to worry about a thing. He said everything is going to be ok just hang in there. He agreed with my mom about taking her to the casino. He said I do enough for everyone and to go have some fun."

Later when I was in 11th grade I took it over my friends house. I lived in an apartment but he lived in a house with a backyard and so we put it there and used to go work out. Later, there was this gated community near us that we used to go in a lot and they had a club with a gym. There was a bunch of free weights in there and one day we stole all their weights and a few bars and put them in my friends backyard so we had plenty of weights."

It’s like she was trying to get rid of me.

176061859,"My empathy levels greatly increased after the crisis that led to my sz diagnosis two and a half years ago. I felt literally connected to every human being on the planet. I envisioned this link as a viscose fluid we all shared. Subsequently I did become a better person with my loved ones, but also riddled with guilt. That being said I’ve always shared the misgivings voiced by tree beard and partly at least for similar reasons. Prior to my illness I had scored very poorly in empathy tests - well below normal levels-- but had a very developed sense of duty and what you might call personal honour. Empathy plays no doubt an important role in our moral life, but if I were to witness someone being saved from drowning I wouldn’t readily conclude that the saviour acted the way he did because he was overcome with empathy but rather because he was driven to do the right and necessary thing. Morality is predicted less on received ideas of merit than on human need."

Was in hospital four times in those three years. Then I went into remission and two years later came off my meds and for five years was med free. Since 2012 when I relapsed I was on meds ever since. I still get episodes but although I still tend to have poor hygiene habits and wear pyjamas and chronic avolition, i only sometimes get depression and hypomania and delusions and voices. I don’t have imaginary friends anymore or write on my walls. I married eight years ago and my husband is still with me.

176061887,"My sister is epileptic and not supposed to drive because her seizures aren’t under control. Someone (was it _AT_MENTION_ ?) was arrested for driving while ON medication, though. You have to be really careful. We’re walking a fine line."

176061889,I don’t know about other causes of erotomania other than schizophrenia and psychotic disorders.
176061890,CBT worked wonders for me.
176061891,It is fried pigs blood.
176061892,I just looked it up. Medicare on average covers approximately $200 of the over $300 per session. I’m not sure what your copay would be. It depends on your Medicare plan
176061893,So he could read your mind then? And for me my head ????? with me it comes up with all sorts of bad things to say about people and just screwed stuff in general
176061894,Pretty much sums it up for me. I’m good for a while and truly believe I’ve beat the illness: then I hit the floor.
174357709,"Yeah as _AT_MENTION_ said, I am also in same boat though I find laughing to myself about something happens more often than a genuine smile. No matter how much I tried I couldn’t show my emotion at my grandpa’s funeral. I don’t know if it is the medicine or what it is but it’s probably just schizophrenia."
176061895,"I think your voice is great. We all underestimate our own voices. I think you can improve most in intensity and rhyme schemes like I liked when you said “I’m on the fence” at the end. It was cool but as you get more experienced you might approach that line differently and say something that comes harder or doesn’t need such a pause. Nevertheless, it was probably my favorite song of mine to date. Just been working on a new one too"
174357717,First: how did you do it? Do you still take medicine? Do you feel “normal” in every way?
176061896,"I think it’s a great place to be able to speak your mind, without being judged for it. That’s worth a lot to me"

176061900,"i think you should do it. Calculating the exact rate at which you will metabolize a month worth of medicine will vary on the person, so yea i guess the smartest way to address that is to get your shot a day or two earlier or later. that being said missing pills is also dangerous so. I think its a good idea because it keeps things stable."
176061901,They supposedly made that up so he would get im trouble.
176061902,you guessed my secret! Now I must eat your brain.
176061903,Yeah. You know your health better than some boss. I agree it’s the right course of action. Hope you relax and get some decent rest in.
176061904,Ninjastar is correct. AP’s help stop the cell loss from psychosis. Psychosis is neurotoxic and leads to neuron death. People who are untreated show shrinking of the brain. Antipsychotics help protect against this.
176061905,I don’t think there is any quick fixes if that is what your asking.
176061906,"I feel like a failure. I don’t work, I don’t want to have kids, I really just wanna sleep all day but I can’t. I did go for a 30 minute walk earlier, but I’ve been so depressed lately. Sorry to be negative. How are y’all today?"

176061910,Change to a better med. you sound a bit psychotic.
176061911,"Hi guy _AT_MENTION_ my voices are just part of me all of them. We have the different sides of ourselves, our imagination and id and ego and superego. Your are very active and I see an introspection in you- looking at it all and trying to figure it out. But stay on the outside in front and let them play behind you. You are just like me and all of us. But as you say grandiose. It must be hard and you need a lot of rest. But you are OK here with us we understand you are OK. Poor guy! Just Hi , and I think you are interesting too ."
176061912,9 or 10 i’m going well
176061913,"It’s a garbage in garbage out situation. When I get stuck in a negative feedback loop with them, they get pissy, then I get pissy, then they get even more pissy, and so on. I’m reading the book Nonviolent Communication. It’s a great book that everyone should read. Helps with lots of social situations. But I’m using it to learn how to talk to the voices, and to learn how to talk to myself (self talk)."

176061915,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant.

Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Volunteer Moderator _PERSON_"
174357718,Did you just try and tell somebody with schizophrenia that they are having delusions? Is that efficient? I wonder if there are better ways to talk to somebody with schizophrenia I’ve tried telling people they are delusional and it’s made things completely worse… Hmmmm…
176061916,If you’re sza bipolar type an AD might throw you into mania without a mood stabilizer. That’s what happens to me. I take Lamictal 150 mg and a very small dose of Zoloft. Without the Lamictal i would get hypomanic really fast.

176061920,"I read a meme that said, “When I wake up my eyebrows are already on my face”. Good thing I don’t wear makeup. When I woke up I’d look like _NAME_ With the streaks of mascara Running down my cheeks Like black rivers Of a darkness that lives Inside. The sparkles from my Eye shadow that I chose Not to wear Would betray the face That I put on so carefully Just that morning As I stepped out of my room To face one more day One more day. Then another. Marching forward Like my feet knew just where to go Which in hindsight Is a good thing Because my mind Had no clue. The brush stroke of the blush That never touched my cheeks Rosy pink I’d rather be the stark pale That truly defines who I am. And I step forward One more time. One more day. Then another. The foundation that covers The wrinkles and lines, The dark patches growing Under my haggard eyes. I can’t hide my age The experiences I’ve lived The hardships worn on my face. The lipstick shining on lips that Have never been touched By it befo
re. No botox here. No puffed up Kissers on this face. Just a wry half smile Being squeezed out By the trembling. And I take that next step. One more day. Then another. And another til I’m grey. No use covering what’s there. I wake up with the pains That tell me About the life I’ve lived To this day. One more day. The last day."

176061924,Personal recovery is more important than clinical recovery they actually needed a research paper to come to that conclusion?
176061925,yes please share this with your pdoc…this doesn’t sound good…I’m sorry you feel this way.

Never been on a date, never held hands, and never kissed a girl. I never had luck on online dating. I’m not attracted to certain women, and that’s okay. I get to pick. I’ve had money. The only girls that ever hit on me were mentally challenged girls or very ugly girls. I guess I’m destined to be alone. I’m 30 years old. My dad isolated me and I tended to focus on school. I am interested in women and sex so I watch porn, I guess. A lot of men do. I’m more logical than emotional sometimes or used to be. I figured I needed money first to get a girlfriend. I was wrong. I see people who are a lot uglier than me have girlfriends. I’m not interested in dating right now at all. I rather wait or get my own place and have some money. I want to lose weight and improve my hygiene. I heard some girls aren’t too concerned with a man’s weig
ht as much as I think. The thing is women like money and I like money too. Basically, I rather have money than a woman and risk losing my money. It’s probably not a popular choice in life. I don’t want kids anymore. I don’t currently have any money. The money I have I spend on energy drinks. I also used to cut my hair really short so I think some women don’t like that and I looked funny. My dad has a small disability trust for me. It’s the only way I’ll survive and not be on the streets. So a woman is the least of my concerns. He’s the only one who has a job or provides me things in my entire family. Everyone else is just emotional and talks but cannot walk the walk so to speak lol."

176061933,"Hrm, it can be a noble thing to worry for others you don’t know. But it obviously is causing you some grief. It wouldn’t help to tell you to not worry about it, I’m not that naive. I say this out of respect and compassion: you can’t help right now. You need to worry about yourself and your own health. People who care as much, and are better capable of handling it are actively working on the problem. Please trust that there are good people who feel like you do, and help. I know it sucks, you want to help. But please Don’t forget about yourself. Actively work twards recovery, and someday when you’re on more stable ground, then you can worry about them, and maybe help. It’s not selfishness, it’s self care."

176061935,"Yeah, I was definitely relying on an old crutch. Funny how they can pull us back in with promises of comfort, much like sirens. I guess I’m tired of life as it is and atm I see no way out, even though I know good things are coming. What started yesterday’s spiral was the sinking feeling that I’ve been irreparably damaged by psychosis. My view of life will never be the same. Any hint of an ability to feel carefree is gone.

176061940,"Being single is a personal choice. Each has its advantage, single or in a relationship. Being single gives you more free time for having fun with your friends and yourself, you stay young mentally and don’t have family responsabilities. Being in a relationship gives you better sex and gives you the opportunity to have kids and feel more grown up."
176061941,Yes. I think we are reaching the maximum efficiency for the second generation antipsychotics and it’s newer refinements that are desperately needed. I’m hoping we will get those tweaks that work well and it’s always something needed for us as a community. Here’s hoping.

176061949,How can you say that? Is a second episode of psychosis under extreme stress enough for that diagnosis even with 5 months off of medication?

I am completely stable on 800mg a day and 50mg of Sertraline."
176061966,Twitch streamers make me think of this video:
176061967,Was the worst thing that I’ve ever decided to do. I became angry and spiteful and did horrible things. It ruined my marriage to a man who didn’t deserve what I did. I regret it. I got no counseling before hand. No one to tell me how it could change me. And now many years later I’m fat again anyway. I’m not saying people shouldn’t do it. Just get counseling before you do. This is not just a physical thing. It’s very mentally and emotionally straining.
176061968,When I played it it was on mute by default. Maybe see if your stream is muted as well?
176061969,I have it happen sometime frequently. But it every so often it happened more often when i had an imagery friend. But now it just when i think of my faincee… i find it uncomfortable and makes me feel a bit unsafe about myself in some ways. Though i am seeing my therapistthis week. so i am going to talk to her about it. And see what she says. I really just didnt know what the hulsanation was called. And to see if anyone else experienced as well.
176061970,"Yes, one of my previous diagnosis was depression with psychotic features"
176061971,Thanks everyone. Update for today is I didn’t drink. Had to white knuckle it for a while. Got better after my family came home and I wasn’t alone. I admitted the urge to them too. I’ll do some research into a virtual program. A weekly check in may be good for me.
176061972,Love it! I bet it was fun.
176061973,Sounds like he had a calling on his life that he filled outstandingly.
176061974,"Don’t give up. Instead of hating yourself for what you did while psychotic, make a commitment to work with your pdoc to get your meds right and make a commitment to always take your meds no matter what. If you do, things will get better over time. I don’t even agree that I have sz, but because everyone is telling me I do, I’m committed to taking my meds even though they don’t make the men following me go away. You can do that too. Just talk to your dr about your depression and your other symptoms and take your meds."
176061975,"I love Taoism too it’s my favorite philosophy. Yes I don’t think anyone has the expectation to be a sage. Especially in modern times today everyone wants to be more than ever.

I don’t need to be the most intelligent, capable or anything in the room anymore thanks to Taoism a great deal. I have a med card.

You may still care about your challenges and be invested in finding ways to overcome them. However, you won’t spend every moment thinking about what’s wrong in your life.”"
176061978,"Hi all, It’s been a while since I posted. I’ve been on the Quetiapine/Seroquel for about 6 months now and I’m slowly making progress. I’ve been in a bit of a slump with depression which theyre struggling to treat as I appear to be SSRI resistent. To try and give me something to focus on I’ve started a Youtube. I really enjoyed making the first video and I have a head full of ideas that I cant wait to get home from work to try rather than wanting to just get in to bed and hide as per the norm. Hopefully this drive to create lasts. I’m completely open about my health on the channel and any mental health questions are more than welcome there. Also there may be a few of you out there that may not of thought about trying to create stuff on youtube as a way of escaping. I suggest you at least give it a go.

176061980,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

176061990,"When I was at college this girl stayed out in the hallway running me down for two semesters. It still makes me mad to think about it. That girl wanted to be a diva so badly, but she didn’t have the right material to work with. One time I got on the elevator with a bunch of girls, and this girl got all bubbly and everything, and I kind of winced, and this other girl looked at me like she was scandalized that I would hurt this girl’s feelings. A lot of the guys on that floor were scathing in the way they talked about her. These days when someone does that to me I offer them the chance to say it to my face. They never do."
176061991,"Well, the worst psychosis I ever had was when I was locked up in jail, and I was completely sober for that time. If weed was the problem I wouldn’t have been freaking out and hearing/seeing/believing wacked out stuff while sober. I’ve never had that level of psychosis ever again, even with occasional smoking. I’ve done it before where it makes me feel very scared, often if it’s too potent, and had to wait for it to settle back down after an hour or two. So whatever that means I guess. Probably best to avoid it, but a small amount doesn’t throw everybody directly into psychosis."

In many cases,why does short-term treatment give good results,while long-term treatment in all cases without exception does not exceed the degree of improvement that induced by short-term,but rather causes serious side effects and the person’s complaint remains persistent ? in other words,why a little time of medication induces an improvement,while long-term of medication gets disease !!"

176061996,I forgot to mention that when I lived in _NAME_. A dentist there told me I needed four crowns. You know how much that is? That’s big $$$. I never went back to that dentist. The dentist out there were notorious for wanting to crown everything. It was all about money. Needless to say in my home state where I currently live no dentist here has ever told me I needed a crown. That was like 14 years ago when that happened. I still currently have no crowns in my mouth.

176062000,"if you’ve tried any, how did they work for you? if none worked for you, what med (even outside this class) did work for you? -Loxapine -Clozapine -Quetiapine -Olanzapine -Asenapine (added/_USER_ID_. thanks _AT_MENTION_) dosage? worsening of symptoms on any one but improvement on a different one? Personally I have an answer/reply for this one to those interested: loxapine: made me extremely fatigued even at very low doses, would sleep for 12 hours or more, would ‘sleep eat’, but not as much so as on olanzapine. The day after taking it I wouldn’t feel rested as I woke up a lot to eat in a confused zombie robot state. And the next day I would start looking for codes using rhymes. olanzapine: use to be an ok med for me at 10mg PRN. but I abused Benedryl (a deleriant class drug with histamine action), and ever since my Benedryl abuse Zyprexa gives me the same uncomfortable body load that 500+ mg of Benedryl would and make me somewhat delusional and very scared by reality, as if after taking it I 
was an alien from a different galaxy, completely frightened by the natural way of life and people. Similar to loxapine in terms of sleep and eating. except worse, I would wake up 20+ times a night, almost in a dissociative state. Clozapine: I’ve been on it twice, the first time for under a month, the second time it was with invega. it made me feel like I could be happy. I never thought about wanting to die. was happier. but because I theorize of having the invega shot with it, it was too much medication and I would get sleep paralysis nightly with scary hallucinations and voices. Quetiapine: This one I’m just trying out now. again it’s with an invega shot that I’m slowly weaning off of (100mg now, next shot is 50mg, every 28 days). I take 150mg at night, so mainly being used for depression at the moment. it helps me sleep well. I wake up feeling more relaxed and calm as well as rested. though some sleep eating occurs. but not much, for example, last night I woke up and ate two apples and then went bac
k to bed. it doesn’t make me worse at this dose. I can’t speak to its nature for psychotic or manic doses (300/450mg+),as I’ve only ever been on 150mg (depression booster dose), and it seems to help for mood quite effectively. I could see myself gaining another 10lbs on it though over a couple of moths. but that’s just speculation. not as bad as loxapine or olanzapine at all. helps negatives at this dose. looking forward to reading what you guys have experienced."

176062024,"_AT_MENTION_ has a point in that countless studies saying a healthy diet cures all ills without dealing with external causes is tiring. Comfort eating when you are depressed can give a temporary boost for a few moments, like a sugar rush for example and you are right excessive anything will always have a opposite low. Eating well is always going to improve the depressed person, but the call to binge out will always be there somewhere if the cause isn’t dealt with at the source. Like me and weed and booze, even though I haven’t smoked in over 18 years; I still have the urge to because I have had a terrible life and until they are all worked through I’ll always want to escape reality."

I hope you can come to terms with it and stop feeling like you do right now. Unfortunately the internet isn’t the best. I wouldn’t have expected that reaction from this forum.

Write down your mood. Then, by tracking all this stuff, you can show your doctor or therapist and they can help advocate for you. They’ll have more too go on than just you trying to refuse meds. They’ll have a basis for suggesting this med or that treatment plan."

176062131,That is to bad you feel that way. Come back soon.
174357773,It’s been my experience. If you have only positive symptoms then you might get lucky with meds. Meds can be quite good at treating positive symptoms sometimes. But having negative symptoms there’s no cure. Unless the new upcoming min-101 med works as advertised. So there’s hope in that at least. For me it’s a bit soul destroying. I don’t really have positive symptoms. But I’ve been pretty much neutralised as a productive member of society.

I didn’t give up work till I was older and I had a great job in retail where I did very well at. I could still, at a pinch, probably give it a go but stress causes problems and that is my issue. For me. It’s important to feel like I’m achieving something too. For me that is volunteering at my cricket club. It very much was an apprenticeship and I have developed skills and knowledge and contacts to actually make it a career…But I’m older and I just love to live as I do now. Maybe in the future. I’d say. What about volunteering doing something totally different to what you’ve been doing? There are other options to get you motivated and confident. Could be worth

I may not aaaalways be able to say it but I’m getting there and have improved. Not as much of a pushover. I have learnt that the best sex does not mean the 
best partner and that the one you love most can be asexual with. I learnt what it feels like to be happy as I was so happy with my x in sa.

I had a girlfriend when I was eighteen and already with schizo affective disorder bi polar type, and we were sexually active. But when we broke up I restrained my desire with morbid religious practices. As a result I have had a very lonely life. I feel I committed the ultimate act of violence against myself. I can’t imagine how cruel I’d be to myself if I’d actually cut my penis off. I have heard of schizophrenic men who have actually done this! I also went off my medicine at this time for awhile.

174357803,"Hi, I’ve been on here before but had to create new account due to new email address. Unfortunately I’ve detoriated badly over last year. I’m very confused and very fearful plus my depression got extremely bad. I have been diagnosed with somataform disorder possibly delusional disorder as well. I feel very strange as in very uncomfortable in my own body and agitated and cant follow steps easily or tidy my house and my own self care has gotten very bad as well. I’m woozy a lot and disoriented, so I do things very clumsy and am awkward with my balance. I feel my physical symptoms have an underlying neurological cause perhaps a rare one but have tested clear for any neurological condition being the cause of my symptoms. My head feels full all the time and I don’t like to leave the house anymore. This whatever I have has affected everything in my life, the very basics it has destroyed. I feel out of it all the time and am always extremely exhausted so I rest a lot and hate having to do anythin
g because I’m so woozy in my head. I am taking effexor 225mg, Queitiapine 300mg, and just again started the abilify 5mg this week, which the docs are probably going to increase to 10mg next week. I have real bad anxiety as well and my breathing is jumping at times like I get caught for breath but it has kind of stopped since starting the abilify again. I’m taking it just four days now and will be reviewed this week by the psychiatrist plus I must attend home based crisis team three days a week. I did all this before but lost the will and heart to keep going there and even stopped taking the abilify and valdoxan at one stage because my head was getting all confused with following the steps and I just gave up because I wasn’t getting any benefit from taking all the different medications but I didn’t give enough time for them to work either I guess. I go from room to room so if I try to do one thing I seem to lose track and start something else so my concentration and focus is really bad as well. I feel 
very jittery. I dont know if I’m suffering some type of schizophrenia. I don’t hear voices but I do sometimes see in my head a steel mask with teeth and saliva, plus racing thoughts . I am very concerned about my illness because I am afraid of it plus hate waking up to it every day. Its soul destroying because it has robbed me of doing things properly and I dont drive anymore or go shopping. Can anyone here relate to this and is this more than somataform disorder I wonder. A junior doc last week mentioned delusional disorder but my other psychiatrists have not. I see different psychiatrists at the clinic but they know my history and so far they all say somataform disorder and depressive illness. Any thoughts I would really appreciate. Due to see doc for review again on Tuesday. Just got one week if 5mg of abilify so dont know if they will increase Tuesday or not. Sorry about the long post and thanks."

176062269,How is your empathy with other people? Do you ever worry about being a bad person? How is your sense of fear and guilt? Sociopaths lack all of these things as well. (Or these are at least diminished) Regardless there’s nothing wrong with being a sociopath so long as you don’t go hurting anyone. Some very successful members of society are sociopaths.

174357804,When I was 18 and suffered my first breakdown I was diagnosed with sza/bipolar/sz and so I read up about it and understood the voices in my head and delusions about evil spirits trying to infiltrate my mind was not normal.

Honestly I’m doing better after finally starting to do the injections instead of taking pills every day.

176062362,"The reason I was posting this is the discussion of gene therapy and how long that might take to develop. Rett syndrome is a known single genetic defect, so the target is known. They’ve been working with turning a copy of the gene back on for a couple of years now in mice. (This paper is actually 10 years old, but the method they used wouldn’t be practical for people, but CRISPR is, and they’ve been using that in mouse models of _PERSON_’s since 2016.) So I think we will get an idea of the timeline to translate that into people. It will probably be pretty big news when they start recruiting for a clinical trial for gene therapy in _PERSON_’s. I think it is very likely that it will be tried in toddlers first. Eventually they may try it in adults. Another disorder to watch for gene therapy is Fragile X. So then we might have an idea of translation times for other neurodevelopmental gene therapies. That might be shortened a bit since it won’t be something they’ve never tried in humans bef

174357821,"I’ve had problems getting to sleep from a young age. To quote my father: _NAME_ and I tended to be rather short of sleep. Because you would not go to bed early, had to have one of us stay with you until you went to sleep and tended to wake up with nightmares. I’m not sure whether it’s related to any cognitive problems I have or not."
176062395,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . I was kind of leaning towards keeping working.
176062396,I avoid flying whenever possible. I refuse to pay that much to be treated that poorly.
176062397,Or talk to your psychiatrist about a dose increase ?
176062398,Are you on medication _NAME_? If you are maybe it needs to be adjusted. I’m concerned you are still hearing voices.
174357826,"Seeking that is hard. Bottom line-there’s little help for adults with _PERSON_’s , let alone those who also have schizophrenia . As a late middled aged person with chronic SMI I’m not at the front of the queue for help and support. I get more help here thanks to my stepdaughter. Also having monthly jabs in my flat allows for more interaction with the nurse, compared to when I went to the depot clinic in Essex. I’ve seen a pdoc once in the 21 months I’ve been here. No therapy has been recommended."

176062401,_AT_MENTION_ Drinking red wine and sleeping pills is so dangerous. Maybe you should go to the hospital. Let us know that you are ok in the morning.
176062402,Same here. That’s the billion dollar question.
176062403,"I’ve been able to function, yes"
176062404,They cannot force you to do anything. It’s only in extreme circumstances that they use treatment orders.
176062405,"Before, you said it calmed those thoughts. Now, you’re saying it increases them. That’s a problem, a dangerous and worrisome shift. How long has this been going on? This isn’t a game, _NAME_. You need to see your pdoc and answer their questions truthfully and fully. You need to tell them everything, especially the stuff you don’t think is relevant, because all of it is. It’s not about convincing people that you’re gravely ill, it’s about being as honest as you can so that you can get the correct diagnosis and treatment before you play around and irreparably destroy your brain."
174357836,"I’ve had therapy before. In the past I’ve had serious issues that I have wanted to deal with, but this time I don’t really want to talk about any of my positive symptoms, just try and leave them in the past. I’ve never tried therapy for negative symptoms, but I really do think, if I could overcome the negative symptoms I’d be less likely to relapse. It’s true, sometimes the triggers are beyond my control, but often I trigger myself through frustration with the negative symptoms. It’s a chicken and egg scenario. I have the negative symptoms because of the positive symptoms, and I have the positive symptoms because of the negative symptoms, at least in part. So I really want to try and focus on the negative symptoms this time around. I’ll have to try and think about how I’m going to convey this. Thank you."
176062406,"From my experience, dont try to be the old you because it may harm you ( stop meds etc…) , you grow older so try to be the best new you."

176062408,But yeah I could look into out door type jobs maybe somehing not offixe based i need to have a think
176062409,Your family sounds cruel. Are they supportive? Do they understand that you have sz and saying things like that are dangerous? Do you think they could be doing it to be mean to you?
174357838,What’s the difference? Both remove our personality. Lobotomy doesn’t cause negative symptoms at the cost of a permanent treatment and anyways they might not find a better treatment even after 100+years.
176062410,I thought I had this or some sort of dissociating because I don’t have a clue about things I done and said when Ill.

176062413,LS! I have/had a problem with seeing ten/fifteen years ago. Often when stressed I saw only black and could see nothing this lasted between a minute and an hour. My psychiatrist was no help in this case.
176062414,They keep reminding me of a time I freaked out in my therapist office and I remember it differently and dont remeber calling her a ????? I wouldn’t do that. They say the voices took me out of my reality and put a stunt double there or something. Same thing happened with my uncle and there was video of me freaking out but I dont remember

176062416,"Indeed. _AT_MENTION_ , I think you just need to listen to your doctor. When I was first figuring out I had psychosis, I asked my therapist about it and pointed out all of the symptoms I had… she completely brushed me off and said I didn’t have psychosis. Then I went to an APRN under an actual psychiatrist and she said I have psychosis without question. I trust the APRN who works directly with the psychiatrist. She knows how to treat people with psychosis and can diagnose it properly."
174357832,"Thank you very much. I think I haven’t started meds yet because of the possible side effects. I’m a person who doesn’t drink, smoke or even take Tylenol so to go from that to serious antipsychotics is scary. I also read that meds really only help with positive symptoms which mine are not too distressing. Voices I hear are like angels or spirit guides so I’m not in fear. But my thoughts get too deep into other worlds and delusions. Thank you again I appreciate all responses. Very shocking thinking I was just a weirdo with anxiety and to find out I’m schizophrenic."

174357834,Thanks for your reply. A couple of weeks ago three times they tried to admit me to hospital but I wanted to be treated as an outpatient because i didnt want to go into hospital so they my psychiatrist said it’s ok after a bit of haggling with him. I feel a bit brighter on the new meds. However i am having those negative thoughts daily. Doc did ask when i get those thoughts and i told him daily most of the time. Someone said it could be delusional disorder so I don’t know. It like you say can take years to be diagnosed I guess. I know though I am not right if you know what i mean. Trying to stay positive anyway. Hope you will get more energy. I was whacked for a year or more. Looking back i was like this 2018 as well meaning I was severely depressed back then as well. So it’s about two years I’ve been going downhill. I’ll see my psychiatrist soon. Take care
176062423,All the time They do small things like that
176062424,Never! You still have plenty of life before you. It’s way too early to throw in the towel.
176062425,Then what happened?
176062426,I’m not sure what you’re trying to say.
176062427,"Not sure, I think so but have been sleeping a lot for years now, before i used to be up late and up early. I live alone so I think I just get bored and lay down, then fall asleep"

176062475,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Differences Between Self-Reported Psychotic Experiences, Clinically Relevant Psychotic Experiences, and Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms in the General Population. _PERSON_, _NAME_, A _PERSON_, PM Pan, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, EC _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, RA _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Purpose: Psychotic experiences in childhood (such as hearing voices or being suspicious) represent an important phenotype for early intervention. However, these experiences can be defined in several ways: self-reported psychotic experiences (SRPE) rely exclusively on the child's report, clinically validated psychotic experiences (CRPE) are based on clinical assessment, and attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) represents a categorization to do with clinical relevance in relation to severity. Very few studies have investigated how these distinctions impact clinical and other domains. The present study aims to compare SRPE, CRPE, and APS among children and adolesce
nts. Methods: This study is part of the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study for Psychiatric Disorders, in which 2,241 individuals aged 6-14 years provided self-ratings of 20 psychotic experiences using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE). A trained psychologist conducted an interview to validate or reject reported experiences and to rate the presence of APS and affective flattening. In parallel, parents provided information about child mental health to an independent interviewer. We tested the association of mutually exclusive categories of non-validated SRPE (nSRPE), clinically validated PE below the threshold for APS (nCRPE), and APS (nSRPE = 33%, nCRPE = 11%, APS = 6%), with parents' information about the child's positive attributes and levels of psychopathology and psychologist assessment of blunted affect. Results: Most associations were qualitatively similar, and there was a dose-response in the strength of associations across categories, such that APS > nCRPE > nSRPE. Experiences in all 
three categories were associated with female sex. nSRPE were associated with overall levels of psychopathology, but to a lesser degree than nCRPE and APS. APS and nCRPE were associated with less positive attributes, with APS more so than nCRPE. Only APS was associated with affective flattening. Conclusions: In children and adolescents, SRPE, CRPE, and APS all index liability for psychopathology, but as clinician rated relevance increases, associations get stronger and become evident across more domains."

I’m on lurasidone, I think they’re in the the same group of atypical ap’s. I feel very enraged a lot of the time and still have psychotic symptoms. The rage makes it hard for me to do my job (I don’t want to yell at a customer or a colleague) & protect my reputation. My main concern with lurasidone is the fear that it will kill me with obesity and diabetes. Since I feel no benefit on lurasidone I am seriously questioning the value in being on it. I really miss a lots of foods that I’ve cut out of my diet to help cholesterol, obesity & diabetes concerns. Food is one of the few pleasures in my life."

176062509,Hi Girl! I’m afraid too. Don’t want anyone reading my thoughts. Today was kind of tough. I have people giving me attention that I don’t want. Someone has a show with people who pick on me. People calling me stupid I don’t want to die. Thinking things I don’t want to. I am not a racist or a pervert. No panic attack today please. Don’t think about it. I was thinking we should go out together someday and try to survive. Take care.

176062515,"I agree with rogueone, substituting one for the other is just putting a band aid on. As many said, you need to look at the bigger picture, you are in therapy for the reasons you smoked pot… I don’t think you talked about moods and coping mechanisms enough to realize what is good for you and not. Give it time, with time you’ll feel better, but substances like that is just giving you like 5 steps back and 1 step up. I understand you wanted immediate relief, but exercise, and other coping mechanisms (tons) give you immediate relief, and not only make your brain better but your body as well. Weed and alcohol are things youvingested. You see what I’m saying?.. if you were to take pictures of flowers/animals, go for walks by yourself, I’m sure the panic and anxiety wont be as bad as when it started, I do take klonopin though bc I feel like something snaps in my perception. Maybe that’s what you were feeling? I’m trying to find better coping for anxiety than taking a klonopin first and then 
do the coping mechanisms. I just want to do the coping cause I feel it will make me stronger. Your situation with weed, when finding the right coping skills, can probably make you feel better. I never did drugs, I even feel shitty with drinking alcohol, so I don’t what its like to enjoy substance abuse, it doesn’t appeal to me."
176062516,It breaks my heart how my friends pull away from me How one day we can be texting like where best of friends And the next I get one word replies It breaks my heart how no one seems to make time for each other anymore And the ice of loneliness covers our hearts make makes us cry out our souls as we break again and again It breaks my heart how someone can be there for you one day And won’t let you be there for them the next As if you were a stranger that wouldn’t understand when you felt like you understood them better than most people It breaks my heart how people can take you from one prison And put you in another But this one is of their device they call the shots Something the prisoner will never do Just like a bird in a cage Just wanting to be free I say all of these things not out of pity but heart brokenness It hurts to look out and see people And know they will never accept me so why even bother I question myself at times Why do I even want out of this cage I’ll just be forced into anoth

No increase in anxiety, and it energizes me instead of makes me tired, so I don’t have to worry about being sedated. It may be that 10 mg is your sweet spot if you get anxious on 7.5 mg. My pdoc is trying to find the lowest effective dose, which is why she’s put me on 7.5 mg. I was very stable on 10 mg and I am thus far on 7.5 too."

Now I am on Latuda since a year and everything is perfect except for the negative symptoms. I found the best time to take these meds is before sleeping because they make me drowsy during the day.

174357874,"I believe, in my perspective, it is an “intersection” of several factors; but, there is something that usually goes along with weight gain and sedentarism, the “metabolic syndrome”. This is my opinion only. This can make you feel that you are “physically arrested”, challenging much more the gravity when you move and uncreasing muscle pain and avoidance to exercise. On the other hand, to exercise, you have to win again the psychological ideation, the negative symptoms, and after that, maybe, there is some reward feeling."
176062545,Welcome to the forum!
176062546,Oh interesting. So do you notice any difference now that you are taking the supplement? How much are you taking?
174357873,I still think I might go to hell it’s pretty annoying since apart from the paranoia I have no other positive symptoms but the hell one is a BIG one to have cos if theres an after life it must be a much larger portion of my existence compared to this earth life which is only 80 years or so. But I’m not sure its just I’m so open minded o can’t help but wonder wat if. If lucky I will just rot away with my physical body or something like that

I think that we spend so much time feeling numb or depressed (or for me it’s enraged/psychotic) that it feels weird & even slightly dangerous to be well. If it’s possible I’d try to cut down on the cigs as the nicotine could over-stimulate the nervous system. but I know that’s easier said than done. I hope your pdoc has some positive feedback for you in your appointment, to me it sounds like you’re doing an awesome job of recovering."

I’m a little overweight maybe 15 or 20lbs and the most I have weighed ever in my life was on invega and that was about 230lbs. Now I weigh around 205. I have a little belly fat and its hard to get back into shape even though last summer I had a regular running and biking routine, running 5kms every two days sometimes followed by a 20min bike ride, I didn’t lose any real weight and my fitness didn’t really improve. I did this for almost 6 months. My sexual health is pretty bad. After starting invega I didn’t have the ability to get an erection, and basically didn’t masturbate for over two years. When I dropped down to 75mg I managed to get an erection again, but most of the time it is too difficult to get an erection to even masturbate. My sex drive is minimal. For a couple years my resting heart rate was pretty high like 85 to 90 bpm but now my resting rate is like 60bpm. As for symptom

(I’m not saying you are, I’m just stating what I’ve heard some family members admit to during group therapy.) They sometimes say things out of anger at the moment, but not necessarily how they feel overall. The family members who generally say things like this are the ones helping loved ones who are not med compliant or who refuse to believe them about having delusions. In the group meetings I’ve been to family members don’t know how to convince their loved ones that their neighbors aren’t spying on them, how there aren’t any cameras or microchips implanted on them, how aliens, demons and religious figures haven’t taken over them or how the government isn’t spying on them etc. I’m sure he loves you, he just might not know what to do to help you. Maybe family therapy could help. It’s hard for people to understand this disease and par

176062581,"From https://www.binauralbeatsfreak.com/spirituality/consciousness-after-death : ""So when I heard about the theory of ORCH-OR, or Orchestrated Objective Reduction, I was intrigued. The theory provides a scientific framework, as yet disproven, that consciousness manifests in living things through quantum microtubules in the brain, and is not a by-product of the brain itself. So what the hell does that mean?! Basically, it means that microtubules in our brains (and the bodies of simple single-cell organisms like paramecium, which exhibit behaviors of consciousness) are acting like antennae for consciousness, and that consciousness is actually a non-local property. So imagine there are little antennas in your brain, receiving signals from an external source, and then the brain processes the signals into thoughts and emotions = consciousness."""

176062589,"The first thing neurotypical doctors do is to discriminate us when we end up in the ER.

My friend’s mom told my friend to stop hanging out with me because I have sz, and said that on a skype call in front of her computer screen. There’s plenty more but I am not going to describe it all. I would like to believe in good of people, but there are people willing to hate me just because of my MI. I try to make it better, but last night the congress made it possible to cancel certificates of mentally ill pharmacists and acupuncturists. There’s no hope in the world which decides to automatically hate neurodivergent and disabled people. I’m going to advocate, of course, to overturn the ableism I face da
ily, but honestly I’m getting tired. I hate that people stare at me because I use a ??????? mobility aid. If people knew that I had a MI, I would lose my job and have a bad reputation. It’s like- I become the worst possible human on this world because I have an MI and a neurodegenerative illness. I don’t know, I’m tired of the _USER_ID_. I’m tired of people’s ableism.

176062688,"Did you ask _PERSON_ what you are supposed to do in this situation? Maybe call just to ask what patients are supposed to do in your situation. Just be polite and ask for advice. I’m sure other people have been in similar situations and ask _PERSON_ what other people do. It’s just asking for advice and nothing else. If they still don’t give you any help maybe just ask them if they know anyone else you can call for help. It may not work but I couldn’t imagine them rejecting such a general question. Call around to pharmacies or clinics near you and see if they have any advice on what other patients do in situations like these. I know this is the last thing you want to hear but in retrospect you and your doctor should have planned ahead of time for your move to make sure this didn’t happen.

I have chips and dip, cookies, fruit roll ups, peanuts, rice crispy treats, chocolates, popcorn, and fruit gushers.

There’s absolutely no understanding with such people that people are far more likely to be good than to be near perfect. For me when ‘identity’/‘ideal use of language’ become dominating factors, and the intolerance of human frailty rises with it , that’s when going full scale into avoidant mode becomes the preferred , self protective thing to do."

Songs about relationships could be interpreted as a human romance or a human’s relationship with God. Many of the artists hiding Christian messages were sporting an Agnostic front. (Like _NAME_ ‘Drop the Pilot’ ) Much later, at the start of the Vietnam War, military psychiatrists were experimenting with the same head-trick started by Christians years before however the second party alarmed the Christian Faiths and so preachers started warning about Satan hiding influence in songs. Enter the 80’s bands like They Might Be Giants and ‘Talking’ Heads came forward making a huge joke the situation as by this time it was a huge mess and filling psychiatrists’ offices. Oh, and let’s not forget the Beatles who introduc

176062731,I think it might have to do with coffee too. ha.
176062732,Have you asked your doctor to try to clarify? I feel I am too stable… I feel my condition is almost “rigid”. I’m sure the doctors appreciate that stability more than I do. -A.
176062733,Pdoc wants me to take 30mg escitalopram for ocd. But im not sure if dose above max doses are safe or will it worsen my qtc interval on ECG test. So i have decided not to increase above approved max doses. Any thoughts ?
176062734,Do you know the serenity prayer??? I know the feeling other people can do no wrong though it’s frustrating
176062735,The first time I went full blown psychotic I got strapped to metal nude in jail. I think I was only strapped for 1-2 hrs if not less. They then put me in a padded room. Then transferred me to a mental health emergency room. I got lucky I was transferred. Another time my own mental capacity put me in restraints. It wasn’t physical or chemical. I was just trying to block thoughts. It was in a Medicaid psych ward with all white walls. That’s a perfect example of why WHO puts sz second as most disabling. I can’t imagine the most sick of us who deal with that 24/7. One time they gave me a pill. I laid down and couldn’t move for awhile. My whole body was like frozen. I was thinking. It’s just I couldn’t physically move. A few times I requested the B-52 injection. They said they gave it to me. I even felt the needle. It didn’t do anything for me. I wasn’t even tired or anything remotely like some people describe. Those are my stories having to do with being restrained.
176062736,"I was slapped to my face by my sister, kicked out of the house I lived with my housemates. Was reported to the police and was incarnated. Spent inside mental hospital 4 months and did not see a daylight for the time. All my friends left me, was shouted by my mother for a whole year because it was my fault to get SZ. I wish I have got cancer instead of sz it is biggest curse in mankind. I have never heard that person with cancer would receive the same treatment as SZ"
176062737,I went to a psychatric center for an assessment. I told them I was hearing voice before sleep and such. She asked me several other questions and I explained how I felt. She had to make a call to their doctor on whether to admit me or not. They gave me a bunch of information on places to get counseling and released me. I’m just really stressed about this and don’t know what to do for help.
176062738,It’s not my story. My family knows I sit at home all the time and they don’t care. All they know is that I’m happy now and before I was abjectly miserable and suicidal. That’s enough for them to know. They’re happy for me.
176062739,"Thank you for the update! I hope there is more research like this. I know there is not much research being done for the prevention of schizophrenia. But, we have to start somewhere. I do hope the newer medications work for some people. I think if the cause of schizophenia is found, we can target this and do something dramatic. I find that medications now are hit or miss. Some people with schizophrenia benefit whereas others don’t from medication. Producing more medications without understanding the cause of the disease is not helpful for those with schizophenia or psychosis. Medications are like bandages. What is the cause/ the source should be investigated thoroughly instead of making more medications. The best we as people with schizophrenia can do is to take our medications for the rest of our lives. This is profitable for the pharmaceutical companies. But it is a life-long sentence for those with schizophrenia. These are the reasons I am dissatisfied when I hear there are more medications on 
the market each year but not much research into the cause/ prevention of schizophrenia. My hope is that one day schizophrenia is preventable and more manageable. All I see now is medication advertisements everywhere but no real answers of preventing it. Schizophrenia causes severe disability. The cost of people’s lives destroyed by this disease is immeasurable. We continually suffer from the illness or from side effects of medication. Medication is not a panacea but just a temporary fix. Truthfully,I wish I did not have to take medication to prevent psychosis. I know many others who feel the same. I wish there were healthier alternatives to medication. So, much can be done in schizophrenia research besides developing new medications. Thank you again for this information about testing for schizophrenia and disease -modifying treatments."

176062852,I used to believe it before treatment because I saw it on youtube. It makes no sense now. They are normal people like you.
176062853,"To be honest with you, that sounds like a disaster just waiting to happen. Voices aren’t completely gone for a large period of time, you’ve got stress and anxiety just thinking about the trip. I know I’d find things to stress over the planning and feeling insecure to the safety of me leaving. The last time you were there was in episode, all of those thoughts and fears may come rushing back, same with where you would stay. In due time, I believe that would be accomplishable. How you envision it. The trip could do you well. If done at the right time. But right now, With what you’ve described, I don’t know if it’s wise. I don’t mean to burst your bubble dude, But I don’t know If it would be safe for you right now to do this alone. Got any buddies to go with you?"

Once cold turkey on my own, and once as a slow taper over time under supervision. Going cold turkey put me right in the hospital against my will. I was in a very bad place.

176062868,Do you have a habit out of making things mean something? Like an example if make a mistake or do something ‘stupid’ you make it mean something negative about yourself? I do. There’s a lot of examples I could give. Like if you do something like make some kind of mistake you make it mean something negative about you and you think you’re stupid or bad? Or both? That tends to be how the negative spiral starts for me and it tends to just make you worse really fast.

It really helped to stabilize my mood swings and manic episodes. As far as side effects go it would make me really sick to my stomach in the early mornings if I didn’t eat with it. It also made me super thirsty all the time. Over all I think it was a good drug.

Most people would have a thought without a second thought, it would pass by.

Hopefully your psychiatrist comes through for you, and it gets back to normal. And schizophrenics can lead nice lives, if it was me I’d seek the people that matter to me the most, who love me, and cry and tell them to take charge for a while. Chances are they know what to do more than you do at the moment. It could be your sister, brother or your parents. I read this term on the forum a while back. Mortal coil. You’ll be doing ok for a while, then you get depressed or your suddenly a full blown psychotic, then a year later you’ve dusted yourself to a certain extent and you even feel hopeful. You just have to manage life i suppose. It was written in the stars, for me as well as most people here. They can add an antidepressant as well, that would help you cope hopefully."

I still do it because I don’t want to fall. I am extremely careful, but I am aching in pain all the time. And my family suffers with me. I love my family. But my doctor isn’t feeling very hopeful about me, and told me that limiting my diet won’t do much. My mom says things like “if you weren’t sick, we could have done this or that…etc” in a sad voice sometimes and I feel like a huge burden. I know that she just doesn’t want me to be sick, and I totally get that. We were worried that my dad will get stressed out after work when he sees me, so the rest of the family made a rule for me: that is, not showing my symptoms when he comes home. I don’t know if that’s working though. My heart is aching so much because I feel responsible for my illness. I want to get better so much, so that I could spare my family the t
rouble of caregiving. I love them so much, and I know that they are very concerned about me. I feel like I owe my family so much. I just want them to be ok. It just hurts me because I feel like I’m hurting them. I don’t know what to do."

The movements are somewhat tied to my delusions. I have been to multiple doctors to get help for it and they haven’t provided me with a solution. I got checked for tardive dyskinesia by multiple doctors and all of them said that it wasn’t TD. I went to a neurologist and they didn’t help. Does anyone have any ideas that might help me?

I took supplements which may have hurt me in the long run but cured by dp/dr and hellish reality like 2d vision and fakeness/unreality and extreme detachment and dissociation.

174358007,"They took a group of people with schizophrenia, and in one group they did targeted cognitive training, in the other, targeted cognitive training plus social cognitive training. Both groups had 70 hours of training. After 6 months they tested both groups for cognition, social cognition, reward processing, symptoms and functioning and found significant gains for both groups. The group that got both kinds of training had improvement in more areas than the ones that had the single kind of training. They also found that gains in cognition often meant gains in functional capacity, and gains in reward processing led to gains in social functioning. That’s important because they’re not just “teaching to the test” they are actually teaching something that helped people out in their daily lives, and that the improvements were still there 6 months after training. From the full paper: SocialVille , the social cognitive intervention used here, is grounded in the principles of neuroplasticity and designed 
to improve the fidelity of representations of socially relevant stimuli while simultaneously targeting processing speed, working memory, and attentional control Here’s an example of the changes in global cognition over time: At baseline: 29.41 After 40 hours training: 31.57 after 70 hours training: 32.91 6 months after training ended: 36.06 PANSS also decreased modestly, about 4 points."

I did it I think for two weeks went without drinking much soda only to have a extreme headache from caffeine withdrawal so I went back to drinking soda again. If I could completely drop that and the snacks I think I would lose more weight I don’t know what does everyone else think just my personal opinion.

I use to have a few bad habits and have stopped masturbation, I never looked at porn but found that masturbation made me nervous and incapable of achieving anything the day after I did it. So I stopped about 3 weeks ago and haven’t done it since. I feel better already and I’m already making progress on some online courses. I wasted from 20 to 32 (my current age) not knowing how much harm this was doing and despite what people in this forum say, including the moderators, I feel it does immense damage.

I just don’t have good social skills and when I am picked on or harrassed I just quit. It’s the people that I can’t stand. My nerves just get to me. I struggle with anxiety. I think I am going to be like you now and just say no to family gatherings. They stress me out too. But they are always at my mom’s house and I live with her so it’s hard to avoid. Sometimes I am actually thankful that I have schizophrenia because I think of I was a normie I probably wouldn’t be able to keep a job either.

Then I beat myself up for years about why I was having delusions. I didn’t believe the diagnosis, I thought I was faking it for some reason I didn’t understand and was trying to ‘think’ my way out of it.

176063123,"I tried having sex for the first time when i was becoming paranoid at 20 years old and i couldnt get hard any way even by physical stimulation, and i thought it was anxiety. So after my first episode I went to paychiatrist and told her and she just made a note and didnt sag anything, so i went on so far by making an appoinment with urologist and he prescribed _NAME_ pills that didnt do anything besides increasing my heart rate. Then i thought it was testasterone and I got normal results. So i started finally to think it was due to medication and then i found this forum and read also side effects of risperidone. My doctor caused a lot of shame and anxiety by letting me telling a bunch of doctors in my town saying i have a limp dick. Thanks to med change everything is back, even full ejaculations. Some doctors say that having libido and ability sex doesnt matter, but i say otherwise because that what mostly makes a man and a woman having attraction and one of the main pleasure in life, or am i wrong?

Take the pills same time everyday to get your body in the routine and set an alarm…set it for before you’ll regularly wake up and get up. No snooze or sleeping in. Get up and do some exercise at least to start!

176063158,Hello I want to share my experience of psychosis to see if anyone else had similar experiences that I can relate to When I was psychotic I felt mentally high. IT was like a rush of dopamine. However my entire life I was spent trying to conquer dark and demonic forces that I felt were controlling me. I used to hear things that I thought people said when they were near me but it was an illusion. Sometimes it looked like people were crying but they won’t. I saw energy and things I didn’t think I shouldn’t be seeing. Everything in my life was about some sort of spiritual warfare. I spent entire days out in the streets standing in corners performing odd movements or reciting long medical facts from memory and I would see like a clear energy surrounding me that got stronger. I felt I was under a backfire all the time Then I was admitted to.hospital and a day after my anti-psychotic shot all of this just disappeared. Just like that everything I knew about life was just fake and unreal. All the nonsen
se seemed absurd. It was a really hard time for me as I lost my ability to feel pleasure and I was like a zombie I repeatedly fell I’ll in hospital - I used to shout angrily almost violently at staff and got into a few physical fights. Then I came across Olanzapine and things started improving. I was able to enjoy life again At present things are very good mentally but I don’t understand the concept of saving money. I have strange compulsions to spend money My intelligence seems blocked. When I was psychotic I could see the beauty of science and mathematics but now I see nothing. Can anyone relate to this?
176063159,"Yes, but you’re not our Prime Minister."

176063164,"TBH, the whole “I’m the second smartest person in the history of the human race after _PERSON_” plays into the whole delusions I have. That I took NZT or the Limitless drug in a parallel universe and that movie isn’t freaking fiction but based on a possible future where people take and the elite are given enhancements/experiments. I still have residual effects I guess. I called it Adderall 2.0. In the movie/TV show, the guy who took it became the smartest person alive, but I’ve been told by various sources I was the second smartest person alive despite having an average IQ. Maybe it was my creativity or intuition qoutient… It all sounds like ????????, insane stuff a crazy person would say. But this sort of stuff makes me paranoid. Even had thoughts about the reality warping drug in “Flow my Tears the Policeman Said”-- that that stuff is possible or even real at one time. It sends one to a parallel universe where one doesn’t exist at all lol. Hence, my delusions. Psychosis could ha

I should get used to others but it will be harder after so much isolation. I tried many meds, no one didn’t work on 100 %… The Zyprexa is the best for me, few side effects… But do you agree, that at our worst, the aps are like candies for us? That’s what said to me a doc and he 
was probably right… Delusions are hard to detach from I guess. If we were attached to them for years wow… I think I have depression and anxiety too, but ill work on this as I can, no meds for it.

These vaccines were mainly tested on healthy adults and I just found out today that there are very few studies on how they affect the population over 60 years old, especially those suffering from health issues. There are too many unknowns when it comes to the Covid vaccines. At least the influenza vaccines have been studied over a span of many years. And they are FDA approved. If you don’t mind would it be possible to send a link to that info? I’m not buying that the Covid vaccines are safer than the flu vaccines. Covid is a more potent virus than the flu so the effects are going to be greater. Plus there are just not enough studies when it comes to the Covid vaccines."

176063186,"When I took strattera i become very anxious, nervous. Before taking it was very calm and relaxed soon after I took it I become nervous and felt like my each and every step, words I spoke is judged by others. This occurs because it increases adrenaline the stress hormone in brain as its a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. So you can assure your worsening paranoia may be due to this drug especially if you have paranoia due to illness. If doctor prescribed you this then I suggest you to find opinion from another doctor as its a dangerous drug to take especially for paranoid people. Its basically an adhd medication but if have paranoia it should not be prescribed even if have adhd just like in bipolar depression. Ssri is used for depression but it can cause mania in bipolar depression thus its avoided even if have depression in bipolar.

174358050,Here goes my unscientific opinion (in no way should this be taken as gospel). I was told the _NAME_ from respiridone was caused by elevated prolactin. It has been observed that adding a small dose of abilify (like 2-5mg) to your respiridone can reverse this high prolactin. So maybe you could stay on your respiridone and not get _NAME_. As with all advice of a lay person speak to your doctor first

I had a herpes cold sore between my legs last week so I couldn’t have sex while it’s there. There are vaccines for hpv that a future partner could take before sex so they don’t get it. I didn’t know I had it till a few years ago. I remember I told my boyfriend about it and he said “do you see me running away”. He said as long as it’s nothing that will immediately kill him but he did want to keep a distance when I had cold sore which I did too. I don’t want to give him cold sores.

All four of them were calm and laughing while everybody around them was going crazy. But yeah, musicians in general to me seem pretty laid back and mellow and love what they do. Drugs and alcohol and hard living take their toll but the process of actually producing music and performing it with your friends and band members seems like it would be a blast and one of the best things on earth as a job. But there is a lot of pressure for the top artists to come up with new hits all the time and all that touring is certainly taxing so you’re right about that."

I kind of grimaced and said, yeah that’s a bad thing. She asked why and I told her I’d rather get the respect and look older Anyways we chatted and one thing led to another and I told her, “I just want to be left alone”. (Not by her, I meant in general). By this time I was kind of feeling I revealed too much and she might guess I have a mental illness (which she might already know). But I said sometimes I glare to get people to stop bothering me. She told me, “But you look so friendly and you have such a friendly face and people must be attracted to you.” What could I say?

But you’re not. This should be discussed with a therapist.

176063318,"There are people that have put their SZ in remission with a low fat low protein strict raw vegan diet that provides a surplus of antioxidants that can heal the brain, but 99.99% of people won’t do that. Heck, I’m health obsessed and even I don’t want to do that. Would feel like having a salad feedbag strapped to my face all day. I’m looking for the middle ground with a somewhat healthy diet, Alkaline water (has ample antioxidant-like properties), and supplements. Best supplement I’ve found for symptoms so far is Amyloban 3399. It has helped a half dozen people on the forum so far. I’m going to experiment with a mitochondrial antioxidant, SkQ1, in a month.

176063327,If you are in the LA area I recommend bill la tour. Hes both a psychologist and lawyer. He got me approve when I was denied in the past. His office or team set up disability exam and all. If you dont have _PERSON_ in your area then try to find a similar lawyer with psychology experience. Just be honest and yourself at exam. Good luck!

But after 12 months of ap Lurasidone my cholesterol is now elevated. Such a bummer side effect. I hope they can give you some helpful advice to lower your cholesterol. My fear is that I’ll have to go on yet another med to treat my cholesterol, that my diet will be restricted (all the yummy things like cheese & bacon), that high cholesterol may lead to heart disease eventually. by the way, how are you going? I know you were trying to set up some day hospital services & trying zoloft for intrusive thoughts."

Give up” ? 4: I don’t have delusions of grandeur, it’s a fact I’m a god trapped into a flesh prison. Only one visit. I’ve started buying those sticky socks just out of comfort, I don’t slip on hardwood floor anymore! Woooo sockies! Sweatpants are my attire.

I was on 120 mg Went down to 80mg Then down to 40mg And now back to 80 mg Has anyone else felt a type of anger and rage from latuda? Is it latuda? I have been loving latuda . I used to have jaw clenching that hurt so much but that went away. Now I have been feeling a intense rage and anger that doesn’t feel like me. Feels like I’m feeling someone else’s anger etc? I don’t feel so much like myself when I be feeling this way. I don’t get angry easily or often. When I was a child I could get angry but not as a adult I have felt so peaceful and no anger. Trying to ride it out and hopefully it will go away soon. Can’t volunteer work this week because of it. Is this because of latuda do you think? Has latuda done this to you of something similar?

176063354,"My voices (and also inserted thoughts) have told me different things about what I’ve done wrong in my life, some of which I didn’t even remember/realize I did wrong. Now they’re telling they’re not sure if it’s because I was obsessive or because I was stupid, but either way their theory is that it’s an illness of the consciousness/soul, not a mental problem, which is why it can’t be fixed and why I have to be tortured after death. I’ve learned that the process that controls what the voices say might also control my body. The voices probably don’t directly control my body, because sometimes it behaves strangely even without the voices telling what it’s going to do in advance. And I learned that the process that controls the voices may also control my dreams, because the voices could tell in advance what’s going to happen in my dream. Regarding the last 2 things, there may be 2 different processes, one of which “sees” what the other is doing (in other words how the voices kn
ow what’s going to happen), or it may be the same process."

If you’re talking about how long it took for it to be noticed that more was going on than severe mental illness, irrespective of whether there was an _PERSON_’s dx to cover it, then it’s just under 46 years. In autumn/winter 1973 I first saw a pdoc, and in May 2019 I got the _PERSON_’s dx and recognition there was more going on than just severe mental illness ."
176063369,"So I’ve been spending all my time online recently. My shiatsu course doesn’t start until February and even then it’s only once a week. Yesterday I spent the day trying to bust my way out of being institutionalized. It is not the best approach. My life is good when I’m not relapsing. I’m just worried because when I relapse, the only people who save me are my parents. The NHS doesn’t cater to my particular needs when I relapsing. Whenever I express my needs when relapsing they come down hard on me, putting more pressure on me, and making it worse. I really think this is cultural. There is a cultural disconnect between them and me. Only my parents really know me and to some extent my friends. This is why I want to be more independent. I want to carve out a life for me where I get the support I need from people who understand. I have nothing against the NHS, they have been grossly underpaid, and not trained well in dealing with people like me for the most part, but I do think they work hard
. The problem is I cannot rely on them to help me. I want to have a similar life to the one I have now, just with the necessary support base that isn’t reliant on my parents. Yesterday I was worrying about my position in terms of status. So long as I am diagnosed, I am financially secure. If I were to move away from the NHS then I wouldn’t necessarily be financially secure. So I was seeing finding a way to change my status and become financially secure as the first step. An alternative first step would be to find a life partner who could be there for me when I relapse. But once again, I feel that my status prohibits this. I am not interested in titles for titles sake, but status is important in life. My approach to changing this was and has been too bombastic. The problem is, I can carry on being content with how I am at the moment, but when the time comes for my parents to move to another plane, where will I be. I need to set goals that will help me to secure a future that will carry me through beyond th
at time. At the moment I really feel trapped. If I forget all about the future, I can be content. But knowing how bad it gets when I relapse, and that only my parents are really there for me at such times, worries me. I really am at a loss of what to do. Thank you."

Still its upsetting to know that fantastic and innovative new stories are out there, that are just going to cause me to question reality again. Glad I’m settled now that its the following day and I’m watching it again, and nothings happening, so I think if thats all thats going to happen then I’m fine. Didn’t really affect what I did that night outside of being in that spiritual feeling sort of lucid state of confusion. Bummed that this is gonna have to be something I watch out for from now on."

I’ve got one good friend, and some acquantinces (can’t spell either) but mostly just hole up in my house. Not sure how much of that to pin on sza, and how much is just being an introvert. Finances are also a challenge. It’s hard to resist buying that gleaming bit of electronics, though I’m fortunately not drowning in bills at the moment. And psydocs, therapy and medications can be expensive."

174358144,IMO the physical aspects of anxiety are overemphasised . That is not to deny physical symptoms occur. They do . However on a lot of tests for anxiety if you don’t say you have many physical symptoms your anxiety can be wrongly described as ‘mild’ . In my case I experience both general and social anxiety. I’m also quite avoidant .These are regarded as secondary problems to a relatively more severe diagnosis like schizoaffective.
176063517,"I don’t necessarily believe in a lot of that stuff, but if you are laying in a guided relaxation for 40 minutes a day, I could see that being hugely beneficial for the anxieties that cause insomnia. Acupuncture really helped my insomnia, even though a lot of people called it a scam for me. But my current meds have gotten rid of my insomnia anyways."
176063518,yea you should mention it to your pdoc… then he/she can look at what it could be and then maybe you can do something about it.

175104659,"https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/herd-immunity/ Below is an excerpt from the above link to the website for the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) — What is herd immunity? Herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely. Even individuals not vaccinated (such as newborns and the immunocompromised) are offered some protection because the disease has little opportunity to spread within the community. Vaccines prevent many dangerous and deadly diseases. In the United States, smallpox and polio have both been stamped out because of vaccination. However, there are certain groups of people who cannot get vaccinated and are vulnerable to disease: babies, pregnant women, and immunocompromised people, such as those receiving chemotherapy or organ transplants. For example, the earliest a baby can receive 
their first pertussis or whooping cough vaccine is at two months, and the earliest a child can receive their first measles vaccine is at one year, making them vulnerable to these diseases. Herd immunity depends on the contagiousness of the disease. Diseases that spread easily, such as measles, require a higher number of immune individuals in a community to reach herd immunity. Herd immunity protects the most vulnerable members of our population. If enough people are vaccinated against dangerous diseases, those who are susceptible and cannot get vaccinated are protected because the germ will not be able to “find” those susceptible individuals. When can we expect herd immunity for COVID-19? COVID-19 is a very contagious disease. A large percentage of the population will need to be immune against the disease (through infection or vaccination) before herd immunity will be achieved. It is not known when that will happen, but it will depend on how many people develop immunity after COVID-19 infection, how soon 
a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, how many vaccine doses will be available for distribution, and how many people get vaccinated. Throughout this time period until herd immunity is achieved, it is very important to continue to wear masks in public and social distance to slow the spread of COVID-19. Several drug makers have developed promising vaccines for COVID-19 and have submitted applications for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If the FDA approves the vaccines for use, then the focus will shift to manufacturing the vaccine, educating members of the public about the vaccine, and distribution of the vaccine. Although these efforts will take some time to achieve, vaccines have proven to be the safest, most cost-effective way to protect people from disease. APIC continues to monitor and advocate on policies affecting each one of these steps and will continue to share consumer information via our social media channels."""

176063524,"My step daughter and one of my granddaughters do private care for several people with dementia. It can be a hard job, and is poorly paid. There usually comes a time when help provided in their own home isn’t enough, and moving the person into a care home becomes necessary . I don’t know exactly how old you are Wave, but reaching a certain age, and adding anxiety to the mix , can make you hypersensitive to any perceived changes in cognition. This especially true if there is a family history of dementia . Reversible causes of memory loss Many medical problems can cause memory loss or other dementia-like symptoms. Most of these conditions can be treated. Your doctor can screen you for conditions that cause reversible memory impairment. Possible causes of reversible memory loss include: Medications. Certain medications or a combination of medications can cause forgetfulness or confusion. Minor head trauma or injury. A head injury from a fall or accident — even if you don’t lose consciousness 
 can cause memory problems. Emotional disorders. Stress, anxiety or depression can cause forgetfulness, confusion, difficulty concentrating and other problems that disrupt daily activities. Alcoholism. Chronic alcoholism can seriously impair mental abilities. Alcohol can also cause memory loss by interacting with medications. Vitamin B-12 deficiency. Vitamin B-12 helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells. A vitamin B-12 deficiency — common in older adults — can cause memory problems. Hypothyroidism. An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can result in forgetfulness and other thinking problems. Brain diseases. A tumor or infection in the brain can cause memory problems or other dementia-like symptoms. When to see your doctor If you’re concerned about memory loss, see your doctor. There are tests to determine the degree of memory impairment and diagnose the cause. Your doctor is likely to ask you questions. It’s good to have a family member or friend along to answer some questions b
ased on observations. Questions might include: When did your memory problems begin? What medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements, do you take and in what doses? Have you recently started a new drug? What tasks do you find difficult? What have you done to cope with memory problems? How much alcohol do you drink? Have you recently been in an accident, fallen or injured your head? Have you recently been sick? Do you feel sad, depressed or anxious? Have you recently had a major loss, a major change or stressful event in your life? https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/memory-loss/art-_PHONE_NO_"

I was good at math in school starting from 4th grade onwards but I always idolized my dad who studied meteorology in China and Computer Science in the US. My dad wanted me to stay on the arts and literature side and I have talent for reading and writing, but I studied a little computer science in college too and it helped me learn to set traps and stuff… Anyways most of my college projects and papers were fine, but I had a fascination with _USER_ID_ and obtaining the powers of deductive logic. I had no idea that nobody on the right likes anything about _USER_ID_ technology. But I did do a red and black honey bee hive in art class (yeah, I didn’t study anything useful in college) and did some research into the art of mathematics. I didn’t know deductive reasoning is subnatural and configuring to the mind. In fact, common sense and concrete reasoning is probably not necessary for most technological endeavors and it 
is something the world can live without. Oh, and in case you’re wondering what foods I’m craving lately it’s hamburgers, pork, lemon cake, lemonade, and obviously salmon, coconut milk, and _USER_ID_. And avocados, Peking duck, eggs, and cucumbers and Hong Kong milk tea with cheese. Tuesday I have support group and can get another cup of Cheese Tea. Fattening I know. It also takes away time I could be spending with the puppies. Took the puppies to the park today!!!

I am eating something I want to recommend to my fellow weight loss friends - I saw some Protein One strawberries and cream bars last week where they sell granola bars. They are only 90 calories. I am having one as a snack and it’s totally kicking my sugar cravings to the curb.

174358147,"When meeting criteria for clinical remission, symptoms can be present but must be mild in nature. OUP Academic Toward a Terminology for Functional Recovery in Schizophrenia: Is Functional... Abstract. Recovery in schizophrenia is receiving increasing attention. Part of the increased focus is based on the recent working criteria for clinical remissi It would seem according to such a definition I’m in clinical remission . Functional recovery is another matter. From what I can make out it involves a return to premorbid levels of functioning . That can be quite a low hurdle to jump over if like me you became mentally ill at a fairly young age, and have never worked or had a good social network. I may be in remission , but I don’t see myself as functioning at the level that the average non-mentally ill person of my age does .

176063549,Question now is how do you defeat AI? You shut it off? How do you shut off your mind? By sleeping? Through sedatives? Tranquilizers?
176063550,"My voices have gotten much worse. They were always mean but used to be nice sometimes. Now, if they are ever nice, they call me a sucker for believing them."
176063551,My pdoc doesn’t like me being on so many ap’s. I take 800 mg of Seroquel. It helps with the voices and sleep.
176063552,I don’t have that. But I’m sorry you do
176063553,"I found this incredibly helpful in therapy. The idea is, we are better at forgiving others than ourselves. So imagine a close friend who has gone through the same things as you, and write them a letter to comfort them."
176063554,I think it is pretty good at the moment what I know of. I had ovarian cancer in the past so I had surgery and do check ups once a year. I also breath 99% through my mouth. There were discussions of surgery when I was a child but it never happened. Maybe I should talk to my dr about it. I feel like I’m in invisible restraints which can physically hurt a bit sometimes and feel uncomfortable. I feel it every day and night and it disturbs me. I’m a few kg overweight and I can’t seem to lose it right now even though I try. I’m not as fit as I was when I went to the gym. Otherwise I can’t think of anything else physical right now.
176063555,"I don’t know if this is catatonic, but I didn’t move sometimes for a couple days at a time. It wasn’t that my mind was blank, it was that I entered into a deep meditation. I wanted to focus on the images and visions of my mind."
176063556,Part of the problem is that while in conflict I may have illustrated my superior was a ‘tattle tale.’ It was psychological warfare and we both got creative. Thus i didn’t want to bring it to light now and become one myself. Also with this stuff there tends to be embarrassing elements about oneself. But (ones) enemies in this world bank on that stopping you. Maybe the word ‘elegance’ is inaccurate or irrelevant. I just for a long time didn’t want to invite ‘poetic desserts’ of some kind back to me.

174358150,The only thing my medication helps me with is sleep. My positive symptoms are really bad and painfull.
176063564,I learned to accept it because I also was refusing meds and had a really crap Halloween I thought witches were trying to take my soul and the doctors were going to saw my head in half because of my ex girlfriend and a lot of other things happened but basically I ended up in the psych ward again.

176063568,Welcome to the forum!
176063569,Lobotomies also made people unable to function. I think we only need institutions for violent people who are mentally ill.

I’m grateful for my dog and his good health and that he had his claws cut for free. I’m grateful I have a place to live and everything in it.

I’m grateful for my former stepmother and how good she is to me and she enriches my life in so many ways and supports me in so many ways also emotionally by calling me on the phone morning time and having a talk and teaching me how to drive independently to shopping centre. My parents and that my loved ones are still alive. _PERSON_ is my friend after over twenty years. My car and that it’s working. That I’m on a vegan diet. My hor

It does help so I can afford to buy vegan chicken etc at supermarket. My pension. It changed my life. Looking for work and working stressed me out more than I could cope with in the end. It’s lovely and helpful to just take care of myself and my pets and that’s enough for me.it is! All the delicious plant based food available.
176063571,Thanks again _AT_MENTION_!
174358151,"At times I feel like maybe I’m faking it with negative symptoms cuz I can’t get going on anything, but it’s a very unatural feeling, and i know what it feels like when there isn’t any symptoms so that’s how I can tell I’m not faking it. And looking back at the psychosis episodes I had there is a 0% chance I was faking it was way too insane."
176063572,Hey good day how are you feeling??
176063573,My OCD is based on poor working memory issue. Its different from usual OCD in which a serotonin deficiency is there. With working memory related OCD if take serotonin things it can make working memory worse but urge to respond to doubt reduces. I mean intrusive thoughts get reduced as it makes working memory and short term memory worse so very difficult to process thoughts.

I also try to be gentle with myself too… I make my small walks outside now, but always alone and not for long. But I wonder if the psychic state can get better at home?.. I have no other choice in fact either… But I wont complain. I also think that my loneliness feelings were quite delusional, cause at least still I have my mom and my sister… I felt soo much unloved in the past, but this isn’t true. Its up that I change on this too now . I find that I wanted way too much in a way before, never satisified…"

176063591,"I was in a relationship with a woman who wasn’t abusive, but she wasn’t that smart. She talked endlessly about things I wasn’t interested in, and every minute I was with her I was counting the seconds until I could get away. I stayed with her for four years. I can’t believe that. The thing is, she was a school teacher, and I was delivering pizza for a living. She took me at a time no one else would. I kind of felt obligated because of that."

176063594,what did they do with the balls?
176063595,"Sounds like you’re in denial man. It’s dangerous. I’ve felt the same way too early on. Even had a doctor tell me that one time that I was never probably psychotic, but she changed her mind. I don’t know what triggered it. Maybe adderall? Maybe stress. Maybe a lot of factors. I went down hill in 2015. I still haven’t hallucinated in my entire life except hearing voices and stuff when falling alseep and sleeping. Even normies have that. I think my case deserves to be documented. I’m still flabbergasted that I haven’t received any media attention or attention yet in terms of case studies and crap."

176063606,I was on 20 mg for 3 years and today my doctor lowered me to 15 mg. The reason was because I was sleeping too much and I was losing normal motivation. It has kept me out of the hospital and prevented a relapse.

174358156,"As mentioned before, my body appears to be moving by itself. There have been a few instances when my body was behaving overall similar to how I would behave in a situation, but it did something differently, and then something remembered how I would have done it, and then changed the behavior to match how I would have behaved. This may indicate that I’m not controlling my body even when it behaves as I would, because what is controlling my body is copying my behavior."

Best I can offer is to keep fighting, it may come on a good day. Giving yourself time to heal when things are foggy, and keep with meds."

I drastically changed my diet after seeing myself in a full length mirror in one of Walmart’s fitting rooms. Now I eat no bread, and eat small portions or try to skip a meal if at all possible. The medicine still has me eating at night, sleep walking to the kitchen, normally grabbing cereal, leaving a mess in the kitchen or living room, and remembering none of it. The medicine made me extremely sleepy after taking it. When I was first put on it, I was given 5 mg. in the morning and 10 mg. at night. Some days I would sleep most of the day away, and still sleep well at night. Finally my doctor told me I could take 1 dose only at night and increased it to 15 mg. I’ve been on the medication since the middle of September 2018. It took a couple weeks for me to finally experience silence in my mind. Now I work a full time job as a server, constantly around 
other people; there was a time before I started Zyprexa where I was anxious in crowds, knowing the voices were listening and thinking they were watching my every move made me self conscious, my self esteem was completely shattered, and I felt awkward all the time. Today I don’t experience any of that. I feel more like I did before the voices started. Even though things have gotten better and the majority of my day the voices are quiet, I still hear them. I don’t mind hearing them. They have gotten much nicer and I guess I’ve gotten used to them. I will say a prayer for you tonight, I hope you get the best results possible!"

See details below: Sarcosine News Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism & Toxicology, February 2021 Sarcosine as an add-on treatment to antipsychotic medication for people with schizophrenia: a systematic review and _NAME_-analysis of randomized controlled trials Conclusions : People with chronic and non-refractory schizophrenia may benefit from the use of sarcosine as an add-on treatment to a
ntipsychotic medication. www.tandfonline.com British Journal of Psychiatry, 2019 “Sarcosine, which is freely sold as a dietary supplement, has pharmacological activity to boost functioning of the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and hence it is a biologically rational treatment for schizophrenia. The small number of studies carried out to date provide some evidence for its efficacy and psychiatrists could consider suggesting its use to their patients.” “Sarcosine differs from the drugs that can be prescribed to treat schizophrenia in that patients can obtain it for themselves. Even though it is sold as a dietary supplement, there is reasonable evidence that it has a real pharmacological effect that may produce useful benefits in some patients. ""It seems to be almost universally well tolerated with an absence of significant side-effects, with the exception of two cases of transient hypomania in patients who were taking antidepressants. These cases suggest that caution should be exerci
sed in patients taking serotonergic [SSRI] medication.” “Individual professionals and services will draw their own conclusions but it seems reasonable to conclude that suggesting sarcosine to patients with schizophrenia would be a defensible evidence-based intervention.” Read the full article at link below: A possible role for sarcosine in the management of schizophrenia A possible role for sarcosine in the management of schizophrenia - Volume 215 Issue 6 www.cambridge.org Dietary supplement may help with schizophrenia A dietary supplement, sarcosine, may help with schizophrenia as part of a holistic approach complementing antipsychotic medication, according to a UCL researcher. www.sciencedaily.com 9 Incredible Health Benefits of Sarcosine + Side Effects Did you know that it [sarcosine] may improve the symptoms of mental health disorders such as schizophrenia and depression?

176063728,when I first started using myfitnesspal to track my calories there were days where I was only getting 600 calories a day and I was not losing any weight. My doctor said I shut down my metabolism. She had me go up to 1800 to start my metabolism over again and add exercise to help me lose weight. I couldn’t eat that much and wound up eating about 1500. Now I’m doing fine at 1200-1400 and losing but I’m much bigger and don’t exercise. I would think 1400 would be a good place for you to try or even 1500 because you exercise everyday.

176063886,Well I do admit I had some fault in it falling apart. And there were other smaller incidents before this but nothing like “world ending” So basically I was abused by a therapist as a kid and it really ?????? me up. I also have had other therapists (mainly in childhood) that didn’t help me and had some… Questionable actions… So I was talking about my experience with that and I said “Man… ???? therapists” referring to the therapists that messed me up She stops me and said “so EVERY therapist including me? ???? all of them??” Like very aggressive And it devolved into a huge argument… Things were said I got triggered really badly and I got thrown out. Which like honestly I didn’t really want to continue with her after some of the things she said Such as “I think you deserved what those doctors did to you” Which is really ?????? considering I constantly wonder/worry about if I deserved to be abused… So like I wouldn’t go back to her even if I could but like it was so sudde
n and I didn’t expect her to turn on me like that at all Like I know I probably could have handled the situation better but like… Damn it sucks I will say she had slowly but surely been getting less patient with me cause she had some health issues. But like that’s no excuse to take it out on a patient… Tbh idk if I’m super making sense right now.

176063943,We’re all judging you because this is complete hypocrisy.
176063944,"I’ve read some of your post bro and struggled with the same things. I’m sorry brother, I don’t have any advice. About 10 years ago I smoked herb with someone who believed they were Satan. After that I started experiencing the same thing you’ve been going through. It’s confusing because I just wanted some kind of proof that it was all real or it was all false. I also struggled with the word one, It’s just a common word. I got somewhat better when I got girlfriend at the time. There’s power in being hugged by someone that cares about you."

176063950,"I read the part on your website about 1st person transcripts. It’s an interesting theory, I successfully became stable with sz after being in psychosis for a few years. I did not utilize medication instead used a similar approach. Each “vision” was weighted against the other. When one vision was contradictory to another I knew that they couldn’t both be right. This process of elimination helped me to relieve my mind of excess thought. I wrote extensively during this time, but unfortunately lost most of my records. I’m currently writing my life journey, early childhood and beyond. It’s interesting that you talk about removing the names from the recordings. I have done this in my writing as a way to help the reader understanding the dissociation that I felt throughout my life. I would like to see more work in this type of sz treatment, but I think you need a bit more work on your methodology. For one, there’s a lot of controversy, at least in Canada, over sz being present in children. I
t is listed as being an adult or young adult sickness. (more research could be conducted in this area) Also, I don’t think that the individual needs to know that they are experiencing delusions or hallucinations. I still don’t think that I merely hallucinated everything I saw, yet I’m stable. I have a job, I’m raising a family, and I’m involved in my community. Anyways, would love to chat more about this stuff. Send me a private message if you like."
176063951,"I know I should try harder. Ive become quite the pessimist. I have such fear though of people. There is no such thing as a safe person in my life now. And that’s what I deserve probably, but I’d do anything for one last chance to be accepted and have the opportunity to behave properly. Maybe it isn’t always ‘never too late to change’. I ?????? up my whole life. This pain compounded by hopelessness and not a soul who cares about you…it’s unreasonable."

174358211,"It’s possible. I credit three things to anything I’ve accomplished in my disease: Lot’s of help Lots of hard work And lots of luck. Stopping doing drugs is the smartest thing you did. I got diagnosed at age 19 too. The following 2 1/2 years were spent in a group home and an 8 month long hospital stay. I suffered horribly in that entire time with not even a minute of relief from frightening, painful symptoms. During those days I had no friends, no money, no girlfriend, no school, no job, no sanity (Of course I had nothing in the hospital). When I got out of the hospital I was 22 and through a series of events I became employed a year later and stayed at that job for 4 years. Unfortunately, I had become addicted to crack when I was 25 or 26. I later got clean when I was 29 but I barely survived the addiction. During my addiction I lost jobs, all my possessions, I almost lost the trust of my family, I risked serious injury most of that time from the places I had to get my drugs, etc. This is why 
I warn people about drugs. You can avoid all that if you’re smart. Anyways, I’ve been almost steadily employed since I was 23; mostly part-time but I worked full time too at certain jobs. So being employed is possible. There’s no overnight cure for schizophrenia, recovery takes place over a period of months or years. But there’s ways around it and like I said, you can still get something out of life. Good luck."
176063957,"Okay. Gotcha. So, perphenazine is your AP, Lexa pro is your AD, trazadone helps you sleep, klonipin is for anxiety, and cogentin is for side effects, right? Klonipin is very addictive. I take buspar, vistaril, effexor xr, and prazosin for anxiety. Maybe those would help your anxiety. I’m no doctor, but it’s worth a try to get you some help. I really don’t know what else to say. I hope you’re feeling better soon. I used to be like some unhelped by meds members. It’s very.frustrating. you can do this!"
176063958,I’m considering taking a very small dose of antipsychotic to help me with it I really hope it helps improve the quality of my life Do antipsychotics act like an antidepressant and antianxiety too?
176063959,"Thing that triggered me to turn for forum,is that I still experience my self as victim of evil around me,and I can’t cope because I was never taught how to deal with the world.I was protected,and then abused by same people I knew.Had nowhere and no one to turn to."

I dont wish what I go through on anyone but I am still thankful for my life things could be worse I could not know I’m sick etc. I cant wait till this pass by.
176063963,Do you think you spend a lot of time trying to prove you’re intelligent? If so to who? Yourself or others? You are and you have nothing to prove to anyone.

176063967,Thanks you too _AT_MENTION_ You recognize it? No way …
176063968,My wife and I should have gotten tested and figured out why we only had one child. I would have liked to have had more. Now we are too old. But since I got sick it’s probably for the best.
176063969,"IDK. People understand me in there. Two nights ago I needed a few things from the store like milk, butter, bread, cereal etc. It was 10:00 pm and armed with my list I went to the Lucky supermarket around the corner. The later you go, the weirder the people so no one is going to look twice at me… So I find I can just space out and take my time and no one bugs me. I was looking at their bulk bins and some guy about 24 or 25 was walking with his girlfriend. They glanced at me and I glanced at them. I thought I gave them a friendly look but the guy decided to be an a*hole and acted all tough and I just looked away and as they walked away, the girl was looking at him like he was some hero or something. Like he was her knight in shining armor who just vanquished the bad guy (me). It just irked me for some reason. I should have let it go but I couldn’t. After about 5 seconds I strode around the corner and looked for them. They were in line and I was about 20 feet away. I just stopped and stared. The g
irl saw me first and then the guy saw me and I wiped that smile off both their faces. He started playing some game that I’ve seen many times before, acting crazy, trying to fool me. I was pissed and I just stood there. Half the time when this stuff occasionally happens I can’t even tell if I’m acting or serious myself, but it feels good and I’m glad I did it. It was even a little fun."
176063970,"Then I’d say stay away from religion. I had to leave religion behind because it kept making me worse and worse. I figure if there is a god, then they probably want me to stay healthy so I can keep doing good in the world, and therefore don’t care if I’m praying or going to church. I can share more with you if you like, but the rest of the stuff I have to say would break the rules of the public forum so if you want, you can PM me about it."
176063971,Like what things?
174358213,Yeah when clozapine alone doesn’t work they sometimes add amisulpride

176063976,I’ve heard from people who get disability that you can only have 2000 dollars of savings in your account at once or they’ll ask you to repay or suspend you’re disability payments. Is this true? I’ve had far more than this in my account and nobody said anything. Do you know anything about this?
176063977,"Just attempted it for the first time in 20 years. Can say it was not a wise choice, even if I thought my reasoning was a good one. Any how, back on drugs, this time the pdoc listened to me about my complaints about the medication and put me on something different."
174358212,"I’m not exactly sure what any of that means, but it seems that ap meds help increase reelin, while sz by nature decreases it. I remember one of my pdcocs told me that abilify was “neuroprotective”."
176063978,"back in 2013 i started playing craps after just asking someone how to play as i had been playing roullette betting black or red. so i figured out that i could bet the field which is like 2, 3, 4 ,9, 11, and 12 i think with 2 and 12 being a triple up bet. i would take 50 bucks on a friday triple it to 150 then come back on saturday and triple it to 500 then come back on sunday and triple it to 1000 or 1500. i did that 3 months in a row essentially winning about 3500 that summer. however the 4th month i took my dads card and withdrew a few hundred to try and keep winning but i lost and they decided i should ban myself from the casino or else they would press charges for the 300 i stole. i willl point out the 50 i started with the first 3 months was my own money though but that 4th month it was just time for me to lose i guess."
176063979,Thank you @anon_PHONE_NO_ ! Thank you _AT_MENTION_ ! I’ve decided to wait on the Ketamine. I will try making other changes first. Thanks!

176063984,"i use to have these problem too, i thought my whole family wants to kill me until i was on medication i realize it was just a delusion in head. I felt really silly about it."

176063988,Wow how lame petty and mean of the person in question. I don’t understand how you could feel happy and moral doing that to someone else.
176063989,i started getting bullied at 13 in high school…first sucidal thought was just before my 14th birthday…what prompted the suicidal thought was not the bullying alone but rather one of the teachers started bullying me too in order to impress the other kids… i should haev been in therapy then but in truth didnt start until i was 22.

176064002,"One thing to note is that BMI is a quick and dirty measure that doesn’t apply to all people. One might have enough muscle mass to meet an obese BMI, but not actually have enough fat on them to qualify as actually obese. One might be of normal weight, but have so little muscle and so much fat (skinny fat) as to be actually obese, but of normal BMI. One sure way to determine body composition (that is the amount of muscle vs. fat) is with a dexascan, but few people would be that curious. BMI as far as obesity is concerned applies to people without much muscle, but I guess that means most people."
176064003,The phrase that gets to me is “love yourself”.
176064004,"Yes blank mind, its due to low working memory as when we think or do something all other thoughts fades from mind. Normally several thoughts run in mind in parallel as working memory is more so these thoughts not distract us but as our working memory got bad if these other thoughts come then current activity, thought get distracted. Its a coping mechanism by our mind to mitigate the low working memory issue. This not only happen during daytime but also in night during sleep. In the past we used to get dreams but that too get reduced and almost to zero due to low working memory issue. Omega 3 helps to form dreams like before thus its helps in increasing our working memory."

Anyone who was mean to you over looks is just shallow and not worth your time. And lots of people aren’t ready to be touched when they first meet someone. I’m not. I have to warm up to people first. Don’t be so hard on yourself - that’s what’s making it even harder for you. You have anxiety about being touched and then when you let people touch you before you’re ready, your anxiety goes sky high. Just say you’re not ready to hug or kiss and that you want to get to know them first. It really is ok to say/do that."
176064008,"Haldol was horrible for me. If they want to put me on that drug again they are going to have to catch me first. When I was put on Haldol they originally gave me 40mg daily. It felt horrible. Then they finally had a heart and put me on the decoate shot. It was still horrible, but not as horrible as the 40mg daily. I was on the monthly shot for a few years. They were the worst years of my life."
176064009,"Thanks man, yea i need a good support system."
174358222,"It’s not dietary protien. One of the things genes do (not all of them) is code for proteins. Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A is a ubiquitous synaptic vesicle protein that in humans is encoded by the SV2A gene. At this point it is unclear if there’s less of this synaptic protein because the schizophrenia caused synaptic loss, or the reduction in the protein caused the loss, or some other possibility."
176064010,I get some chattering but mostly the rest is gone. It’s been a huge trial and error to see what works for me. Finally I feel like things are going well.
176064011,"I think it’s a good idea to take a vacation away for a week or two; show them you are responsible and all. But, if you just leave they will perceive that in a way that would be a negative for you. It could prolong the CTO, with them saying to themselves, and each other, “see I told you so…” And then there’s this thing of keeping up on the emails, being deceptive, etc. It doesn’t have good optics. And technology being what it is, they can easily find you. If not through your email device, all the CCTV in your country may have a way of identifying you. All in all, I think running away would do more harm to you than good. I understand your frustration, and your care coordinator really should be doing a better job(maybe he needs a vacation of his own?). We call that position “case manager” here in the States, and I know they get burned out after a time; destroys their compassion and makes them apathetic to the needs of their clients. It sucks. It sucks for you, and for them. I hope you

174358224,"One paranoid delusion I had was I was being poisoned. I never was. But it’s possible I was in a past life, different parallel universe in accordance to many world’s interpretation. I still have the memories. Was it my fault? I also had the belief/thought my psychiatrist gave me a placebo or water pill for Latuda. That crap didn’t work. I thought I was being targeted electronically, but I have no evidence. I had a neurologist tell me I wasn’t schizophrenic. But the 2 MRIs must have done something negative to me. It’s common for those with similar delusions to think the MRIs unblocked memories or the barrier. So I know I’m delusional, but in a many world’s sense, I’m not because they did happen in my past lives or different lives I’ve lived in parallel universes. The problem is I remember them from a long fing time ago. I’m in a causal loop, apparently, and I still remember stuff that never happened in this worldline or timeline. Freaky, huh?"

176064052,"en.m.wikipedia.org Acting out In the psychology of defense mechanisms and self-control, acting out is the performance of an action considered bad or anti-social. In general usage, the action performed is destructive to self or to others. The term is used in this way in sexual addiction treatment, psychotherapy, criminology and parenting[citation needed]. In contrast, the opposite attitude or behaviour of bearing and managing the impulse to perform one's impulse is called acting in[citation needed]. The performed action may f..."

174358244,Are you taking any meds? Were you diagnosed with schizophrenia?
176064055,That’s my default setting. Quitters never win. Winners never quit.
174358234,"I agree with you - i still suffer the same whether i was EUPD or Sz or Depressed. The only bonus is im left alone by the welfare system with my diagnosis of schizophrenia, rather then attend medicals every other year that i had to do. I still think from time to time that the CMHT might think im making it up - but i just have to remember the psychosis i had for months before they treated me with drugs. And the end of the day - they can call my illness what the hell they like, so long as my disabilty benefits are not affected."

174358239,My Wife is very supportive and will listen when I need to talk. I found a gem in her. She will let me be with my hobby so long as I get things done around the apartment. I remember I hit rock bottom twice in my life. Schizophrenia is tough to deal with. I see commercials about helping disabled people except these are physically disabled and no mention of brain disorders or nothing. Life is not fair.

174358241,"That’s a good start though. Lack of insight is responsible for a lot of trouble when it comes to schizophrenia. To put it mildly. Your medical team are on your side. Trust me, they’re not doing these things you’re accusing them of. Your mind is playing tricks on you basically. It’s tough to swallow I know."
176064082,"Hey there. If you’re concerned about your password just talk to whoever can change it and say something along the lines of “I would like to pick a more secure password.” Absolutely don’t go in saying that your coworker is out to get you, especially without hard proof. A bit of fact checking shows that it is incredibly hard to memorize even simple passwords just by seeing it over someone’s shoulder while someone is typing it in, in fact for the average person it is very highly unlikely. Unfortunately one of the worst parts about having a psychosis related disorder is that we are immediately brushed off as being paranoid, but I want it to be known that you are heard and we are in no way trying to invalidate your concerns."

176064097,I’d be scared too so I fully understand. I need to get a back molar extracted soon as it’s been hurting crazy and I’m scared for that so I can’t imagine how traumatic it would be to have wisdom teeth removed! I’d have to be put under anaesthetic like I was when I was 20 and needed a lot of work on my teeth including an extraction. I’m terrified of dentists and unfortunately I need them a lot as my teeth are poor. Next time I go to dentist - to get my molar taken out - I will take an Ativan or diazepam to calm me and see if that helps.
176064098,Thanks!
176064099,"_AT_MENTION_ It’s a line of credit. So for example if your bank gave you a line of credit for 10,000. That means you can walk in and borrow 10,000 anytime you want no questions asked for any reason. If you have a good credit rating they will probably give you one. The interest rate is usually much less than a credit card, like 3-4 times less. 20% credit card vs 5% line of credit. So you can borrow the money from your line of credit to pay off your high interest credit card, then pay back the line of credit which has a much lower interest rate."

If its a serious business it’s good to register as a DBA (doing business as) or whatever your local/state government requires. Usually it just requires a small fee and some paperwork. Some local Chambers of Commerce set up websites to tell you what forms you need and how to remit taxes. There are sometimes even local small business support groups on Facebook that have free seminars and networking events. With my micro business I learned a lot about how hard marketing can be and how difficult it is to find dedicated people to work with you.

174358258,"I had to put this in “Unsual Beliefs” section because of the obvious… Basically, SSI isn’t enough to live on. I only have 1 work credit and I’m 30 years old. Part of this post is in jest while the other part is serious. I have a lot of trauma and stuff comparable or worse than PTSD. I don’t want to get into it. I have schizophrenia but it’s a mild case compared to the insanity I used to suffer from. I’ve often have flashbacks of memories where I was schizophrenic and hunted down for being _NAME_. I don’t know. I still feel like this is the longest I’ve lived (I’m 30 years old) in over a billion or more loops/iterations in time. I’m ??????? stuck in the year 2013 – apparently…I don’t know the exact date but it’s around the time I dropped out of college and became schizophrenic. I just want money but I realize it probably won’t happen. I believe I was abused because of my delusions and based on the fact I am _NAME_, among other people I think like _NAME_ (to be fair, 
I could have just soul swapped with him meaning I switched bodies). I have theories on why I went insane like MK-Ultra, Monarch, MiLabs (military abductions), Montauk, SSP, etc. Basically I need double or triple what I make now. Perhaps, I am a beggar or looking for sympathy or a donation lol. I was told in a past life by some people that they don’t need physical time machines anymore, but can send minds (consciousness/soul?) back in time whenever they want. Basically my life resets exactly to 2013 when I die. Happened too many times. I think a lot of scientists, PhDs, and physicists are really stupid when it comes to time travel. Perhaps, I was originally an extraterrestrial or a real human being. I think the government owes me something because they threw me in wormholes and sometimes I didn’t survive. I am fearful. I am scared and sometimes I don’t know if I’ll wake up the next night. Sometimes, I just wish this eternal loop (infinity) would just end or I could go back to my childhood before my par
ents divorced or at least have my schizophrenia cured. I can change history or better or for worse. I can change my own past and history, but I cannot do it anymore I think and that’s why they trapped me in 2013. I think they tried getting rid of me in my past lives. I was so scared between 2014-2017 in this life and my past lives. I can predict or prove some of this by predicting the future. Every time _PERSON_ loses in 2016 (election) in all my timelines or worldlines, the world goes to ???? like _NAME_ predicted during 2016 I think or 2015 at the earliest. I think the people who tried not letting him win are stupid and could have resulted in the NWO/End Times. It happened several times and it’s the possible reason we live in a computer simulation: We destroyed the planet. I was also tortured by aliens several times. I think it’s the Democrats/Deep State/Shadow Government doing this too me. If _NAME_ would have won, I probably wouldn’t be here. I lived through that life over a thousand times. I rath
er not go into the _USER_ID_ gritty. I rather not go into her personality or character, but it’s as bad as people think or worse. I often think I’m in a perpetual hell that never ends. There’s no escaping. While I may not be able to do the math required to understand these advanced theoretical concepts, I can understand the basics and even re-read and expose myself to experts like _PERSON_ books and YouTube videos and Wikipedia. Perhaps, I’m the only one who remembers this stuff. Perhaps, I’m not. But I believe each loop/iteration causes everyone’s mind to be wiped except mine. It takes years of living to figure this all out. All progress is lost when I die and I restart all over with my past life memories. I think aliens are watching us and monitoring us but I don’t know the extent. I just want to be left alone and make it to 31 years or longer and die a natural death from lung cancer in my 50’s or 60s. I thank God every day _PERSON_ won for my own safety and sake. Here are some predictions I 
came up with to add weight to this post. I hope I don’t regret this: I think it’s likely a pill form of the norovirus vaccine might temporary reduce or cure schizophrenia. I don’t know, but I have more confidence in it than anything else. Basically I am positive it’s caused by a virus. Several months ago, I had a visitation in my dreams of me being told this. In a past life, I was given two pills or something and I don’t remember much after that but I think it was the cure. I also have past life memories confirming this as well as past life conversations. If I could achieve anything in this life it is to help others and cure the most vile and evil disease out there called schizophrenia. Like a trillion lifetimes ago, we used the Iron Dome in America. In the news, they say it’s incompatible, but while I don’t know how they did it, they figured it out. It saved our butts. I felt like a kid at the time. Stuff like this makes me super paranoid and scared. I had a dream recently where I was given a f
lash drive in a distant past life or parallel universe or something, and I thought it was a video game. I went to futurism dot com and learned about tungsten bullets that the government theorized might work underwater…While we are years away from that possibility, I think it’s possible to use them from outer space or something. Perhaps, I was outside the simulation. Perhaps, some alien group showed me this and gave me this insight. I had my insanity cured by extraterrestrials in a past life. I went to _NAME_ base as a lab rat in a past life and they cured my schizophrenia, which is probably a 100+ year technology that we don’t have. A lot of time the aliens felt god-like or had god-like magic powers. I also think it’s possible the aliens gave me true insanity, which doesn’t exist. We live in a computer simulation or Matrix. I have escaped before. It was on the News in my past lives and I remember it. The Chinese will develop Wormhole Technology if not stopped. It will be used to place troops on the 
battlefield. Think teleportation or something. Inter-dimensional aliens are trying to stop this. Despite the scientists and news papers saying backwards time travel doesn’t exist, it’s harder than going forward in time, etc. I personally feel it’s easier to go backwards in time via time loops. I don’t really go forward in time unless some outside force like aliens, cloning, or something of that nature. Perhaps I should be grateful and happy with my life. There’s more to life than money. Anyways, feel free to flag if this is inappropriate. I might delete this. I am scared and nervous and testing the waters as they say to see if it’s safe. Perhaps, I’ll be viewed as a lunatic. Regarding my predictions, this may be the best I can remember right now as nothing else comes to mind. After reading all this, I have come to the conclusion while money (help) and sympathy would be nice, I rather be safe and invisible and happy and live a long life than beg for money from my own country. I never figured out 
why all this ???? happened to me in the first place in my original life. I guess it started at UC Berkeley. I guess you can call it MK-Ultra or something. I just cannot comprehend it. “Why me?” constantly crosses my mind and I feel like crying a lot of not wanting to live constantly. No body believes me which is a positive thing. I never got an explanation, I can’t remember at all why this had to happen to me at all, and that it’s unfair. They say you only die once – I even heard a montauk boy say that on YouTube, but it’s not true. We just don’t remember. I’ve died over a million or billion times or it feels like that. It could be as little as 8000 past lives. I don’t know. It never seems to end according to MWT and possibly quantum immortality. Perhaps this post is here because I want answers or closure/peace/clear-headed/freedom of speech. I want peace in my life and to be cured. Perhaps, most of all I want some validation and people to believe me, which has never hapened in 10 years. Per

At that time her husband filed for divorce and was awarded custody of the children. She didn’t even have visitation, even supervised visitation. Her brothers were able to get her alimony. Her children are now adults, and to this day refuse to speak to her."

176064150,"I am taking my meds religiously yeap… We tried many in the past and 4 years ago, my pdoc said to stop switching them, so i take my zyprexa every day since 4 years… Maybe i was a hard case, cause i was ill since kid, while i took meds later in my life… I was diagnosed with conversion disorder and i wonder if the zyprexa will help on this… I still believe a bit, that i have these physical symptoms because of my psychosis… But i still feel crazy, alone, boring, but i was alone for 20 years before… Now that i am trying to change, i worry about the fact that i still feel ill and i get these physical symptoms . Maybe in my case, i really will need years to get better? And i should stop worrying about the times where i feel weak and just bad? Yeah, the docs said to not stop my meds in any case now lol… I dont stop them nope…"
176064151,"I don’t think you have social phobia, are you experiencing fear and anxiety? With my old friend I could see him getting stressed, fearful, and anxious when around many ppl. He sweats and his pupils dilate like in fight-or-flight mode with adrenaline rush. His voice stutters and is low in intensity from fear. Anyways talk about it with your psychiatrist and tell us if you have social phobia."
176064152,yea i have autism and sz so it’s hard to say sometimes what comes from my sz or autism. i also avoid people… a friend from in the army tries to phone me sometimes but i find it really hard talking on the phone so i been ignoring him and i feel bad about that sometimes but i rather be on my own… weird huh.
174358257,I socialize kind of ok. I just stay cognizant that certain people aren’t interested in talking. I also don’t try to get too close to people because I know if they know I’m in a group home there will be problems.
176064153,"Thank you, but I’m not sure how I can break my negativity and give myself a chance. I can allow people to get to know me, but I’m 100% sure that they’re going to reject me outright when I tell them that I suffer from psychosis. I want to do good in this world and make people happy, but I don’t have to be happy. I don’t deserve it, and people probably won’t care. Even there are microaggressions happening within my family, who are supposed to protect me and love me. I’m hiding a secret from my brother as if my illness is shameful, and my parents instruct me to stay silent. _USER_ID_ is real and there’s no way that I can combat it. I think people should be treated respectfully and politely, and everyone deserves love and compassion. But not me. People don’t care about people like me. My wish is that everyone with sz is respected and loved, but that’s not happening anywhere at this point. No matter how much I tell people that we are not dangerous, people still post weird ???? on the 
Internet whenever there is a murder by sz person. Plus, I’m Asian; people think that we’re coronavirus at this point so there’s a high chance that I will be targeted outside of Korea. I don’t give myself a chance because I know I won’t be offered a chance. People already have their minds made up in _USER_ID_, and I can’t change them. So instead, I just hate myself in return. I mean, it would be great if I could love myself and trust others, but I don’t know how I can do that. It seems like putting a wall between other people and myself would be the safest choice. I don’t want to be hurt ever again. Meeting new people increases the chance of getting hurt, and I’m tired of getting hurt by others."
176064154,"You may do well then, since that was so long ago. The best treatment for anxiety I know of is fresh ionized alkaline water. 9.5 pH, -500 ORP (oxidation reduction potential, stress _NAME_) and it’s super hydrating, so an hour after drinking it, it feels like your brain is having a chill bath. Regular tap water doesn’t compare! Helps your brain actually heal, as well, since by reducing the oxidative stress it’s being subjected to, your brain can work on healing itself rather than just being inflamed (the inflammation is hard to feel since the brain lacks pain receptors.) IMO this helps tremendously with stability. I’ve used it for 2 months to very good effect (my voices transitioned from constant mumbles I could converse with, to just “off”.)"
176064155,"cheers dude, good luck!"
174358274,Abilify didn’t work for me. I’m currently on risperidone 3x day. It helps. I’ve had ECT 3 separate series for depression.
174358268,"I believe I had a mania recently. Suddenly, I was able to work for 12 hours at a time from home for days at a time (3-4 weeks) along with feeling extremely paranoid and anxious. Those energy levels have disappeared again now. So I’m wondering, was this mania, and do schizophrenics get these, or is it just bipolar people?"

176064157,"Just got back from the gym! My trainer is amazing. She keeps reminding me to take breaks and get water, and the result is that I get a decent workout, but don’t feel exhausted afterward. In the past, I’ve had a problem with always pushing myself to the absolute limit for a few months, then that would trigger eating issues, and then I would drop like 40 lbs but be pale and shaky. I think this new style of working out is much more sustainable and less triggering. I might be able to maintain a decent level of fitness and still eat. Speaking of eating, time to make lunch!"
176064158,"I was in choir, drama and I played tennis. On the weekends my brother, my classmates, some older friends and I would all dress up and reenact the Rocky Horror Picture Show in front of the theater where it played. I never did any school work except for creative writing. I graduated by exam when I was 15. After that I used to go back and hang out at lunchtime in the smoking section playing my guitar and singing for the younger kids who all thought I was some kind of Goddess for getting out of there so young. I don’t know if that’s positive or negative. It seemed pretty fun at the time."

176064162,delusions of reference? make sure you tell the doc this.
174358266,As some of you know my dad just as myself has schizophrenia… Lately he has sounded sane when he’s texted and sounded as if he had some sort of reason in his head so I ask him if he was on meds he said no I asked if he’s been in the hospital lately he said not lately I then begged him to start meds and he refused saying he don’t hallucinate anymore and that he likes sex more than sanity I begged him again and he said to drop it I told him I missed and will always respect and love the man he use to be he than typed nonsense and I said good night and started to cry… I miss my dad… I don’t remember what he use to be but I’ve heard stories… He use to be a good man and I wish I grew up with that but I can’t remember that far back
174358262,I sincerely appreciate the reference but I looked it up and it’s in the same class as Latuda and Abilify. I cannot take those. They induce ehat is similar to Parkinsonism…but thank you.

I guess I’m looking to become equal with the normies or something but I should be content with what I have. Maybe I am equal with the normies, and greed drives my will to add medicines… to eclipse them. Well it backfired and I felt tired/groggy/unclear yesterday. Today I feel normal again.

176064187,"Well I’ll take that as a compliment. I have been dealing with this with no medication for so long and it’s been so f’ing difficult. I’m proud of myself for the most part, but I think I’m as far as I can get without meds. I used to be really against medication in general, but I have to try something new, because my old tactics aren’t working for me anymore. And you’re right. It’s best not to sit and try to dwell on anything or try to figure anything out. Just have to keep pushing forward."
174358278,"It took a while but my meds help me function to a good level. I don’t work but I live a rich and realized life that matters to me and it’s a great life. I’m not complaining. I’ve been through similar as many here have. I guess I got to a point where getting more positive and into the so called real world mattered more to me than worry about what I went through. Yeah. I believed and experienced some really out there stuff and honestly I can’t see that it wasn’t what it was but I’m well enough to see that it was how my brain was operating at the time and it all points to schizophrenia. Coming to this website in 1999 ( well the old website it was then ) really was an eye opener. I learned about symptoms and how I wasn’t alone. For example. For a bit there I thought I was Jesus. Coming here I found others who were in the same boat…as the old Dire Straits song goes…Two people think they’re Jesus, one of them must be wrong."

Instead of hiking through those windy mountain trails we went back “as the crow flies”and went back by wading a few miles through a river. Anyways we went around some rocks and we couldn’t believe our eyes, there were ladybugs covering these huge rocks. Like millions of them.

On meds I had the least negative symptoms on partial dopamine agonists like Abilify so you’re already on the best for negative symptoms.

174358293,My mother called me a liar for years - when i said i probably had sz. This was before i was diagnosed mind you - but i already knew i had it. It was the only diagnosis that fitted - and not the EUPD crap that got shoved down my throat for years. It took an episode of psychosis witnessed by a psych doctor to confirm it finally. She only believed me - when i showed my clinic letter saying “Schizophrenia (F20) in relapse” . She was genuinly shocked. After that - we have a much better understanding of each other now.

An improvement in the Calgary Depression Scale, Simpson-_NAME_ Scale, and Visual Analogue Scale (_NAME_) will also be observed. This scales were been used during the baseline, 3 months after, and then, 6 months.Subjects, after 6-month treatment with amisulpride and quetiapine, did show statistically significant differences in the assessed areas: WAIS Coding Subtest (P < 0.001), CTMT A and B (CTMT A P < 0.034; CTMT B P < 0.000), and Stroop Tests: Word (P < 0.001), Word-Color (P < 0.007), and Interference (P < 0.039).

176064283,"Hypnagogic hallucinations are often auditory or have an auditory component. Like the visuals, hypnagogic sounds vary in intensity from faint impressions to loud noises, like knocking and crash and bangs (exploding head syndrome). People may imagine their own name called, crumpling bags, white noise, or a doorbell ringing. Snatches of imagined speech are common. While typically nonsensical and fragmented, these speech events can occasionally strike the individual as apt comments on—or summations of—their thoughts at the time. They often contain word play, neologisms and made-up names. Hypnagogic speech may manifest as the subject’s own “inner voice”, or as the voices of others: familiar people or strangers. More rarely, poetry or music is heard.[15] en.m.wikipedia.org Hypnagogia Hypnagogia, also referred to as ""hypnagogic hallucinations"", is the experience of the transitional state from wakefulness to sleep: the hypnagogic state of consciousness, during the onset of sleep (for the transi

176064298,"I don’t know much about hybrids but before you buy a used car you should take it to a reliable mechanic and have him thoroughly examine it. A car may look OK on the outside but there may be hidden damage or mechanical or engine problems that a trained mechanic can spot that you couldn’t. I had first hand experience of this when I bought a car in 1997. It was a 1985 Toyota that I thought was fine when I looked at it and test drove it. I bought it for $2000 and I drove it around for a few months in summer and everything was fine but when winter came and it rained there was a leak somewhere around the windshield that the previous owners had not told me about and huge puddles would form on the floor of the interior every time it rained. My ex-brother-in-law who worked as a mechanic tried to find where it was leaking and fix it but he was never able to find the leak. And not only that but we had the hood open and we were checking out the engine one day and he suddenly announced that the car had been 
in a major accident. He saw that part of the frame was a replacement meaning that the previous owners had taken out part of the frame to fix it because of major structural damage and then welded on new steel. I would never have discovered that on my own in a million years but he had been mechanic for years so he was able to spot it. If you buy a car off the lot at most major car dealerships they will give you a Carfax report which gives the entire history of the car including how many previous owners there were and what repairs had been done and any accidents it had been in. I don’t know if you can get a Carfax report while buying a car from a private party. I bought my 2012 Volkswagen from a dealership and Volkswagens are sturdy, reliable cars but when it needed repairs my mechanic groaned and said, “_NAME_, why couldn’t you have bought a Camry?” Volkswagens are hard cars to work on, cars like Camry’s are easier to work on so you might want to take that into consideration. Because like it or not, w
hen you have a car, most likely it’s going to need repairs at some point, especially older cars. But yeah, before you buy it take it to a reputable mechanic and pay him the $50 or a $100 to thoroughly inspect it and see if anything’s wrong with it. Toyotas are usually good cars, its a major make of car. A car is a big investment and you don’t want any surprises when you shell out the money for one. You want to know what you’re getting into when you buy one."

Maybe it’s because I’ve heard the “You’ll change your mind when you’re older” or “ Well you never know” crap for sooo long that it makes me think maybe I really don’t know myself and I second guess my decision. I found myself subconsciously doing this exercise. Every so often I imagine what the steps to having a kid would look like and then I decide one by one if I could do them: Make appointment to remove my IUD? Time with SO? Buy a pregnancy test? Then I get to the part where I think about letting a human develop inside of me and my brain absolutely nopes tf out of that scenario. Soooo that’s a big? I’m pretty queer and the thought of child bearing just makes me feel sooooo uncomfortably feminine and I hate it. Sometimes I even try to skip the pregnant part in my mind in case its the pregnancy that freaks me out. I mean pregnancy is temporary after all, maybe it’d be worth it. 
So then I try to imagine SO and I caring for a baby. Feeding it and making sure it sleeps well and is happy and I just- I dunno. It sounds messed up but my gut tells me I’d be absolutely miserable raising a kid. So then I check my “still definitely don’t want kids” box off and make sure my birth control is still doing all the things it needs to. This exercise helps confirm that I know myself well enough to know parenthood insn’t for me. Do you guys ever do anything like this or is it just me? What do your check ins look like? Sorry this was so long winded for no real reason."

Nobody is going to piece it together and be able to help you all that much. I fantasize about the flick Citizen _NAME_ and the whole investigation that occurs after he passes with cryptic last words. You prob don’t know the flick but my own personal ‘_PERSON_’ is just like I wanted to entertain. Maybe check the flick out? A lot of people like it very much!
176064364,well the snow finally packed and I got to build a huge ball of snow in the front yard…I was out of breath afterwards…haha what a work out !! other than that it was just our typical eggaritos for breakfast and not much else…went to the store again…
176064365,Thanks very much _AT_MENTION_ i guess youre fan of the Moomins… I was raised reading the moomins and loved them very much. It’s a magic universe.
176064366,I will see if my dr will do that
174358319,I quit Invega back on December. I began to feel better after 6 months off. But I also began to have positive symptoms so I asked my doctor for a different injection. He prescribed Aristada and it’s been amazing. I am more motivated and clear headed.

176064370,Story #2- A man with a brilliant mind who was too poor to go to college was working his way up through the ranks of a Fortune 500 company until they demoted him for not having a college degree. Story #3- A man created a restaurant that became famous World-wide but lost it to the pandemic. He and all of his employees who had worked all their lives became homeless. Meanwhile a guy at the bottom of the heap thanked God for a roof over his head because he received money from the government even though he had never worked. (even though I am on SSI I can see this as an injustice.)

176064372,"I’ve been working on my good ass for years. The other Freudians escaped me. Because if you can’t defend your ass, you’ll never be happy. People love to ridicule and scold asses from a very early age. Even the way one’s mother changes our diapers affects us. I still remember somebody yelling “Your in the house.” after I let a fart. If that’s the extent of my criminal record I figure I’m doing ok."

174358321,"I’ve been having auditory hallucinations, should I be concerned that it will turn into full blown commentary and not just laughing a shrieking? I’m 5 weeks on clozapine, and 3 weeks off of Invega sustenna. My pdoc said depending on how I do while off of the Invega, it might need to be reinstated, or another AP. That is why I have to see her every month, I see her this week. My concentration isn’t that good. Experiences feel flat, and I don’t get enjoyment or laughter from funny things, and I’m always asking people to repeat themselves. I don’t know how to get increased awareness. Would Invega sustenna help with that and hallucinations? The clozapine I’m on now just mellows me out and regulates my mood"
176064376,"I also have negative and cognitive symptoms. I only get out of bed to eat and shower every 7-9 days. My parents get my med and food. I feel mentally disabled. I started hearing voices at 16-17 y.o. I also had catatonia at the beginning of my SZ. I still have mild catatonia where I freeze but it happens less and its less intense. Before my SZ, I wanted to be a doctor and I had the grades to."
176064377,I have no idea maybe _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ or _AT_MENTION_ can tell you. Just click on the same box where you muted and click on “normal”. I just did it myself. It’s under topic controls at the bottom of the thread Reply Normal You will be notified if someone mentions your _AT_MENTION_ or replies to you.
176064378,My delusions are better than any normie I’ve ever met.
176064379,"I really struggle with avolition, as well. I’ve applied for a few part-time jobs to see if that will help. Of course, I apply for jobs during the day when I’m extremely bored, but when I get contacted by the employer, I chicken out and tell them I’m unable to work."
176064380,I don’t hallucinate. I am not in psychosis at the moment. I sleep well.
176064381,"Mom’s been moved into a room, and now we need to see about hooking the phone up in her room. I’ve got some downtime after lunch right now before work and I will head up to the hospital after supper and hook it up, if it hasn’t been done already."
176064382,Perhaps we believe in different things… Do people consider kundalini awakening unicorns as well? There must be a line drawn here…
176064383,"I’ve only ever heard sirens myself, and only a few times. Delusions were the symptom that got me my diagnosis."

176064385,My life would be Survivor.
176064386,Yes but oddly enough no one has schizophrenia. At least that we know of.
176064387,"My sleep schedule had been great for several months, but now it’s back to sucking. I am going to bed at anywhere from 1:00 am, and I’m waking up at 4- 4:30 am every single night. I wish I could get a good night’s rest."
176064388,There is the possibilty of a food interaction. For instance if you eat foods or take supplements that interfere with for instance dopamine or serotonin it could cancel the effects of the Ap’s. It has happened to me. If you can remember if you started eating something different or starting a new supplement at the time that could be it.
176064389,"I am 6.1, 185 lbs, so not to bad for my age, i would like to be 175"

176064394,No dreams but fears it would happen again even though I too have not had an episode since 2010. My psychiatrist feels it left me with ptsd

176064398,Our feelings can be really hurtful when we are tired that rest helps with all the problems we have and our outlook on them.
176064399,Get my pdoc to prescribe topiramate now that I’m off lithium. It would help with bipolar and causes weight loss. I see him next week.
176064400,Thanks mate. I don’t read off forum content and like a summary. Appreciate your work!

176064402,There are many companies that hire people with autism nowadays. It is all the inclusion and diversity initiatives that companies do now. So you have plenty of opportunities.
176064403,"I swear like a flaming Trooper when im in a bad mood or having a bad day. Ive got a terrible habit of launching my mobile at the wall after crappy calls from my mother. One day i even scared my poor nieghbour upstairs - i was murderous. Since the meds tho - ive mellowed out significantly, but the CMHT has had many a voicemail from me cursing them and calling them a bunch of CU Next Tuesdays - when ive been irate. But they know when im like that - its for a good reason like no sleep or been piss _NAME_ off by the voices and or im due my depot. Nice guy Usually! lol"
176064404,I’m worried because I feel like my delusions are realistic unlike others here. Does anyone else think mine are realistic? Like the North Korea one? It’s something that can possibly happen.
176064405,"Yes. But all my crises happen to me when no help is available. So I’m stuck with it, temporarily. Of course, I always come crawling to the forum for sympathy."

176064409,That sounds really good. What do you call an “episode”.
176064410,anyone taking modafinil along with AP for narcolepsy ? is this a right combination ?

176064415,"So, what’s it to you? Music is innocent. There are a lot of more destructive things lonely people do to themselves. Music is a relatively safe haven."
176064416,"Yeah, I go in and out of psychosis and find myself not being able to do basic things just like you’re going through right now. It’s gets better, try to tell yourself that things are unlikely or not possible and that when your brain feels fear it accidentally connects everything you perceive into a knot with the fear and then you are paranoid … it might help a little bit? Then decipher what is plausible and what is coincidence. It is very unlikely anybody is thinking of you, let alone wanting to speak badly of you ! You haven’t done anything wrong!"
176064417,I don’t notice anything when I take a Wellbutrin but if I forget to take one I really notice. Of course if I forget that I also forgot my morning dose of Geodon which is equally and doubly bad. It’s probably just a placebo effect.
176064418,The mentally ill are prone to using drugs including nicotine and alcohol. With that said the only drug I was addicted to was nicotine years ago.
176064419,"That’s exactly the issue. I do not think that many thoughts about doing stuff are a crucial part of doing that stuff, any ordinary activity can be successfully attempted either with or without such thoughts, many things even more successfully without them, which suggests to me it is rather counterproductive to doing it unlike actual trying. If someone fails to do something, it is not because he or she did not think enough about doing it (although failure may be due to not thinking enough about how to do it, as in planning, but that would be a cognitive issue). It follows that spending more thought on something is not moving anyone closer to successfully doing it, so it can hardly be called part of trying. I’m not saying there are no serious problems of overthinking and procrastinating etc. It is just not a case of trying very hard but somehow not being able to. Thinking of doing something does not make it likelier for it to happen, as trying would, and is therefore not part of trying. If i woul
d think about raising my hand and it happened i would be quite surprised. This was helpful to me at times perhaps to some others too."
176064420,"I know people who smoked weed @ 5 years old and were doing heroin by 11. That was when weed was highly illegal. I’d say there’s a bigger thrill for thrill seekers in doing something illegal for everyone, than just illegal for underage people. I’m sorry you’ve had such bad experiences with weed. It’s not for everyone obviously. But it is helpful for a lot of people and it’s a humans rights issue imo to let people consume what they want rather than locking them up/arresting them /ruining their lives. There are millions of people in Alcoholics Anonymous. We just now need a marijuana anonymous now for ex-reefer addicted/bothered people. My 10 cent opinion. But yeah."
176064421,That sounds rough. I’m really glad you’re still with us and doing so well now
176064422,"Good luck, I stopped meds once with the help of my psychiatrist, I ended up in mental hospital after 1-2 years but I was psychotic during all that time. It was a disaster as I nearly damaged my life permanently."
176064423,that i was very different then them.they couldnt handle me and they thought that i was so different.
176064424,That sounds really healthy! Good luck!
176064425,"I make jokes about my psychosis often on my blog and no one comments anything rude back to me. I share the sz memes from this site because I find them hilarious and they tell our story well. Fortunately because of my medication my hallucinations are not bad lately. I thought I saw _NAME_ and _PERSON_ drive past me yesterday. My unmedicated psychosis had a few comical moments, looking back, but they were outnumbered by frightening and tragic moments."
176064426,"It’s bothering me a little. The bathroom fan is triggering it. At first it was music, which I’ve had before quite a few times and bothers a little but isn’t too scary but it morphed into demonic voices and I started hearing them say I’m a piece of sh it and should die. That bothered me a lot and scared me. But I know it’s not real and I’m able to shake it off and so far the only thing I’ve heard outside of the bathroom is a sound coming from the phone on the hook. That’s happened to me before also. I think I’m a little stressed about my daughter."
176064427,Sounds like you might need an appointment with an ear doctor to sort out your hearing
176064428,"Here’s a snippet from the beginning: I could hear the voices of the vampires, faint, heading in the direction of the gas station I’d run from. The sky had had that faint tinge of pinky-orange that promises sunrise when I stopped for gas. The area was so rural that I didnt think any vampires would be skulking about. Usually you run into feral wolf packs, not bloodsuckers, out here in the country. My feet left channels through the leaves as I half walked, half stumbled through the trees. Undergrowth choked the old logging road I had entered the forest on. Briars played hell on my legs. Next time I went for a drive I would remember to keep a bug-out bag with me at all times. One stocked with all sorts of vampire killin goodies. Maybe a peanut-butter Snickers or two. Those things rock. Fighting vampires makes you hungry. Judge not, lest ye be judged and all that."
176064429,"I used to take Daily Essential Nutrients and Amyloban 3399 with Haldol 2 mg. I ran out of the first, and I’m falling apart. I shouldn’t order my bottles 1 month apart. Should order my replacement bottle as soon as I get my initial order, so I always have 2 bottles. Other things I take are sometimes Turmeric with Bioperine, Aleve, Tylenol. Anti-inflammatories and a painkiller. Also take Vitamin K2-MK7 for tooth sensitivity and lower back pain, it’s the bone remineralizing vitamin."
176064430,no I basically live under a rock and haven’t heard of such things. but thanks for the info. I will look into it.
176064431,"Interesting to know, thanks"
176064432,"I know you like like the idea of therapy, but… Therapy."
176064433,"i have asus and it works perfectly. I had a HP laptop which was good, but keyboard started to malfunction. I heard MSi is a good brand also. I would choose between those 3"
174358329,Is Abilify the only ap you take? If you don’t mind me asking.
176064434,"To answer the threat title question. I think so, yes."
176064435,"Only took the half dose the second day, then continued with 300mg onwards. I am getting used to the seroquel the next day, today I felt like myself, instead of like a zombie which I felt like after the first dose the next day."
176064436,I think the best thanks is to just maintain your own wellness so you’re not paranoid or hostile… at least that’s probably what my mom would say if I asked her. It makes things 100x easier for her.
176064437,I don’t suggest you to get marry if you are not too interesting in it. You live for yourself not for your family. Follow your heart and do something that you enjoy and relax.
176064438,I actually sometimes feel like I’m a some body even though I’m a nobody and that the universe is geared towards ignoring me or protecting me sometimes. Does that make any sense?
176064439,"It is totally possible to get pregnant while taking meds. Many people on the forum have happy, healthy children."
176064440,like i am developing turrets for my brain and illnesses if it just werent broadcasting id be perfectly normal i dont like the idea of my thoughts being exposed like that.

176064443,I’m going for a second opinion (recommended by current pdoc). The new provider is a younger guy meaning atleast less than 45 by appearance. My main pdoc who I do not like speaking with basically bashed the group he is with and explained most of the team are NPs and don’t have a doctorate like her. She also discounts my side effects from Seroquel and said I read about them and then I guess manifested them through anxiety. Tell that to my chipped teeth from lock jaw and ongoing twitching. Anyway what are your experiences with “young gun” pdoc
176064444,Its mostly kids who have them but its no fault if u have them as adult. No one has mentioned rabbits they are Nice.
176064445,"Yes, I got caught up on my sleep yesterday. That always helps me. Thanks"

176064449,"If you corporate and show them you can be trusted with meds , it might be an option in future for you to switch… i was given meds , I took them as prescribed for a 5 years… at this point when I asked if I could make changes to the meds they also helped me in making those decisions"
176064450,"You’ll likely not relapse, meds either work or don’t the first time. Just don’t get off them because they might not work again after."
174358330,If it continues report it to your psychiatrist. Constipation is a side effect of Clozapine and can be dangerous if left untreated.
176064451,"who said that? and no, the very statement that your using to downplay your delusions says that you have delusions."
176064452,Mine asked me which med I want to be on and I said Risperdal. Its been the best med I have tried out of 5 antipsychotics. When I was first diagnosed they put me on Risperdal for a couple of days and stopped it bcz of eyelid tremors. This time no tremors on 4mg.
176064453,Who’s there with you that you’re not alone?
176064454,You’re only given a little spark of madness. One mustn’t lose it. ~_NAME_~
176064455,yes i think so 15151
176064456,what makes the earth rotate is uniqueness because each person is unique that is super special no person has the same past a finger print is unique too
176064457,"Um, definitely something wrong if you wound up in a psych ward. Suggest working through the process. There were many times I thought I wasn’t psychotic, but this was exactly the case. You can’t get any more textbook psychotic than this. Sorry. Hope you’ll work with your treatment team to get your head back on straight. Getting treatment early in psychosis leads to much better outcomes."
176064458,I’m retrying the Lamictal also. Good luck with it!
176064459,I’m on 3 AP’s and I’m doing great.
176064460,Yeah woke up this morning and felt like I got hit by a truck!
176064461,"In the hospital, they aren’t usually concerned unless you can clearly see the pill in the vomit. But that’s just my experience. The only issue is that if you throw latuda up, it won’t be fully absorbed in your system because it needs to be taken with so many calories. So because it’s your latuda, I would be worried about it fully getting into your system if you are throwing up. Definitely talk to your doctor."
176064462,"But its possible to improve the dopamine receptors in prefrontal cortex by avoiding pleasure giving activities, lazy ones etc. Instead do hard to do things like solving puzzles, learning new things etc. These hard to do things make use of prefrontal cortex more while when we do lazy pleasure giving ones prefrontal cortex hardly used."
176064463,"I took NAC 600 mg yesterday, now i feel a little anti depressant effect I should up my dose to twice 600 mg like the minocycline study don’t you guys think?"
176064464,"I’ve never read a not good poem on here before. What makes what you wrote not good? Maybe you are just being too hard on yourself, idk."
176064465,Bring books with you. Bring coloring. Bring puzzles. Bring something to be occupied with
176064466,I’ve had 7 pulled at once and it wasn’t awful. The week following is a little bit like hell.
176064467,"My sleep patterns are truly abnormal. Sometimes I sleep as long as 11 hours or more. Other times, I don’t sleep at all, or, I only sleep around 4 or 5 hours. Like last night, I slept 5 hours. And I’m supposed to go to Mass this morning. How can I? On only 5 hours of sleep?"
176064468,I don’t know. The last job I got knew I was mentally ill and hired me anyway. Prior to that I hid my disability in “relocation” and in taking time off to “raise my family”. I guess I will just be honest and say I have a disability that I’ve recovered from. I can’t think of any other way to disguise it. An eight year gap is hard to explain.
174358335,"Latuda worked for me last year, but I skipped some doses and it almost completely stopped working. Now I’m stuck with voices every day with invega"
176064469,"LOL that’s what you think while you are non psychotic, when you are psychotic, the old delusions are very likely to come back and you would want to kill your foster parents or something again"

174358333,"Have you tried abilify? There’s some evidence to suggest it doesn’t suffer from this effect of stopping working. “tachyphylaxis” means it stops working. A fancy way of saying pooping out. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Aripiprazole may be free from tachyphylaxis: preliminary findings. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences , Mar 2012 Loss of antipsychotic efficacy (tachyphylaxis), possibly linked to an increase in D? receptor number and sensitivity, is a significant impediment to treatment in chronic schizophrenia patients. Animal studies, however, suggest that aripiprazole may be free from tachyphylaxis. The aim of the present study was to investigate this hypothesis. In this preliminary study, aripiprazole-treated patients were retrospectively investigated for the presence or absence of tachyphylaxis. Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores did not significantly change and there was no significant association of CGI scores with fixed dose duration
. This suggests that aripiprazole may be free from tachyphylaxis."
174358346,Why not ditch invega or risperdal and just take abilify instead?
176064472,"I have no motivation for anything. All I do and wanna do is sleep, eat and sit in my recliner watching TV and movies all the time. I get really bad anhedonia from Invega Sustenna injections that I get every month. Nothing is ever enjoyable for me. I’m just surviving day to day."

No change in diet or exercise, just got the ???? off that useless drug. My bipolar 16 year old was on 20mg for 5 years, we went down to 15mg a few months back, weight is coming off. He also decided no more ritalin, so he’s trying to go off all meds.

But once they are between 6-10 their bodies and brains are constantly growing and they’re just so sassy and full of energy. It scares me how angry I can get at someone so little even if I don’t show it to them. Some of them are really good at pushing the wrong buttons. And teenagers, I feel it’s either hit or miss. So many of them seem like entitled dramatic know-it-alls. I’m on a chat server where there’s a lot of teenagers, and you have no idea who many depressed 14-year olds I’ve encountered who just happen to know they’ve got the worst depression in the entire world and they’re the only person to ever exist who has 0% chance of ever feeling better, ever.

176064487,"Thanks, hon. Coming from you, that’s a huge compliment."
174358341,I didn’t like invega. I switched from invega to abilify. Invega is considered a stronger med I think. Sure seemed stronger to me anyway. Made me numb. No pleasure in things. And really felt medicated on it.
176064488,Its definitely not only you but many of us schiz. I’m slowly working my way down to zero friends.
176064489,lol haha you guys make laugh lol
176064490,Yeah can relate. I thought way too much before meds. My brain never shut off and just kept going. I really did have racing thoughts for a long time but now age and meds I don’t do so bad. Sz is a disorder of introspection. It really is. With meds for most though you can move forwards. You learn your symptom set and move from there.
176064491,5 years 1 year left
176064492,"Welcome back, _AT_MENTION_ !!"
176064493,Yes
176064494,I can’t go into big cities and I can no longer go to shopping malls
176064495,Off of .5mg? I workout 3 hours after I take one.
176064496,How much did you take?
176064497,"Wow, I’m batting a 1000; that’s the second time I’ve heard that in just the last ten minutes."
176064498,Often people with sz/sza think that everyone hates them. That’s a common paranoid delusion.
176064499,"A month is like 4 weeks and a half, the Dr said its enough. Also it was making me angry and slightly paranoid. Actually I was on it for 5 weeks."
176064500,People only want you for what good you can do to them. When you are in trouble it´s hard to get help but that same person will call you immediately when they need it because they know you are stupid enough to forget. They make us feel undervalued.
176064501,Everytime I peer at the clock. It’s 11.11. Yeah classic ideas of reference.
174358343,Congratulations! I wish!
176064502,"I stopped meds for 2yrs. Now on meds I am almost always in bed and never go out of the house, a couple of times a year."
176064503,"Some people arent quitting they are paying the price and buying illegal, hoping the ban on cigs will be lifted soon."
176064504,I feel that way a lot. Even when on medicine. But my medicine isn’t working. Supposed to start new stuff in five days.
176064505,is that you a plumber now then chordy? lol
176064506,Have holy basil tea it will calm your mind.
176064507,My voices are the only reason I had delusions. Now that they are gone I don’t have any. _USER_ID_; they also ran their course and I figured out that they were not real
176064508,I see that makes sense
176064509,The med’s are a fact for me. I know what happens when I don’t take them.
174358345,I think that Abilify caused aggressive behavior in me Is that possible? I know it’s supposed to treat it but is the opposite possible? I feel irritated often since starting it
176064510,"Yes,I will block the soldier on facebook but I would like to talk to him to know if it was true everything that was happening then. Yes I believe in the military drones because of my experience"
176064511,Hi _AT_MENTION_ I hope you have a wonderful day too honey.
176064512,"I can’t even manage money or live on my own, I have addiction issues. Are you able to manage your own money and have a bank account? My parents receive all my disability money directly into their bank account."
176064513,Yeah ive gotten trouble for not working. I ger ssi so I do contribute to household expenses.
176064514,"_AT_MENTION_ I think you’re on the right track. It takes a bit of practice, but once it becomes natural it really does help. Or at least it has done wonders for me"
176064515,I figure internet dating is broken anyway and it is not worth the time.
174358354,"That I’m not sure about. Each med works different for each person. And each person has different symptoms. You just have to give it a try and see if it works for you. I know it’s hard and time consuming to try different meds but you never really know until you try it for yourself. But typically an ap doesn’t treat depression, mania and paranoia. The exception I know of is Rexulti, which seems to do good on depression."
176064516,"Well, do your freakout maneuvers - a cup of tea, some soothing music, meditation. Do you have any pets?"
176064517,Not sure of the meds but can be difficult going back on them after coming off them…You may need bigger doses to feel same result. Still. Your doc should be in the know about that so keep in contact and hang in there…These meds can affect you pretty weirdly and often there’s no rhyme or reason to it.
176064518,"Same here is like momentary tonal Tinnitus which can send a sharp shabbing pain through my ear canel, would this be what you are discribing here."
176064519,"I used to imagine music videos too, there’s something about the music that stirs the visuals in me."
176064520,"So very sorry, _AT_MENTION_ . This has to be so difficult. Many cyber hugs."
176064521,"Welcome, dear, I miss you! Hugs"
176064522,I never wanted to rule the world…I just wanted my simple life back…
176064523,"They’re evil. It’s too bad you can’t move. I’ve always had evil people, who want to run my life. They’re obsessed with proving they’re normal, at the expense of innocent people, because they can’t get what they want legally."
176064524,Thank you all?? I followed a tutorial and it’s definitely the best eye I’ve done.
176064525,"I see. With 15mg, i would feel sedated"
176064526,I just plotted an X^2 graph and an X^3 graph if that counts just plotting my x and y coordinates
176064527,"I did some research here not to long ago, title ‘students with disabilities’. I found some suggestions adaptable to work accommodations, like asking for more breaks, able to walk out if symptoms persist, have someone check up on you, and one I personally made, if I can’t function at work simply leave earlier and not get punished for it."

174358357,"Hello, I am new here. I am not new to Schizophrenia. However, I feel on top of the world right now. I don’t think it is a delusion either. I just passed my Praxis 5018 (Teacher Content Exam). I am going to student teach soon. This was 15 years in the making. I make it look easy with a 3.62 gpa. Sometimes my disorganized thinking happens with kids and they look at me funny. I always correct myself with some struggle. I wish I didn’t have this illness but I do think it will help others out. Always a silver lining. My mentor for years, just told me she has an eating disorder and I opened up to her about my scattered thinking. She nodded and gave me a hug. I am so lucky to have her in my life. I do not think I would be a teacher without mentors like her. I pray that I get a Student Teacher Host some time next spring for the spring class. I really want to be done and have a job after this. Not just a substitute. For now I work at my childhood school in _NAME_. Yay!!! I have the privilege to call my 
mentor a coworker too. I truly am an understudy. Who knows maybe my BA in Education with E.L.L credentials will happen?"
176064531,That sounds delish you got my mouth watering
176064532,"My mom has had delusional disorder for probably around 7 years now. She never had negative symptoms, just a belief that her sister-in-law was spying on her through her phone. Nothing super out of the ordinary and we believed her for a few years as well. It has never progressed into hallucinations or anything like that (that I was aware of) and she has never received treatment for it. She is extremely high functioning, etc. Well, as her 22-year-old son, I’ve always been fearful of developing her mental illness or even schizophrenia. I do suffer a few mental illnesses myself, such as depression, OCD, anxiety, and I think my OCD has made me really anxious about developing psychosis. My sister is 28 and hasn’t shown any signs of developing psychosis but we both have an unfortunate history of drug use (cannabis, MDMA, amphetamines, LSD, alcohol). I think at this point I’m just waiting for the delusions/hallucinations to start."
174358359,I have a hard time picturing what life would be like without schizophrenia. I think I would be married and have kids. I think I would have a full time job and maybe have my own house or apartment. I’m not sure what else.
176064533,"thanks wave! yea i got lucky i found this really great singer on a relatively small website, but the vocals fit perfectly…what a fluke!"
176064534,I have very bad anxiety allowing people in my home.
176064535,Good luck _PERSON_!
176064536,Haha _PERSON_… I was really out of it.
176064537,what dose you on?
176064538,"ceilings are hard, my arms always get so tired, good luck sweetie, have a good day"
176064539,I think _AT_MENTION_ is wise. As are the mods on here. But I think everyone is intelligent in their own way.
176064540,"Hmmmm… its peculiar that its the opposite for some ppl. I guess it all depends on the individual. Maybe the progression of illness in terms of order of sumptoms plsy a role? For me, it was first wrong thoughts, then delusion, then extreme paranoia, then hallucinations. Like a stack of pancakes cumulating. The older, weaker stacks seemed easier to treat for me."
176064541,It is good If you r on diet it can’t stop you from losing weight
176064542,"More serotonin helps me with the voices, but I don’t always get the feeling"
176064543,Lol I wake up to yelling voices right when falling asleep sometimes. Or I can’t help but keep talking with my thoughts really freaking loud. Happens only when I close my eyes though. Or just listening to any voices triggers it too. Too funny.
176064544,i haven’t for years. i always have a night light on. or a hall light. i don’t like to hallucinate in the dark is why.
176064545,"Hi everyone! I think I’m having difficulty differentiating between my negative thoughts and voice. I hear in my head that I should slit my mother and dog’s throat( but I hear I, not you should as in a command). The negative thoughts are heard after I’m having normal thoughts. I think my meds aren’t working effectively. Anyone feel this way?"
176064546,"But she surely got excited about my sister. My pdoc told me that, emotionally, we had a different set of parents. I can understand that."
176064547,_AT_MENTION_ there is nothing to worry about. You said nothing wrong in the slightest. Absolutely zero problems with HR because of this Is this the same colleague who keeps badmouthing your boyfriend. In my opinion she is insanely jealous of you and takes any opportunity to put you down
176064548,What woman threatened to kill you? When did she threaten you? Why did she threaten you?

176064550,"If you really want to prove the correctness of your delusional opinion in what i writ Why are you not writing by yourself on these topics (hallucination) if you know it mainly ,instead of inviting the readers to read reports written by the minds of others ?"
174358355,"I take Clozapine and Ziprasidone, and this combination is just enough to get me to sleep. Sometimes i can have difficulty waking up, but as a general rule, once i’m awake, i’m awake. Everybody responds differently to different medication. I would discuss your side effects with your psychiatrist, they may be able to suggest something for you."
176064551,I needed some acedia to balance out my grandeur
174358361,Im taking following meds and there is no ocd relief. OCD doubts are extreme. Therapy is not helping as well. clozapine 75mg amisulpride 150mg paroxetine 37.5mg escitalopram 20mg clobazam 10mg trihexpheydal 2mg OCD is most likely clozapine induced. But reducing clozapine further makes me cry and increasing amisulpride gives me anxiety. I have appointment with my pdoc soon but i dont know what to do anymore

176064556,"Lol,you will be put on an antipsychotic if you do that. Most probably put on an injection even for non compliance"
176064557,"I slept a lot on 15mg abilify, probably because getting up was difficult. I realised i couldn’t continue drinking coffee because it was making the waking up more difficult. During the day it was ok and 10mg was not as bad."
176064558,"10 years. I thought I would beat this illness, apparently not. ????!"
176064559,Listen to your Granny and _AT_MENTION_ The meds you are taking now are not working. Listen to your doctors!

176064561,"Work is a good thing, if you can handle it. You might find having a job to be good for your mental health. Besides the money, it gives you something to do with some of your time and gives some structure to your days. It may give you a sense of pride and satisfaction as well. So yeah, I think this could be a very good thing for your recovery."

176064567,The last time I got really angry I threatened a hospital pdoc. Now I’m in legal trouble because of that. There’s definitely a fine line between just experiencing the emotion and acting on it.

174358369,"hey man im 30 year old male with schizoaffective too. i was in a 6 month relationship about a year ago. and my girlfriend was disabled too with similar and some extra conditions. but i think with being in a relationship for me anyway, its hard enough just finding someone. then when you do its kinda a dice roll as to what luck you get as to how your partner will vibe with you. meaning that your partner can either bring out of the best in you or be negative and cause more symptoms. so i think that its just a matter of trying to find the right one. however like i said for me anyway i live in a small town in america and it seems that there is rarely any opportunities for me to mingle and try to hook up with a woman. i also feel like you do that if i dont find someone that i will live a more depressed life from having to see all my friends and everyone else i know be able to work a full time job and then have a wife and just having kids and a family. but there are some benefits to being single such as b
eing able to do things you want to or get into something such as a activity or hobby or something. i lived with my ex for 2 months and her symptoms started getting bad near the end of that before we broke up. but i have heard a lot of stories about people like us finding someone and it working out good. i see it as just kinda a luck thing. because a lot of people i know that are healthy i understand them when they dont introduce me to someone with similar interests because of my condition they think i will mess it up or something but when it comes to other people who are disabled or mentally ill there is a greater chance of meeting. its part of our identity so naturally we are going to be pared up with likeminded people. and im sure there are some couples who have one person who has a mental illness or disability. but yea i use to stress out a lot about living the rest of my life alone and not having anyone that cares about me. because i know how it feels to only have family care about you or maybe your healt
h care team. just try to improve yourself. and for me personally starting to workout and exercise helped me alot with my daily routine and symptoms. it gives me something to wake up to everyday and boosts my self confidence. you should find something that makes you want to wake up everyday. work on yourself so when someone meets you you would want to date yourself. so you will have that self confidence that someone else would want to date you"
176064579,"I didn’t know that it’s about freedom to choose, i had no clue, everything i did was randomly selected for being more diverse as for doing things that i liked accepted as being good choices that i did in the past. I think I was wrong now that i learned that the way to being more spiritual it’s the most important thing in this life and the following lifes that will come in future. I have choose to learn more about spiritual ways of the religion i am part of Christian Orthodox and my wish is to become a monk if they will accept a mentally ill person idk yet. The idea of becoming more strong in belief calmes me down and i feel more peaceful knowing it is a step closer to do the right thing by sacrificing my humble spirit to guide other’s lives. Choosing to be a small part of the spiritual things gives me hope and relief thinking i might have take a good decision for my fiuture. I am not going to talk more about this bc of site rules. So bye 4 now"

176064593,I’m on amisulpride 200mg and through trial and error I’ve come to see that this is my minimum dose. 400mg was the prescribed dose and I’m very well on it but it’s expensive so I cope on 200mg. Recently I tried again to cope on 100mg and four days later became psychotic (evil spirit in my mind tried to control me and tell me to kill my husband) so had to take 300mg for two days then back to 200mg and problems subsided Of course everyone is different. Another member on here is on 800mg and found when he was on 600mg it was too little so pushed it back up I stay on 200mg which i take in morning and on bad day (usually when hearing voices or getting agitated or hypomanic) I take extra 100mg at night I’m on 5mg olanzapine as well which if that wasn’t there I’d need to take at least 400mg amisulpride but the little olanzapine I take means I can cope on less amisulpride

176064597,"Hi all, I’ve been raving around here how good Lyrica is for my symptoms, some of you might remember me. I would like now to retract all that lol. Initially it did gave me a relief from anxiety and “emotional stiffness”, but after about two years of (ab)use I can safely say it caused me much more problems than it solved. Disinhibiting properties of this drug can get really ugly if you are not careful. I’ve been talking and doing things I would never in my right mind. From today’s sober perspective it’s like I’ve been drunk all this time. But you have no sickness morning after or hangover of any kind to warn you something is wrong. You think you are the best version of yourself! In reality, you are just constantly high. Not sure what else to say… I’ve quitted it cold-turkey 9 days ago and for first couple of days small doses of bromazepam have helped me go through physical withdrawal. Now I’m on my own, dealing with rebound anxiety, lamenting over those two years. But it feels goo

174358376,the best way to reduce negative symptoms is to discover ways to reduce stress and then lower the dose of the med if the pdoc agrees. (man I smell nice food downstairs) have you ever tried lowering the dose of your med with the help of a pdoc I don’t recommend people to do that unless they feel comfortable to!!!

You can attack any institution and make an argument against it. You are obviously intelligent but you might as well speak out against marriage, politics, family, volunteer jobs or the presidency. The world revolves around working. Not slavery. Getting paid for work is accepted. slavery is not. And there’s reasons for both… Maybe history shows that through all time since Jesus was alive that work should have been abolished or whatever you would say should be done about it. But that’s the past. How do you say the repairs of the infrastructure of America should be accomplished? We need people to work to keep civilization going. The simplest argument for work is what’s the alternative? Should the world abolish getting paid for work? Who’s going to volunteer to build bridges, housing, parks, hospitals etc?. The world accepts that most people are unhappy w
ith their jobs. But people are unhappy about a lot if things. A list: Their families, their neighbors, the president, other countries, their cars, the cost of living, bad drivers. But you have to accept and put up with a lot of crap as an adult that you have no power and control over. And there’s plenty of people who like their jobs besides actors and artists. I could go on.

Even if I wake up in a hospital bed when I die Why am I here??? Hell I don’t fn have many answers. Just what seems to make sense to me Take this all with a grain of sand.

176064648,"One theory is that the inflamed brain thinks too fast, which leads to mania and delusions, as the critical faculties are unable to process sensory input at a reasonable speed, since the faculties are working too hard (they are engorged with fluids from being inflamed, which forces them to work harder.)

176064654,"Dizzy, I look at it like this; the others are not our keepers but more so our fellow inmates. You have no conspiracy to fear coming from those around us; only need to understand that they are crazy too in their own ways but in ways which also make them selfish. I think we question those red flags that come to us about others because we are aware that we are easily paranoid but I’ve found it safe to rely on those red flags hiding some genuine concern that we exaggerate. ie; “I met someone new, I fear they might want to harm me” is an over-exaggeration to the more realistic “I met someone new but I get the impression they are using me for some reason and will leave me once I am of no use to them anymore.” The flags of doubt do have some merit. Also, as far as conspiracy goes, I don’t believe this world is of malicious intent; all rabbit holes I have been down suggest that our current life is the bi-product of science trying to make things better despite that science not yet being sophisti
cated enough to do so properly or ethically."
176064655,"When I became a Data Analyst I was most proud. I started off working 2 days a week as a temp packing envelopes. Gradually I learnt Excel, and became an advanced user. In 6 years I got promoted 4 times and won an industry data award I left in March due to the stress and anxiety I was experiencing, and I just was not enjoying it any more. Got to be a Senior Insight Analyst, but really they should have made me an Insight Manager due to the fact I was doing everything on the job spec. Anyways, Data Analyst was the time I felt most proud of myself, as I always looked up to people doing those jobs, and when I made it myself, it was amazing to work in that job. My main problem I think was that I over extended myself getting promoted too many times. The job stress that came with the Senior role was far too high for someone with my issues to manage. The commute was a killer as well."

I can’t do it. We travel forward in time all the time. Just typing this in 30 seconds, I traveled about 30 seconds forward in time, for example. I’m really interested in time. I suffered some severe cognitive issues from schizophrenia like not perceiving time at all for years and same thing with space so I have had time to think about these issues. I think time travel to the past is definitely possible, but not with today’s technology. You would need an electrically charged, spinning black hole that would probably allow time travel to a
nother universe backwards in time. This is one form of time travel that I have memories or delusions about, but I think it’s real. I expect breakthroughs in technology in the next 5-10 years. Stuff people think will take a century will be solved in a quarter of time."

I don’t like doing that, but with some people it’s the only way it seems. Some people have very little interest in what other people have to say I guess. Or they view talking as a way of empowerment. Like the more they talk the more they feel they matter and are aknowledged or something like that That’s not to say that people that speak a lot are bad, not at all. I don’t talk very much so I appreciate others that can take lead and keep the conversation going. It’s just in those cases when the conversation becomes a battle, like politicians trying to voice over each other when it gets unpleasant. I guess politicians are a perfect example.

176064780,Yes it’s so true that meds use up a lot of ur time doing nothing. For me. I look to the positive and aim to do one thing per day til I get a job. Today I’m going on a day trip with my brother so that will be my thing for the day.

176064790,"When I was first given some samples of Geodon, I felt like other parts of my brain started working for the first time ever… i thought i had some sort of gift. I was delusional but didn’t know it. I saw some stuff even as I was driving myself to my doctor’s appointment. My husband at the time, called me and I told him everything while driving. He told me to pull over and I did. Suddenly, an ambulance picked me up. I wounded up in the hospital. I saw a spiritual warfare going on while in the hospital. My doctor put me on Risperdal. It took a while to kick in. People were able to read my mind. I saw a dark shadow enter into one of the patients and that patient threatened to kill me and called me names. He didn’t know what was going on. The Risperdal worked and so I was able to go back to work. But my mind was like blah. I began to suck at my job. That’s only my first episode- took place in 2005."

176064801,I had some spiritual and semi religious delusions pre treatment. But now I feel like my spirituality/beliefs help me with my sz
176064802,Yeah. You get some coverage with sz symptoms. For example. Depression is common. So is anxiety and they all can feed each other. I’ve found most people exist on combinations of meds. Just the way it is but it’s always about treat the symptoms. The only problem is we are all different and psychiatrists and providers have different skill sets…

176064804,"Sorry I wasn’t able to report back to everyone else. But I appreciate everyone’s support! Well, I’ve tried visiting a Psychologist way back about my condition. She told me to report back (if it weren’t for financial issues) and decide whether I talk to a Psychiatrist (it’s up to me, not that she’s forcing me to which I’m actually thankful for). I’ve been living well despite not taking any medication - I’m not saying I shouldn’t, it’s just that my case is somehow different from SZ. I just searched in the internet and thought that I have SZ because of my thought broadcasting. What is happening to me is outside my mind and many times, I’ve tried to prove it to myself by recording everything around me. It usually stops when I do that. Since no one believed me, I was desperate for answers. So I had to record my surroundings whenever I’m alone. I’m trying to fight this battle alone. I’m just existing atm but not entirely living.

176064808,"If it makes you feel any better, I only complain about myself (“I suck” or “Oh, it hurts!”). I think everyone gets tired of that, too. Happy Thanksgiving anyways!!!"
176064809,"I’m so sorry, _AT_MENTION_ . That must have been awful for you! When I was 17, I had a baby die in my womb at around 6 months’ term. The doctor actually asked me if I wanted to wait around and give birth when I eventually went into labor or just have them induce. Of course, I said induce. Then, the doctor refused to give me pain medicine despite my requests. When I felt the need to push, I panicked and said, “You haven’t given me pain medicine yet!”, and she said that she’d only told me she would to appease me and never actually intended to. Then, afterwards, a social worker came by and threatened to have my now-husband arrested because of our age difference. I told her good luck because I’d turn 18 one month later, so she’d have to be extra speedy on her casework. My hubby was in FL at the time on a work assignment, so I went through all of this alone. It was horrible, painful, and so, so lonely. I get that feeling."
176064810,Lol! I used to be very strictly religious and didn’t drink until a few years ago. It was just beer and wine. I’ve never learned the other drinks so my mind doesn’t go there. But it is definitely funny!

176064814,weren’t you debating between doing something else tutoring and helping your peers or something? It’s hard to give advice on this. your symptoms could totally allieviate or get worse. what about that peer thing? I have wanted to work but with my symptoms i need a lot of flexibility. So i am self employed and work online and a couple other things as well. i work when i can. i can’t work a job with a schedule. But you seem to be doing really well and maybe this is a setback… A lot of people do work part time with a schedule. maybe that peer coaching might be a better fit?? If it allows flexibility… I’m not sure.

176064817,Well it’s good you are aware of this. Call your psychiatrist and talk to them about it. Maybe you need new medicine. I’ve been having similar problems (delusions and hallucinations). I’m starting on Invega _PERSON_ soon.

176064826,My paranoia hasn’t been a problem for years. But prior to getting on the right meds I was stuck in “fight or flight” survival mode everyday. It’s amazing to me now that I lived like that.
176064827,"Yeah…I guess I will continue to mask. I’ve been terrified of being left out ever since I was young. I was bullied when I was young because I excelled in school but was “odd” and teachers would punish me a lot and abuse me. I doubt that I will go to the doctor for diagnosis of autism because the office is simply inaccessible for me to go. I can’t risk ruining my joints…but it’s good that I know what’s going on at least, or at least I think I also have it with sz."

174358446,"Introduction Schizophrenia is currently believed to be a syndrome comprising several distinct diseases.1,2 Although the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is unclear, several studies suggest that it is associated with immunologic factors.3-6 Recent studies report that approximately 20-30% patients with schizophrenia are positive for anti-gliadin IgG (AGA-IgG) compared to less than 10% in controls,7-9 and have shown that AGA-IgG positive patients of schizophrenia could be a subgroup. Additionally, the patients with recent-onset or multi-episode schizophrenia had a higher prevalence of AGA-IgG compared with controls.10 Positive symptoms of schizophrenia were lower in the AGA-IgG positive patients.11 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X19300239?via%3Dihub"

176064861,"I saw on some programme that there are many szs who even live with voices and don’t take meds. It doesn’t mean they are not mentally ill. They have learned to live with their condition. If the illness that you say you don’t suffer from takes over your life and functioning isn’t being carried out then maybe meds might actually help. It is not clear how your negatives are affecting your life or your doctor apparent positives are affecting your life either. It makes things difficult to appraise or evaluate. You are cognizant, make sense and are intelligent. I can’t see how bizarre thoughts are affecting your life unless there are things you aren’t telling us.

For the time being I want to make sure that I attend the Shiatsu theory course I’ve signed up to every week and prepare a course to teach voluntarily at a recovery college. They asked me to teach astrology but I want to teach a course called “From Music to Mathematics”. I need to do some background reading first to make sure I can deliver it in a comprehensive form. I haven’t set a date yet for when I’ll start teaching, I’m not confident enough. I have been finding reading books difficult at the moment, though I have plenty of them. I’m a bit annoyed I don’t have enough to finance doing the practical Shiatsu course as well at the moment, but not complaining. I might try and get a free overdraft, but I’m not sure if m

It doesn’t disrupt me.) You need to offset the pro-oxidant activity of a standard diet with enough antioxidants to put your body in a net healing mode, for a long enough time, to heal the blood brain barrier and leaky gut issues. Also, can’t have high fat meals, that disrupts the tight junctions of the gut, causing inflammation."

I also work out with adjustable dumbbells: shoulder shrugs, side bends, standing shoulder press, biceps curl, triceps extension. Presently the weight of my dumbbells is 30 Lb. I would like to add another fitness machine, maybe a cross trainer, but there is no space left to do so. Instead I decided to join a nearby gym, today is my second visit there. In the gym I can train my chest muscles, lower back muscles, abdominal muscles, adduction and abduction muscles. And leg press. Also there is a good choice of cardio machines in the gym. I once presented a workshop on dumbbells. You can train your whole body with them."

176064947,Why not just see a dermatologist? He will tell you for sure what it is and how to treat+prevent it.
174358457,"I was just thinking. Maybe these different past lives are not real at all. Maybe it’s the schizophrenia making me hallucinate my reality combined with fantasy. But I do believe in one thing: that I’m reliving my life over and over again exactly the same way. Sometimes I died before now (most of the time) and sometimes I die later on in different ways, which is why I’m worried or stressed out and even paranoid most of the time from my dreams and day light hallucinations… Maybe I never was this or that and most definitely not a surgeon of all things. I know I have memories of going to school after I dropped out but it must have been a fluke… I know I finished my BA at a local school which I will not name. It could have been another reality. But a doctor? Come on. I know I tried to a few times. It’s hard to tell you the truth sometimes that the government did experiment on me with time travel and that I went crazy. They say adults who go through time tend to go insane compared to the kids 
they experiment on. So why me unless they wanted me to go crazy? Unless they didn’t know…or it was on purpose. I tend to think we live in a simulation and perhaps reality ended for us or me on December 22, 2012 or something or maybe in 2011. I just watched a video and it seems to me like I hit time zero or the block that resulted in insanity for me where I became infinite and then came back in time, perhaps, after going to the future? I know I tried or wanted to be a computer engineer but don’t know if I actually finished the program or dropped out. I sometimes come through space-time or wormholes like the Terminator lol (even though I’m definitely not lol). I sometimes feel the local physics around me changes proving the novikov self-consistency principle wrong. Most physicists are wrong and even _NAME_. Even some smart, world-renowned physicist at my former school wrote a book saying time travel isn’t real. en.wikipedia.org _PERSON_ self-consistency principle The _PERSON_ self-consistency principl
e, also known as the _PERSON_ self-consistency conjecture and _NAME_ law of conservation of history, is a principle developed by Russian physicist _PERSON_ in the mid-1980s. _PERSON_ intended it to solve the problem of paradoxes in time travel, which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of general relativity that contain what are known as closed timelike curves. The principle asserts that if an event exists that would cause a p... I was a time traveler, worker, slave, and boy in the Montauk Project. I’m disabled. Deal with it. Take it or leave it. I hope I can stay here. If not, I’ll go back to youtube for now. I really don’t know whose sending me back in time. It might be an infinite causal loop. I don’t know if it’s an open loop or a closed loop. This has been going on for a long time. I sometimes feel I lack free will. I cannot before I got my schizophrenia, meaning I think I was experimented on in college. I don’t think pot unless I smoked some PKD reality warping drug did this to m
e. Maybe the Navy threw me or sent me through a damn wormhole. I have memories of this but it goes back billions of lifetimes ago. I never figured it out, damn. I never figured out who was the guy or what organization was responsible. Then I got the whole vampire delusion thing which I know isn’t real. I think my safety is MUCH safer than money. I’m just glad I can talk mostly. I think I died millions or billions of times. Nobody gives a ???? at all. I was tortured. My family died sometimes. It hurt me a lot… I guess I accidentally or did change history a few times and I suffered the consequences, whether it was my fault or not I don’t know. I didn’t mean to. It just happened accidentally. Alien mind control? I’m just tired of disappearing and going back in time while you guys live your beautiful lives forward in time. I often think reality is like a TV film. When it’s over, you start it again, over and over again. Nothing changes anymore. I think I could have been a crappy, shitty super soldier
, but it’s infinitely better than being a Montauk boy. They tell me different things throughout my other lives. They say the butterfly effect isn’t real, but I don’t know. Probably not, but I have changed history before and I paid the consequences. I don’t know how they do it. They told me they send minds back in time, not people with time machines. I’m guessing wormholes and consciousness after the person dies? The consciousness goes into the person, I guess…after the wormhole collapses…I don’t know. My mind is pretty damaged. I have irrational and ‘stupid’ thoughts that are contradictory and delusional – other than this stuff. I guess it’s just hard to realize I went insane over a billion times and ended up in an incinerator. Felt like the mental hospital was involved or something. Can’t blame the aliens for everything. I guess that’s why I’m talking. It all started at the school I went to in 2010-2011. It all started there. It ended up falling me to the mental hospital. I hate 
it there due to flashbacks and recall and _NAME_. I don’t go there anymore. It was always strange or fishy sometimes about ‘who’ was doing this to me or who was after me. Luckily, I am safe right now and it has stopped. Honestly, I would love the Montauk Project to stop and be shut down but it will never. That’s what they told me in a past life. It didn’t end in the 80s like they said. I don’t know. I guess they got locations everywhere. I might have to leave these forums because it’s a schizophrenic support forum, not a conspiracy forum or anything. Thank you."
176064948,"So I have always believed in taking on the negative karma of others, their problems, but there is a distinction between negative karma and someone’s problems. Taking on negative karma of someone is putting yourself between the person and their karma. Taking on somebody else’s problems is impossible. This is because nothing repeats exactly, everything is in flux. Problems are not things, they are events, and events do not repeat exactly. Everyone experiences events from their own perspective. Writing logoically involves putting oneself between someone and their negative karma as a shield and wishing them the best. Envy and covetousness is where I have been going wrong, trying to experience what somebody else experiences, which is impossible. Thank you."

176064956,"Yes it worries me a lot right now the sheer outlandishness of my delusions. One of them being that some Chinese people have a yin yang curse that prevents them from going to heaven, there’s a lot of bullying going on in mental health that needs to be addressed, and that my grandpa from Shandong is my original birth father from a past life. But it makes sense, my grandma is pure Hakka from a very sacred village. Not sure white people understand just how important that is. And my grandpa is from Shandong and my dad’s family is from Anhui. Therefore many of my acquaintances, people I choose to date, friends, etc. are Japanese. Don’t want to speed things up but my delusion is that there are people like one of the friends in the photo I posted who will be in big trouble transitioning through the group home system and helping the wrong side is bad for us all."
174358472,Ever since starting Invega I have had poverty of speech and thought. I just don’t talk that much and it kills me. I would really like to be social and talk a lot but not too much. Is there another med or supplement that helps with poverty of speech and thought? I also just don’t have a lot of thoughts. The meds I’m on are extremely mind numbing and makes me feel like there are no thoughts in my head. Good that I don’t have racing thoughts but it would be nice to be able to think faster about what I’m going to say and have the urge to actually speak my thoughts aloud. Anyone else have this and what can be done to help? My pdoc doesn’t believe it’s caused by the meds and thinks it’s just negative symptoms.

If your therapist suggests employment, you should understand it’s for the benefit for you and your well being.

176065010,"Some people may think that I overthink. Coincidences are rather not associated with single numbers, but rather with their combinations - usually two or three. Many of them are associated with arithmetic and geometric sequences, some (relatively “new”) are associated with prime numbers. First coincidences from 2014 were not so associated with numbers, at least numbers were not as important as in many latter ones. I noticed that from date 19.9.2014 (when events very important for my first coincs happened) two numbers “19” can be formed probably only in 2019, above four years after initial coincs. Number 14 was also somewhat coincident in IX 2014. I am interested if someone else noticed something exceptional in geometric sequence 21, 42, 84 (and its descending counterpart: 84, 42, 21 ) or in quartet of arithmetic sequences formed by the same digits: 11, 24, 37; 11, 42, 73; 13, 42, 71; 17, 24, 37. 21 7 and 12 4 are pretty unique pairs of numbers: their arithmetic means are the same as their dif
ferences and their products of digits (which is, in my opinion, pretty large coincidence) - (21+7):2 = 14 = 21-7 = 2x1x7; (12+4):2 = 8 = 12-4 = 1x2x4, (2+1)x7 = 21 and (1+2)x4 = 12, such an operation gives first number of the double (large one), (2-1)x7 = 7, (1-2)x4 = -4, |-4| = 4, absolute values of numbers formed by the same operation are smaller numbers of the doubles, 21 7 and 12 4 have larger numbers formed by the same digits and have the same quotients of larger and smaller numbers in the doubles (21:7 = 12:4 = 3), 3 is the number of digits in these doubles."

The girl I am training with is a veteran and her husband is a 100% disabled veteran and our instructor is a military wife and wants her husband to file for disability when he retires so they were talking about 100% disabled vets all day in the car. I let it slip that I was also a 100% disabled veteran. I got the job with a 10 point preference for being a 30% or more disabled veteran but they certainly didn’t know I was 100. I probably should have kept my mouth shut. And they asked me what I did in the Marines and I said pilot and told them if I hadn’t been medically retired I would still be flying for a living. Eventually they were going to ask about what I did in the Marines so I guess I am glad I got that out the way but I probably shouldn’t have let the 100% disabled slip.

176065042,"The voices I hear do not exist internally in my head. They exsist outside of my head (externally) and can be heard in certain locations in my home–outside my windows and sometimes above near the ceiling. What’s strange is that when I open the windows to my home, the voices can be heard more clearly. When the windows are down, their voices become more muffled. When I put on ear phones, the voices can not be heard as much. I detect the voices of about three women, and about four males; unfamiliar voices that I have never heard in my lifetime. The voices seem to exist as a group of people. They do talk amongst one another and their voices fade in and out as if they are moving closer and nearer to the windows of my home. Currently, I hear the voice of an African-American sounding woman in her mid-to-late 30’s saying “She doesn’t even know why we are here.” Lastly, I at times, hear the “clicking” of a machine being pressed, similar to the sound of buttons being pressed on a tape recorder

There seems to be 1 thing that is controlling and orchestrating the behavior/appearance of all these: the voice, fake thoughts, my body, dreams, and mental images."

174358503,"Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics represent a valuable strategy to improve treatment adherence and reduce the risk for relapse in patients with schizophrenia. In a 12-month trial of 86 patients with first-episode schizophrenia, the relapse rate was 33% among those taking oral antipsychotics vs 5% among those receiving LAIs.6 Another study of recently diagnosed patients with schizophrenia found that the risk for relapse was nearly 30% lower with LAIs compared with oral medication. LAIs have also been linked to decreased rates of hospitalization compared with oral antipsychotics: 20% to 30% lower in a 2017 trial of more than 30,000 patients. However, LAIs remain underprescribed by physicians."

176065118,"All my life I feel I was pretty weird though I thought everyone was like that. I had tactile and olfactory hallucinations growing up. I think I also had some delusions too. I traveled a lot as a child but did most of my traveling as a young adult. I got into Pre med somewhere in Europe at the age of 16. I got some awards and felt really good. I was the top of my class and I barely ever studied. My first year in med school I got a 4. something gpa and qualified for a scholarship on merit. I was really doing well till I was not. I got really bad prodromal symptoms and was struggling a lot. I had severe panic attacks, I could barely breathe in public, I had anxiety and really bad obsessions. I could barely read, pay attention in class or understand anything. I failed my pharmacology course and so I had to take a summer course in Vermont. That’s when I really wanted to kill myself, I never could read anything but I managed to pass the course. I got back and my uni wanted me to take an oral exam again 
the next semester which I failed. I could barely remember the hard questions I was being asked. I felt like there was nothing but a fog in my mind. I think they failed me because they were jealous of me or hated me or were racists. I think strongly that they were racists. I got expelled for failing the exam even though I had a 3. something gpa. I ended up transferring my credits to the Caribbean and graduated last year with my MD. Now I have to get a license to practice in the US or somewhere else maybe but idk, I may do something else with my life. I regret not having sex with all the men I was attracted to (especially the ones I was obsessed with). I think I was too conservative and now I feel sexually unsatisfied and often have strange sexual hallucinations, delusions and intrusive thoughts. I have been really holding on to God more now than ever, it helps to think there’s something greater than me out there. It got me through some of the toughest symptoms I had no matter how perverted and sickening."

176065161,"I had lunch with my step-dad two weeks ago. I told him of my situation with the (now diseased) neighbor. I told him how I heard violent thumps upstairs. I told him the guy drinks alone in his room. I told him the guy was a 300 lb bully who constantly left his apartment upstairs and sat on the stairs outside my door making unmistakable disrespectful spitting noises and vaguely threatening. I would say my step-dad is a realist. He taught for 11 or 12 years at the local university business college as a professor. That means for 11 years he was up in front of classes with teenagers and people in their twenty’s with classes as big as 40 people. He worked for years in Sauidi Arabia when he was younger. So I told him that stuff and asked his opinion. He calmly but resolutely said if he was me than he would get a gun. I was taken aback but didn’t show it. We’ve known each other for almost thirty years, he knows I don’t act or talk crazy. I would never get a gun in a million years but I’m glad tha
t he trusted that I could own a gun responsibly and I felt validated about my situation because the counselor here refuses or is oblivious (by choice) about what goes on here and doesn’t want to believe anything bad goes on here or bad about the people despite the evidence. In fact yesterday I had an epiphany. I realized I haven’t been treated this badly since high school. I’ve lived in many different situations in the last 40 years. When was twenty I was put in my first group home in the downtown area of San _NAME_ Ca. I was pretty naïve and I was introduced to certain facets of the big city. Some of the characters in the house could get dangerous. Later, in the same city I was locked up with about 80 other mentally ill people and some of those people could get dangerous…and so on. In fact, in my thirties I lived on one of the most notorious streets known for drugs in a group home. But I’m in a supposedly nice neighborhood but I am treated worse here than any place I’ve ever been before. And it
s constant. I tell this story a lot and I rationalize that, yeah it’s bad but it only happens a few times a day. But that’s not it at all, now, it is all day, from when I wake up until I go to bed. These people are not only full of sh*t but they’re seriously ill and respect nothing. I never knew growing up that people would actually bug and threaten you in your own home without provocation, with no respect for privacy or common human decency. I guess I’m happiest that I got validation about what’s going on here."

176065183,I used to be much more intelligent and capable of understanding/ memorizing. Now there are days when I don’t know up from down.
176065184,"_AT_MENTION_, I suggested you buy a $3.00 plunger to unblock your toilet by yourself, and you’ve been ranting and raving for the last week about how unfair we all are to you and how none of us understand. You get super defensive whenever somebody suggests you try something different to better yourself and your situation. Nobody on this forum is out to get you. On the contrary, we’re all trying to help you live a more satisfying and rewarding life."

176065204,Yes a lot of the psych meds affect different parts of our organs. Depakote did a number on my liver after decades of heavy use. Antipsychotic medications are no different. They wreak havoc on our bodies. This is why you should take extra care with our diets and exercise.
176065205,Possibly sz could be as much what you ARE seeing as much as what you arent seeing. Its hard for me to trust othors as well and they often demand that you do for no reason. Sometimes its harder to believe what you are seeing.

174358536,"Yes. I had a Swedish consultant who was very much into PDs. That, and mutual animosity between the mental health team and I , were the breeding grounds for the sz-a dx to be ditched. In Sept 2017 I moved, and saw my new pdoc in Oct 2018. He was better mannered,more amiable and more intelligent . He was very thorough re asking questions. The subject of autism was raised by me.My stepdaughter ,who has worked with people on the spectrum, backed me up. Instead of dismissing the subject, as would have happened with my previous MH trust, he asked questions . He also did a test with my hands and said I was quite dyspraxic. His initial opinion was that the best fit was schizophrenia and ASD. . Very soon after that I received a letter for an ASD assessment. The _PERSON_’s dx was given in May 2019. In Oct 2019 the pdoc brought back to review the dx. Based on further exploration, that showed I had had past phases of low and high mood with concurrently occurring psychotic symptoms, the sz was changed to sz-a

176065227,"Does your college have any services for the disabled? Some colleges have an office or program that helps disabled people succeed in college. Some colleges even pay for some registration fees for the disabled and give them priority to register for classes before other students to make sure they get first shot at the classes they need. The community colleges I went to had a disabled students program, They had special services like giving a disabled student more time for taking tests. They have counselors who help you with your goals in college and figure out what classes you need. They offer tutoring services. Before COVID hit they had computers at school you could use at your convenience. IDK, you may want to look into that. They are discreet and keep their students anonymity. I don’t know the extent of all the services they offer but you might want to call your college and inquire about a disabled student services."

174358542,"Yes, they have this fixed idea about ‘early intervention’ but the problem is cognititve deterioration and excessive prunning and drugs are not targeting it (except Latuda, but I’ve been pointed that this is also still a controversy). So the whole thing of early intervention is a myth, but of course if you intervene early the person might be able to not alienate friends, to keep his/her job, etc. So nothing magical in early intervention."

Because I know that thoughts/beliefs play a role on our perceptions and how we experience reality. Just because I was told I was crazy doesn’t necessarily mean I was, and it’s not like I have ever had an episode as severe. If crazy is subjective than maybe I shouldn’t fall into a trap where I let someone define that for me. And there are so many pills, pill for this pill for that."

And I decided taking myself out to the library and buying myself a nice coffee was the most destressful thing I could do. So now I’m out drinking my coffee. And I feel happy and don’t feel like binging anymore. So it’s early days but mayb the key for me is to take the actions that wud destress me the most

176065243,I am aware of that. But what meaning do you like to give to notions as ‘real’ and ‘fact’ that does not trace back to intersubjective reality and its ways of establishing facts and distinctions between what’s real and unreal?

176065246,"Reading about ‘positive feedback loops’ gave me a theory (something that feels more than just my usual metaphor.) In music it’s the feedback sound when music gets amplified and goes back into the mic and ultimately causes that screeching sound. Cutting to the chase I sort of think psychosis is that screeching sound. One thing I recall about this topic is that they don’t end well. Positive feedback loops that is. But I should offer all this stems from my first gander of the topic of Sz on Wikipedia about 10 years ago. Wiki is always changing. But it’s opening line was that it’s a disorder effecting perception and expression. On the old site I said this and the admin at the time paid it some respect. I remember he asked me if I was on medication, nonetheless I think he liked it. Maybe break the pattern by getting off Facebook, I did 12 months ago. It’s really poison."

176065248,"_AT_MENTION_ , I don’t know the situation with your little brother. When you give someone enough rope, you’re actually allowing that person to continue with what he is doing. E.g. a compulsive gambler, will loose his house, wife,family,job,etc untill he end up rock bottom, hopefully not in the streets… And it is only then when he will reflect on his life and return to a more acceptable lifstyle. The same goes for substance abuse. If the person is lucky enough to end up in AA etc he’ll have the opportunity to recover. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind when giving enough rope. E.g Allow the police arrests etc cause it all force people to want to do better."

n (if it is existed ) or not ! -using the word “schizophrenia” ,it means you are talking about the symptoms (except the hallucinations) 3-You can using the term “disease” only in the case if you find out the pathogen and the mechanisms of effect which creating the symptoms and prove that by scientific experiment,so that all of us believe that sz is real actual disease ! 4- Do not say what sz is before you have the final results of your scientific working ,wherever the content of results will tell us what is sz face to face !"

I had minor success with grounding exercises that I came up with. Namely after six years of desperately trying I got two weeks of clarity. It just isn’t practical. Exorcisms did diddly dick for me either. Just get to a hospital, it will never get better on its own. +++ Meds that visitors of this forum discuss may be unavailable to you at your locale. Certainly the case for me. So don’t repeat my mistake and try to prescribe meds to yourself."

No good references from any of them but I was mostly employed. I got stable in 2015 and went back to school and got my aircraft mechanics licenses and tried working in that field in 2017 but was late a lot and I didn’t really like what I was doing. I worked a few months in 2018 but still had a lot of issues. I went back to work March 17th of this year and I am doing okay so far. Full time and haven’t been late once. So it wasn’t for a lack of trying but the short answer is it took about 11 years. If I still have a job next April I was successful as I am on probation. So the jury is still out on whether or not I have made it. Good luck. It doesn’t hurt to try. If you don’t try you won’t know.
174358553,Hey guys. I wasn’t even diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was misdiagnosed as borderline and I was on an antipsychotic (Zyprexa) and I stopped it abruptly by myself which made me go into psychosis so they put me on those medications temporarily and now I will stop them.

I am not going to be further marginalized by a label that basically says everything you see or hear is a hallucination. This disempowers victims of abuse.”"

Also I have bizzarre thoughts like talking to a tree as if it was a specific friend and if I don’t, my friend will be mad at me. Did any of you experience this? Is it derealization and depersonalization? It doesn’t affect me much but wastes my time and I don’t want ppl see me talking to an object."

176065307,I think the first place I will apply at is the pizza place in town. they are hiring now. hopefully I can find somewhere that will allow me only 20 hours. my caseworker recommended working at a fast food place. I’ve worked at pizza places before delivering pizzas but this time I want to work in the kitchen. I don’t want to put a lot of miles on my car and add more wear and tear to it. and also it’s only about 3 miles away so it wouldn’t be much of a commute. most of the adults in this community commute 15-50 miles one way into the cities for work. so I would be happy to not have to do that.

176065311,I am no longer symptomatic after a long hospitalization but I used to think there were invisible people using a “shaddow app” on their phone to harass people. They could do things to me like write on my clothes or skin which would show up to them but not me and I couldn’t prevent them because they were invisible. They could also video record you while you couldn’t know that like in the shower or bathroom. I no longer think this and it sounds rediculous but it’s what I thought for a long time. More than a year. I would see outlines of them walking around and it drove me crazy where I was showering in the dark for a while.

176065354,yea i don’t get what the big deal is about this either. I think here you are required to say that you have mental illness too. Especially when you drive trucks they make you come for medical testing every couple years if you want to renew your license.

I have a Siberian Husky/German Shepherd, and while I have and will do anything for him, he does become costly…and he’s very low maintenance. Some stuff to think about."

176065391,"_NAME_’s psychiatrist told his family to give him $100 and turn him loose to sink or swim on the street. We know how that turned out. (In case you don’t know “_NAME_” shot President _NAME_.) That might have worked for me if I had never been put on a major tranquilizer. But now I am so dependent on anti-psychotics that I will never be able to get off them. The problem with that is that it makes it impossible for me to deal with the weather outside. AP’s make you too prone to hyperthermia in the summer and hypothermia in the winter. I have thought that maybe I could do volunteer work tutoring people how to read, and also maybe tutor them on the GED. I think that kind of work would be more productive than a minimum wage job. I’m hopeless at fast food. I can do assembly line work, but then there is the problem of the heat. Also, I have lower back problems.

There are days where I can do many steps, but I these are rare. When I’m not in bed and it isn’t video meeting is walking because I have too much energy to sleep, so I need to use much before.

176065438,I’ve gotten quite skilled at faking being social. It wears me out something fierce.
176065439,"It means your brain is desperate to avoid feeling intense negative emotions and is looking for ways out. I combat it by trying to acknowledge the emotions I’m feeling, and tha they will go away.

I eventually learned that emotions alone can’t hurt me, regardless of how intense they were, and that distraction worked better than cutting."

174358597,Congratulations _AT_MENTION_ . I hope you have a long and prosperous life. I hope Social Security still offers early retirement at 62 when I get older but they probably won’t. I imagine I will probably have to work until I am at least into mid sixties unless I go back on SSDI before then. I look forward to being able to retire again and hope to have at least a few years left.

176065449,Omgosh that is adorable!!!
174358598,I’ve changed. I’m more quiet and much less funny. I used to be quick with a joke but that has gone away since APs. I am also isolating myself more than I used to. This is probably the schizophrenia though but me being less funny and more quiet I believe is medication related.
176065450,Wait. I thought you had a girlfriend. I guess y’all broke up. It’s been years since I’ve been on a dating site. I don’t know how they work.

176065457,"I don’t think it’s going to change the fact that every day when my battery life is 66% I heighten the screen brightness and put the setting so it doesn’t turn off till at least 5 mins so it goes down to 65%. I’ve been doing it so long I notice bad things happen during that time. Is apophenia also believing in bad things will happen if I don’t say a prayer a certain way (there can’t be any mistakes and if I fall back asleep before the beginning of the day, I have to say it again)? When I just looked it up, the net says it’s a symptom of paranoid sz. I’m diagnosed with that."
176065458,_AT_MENTION_ why do you think social security doesn’t care that you keep going over the income earning limit?

176065464,I went on antibiotics again for what I thought was my third UTI in a year. But this time antibiotics didn’t help…and the doctor told me thede may not have been UTI’s at all and I may have interstitial cystitis…and need to get all these invasive awful tests done…but couldn’t it just be a UTI with antibiotic resistant bacteria since it’s been treated so much? Why would antibiotics have helped in the past if it wasn’t ever actually a UTI? Also the key feature of IC is pain and I have no pain just horrible strong constant urges to pee. I don’t know I’m very stressed about this whole thing and I haven’t been able to sleep properly in weeks because my bladder just spasms constantly it is so awful.

176065475,I have my passions but there are days where I have to force myself to do it. I think it is a combination of sz and perhaps the medication making us drowsy.

176065487,"I am from Europe (Croatia) and would like to try Latuda. Latuda is still not available in Croatia. Does anybody in Europe use Latuda? If so, from what country are you from? I ask because one pharmacist informed me that Latuda is still not available in Europe. Best regards."

Once intentional car accident at 200kmh in a snowstorm and once I swallowed a whole Tylenol bottle. My parents saw me vomitting and brought me to the emergency. They said my liver was failing and gave me an antidote to remove the tylenol from the blood."
176065501,"I have been on olanzapine for about 13 years and I definitly feel that my brain gradually has become weaker. I remember about 6 years ago I suddenly couldn’t sleep anymore if I skipped the dose for one night(which i did occasionally if I had drank alcohol). So there’s no doubt it messes up the brain. I’m thinking about switching meds. At least then I wouldn’t inhibit exactly the same brain receptors, and I might recover some."
176065502,"No headaches, no migraines. Never. Just today I woke up with vertigo, and I have it ever since"
176065503,"I became type 2 on Zyprexa. In march 2019 stopped the zyprexa cold turkey, and then ended up in ER because the insulin shut down my kidneys. They had me on 140 units of Lantis a day. I stopped the insulin all APs and went from 242lbs down to 130lbs in less than a year no change in diet or exercise. I cannot go on any drugs that cause weight gain at all. So since I’ve run the gambit we just keep upping my Xanax and I stay at home doing nothing. I live a useless life. But maybe in May I can be seen by pain.management and life may be worth living again."
176065504,"Yes, Zyprexa (40mg) gave me diabetes, high cholesterol, weight gain and high triglycerides. When I lowered my Zyprexa down to 2.5mg I lost weight and my cholesterol/triglycerides went back to normal. I still have diabetes but my blood sugar levels are pretty much normal now."

176065517,I think the attraction of going off meds has to do a lot with how easy it is to see negative things. Cause meds have a lot of unfortunate side effects and people focus on those things. Even if meds have helped them in so many other areas. There’s also the sense of curiosity of “what would happen if?” Which isnt really a good reason but people do it. But there’s lots of reasons why people try it. But it should really only be attempted with doctor approval and supervision.

176065532,Even when you know you are in the wrong do you ever go ahead and do it anyway? Do you ever just make that wrong choice and suffer the potential consequences or hope you get away with it? Do you ever plan to do something wrong or plot to do something wrong in the hopes to get away with it? What kind of person does something wrong on purpose? If I had a plan to do something I knew wasn’t the right thing to do and I was systematically and methodically carrying out this plan in a calm and calculated way over a period of time what kind of person does that make me? Does that make me a sociopath to some degree?

174358613,"This sounds like delusions of persecution to me ""Persecutory delusions are a set of delusional conditions in which the affected persons believe they are being persecuted, despite a lack of evidence. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements:[1] The individual thinks that harm is occurring, or is going to occur. The individual thinks that the perceived persecutor has the intention to cause harm. According to the DSM-IV-TR, persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in paranoid schizophrenia, where the person believes “he or she is being tormented, followed, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed”, or that their food is being poisoned.[""(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutory_delusion#cite_note-2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutory_delusion"

In google playstore there is an app called blindfold chess training. Install and play it.

I told myself the same thing three years ago after I left the hospital. I didn’t want to be disabled or miss out of life offers, so I took walks. I’d ask the brothers if they wanted to walk, and I think they could see it meant a lot to me to be able to go on a walk, so they conceded. I am absolutely certain when they see you are giving a consistent fight; they will definitely be less and less stigmatic? Sometimes, you have to bark and fight at the same time. Simply saying “I cannot because negative symptoms do this” might not work with some people. They actually have to see you physically drained and suffering - this is what it was like for me when I first started working after hospitalisation. I don’t know why.

Sex is for making babies, I don’t need the rush of dopamine that goes along with it to cement a relationship with someone, but maybe I am kidding myself, sex is an important part of male-female relationships, and without it, women can doubt your intentions. Love without sex is in many ways it is much harder than the crude love of pleasure. Maybe there is something wrong with me. Thank you."

176065652,"Iv been voice free for 7 months so we’re very alike.Mine also come back faintly sometimes but only when I’m stressed.

176065657,and you can become very disabled. My community nurse repeats the same thing to me and I asked if what would I precent like with a fried brain and he said I certainly wouldn’t be able to travel aboard and then changed the subject so I don’t think he knows and they both said it to scare me. Does it really fry your brain? I heard maybe with SZ as you develop negative symptoms but I have SZA and yes I do occasionally feel depressed but have a lot of happy /wellbeing feelings.

174358656,"I’ve heard it’s a possible cause. I think it’s different for everyone. First of all, I don’t believe it’s one disease. I believe there are many causes, but schizophrenia is any form of low brain health that manifests in psychosis. ??? It’s more the symptoms and the treatment than the “cause”. Because for me it was trauma, genetics and later drugs/alcohol. For others it could be just genetics /sheer bad luck. No rhyme or reason why they have it. So maybe this. But What’s most important is to treat it at our point. Prevention is important for future generations but I’m not sure we know that fully yet either as well."

176065678,Yes this is very risky. If I stop my meds I get ill within 3 days and usually need hospital. I’ve played with my meds before with bad results. If you want to come off meds you need to do it with your pdoc’s supervision. Be careful!!

Thought planes were going to abduct me so I’d run and hide whenever one flew overhead. Was worried gravity would suddenly reverse and I’d fall into the sky so always stayed near grounded things. I’d experience such powerful unexplainable feelings of fear all the time, sometimes in oddly specific places like in one bathroom of the house or a closet or the basement. I would be convinced there were angry spirits there or something."

Basically what happens is that an experience occurs that you can’t keep as part of your “personal narrative”, so you create an alter identity to contain the experience and deal with it, separate from your main sense of self.

176065769,It takes some deep reflection of yourself. You need to analyse what you love doing and feel good about yourself. You need to accept who you are truly. You have to identify your needs and why you need them. You need to understand what makes you tick and see the beauty inside yourself and realise it. Then you can show it to others and be loved.

174358668,"During the study, _PERSON_ and colleagues examined the fecal matter from a sample of schizophrenics and compared them with those from healthy controls. They found that schizophrenics had strikingly low diversity of bacterial species from the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, species that are normally found in abundance. In contrast, species from the Veillonellaceae family were increased in schizophrenic patients. This difference is so stark, in fact, that the fecal matter samples alone could be used to predict whether a person was schizophrenic or not. To extend this finding, _PERSON_ and colleagues took these fecal matter samples and transplanted them in mice — some mice received fecal matter from schizophrenics, and some from the healthy subjects. By receiving fecal matter transplants, the mice also received a dose of the donor’s microbiome. It’s difficult to accurately assess whether a mouse is behaving in a way that corresponds with schizophrenia, but, over the years, research
ers have characterized several behaviors that correspond to schizophrenia in mice. The researchers found that mice who received a fecal transplant from schizophrenics were more hyperactive and more easily startled, both of which are consistent in mice models of schizophrenia. Altogether, these findings suggest that there is, indeed, a strong link between the gut microbiome and the schizophrenic brain, perhaps even a causal one, although more research is needed to definitively say. However, the researchers do note that events that change the microbiome are associated with schizophrenia, implying a connection does indeed exist: In the context of these findings, several events shown to influence composition of the gut microbiome, especially during the microbiome’s establishment/dynamic period in infancy — e.g., cesarean versus vaginal birth, breast versus formula feeding, or early life antibiotic treatment — have all been associated, to some degree, with risk or onset of [schizophrenia Eating raspberries m

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of raspberry supplementation on the fecal microbiota using an in vivo model of obesity. Obese diabetic db/db mice were used in this study and assigned to two experimental groups (with and without raspberry supplementation). Fecal samples were collected at the end of the supplementation period (8 weeks) and used for bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). QIIME 1.8 was used to analyze the 16S data. Raspberry s
upplementation was associated with an increased abundance of Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.009), a very important group for gut health, and decreased abundances of Lactobacillus, Odoribacter, and the fiber degrader S24-7 family as well as unknown groups of Bacteroidales and Enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.05). These changes were enough to clearly differentiate bacterial communities accordingly to treatment, based on the analysis of UniFrac distance metrics. However, a predictive approach of functional profiles showed no difference between the treatment groups. Fecal metabolomic analysis provided critical information regarding the raspberry-supplemented group, whose relatively higher phytosterol concentrations may be relevant for the host health, considering the proven health benefits of these phytochemicals. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the observed differences in microbial communities (e.g., Lachnospiraceae) or metabolites relate to clinically significant differences that can prompt the use of raspbe
rry extracts to help patients with obesity. Obese diabetic db/db mice were used in this study and assigned to two experimental groups (with and without raspberry supplementation).

PubMed Central (PMC) The microbiome, immunity, and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are serious neuropsychiatric disorders of uncertain 
etiology. Recent studies indicate that immune activation may contribute to the etiopathogenesis of these disorders. Numerous studies in animal models indicate that... Out of a total of 25 differentially abundant species (bacteria and fungi), 6 microbial species were more abundant in cases than controls after adjusting for relevant covariates. Lactic acid bacteria were relatively more abundant in schizophrenia including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium with the largest effect found in Lactobacillus gasseri which appeared to be at least 400 times more abundant in schizophrenia patients than in controls. The study also found that 18 metabolic pathways that were enriched and 14 decreased in schizophrenia relative to controls. Pathways that were significantly altered in schizophrenia were related to environmental information processes such as saccharide, polio, and lipid transport systems All in all trying eating at least 3oz of rasberries a day it may be a great way to adjust your gut and heal the the microbiome

To me it did a great job showing the journey we go through finding the right medication, and if I remember correctly he ended the movie on medications. Many of us have had the very same struggle of deciding if the symptoms are worse than the side effects when we get hit hard by a particular side effect, and I loved that they included it. It was nice that it wasn’t just a matter of popping a pill and having everything go away immediately, and it showed within the constraints of a movie that it takes time via trial and error to find the right meds and treatment. I just honestly didn’t see anything anti psychiatry about it. I honestly got the opposite impression."

176065923,I don’t look long at people at all when talking to them - just a flash of a glance Sometimes I stare at my husband who’s looking somewhere else and he picks up on it and asks me why I’m staring at him it makes him feel uncomfortable But I’m not in habit of staring at people much. I’m too shy.
176065924,I’m okay with being required to take meds. I’m very eccentric and most people are okay with it. I just hate getting a new pdoc and having them switched around.
176065925,"Hello. It’s slither, if you have wondered I have been busy elsewhere. I just want to say how amazing this forum is. I mean 24/7 I have a place to turn. When I felt like turning to the dark side, this place showed me the light. I got a boost in self esteem here, which allowed me to finish my IT degree, if only barely with passing marks. I especially want to thank Leaf for her time and support. Also _PERSON_. When I saw him here years ago he was doing bad, but his personal growth has astounded me. So thank you again, and for keeping the “roaches” as I like to call them out. You know the ones who join a forum and expect it to revolve around them? Ninjastar, _PERSON_, and if I am forgetting any others you do a fantastic job."
176065926,Wah ! They’re all amazing ! I’m always taken back by the amount of talent on here.

176065933,"I baled hay as a teenager too. It depends on what kind of hay you’re hauling if it cuts you up. Prairie hay is the worst about cutting you up. Where I lived in Eastern Oklahoma we had some pretty good grasses in most of our meadows. They were almost as nutritious as alfalfa. The biggest problem I had with hay was stacking it in the barn, because it would be super hot and all this dust and hay particles would be in your nose. You breathed a lot of it in. It could clog up your nose. All the same, I would rather haul hay than work in fast food. I’m just not made for that kind of work."

176065942,When they bring a drug to market they study the dose that works. The package info for Zyprexa says that prescribing high doses above 30 mg is not shown to work any better. Doctors should respect the science about the drugs.
176065943,"When I was in the hospital, the voices tried to get me to do a test, but I ignored the test. I don’t play games with them. I was in despair due to those voices. I don’t hear from them as much now. Try not to entertain them. If the meds aren’t working, tell your doctor. You may need to switch or go up on the dose you’re on."
176065944,Hah hah…I feel like maybe I should be here after I have had my coffee and NOT before…

176065961,"I have a lot of different herbs in my garden (10-15). Basil grows best in a self watering plant pot (it needs a lot of water) Mentha (peppermint) is a very aggressive herb and can spread itself, so it’s best to grow in a pot. And it can grow in the shady part of the garden. Most other herbs just need a lot of sun, a lot of them flowers beautifully - especially sage. Good luck, and just ask if you have any questions."

176065963,"I have truly experienced providence. I was laying in my bed one night and I heard something fall in my other room, didn’t pass any heed on it. Got up the next morning and went in to get dressed and seen cow 699s tag lying on the ground. I had gone through a lot with that cow when she had a big calf and was paralysed and stayed down for six weeks, eventually I had to put her down which was a release for her, I picked grasss for her every morning always making sure she was comfortable too and tried my absolute best for her, it was a lot of labour. Anyway I kept her tag and put it up on my wall to remember her. Recently I was unsure whether I should farm or not and I believe this is a sign from my father that I should keep farming because he seen how well I took care of 699 and she is with him. I also had a similar sign in hospital when I was going through photos just before the voices would start and I zoomed in on one photo and there she was standing in the background with the sun beaming behind h
er, I believe that was a sign too. What do you guys think,?"
174358728,"I don’t remember all the meds they gave me in the hospital, but I’ve been on risperdal, zyprexa 30mg, ability maintena, abilify 30mg, and now latuda 120mg, so far latuda has been the best. But everyone’s different. Weight gain on all of them has been very serious."
176065964,"I get blood work regularly and haven’t been told anything is off. I can certainly always get more sun, though."

174358729,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology in obsessive-compulsive disorder: an empirical study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience , May 25 2019 The differential diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders can be difficult. In the current diagnostic criteria, basic concepts such as obsession and delusion overlap. This study examined lifetime schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology, including subtle schizotypal symptomatology and subjective anomalies such as self-disorders, in a sample diagnosed with OCD in a specialized setting. The study also examined the differential diagnostic potential of the classic psychopathological notions of true obsession ('with resistance') and pseudo-obsession. The study involved 42 outpatients diagnosed with OCD at two clinics specialized in the treatment of OCD. The patients underwent semi-structured, narrative interviews assessing a comprehensive battery of 
psychopathological instruments. The final lifetime research-diagnosis was based on a consensus between a senior clinical psychiatrist and an experienced research clinician. The study found that 29% of the patients fulfilled criteria of schizophrenia or another non-affective psychosis as main, lifetime DSM-5 research-diagnosis. Another 33% received a research-diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder, 10% a research-diagnosis of major depression and 29% a main research-diagnosis of OCD. Self-disorders aggregated in the schizophrenia-spectrum groups. True obsessions had a specificity of 93% and a sensitivity of 58% for a main diagnosis of OCD. In conclusion, a high proportion of clinically diagnosed OCD patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. The conspicuous obsessive-compulsive symptomatology may have resulted in a disregard of psychotic symptoms and other psychopathology. Furthermore, the differentiation of obsessions from related psychopathological phenomena is insuff
icient and a conceptual and empirical effort in this domain is required in the future."

Well, technically, the AP’s were prescribed to me, but I didn’t take them because I didn’t believe that I had a psychotic disorder, and neither did my mom. I have both. I do have intrusive thoughts that are associated with unpleasant imagery and shít like that, but I also have intrusive thoughts that sound like voices coming from different areas in my mind. I also have voices that sound like they’re coming from inside my ear, like a whisper from the inside. I also have classic auditory hallucinations, that is, voices and sounds that sound like they’re coming from something in my environment (i.e. the type of hallucinations that your average _NAME_ thinks of when someone with schizophrenia). I have other hallucinations too, but voices are the ones that I have the most often, and they’re usuall
y the most vivid and complex. The sole exception is that I hallucinate my cat everywhere. Honestly, I think that just makes you human. The conscience doesn’t really begin to develop until we reach young adulthood, because as children, our parents take on that role. When you’re 12, your parents will punish you for your poor choices. When you’re 20, your mind will punish itself for making these mistakes."

I had to do everything for him, chauffeur him, nurse him, cook and clean and shop. He did nothing except earn the money by getting tenants for his places. He sat at home all day smoking and demanding my company. I had no chance to do anything productive because I was so weary of looking after him. We argued constantly. We abused each other verbally. We are both mentally unstable. So how can I live with him even if I love him? You can still love a man you divorce. My sister is divorced twice to the same man and said she still loves him even though he was abusive. But she remained friends with him and they have better relationship that way.

174358743,"I’m 31 and got sick at 22 years old. I do have a mental illness, maybe something like mild Aspergers + schizoaffective disorder or even treatment resistant schizophrenia or mild Aspergers + schizotypal personality disorder + addiction issues. I don’t know. It’s been around 9 years since I went “crazy” and lost my mind. I think aliens are ??????? with me as well as some “Illuminati types” for lack of a better word and I might have alien DNA or might even be a ??????? alien myself. I’m in a time loop probably with mind issues or possibly a causal loop, though my gut instinct, which is usually spot on and right, says time loop, despite the contrary and what other people say and think. I have no issues with wormholes anymore or going in one and I don’t have the interest or ability to build a time machine. I hate time travel and it probably doesn’t exist. Some days I’m getting better but at a cost. The real illness or damage is the mind ??????? or memory loss and trauma from mk-ult
ra and other crap I’ve been through. As the memories come back, I’m healing and getting better but I doubt they’ll ever let me make a full recovery and get a job and education – I believe my library job was ruined by them. It all started in college around 2011 and maybe I invented some ???? in high school or community college, but there’s this voodoo magic crap going on is ruining my life. I think currently some “powerful” people destroyed and ruined my life and the aliens told me the universe repeats itself like in “K Pax” movie and “Slaughterhouse 5” novel. I get memories from other dimensions, no doubt about that. It’s like my mind was uploaded to a computer or something and maybe I got some sickness from energy drinks too. The sad part and hard part to understand is this has been going on for eternity for a lot of cycles. I keep zig zagging into other timelines and dimensions after I die and keep coming back to this ??????? shitty, ugly reality. It all started in college like I sai
d and I am starting to remember stuff that really did happen to me. Some stuff definitely did not, but it’s hard with psychosis because it happened in other realities that don’t technically exist and I’m in this reality here now trying to make a recovery before I feel like giving up and ending my life. Probably have before and I just loop back in time to start over. I have limited to no memories before 2010ish like I just woke up or was cloned or had my sentience come back by God/AI or time travel “deities”/physics for lack of a better term. I honestly and geniunely think somebody or some groups of people are trying to make me insane and look insane even though I might not even have schizophrenia. Every time I start remembering stuff I doubt the totality of my illness and the abilities and competence of the doctors and see how evil humanity truly is and how God is right. I’ve been schizophrenic over 8000 times living the exact same life with mostly failures and worse outcomes than now. For the lon
gest time, I never made it this far like “Edge of Tomorrow”. I can definitely die or perish like everyone else except I go back in time with memory loss (physics) and seeing and talking to the same damn people like eternal recurrence. I can change reality or the time line and I never wanted this gift. It’s worse than hell. It feels like the movie “ARQ” a bit. Like the simulation cycles through every 9000 loops or so and then everyone minds’ get wiped again so I could have lived trillions or more lives and been on different planets or simulations. I’m like the oldest guy here technically lol. I even believed and thought the universe was shaped like a Torus. I’m pretty convinced and that this explains our artificial reality and reverse entropy and stuff due to the nature of the universe. I learned to understand and believe no-one can help me. I am a tragic character in a simulation. Some really bad stuff happened to me and it messed me up for life/eternity. I should have never went to that schoo
l/college and went to that poor house and I was too stupid to try and ignorant in wanting to serve my country – never did even though I wanted to. Maybe I did in a past life, I don’t know. I doubt it. I got alien DNA and I can travel backwards in time after I die for eternity, but I ended up with severe DP/DR and schizophrenia. I feel and am like a commoner and peasant. I’m poor and pathethic. I’m a loser too! I tried getting help so many times and I just run into the same damn people who don’t believe what or some of what I have to say. I believe I was targeted in college and I think it had to do with corrupt, evil people. I had a normal life before high school as far as I can tell. I think I showed or was interested in joining the NSA as a kid – like a lot of kids – but never did and it was about a video game, but that could have been a parallel universe or a delusion or false memory. In some of my other lives or past lives, I have memories of stuff happening to me in middle school like I was 
taken. I have other memories too like about my early childhood that I remembered in elementary school, but it’s all about cloning, reincarnation, tabula rasa, aliens, Illuminati, and time travel and stuff so it’s not really real anymore or in this reality. I just assume this life is like my normal life but I have these strange memories of being in Monarch and possibly some other crap too… I feel bad for my family for putting up with my illness and condition. I think they were cloned too (since 1970s from a past life memory recall) but they don’t know or realize it. I don’t know. I have memories of past lives and other lives, which no-body believes or anything. I sometimes doubt it too. In a past life, I was told stuff like I was in Monarch, Mk-Ultra, Montauk, a super soldier, an alien, a clone, in the Illuminati (I think), and other stuff. I thought I was brainwashed with dissociation and mind control, but I have since recovered and honestly love God and Jesus more than anything. I really don’t kn
ow what else to say. I can only talk about what happened to me in this life repeatedly and other lives I think about or recall but there seems to be limited point and interest. I do feel like I need help and want help. Deep down inside, I’m a normal, good person with empathy and compassion just like most folks here. I also feel like this forum is helping me and I honestly want to stay alive and stuff but I also feel discouraged and sad and crap. My family is tired of hearing me and so you guys are the only people that listen and care. I have no real life friends and don’t want any. I even feel like this stuff is offensive to most people and people are being tired of me talking and don’t want to interact with me anymore. I also get scared too by speaking my mind and about my experiences… My biggest want and need is to escape this simulation, escape the time loop forever, not get reset for eternity with the same struggles, and a permanent cure for schizophrenia. I also wanted to relive or go back to my 
childhood or relive a different life way before 2010-2013. From my perspective, I had the perfect childhood until university. I don’t know. It seemed perfect. Basically pot and stuff ruined my life 9 years ago. I tried it in high school in a past life/parallel universe and became schizophrenic because I remembered stuff. I hope to avoid this same mistake in the next life and never attend college again and avoid these evil sick people. I also thought I was in the SSP too, but I don’t know. I tend to think the mars thing was fake and ???????? like VR/Mind control. I don’t know. It really doesn’t matter. The future is more entertaining and important to me and to move forward in life. I want to get better…I probably got brain damage because I lost a lot of IQ points from schizophrenia and have no motivation at all in life. I often wonder if they planned this all along because it’s so advanced and eternal and I don’t even have the schizophrenic genes or family history as far as I can tell. Also, some 
things were out of my control and not my fault. I don’t know what causes or caused my schizophrenia but I don’t think it was a coincidence and I think it’s my purpose in life to have it. Trauma? A virus? Both? I don’t know. I hope to get cured some day. Basically I’m trapped in this time loop and my consciousness is being affected. It’s been going on for near eternity and infinity. I just want it to stop and I think aliens did it to me. Sometimes aliens are protecting me and helping me, while other times not so much. I think the simulation is on repeat and is stuck on repeat for eternity and thus most things won’t change despite my hope and pleading and the only way for a better life is to escape and be a better person. I often feel like I escaped before and put it on repeat for lack of a better reason and I got stuck here. Thank you!"

176066027,I use to watch this chemistry lecture series. Never did get very far…
176066028,I go through patches of giving up. It’s just a rough patch.
174358745,"Doesn’t look good for me so far. Ok, how about this? I know that one of the symptoms of a schizophrenic-psychotic-episode, is seeing “coincideses”, but there are “big coincideses and little coincideses”. My next episode introduced me to the idea that “this entire thing” is simply, reproduction. There’s some clever physics involved, but it’s possible…Anyway, I won’t go into it all, but it led to what I would term a “BIG coincidese”: During an “episode”, I was suddenly told/or told myself “Go and watch YouTube now!”. It was the middle of the night, I was naked, my father was taking the dogs out…I smiled, raced past, loaded YouTube… “Now what?” A wall of videos to choose from…? “That one!” Roxette - Joyride - I’m not allowed to link it apparently, but it’s easy to find. Now, if you took the time to watch the video, you probably didn’t notice anything odd, but from my angle… I have just been told that I have a soulmate, both “here” and “ther
e”, and that this whole thing is about reproduction. And, that this whole thing is really just a multiverse spitting out “babies”, if you will. The video opens with what could be two travelers meeting again after having been apart for a long time. - Soulmate both here and there? We meet here? Then there’s a clip of the two of them reflected in the hubcap of the bus tire, and the letters spell out “brid” and enough of the “g” that the brain can extrapolate an “e” to spell “bride” - We have to meet and marry? I’ll use the lyrics to try to walk you through the “coincidences”. I’ll probably miss some of the video contents ones, but I’ll try not to. I’ll do so as if I were actually “there”, if you know what I mean? Thing’s change. Here goes: “Hello, you fool, I love you C’mon join the joyride” Covered above. “I hit the road out of nowhere I had to jump in my car And be a rider in a love game Following the stars” Pre-Big-Bang = nowhere? I came from “nowhere”? 
Love game = reproduction? Following the stars = Traveling the Universe “being” every sentient lifeform in order to reproduce “truly just” beings like ourselves? We both have to find ourselves, and each other? ""Don’t need a book of wisdom I get no money talk at all"" Yup, that’s me in a nutshell right there. ""She has a train going downtown She’s got a club on the moon And she’s telling all her secrets In a wonderful balloon"" Hmm…I always did feel like the moon was looking down at me, but nah. “She” is supposedly the one who’s been telling me all this already. ""She’s the heart of the funfair She’s got me whistling a private tune"" – She starts to whistle, then it cuts to her whisling reflected in the hubcap of the tire with “bride” on it. Yeah, but, we have to actually marry first? “And it all begins where it ends” – Merry-go-round and monkey in background for the begins bit, quick cut to bus for the ends bit. Life here – Transportation to “there”? “And she’
s all mine, my magic friend” She’s your mum and she’s talking to me. Oh, and apparently, she can do a bunch of stuff that I can’t. The “on-the-moon” one, not the “somewhere here” one. ""She says, ""hello, you fool, I love you C’mon join the joyride"" Join the joyride"" “C’mon, believe.” - Very convinsing, but not proof. ""She’s a flower, I could paint her She’s a child of the sun We’re a part of this together Could never turn around and run"" A child of the sun? - So there is a “here” one too…And we’re both truly just? ""Don’t need no fortune teller To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no"" – Cuts to male, female and bus. “'Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah” – Introduction of pair floating above. “And we’re all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)” Superstition out too? Good, tick vg. “Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah” There’s some form of “birth” to come for all of us? ""She says, ""hello, you fool, I love you 
C’mon join the joyride Join the joyride"" ""She says, ""hello (hello), you fool (you fool), I love you (I love you) C’mon join the joyride"" Be a joyrider, ow"" “C’mon, believe.” - Very convincing, but not proof. “I’ll take you on a sky ride” – Up on surfboard now ""A feelin’ like you’re spellbound The sunshine is a lady Who rocks you like a baby"" – The guy on the surfboard tosses his guitar to “himself” on the ground. Some form of control shift between the me here and the me there? Rebirth, but don’t worry about it, I’ve got your back? ""She says, ""hello (hello) you fool (you fool) I love you (I love you) C’mon join the joyride"" Join the joyride"" ""Hello, you fool, I love you C’mon join the joyride Join the joyride"" “Hello, hello, you fool, I love you” – Visually a birthing scene? ""C’mon, c’mon join the joyride Be a joyrider"" “Roxette” – The word “roxette” is broken both verbally and visually and thus sounds like “Rock!”, “Set!” with a qu
ick cut to the “bride tire” for the “Set!” part. A manic highway, and a monkey in the background, becomes the bus waiting in the desert, and the door swings open. It was then pointed out to me (or I realised), that the video also works perfectly for someone coming at it from the perspective of a “child” in the scenario. There’s a lot there, and it’s entirely possible that I’d seen that video before, and somehow my subconsiuos remembered it perfectly, and built this whole “delusion” around it, but… C’mon. Then there are smaller, but still “quite big coincidences”, like my favourite artist releasing a new video that was, bang on the nose, title and lyric-wise, according to the information gathered up to that point during that “episode”. Oddly, it also played another very strange part: After I had watched the video a couple of times, I moved on. Later I was told, decided…To watch it again, but a funny thing happened. There is a “button-push” a few seconds into the video, a
nd as soon as my favourite artist presses the button, another video loads. Yup, you guessed it, a video that’s bang on the nose for where I am now, “episode-wise”. For a couple of days I don’t get to watch my favorite artist’s new video, because it keeps loading other videos when my favorite artist presses the button. To be honest, I am leaning towards schizophrenia being a reality for me, but if that’s the case…How’d I get so bloody lucky? Well, I guess, if this is a multiverse of all possible universes, this one had to be possible. So maybe you’ve all got one somewhere too."

It’s one set of stairs and my daily goal is 10 so It’s up and down for a bit then jogging again. Helps me get my breath back but all signs are good. Ie heartrate etc. Have a wedding next week and it’s a three night stay down the coast. Will have a good time but will be a bit restrained.

174358771,Hello I have been diagnosed with both DID and Schizoaffective. I have 10 identified alters but we believe me to have more I’ll just describe some of my experiences for you. My schiz and my DID show up in different ways. Though I do admit its hard sometimes to tell apart symptoms because they do overlap. The main thing with my DID is that I black out. Or feel like I’m in the back seat of my body. In these periods of blackout though I act like an entirely different person. Because my body is being controlled by another person. For example i don’t normally clean my room but sometimes I black out and when I wake up my room will be spotless. Or I’ll find ive eaten a bunch of a food i dont like. Etc. Now when it comes to voices thats a bit more difficult to tell apart. But certain voices I recognize as alters. Though i do believe I hallucinate my alters voices at times. But alters can be very complex and its not odd for us to argue about things like what to eat or wear. Now with schiz I mainly bas
e it on my odd beliefs andother hallucinations. Cause DID does not inherently cause symptoms like paranoia and visuals. Now another thing about my alters is they range a lot in personality age and many other things. Like I have one alter who’s been a child the whole time theyve existed we estimate them to be like 8 another alter is about 30. The child behaves in ways a child does such as playing with plushies and taking naps. The 30 y/o takes on a much more caretaker role making sure our body eats sleeps and cleans. Now I can’t say for sure what diagnosis you have. But if you have other questions about my experiences feel free to ask!

176066108,"Turns out the doctors I saw were wrong. They said zoloft couldn’t have possibly had anything to do with my bladder issues (even though they only started upon getting to a high dose of zoloft, improved when I would quit zoloft and would get worse when I went back on) and that it couldn’t possibly have caused me long term bladder issues. I can’t even tell you how many doctors told me this. Well guess what? New research is out showing SSRI’s, ESPECIALLY ZOLOFT, can cause bladder issues like cystitis and incontinence that can last INDEFINITELY EVEN AFTER QUITTING THE MEDICATION. Not only that but these studies have found that it is NOT EVEN A RARE OCCURRENCE and is actually a lot more common than previously thought!

But one thing I’ve noticed, though, is that, for example, when I’ve parked my car far away, and I’m leaving the house to go to my car, I will actually feel motivated to run on my way there, and I’ll actually start doing it; when I run in that way I don’t get tired like I used to get when I was on invega. Another thing I do that might count as cardio is, for example, going up stairs 2 steps at a time, and that doesn’t leave me tired at all Most, if not all, of my time in the gym is spent on strength training, but now that I think about it, I might go running someday (because all this talk about running has made me want to go run ) and report back in the next update"

176066120,An old song I wrote and recorded about ten years ago.
176066121,"you can take my point of view with a pinch of salt or not it’s up to you, but to me, anger by itself is of no wrong, it when you vent this anger onto those that are innocent, then you would be wrong. what is wrong with venting your anger onto those that caused you the pain. what i meant here isn;t punching the person, but reasoning with them. give them points where maybe you warned them before hand yet they still did it with your warning at hand. if they refused to listen to you and starts being unreasonable. then this kind of people do not need any reasoning, i would walk away and be quiet, let them say their crap because they are saying nonsenses. yet to them they sounded as if they are reasoning. in simplier form i would say this is self-defense. you are attacking the person with valid reasoning because the very person attacked you first verbally. _NAME_ A_PERSON_A _PERSON_"
174358780,"I’m thinking of writing a book called Schizophrenic Musings. It’ll be about my experiences, beliefs, opinions and knowledge I gained as I learned, grew with and overcame my schizophrenia. Topics would be love/fear, belief/knowledge, reality/illusion, science/religion and other things I thought about as my life grew more and more restricted with my mental illness. I am 40 years old now and dont have much to do. It would be even more useful if I had people I could bounce ideas off of since its still in the think stage. If it’s ever finished, it will be published as a free epub…probably on the Smashwords site. Anyone interested?"

174358776,Welcome to the forum. Believing that you have some kind of implant is a common delusion in schizophrenia. Have you spoken to a psychiatrist? Are you on any meds if you don’t mind me asking?
176066129,I hope you are right. I get really depressed because I feel like it’s a sign that I have to die soon. I’m really religious so I feel like everything is a sign.

176066138,"You’ve really opened my eyes, _AT_MENTION_ ! I used to eat portion sizes about the size of the front of my fist when I was at that retirement home (and I weighed under 150 lbs. then too).

176066171,It went pretty smoothly and easily and I made good money. I know I’ve been complaining a little about work lately but I think I’m gonna make it. I see work usually goes two ways in the beginning It’s always initially good then dips off. Then the third stage is where you truly understand how you really like it. And today was better than yesterday. Yesterday freaking sucked. But today I told my boss my parents were from the Bronx and he kept asking me questions throughout the day and he likes me more now. Because he’s from the Bronx too. I like my boss maybe the second most of all my co workers which is cool.

So I ended up telling him I think the mayor is putting me under surveillance (I had paranoia and delusions of grandeur) . And he thought I was suicidal. It’s really embarrassing it pops on my head time to time. He ended up telling my family and it became news. It’s just tiring to be known for embarrassing things or to be talked about.
174358800,"Neuron-Glia Interactions in Development and Disease It is becoming increasingly clear that glial cells play a crucial and dynamic role at the synapse during the critical period when neural circuits are formed and refined. The Stevens lab seeks to understand how neuron-glia communication facilitates the formation, elimination and plasticity of synapses—the points of communication between neurons—during both healthy development and disease. A major goal of our lab is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent synapse elimination during health and disease, with emphasis on the role of microglia and immune molecules in this process. Using the visual system as our primary model system, we employ a combination of live imaging, molecular, biochemical and neuroanatomical approaches. In one line of investigation, we focuse on the role of neuron-glia-immune signaling in the patterning of neural circuits. We recently identified an unexpected role of glia and component
s of the innate immune system in synaptic pruning. We found that astrocytes promote neuronal expression of complement C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade. C1q binds to synapses and is required for synapse elimination in the developing visual system. As one of the primary roles of complement in the immune system is to mark unwanted cells or debris for removal, we hypothesize that C1q may be similarly “tagging” unwanted synapses for elimination in the brain. Importantly, we found that C1q becomes aberrantly upregulated and is relocalized to synapses at early stages of glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases suggesting a similar elimination mechanism may be in place. Our current studies are aimed to define cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying complement dependent and independent synapse elimination during development and disease. Current research questions include: How are CNS synapses selectively targeted for elimination? Is complement-dependent synapse elimination 
an activity-dependent process? What is the role of astrocytes and microglia in synapse development and elimination?

176066179,keep it simple. Live in the moment…really that means on concentrating on what your doing and not getting too far ahead. Put your energy into everything you choose to do and do what you like doing. Lots of things you won’t like doing but do what you can well. Keep expectations low. If your not putting pressure on things your doing you’ll be pleasantly surprised when you get better outcomes… Take the pills. Keep friends. Engage where you can with others. It all helps.

They are able to think, and have their own free will, emotions, and memories. In short, a tulpa is like a sentient person living in your head, separate from you. another thing is I made this go away before, and I brought it back into my head, can you do that with schizophrenia?"

I find that the girls in my league who are attractive are usually messed up according to the online dating thing. I never leave my room and have no reason to anymore.

174358816,I feel like humans intuition definitely gets better as times goes on. I’m 29 year old I think almost anybody who’s a certain age has better or the same at LEAST intuition as me. My theory is schizophrenia makes our psychic and intuitive abilities much worse. But if you recover from it you can recover your intuition too. But I think humans are more psychic than we give credit for. No one is psychic like miss _NAME_. But everyone is more intuitive and perceptive then we think. Or maybe how I used to think. Maybe most humans are in on this secret??? And I’m just recently getting in on the secret. Due to recovery from sz I have recovered my own intuition to understand other people’s perceptions too. And I couldn’t see it until I recovered it myself?? But now I see how perceptive humans are. But I wasn’t very perceptive when I was psychotic. Would you say my statements and thought processes are true??

It’s not in a BPD sense where I feel a lack of identity and don’t know who I am, but in a “I can be almost anything I want” way. I know who I am, it just isn’t very important."

But the body naturally breaks down tyramine to get rid of it. This usually prevents the tyramine from causing high blood pressure.

Some of these medications used for depression include phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), and others."

176066243,Well my intent is to eventually be a nurse practitioner and get into therapy. Everyone I know says I’d be good at it. I think to be a good therapist you have to a) be a good listener b) not get freaked out easy. It also helps that I’ve struggled with severe mental illness before so I can understand more than the average _NAME_ would.

When he tries to push your buttons, just say, “Whatever”. Try to keep your kids away from him as much as you can. If he isn’t paying child support you might have a good case to do this. Get support for friends and family to do this."

My thinking was foggy, and much, much slower than before. I just couldn’t play anymore and basically, still can’t. I started on Risperdal Consta back in 2008."

176066363,I’d say he’s right. The medical literature is outdated Schizophrenia just doesn’t get much coverage because it is so highly stigmatised I highly recommend modafinil though. I’ve been using it nearly every day for nearly two years and I have MASSIVELY improved in willpower. Still tired but I can fight it. You also feel happy on modafjnil. I think it’s the dopamine mechanism it has. No psychosis for me either.

I don’t want to put up with them either. A lot of clowns in the hospital – good and bad ones. A lot of people want attention and act out.

Alexithymia has also been observed to predict psychosocial functioning in SZ. We investigated whether alexithymia predicted social and everyday functioning in BD, as well as transdiagnostically in HC, BD, and SZ patients. 56 BD, 45 SZ, and 50 HC were administered and compared on tests measuring neurocognition, social cognition, functioning and alexithymia. We conducted linear regressions assessing whether alexithymia predicted functional outcomes in BD. Next, we conducted hierarchical stepwise linear regressions investigating the predictive ability of neurocognition, social cognition and alexithymia on everyday and so
cial functioning in our overall sample. BD and SZ patients were comparable on most demographics and demonstrated higher alexithymia compared to HCs. In BD, alexithymia predicted social functioning only. In the overall sample, difficulty identifying and describing feelings predicted everyday functioning; difficulty describing feelings predicted social functioning. Results suggest that aspects of alexithymia significantly predict functioning among these psychiatric groups, above and beyond the contributions of previously identified factors such as neurocognition and social cognition. Results may aid in developing proper interventions aimed at improving patients' ability to articulate their feelings."

The opposite is true. Being lost and in thought and not realizing it is the default mental state. Observing what appears in consciousness is another, but usually that’s only during meditation.

So No. They don’t. They help over placebo and most of us are out in the community over 60 years ago where we were in institutions!

I feel blessed and highly favored. And with all the deferent places I have been shown death is not the end of our journey just a stepping stone to the next next. I feel that god talks with me too. I pray silently in my head n I believe anything is possible now that I’ve been enlightened and I come up with designing my own heaven. I’m gonna have multi colored fireflies when I get there. Lol but I truly do. I was told that I will never be alone again that good sent me protection but also feel as though whenever it is time for me to pass on that it will be my protector who kills me. I do have an intrusive thought that one of the voices says to me. I’m gonna take ur breath. I’m not scared of it though I feel as th
ought I’m sitting in gods hand and for his will to be done. I’m ready even though I want to live a long life. I’ve been sz for seven years now but didn’t get visual until a ur and a half ago n proper diagnosed till then also. I could hear them and feel them and think I have been in training for this since this stared. I’ve already died spiritually 3 times during sum episodes I’ve had before even buried myself once. But even though it was my third time and I have been able to retain the memory’s this time but the first two times I would forget. Sz has effected my memory but since I’ve been stable an on my meds gaining my memory back some.

For example, it is hard for organisms to breathe both in air and in water. Organisms either breathe in water or in air. Not both. So in conclusion, maladaptations must exist for humans to continue evolving. There is a theory that autistic traits were selected to have hightened senses.

When I was young three billion people lived on the earth, and two thirds of them lived in dire poverty. Now six billion people live on the planet, and one third of them live in dire poverty. In both cases that means two billion people live in dire poverty. I wouldn’t worry about it if their poverty just meant driving pud cars and bad fashion statements, but these people really suffer.

176066525,"_AT_MENTION_ That’s concerning to gain that much weight that quickly. You definitely want to keep monitoring your weight and make sure you can still take the new med. They don’t all cause weight gain. If you’re moving around more and not eating that much worse, there’s no good reason to gain weight that fast. Hopefully it evens out for you so you can stay on your med. _AT_MENTION_ YAY you! Congrats! _AT_MENTION_ It’s definitely better to only weigh once per week. I know there are websites that say you should weigh every day to stay “accountable,” but it’s the best way to drive yourself crazier. There’s too many day-to-day water fluctuations that come into play. Once a week is plenty. I sometimes get tempted to jump on the scale mid-week if I “feel” like I lost weight, but I try to be good about it. I just tell myself I’ll be that much happier on Saturday."

176066592,"I’m short winded times during the day. But I know exactly what causes it. I thought I had some mysterious illness that was causing me to be fatigued but after getting checked by a doctor including blood tests I realized it was because of too much inactivity. The doctor found a couple things wrong with me but they weren’t the reason for my fatigue. I can work three days a week even though I’m tired and slow but I know it started in the board & care home when I was staying in my room for 3 or 4 days a week, laying down surfing the internet. I had to share a small room and it was such a relief to have it alone when he left for the night that I often stayed in my room right after supper to when I went to bed. And I kept that habit up. I go out now about 3 or 4 nights a week and I go out usually every day. But I’m pretty sedentary and it’s the root of my fatigue. When I had to go in person to the college bookstore a couple times more than a year ago a flight of stairs damn near killed me. I go
t to the top exhausted and had to lean against a wall for ten minutes until I got my wind again. So if you’re getting tired it might be your age and too much inactivity. Sugar could be contributing too. Stuff is not good for you. Read up on how bad sugar is to your body."

176066604,"I had to drop my Christianity and the bible to get out of my delusions, they were toxic for me and that’s why religion is banned in this forum."
176066605,I’ve tried it. Didnt do anything. Didnt feel like it helped at all.
176066606,"I was feeling OK, relaxing in my sisters apartment switching back and forth between here and YouTube. I thought I heard a woman laugh upstairs. I thought it was at me but now hours later it might not have been directed at me and I might have even just imagined it. But then thinking of all the times that people laughed at me, sometimes for no reason, and at first I got mad and then I just got really depressed and had serious doubts about my whole life. I hate that one tiny blip of an incident can send me into a tailspin and even change my life."
176066607,A few days. It’s like my meds are just barely keeping me sane.
176066608,I’m sorry that happened it might be worth seeking legal advise. I know I was kicked and punched a few times so my aunt helped me get out of there because even the manager thought it wasn’t safe there for me. I was out within 3 weeks.
176066609,"im sza. I used to have lots of manic episodes like you described. giving me a euphoric upper feeling for a few hours most days. where I would plan things or start on projects. this went away with meds. now I get depressed but rarely have ups anymore. part of it, is where I live now, compared to where I used to live, I get depressed and bored living out in the country. it’s still common for me to bite off more than I can chew still, for example I tend a garden and am gung ho about it in the early spring, but the realities of it prove to be more than I care for. also I used to have manic episodes lasting days, I would go on trips, drive across the country or hike hundreds of miles in days."
176066610,"I played alone too. Well, with a whole group of friends that I made up. I didn’t really have issues connecting with others I don’t think. I wasn’t shy or anything. I just preferred to live in my own world. _PERSON_…"
176066611,Oh no _AT_MENTION_ ! How did you chase them? What did you do to them? This is not a good thing. Get yourself to the ER right away! They can press charges on you.
176066612,My parents know and its ok with them as long as I am not in or causing trouble. I still don’t tell them everything I do here.
176066613,"So my therapist told me that she was going private practice last month. I decided I’d follow her over there and just keep coming to the public clinic for my meds. But today, my NP told me that since I’ve been stable on the same dose for over a year, she thinks I can start going to my PCP for meds, and I could be discharged from the clinic entirely. I’m not sure what to do. On the one hand, it will be cheaper to see my PCP once a year instead of a specialist every three months. And I dislike my current NP, so I wouldn’t be sorry to see her go. On the other hand, I’ve been going to this clinic every month for the past 6 years, and it will be weird to no longer be there. It’s fairly low risk. Since it’s the public clinic, I can just get a walk-in appointment at any time if I decide to come back. But I’m nervous about this. What do you guys think I should do? Go to your PCP Stay at the public clinic 0 voters"
176066614,Yeah it was indeed…
176066615,"You mean Abilify or Invega? I am confused, Abilify is better for cognitive and negative symptoms than Invega for some ppl. Find something to do thats more compatible with your sz?"
176066616,"I’m not sure I understand Quixotic, I hope you’re not talking about me, I know I went off on one yesterday, I apologize if it seemed too off-topic"
176066617,Firstly folk who look at other peoples phones without permission are dicks. Second tell your brothers they are also dicks for their views. In short your brothers are dicks
176066618,I read the following: Civil War Times Bookmarks Games All great magazines. I get them in the mail.
176066619,"I see people, it can be people ive met on facebook. They pop up in my head sometimes."
176066620,"I’m sorry that happened. I would give it sometime until everything cools down and then try having a talk again. She’s your mom, and I am sure she loves you."
176066621,"That’s how I feel, but I do know I have a tendency to focus on things until they become obsessions. Maybe that’s what she thinks I am doing."
176066622,"There’s something called confirmation bias. That means, you notice when things confirm your delusion, but don’t notice when things don’t. If you think about a thousand things in a day, odds are, some of them are going to be things that actually happen."
176066623,I got my records when I applied for disability. To be honest they were pretty bland and reflected the 5 min intervals I normally spent with my pdoc. I’m guessing I got disability based off diagnosis because based off his records I seemed a lot more stable than I was.
176066624,"My voices sometimes start the delusions. Other times, I have an epiphany, or I wrack my brain trying to either make sense of my thoughts, justify my hallucinations, or explain the behavior and motivations of others. The best way that I can explain my psychosis is that my mind feels like it’s imploding in on itself due to the pressure of all the chaos going on in my head."
176066625,Two more weeks and I’m completely weaned off of lithium! I’m so happy about that!
176066626,try to not overthink those things… just live your life. it’s all just labels and they are not all that you are.
176066627,Sorry for your loss
174358906,So _PERSON_ recommended dose didn’t cause you any positive symptoms? Im willing to try it even if I know its placebo…
176066628,"Hmmm… Perhaps this? Dissociative disorders** are mental disorders that involve experiencing a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. People with dissociative disorders escape reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy and cause problems with functioning in everyday life.17 nov. 2017"
176066629,Can sz be sexy? I think i makes it look cool
176066630,Wow! That’s great !
176066631,I’d probably die if I took a cold shower. Shock to the system!
176066632,"Realising no one can help you better than yourself. If you don’t do anything, then it is up to you to change it. No one else can really help you. Tough fact to realise, but knowing this might motivate you to get up and do something. Of course, you could continue to do nothing due to med caused avolition, but even still it is still up to you to change things because no one else will."
176066633,I think people look at us and think we look able enough People physically disabled dont. And yes they do discriminate They are afraid of us they don’t understand k
176066634,"I don’t buy or eat bacon, so I don’t have a clue. Avoiding nitrates."
176066635,"I’d like to know that too, because my pdoc just prescribed me one last week and I don’t know if I should take it. I feel flat as well although get mood swings too."
176066636,You’ve already taken the first step and that’s to talk about it. I really hope you can work through this with your peer…
176066637,"I did it a couple years ago. It seemed like my gene-drug interactions just required me to take higher doses of those drugs, especially if I was a smoker. I think it was useful info to have. Here’s what my AP results looked like: 1302E6E9-5658-4788-9B9C-2505033D35A0.jpeg 4023×3017 2.34 MB _USER_ID_: Looking over my other results, I did get a warning for “reduced efficacy” for Paxil, which I was on for years and thought worked just fine. So I guess your mileage may vary. It might be a helpful starting point, but like _AT_MENTION_ suggested, it really comes down to trial and error."
176066638,I vape but that doesn’t make a burning smell
176066639,"Risperidone worked well for me. My mind was a mess and it really pulled me out. I did have to keep increasing my dose though. It can make you feel flat, and I also gained some weight. But I was amazed at how quick and effective it was."
176066640,_AT_MENTION_ thanks
176066641,"Ye I cry to songs too, but only when I am psycotic:)"
174358894,"Yes, I believe I am well-spoken. However, I majored in English, so that helps. When I don’t know people, I tend to resort to a lot of big words. Heteroclitic is my favorite."
176066642,_AT_MENTION_ how’s it going?
176066643,"I feel like I have no worth and I’m just wasting everyone’s life. My parents wish so much for me to get better but I can’t because it’s chronic. I can’t make my body feel ok again. I can’t grant their wish and now I feel powerless. I feel like I’m wasting their lives. I’m wasting time, space, money by existing. I’m no good. I need to be eliminated."
176066644,You’re the best _AT_MENTION_ . I love your posts
174358909,"that’s really sad. In a far off way it reminds me of my mum, she has depression and self medicates with lots of food. I find it painful to witness. she is morbidly obese and Ive heard her say to my dad that she doesn’t like herself at night when they were in bed :(( Did she know you suffered from psychosis? Maybe it was to do with you…? maybe not"
176066645,"I hate to disagree, but I’ve had 3 separate series of ECT. It helped my depression. No antidepressants worked at all until ECT. They put you under with anesthesia and induce a seizure. That seizure resets the brain, for lack of a better word. Please do your homework before you declare something barbaric. I’m available to answer any questions that you have."
176066646,"Just cathartic autobiographical writings. Jottings, scribbling, writing down some prose some thoughts. Some things about my life. Got a couple thousand words. Maybe I’ll write more later. It’s not very organized but it’s organically written so there’s that"
174358895,"But, the Doctor said the sound filtering problem since childhood is also related to the Schizoaffective. Schizoaffective is more than what I thought it was. I still cannot comprehend well. It could be related to the Schizoaffective, too. I also used to obsess a lot and had compulsions. But, this has been wiped out since awhile. I think Abilify was the medicine that wiped it out. My therapist suggests these obsessions happen in Mania. My therapist is a Cambridge guy, so I heed him, too. Means, again, it is the Schizoaffective. It means that 17 onwards till 25 I am going through replete depression, mania, and Psychosis. Before that, I just have mania and depression. More mania than depression. That is why I have the symptoms of OCD then, as well. The symptoms of not being able to focus, inattention, etc may be related to the Schizoaffective Depression. Means I have Depression since childhood, as I vividly remember staring blankly in the classroom. So, in essence, it is just SAD and Schizoaffective. B
ut all the various ways in which they combine, it is nevertheless a pathetic combination. Now that the Schizoaffective is treated, all I have to do is try."
176066647,I currently work one 4 hour shift a week. Sometimes more when I fill in for other volunteers who can’t work their shifts.
176066648,Any of you know? I’m just wondering…if my chronic avolition part of borderline disorder or is it sza?
176066649,I hope you don’t need to be either! Remember though not to let things get out of hand and see the GP as early as possible if you notice any problems. My GP doesn’t mess with psych meds

176066655,_AT_MENTION_ i doubt it honestly
176066656,"I save my PIP money as before I got it I was break even on my expenses, so I am using it for supporting me when I am unwell as I don’t get much sick pay at work. It has been a massive relief. I now don’t have to go into work when I am not feeling well, and it has given me some financial stability and less to worry about when I do get unwell."

176066665,"I was in that position for many years when I was depressed and suicidal. Then, later after my depression was gone, I was stagnant and in a stagnant relationship and stayed stuck in the present and the Now for many years. Right now, that relationship is over and I’m starting to think about a new life and a new future of possibilities."

176066669,"I’m just saying that the symptoms, not the diagnosis, are important and the symptoms are our behaviors that we can modify"
176066670,"I can relate. You just described my routine more or less. It takes me about an hour and a half every morning to unlock all the joints. Then after I eat dinner, I can’t help but crash for a few hours. Then I’m awake until one or two… Sometimes the whole night. It gets on me sometimes"
176066671,"I enjoyed your new music composition _AT_MENTION_. I hope you’re able to get some sleep and to awake refreshed and able to focus on your studies. I posted this on another thread a few days ago, but one of my go-to videos for when I have severe insomnia is this Slow TV train video from Norway. I find it boring and soothing and also scenic. Plus it’s 10 hrs long so if I wake up again, it’s still playing and puts me back to sleep."

176066677,"My childhood was mixed, but there was quite a bit of real happiness in it. I would get the most intense crushes on these girls. They hurt. In the first grade it was _NAME_, in the third grade it was _NAME_, in the fourth and fifth it was _NAME_, in the sixth, seventh, and eighth it was _NAME_. It was like a total obsession. I do remember real happiness, mixed with my obsessions, exploring the woods and going on hikes with my friends. When I turned fifteen my life became very cold and bitter. It was miserable."
176066678,"My life has gotten better and better ever since I decided to be med compliant. One day I had enough of being psychotic and living with one foot in darkness and the other in the real world.And I finally accepted that I had a medical illness. And that this illness required a medical treatment i.e. psychiatric medication. I’ve had relapses, but mostly due to me doing clinical trials. But I always get help when I need to and get back on the meds I need."

If you can stand up to him physically I would just go ahead and make coffee, but if you can’t you just got to be smart and avoid him. Maybe you can come to a arrangement to leave each other alone if you don’t get along, but that you have as much right to use the kitchen as he does."

176066684,Favorite Metallica song…FadeToBlack How did that affect your relationships if you don’t mind me asking? I have had great difficulties in expressing myself during psychosis when I tried hiding it. Led to many an argument and frustrated moments and hopelessness for me. I am finding my accepting of it more and more liberating.

176066689,No one is reading your mind! No one wants to watch you in the bathroom for sure! Unless you have the Numbers in your head to the powerball or lottery no one wants to read your mind! Delusions and paranoia are what’s going on. You need to call your pdoc and get help.

176066691,Although I’m rather sensitive to the sun’s glare I’ve not worn sunglasses for a good number of years. I certainly wouldn’t wear ordinary sunglasses as everything would be blurry if I did . It would have to be tinted prescription glasses. I guess if I went out more I’d consider it .

176066700,This happens every time I try to quit cigs too. Doesn’t make much sense to me.
176066701,Sometimes doing something with movement like dancing or active can help you when you have too much energy. Repetitive movement like carving or painting large pictures is helpful.
176066702,"_AT_MENTION_-Cotton You’re waffling on your posts and saying you don’t say things that you do. You asked how to get the med out of your system before 4 weeks and never mentioned pills. We’re not going to tell you how to get off any med. We’re a pro med forum. All You’re going to hear is to talk to your pdoc. Trust them. Please, please stop seeking a way to get around your diagnosis from us. We’re not doctors and no one here is qualified to help you aside fron offering support. Telling you how to get a med out of your system before the 4 weeks is NOT support."
176066703,"my pdoc can only take so much of me at once (because I’m not just schizophrenic… Ive gone mad.) so I am still waiting to talk to him about meds.

I’m doing better today, I think I just got confused from this thc cbd 1:30 ratio oil I took. weird how even 1mg of thc with 30x of cbd can mess me up so bad"

176066705,I like it. Good job.
176066706,I appreciate the kind words winter. I’m really going for it this time. I’m going to jump and hopefully there’s a net. Just hope taking to therapist really helps. Although talking on here helps me realize there’s people like me to.

176066708,Good _AT_MENTION_ you’re doing the right thing. I hope this takes some of the pressure off of you.
176066709,Agree with _AT_MENTION_ that dwelling on the past isn’t good. When I fixate on specific events from the past its often when I’m deeply unhappy with what is going on around me and I’m just finding a way to distract myself from it or to make sense of it. That said I’m glad you had a piano teacher that was helpful to you. I had a few teachers in my youth who I really looked up to and their interactions with me were really important to me. I try not to think about them because it makes me feel blue.
176066710,Yeah I find most of the cases very sad I will stay on my meds and comply with treatment
174358912,"yeah im a little better now than before. I was majorly depressed and had anhedonia for the first 14-18 months, but then I started to adjust to the meds I guess and got better. im also on a lower dose now, so that is helping. it’s an ok med for me, but I don’t think I would recommend it either. im curious about other meds, namely the abilify injection, as I read it’s not supposed to raise prolactin. but others have said abilify was no good. im just content to stay on this med and see how it goes. things are improving this last year and a half."

Can anyone recommend any other meds for treatment of akathisia? Is there workarounds for Propranolol, like you know it’s screwing with your emotions so you just try and brush it off?

174358913,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:_PHONE_NO_ EndHTML:_PHONE_NO_ StartFragment:_PHONE_NO_ EndFragment:_PHONE_NO_ I was diagnosed as bipolar schizophrenic in 2008, but although I share some commonalities with schizophrenic sufferers, I have nothing that even remotely resembles bipolar disorder. Given this, and my personal doubts about my having schizophrenia, I’d like to describe my first “psychotic episode” to “fellow sufferers”. I placed the quotes around “psychotic episode” because: a) It can also be called a “psychotic break”, just a “break”, or just an “episode”. b) I’m still not sure that’s what it was. I placed the quotes around “fellow sufferers” because: a) I’m still not sure if I’m one or not. b) Suffering? I’m not suffering, I’m on the ride of my life here! Anyway, I can’t really find any good sources of information, like detailed descriptions of “breaks”, to help me to determine any similarities. So, I’ll describe my first episode, briefly, in the hop
es that some of you may be able to identify with, or dismiss the events as not schizophrenic. As if woken from a dream, I suddenly noticed myself screaming at my own mother for serving me brown spaghetti. It was not like an out of body experience, it was just sort of…BAM!!! “There you are!” ”Take a good look at yourself!” “Look at what you’ve become!” I stopped mid-sentence, turned a left. Alone in my room in the dark, I cried, and resolved to change. I had heard the analogy of the brain being like a ski-slope somewhere, and figured that I could slowly change myself that way. However; after a couple of hours thinking back on my life, looking for pivotal moments, things got very strange indeed. Suddenly I was seized by something. It was as if I were two separate beings occupying the same body, and something external to myself too. My thoughts suddenly became religious in nature. I’m a firm agnostic, leaning towards atheist if I’m honest, so this was quite shocking to me. It was like: “So 
you thought that you were really clever did you?” “You thought that you had all of the answers, now look what you’ve done!” At this point, I am moving violently on my bed, kicking for extended periods, laying rigid as a board for extended periods, and “being put through” various terrifying, awe-inspiring, devastating, glorious… Scenarios, with emotions so powerful that I had to force them to shut down, because they were getting so intense that I thought that I may actually suffer physical brain damage if I didn’t. An odd thing happened at this point, I fought back: “No, no, no, I won’t be a part of it!” “It’s unjust!” “Do what you will with me. It just doesn’t work!” Now things got really odd, and I mean, I’d already been Satan, and Jesus, but now I was God. Somehow, I was both myself and “God”, and I had placed myself here, to see if I could find my way home again. To see if it worked? Or, to fix “myself”? The next part was essentially conversational, I don’t rem
ember anymore violent movements past this point. I/we(?) spent the rest of the night agreeing terms on the best way to go about achieving what I/we(?) want. Which is: Every being, past, present, and future to be truly happy. When I said “essentially conversational”, I did so for a reason, because there was another very big part too. I was tested, or tested myself, on my love of humankind I was presented with more and more terrifying scenarios to endure in order to prevent a single one of you “being lost”. It felt like I was being examined for any tiny, little flicker of doubt within me, as I was asked to “Clap your hands if you are prepared to endure that, to save them all.”. Which I did each time, without a second thought. Anyway, there were a lot of very intense emotions, and it all ended up with me being the only being left here, alone, cold, and in darkness, for eternity. Which for some reason, to me, is the worst possible thing to have to endure forever. After all, you get used to anything ev
entually, but not that, not now. It was as if I were being tested, examined, file-checked, or debugged throughout this segment. Little errors in thought (mainly assumptions), got pointed out to me conversationally, but more severe errors resulted in jolts of varying intensity. The “jolts” were both physical, and emotional at the same time, like a flush of embarrassment, or a wave of fear, depending upon the situation. I got out of bed the next morning, truly just, and therefore truly happy, with the ability to control my emotions. Unfortunately, I did still think that it might be possible that I was “God”. I say “possible” there because, I don’t care how “believable” something might be, I need proof. Since then I have been through approximately 2-3 episodes a year, each showing me new things, teaching me new things, and making me think through things, so that I understand more and more. But still, no proof. Lots of odd things, like… _NAME_ died March 14, 2018. _NAME_ was born March 14, 187
9. And I, on hearing of _NAME_’s death, had within the hour, figured out how I could be both me here, and me-much-more-powerful somewhere else at the same time. It all has to do with _PERSON_’s “Imaginary Time”, and the fact that in a block universe, all time is present all of the time…But anyway, the physics lot haven’t poked any holes in it thus far, but like the “Big Bang”, it cannot be proven at this point anyway. I use this as an example because, I was not experiencing any schizophrenic symptoms on that day, and nor did I for a couple of days. Then, I had an episode that made all that physics stuff clearer to me. The likelihood is, that I do have schizophrenia, but at least I did get rid of that “I’m God” thing. It’s so simple really… I’m truly just. I don’t want to be “special”, a “god”. If being truly just is possible, it would be a basic requirement of any being worthy of the epithet “God”. Because I’m truly just, I don’t want to be “special”, or a “
god”. Therefore; “gods” can’t exist, only false ones can. I’m truly just therefore; I’m truly happy. I love every being, past, present, and future because, I understand. I want every being, past, present, and future to be truly happy of their own freewill. Am I sick?"

176066725,"sometimes I wish I was homeschooled. I went to a private school from kindergarten to 2nd grade, then my parents couldn’t afford it anymore and I started going to public school. when I got to public I was way ahead of the curriculum, particularly in math. my state test scores were always very high, and I made straight a’s up to the 6th grade. then I started to become more interested in sports and spent all my time playing basketball so I started to get b’s. I think in some ways public school is inferior. and lots of behavioral problems in public. if I had my own child I would want to send them to a private school or homeschool them. I had a couple friends that were homeschooled. they were very intelligent but didn’t have the same social adjustments as the kids in public school. when it comes to universities I think, state universities are a good value. lots of specialized degrees in math, science, and other fields. whereas a lot of private liberal arts colleges I think are a waste of money."

174358916,I rejected my main delusions. that helped reduce the hallucinations because the mind had less of a narrative to go on. The brain still likes to look for different narratives to take on though. So it doesnt really go away it just loses power if you can logically deduce and reject the delusion. That is of course if you can even realise its a delusion in the first place. im an outlier as well and you shouldnt really look to my experience.

176066867,"Yesterday I had 2 tattoos. First the symbols of anarcho communism, and second just a word “_PERSON_”"
176066868,"I used to work at a hot tub/massage joint in the eighties when there was a kind of a boom in those places. Just to top it off there was a small restaurant inside too. And to really top it off it was a sushi bar. Right about the time sushi was first getting popular. We also had an isolation tank when those were kind of rare. Anyways, we had 11 different massueses and one massuer. It was a relatively small place run by a fairly young married couple and there was only about 7 employees. Man, the memories are flooding back. There was also a woman who was a Rolfer. “Rolfing” is kind of like a cross between massage, chiropracter and yoga, it was very hip and trendy back in the eighties. The woman who did the rolfing was soooo sexy. And soooo stuck up. She had a pretty big ego and her and the boss had some confrontations. Yeah, I worked there four years from ages 23-27. I started the job 9 months after getting out of an 8 month hospitalization. The bosses gave every employee one free massage from ever
y massuese. Stupid me, but I didn’t take advantage of it, I got only one massage. I did the isolation tank a couple times for free. I was kinda scared to do it because the movie “Altered States” had been a big hit just a couple years before and it was a thriller about how some people had gone in an isolation tank and freaked out and turned into killers or monsters or went crazy or something. But the boss offered and I tried it and was sorely disapointed in the experience. It was so anti-climatic, not scary at all. We called it “a float” because it was filled with salt water and you climb in, shut the door and floated without sinking for an hour and a half. It almost put me to sleep. We charged like $20 for a float. Yeah, it was quite an experience working there. The first year I was psychotic as hell even though I was on a huge dose of prolixen and was heavily sedated. IDK, just some interesting stuff was going on in my life at the time. I moved around a lot, I had friends and even though I was in t
he mental health system, I had a semblence of a life. I had a car and lived in nice places, I even dated a little. Did a lot of fun things. I had a friend and he had a best friend and I got introduced to him and we hit it off and became friends. He was really into music and had a huge record collection. I remember his two favorite bands were “The Smiths” and “Rush”. He had all their records (this was before CD’s). He was an interesting guy, kind of a rough guy, really cool and kind of a ladies man. He was about 20 and had three girlfriends at the same time and a host of other women who were ex-girlfriends or just women he slept with. Like I said, he was really into music and we used to drive up to San Fransisco and Berzerkly and go to all these hole-in-the-wall record shops and buy rare records and bootlegs. I ended up being friends with him for about three years. Anyways, yeah I was in my twenties living in an affluent college town, being in the mental health system I lived in semi-independent livi
ng but I made friends with “normies” and other schizophrenics alike and I was kind of in mainstream culture and an outsider at the same time. I used to hang out on Stanford University campus and go to frat parties and go various places on campus. I went to fancy clubs and ate out at nice restaurants. Unfortunatly, I became addicted to crack. That changed my life for sure. Now one day I would be eating dinner in the fraternity cafeteria or going to the campus theater and the next day I was in the ghetto smoking crack and snorting coke with complete strangers and driving all over hell and back again trying to score. IDK. Looking back, my dad was right. My dad hated what I was doing with my life back during my drug days and never wanted to talk about it but one time he gave me an off hand compliment and told me, “Yeah, you were living life in the fast lane.” Anyways, I sure got around, but made a lot of mistakes in my life back then, a lot of bad choices that could have got me badly hurt or even killed. 
A typical thing was when I was trying to score some crack in a park and had sixty bucks in my shirt pocket. I was sitting on a log with a few strangers and this dude walked up and saw the money and strong arm robbed me. When I resisted, someone snuck up behind me and broke a wine bottle over my head. I wasn’t hurt too bad but I was soaked in wine and surprised and somehow, some guy who knew me walked up and kind of led me away from the park. That’s my war story. Tons of other bad stuff happened to me in my addiction on a daily basis, but I won’t get into it. I got clean in 1990 and turned my life around. Enrolled in school, got a new job, started going to 5 or 6 AA, CA, or NA meetings a week. Left the drug life behind and moved out on my own, got a car, made friends who didn’t do drugs. Got the trust of my family back, got a busy and productive life. IDK, my life wasn’t the best back then but objectively, it wasn’t that bad. I can say that I had my ups and downs."

176066895,"Hi All, Wondering what people’s thoughts are on what the cause of psychosis is / can be. I know that its common knowledge that it can be caused by recreational drugs or even stress in pre-disposed people. But a lot of what I’ve heard from doctors is that I’ve had psychoses because I’m pre-disposed. That’s it. Any attempt to explain environmental triggers on the lead up to my episode(s) is met with distrust in me and my reality, with them suggesting to me that it was all a dellusion. And they had me convinced at the beginning. But after multiple repeat occurances and a lot of learning, I now believe that the only dellusion that I’ve had during an episode is dellusion of belief. Influenced by - (i) hyper-sensitivity to / hyper-awareness of sub-text. After a lot of reflection I do not think that I have had any type of hallucination (visual, auditory or otherwise). And on further reflection I believe that each of my episodes have come during periods of my life when I have felt or been disem
powered. I’m usually quite empowered in my everyday life (climbing the ladder in the corporate world). However I believe that every episode that I’ve had had been preceded by: A lapse in my own self-awareness; Followed by my interactions with others being affected (letting biases visibily get in the way of our interactions, getting frustrated, etc) Which then spirals (except in cases where the other person is explicit and open to me about it) in to a political situation Which is followed shortly by the feeling of hyper-awareness, reading sub-text in to what others tell me (some of which I’ve been able to validate, some of which I have not) Which then spirals in to highly abnormal belief patterns. As of maybe the 3rd of my 4 episodes, I’ve been able to identify, at the hyper-awareness stage, that I am entering a psychosis and have communicated this to trusted people around me. Overall, my belief is that the cause of psychoses (at least in my case) is: Psychosocial disempowerment Filters are Stripped Aw
ay Information Overload combined w/ lack of knowledge about particular aspects of social interaction, communication and information theory and potentially a lower than normal level of self-awareness Leads to the brain attempting to extrapolate reason for particular information packets Results in dellusion / jumping to the wrong conclusion (due to lack of knowledge/awareness around all of the new information that is now hitting your frontal lobe) What are people’s thoughts about this hypothesis?"

176066944,"Yes I have Autism. It was not diagnosed until I was 32 and it blew my mind in that I could finally see why things growing up had been so hard. Literally, I spent about 3 months unpicking everything in my head, and it caused me some instability and of course - anger. I was at school in England during the 90’s and early 2000’s. They did not really focus on it much then If only they had put me in front of a specialist, rather than excluding me all the time for my disruptive behaviour. It was really tough, as I was severely bullied and taken advantage of at school especially. These people knew exactly how to take advantage of my social flaws. Now Autism is my strength, as I know my logical thinking comes into play very heavily, which my case manager says is a positive thing, and I agree It’s not all bad. I am not completely debilitated by my Autism, but it makes things very hard dealing with people. My paranoia, anxiety and so called depression I think would not be as amplified if it wasn’t for 
this. I also have zero social life. Have spent years online trying online dating and meet ups etc, but I have failed. If it wasn’t for my family I’d be alone all the time. It really isn’t fair that they have to take the strain - especially my parents"

176067035,"I was outside smoking a cigarette. I hope everybody gets better like I did, but I still hear voices; some people like ninjastar also had their hallucinations stop. I’m really hoping that happens, if that happened I wouldn’t feel disabled at all anymore. They still talk all day though, they are nice to me and don’t give me commands and they don’t try to convince me of stuff like they used to, but it’s distracting. I can drive safely now but haven’t owned another vehicle since I crashed the old one back in 2015. I moved to California and don’t know the roads, otherwise I woulda bought me a nice used chevy by now. Most doctors from what I’ve read say that hallucinations are easily treated but delusions are very hard to treat, so I should just be glad I don’t have those anymore I guess. Could I work a job? Maybe. I haven’t tried since I was really sick. I think the voices would distract me and make work impossible unless I could get a delivery job or work from home."

176067087,"I will tell you guys something. Please realise that this is my connection, and my connection, only. Reproducing the idea without due credit would be plagiarism of the highest level. Psychiatric diseases can lead to the change in the shape of the nose, change in the shape of the jaw, change in the skin tone, change in the texture of hair, and change in the color of eyes. If you change a lot (facially), you may have a psychiatric disease. In fact, this should be the number one marker to evaluate a person for psychiatric diseases. A person as high as 10 can become 1 because of psychiatric disease. There can be a relationship between Psychiatric Diseases and Chronic Maxillary Sinusitis: The former can cause septal deviation, and thus affect Chronic Maxillary Sinusitis. Also, Septal Deviation may lead to nasal congestion. Not all people who have Chemical Imbalances in the brain will change, but those that change certainly do have this imbalance. These people change all the time, then. There looks can be 
as high as 10 without medications, and as low as 2 without medications. Psychiatric medications can help improve the looks to a large extent, and make them somewhat, terse. Why is this idea important and revolutionary? And, when I send it to scientists, why is there apathy towards it when I list the potential benefits? Diagnoses. So many people will be diagnosed using this criterion Early, instant Diagnosis It can revolutionise Psychiatric Research and provide a fascinating glimpse into Co-morbidity. Why? Because, people with this glitch will be noticed earlier in life. When the symptoms are since childhood, there is clearly a higher chance of having: Developmental differences More than one Psychiatric Disorder When I look at my various pics aged 1, I am both a 10 and a 2. Therefore, I am certain my disease is post-natal. Lastly, so many more people will seek treatment because medications help the looks. They get a bad reputation because of weight gain, but this will provide the medications a positive light. 
I have finally said it here. I rest my case. Now, it is upto the scientists to show more intention to further research this idea. I vividly remember having thoughts aged 7. But, my illness was clearly lurking in the background before that age."

174359005,"I invariably find articles in Quanta Magazine to be very interesting and well-told. Now surely they will do some research into “dopaminylation” in schizophrenia. It will be interesting to read about this. # The Epigenetic Secrets Behind Dopamine, Drug Addiction and Depression As I opened my copy of Science at home one night, an unfamiliar word in the title of a new study caught my eye: dopaminylation. The term refers to the brain chemical dopamine’s ability, in addition to transmitting signals across synapses, to enter a cell’s nucleus and control specific genes. As I read the paper, I realized that it completely upends our understanding of genetics and drug addiction. The intense craving for addictive drugs like alcohol and cocaine may be caused by dopamine controlling genes that alter the brain circuitry underlying addiction. Intriguingly, the results also suggest an answer to why drugs that treat major depression must typically be taken for weeks before they’re effective. I was shocked 
by the dramatic discovery, but to really understand it, I first had to unlearn some things. “Half of what you learned in college is wrong,” my biology professor, _NAME_, once said. “Problem is, we don’t know which half.” How right he was. I was taught to scoff at _NAME_ and his theory that traits acquired through life experience could be passed on to the next generation. The silly traditional example is the mama giraffe stretching her neck to reach food high in trees, resulting in baby giraffes with extra-long necks. Then biologists discovered we really can inherit traits our parents acquired in life, without any change to the DNA sequence of our genes. It’s all thanks to a process called epigenetics — a form of gene expression that can be inherited but isn’t actually part of the genetic code. This is where it turns out that brain chemicals like dopamine play a role. Quantized A regular column in which top researchers explore the process of discovery. This month’s columnist, _NAME_, is a neu
roscientist studying the cellular mechanisms of brain development and plasticity. See all Quantized Columns All genetic information is encoded in the DNA sequence of our genes, and traits are passed on in the random swapping of genes between egg and sperm that sparks a new life. Genetic information and instructions are coded in a sequence of four different molecules (nucleotides abbreviated A, T, G and C) on the long double-helix strand of DNA. The linear code is quite lengthy (about 6 feet long per human cell), so it’s stored neatly wound around protein bobbins, similar to how magnetic tape is wound around spools in cassette tapes. Inherited genes are activated or inactivated to build a unique individual from a fertilized egg, but cells also constantly turn specific genes on and off throughout life to make the proteins cells need to function. When a gene is activated, special proteins latch onto DNA, read the sequence of letters there and make a disposable copy of that sequence in the form of messenger RNA
. The messenger RNA then shuttles the genetic instructions to the cell’s ribosomes, which decipher the code and make the protein specified by the gene. But none of that works without access to the DNA. By analogy, if the magnetic tape remains tightly wound, you can’t read the information on the cassette. Epigenetics works by unspooling the tape, or not, to control which genetic instructions are carried out. In epigenetic inheritance, the DNA code is not altered, but access to it is. This is why cells in our body can be so different even though every cell has identical DNA. If the DNA is not unwound from its various spools — proteins called histones — the cell’s machinery can’t read the hidden code. So the genes that would make red blood corpuscles, for example, are shut off in cells that become neurons. How do cells know which genes to read? The histone spool that a specific gene’s DNA winds around is marked with a specific chemical tag, like a molecular Post-it note. That marker directs other p
roteins to “roll the tape” and unwind the relevant DNA from that histone (or not to roll it, depending on the tag). It’s a fascinating process we’re still learning more about, but we never expected that a seemingly unrelated brain chemical might also play a role. Neurotransmitters are specialized molecules that transmit signals between neurons. This chemical signaling between neurons is what enables us to think, learn, experience different moods and, when neurotransmitter signaling goes awry, suffer cognitive difficulties or mental illness. Serotonin and dopamine are famous examples. Both are monoamines, a class of neurotransmitters involved in psychological illnesses such as depression, anxiety disorders and addiction. Serotonin helps regulate mood, and drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely prescribed and effective for treating chronic depression. We think they work by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain, which boosts communication between neurons in the neural 
circuits controlling mood, motivation, anxiety and reward. That makes sense, sure, but it is curious that it usually takes a month or more before the drug relieves depression. Dopamine, on the other hand, is the neurotransmitter at work in the brain’s reward circuits; it produces that “gimme-a-high-five!” spurt of euphoria that erupts when we hit a bingo. Nearly all addictive drugs, like cocaine and alcohol, increase dopamine levels, and the chemically induced dopamine reward leads to further drug cravings. A weakened reward circuitry could be a cause of depression, which would help explain why people with depression may self-medicate by taking illicit drugs that boost dopamine. But (as I found out after reading that dopaminylation paper), research last year led by _NAME_, a neuroscientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, showed that serotonin has another function: It can act as one of those molecular Post-it notes. Specifically, it can bind to a type of histone known as H3, which control
s the genes responsible for transforming human stem cells (the forerunner of all kinds of cells) into serotonin neurons. When serotonin binds to the histone, the DNA unwinds, turning on the genes that dictate the development of a stem cell into a serotonin neuron, while turning off other genes by keeping their DNA tightly wound. (So stem cells that never see serotonin turn into other types of cells, since the genetic program to transform them into neurons is not activated.) That finding inspired _PERSON_’s team to wonder if dopamine might act in a similar way, regulating the genes involved in drug addiction and withdrawal. In the April Science paper that so surprised me, they showed that the same enzyme that attaches serotonin to H3 can also catalyze the attachment of dopamine to H3 — a process, I learned, called dopaminylation. Together, these results represent a huge change in our understanding of these chemicals. By binding to the H3 histone, serotonin and dopamine can regulate transcription of DNA int
o RNA and, as a consequence, the synthesis of specific proteins from them. That turns these well-known characters in neuroscience into double agents, acting obviously as neurotransmitters, but also as clandestine masters of epigenetics. _PERSON_’s team naturally began exploring this new relationship. First they examined postmortem brain tissue from cocaine users. They found a decrease in the amount of dopaminylation of H3 in the cluster of dopamine neurons in a brain region known to be important in addiction: the ventral tegmental area, or VTA. That’s just an intriguing correlation, though, so to find out if cocaine use actually affects dopaminylation of H3 in these neurons, the researchers studied rats before and after they self-administered cocaine for 10 days. Just as in the human cocaine users’ brains, dopaminylation of H3 dropped within the neurons in the rats’ VTA. The researchers also found a rebound effect one month after withdrawing the rats from cocaine, with much higher dopaminylation of H3 
found in these neurons than in control animals. That increase might be important in controlling which genes get turned on or off, rewiring the brain’s reward circuitry and causing an intense drug craving during withdrawal. Ultimately, it looks as though dopaminylation — not just typical dopamine functioning in the brain — may control drug-seeking behavior. Long-term cocaine use modifies neural circuits in the brain’s reward pathway, making a steady intake of the drug necessary for the circuits to operate normally. That requires turning specific genes on and off to make the proteins for those changes, and this is an epigenetic mechanism driven by dopamine acting on H3, not a change in DNA sequence. To test that hypothesis, the researchers genetically modified H3 histones in rats by replacing the amino acid that dopamine attaches to with a different one it doesn’t react with. This stops dopaminylation from occurring. Withdrawal from cocaine is associated with changes in the readout of hundreds of gene
s involved in rewiring neural circuits and altering synaptic connections, but in the rats whose dopaminylation was prevented, these changes were suppressed. Moreover, neural impulse firing in VTA neurons was reduced, and they released less dopamine, showing that these genetic changes were indeed affecting the brain’s reward circuit operation. This might account for why people with substance use disorder crave drugs that boost dopamine levels in the brain during withdrawal. Finally, in subsequent tests, the genetically modified rats exhibited much less cocaine-seeking behavior. To put it plainly, the discovery that monoamine neurotransmitters control epigenetic regulation of genes is transformative for basic science and medicine. These experiments show that the tagging of H3 by dopamine does indeed underlie drug-seeking behavior, by regulating the neural circuits operating in addiction. And, equally exciting, the implications likely go well beyond addiction, given the crucial role of dopamine and serotonin s
ignaling in other neurological and psychological illnesses. Indeed, _PERSON_ told me that his team’s latest research (not yet published) has also found this type of epigenetic marking in the brain tissues of people with major depressive disorder. Perhaps this connection even explains why antidepressant drugs take so long to be effective: If the drugs work by activating this epigenetic process, rather than just supplying the brain’s missing serotonin, it can take days or even weeks before these genetic changes become apparent. Looking ahead, _PERSON_ wonders if such epigenetic changes might also occur in response to other addictive drugs, including heroin, alcohol and nicotine. If so, medicines based on this newly discovered epigenetic process could eventually lead to better treatments for many types of addiction and mental illnesses. In a commentary accompanying the research, _NAME_ of Sorbonne University in Paris made a final, intriguing observation. We know that typical neural impulse firing works by ca
using a ripple effect of dynamic changes in calcium concentration inside neurons that eventually reach the nucleus. But _PERSON_ noted that the enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of dopamine to H3 is also regulated by levels of intracellular calcium. In this way, electrical chatter between neurons is relayed to the nucleus, suggesting that neural activity — driven by a behavior — could attach the dopamine epigenetic marker to genes responsible for drug-seeking behavior. That’s how the experiences one has in life can select which genes get read out, and which do not. _PERSON_ would be proud."

I drilled at it for years searching for answers I, for the love of god couldnt understand how someone in a room could look at me and diagnose me based on my mood with not one medical test being done. It drove me more insane than the SZ itself ! I changed Pdocs so many times to get different opinions and try understand psychiatry. I read every single thing about it i could find online, it consumed me It was difficult to come to terms with though. You have cancer, here the tests that show it. You have Diabetes, here the tests that show it. Schizophrenia "" na you talking shiit doc "" show me proof ? Its a personal journey that takes time. ALOT of trial and error and self discovery. Ive found my own methods that work. Psychiatry is trying, its still in a complete infant stage. Think about how big the window of psychiatry is, Its tiny tiny tiny, which led to even more of my frustrations Coming back to th
e part about searching for psychiatrists led me to finding one, a very good one who understood what i was after. He helped me alot, he understood my frustrations and gave me options. He said he would throw the dsm out the window if it would make me feel better. I challenged him and psychiatry and after many long talks, he helped me deal with my thoughts, meds and my goals of where i want to be in life ! Maybe you can search for a good therapist, that might give you the answers you looking for ?

176067277,Citcoline improves working memory and also reduces anhedonia. It raises norepinephrine and also creates uridine which in turn increases dopamine receptor density which is the mechanism behind anhedonia reduction ability. It helps with OCD if OCD is caused by poor working memory or dopamine deficiency. If OCD is due to serotonin deficiency then it can worsen it. Too much of citicoline can worsen depression may its another reason feeling bad on it.

176067302,"That’s what they are there for…They get paid to help you. I would call unless they are literally closed. If they don’t answer come in. It’s more important than posting here. Plus, you should really go to a hospital and get on disability. It might not be a lot but you will be alone someday and need to learn these skills. I’m learning too and it’s hard. As my parents get older, you see who truly puts in the effort and walks the walk instead of talking the talk. My father pays for 99% of my things. No one else. Everyone else just cares about themselves. They have money. They work. No one calls me anymore unless I initiate the conversation. Disability isn’t guaranteed anymore. I have to work someday which is why I try so hard with new meds and stuff. I could try 1000x harder if I was homeless or quit the drinks. It would be survival of the fittest on the streets and I would have to pull myself up from my bootstraps. A lot of your stuff seems Satanic. My mom says junk in junk out when I lo
ok into dark things or conspiracy theories. Your mind is literally you and when you watch that or read that crap, it affects you. Doing positive things like even smelling good helps a ton. It affects your brain in positive ways. Usually in America, doctors are open M-F or M-Sat. Business hours. Hospitals are open 24/7. My private insurance has a 24/7 nurse hotline if need be. I use these forums as an outlet and because I’m bored and have a lot of thoughts and ideas racing through my mind. I figure I rather experiment and try to improve myself and beat the odds and grim statistics than not try at all. I want to change my outcome and destiny by 5+ years in advance. I don’t really care about things like Lung cancer really. I care about being sane and working and making money. I’m 30 now and I want to have +$500k-$1 million in the bank my 40-50 if I survive that long which is a crapshot. I figure I need 2-3k a month to be happy and live on. A decent apartment in a safe area is around 1-1.5k a month. I eat a 
lot and smoke and drink energy drinks. I have a car, need gas, need insurance, and have to pay for the ridiculous car registration and other minor things like unexpected expenses. Even copays can add up. I figure 2.5-3.5k is ideal in my situation. I could always move to a cheaper state or a cheaper area. I am paranoid about my safety a lot so I want to live in a safe, low crime, nice area. Nothing too fancy."

176067320,You’re better off without. I took Ativan for years and years. It was to the point that I was taking 2 and 3 mgs or more just to relax and blacking out my memory. In the end I didn’t want to give it up but it was best for me that I did. Now I take hydroxyzine and I find it’s much better. No abuse. And no memory loss. You’re best to do without and go at it on your own or try some hydroxyzine.
176067321,I look very normal. Im fit and also have handsome looks. So it just looks like how could anything be wrong. Only immediate family can tell when im off.

176067325,"The reason I ask is, Your parents seem to be really hurting your health at this point. Pushing you to work when you feel like you can’t, And discouraging you going to the hospital when you’re hurting yourself. If you’re of age, you need to consider moving out."

Try drawing sometimes, maybe in color with markers or crayon or colored pencil, different shapes, designs. Later close your eyes and you’ll see fantastic images. I always think to myself, man! if I could only draw that well! But, of course, it is a little disturbing at times to see things. Sometimes I will see an image so horrific I immediately repress the image and deny I saw anything."

174359056,"The _NAME_ model of the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. I’ve definitely gone through denial and acceptance.

I worry that I will end up like that girl. I’m honestly so scared of people that I hope that my uni does zoom calls until my degree ends.

176067375,"You should be thankful in a way. I don’t know how old you are but when you get older, time just passes by so quickly. Years fly by and suddenly you’re 40 or 50 and you’re wondering where all that time went and how the hell you got so old, so fast. At 58 years old I miss the energy I had when I was younger and I miss being so healthy when I was younger. But I like the maturity I have now (I have a great boob joke if you want to hear it, but first I have to make wee-wee real fast.) Anyways. You just have to find something to occupy your time and it can be really simple. But if you do it regularly even if you hate it sometimes it will at least hopefully distract you from your problems for a short while. It’s a big world, there has to be something for everyone, somewhere that a person can enjoy. I agree that life gets boring and mundane but at my age I enjoy life in some ways more than I did before I got sick at age 19. Hell, I even have fun sometimes on my half hour drive to work."

174359055,I’m just freaking out that I’m not schizophrenic. I read someone wrote that it’s like Alcoholic Anonymous of course they won’t support mind control theories. What if for me this is all real?
176067377,My pdoc is fairly new too _AT_MENTION_ and before I got him I wouldn’t be completely honest either. But when I got this one I had already decided to be honest percent. And he raised my meds and did that dna test that I’ll get the results in a couple weeks. It is embarrassing for me to be totally honest with him but laid it out all on the table even all the stuff I’m ashamed of. And he seemed like he appreciated the truth and didn’t act one bit surprised about anything I said. So anyway once I got over that hump I say anything I want to him. I used to care way to much about what the pdoc thought of me. But now that I was honest with him he got very aggressive about my treatment. It’s still a work in progress. But it feels good to me that he’s taking a active role in helping me. Like he really cares. The rest of them just herded me in and out like cattle and didn’t give one s h I t if it helped or not.

176067380,"That the universe began in 2011 and took 1 year to build, and I woke up in 2013. Ok seriously, that’s how it feels and my schizophrenia is. I have missing time up until my schizophrenia like 2012 was the end of the world and we now live in a different, newer reality like a computer simulation. I think these thoughts are and feelings and experiences are not random or new or that I’m the only one that has these feelings of non-existence. A lot of schizophrenics feel this way. I just try to capture these feelings and make sense of them. Like I feel like our big bang or universe before 2012 is an illusion and that the universe began in 2012 allegedly and the CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology) or big bang/black hole started in 2012. This rebooting or reseting or simulation has been going on for eternity for me. I don’t know why I feel this way. Mind uploading? How come I can tell and sense it and it seems like a rare or low probability that I can ‘intuition’ it and feel it. Can anyone help me or 
perhaps I’m over sharing. Like maybe the universe ended in 2011/2012 and for some reason I only remember the beginning of 2013. That’s what I’m trying to say. I’ve been stuck in this time loop for aeons or eternity. The past life stuff or stuff I made or created could be coming from a different aeon of sorts like information panspermia or something like it’s going through an ‘intelligent filter’ and being sent out sort of like information theory, which I don’t understand. I have thought about my mind, soul, and consciousness being digitized and sent through outer space on a laser as a pulse (hitting the edge of the universe or just another planet earth) and landing in my brain. _PERSON_ talked about this. I could be an alien or from another planet earth lol. I don’t know. I guess I sound nuts and crazy but letting the thoughts flow freely. It feels like punishment or could be replicated millions of times (the signal being sent that is); hence, the feelings of immortality. That each earth I l
and on (or the same one) feels the same or different depending on the ‘timeline’ or earth. For some reason, my past before 2013 doesn’t change and the universe doesn’t split off or branch before that year, which I find super strange and highly controversial and points to a time loop or simulation theory. There could be thousands of earths out there or the same earth. I think I’m on the same earth though. Thank you. Can anyone relate to these feelings?"

And me too, i have a strong anxiety and racing thoughts… But no matter that my thoughts race, i still have some thinking deficits… My problem is, that i waited way too long to start my treatment… I was ill for 15 years before my meds… And i dont switch my ap since 5 years. Ya know, one pdoc of mine told me, that in my case, my ap can work in years lol… And sometimes, i feel like it starts to help a bit. Our anxiety is perfide, we should first get better on our racing thoughts, which was slow for me on my zyprexa… If you already feel a small improvement on your meds, then it menas, they are working. In my case, my zyprexa was like a candy for me for 5 years, while many got calmed way faster than that… But ive accepted that i am sick, that my mind is different than for the others, so i try to be patient yeap. And i still stick to the ap… For the rest tbh, i take sometimes still a bit of klonopin though… 
Lately, i have the fear of dying from cigarettes and the smoking cough is making me anxious too… Continue talking to your doc, but there is a chance for us yeap. Me, yesterday, i was a real infirm somatically… I was all shaking interiorly (not exteriorly), i was just feeling uncomfortable in my body and many, many other things… I was denying before, that the somatics are an illness too, but yes… You’ll feel better.

174359061,"Psychiatric Times Aggression and Impulsivity in Schizophrenia Aggressive and impulsive behaviors in schizophrenia pose many clinical challenges. The best way to reduce the risk of aggression is with adequate treatment of schizophrenia. ""Aggressive behavior and impulsivity are often found in paranoid schizophrenia and can occur during both acute and chronic phases of the illness. Impulsivity is defined as action without planning or reflection, and it seems to be related to a failure of behavioral filtering outside of consciousness. Patients with schizophrenia may show dysfunctional impulsivity and impulsive aggression. Although the neurobiological aspects of aggression in patients with schizophrenia are still not well understood, impulsivity and aggression may correlate with frontal and temporal brain abnormalities.2 Psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, with subsequent suspiciousness and hostility, may result in aggressive behavior. Or, aggression may be impulsive and caused by 
an environmental frustrating event. Patients may be more aggressive and violent during acute episodes.3 Schizophrenic patients have less insight, experience greater thought disorder, and have poorer control of their aggressive impulses."""

In these situations if the patient was not restrained people would be seriously injured. That said, I have NEVER seen a restraint last more than 5 mins. And 5 mins is like a long one. More typically it’s like 1-3 mins. Usually they just hold them long enough to get them into a safe room for them to calm down or to give them a shot to calm down. Staff do not like to restrain.

My favorite hobby is reading novels so maybe it’s not surprising that I enjoy daydreaming and creating my own story lines. I wonder at what point is daydreaming considered maladaptive? Is it only if it disrupts work, school, or social interactions? Or is it the amount of time that one spends daydreaming? I will say that daydreaming is a handy way to get through boring work meetings, at least back in the pre-pandemic days when meetings were in meeting rooms. Now with telecommuting and with Zoom meetings, if the meeting is boring, one can always multitask such as answering work emails."

176067458,I have been on Clopixol since 1997. First I tried 16 mg Risperidol pr. day for 8 month but it didn’t touch the compulsions or voices. Then I went on 10 mg Zyprexa for half a year and it worked the first 5 month but then the voices returned and the the PhD added Clopixol to the Zyprexa which had been Increased to 30 mg. I improved a lot after that and had only psychosis on some occasions. I continued with this mixture for half a year before I gave up the Zyprexa because I gained 30 pounds on it. For five years I was on Clopixol 400 mg depo only. I had some severe negative and cognitive symptoms so therefore I got geodon added to the mixture. in 2012 I got seroquel added to the mixture because of Insomnia.

176067484,"I cried hard when I let go of my religious delusions. I was scared and paranoid me and my family would go to hell and burn for eternity. Even for bad thoughts. I almost drowned my kids trying to hold on to the delusions. I literally shook and trembled to the point of barfing, with fear for months until I met a therapist that explained religion to me and encouraged me to do some research on my beliefs. I began to challenge my beliefs and she helped me rationalize everything I knew or thought. I slowly gained power over my thoughts. I had setbacks, but we kept working on challenging my thoughts and slowly I gained the courage to trust what I was allowing as my truth. I learned to judge for myself if things made sense. I’m not going to lie, I still have delusions, but I have these tools under my belt to move ahead without fear. Kind of like having a _USER_ID_ in the dark. It’s not so scary once you get used to it."

I chalked many of these up to depression- but ended up finding many different things fit many different categories. i have constant anxiety about things that make little to no sense, feeling like a sinner for doing things such as self pleasure or having intrusive thoughts. i have been suicidal before but often have very vivid imaginations of loved ones dying (ie, very vivid deaths due to cars, school shootings depicting detailed and gorey gun wounds etc) which is not exclusive to just family, but pets and friends; often i feel low motivation and experience fluctuations in my eating habits, along with symptoms that seem very obviously like adhd. i am overexcitable and it is hard for me to focus and finish tasks, i am finnicky and very overem
otional, i hyperfixiate on topics akmost like a special interest (which also ties into aspergers etc,) along with these i also dissociate from time to time and often have a feeling of false superiority in topics like english, like poetry- in which i feel like i am truly the only one who understands it and everyone else is frustratingly stupid. also, i have Dermatophagia- or the repetitive biting and eating of the skin primarily from my hands joints and cheeks, but not limited to. i have been cycling through different symptoms in a desperate attempt to have comfort in what may be wrong with me but have found nothing. lately schizoaffective/schizophrenia have been a major thought to me, but i am wary. any help is appreciated, thank you so so much."

Next was 8 months in the hospital, still with none of those. But they put me on medication. After the 8 months I became fairly stable and all the crisis’s were over. I spent the entire 1980’s living in group homes and hospitals but I still worked. I’m 58 now and tired physically and mentally but still have enough energy to get by. I work part-time, I take online classes, I drive my own car, I live semi-independently. I take care of myself and I have a little money in the bank.

176067570,"One day about 6 years ago I had brought my car into the shop for some repair. I had to kill an hour or two while it was being worked on so I just took off walking down the busy street. I walked by a bus stop with a girl sitting on the bench and I kinda saw some guy standing a few feet behind her. As I was passing, the guy said something and I glanced up and saw him aiming something at me. It looked like a gun and he was aiming at me very intensely. The way he was holding it and the way he was staring at me I thought for sure it was a gun and that he was going to shoot me. I shouted out, “Are you crazy?” and stopped in my tracks scared to death. But the girl turns to me and says, “Yes, he is.” She must have been there awhile and talked to him or saw him acting weird. After, about 5 or 6 seconds I realized it wasn’t a gun, it was just an umbrella. I was shaken and I cussed at him and left. I thought I was going to be shot. It wasn’t really a near death experience but in my mind it sure fe
lt like one. I had many dangerous situations happen to me in my life where situations could have gone horribly wrong but this incident may have scared me the most."

Antipsychotic drugs are its treatment of choice, but there is controversy about which agent should be used. We aimed to compare and rank antipsychotics by quantifying information from randomised controlled trials.We did a network _NAME_-analysis of placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomised controlled trials and compared 32 antipsychotics. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, BIOSIS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov fro
m database inception to Jan 8, 2019. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We included randomised controlled trials in adults with acute symptoms of schizophrenia or related disorders. We excluded studies in patients with treatment resistance, first episode, predominant negative or depressive symptoms, concomitant medical illnesses, and relapse-prevention studies. Our primary outcome was change in overall symptoms measured with standardised rating scales. We also extracted data for eight efficacy and eight safety outcomes. Differences in the findings of the studies were explored in metaregressions and sensitivity analyses. Effect size measures were standardised mean differences, mean differences, or risk ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using CINeMA (Confidence in Network _NAME_-Analysis). The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD_PHONE_NO_.We identified 54?417 citations and included 402 studies with data for 53?463 pa
rticipants. Effect size estimates suggested all antipsychotics reduced overall symptoms more than placebo (although not statistically significant for six drugs), with standardised mean differences ranging from -0·89 (95% CrI -1·08 to -0·71) for clozapine to -0·03 (-0·59 to 0·52) for levomepromazine (40?815 participants). Standardised mean differences compared with placebo for reduction of positive symptoms (31?179 participants) varied from -0·69 (95% CrI -0·86 to -0·52) for amisulpride to -0·17 (-0·31 to -0·04) for brexpiprazole, for negative symptoms (32?015 participants) from -0·62 (-0·84 to -0·39; clozapine) to -0·10 (-0·45 to 0·25; flupentixol), for depressive symptoms (19?683 participants) from -0·90 (-1·36 to -0·44; sulpiride) to 0·04 (-0·39 to 0·47; flupentixol). Risk ratios compared with placebo for all-cause discontinuation (42?672 participants) ranged from 0·52 (0·12 to 0·95; clopenthixol) to 1·15 (0·36 to 1·47; pimozide), for sedation (30?770 participants) from 0·92 (
0·17 to 2·03; pimozide) to 10·20 (4·72 to 29·41; zuclopenthixol), for use of antiparkinson medication (24?911 participants) from 0·46 (0·19 to 0·88; clozapine) to 6·14 (4·81 to 6·55; pimozide). Mean differences compared to placebo for weight gain (28?317 participants) ranged from -0·16 kg (-0·73 to 0·40; ziprasidone) to 3·21 kg (2·10 to 4·31; zotepine), for prolactin elevation (21?569 participants) from -77·05 ng/mL (-120·23 to -33·54; clozapine) to 48·51 ng/mL (43·52 to 53·51; paliperidone) and for QTc prolongation (15?467 participants) from -2·21 ms (-4·54 to 0·15; lurasidone) to 23·90 ms (20·56 to 27·33; sertindole). Conclusions for the primary outcome did not substantially change after adjusting for possible effect moderators or in sensitivity analyses (eg, when excluding placebo-controlled studies). The confidence in evidence was often low or very low.There are some efficacy differences between antipsychotics, but most of them are gradual rather than discrete. Differences in 
side-effects are more marked. These findings will aid clinicians in balancing risks versus benefits of those drugs available in their countries. They should consider the importance of each outcome, the patients' medical problems, and preferences.German Ministry of Education and Research."

Watching Lost and that scene probably dozens if not hundreds of times helped convince me I was real, alive, and not dead. The creators of ‘Lost’ even said the characters weren’t dead the whole time, but it was all real and they were all alive and experienced what went on in the island. Crazy stuff. Just stuff that helped me realize things and get out of my delusion. I guess I thought I was multiple characters including _NAME_ and especially _NAME_ at one time because of his ‘immortality’. Right now, I’m convinced CCC (Conformal Cyclic Cosmology) is true and I worked on it in a past life in a #1 physics phd program, but I have retained no fruitful or useful memories. I think o
f _NAME_ and how my brain is damaged and broken, and how aliens can unlock things and I can build a time machine or at least in theory study physics in a different light and way. For instance, I remember seeing in my hands the Riemann Hypothesis in a past life and trying to memorize it. I got abducted by grey aliens afterwards. I don’t know what use RH has besides cryptography but I think it can be used for space travel and anti-gravity and beyond. Random stupid thoughts like _PERSON_ flow (real thing) and how prime numbers are distributed in a quantum system (energy) according to wikipedia… One of my delusions was I created the TV Show Lost in a past life or at least studied the series like a religion and became convinced about certain things. I have developed a love and obsession for the show. I think I’m multiple characters including my photo (_NAME_) due to his tragedy and pathetic life. I’ve been studying “Lost” to find the meaning of life and behind life. I think it’s about aliens, space t
ravel, and black holes. Like the island could be metaphorically a black hole or parallel universe similar to the swiss cheese universe of CCC lol. I was in a wheelchair in a past life in a different life and now I’m not. I still remember my other lives. Sometimes, people can jump between timelines or remember their past lives in other timelines during sleep. I think I can do this a lot. It’s just as real as this."
176067640,"_AT_MENTION_ Sorry to hear that you’re a victim of, cray cray via female. I’ve had a relationship that was bizarre. I can’t sit here on my soap box and say it won’t happen again. I’d rather try and lose rather than not try at all. I’m sending good vibes your way, and a hug."
176067641,"Recently hospital gave me generic Abilify (Thailand) and I felt not the same again but I am stable if given generic Abilify (India, e.g. Arian, Ariptor)."
174359134,A lot of people are on abilify due to depression- I’ve seen several people who are on abilify. Some of my friends said that it’s helpful. You should start with the lowest dose and move up to a higher dose if necessary.
176067642,i wish docs had an answer for why stuff like that happens
176067643,"I was exactly the same way. I loved alcohol. It made me feel good. Marijuana made me paranoid, and it got ideas running through my head that I didn’t like. Some guys just love marijuana. They’ll smoke it constantly. Marijuana isn’t as dangerous as alcohol because it doesn’t destroy judgement and inhibitions as much as alcohol, but marijuana isn’t harmless."
176067644,did you ever thought to switching to vaping. its a better alternative.
176067645,I nap sometimes in the morning after meds if I wake up at 2am and can’t get back to sleep

176067650,You build up a tolerance to nicotine. So you only notice it when you stop smoking.

176067653,"Im just a bit overwhelmed with my thought process. I mean life itself is a bit bonkers. We are on a mass of land floating in a vast vacuum of inhospitable conditions, where everything has to work just right or we cease to exist. They say I’m mad, look how we exist? Thats barmy. We live on a rock in this vacuum called space, and we live our lives in three different time periods, two of which dont technically exist in the physical realm because they are nothing but concepts. One, the past causes severe depression to those who live in it. Here’s lookin at myself. The other causes crippling anxiety to those who live in it because we are always anticipating the worst. Something bad is sure to happen in the future. Tomorrow Im going to get fired, or in a car accident, or robbed, ect. We prophesies our own doom until something sticks and even though a broken clock is right twice a day it proves that we can just tell the future when something bad does happen. News flash to myself, if you always believe 
something bad will happen it shouldn’t surprise you when something bad inevitably happens. Im trying to live in the present, because I believe that is all that physically exists. I am where the past has brought me and _PERSON_ going where the future will take me, but for now I am here. Here is enough. I find I dont have to worry about anything here. I have a headache and am rambling. Its 4 in the morning and I’m tired. Good night all, be present, be happy."
176067654,And now I’m 75. The part of the brain that notices time must have been damaged.

176067656,I think it’s natural to want to hide your flaws. We feel shame or embarrassment over things that others would never even notice if we didn’t tell them.
174359142,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully it will go down with time…
176067657,I usually compare what I’m hearing to a situation I’ve seen or heard. Like for instance my delusions tell me God or Jesus is helping me or talking to me or some nonsense like that and then I’ll say then how come he didn’t help that person who killed themselves or all those kids being abused etc etc. How come he didn’t show up to make a way out for his follower I heard about like that bible says. Shuts the delusion or attempt at a delusion down real quick. They like to ignore reason and logic and contradictions. lol But they’ve also told me I’m going to hell as well so I try not to listen to them about anything. I try to go back to what it was like before I had the voices and living life.
176067658,you sound delusional or semi stable however you want to say it…please tell your pdoc about it…
176067659,hope things have been better

176067667,Yeah I agree with #_USER_ID_. Risperidone is (reluctantly) your best bet.

176067670,Mirtazapine was a miracle sleep-drug for me too but due to severe interaction with Latuda I haven’t been able to take it like I used to for 5 years. I don’t know if it counts for you but with most people the lower the dosage Mirtazapine the more potent it is as a sleep-drug. The hospitals in the Netherlands even have liquid low dosages of Mirtazapine for insomnia. So if you up your dosage be aware that Mirtazapine could potentially be stimulating rather than sedating. MAOi’s are supposed to be a miracle AD compared to SSRI’s but docs barely prescribe it because of it’s diet restriction and it’s dangerous (cheese) side effects which I never been bothered with though.
176067671,"I was mopping the gym ( perfect time to think and mull things over) and a young woman soldier came in to work out. I used to freak out when I was working in the gym and people came in but now I’m pretty comfortable. I glanced at her and kept mopping. I noticed (because I have eyes) that she was kind of cute and she looked in good shape. I let her alone but I had to mop near her. I’m 59 and I’m too smart to stare or show any interest, I don’t want that reputation. I also got a little weight on me and she’s a soldier and I’m the janitor! But I glanced at her again and I noticed she was wearing a low cut shirt and she looked at me and damned if she didn’t deliberately lean over and show me a lot of cleavage. What was I supposed to do? So I looked. She looked to be 25 or 26. And then without skipping a beat I casually went on mopping and she went back to working out. Damn, it was cool and nice and everything but it made me wonder what prompted her to do it. It doesn’t happen to me often 
and it was a nice break from a blah day. I guess it had nothing to do with me, maybe she was just being charitable. It just surprised me though that a woman her age, who looked like that, would do that. Oh well."

176067679,Is it possible to have something implanted in you that can allow people to read your thoughts on their phones? My delusion first started off with thinking people can watching me on their phones but then i realized that was impossible because people talk badly about other people around me and i dont believe they would do that if i had a camera or microphone implanted on me. So im stuck wondering what could this be.
176067680,These are delusions _AT_MENTION_ No one is after you. Speak to your doctor about this. I hope you start feeling better soon.
176067681,The 1st psych appointment here in Wiltshire it was noted by my stepdaughter that I was emotionally flat . My pdoc said that that could happen with the meds. I have never been an ambitious person . My default mode even pre illness was that of a loner/moderately asocial. I don’t spend ages in bed. Indeed I’m late to bed most days.
176067682,I grew up in the country and hated it. I much prefer city life

176067685,"Well if I count all the psychiatrists I’ve had, I’ve had 5 total (in 13 years). There was only one that I didn’t think was very good at his job. He always asked me if I heard voices, if I was well, if was unwell, if I was somewhere in the middle - he would ask me. And I have never heard voices even when I’ve been unwell, so it was very frustrating. Kind of like asking someone if they have hand pain when they’ve had a foot injury - just an irrelevant question. To me it was quite dehumanising I felt like he was just judging me as a statistic and not as an actual person/patient."
176067686,u have to take your meds to recover at first
176067687,"I hear about this through my grandmother. My grandmother said that the Japanese wanted to kill Koreans.

176067690,I’m independent and still have my youngest daughter who is 17 is living with me every other week and see her often when she is at her dads place. I have enough money to live a good enough life. My oldest daughter who is 21 and youngest son who is 19 both live on their own. My 23 year old son lives with this dad. I guess I just figure soon they will not longer need me.
174359151,"Must be the millenial generation. My brother is like that. It doesn’t bother me though. I’m happy for him. I kind of wish he would just move out and grow up and not save all his money for a duplex and buy all these fancy things. He’s still young: 22 years old. But I was 500 miles away trying to get on my own at that age; senior year of college. He’s trying to make it I guess. My dad joined the Navy at 18. I’m worried my brother will get schizophrenia because of a memory I have. People think it’s a false memory, but I know it’s real. I just want him to be happy and successful."

176067694,My dx is bipolar 1 with psychosis. I have had full scale manias and full scale depressions. But I’ve also had psychosis for months without any mood problems. And I’ll also have the lack motivation avolition without any depression. The research facility pdoc said the goal is to treat the symptoms that I’m looking to solve. And using the treatment for that is a bit experimental. Thus it’s good for the research. I’m a guinea pig ??
176067695,Successful gall bladder removal about 4 hours ago! My Doctor told me she was lucky. Inflamed pancreas can be fatal and that she was right on the line.

174359154,"I can still feel physical pain. I have no thoughts at all (or they are hidden away from me) - my mind is completely blank most of the time. I have not had a single thought pop into my head since the time I can remember being schizophrenic. And when the mind is not currently blank, there is only what my schizophrenia produces - voices and inserted thoughts/ideas. I don’t know how my body can even write this without having any thoughts - it’s moving by itself, and I don’t know what controls it. My emotions are gone as well. I no longer enjoy music, or find funny videos funny, or like playing video games as I used to before. Even my stress and anxiety are gone. Instead of old emotions and feelings I now have new feelings produced by my schizophrenia - mostly unpleasant ones."

174359147,"First of all, until I moved to UK to study it looked like a decent country, but now I back to living here it’s horrible and here’s why: Gloomy and depressed atmosphere: my country was a battleground of WW1 and WW 2 and is deep into alcoholism. We are Number 2 of alcohol consumption in Europe per person. Because there are so many alcoholics, most of them you meet during the day is either drunk or pissed off because of hangover. There is also a lot of people not holding a high value of home pets, most dogs are chained, not vaccinated and really aggressive (was attacked on the street with my dog couple of times). Also there are block buildings that are not refurbished and look from 1950’s. We are number 1 according to suicide rates in the world. People lack basic manners: it is rarely that people while squeezing between someone says “excuse me” and you will never almost hear someone at a shop saying “please”. Also as a Barista, a lot of people give me some comments when I miss-pronounce 
any words or my voice sounds flat because of my negatives. People get into rumors too deep: As from growing up, I’ve read and was taught not to spread rumors or not to talk negatively about someone for not experiencing myself. My mom is really into rumors and 60% of her talking is basically what other people i don’t know did are are doing. Also from my experience is that dating for me is difficult as there have been some cases when I go on a first date with a girl and she knows more about me than my good friends, for example: that I am schizophrenic and was hospitalized in a mental ward. So it does increase my paranoia, when someone just started talking knows your past. Stigmatization of mental illness: as mentioned earlier, people tend to gossip a lot and because of that most your neighbors and acquaintances know that you are mentally ill and because of that is much less likely to employ you in your home town. There are plenty of cases of me talking to a girl and when somehow she gets to know that I am i
ll, she decides that we shouldn’t be together. Hence: I am comparing UK, which mental health is much less stigmatized than in Lithuania Low living standarts: Minimum wage here is like 4$ an hour before tax. People rarely get any breaks at their jobs, electronics, food costs more than rich first world countries like UK and Germany. Food quality and variety is also worse than many countries. A lot of people are still using “outside toilets” in towns and cities. There have been some reports on the news that someone’s toilet got broken in a flat so started keeping all the manure inside their balcony or just throwing it outside. Bullying and discrimination: It is really widespread, many overweight, different hair color, different sexuality people get bullied here. As me, partly ginger and being from a countryside was bullied for 10 years until I moved to UK, I was afraid go to canteen, study or just walk around school. I felt self-conscious about my hair color and weight. There are weekly fights in school 
yard that school administration does nothing about it. Students start smoking when they are 12-13 and school and parents still does nothing. I myself was beaten several times and school and was always followed and felt being persecuted. Thank you for your time."

I don’t know if I’m asexual he says I am not but I don’t know. we do plenty of other things and he’s actually interested in going out theatres and movies and eating out … He’s actually interested in getting to know me. And me him."

176067703,There is no point to this illness. It’s a constant loop of struggles. But I am grateful that at least the meds can take away the delusions. Unlike Dementia where there are very little treatments involved. In that sense I am lucky.

I don’t think there is anything wrong with a can do attitude, as if it gave just one person on this forum hope that they can one day reengage, it would be a good thing. We don’t need to focus on the negativity all the time as that would be tiresome. Anything that someone with SZ can accomplish needs celebrating.

176067715,The Health experts have been very helpful. I don’t want to turn this into a political discussion _AT_MENTION_. I want this thread to remain open.
176067716,I got off on chantix/champix whatever it’s called in your neighborhood. It can make some feel sick but it was so easy. If your struggling check in with your regular doctor. It’s not for everyone but I found it worked so easy and I couldn’t give up after trying everything.
176067717,I’m post menopausal. My worst symptoms were hot flashes and night sweats. Not much to do about it. I didn’t take any meds or anything. Just dealt with it. It didn’t last too long.

176067719,_AT_MENTION_ it looks really good. It’s coming along great.
176067720,Metformin did nothing for me but its good for preventing diabetes and that’s why my psychiatrist prescribed it.
176067721,Why did you do that?
176067722,It’s true. Our own mind can be hell or paradise
174359155,If you’re anything like me stress causes positive symptoms to flare up. Work is stressful it would cause positive symptoms. I think it’s ok to be ok and be on disability. I’m in the same boat you’re in. When my review comes up I’m just going to tell them about the effect stress has on me and how I have to avoid it daily to stay healthy.
176067723,"I should not feel so all alone, everybody must grow old. I had an _NAME_ clinician whose clients used to call her Tab, which stands for “temporarily able bodied” She takes the teasing well. She was a good sport and I’d love to see how she’s doing when she’s my age."
176067724,"Not like this, you made me worry,"

Off Sertraline now, and the withdrawal from that is over, so I have stopped the paracetamol Off Aripiprazole, as this was not lowering my prolactin Refused Mitrazapine due to side effects Halved my Procyclidine intake Halved my Diazepam Pregabalin is next. If you have been on Gabapentin, I think this is similar from what _AT_MENTION_ said a while back Any feedback on how vicious this is to come off would be appreciated! Thank you"
176067727,I avoid social interactions at any cost.
176067728,I am in the USA. The financial support system here is cumbersome and often insufficient. I imagine it is much the same for Canada. Do you have a counselor or social worker? You could try talking to your parents. Maybe a counselor or social worker would facilitate that discussion?

Among the atypical antipsychotics, one trial found that aripiprazole may reduce interpersonal problems and impulsivity. Olanzapine, as well as quetiapine, may decrease affective instability, anger, psychotic paranoid symptoms, and anxiety, Of the mood stabilizers studied, valproate semisodium may ameliorate depression, impulsivity, interpersonal problems, and anger.

There are countless realities, in some realities there really are different sized “races”, like hobbits and giants, as in the animal kingdom where there are mice and elephants, salmon and sharks, seals and whales, budgies and ostriches. Why must children start small, wasn’t I born an adult. It seems to me that I had an adult’s mind, if not education, from birth, yet not an adult’s body. In some realities, sexual reproduction does not take place, babies are brought by storks, or appear out of the ether, fully formed.

For example if we do a not needed activity during this time we forget to think about other needed activities and thus spent too much time wasting time on that activity. Like for example sleeping during day, watching movies etc. If we can carry multiple goals in mind at a time we not get stuck in one activity, one thought etc and we can quickly jump from one activity to another. If its depressing thought then we not affected much as we have other thoughts in mind. This is how normal people can remain active."

The authors hypothesized that maternal bacterial infection during pregnancy increases offspring risk of psychotic disorders in adulthood, and that the magnitude of this association varies as a function of severity of infectious exposure and offspring sex.The authors analyzed prospectively collected data from 15,421 pregnancies among women enrolled between 1959 and 1966 at two study sites through the Collaborative Perinatal Project. The sample included 116 offspring with confirmed psychotic disorders. The autho
rs estimated associations between maternal bacterial infection during pregnancy and psychosis risk over the subsequent 40 years, stratified by offspring sex and presence of reported parental mental illness, with adjustment for covariates.Maternal bacterial infection during pregnancy was strongly associated with psychosis in offspring (adjusted odds ratio=1.8, 95% CI=1.2-2.7) and varied by severity of infection and offspring sex. The effect of multisystemic bacterial infection (adjusted odds ratio=2.9, 95% CI=1.3-5.9) was nearly twice that of less severe localized bacterial infection (adjusted odds ratio=1.6, 95% CI=1.1-2.3). Males were significantly more likely than females to develop psychosis after maternal exposure to any bacterial infection during pregnancy.The study findings suggest that maternal bacterial infection during pregnancy is associated with an elevated risk for psychotic disorders in offspring and that the association varies by infection severity and offspring sex. These findings call for addi
tional investigation and, if the findings are replicated, public health and clinical efforts that focus on preventing and managing bacterial infection in pregnant women."

176067845,I think porn has its uses. My gf doesn’t care if I watch it. I don’t watch anything in the realm of crude or disrespectful dehumanizing stuff. I don’t even like to watch people actually have sex in Porn. Mostly just jerkoff instructions so hey if I’m horny let’s get this game over with and on with my day or just a striptease or whatever. Honestly my sex drive can be annoyingly high so it’s one way to get it out of the way. Real sex is great too but too much of it gets old too. Porn can alter your expectations if you watch too much. So best to be moderate about it and try and keep it vanilla?

174359217,"Frankly, I was done here, I was simply going to watch the time tick by until deletion. However; you’ve both raised very good points. I think the “God” option can safely be ruled out too. In fact I rules it out sometime back. A) I roundly rejected the concept on night one expecting all this to end as a result. B) I stated - “Gods do not exist. Only the truly just qualify for the epithet, and the truly just would reject it.” As for your point regarding: That presupposes that you know the mind of “God”. How do you know what a “god” would or wouldn’t do? For example and there are many, many others: If I am an earthly manifestation of a “supreme being”…I may simply be here to “find myself again”. If so, I appear to have totally rejected the entire concept of “myself”…The saga continues…Etc: If I had it all figured out, I indeed wouldn’t be here. I don’t have anything figured out, it all has too many possible options. So I could be said to be here to “reduce th
e options if possible”. That’s what I’m coming to realise. That’s largely where the whole “hit the jackpot”, idea sprang from. Reading the posts here, I can see a lot of suffering, and I’m not suffering anything. I’m loving every minute of it. Well so am I pretty much, but actually having something to answer brought me back. “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!” _NAME_ The Godfather: Part III Ooooo, maybe I’m “_NAME_”…Just kidding. Honestly, it sucks that if we all share the “same condition”, that I’m loving it and you’re not. Perhaps there’s something in my “mental attitude”, either during my first “episode”, or since, that buffers me from the negative affects of the illness. Perhaps I’m “God”. Who knows? Well, quite frankly, nobody knows, or ever can “KNOW”. All anyone can know, and I REALLY want to drive this home well and truly is: “I think, therefore I am.” _PERSON_ Go with the flow…"

176067940,"I have sza bipolar type and PTSD for early childhood sexual abuse. It’s terrifying to live with flashbacks and psychosis at the same time. Never could I be more vulnerable and the pain is unbearable. There’s many times I would have rather taken my own life than to have lived like that. But somehow I made it through some dark times and with therapy and medication I now enjoy a flashback and psychosis free life. Everything changed for me when my abuser died. It felt over, and I was finally able to put it down and start healing. I’ve been flashback and nightmare free for awhile now and with meds I have very little psychosis. If I could say one thing to help other people it would be don’t minimize what you are going through, take it seriously and get yourself as much love and support and help as you can because what you’re going through is real and just because it’s invisible doesn’t mean it’s not there.

176067948,It’s weird because we have our scheduler who is sort of like our manager and is also a nurse. She handles scheduling and RTasks. Which is what we use to essentially divy up the different cares that are needed to be done in an assisted living home. Then theres the building manager and shes also sort of our manager too. Shes not a nurse but she handles resident complaints and anything to do with the building and rent and resident insurance and stuff like that. I think building manager could be considered supervisor. Its confusing cause theres essentially two higher ups that run everything. And that’s building manager and the scheduler.

176067961,You gotta calm down! Suicide and homicide are serious. Very! Just relax I get like that too I can’t handle stress. Perhaps you need something for anxiety which is basically what stress is. Also tel your doctor or therapist how your feeling! Hopefully you feel better soon. It’s no biggie jobs come and go!!!

176067965,Im on a break from it and as its zero hours I dont get sick pay … i do data entry and the pay isn’t great but thats why I do it because irs low stress … i know i could get a higher paid job and do a good job until my mental health cause issues so I don’t do it …i feel annoyed for that too as I feel I’m capable of other things
176067966,"I have good experience with Latuda. What you’re experiencing is anxiety and Latuda is well known to be a cause of anxiety. Of my 5 years of taking it, I felt the feeling of depression every single time I took it; and it increased with dosages. It’s more so an anxiety feeling and that’s why I took it right before bed to combat it. It’s short lived, only a couple of hours at most."
176067967,"It is good news. I guess he is treating the symptoms individually rather than the diagnosis which he didn’t say what it is. As he don’t like labels. But he did say I get severe anxiety and resulting mood swings. He is gonna treat the anxiety. But since he can’t prescribe SSRIs on their own due to risk of mania, he added the mood stabaliser. I am not depressed as he said,"
176067968,yea i can’t read super long texts like that either. My concentration just doesn’t allow me to do it.

176067972,Oh I see. Well thanks for the explanation.
176067973,I can feel happiness and some other emotions now since my meds were changed and that’s great. But I dont feel much in bigger events in my life. Like I got engaged recently and yes I know I’m happy because it was my idea and I love her. But theres some kind of block in feeling it deeply. When I do feel deeply it catches me off guard.
176067974,I think I do well enough without putting myself through that

176067982,yea it’s pretty cool that they can do that with having had psychosis. I hope they manage to get things going when covid isn’t too much of a bummer anymore.

176067989,The craziest action I took when psychotic is to date a girl from another city. It was when I worked in the West. Besides that my inaction and subtle paranoia cost me my job a year later. Probably my life too. +++ Wandering the streets at night and screaming too of course. Had to hide from police least they interrupt my sleep in the streets. Posh Westerners have locks on appartment blocks always so I couldn’t sleep inside the building under someone’s door .

176067994,Yea.I have stopped ap for 5 times.I always got insomnia and get racing thoughts at night
176067995,Lol. I think the reason you went on the injection was you couldn’t be trusted with pills. Now you’re trying to dress it (non compliance) up as something intellectual and make it sound reasonable. Prior to going on meds you were running down the street naked covered in blood screaming about ufos in your head. And now you want to go back to that? You need to be on injections. You can’t be trusted with pills.
176067996,Lets say you or actually I am sitting somewhere as in a coffee shop and having a conversation with someone and the people a couple tables down start making rude comments during their conversation and then it sounds like they making the comments about me but then I refused to get emotionally entangled and they sounds more like quacking ducks than people who are insulting me. So how does one decide if any of that was real or some sort of hallucination? Or does it even matter?
176067997,I hope everything smooths over _AT_MENTION_! It is a tense time now with Corona.

176068029,I was diagnosed Psychosis NOS for a few years until we stopped my meds. My psychiatrist warned me that if I relapse without meds it will be changed to sz. That’s why I think sz and psychosis are similar. After being put on meds the second time diagnosis changed to sz.

174359255,Fair comment on the study (from a dodgy source mind you). But why dont you concentrate on learning coping skills for your schizophrenia - instead of stressing how big your fcking cock is? It comes across as shallow. Some of us are just glad to be well.
176068055,"I’ve gone to doctors outside of county mental health since I was 16 years old. They’ve always thrown me into the mental hospital if they decided I was psychotic even if I wasn’t a danger to myself or anyone else. Supposed delusions alone get me thrown in. Counselors in my area do the same thing to me. So I either lie and don’t go to the hospital, or I tell the truth and never get out. That’s why I go to county mental health - they don’t make me stay at the psych ward. _AT_MENTION_"

Tip: dont speak of philosphy to prove points to the psychiatrist They were like, its been 2 years and the people stalking you dont seem to be real from what you tell me. They stamped me with an insane label and sent me to the psych ward, probably to straighten me out. Im gonna look for a therapist instead of a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist would just up my meds and it was like speaking to a wall."

174359245,"I’m not sure if this is a delusion in my eyes, but in this life, I most identity as a time traveler with schizophrenia. While not being really interested in the show itself, I can relate a lot and perhaps even see a glimpse of myself as _NAME_ the character from the show. I even have past life memories of meeting some of the cast in another life. Is it possible that my life was based off _NAME_, which I really didn’t watch or read much into? I saw the machine in the show and probably was an experimentee some time ago – maybe trillions or more lifetimes ago? I’m guessing people have this technology now. Combined with the letter I wrote in college in a past life, and going to _NAME_ Base, NM in a past life, is it possible I was abducted by aliens and experimented on by the military? Is there a connection? In one of my past lives at university, I remember a “voice” in my head saying “they” (perhaps reptilians from mars) overwrite my consciousness because I posted something on the inter
net. I was targeted for something that I have no clue about. _NAME_ said they might have looking glass technology or quantum access technology to see into the future and pre-identity people before they are born or as an adult for something. Did I go to space? Why me? I have a lot of memories and dreams of stuff that may or may not be real. I’m not joking and I’m serious. I would like help and possibly some support here. I believe they are using my soul (really, consciousness) as a form of time travel and possibly to switch bodies. I would like to know why if these technologies exist, why do I keep reliving my life from unknown time and spacial location as a paranoid schizophrenic forever and forever? It seems like I’m in a time loop or causal loop (open or closed?) meaning I probably lived this exact life over and over again millions or billions of times. Two things that really interest me are: Why isn’t the government acknowledging this or giving people money that have been experimented or that have 
been tormented by this? More disability money would be nice. I’m not in the military or the Illuminati. And am I in the same exact time line or a different time line? (This question is super important to me). If we live in a computer simulation, does that mean many world’s interpretation is wrong and was never right to begin with? Was it all a lie? I would post this on Facebook, but my name is attached to it. While, I have no reputation or friends, and possibly little future, I rather post this “delusion” here because I think I’d get more support here. I put “last post” here because I don’t know if we have freedom of speech here anymore because most of the time I talk about my “delusions” I get called “delusional” or have “disturbed past lives” or am accused of encouraging my own delusions. In the past, it was better, but my memory isn’t the greatest. Nostalgia? To me and others, aliens are very real. I don’t know how admin or the mods feel about this. But it’s very real to m
e and others. Am I the problem or do you guys need to be more open minded about certain things here? _NAME_, from Travelers: Travelers Wiki _NAME_ (Traveler 004 and Traveler 5069), played by guest star _NAME_, was one of the first travelers. He was responsible for setting up the traveler communication infrastructure. His host body manifested Schizophrenia, leading to him being sent... Sometimes, I think I was targeted because I was the first or one of the first to realize we live in a computer simulation. I went insane in college my first life and ended up at _NAME_ Base in New Mexico. I posted that I time traveled from pot and smoked an unknown substance. I was told I was picked because I was potentially a gifted person (psychic?) and because of unknown ‘alien’ genetics. Was it because I posted that I was _NAME_ or something or they thought I was? Thank you and have a nice day."

176068064,Need to tell these things to your treatment team. It’s not really a place to encourage illegal behavior as you can appreciate but reliase you need some help and asking. I’d recommend talking to your doc asap. We all take meds and we all react differently but we all have different problems. I guess you need to address your impulsiveness first.

176068066,"I grew since birth in a 11/2-2pack a day smoking Grama and mom household. _PERSON_ didn’t smoke so they had a pantry with door in the kitchen cause he couldn’t make his 14 year old and 36 year old wife smoke outside in WI. He’d hold infant me by a fan to blow smoke away in a whole other area of th _NAME_ house. When mom turned 18 and I was 4 we moved into an apartment and she still was a 2 packer, pregnant with my mid dr le sister. The daddy of sister was a low rung drug dealer, so I know mom was clean, he left coke residue around, and would beat my 4 year old butt for sweeping it with a broom off of the counters. After he was gone, 4 years later he knocked my mom up again, got my youngest from that. Mom stopped smoking during that pregnancy, went from 120lbs to 250lbs when she gave birth. She was quit until about 1994 when she met _NAME_…9 years of that back to 2 packs. They lasted 9 years, I’ve explained other posts what all happened with that aftermath. I started smoking in 1997, but I 
was a half stick every few days. Basically puff a couple, toss it. I made a pack last a month. I quit in 2001 when _NAME_ asked me to cause that little bit triggered his asthma, even though I never smoked anywhere near him. Just the smell on my clothes. I only was that little bit but I had to do the hard candy to suck on to break it. My saving candy was them _PERSON_’s Temptations caramel chocolate and creme savers hard candies. Haven’t been made since 2001. I’m the only one of my mom and sisters, and stepdad that don’t smoke. They are all now 2-3packs a day, they have the machines they roll their own. But holy ????, my middle sisters kids are age 10-8mos, the oldest 4 can roll cigarettes. That’s 10-4 years old. _PERSON_ lives with a father of 2 of the 5 kids in our hometown. I won’t go to her house because of all the weed and cigarette smoke. My kids are severe asthmatics, and _NAME_ is too. A whiff of her walking by can cause a fit. So those that have quit, good for you! Your health, others heal
th, all that. Those that need help, contact your health departments because US has a program they will pay for 3 attempts to quit be it Chantix (wouldn’t recommend though for sz), lozenges, gum, patches. There’s one other one I can’t think of but the program will tell you the options. Each state has a program, so look into it."
176068067,I just want to scream.
176068068,"Here’s my take: #1 . Seems to be more fear motivated. One time when I was supposed to go to group therapy I went outside to get in the car and I just stood there for 5 minutes, then I went back in my apartment. When I explained this to the therapist he said it was fear. #2 . Seems to me to be the same as #1 . #3 . In my experience, when 1st admitted to hospital I was pretty heavily medicated and/or meds changed. That can cause the symptoms you mentioned. Might be a good idea to ask the pdoc or therapist(if you have one). Nutcase"

176068074,Best of luck to you. I’m glad you’re going to see a doctor
176068075,"I say skip the quiz. If you don’t let yourself relax when you’re already feeling overworked, you’ll end up feeling burnt out. Your brain will work slower and things will feel exhausting more quickly. You’ve got a 98, so chances are your next tests will yield a high score too. I don’t know how many points you need to pass, but I’m sure you’ve got some wiggle room. Let yourself have some time off so you can feel refreshed."
176068076,"I think it is worth the risk as long as if I relapse, I can get stable again on at most 5mg abilify, but that’s the thing I can’t guarantee that. Just because I got stable on 5mg one time doesn’t guarantee it will happen again."
174359257,"You’ll need a good med to feel more grounded. Have you tried Clozapine? If it works and doesn’t mess with your white blood cell count, it’s usually great."

176068078,So much for “Final”??
174359265,I haven’t shaken my delusions yet. I still believe the government gave me schizophrenia and I can semi prove it. They don’t bother me much anymore though and I am functional and stable. It can get better.

176068083,"You have to remember that there are many more symptoms to schizoid PD than social isolation. When you ask them, many will say that the social isolation itself is not a problem and that they both enjoy and prefer being alone.

176068086,I am not sure what to do recently. I think i am lead to make unnecessary connections and feel somewhat alienated from certain friends. I went on here for help but one of the two cyberstalkers have tried to hurt me again. Its a pity bc i avoid this persons post and try to enjoy this forum but they started something weird. I was lead to overthink something out of nothing. Should i take a break from this forum? Also how do i get over feeling a disconnect from my friends? I feel like my roommate turned some of them against me by using psychogically insulting remarks.
176068087,_AT_MENTION_ it was the thread about achieving things in day to day life.
176068088,Oh my god that’s so ??????? triggering. From real life medical professionals. They should have their licenses revoked
176068089,"I’m glad to hear that! Mood swings are the bane of my existence right now, but perhaps they will ease up with time."
174359254,It’s funny you say that because apparently people with a history of an auto immune disease are at more risk of schizophrenia I believe.
176068090,"_AT_MENTION_ my older brother, _NAME_ lived in the basement and was like a grumpy old man from the day he was born. One day we were fighting over the channels. I like hockey, he liked football. When I changed the channel, he grabbed me on both sides of my head, picked me up and slammed my head into the door jamb, dropping me to the floor. The moral of the story, is careful what you wish for LOL My brother and I get along fine now, by the way. Let bygones be bygones…"
176068091,"I would say it’s about a 3 / 10 It can get better, but usually I surprise myself how well I am doing when it’s required for something like work, it just takes so much effort it’s tiresome and I give up with it all."
176068092,"yeah maybe, but i was pretty sure last night that cutting my wrist was the right thing to do… it would have made me realize my family loves me though. i had a brief feeling of my mothers love when i realized how close i got… it was my ego that pulled me through though… but yeah you’re right too, because i guess i believe right now that my ego is a necessary evil… albeit a temporary one"
176068093,Stress usually makes me pretty sick. I don’t think worry does that much.
176068094,"_AT_MENTION_-Cotton, we’ve already discussed this. You need to tell your dr. Plain and simple. Multiple users here have already told you that. This is an example of you talking in circles."
176068095,"Well, well, well, my _NAME_"
176068096,"I’m having thoughts of cutting my parents out of my life. They haven’t done anything, but I’m suffering and I’m not mentally healthy. I hate having to drag them down into the darkness with me. They are both ignorant of my symptoms and don’t seem to want to accept that I’m sick. Something happened with my brother at my birthday party, but I won’t go into that because everyone has already told me to limit my time with him, which I did, he just wanted to be there on my birthday. Either way, I can’t have parents and I don’t feel like I’ve ever had a sibling. I hate feeling like this."
176068097,I think it is quite interesting to see what drives a person and what there interests are. I understand though if you are in a part of your life where that is just not possible. I have been there myself when I was younger.
176068098,"Don’t they have coupons if you have no insurance and are poor? I have issues with medi-cal because they don’t like paying for brand names. Luckily, I have my dad’s insurance, but if he passes away someday, I’m S.O.L. I will have to change meds back to Risperdal or something. I don’t think I can afford private insurance. I can barely pay for ???? anyways. After rent and food, I live off of $200 a month and most of that goes to food and soda."

176068101,"<3 I dont remember. But i observed when my mother convinced herself that she was ok and then she stopped taking the pills, but the thing that brought her back enough to get her to accept she had a mental illness was possibly weed. some people i dont recommend everyone go out and smoke weed, some people it causes their illness. Everyone is diferent. So think of it like that. If everyone is different, than not all meds will work for everyone. Have a nice day."
176068102,"I think I dress ugly and down. I go for comfort and I have poor man’s clothes. I tend to wear the same clothes everyday, and not shower anymore. I tend to wear a jacket when it’s hot outside because it’s comfy and my security blanket and I don’t like the cold air touching my skin. Maybe people think I’m weird because of that but they can’t really tell unless they are very close to me or see me every day. Most people I come in contact with are the people at the stores and I don’t know them at all."
176068103,"It feels impossible trying to find a psychiatrist in my area, but I definitely am going to tell them about it. I have a feeling it’s my anxiety/OCD acting up (especially since it only happens when I’m feeling anxious about schizophrenia) but I’ll definitely keep my guard up. Thanks!"
176068104,That is what I was thinking too. To my best knowledge there are no other depots in the partial agonists so I think his advice might not be accurate
176068105,Mostly from myself.
176068106,It’s OK guys I spelt the word freak wrong. I corrected it. That’s what _AT_MENTION_ was referring to.
176068107,welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_
174359262,It took me 6 years to figure it out for myself and I got sick at 38. Lots of people say I can’t possibly have it getting sick at that age but now I know I definitely have it.
174359272,Sounds like a brave thing to do. _PERSON_

176068111,You should follow the treatment plan set forth by your doctor or medical team. If that includes antipsychotics then take as directed.
176068112,Hey _AT_MENTION_ that’s a cool name ! Welcome to the forum
176068113,I actually think I am. Sometimes only when we take things to their extreme can we see the fallacy of the logic
176068114,Magnifique!!! I wish I had your talent
176068115,Mostly how to make music.
176068116,_AT_MENTION_ let me know what you get cause I think I want to quit using clonazepam too. All sleep aids I have read about so far from drugs.com have some kind of med interaction
176068117,"I was walking down the street seeing the “robotic faces” who were mind readers/aliens and signs of pyramids in common architectures, while psychotic.

176068118,Nope no way. It was awful in there.
174359277,"I’ve been lucky with EPS. Last appointment I had my pdoc put me on procyclidine as he’d noticed I had a tremor. I’d not noticed myself , except when I pick up a mug to drink from it. I’d say it’s a mild tremor at worst."

176068125,"When I am coming off an anti psychotic I get really, really angry. Don’t get alarmed. I’m not the violent type, at least not physical violence, but I commit emotional violence off the scale."
176068126,What word are you talking about _AT_MENTION_
176068127,"Inhaling anything into your lungs is harmful, but I suppose it’s “safer” than smoking regular cigs or something."
176068128,Do you think I wasn’t truly delusional?
176068129,Time is going really slowly for me today too. Usually time goes good for me lately but not today. Today it’s slow for me and I am not feeling super.my breathing feels difficult. But because of emotions. Hope you will get good medication and feel better.
176068130,"This is a great example of how my brain processes information when I’m tanking mentally. Two nights ago the TV Show Wheel of Fortune was on. The puzzle answer was… Award Winning Screen Writer My brain broke that down into… A Ward Winning Screen Writer As in, I was the winning screen writer from the (Mental or Psyche) Ward. My ‘delusions of reference’ thought that Wheel of Fortune was talking about me…and my ‘delusions of persecution’ made me feel i was being mocked or slighted with those play on words. I know…I know…it really is bananas, but in the moment it is all real and exhausting for me to digest, as I do that type of thinking with most everything when psychotic."
176068131,"Whenever I am talking to myself in my mind or reading something in my mind, almost 90% of people can hear it clearly. It is happening to almost everywhere I go. I am suffering from this problem since last 2 years. I have visited good psychiatrist but she gave me tablets for hallucination and I took it for 4 months but it didn’t work at all. Now I’m not taking any medicine. Please let me know a solution for this problem. Thanks."
176068132,Curious…
176068133,I don’t feel sick. It’s just that damn cough.
176068134,Never mind. Maybe I’m mistaken.
176068135,"Nice one thank you, every bit of support helps and I appreciate it"
174359283,"That’s what the doctor said. That I’d get it anyway. Probably true. But I would do anything, pay anything to change my life and delay the schizophrenia. I get schizophrenia from drugs. In a past life, parallel universe I got it in high school. I suffered so much. I was denied the meds and everything. My mom and even scientologists…in a past life. I used to be immune to schizophrenia but they ended up giving it to me. The aliens and possibly others. The insectoid aliens changed my destiny to get schizophrenia in college rather than high school. When I got it in high school, it was from marijuana and other stuff. I had it bad. Probably killed myself. I have before. It is controversial. I’m definitely not suicidal anymore. I might suffer from quantum immortality or something. Had billions or more lives. I was popular in high school in a past life. I didn’t smoke marijuana in high school out of fear and intuition. I was getting dreams I was an investment banker in a past life a long time ago. 
I think it was real. Doesn’t happen anymore. Getting flagged by people with no spine. God Bless you this morning and have a nice life. All this is real and your small minds cant handle the truth."
176068136,"Let me ask you a question, where is the resound and final proof that pot or cbd is safe and cures anything other that political will to tax the stuffing out of the wealthy? It the product they turned into poor peoples tax. It cures only weak willed political will to abandon the corporations and the profiteering in elections. There are like 15 or so ways to decriminalize and not turn a profit on addictions people have, but instead we are only provided a dichotomous argument of imprisonment for use, or a great feast on the consuming public that consume. Fake arguments."
176068137,Can a hot feeling in your forehead mean an allergic reaction?
176068138,"The blood may be because you irritated your rectum by wiping too hard or too much or maybe the stools were so hard that they scraped the rectum skin. This is just my opinion formed in the past when I was constipated and there were blood in my stool that went away after I got over the constipation. (hey ladies, wouldn’t you date me? Believe me, this is my main topic of conversation when I take dates to dinner). Anyways, Magnesium citrate works great for me but one time I drank a bottle and a few minutes later I vomited it all back up because I had drank a lot of fluids and eaten too much food prior. It works great though, very reliable.(Yeah, seriously ladies I bet I sound irresistible now. You’d love, a nice, romantic midnight stroll at the beach with me comparing notes on the benefit’s of stool softeners). But seriously, it’s possible to get dependent on laxatives and that could really be serious. Some laxatives have a warning to not take other laxatives while using theirs. Suppositories w

176068148,"Hard to pin down. I think my best thought was on a walk I was having, during my more stable period. I was mulling over the nature of life and living, then I contemplated the “spark of life”, that first impulse which resulted in life as we know it on Earth. Then what happened was just barely comprehending the countless different choices and influences that lead to that spark, from the very beginning outward. It was like touching God, I felt like I was comprehending infinity, and I couldn’t stop sobbing thinking about it as I was walking. Took a good few minutes to snap out of it. I’m not the crying type, that deep moment really stuck with me though."

He’s keeping an eye on me because I’ve been on them for over 20 years and he said that the risk of TD, be it from typicals or atypicals, is cumulative over time. He was telling me about 2 new drugs (Ingrezza and one other) that have been released lately and has had a lot of success in the elderly in long-term care where it was most studied (and the cases of TD were much more severe). So don’t worry too terribly much. At least now we’ve finally got some meds to treat TD, which is huge."

The first was to examine whether chewing gum improved learning and memory of information in a story. The second aim was to determine whether chewing gum improved test performance on a validated intellectual task (the _NAME_ task). A third aim was to determine whether chewing gum improved performance on short memory tasks (immediate and delayed recall of a list of words, delayed recognition memory, retrieval from semantic memory, and a working memory task). The final aim was to determine whether chewing gum improved mood (alertness, calm and hedonic tone).A cross-over design was used with gum and no-gum se
ssions being on consecutive weeks. In each week, volunteers attended for two sessions, two days apart. The first session assessed mood, immediate recall of information from a story and performance on short memory tasks. The second session assessed mood, delayed recall of information from a story and performance of an intelligence test (the _NAME_ test).There were no significant effects of chewing gum on any aspect of recall of the story. Chewing gum improved the accuracy of performing the _NAME_ test which confirms the benefits of gum on test performance seen in an earlier study. Chewing gum had no significant effect on the short memory tasks. Chewing gum increased alertness at the end of the test session in both parts of the study. This effect was in the region of a 10% increase and was highly significant (P < 0.001).The results of this study showed that chewing gum increases alertness. In contrast, no significant effects of chewing gum were observed in the memory tasks. Intellectual performance was improved 
in the gum condition. Overall, the results suggest further research on the alerting effects of chewing gum and possible improved test performance in these situations. Intellectual performance and alertness improved with gum. It doesn’t say if the gum was sugar free or not. Might have to start doing it more often. It doesn’t say what the mood outcome was. O wait the alertness was part of the mood ."
174359284,"I’m having recurring nightmares of the job I had around 10 years ago. I had a schizophrenic break all of those years ago, partly thanks to how people there traumatized me mentally and emotionally. A lot of them said nasty, slanderous things about me behind my back, for starters. Sometimes to my face. Many of them strangers, some from my high school and college (I was bullied my whole life). Some of them coworkers. I never want to be at that hellhole ever again. The scary thing is some people from my old job are infiltrating my neighborhood, masquerading as other people. The new receptionist at my psychiatrist’s office looks and sounds like a woman I worked with, with a different name, and she once worked for a three letter agency. I’m afraid they’re not finished in trying to ruin what’s left of my life."

176068294,"But you seem fine, I mean, you sound stable."
176068295,The last few days and I’m always getting paranoid that the tin I’m putting my cigarette butts in is on fire. I check all the time. Feeling super paranoid about it.
176068296,o great thats good you didnt get any side effect hopefully you dont get anything either on the second dose.
176068297,I’ve been farting at least once a day for years. Haha good thread chordy
176068298,The trouble with medication is that it may help but it hinders in the form of annoying side effects
176068299,Oh good! Pull that trouble making tooth.

176068301,My past psychotic experiences have been very mild.
176068302,it’s funny you say that because when I had vitamin d deficiency it took forever to correct. They kept giving me 50000 iu of vit d every week for months and months it took over a year to finally correct the deficiency. I don’t know if that’s normal or bad vitamins.

176068316,I use speech to text to put text messages together it helps me not forget what I am saying quickly. but with speech to text I can still _USER_ID_ or delete things too. It the conversations that leave me drawing a blank the most
176068317,What are they going to charge them with? Being psychotic ? Impossible to bring a case against them I suspect so it would be a waste of time I think.
176068318,Is he used to be like that ?
176068319,Yeah it gave me a really rough time. I’m glad I’m off but I still have side effects. I’m so cognitively impaired.

176068325,"anybody ever say 'thanks for coming, it was nice to meet you?"
174359322,"Now this slightly concerns me. My four year old nephew has this habit of twirling his hair and pulling it out in some spots. Because he did this, they shaved his head so that the bald spots would not be noticeable and also in the hopes that he grows out of the habit. It is the second time they’ve had to give him a shaved haircut. I really worry that he doesn’t develop a mental illness as it is hereditary and seemingly has affected our family. I do not want him to have to experience life with a mental illness. He does have some behaviors that might indicate a behavioral health problem. Most of all, I hope he manages to have a “normal” childhood. Did anyone experience a psychiatric treatment in their childhood? Or if anyone else wants to add anything, please feel free to share."

174359326,"I was in 7,5 mg of aripiprazole since June 2018 and around to 5 months ago I decreased to 5 mg. I don’t have the called positive and negative symptoms anymore. I heard some people saying (even my first doctor) that aripiprazole is not so good for positive symptoms."

176068333,"Had one therapist tell me that I should come off of meds, was so high functioning I couldn’t possibly be SZ. That was a fun relapse."
176068334,"thanks man. i really appreciate your confidence in me. i was pretty easy to get along with in my 20’s. a little too care free as i didn’t worry about anything school or work included. but then i got in a dark spell and withdrew from everybody. now it’s just my circumstances, in that i live in the country and i don’t see anybody anymore. they all live in the city and have family, i have one friend in town but he works 55 hours a week so doesn’t have much time. maybe it’s not too late to make some more friends."
176068335,Thank you. I figure it’s a last hooray. Good for you for eating better. I hope it helps honey.
176068336,I was diagnosed _PERSON_ around the age of 39. I had already established my job…family…and friends-set. So I can’t honestly say I’ve ever faced _USER_ID_ or any sort of discrimination. None of my peers changed when they found out about my affliction.
176068337,"Dont fast. It shrinks your stomach and then once you start eating again it begins to expand back. Just start eating less, but more. That way your stomach will always be the same size. Also supplements help with weight loss. I personally recommend EGCg (Green Tea Extract) I was able to quit smoking with it and I eat 3 times a day now (before I ate only once) Some days are cheat days though."

176068339,When you started meds did it actually prevent or reduce any of your symptoms?
176068340,"I had a dream that I was at this table with my mother. It was like a long scientific table with gadgets all over it. We were playing some sort of game with some random people, I don’t remember who. The game was odd. I remember it had to do with collecting items like little trinkets and cards like valentines day cards. I especially loved the valentines day cards. My mom seemed to think they were worthless, but I would always open them and read them whenever I would get one in the game. She would get a little impatient but she would catch herself and say “no that’s ok, It’s just ‘Leaf’, she can have it” But the game was like poker in a way too. So money was falling on the ground and I climbed under the table to collect it. I realized some went under the floor so I went on the other side of the wall and under the floor to get the money that had fallen. Where I found, in the dirt and grime, rolls of coins, plus loose change and as I kept digging I found these little bags. When I unzipped 
one of the bags I found out it was an emergency blanket. I started to come unfolded before I could stop it. I couldn’t fit it back into the little bag. I brought it to my mother to fold and put back into the bag and she folded but because her arthritis had gotten so bad she couldn’t get it back into the tiny bag. Just then my ex ex’s brother (Uncle _NAME_) happened by and my mother asked him to put the blanket back into the tiny bag. _NAME_ said “oh boy, those are hard to get in there once you take them out”. Then we talked awhile about how this isn’t the first time I took one out. I fell for it once before when curiosity got the best of me and the same thing happened and I never did get the blanket back into the bag. That’s it. That’s when I woke up. Weird right?"

I wasn’t functional at all when I stopped my meds and before taking meds.

174359344,You’re delusional but at least you’re not violent. I was lucky that Risperdal worked for my positive symptoms as I was homicidal/violent off meds and on non working meds like Zyprexa and on Latuda or on lower doses of other meds.
176068358,"I dont know if i can and should ever still be 100% off meds…my doc does still hope so, even after multiple episodes, but i doubt it. I also dont want to bash medication…i just think it is important to know some people can be more sensitive to all sorts of symptoms, even psychosis, after lowering medication. The first week(s) or so i was always much more of a mess, until things settle down somewhat. So this should be done carefully, under the watchful eye of others, and never cold turkey. Even people with no psychiatric history can get issues after withdrawal of an AP. I have seen this in someone prescribed an AP for nausea. It isnt really scientifically known afaik how long it takes for the brain to reverse this."

Unfortunately I let it get the better of me still, and these people have probably long moved on by now. I am pleased about this for you, and hope it continues to be a decent support. The problem I have is the only competent physician I have is my pdoc, and I only have very limited access to him 6 weeks to 12 weeks apart. It’s incredibly frustrating.

I spent 3 hours outside yesterday and got sunburn pretty good in that time. My parents were with me and they didn’t get sunburn anywhere near as bad.

Strong perfume is so awful, I was stuck next to a woman on the plane wearing some and had almost a full on migraine by the time we got let off. I have only smelled BO on a woman back in elementary school, there was someone who made a habit of not bathing. It was pretty mild though, nothing strong or disruptive. I was told I stunk in a mental hospital once, probably the truth as I was neglecting to shower regularly. I would shower first and if you can’t you can always cancel if you’re worried about it. It feels awful to be called out for smelling bad. I use Speed Stick deodorant baby powder scent and apply it twice a day. But hey, everybody who dances is gonna sweat, right?"

174359355,"Pseudodementia is a condition where mental cognition can be temporarily decreased. The term pseudodementia is applied to the range of functional psychiatric conditions such as depression, schizophrenia and hysteria that may mimic organic dementia, but are essentially reversible on treatment. Pseudodementia typically involves three cognitive components: memory issues, deficits in executive functioning, and deficits in speech and language. Specific cognitive symptoms might include trouble recalling words or remembering things in general, decreased attentional control and concentration, difficulty completing tasks or making decisions, decreased speed and fluency of speech, and impaired processing speed. People with pseudodementia are typically very distressed about the cognitive impairment they experience. With in this condition, there are two specific treatments that have been found to be effective for the treatment of depression, and these treatments may also be beneficial in the treatment of pseudo
dementia. Cognitive behavioral therapy involves exploring and changing thought patterns and behaviors in order to improve one’s mood. Interpersonal therapy focuses on the exploration of an individual’s relationships and identifying any ways in which they may be contributing to feelings of depression."

I had read some novel, one character which is I will refer as “victim” the victim got manipulate by one character I will call “Mr._PERSON_” Victim haven been in abusive relationship for like…the whole life? So Mr._PERSON_ take the chance to do some impressive act to victim trick him(Victim) into his(Mr._PERSON_) planned, in his hands, in his game V
ictim who think he receive freedom and had his own free will he clinging to the concept of his own free will, but in reality being used by Mr._PERSON_ So I start wonder, Do we really have a free will? maybe freedom and free will, is it just a words to call some concept that all humans made up? is there really “freedom” ? well, I just kinda struggle with dissociation since I was little so many things don’t seem real to me, my bad, my bad, lol. and actually when I talk about something like this people just think I’m insane(oh maybe they’re right) But I like your question"

I heard high alkalized water could disrupt digestion… Also Does kagen water use distilled water? How does it work?

176068443,I’ve been on 10 mgs Zyprexa since 1997. I take it at night before I go to bed. When I was working I had a hard time waking up so I tried taking it in the morning for a week. It made me want to fall a sleep standing up. So I take it at night. I’ve gotten use to it over the years. I use coffee to fight the sedation and to wake me up faster in the morning. When I first got out of the hospital in 1997 they had me drugged with haldol. I couldn’t get out of bed I was so drugged. I found a doctor and he prescribed Zyprexa. I quit taking it and had a relapse. It took about 5 years to recover from that psychosis on Zyprexa. It was a slow recover but I decided if I was going to dedicate to meds the rest of my life it would have to be at a dose of something I could tolerate. I tried other meds but always went back to Zyprexa. When trying other meds I could feel psychosis coming on. On a side not Zyprexa is stored in your fat cells. When I had a relapse it took 30 days before I had a psychotic break. The 
doctor told me the drug was built up in my system. Thats why it took 30 day. The longest I’ve gone without taking it since is 4 days when I was in the hospital for a bleeding issue. Just so you know you can skip a dose here or there without much effect because it’s built up in your system. Myself I have a difficult time sleeping without it. I still have a lot of problems from schiz like psychological issues but the hallucinations and delusions have subsided over time. The only time I get hallucinations and delusions is when I’m stressed. I still have paranoia and fear of going places alone. I get anxiety just walking out the door.
176068444,Great now I found info on cloning consciousness online. So I believe in the cloning again.

I was already mostly wheelchair bound when we met. And I was unmedicated cPTSD with psychotic depression fresh out of several abusive relationships. I was a hot mess. I don’t have any friends.

I am stricken many many times by intrusive thoughts of wanting to die over miniscule things. I don’t understand it. The next day I am exhausted and sleep half the day away. Even once I wake up I feel like a zombie. Completely foggy brained and cannot focus on anything. I’ve been getting migraines every day. I’ve been trying to study for several days now and can barely make it through a single chapter thats how bad I’ve been. I feel like absolute crap. I don’t know what is wrong with me.

176068483,"I’m addicted to junk food. The idea of “food addiction” is relatively new but gaining traction and support as studies are now showing that junk food can cause our brains to react the same way as it would to addictive drugs. I cannot control myself when it comes to junk food. If I go to a fast food place I am unable to pick a healthy option. If I drive by a fast food place on my way home from somewhere and im hungry I will almost always stop and get it. I have cravings for junk food that are very strong. I have tried to quit junk food many many times and have been unsuccessful and each failure leaves me ashamed and disheartened. I’m coming up with a new plan to change my diet that involves acknowledging and tackling my food addiction. I need to become aware of triggers that lead to me eating bad things and learn alternate coping methods or if I can avoid them then do that. I cannot have “cheat” days where I can have junk food. Not even special occasions. The same way getting drunk on the
ir birthday could trigger a relapse for an alcoholic even if they’ve been clean for years, doing something like having cake and ice cream on my birthday can send me on an eating spiral where I will start eating like absolute crap again and gain back all the weight i lost after having been “clean” for however long. (I am not even exaggerating, this happened to me recently with my birthday where I’d been eating great and had lost weight and then decided to cheat for my birthday and eat how I wanted and then it spiraled from there) I have a pathological relationship with food. I am doing my best to work on it. Im going to take things slow and make changes one step at a time until I have a healthy diet. My initial goal for changing my diet was to get back to a healthy weight. But I think I need to make it my main goal to have a healthy diet first. The weight can come later."

I also rarely brushed my teeth, did laundry or took care of my appearance, didn’t talk to much of anyone, didn’t know where I was going in life. I was super negative all the time.

174359368,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov In schizophrenia, psychomotor retardation is associated with executive and memory impairments, negative and psychotic symptoms, neurotoxic immune products and lower natural IgM to malondialdehyde. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and AF _PERSON_, The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, Feb 2020 07 Objectives: Stable-phase schizophrenia comprises two distinct entities namely Major Neuro-Cognitive Psychosis (MNP) and simple NP (SNP), which are defined by neuroimmune and neurocognitive abnormalities.Methods: This study investigates associations of psychomotor retardation (PMR), clinical and biomarker characteristics of schizophrenia. We recruited 40 healthy controls and 79 schizophrenia patients and measured IgA responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), IgM to malondialdehyde and nitroso (NO)-cysteinyl, CCL-11, an immune activation index based on cytokine levels, and motor screening task (MOT) sc
ores.Results: PMR differentiated schizophrenia from controls and MNP from SNP. In addition, PMR was strongly associated with impairments in executive functions and episodic and semantic memory, psychotic, hostility, excitation, mannerism and negative (PHEMN) symptoms. Around 50% of the variance in PMR was predicted by the cumulative effects of the immune activation index, CCL-11, TRYCATs, NO-Cysteinyl and natural IgM. PRM can reliably be combined with PHEMN symptoms, memory and executive impairments into one latent vector reflecting overall severity of schizophrenia.Conclusions: PMR is a key psychopathological feature of schizophrenia mainly MNP. In addition, PMR may be driven by deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system and increased production of neurotoxic immune products, namely TRYCATs, IgM to NO-cysteinyl, and CCL-11, an endogenous cognition deteriorating chemokine."

174359382,Life is too beautiful to let it pass by. I’m a social schizophrenic. I love to connect to people if I’m relatively sane and on meds. I love catching up with people. Talking is good for schizophrenics. It makes you think outside yourself and it forces you to reply sensibly and in real time. It’s not easy and some struggle I agree and understand but you can always improve. I do really well but that is after a lifetime of trying. I’ve tried and failed so many times it’s just nuts but every now and then you hit some marks and that stays with you. You live and you learn and one good interaction makes it all so worthwhile. Don’t give up. Try harder.

174359387,I still have delusions even on meds 11 years later but then I also did have a delusional disorder diagnosis before schizophrenia so they are pretty prominent. I stopped my meds in 2012 and I made it 5 days and was in an emergency room hallucinating out of my brain. I didn’t hallucinate until I stopped taking my meds. I was taking 20 mg of Geodon once a day when I stopped my meds. Now I take 80 mg of Geodon twice a day plus 40 mg of Latuda. I don’t recommend stopping but I had to learn the hard way too.

174359388,"I’ve watched every episode on Netflix. I started watching it as a teenager in high school I think. I started re-watching it again towards the end of my college education. I then started watching the rest of the show in 2016. I periodically watch trailers, and clips of Lost and the characters on YouTube. I’m obsessed with _NAME_, The Man in Black (aka Smoke Monster), _NAME_, Christian, and _NAME_. I’m not really a fan of _PERSON_, _NAME_, or _NAME_. And I’m definitely not a fan or even like _NAME_!!! Sometimes, I think I’m in hell because of the show. I think it’s the best TV show ever and I have a delusion that either I helped come up with some of the ideas or I had a connection to the show somehow – maybe in past lives or parallel universes. I’ve been trying to solve the meaning of the TV show Lost. What does it all mean? Are there hidden messages? Is there any relation to our reality or the physics of the show? Thoughts? In a past life, I was an atheist, and I felt like (maybe it
s a delusion) that I created my own religion called ‘Lost’, which is the highest order of blasphemy out there. My family is very, very religious. In a past life, they were trying to convert me into being a Christian…and I was very angry or something. I just couldn’t believe it. Maybe they were right. Maybe I was most definitely wrong about everything. Maybe it was the end of the world or something…I can’t remember. Anyways, I think and feel I’m cursed for eternity. I’m not trying to trigger people. I’m bored and I feel like sharing my story and thoughts. Basically, common sense wise, I must be _PERSON_ lol. I’m overweight, I’m a protector, and I’m a paranoid schizophrenic. In a past life, some random guy on Reddit told me I was _PERSON_. I was the biggest Lost fan out there. Even met some of the actors and had photos and stuff in these past lives in parallel universes. I feel like I’ve been different characters on the show like _NAME_, Man in Black, _NAME_, and even _NAME_. Though 
I’ve been told I’ve been _PERSON_, _NAME_, _NAME_, and even _NAME_. Obviously, I’ve never been on the island, but I sometimes think the island is a metaphor for earth, the solar system, a parallel universe, or another dimension. Obviously, things don’t line up exactly or make sense. Like how can one make the Earth move or make it invisible or whatnot? I also believe stuff about aliens…and that I’ve actually been to hell AND purgatory many, many times. I also believe I live in a computer program. Like I said, this stuff doesn’t even make sense to me. But some stuff does. I never figured out what the heck the computer was that was saving the world, and I never figured out what the ‘Dharma Initiative’ was or even the ‘Others’. I have theories or guesses, but they are very, very, very stupid and ignorant! Here are some thoughts I have about Lost: My name used to be _NAME_ in a past life. My brother’s name is _NAME_ in this life. I’m pretty sure I’ve changed bodies before/ transferred c
onsciousness. I used to be immortal. I do age like everyone else, but I also think I’m in a time loop that starts in my early 20s and goes on forever. I’ve been cloned and age regressed also. It might be possible to halt aging but I have practically little to no memories on this and it’s a curse. I’ve died many times I have been cursed for eternity! I won the Lotto in a past life. I don’t play at all. I don’t believe in it. I played those numbers in the Lotto before probably out of boredom, which probably got me cursed or something… I had a delusion I was Spanish in a past life. I tried to be a doctor several times in my past lives. Maybe I was a few times. Not interested anymore. My wife died of skin cancer in a past life. Met the actor that played _NAME_ before in a super market in a parallel universe. He said I was him. I was schizophrenic at the time and he seemed to be teleporting or something. I felt like it was the end of the world or something…again…like always. I had a delusion in a 
past life that I was made of nanobots or some weird ???? like the Man in Black. In past lives, I’ve time traveled. Been told many times, I dated or liked the wrong girl. ( Been to something like room 23 a few times. Hated it. PTSD? (Am I/ Was I _NAME_?) (MK-Ultra?) Had some delusions in a past life like I was _NAME_ or _NAME_ (even though I’m not and hate these guys in the show because they’re evil!). Had a delusion my friend was _NAME_. The funny thing is he never ages in my view. He always looks the same. He is Spanish and I’m Italian. In a past life, he said I should be the smoke monster because the smoke monster is _NAME_. Had a delusion in a past life, my step-father was _NAME_ or the Man in Black (I guess we all switched roles or something and things are convoluted, mixed up, and don’t make sense to anyone else except me). Is _NAME_ a computer simulator/alien/vampire/reptilian/Jesus-like figure or even the devil? Knew a professor who gave me the clothes _NAME_ and _PERSON_ wore in the show. I 
was supposed to get the light clothes and I’m not sure but he may have given me the darker ones…can’t remember…past life. They put me in a computer simulation / inception before. It was hell. Seen the DHARMA food in the super market in a past life. Some kind of ‘Lost’ theme or something going on. Had memorabilia from the show like the game and the wine bottle (past life). Me and my brother talked about it just like in the show sort of. … I could go one, but I guess I sound very, very schizophrenic or sick to the average person. I don’t want to bore you anymore. I’m just a bored guy who likes thinking about his past and trying to connect the puzzle pieces, dots, or whatever. Thank you for your time. And with regards to the MiB, I think it’s because of simulation theory. They don’t want us knowing we live in a simulation, which is probably why I’m stuck on planet earth or stuck somewhere in this simulation. They won’t let me out or leave. I want to leave this simulation and have my sch
izophrenia cured. Thanks you again."

174359416,"I’m curious to hear from others who have schizophrenia. Does talking to yourself worsen delusions and other symptoms? I sometimes find myself having full conversations with myself and it is sometimes hard to stop. Maybe this is a bad habit, not really sure. It might be a sign of the “split mind.” What are your experiences? What have your therapists recommended?"
176068619,Good luck with the med change I hope this is the med for you.
176068620,should i tell doctor about or not ? how i tell him idk if i am convinced with these ideas or not
176068621,What I hear from my older siblings is that my parents used to fight a lot early in their marriage. I think my dad was too weak minded to separate from my mom and also I now think he had a fear of being alone again as he was a single child and his parents had both passed. I think my dad eventually gave in to my mothers demands and never has challenged her authority since. Sometimes I really think I would have been better off if my parents would have divorced. I also think that really ultimately both my parents had mental issues and they started antidepressants when they first hit the market. They have yet to get off the meds and I think it is highly unlikely they will. It became clear to me when I became a teen that I lacked a strong father figure in my life and my mother couldn’t take the place of my dad so she gave up on me and my younger brother and just would send us to hospitals and juvenile court systems…
176068622,"I’ve had really bad experiences with group homes, personally — my advice is that as long as you can still function then stay out of group homes"
174359412,"As _AT_MENTION_ replied before, it is good that you have so much insight! Like yourself, I had some very unpleasant times with schizophrenia."
176068623,I always have really high anxiety after leaving the hospital as my stays are normally really long and I sort of get used to doing nothing and being in a safe environment. What normally helps me is going shopping with friends and treating myself to food that I really like and just chilling at home till I feel more ok with the outside world. Give yourself a nice bath or something lol. You just went through something bad! Treat yourself!

I would be happy just taking showers doing more chores, not being in constant anxiety and fear, not feeling stunned, being able to socialize without faking it, and being a fun mom/person again. I guess being well is settling at a level that may be well for me but not on a normal healthy person level."

176068652,"My brother’s dog died and I was trying to cry or feel any sort of sadness and it was then that I knew depression medicines were a give and take. That there were downsides to them. I really wanted to empathize with my brother and feel a profound sadness with him I loved that dog and there her limp body was in his arms and I couldn’t muster up a tear. I eventually forced myself to cry just through sheer muscle memory, she deserved to be mourned properly. Now the depression medicine is losing some of its effectiveness and I’m having bouts of sadness but I can cry again and its cathartic. I’m not frequently thinking about death and mortality which is why I got on the medicine in the first place, so I feel that I’m not going to bother changing it until that problem comes back."

Then I spent the next two 1/2 years being unemployed and being hospitalized or in group homes. I became employed again in 1983 when I was 22 and I’ve been working steadily, albeit, mostly part time, ever since and I’m 60 now. All I know is it took a _NAME_ help, a _NAME_ luck and a _NAME_ hard work."
174359422,"I totally agree, and agree that surely they can get frustrated at times too… but i swear i have been nothing but polite and respectful towards her since we met. My strategy for handling today’s visit is to try to explain why she’s actually doing more harm (in a very calm polite way lol). When I started having psychotic episodes in the beginning, it was HORRIFYING as I’m sure you all remember. It was even scarier having to be hospitalized because I couldn’t make it stop. My original pdocs kept saying it was PTSD, and gave me breathing techniques, journaling, and antidepressants. I was hallucinating and would literally shiver with fear or experience catatonia, and they told me for YEARS I pretty much just needed to get over it! Funny sidenote, last night I was telling my husband about my experience with Haldol when I was in hospital the second time. It gave me such horrible Tardive Dyskinesia that I couldn’t get my face to ‘unscrunch’ LOL, long hilarious story… When I got my SZ diag
nosis, it was like a giant weight got lifted from my shoulders… I started reading about it on my own, and with therapy better targeted, I got a LOT better!!! It’s because I could finally talk MYSELF down sometimes (not always, but some is better than none!) knowing that my hallucinations were really happening. Not because they themselves were real, but because I am schizophrenic. I didnt get that feeling anymore that my previous pdocs always gave me, feeling like I must be incredibly weak-willed if all the other PTSD patients were getting better and I was the only one getting worse, etc."

176068705,So you eyes have cones and rods that are sensitive to colour and light. This forms a picture. Your optic nerve is made up of specialised nerve cells that “know” how to transmit the images from the eyes to the occipital lobe of the brain. Messages transmit from one nerve to another via neurotransmitters.
176068706,No I was only a danger to myself. I would cut my arm. I did have voice of _PERSON_ telling me to kill my husband but I was stronger than the voice and told him to leave me alone because I love my husband. But he (_PERSON_) tormented me saying I’m a murderer. Once long time ago I was in kitchen with long knife in my hand laughing in front of my mother. She said it wasn’t funny. I never threatened her only myself.
176068707,I assume you’re older then 50.

I’m sorry but that’s my thought. I think if I wasent young and I was on disability therapist would treat me like that to. It’s very unprofessional to say your problems doesn’t matter.

176068710,"IDK, are you degenerating or just going through a rough patch? Are you functioning worse in every way or just certain things? The decision hinges on your own special, individual mental state. Also to consider is that doctors are not always right. But is she right? Are you getting worse and worse? Do you know _AT_MENTION_ on here? When he was hospitalized 20 or 30 years ago the doctors gave him a grim prognosis. He was told he would never work again, that he would never get married and have children, that he would never have a life. Well, he proved them wrong and has all those things, and more. Personally, I had several hospitalizations in the early eighties. But I got out of one and 9 months later I got a job in 1983. I stayed out of the hospital until 1988. Then I relapsed (partially due to a crack addiction I suspect). I went through my relapse for a year but then made a good comeback and got employed again, entered college, eventually got a car. I stayed out of the hospital from 1990-2015. Then 
a series of events put me back in a psyche ward at age 54. I had lost a lot. My mother had died which made me suicidal. I also lost my housing, had to quit college and take 2 months off of work. This is what I really want to say. After the psyche ward I moved into a temporary group home. I had been living in society for 20 years, living on my own, taking care of myself, taking care of business. Then I was back where I started, almost literally. When I was in this temporary group home, it was 2015 and it was in the same city, and just three blocks from the group home I was in 1980! But in 2015 I thought my life was over. I felt I couldn’t function. I thought I would be put in some back ward in some hospital for the rest of my life. I could not see any way I could survive anymore. Well, the epilouge is that I was wrong. I had fallen for sure. I had to move back into a board & care home with 25-30 people. I had to share a tiny room with a veteran who had been homeless for 8 months. But I got used to it. And ab
out 14 months later I moved into where I am now. I share an apartment with one other guy. We are independant except for a counselor who visits us every three weeks. I’ve been back at my job since 2016. I have my car. So I just gave you my story to show how low you can go. Or how low you can feel, but still have things turn around for the better. Yeah, life looked pretty bad in 2015. For your specific situation, have you considered a board & care home (group home)? It would probably be better than the state hospital if you find the right one. It might be a better alternative. Some of them are safe, clean, enviroments, with plenty of freedom and some structure. I would want to avoid the hospital as much as you and if you have a case manager I would contact him/her to see all your viable options."

174359441,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Body mass index, residual psychotic symptoms, and inflammation associated with brain volume reduction in older patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, International journal of geriatric psychiatry, Mar 2020 03 Obesity, aging, and pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) may collectively contribute to the gray matter loss in brain regions of SCZ. We attempted to examine the association between volumes of specific brain regions, body mass index (BMI), inflammatory markers, and clinical features in older SCZ patients.Clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) aged ?50?years were recruited to undergo whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging. We measured patients' plasma levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2R), IL-1?, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Clinical data were obtained from medical records and interviewing patients along with their reliable others.There 
were 32 patients with mean age 58.8?years in this study. Multivariate regression analysis found only higher BMI significantly associated with lower volume of total gray matter, bilateral orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortexes, and the right hippocampal and frontal cortexes. Increased intensity of residual symptoms (higher Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores) were related to lower volumes of frontal lobe, prefrontal cortex, insula, hippocampus, left hemisphere _USER_ID_ and total white matter. The lower volume of left the anterior cingulum was associated with older age and higher sIL-2R plasma level; and higher IL-1Ra level was associated with greater right anterior cingulate volume. Older age at illness onset was significantly associated with the smaller right insula volume.Higher BMI, more residual symptoms, and inflammatory activity in IL-2 and IL-1 systems may play a role in gray matter loss in various brain regions of schizophrenia across the life span.

Are medications just not for me? I’ve been on nearly everything excluding vraylar and clozapine… I admit I occasionally do miss my morning medications, maybe a few times a month. Could missing these doses be sabotaging my whole situation? I’m kind of afraid to bring up much with my psychiatrist because they might change something and I feel defeated and dont want anymore change or anything else added. My friend can some how immediately tell if I’m acting aloof and gets upset with me instantly for it. They can tell just by the tone of my voice some how… Its bizarre. And I’

To tell you the truth I didn’t really give it a second thought even though I’ve seen the article 6 or 7 times today. But just a couple of minutes ago the article came up but I realized that I had only been seeing the top of the title. The full title is “Queen Considered Stripping _NAME_ of Title”, lol.

176068849,"I had a doctors appointment today and afterward I went to the cafeteria at the hospital across the street. I’ve been there once or twice but I got lost so I was wandering around asking people which way to go. Most of them were friendly. I thought I found it so I tried to go in the automatic glass doors but they were the doors to get out. I happen to glance inside and some young woman was signaling me trying to get my attention. She pointed out the right doors to get in and when I got in I was in the wrong place again so that woman looked friendly and I walked over to ask her if she knew where the cafeteria was. And man, she was a knockout! About 30 years old wearing a dress. I think she was half-black and it made her look exotic. But yeah, she was explaining the directions (which I wasn’t understanding) and she had a huge smile and we got a little rapport going. And the way she was sitting I see she had great legs. So we’re getting married the first week of June. I’m just kidding—it will 
be the second week. No, no, no. that was just in my head. But she seemed really nice and after she made sure I finally understood I smiled and left. Today was just one of those days where I felt pretty good and people seemed so friendly and helpful."

I don’t really know how to describe it so that it can totally let you be able to imagine it.

176068866,I went on a lot of LSD binges in the year leading up to my illness and took some pretty high doses and once on a really high dose of 4 tabs I felt really wired and was super attentive to any sensory input I was getting. I was like laser focused on the sound I was hearing and I think it messed something up in my auditory processing because now when I hear a lot of background noise my brain focuses on it and I hear the voices louder like they are being interpreted from the background noise. I didn’t have voices when I was doing acid but I started a few days after this high dose of LSD. I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that the hallucinogens triggered or caused my sz. Did anyone else feel like this happened or used LSD leading up to their illness?

It is a Flourless Orange Cake with Orange Syrup. You brush the syrup on the outside of the cake, kind of like i did with the lemon cake. So who prefers what cake?"
176068870,"Hey , is there anyone who’s not on treatment and doing okay or who’s on some alternative treatment. I heard about this consummo herbs stuff and I’m wondering about others experiences on alternative treatment. Have you tried something else or have you found a way to manage symptoms without ap’s? Thx!"

176068874,"Paranoia causes my voices. Medication doesn’t touch them- oh yeah they could be worse. I do too things i learned from the bible. Take them captive- put them in jail and sniffing being rude to them, partly… Both may sound pretty strange but they work for me. gift from god"

With my AP, it’s in the background of my mind, but I can push it aside and go on about life and can question those beliefs. But it’s always there to some degree. I used to be so fundamentalist Christian I even covered my head with veils etc. I feel like without meds it takes over me."

176068885,Institutionalised racism is pretty much ingrained in many populations. I’m so called white too but I’m not proud of anything my ancestors did. It isn’t me per se but the process of conquering and such still happened and it’s still the treatment of others today which is the problem. We are all as guilty if we allow such things to occur in our societies and I for one am not proud of how our culture/civilisation treats others of different race.

176068891,"I’m a psychologist, and my second psychiatrist told me I would never be able to work in my field. It would cause or arouse or exacerbate my delusions. He had told me that something simple, without effort or responsibilities would suit me. Well, I am not sure about that. But if I was a psychiatrist, hearing others’ crazy delusions would arouse mine. I’m sure about it"

176068892,My best present was a truck. It was a 01 tundra TRD limited edition. I had that truck and got a second engine put in it and had it to 340000 miles. Man I loved that truck it was a beast. To bad I got rear ended and my truck got totaled about a year and a half ago.
174359487,I once had the Australian spy organization keeping tabs on me with microtransmitters attached to birds. With meds I learned that such things are extremely common for something like schizophrenia. It’s like that Dire Straits song. Two people think their Jesus. One of them must be wrong! All’s I’m saying is trust your treatment team. It does get better. Medications changed my life profoundly. No more fear. More rational thought. It’s a win/win.

174359488,"good, interesting thread. shows we’re all different. Abilify and Geodon for me. Abilify created a catatonic state- tried to escape the mhospital twice while switching meds. Geodon was the worst. Physical aberrations, all sorts of unspeakable pain. Tried Seroquel, was a good ap, stopped having pot cravings and kept me disciplined. The back spasms and body ache were unbearable however. Olanzapine lifer."

176068898,i’m not sure how many delusions i have/had… it’s hard to say what is a delusion and what not. I know they called some things that happened to me delusions but they still feel really real to me.

176068902,yea i think if i wouldn’t have had my parents i would have been one of those people on the streets. It’s my parents who send me to my gp doc and she send me to the psych ward first time… and then after that i got a pdoc and then things finally got a bit better… but without my gp doc and my parents i would have been far worse off for sure.
176068903,LS! I supplement with 400 microgram of lithium daily. Lithium blocks the gene GSK3. Maybe it makes you live longer.

176068905,My other neighbour whos Bi-polar always says shes high. Its not hard to tell when shes on one cos she talks very fast - and numerous parcels turn up for her when shes gone on a spending spree. Tbh i prefer to be Sz - its sounds way worse. You can tell when shes on a low - cos she wont be seen for days.

I still ended up psychotic in mental hospital lol"

176068924,"Yes, my hypomania episodes on meds last so short. I’d be dancing and singing and super happy for an hour or two then crash again On the less extreme side, when I have a good day with avolition not so bad, I would use that time to do things that I can’t do when my motivation gone (my motivation low most of the time). But unfortunately those good days don’t last for long It seems like joy is so elusive… I’ll have to settle for contentment rather."

174359494,"Hey everybody, I’m new to this forum and was hoping to get some advice on how to deal with being on antipsychotics. I have heard that inVega is a relatively mild medication but I am dealing with many of the typical mental and emotional side effects of being on antipsychotics. Can anyone tell me if it gets better? I’m on my third month of being on inVega. I’m hoping my dopamine and serotonin receptors adapt to the inVega so I can feel more normal, because I’m constantly distracted and demotivated. I have always dealt with schizoaffective symptoms as a result of doing drugs, and only very rarely have mild thought broadcasting which I can quickly disregard if my brain chemistry is “at its base” free of drugs and meds. I have a lot of anxiety that I may not need this medication but will wind up dependent on it once my brain adjusts. Anyone with experience on this topic… I’d greatly appreciate some anecdotal experiences, reassurance, or feedback… thank you!"
176068927,Aw thanks for that compliment I love it hehe!!
176068928,Yes but for example many schizophrenics I see in real life have severe negative and cognitive symptoms and look like zombies. I believe normies see that they are not well.

174359500,Talk with him. Get a pair of headphones for him so only he can hear the stuff. TV noise is basically nails on a chalkboard to a schizophrenic.

176068937,"It may be nasty, but unfortunately it’s true more often than you’d believe. I speak from experience. And those experiences of abuse many times by many people makes the world look like a bleak and dangerous and sick place. And that trauma is really hard to overcome. It scares victims and survivors for life"

176068939,"Yes i can relate, very rare, but sometimes i forgot what i wanted to say, i ring someone and forgot why i called, cause i was 30 min. on hold. I had a second of a lack of attention and forgot my bag at the busstop. Car accidents happen cause the the driver lost one second of attention and drives over a red light."
176068940,That’s scary. I believe this little boy is a hallucination and you need to talk to your Pdoc. I’m sorry you are not well.

176068949,"And what would _PERSON_’s approximate age be, if I may inquire? The earlier you start, the harder it is to ditch a bad habit later in life. Vaping might be less dangerous than smoking but it’s still addictive. It comes at a price in both money and health. I picked up smoking at 30. Lately I was able to cut back, from 15 to 8 a day. Still can’t quit. Damages gums, lungs, skin. Bad breath. Lowers self esteem etc."
176068950,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_
176068951,like you are doing something wrong. Or rather that everything that you are doing is wrong and that everyone is upset with you? I feel like everyone is mad at me for something and I don’t know why. I just want to sit here and mind my own business but it seems like the world is mad at me for it. Do you ever get that feeling?

176068959,"I used to have this unusual belief that I’ll call disorder physics. When I was behaving unusually I would have this idea that I was catalyzing social behavior and I guess that I was the only thinking individual and my actions set everything else on motion in kind of orbits that radiated away from me. The thing was when my behavior was odd this perception would be verified by others reactions and i would see myself affecting the environment around me. I would sense that my power was growing and this would result in a mass gravitation event where police, security guards, nurses would pile on, masses would form as crowds to watch. It was a very plausible delusion in my state. This perception stayed with me for years and it was though a type of physics reasoning I considered my social alienation or sometimes activity. I thought like this even when not psychotic. I still wonder about the physics of thought and action and find it hard to forget the things I observed in my altered state."

176068962,"Well, where I’m from, most mental health professionals only judge you by the stereotypical symptoms. And those are mostly found in males. Like poor communication skills or an outright lack of desire for social interactions, odd fixations like being unusually fascinated by trains, skilled at maths, etc."
174359519,It took 95% of my life. All I can enjoy now is food. I can’t even enjoy video games. But I keep having hopes for new meds. False hope is better than no hope.
176068963,"I’ve known her since I was 21 years old, so 32 years. We are very close. She’s an incredible woman. She’s in her 70’s and still works as a therapist for some of her long time clients that she has very close relationships with and didn’t end when she retired. I had to update her on the situation with my daughter and she was of course sad to hear. She is worried about my grandbabies and about me. She gave lots of great advice and support. And she’s sending money for my son in law. I’m so glad I have her in my life."

176068965,Getting a 502 bad gateway error message with my pubmed rss feeds . I hope this is sorted soon .
176068966,"For two years after diagnosis I just took the pills and we basically ignored it, but I was in a bad way due to side effects. Once I started actually trying to understand more did things become a problem. I gained 35 kilos on Olanzapine as I have mentioned many times here, and I was determined not to get diabetes, so I have been fighting to be on meds that don’t make me put on more weight."
176068967,"One thing that works for me… I have trouble interacting with others on the fly. The good thing is that different people tend to phone about the same problems over and over. I’ve gamed most of the worst ones out ahead of time. I’ve got a binder to one side with stuff broken down step-by-step. I can refer to it to get back on track if someone flusters me on the phone. You know you’re going to hit some rough patches, and that’s okay. Plan ahead for it and have a course of action ready. What most people call luck is actually advance planning and preparedness. If you can do this then you’re ahead of 95% of the population."

176068980,"There are some useful ideas in his work, but a huge pile of rubbish too. Ever since i spoke to a Freudian therapist from the USA i became less enthusiastic. I called to inquire if he could help and what the practicalities were, he initiated/pushed a conversation about ???????? that i didnt ask for and in the end of the talk said “oh btw i charge 350 dollars for this call”. Maybe that is normal in the USA, but here it is a ridiculous and insane bill, you could get like 5 full hour sessions for it, and they would never charge before actually agreeing on treatment and price. I also dont much appreciate what they say _PERSON_ did: purposefully cover up his discovery of parental sexual abuse as a major cause of his patients trouble. Because the powerful perpetrators could help him get money and status and his patients couldnt. He twisted it so that the kids were the problem, the ones who initiated sick behaviour even. So. If that is true, i do not like _PERSON_."

Another guy who took another drug wasn’t able to sleep for a week. I get psychotic, aggressive and a danger to my surrounding and myself when I smoke weed. I switched from smoking weed, shisha, cigars and cigarettes to vaping 40mg nicotine salts. Its been a year and I will never smoke again because both my grandfathers died of lung cancer in their 50s and my 37 y.o uncle died from pancreatic cancer. Drs said its because of smoking."
176068983,Your doctor should be able to prescribe something. Maybe even plain old niacin (vitamin b3) could be prescribed.

176068988,My best friend growing up turned out to be lesbian. At first I was critical of her choice but then I accepted it and now I’m not judgmental anymore. Everyone has a choice.

176068991,"I’m really uncomfortable and going a lot. _PERSON_. I may have to call a friend to take me to the ER tonight if it gets worse. I hate to do that though, they have a baby and have their hands full. Maybe I could call my ex daughter in law. idk who to call. Maybe the neighbor would take me."
176068992,"i did not stopped my meds because i was never on meds regularly. the last time i took was on 26/5 , 0.5 mg risperidone , for one day, and the time before is on early Feb , maybe 0.5 mg risperidone two days consecutively , and the time before should be Oct 2019 , maybe 1mg risperidone , for one day, and the patterns justc repeats , but there is no weigh losing like now during all these time so imo it is not really related to the meds but my physical health condition."
176068993,You have also to consider that you are from northern europe.
176068994,I feel like I have a bit of an unfair advantage from being born with it. Seeing/hearing things that aren’t there has always been part of my life. Luckily the other types of hallucinations aren’t as constant for me. And it took a long time but I feel like ive found some balance. It took a lot of discipline time and luck to get to where I am but I made it I’m hopeful through time you will find balance as well!! I’m sorry your hallucinations are so intense.

174359517,"There’s nothing you can do about your ex husband nagging you, He’s the father of your children and you’ll always have to deal with this personality. You can, however, keep doing a good job and not worry about if dss gets called. You said the kids are clean, well fed and that your place looks pretty good, In that case, I wouldn’t worry. The worst that can happen is he calls dss and they come, find out your an awesome mom and the whole thing is dropped."
176068998,"I owe you guys an apology. I’m not using this forum on a healthy level. In fact, I’m just continuously exploding on here. I’m basically acting like a shi*ty person and just a manipulator. I’m not trying to make people to feel sorry for me. I’m not trying to make people to offer me emotional support. That is not my intention. The reason why I say bad things to myself is because I truly believe what I am saying. I truly believe that I’m just a jerk, and I don’t deserve anything. If I voice that to my parents, my parents yell at me to shut up, and end up yelling at me about how worthless I am for thinking this way. I haven’t been able to see my therapist for weeks because the plans get cancelled or my brother needs a ride to his work. So, I’m stuck. My friends are all in another country. I’m at home all day, either on the computer or doing embroidery. I don’t have any means of going out because the bus stop is 30 minutes away from my home. I’ll work on controlling these impulse
s of outrage against myself. And if I just keep getting angry at myself due to triggers, I’ll leave the forum for days to cool off. This is not healthy on any level, and this is not healthy for the forum. I’m starting to believe that I don’t deserve to be here, and I’m just ruining the forum because I’m either complaining about my rare disease, about my life, about my country, or about loneliness. This isn’t healthy. I’m very sorry for anyone I’ve offended, or anyone I’ve angered. I’m sorry if I come across as manipulating or deceiving. That is not my intention. Again, I would like to offer my apologies to anyone who was offended by my words. I’m truly sorry."

Added bonus of ultrasound is that they can turn the screen towards you so you can watch the image as they do it. You can even have another person in there with you. I assume they’ll find nothing. If that’s the case, spend the MRI money on a therapist to help you move past this."

174359523,I voted yes. A schizophrenic can aim high and succeed indeed. But not for me. My symptoms are as they are. I get overwhelmed by things like someone scraped their keys on my car and I can’t talk to insurance because I don’t understand their jargon so family has to do it for me. I can’t work in aged care cause I’m socially awkward and my body twitches uncomfortably sometimes when I try to work it’s so I can’t stand it it feels so awful. I am realistic and understanding with my self. I am on the pension. I am bad at driving and can only drive to easy places. I do a little volunteer work but do t know if I can continue because of the power crazed pregnant woman and the man who makes me wait so my body twitches while I’m waiting and I don’t want to be made waiting like that when it makes me feel so bad. Many schizophrenics have succeeded but it’s different for the individuals and success can be taking a shower and going for a walk for someone… I aim little realistic goals I think. I d
on’t aim to high because I tried my best and couldn’t do it. My mum thinks I don’t aim high enough and she thinks I can do things I can’t do but she also denies I have schizophrenia. I live doing pretty simple activities and like it that way. I do have goals but they are not aimed so high. I even believe I can find n have a partner and friends. I have certificate three in aged care but can’t work with it unfortunately. I really wanted to but I couldn’t do it. I have no academic goals now. Possibly a short simple cheap course online without real grades just to learn a bit in my own pace.

174359542,"0-10 years old was good for me. I had complications at my birth but those years were good to me. Then at around my 11tg birthday I was taking a piss in a urinal when my “friend” at the time looked down and says “omg you have a small penis” and then he was like “do you have a small penis?” And I was like “yeah” because I had no idea whether small or big or anything was bad and I was completely uncorrupted at that point. And just in shock. Then he goes and tells everyone in camp from my school also that my penis was small. Well This kid _NAME_ says “you’re never gonna get married, you’re never gonna have sex” and I went home that night and I researched and found out I was like average size and I didn’t even start puberty. But like it doesn’t matter. But I had an inflated/deflated sense of myself. And then I pretended to be a different person on the internet then myself. And it was schizoaffective and it was all caused by this one incident. _NAME_ and _NAME_ bullying me at 
11 years old was the reason for sza, ptsd, drug/alcohol addiction maybe. Well _NAME_ passed away this past week or 2 and it’s brought up some uncomfortable feelings. My therapist is really supportive but she was like “did it ever occur to him…he’s never gonna get married himself”. Now that he’s dead, and it just brought uncomfortable thoughts. I know she means well but it’s a tough situation. But what really set me off is the idea of a feeling of separation ever since THAT MOMENT.before that I was popular good with girls. Athletic cool good in school. And then I just felt different from everybody. I’m sick of feeling this way. People don’t understand me. I tell my therapist I put on a mask/fake identity to cover up my insecurities/traumas and it drives people away/gives them unrealistic expectations of me. I told her I don’t feel I could ever have a relationship. And it was a heavy session. And she asked what I would say to my eleven year old self and I said nothing could’ve saved me fro
m this trauma. And a lot of things. And ???? life sometimes. Like I understand we may get high expectations and they don’t get fulfilled and that’s part of life but when there’s constant abuse. And emdr reminded me of it all."

176069102,"I’m celebrating with my husband and kids. My daughter comes home from college in a couple of hours (Yay!), and we will be decorating the tree once everyone gets back. We’re late decorating, but we’ll leave it up until the 5th, right before my birthday. I have some of the cutest pillows for my couch; I’ll have to share pics once I have everything up. We’ll exchange gifts and have a good time. I’m really looking forward to it. My daughter coming home gives me some extra energy. For dinner, I’m doing prime rib, green bean casserole, glazed carrots, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, rolls, and cranberry sauce. We are going to do jalapeno poppers and loaded potatoes for lunch, especially since my youngest won’t eat the prime rib. She doesn’t really like red meat, mostly just pork."
176069103,Just take a breath and reread the rules I posted for you. Then follow them. The main rule is to be respectful of others.
176069104,I so rarely miss. I just need to get some stuff done.
176069105,So i wonder if it’s normal to see gruesome things. Like blood and raw meat in hulsantions. Mine tend to be gross such as blood and raw meat. As well as maguts and people faces melting. My vioces are bad as well. They are very harmful and say mean things to me. Has anyone else had these deductive hulsantions?
176069106,Than you so much _AT_MENTION_
174359551,Ill have to change my psychiatrist and maybe it doesnt work for positive symptoms like Zyprexa. It a stronger AP than Abilify and Latuda so more negative sympyoms than these. I am really stuck in my bed.
176069107,Congratulations!!! What did you learned?
176069108,Today my thoughts were a little different than yesterday. Yesterday was a little frightening and unnerving more scary than today. But I didn’t like some of my thoughts today. I am usually outgoing and cheerful when I am out. Today tried to block people reading my mind.
176069109,My sleep is messed up at the best of times. Sometimes I sleep all day and sometimes I only fall asleep by 4 am.

176069124,"One member here had a purple marker (purple was her favorite color) and would use it to draw the slashes on her skin instead of cutting. She said it helped because then she could see after all the damage she avoided causing herself, plus she got to see her favorite color which was calming."
174359554,I think having a regimen would help me too.
176069125,Is that because you stopped your Zyprexa? Tell your psychiatrist that you stopped Zyprexa.
176069126,"Just got off the call with my psychiatrist and I’m feeling pretty good about it. We decided to switch meds because of increased prolactin and it being hard to lose weight, plus some prediabetic symptoms. He at first wanted to switch to geodon, but he ultimately left it up to us to decide, so we decided to go with lumateperone. I’ve been watching this closely before it was even approved, and I’m glad I’m now able to give it a shot. I just hope it goes better than what happened on Vraylar."

174359566,"Today’s visions were less intrusive, thankfully. There’s the vision of my old best friend, saying “I have mastered schizophrenia causing and being annoying.” That’s like hearing an adult bragging about tying his own shoes. He is one of a few evil people, who really have learned how to cause visions. I have that problem, and regular schizophrenia, too. Today also had the visions of my dad, saying that he would have not installed schizophrenia here, but “didn’t think that it would be that bad.” He never took the time to look up how badly it can destroy life. My dad said that he thought that schizophrenia was “neat”, because it can cause Tardive Dyskinesia. It’s like talking to the devil. I talked to the police and figured a few things out. Visions can be caused on purpose, but there’s also the part that mimics people. Schizophrenia is obviously an attack which required training. Voices have similar, evil personalities, like they are inferior and trained to say negative things. 
It is possible that evil spirits, magic, and stupidity are the true cause of schizophrenia. The most stupid develop a “control freak” desire to pointlessly control other people’s choices. Studies show that drug use increases the risk of schizophrenia. That tells me that the dumbest 5% of people wanted teen age drug users to be tortured with that disease. The visions that I see are not caused by my mind. They can be caused by evil spirits in the mind, and also evil pranks of others. I’ve had to hear part of the song “greased lightning” twenty times today, and someone else is choosing to make that happen. Perhaps and evil spirit moved into my mind to haunt me, but the mind isn’t designed to do that by itself."

176069137,"I don’t want to find myself suffering like that way again… If possible So I try to Co operate with my professional psychiatric team. And do my own research where and when possible. I think cooperation that word is so important, it is so important for me to be able to have my say with them and then hear them out and come to a mutual agreement with my psychiatric team."
176069138,"I am sad about this now… I see how I function in the relationships with the others… Mostly with my mom . Now I understand her to be honest… You know, that I still have my body sensations, caused by fear and pressure, they are painful, but they make me act weird… I sometimes even tell to my mom, that I cant listen to her problems… That’s terrible… I can avoid or hide and am not even help for providing my food, my mom still does this for me, while she is old and tired… I really live with the hope now, that I will change, I fight for it in my way. But meanwhile, I remain often cold and psychopathic, I see this now … I went through hell tbh, even my doc was saying, that my illness is more painful than the common one, but I guess I caused a lot of pain to my mom … My sister is another story… She also blamed me that I was insensible when my father was beating them, but I wasn’t it inside of me… Me too I wanted to stop this terror, this violence… Its just that I went sick very 
early and i was just with my pain… For god sake, i lived in isolation for 20 years folks! … My sister is not right, they also should have saw that my behavior is not normal and its a pain too… But nope, i remained undiagnosed till my 25s and for all this time, since kid, i was in hell, always alone, rejected by friends, partners and everybody… But anyway… Idk if you also felt cold and how you lived this? Maybe its only me, idk… Its not good to feel guilty about it i guess, but it’ll take me still some time to change it…Its sad though… Take care"

176069145,"Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about. It’s like people don’t want to have anything to do with others. They’d rather post things on facebook instead of having a quick word with someone face to face even when they know who they should adress. Yet somehow people were able to give each others messages before internet"
174359559,Did it cause mental or cognitive issues? I was thinking about a low dose like 100mg. What dose were you on?
176069146,I havent asked him
176069147,"That’s depends how far into psychosis I am. Odd thoughts when I’m semi baseline I can usually just talk to someone I care about, double check that they don’t really hate me, and that it’s just in my head Farther down the rabbit hole I stop trusting people, and at that point only medication helps until it passes"
176069148,It affects some people in a sedative way and others in stimulating way apparently!!

I have negative symptoms for over 16 years now and at first it was just little but progressed progressively as each year go by. So waiting for it to go away is of no use instead learn to live with it in spite of these. This doesn’t mean you can do nothing regarding it. You can do several to make sure it not affect your day to day living. It include habits, schedules etc stick to it at all cost."

174359577,"PubMed Central (PMC) Dietary patterns and schizophrenia: a comparison with healthy controls It has been reported that the onset of schizophrenia and the physical complications after its onset are related to diet. Diet has been considered as a variable factor of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, the results of studies on this... Rice, bread, and confectioneries, was labeled the “cereal” dietary pattern. green leafy vegetables, lettuce, cabbage, mushrooms, and fruit, was labeled the “vegetable” dietary pattern. Therefore, we hypothesized that a dietary pattern consuming a large quantity of vegetables would be associated with a lower risk of schizophrenia morbidities. I eat a fair amount of both of these dietary trends. I do like broccoli, asparagus, and spinach. If I was paid a good amount of money to eat 75% of my diet in vegetables I probably couldn’t do it."

It wasn’t a classic car that we showed off in, it was our family car because it was the only car we could find that we could afford."

176069227,Just a reminder to those of you who are in fall and entering that time of the year where there’s less sun. The darkness can depress some people. Jacket up and spend time outside! Wake up early to get enough sunlight. Sun helps you stay cheery. I watched the sunrise this morning and it was refreshing. Hoping to run outside later when it warms up.
176069228,"Not existing would suck IMO. Those NDE accounts are my number one sense of comfort with this illness. I like the thought of a possibility of something after, a place where I’m not sick and I get to be with my cat and my granddad again. That would be well worth waiting for, and I wouldn’t be scared to go in the end. I’ve seen stories where some NDE experiencers completely change their outlook on life afterwards. Like you said it’s about 80% positive experiences, which is a comforting statistic. I think you should aspire to live as long as possible, _PERSON_. You’re a great person and your family is gonna love having you around. My Grandfather was in his 70s when he passed, if he had lived ten more years it would have made us all so happy."

176069254,"Hi. I just wanted to find out, have you had any kind of testing done to determine the cause of your headaches, head pressure and brain fog? I am also experiencing this. I am planning to go and see a GP about it though, and hopefully they can guide me in the right direction as far resolving it. I did bring it up with my pdoc. He recons it is from tension, and that medication should make it go away. But I personally suspect there might something more to it on a physical level, and I should get it checked out. So have you had any sort of testing done in that regard, and were you given any advice?"

Basing his self-worth on a static concept of intelligence will only give him trouble later in life. He needs to understand that it’s more fluid than he thinks right now, and that how hard he works is more important than how smart he is. Also, don’t start rewarding him physically for doing well, like I see has been suggested. The motivation needs to be internal. Physical rewards tend to often make an internal motivation external."

She said because of my drinking (I have cut back quite a lot) she will only give me two weeks of my meds. I’m moving next week. I’ll need to find new insurance, new doctor…when i told her i will quit drinking to get my meds she rolled her eyes and shook her head and said she didnt believe me. she made me cry as she has many times during sessions. she really is awful, mean, and doesn’t try to help me at all. I will run out of my meds. I called the office expressing my concern because last time i was off my meds i tried to kill myself. All they told me was they could give me two more weeks of meds. I don’t think I’ll find a new insurance and doctor by the time my meds run out. I’m so scared to be without my meds.

176069286,"The funny thing is calculus isn’t really that advanced in hindsight. I think proving math is harder like real analysis, proving the theory behind calculus. A first upper division course you should take or after linear algebra (upper division). Depends on the teacher and book. Like rudin is considered hard and the standard while I took an easier teacher and text – but that was the time I dropped out. Calculus ain’t easy, but if you enjoy math and have math abilities, you can do it. No point in skipping pre-calculus. Some people think pre-calculus is harder because of the amount of review and material. I took 3 semesters of calculus and then dropped out of a math major at year 4."
176069287,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I think anything and everything feels like way too much for me right now. I haven’t been getting enough alone and empty time too so that doesn’t help.

176069301,"I get annoyed with cuddling, always have. I would rather it be all the way or leave me alone. He has it rough, he didn’t have a good family life cause of things his brother did to his sister, that his dad knew about. Just a ??????? mess. He’s the only family member to not have tried killing himself. Then his dad was abusive and bipolar to the point of he did everything he could to game the system, opened up credit cards in hubby’s name as a teenager, etc. So when we got pregnant and we were living and paying rent for the upstairs, his dad repeatedly sexually assaulted me and threatened to kick me out and all sorts of ????. We moved out asap but I never told hubby till his dad died, and part of me kinda resents him for his dad, it’s a mess. It’s not his fault, but sometimes he unintentionally will say a phrase his dad said, something he grew up with, and I’m ?????? up from PTSD flashbacks, and I can’t be around him. We’ve been going to therapy for years. I just am not able to forgive 
him for something that wasn’t his fault. If he had known, well, he’d be in prison for murder and then what good would that have done. But I am working with a therapist for all this, so it’s harder to explain everything."
176069302,"I feel this way about my family, especially my mother, try to see how far she can push boundaries of making me feel insignificant. In fact sometimes communicating with them makes me feel so down I get suicidal. She’s still tapping in my roof and walls to victimize me. They like the just before sleep and just awake vulnerability to really make their best effort of impact. Stalking sleeking around, training their dogs to follow / intimidate me. Playing 1001 games upon games games, the new one is the lookalike game. No wonder I was so angry Running around yelling out I’m in danger danger Please leave me alone."

176069306,You really need to talk to your psychiatrist. Your case manager is just a “civilian”. An antidepressant can cut down your anxiety and also stop these dark thoughts. But mention how you feel to your psychiatrist for sure.

176069319,"It’s hard not to think you are a God when people tell you this. I mean not in this life or most lives (if you believe in ‘reincarnation’). I mean they think the Bitcoin creator is some sort of God just like _NAME_ was in the math community-- the greatest scientist of all time… It’s hard when you are running the simulation and can create things and destroy things and manipulate things outside like a video game and the inhabitants are us. I never truly figured out everything or the tech. It’s just aliens playing God. It’s amazing and truly scary when you can see and predict the future. I mean I think we’re heading war, solar flare, alien invasion in the next 3 years. 2023. Humanity is out of control. We could be heading for a computer reset like in a video game. I don’t know. I experience consciousness transfer so I have multiple consciousness in me.

embering stuff now. Even remember the British winning again in the future. It could be a combinations of endorphins (even now) but I’m not manic. I don’t experience mania. I have unusual religious beliefs. I mean I was tortured by aliens to believe in Christianity.

176069324,"I feel what you’re saying. I have an extremely negative self image too. I hate myself and I want to die unless I’m getting constant reassurance that I’m good and I’m loved. It’s awful. It’s part of my schema. I don’t know how we can combat this. I’ve tried to calm and reassure myself the best I can but I still just hate myself and want to die a lot of the time. I stay alive because it would hurt the people I left behind too much for me to leave them that way. Oh yeah, there are good days too. And times that I’m not so focused on it. So I try to stay positive the best I can and try not to dwell. I wish there was some type of therapy we could do that would change it."

176069345,I had another delusion but it was later when I stopped my meds. For me the prepsychosis time and the 1st psychosis were worse than other psychosis. I thought that I will be married to a virgin girl in Heaven and that I should die before marrying her.

176069351,"It brings back memories of a friend who was a hooker in my drug days. Our relationship was mainly doing drugs and maybe, kinda fooling around a little bit but one night I was over at her apartment with a friend and another friend of hers and she decided to cook a spaghetti dinner for everybody. So all us addicts sat around her kitchen table and ate and afterwards somehow we all ended up playing _PERSON_. I mean back then it seemed normal but now I can see the incongruity of it. While we were playing people kept coming to the door and she would go into the bathroom with them and shoot heroin and then the person would leave and she would come back and resume playing _PERSON_ with us. It was all a bit weird."

174359628,"You might want to ask your doctor about other partial agonists rather than abilify if you couldn’t tolerate it, or something else, like Modafinil in addition. With me we tried lowering dosages, but it ended up being just schizophrenia, not abilify that’s causing my negatives."

176069390,Often people conflate high protein with sufficient protein to maintain muscle mass and metabolism. Another confusion is between protein-containing foods and protein itself. Typically an ounce of animal foods contains 6-7 grams of protein. A typical rule of thumb protein RDA is one to two grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass. You might want to look at the requirements for your level of activity and calculate your macronutrients from there for your particular style of diet and goals.

176069429,"The first guy who asked me was a delivery driver. I just think he’s a social drinker not an alcoholic. Can control his drinking so it doesn’t interfere with his job, something I could’ve never done before meds. The second person was the girl who is probably most in charge other than the owner. But she’s always saying “ I’m not the manager I’m not the manager” Insisting she’s not against me in any way. It was right as I was dropping her off she mentioned wine and was thrown off a little when I had no reaction at all. I don’t think she was testing me. But rather interested in my response maybe."

174359629,Even though this is a horrible illness it has made me grow a a lot. I am much more aware of my everyday life and have worked hard on improving myself.

176069436,"I had a really hard time accepting that I was sick. As they say, “reality is perception.” So where do we fit in? My suggestion is to follow your doctor’s orders until you feel more normal. Then you can make choices about moving forward. Your choices will be more reliable when you feel like yourself."
176069437,"There are only two things someone can ever do and they are love or cry for help. Of course there are different ways to love and different ways to cry for help, but in the end all action boils down to these two things. In both instances the correct response is love. Love, without pleasure is not love. Loving what you are doing brings pleasure. I am still trying to motivate myself to do something productive, but I cannot bring myself to love anything other than writing and processing my thoughts, eating and drinking, smoking and sleeping. This is my cry for help. Thank you."

176069441,I don’t know. Maybe talk to your pdoc about trying a different drug combination if they are not doing the trick for you? Seems like you are pretty med resistant so I dunno what the best advice is in your case.

I think that sometimes, work is naturally going to get in the way. Make it when you can, try to make therapy a priority, and otherwise, just do what you have to do. _AT_MENTION_ That’s awful! I am very fortunate to have a pdoc who really understands me. She doesn’t even charge me missed appointment fees because she knows about my problems leaving my room. She always replies to my questions ASAP, and she gives me a lot of leeway in my own care. I can’t imagine just being abandoned by a pdoc like that. I’m sorry."
176069460,"Well first gen APs are less likely to make one fat, right? Like Haldol beats Latuda in terms of weight gain. I hated Haldol with a passion because I felt so miserable on it.

176069469,"Just need to rant and feel like I’m being heard. Sorry if this is annoying. I work at an assisted living place and do mainly bath aide shifts. So I’m getting residents dressed, do their laundry, housekeeping, helping them with showers, and essentially any other physical cares. I also do some meds here and there. At my workplace you work every other weekend and on my weekend to work it’s incredibly stressful because we are always understaffed. The other weekend has two extra people plus the normal weekend shifts are full. My coworkers and I have voiced this to managers and nothing has been changed. Recently a coworker messed her ankle up really bad. They are still having her work but she can only do a small portion of the housekeeping. Management and scheduling decided to combine two shifts together on the weekend that the hurt coworker works. Which is my weekend. These two shifts are both bath aide shifts and they happen at the same time. One is 6AM- 2:30PM the other is 6:30AM-2:30PM. So now 
I have to work two shifts at once, in the same amount of time as one shift on a weekend that is already understaffed. This morning I got told by management that they dont understand why me and my coworkers struggle so much on the weekends, that there’s no reason for us to be saying that it’s bad, that the other weekend is just fine, that the combined shift isnt bad because its ‘just housekeeping’ (which is very much not true) They got rid of most showers on the weekend but theres still all the other cares you have to do. It’s just frustrating because we are all trying our best and working hard to stay caught up on the weekends and it’s not working just to be told that theres no reason for us to be struggling like we are."

I don’t want to give up hope, but early on I was told I had paranoid schizophrenia and treatment resistant undifferentiated schizophrenia. Not everyone agrees. Plus, I got Aspergers, although a mild form. I had DP/DR a severe case. I had symptoms of depression, OCD, and anxiety. Pretty much the stuff that goes with schizophrenia. I tried going back to school but always fail. I have cognitive deficits and no motivation. My hygiene is really bad. I tried volunteering but got super paranoid. I sort of wish life was easier and I had more money, but my family MIGHT leave me a tiny amount of money. It’s supposed to supplement social security after they die, but you never know. It could be nothing or much less than I expect. My brother and sister might have to step in 5-10 years from now. I don’t know. My former psychologist said his uncle was schizophrenic and he just talked and talked 
about getting better but it never happened. He’s seen it a lot and said I was very similar. I don’t understand how I can get a 3 year review if I’m considered 100% permanently disabled.

174359673,"Better ask a psychiatrist but here’s Wikipedia: “Brexpiprazole has more blocking and less stimulating activity at the dopamine receptors than its predecessor, aripiprazole, which may decrease its risk for agitation and restlessness. Specifically, where aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity or agonist effect at the D2 receptor of 60%+, brexpiprazole has an intrinsic activity at the same receptor of about 45%. For aripiprazole, this means more dopamine receptor activation at lower doses, with blockade being reached at higher doses, whereas brexpiprazole is the opposite. By contrast, brexpiprazole has a much higher affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor than aripiprazole as well as a much higher intrinsic activity. In vivo characterization of brexpiprazole shows that it may act as a near-full agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor. This may further underlie a lower potential than aripiprazole to cause treatment-emergent, movement-related disorders such as akathisia due to the downstream dopamine release that i
s triggered by 5-HT1A receptor agonism.”"

When I’m starting to get manic, I wake up after 4 hours fully rested and ready for my day, then start to get a bit delirious towards the afternoon, but no matter what I end up having trouble getting to sleep and then waking up totally energetic after 4 hours or so. 5-6 hours of sleep is still a healthy amount of sleep, provided you don’t feel tired during the day, but since you are feeling tired during the day it could be worth talking to a doctor about. Melatonin, valerian root, Benadryl, and Unisom are over the counter sleep aids that are generally safe to take (provided you don’t mix them with alcohol) and you can ask the pharmacist any questions about them. I’m personally allergic to valerian root so I don’t like it, but Mr. Star loves it. Alcohol dependency can cause sleep disturbances, whether you drank that day or not.

174359675,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits in mice are ameliorated by subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine: Role of BDNF-TrkB signaling. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior , Dec 2019 19 The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists including phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine produce cognitive deficits in rodents and humans. We previously reported that (R)-ketamine produced the beneficial effects compared to (S)-ketamine in several animal models including depression. Here we compared the effects of two enantiomers of ketamine on cognitive deficits in mice after repeated administration of PCP. PCP (10 mg/kg/day for 10 days)-induced cognitive deficits were ameliorated by subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly for 2-weeks), but not (S)-ketamine. Western blot analysis showed decreased levels of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and decreased ratio of phosphorylated-TrkB (p-TrkB) to TrkB in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of PCP-treated mice. Furthermore, PCP-induced reduction of BDNF and p-TrkB/TrkB ratio in the PFC and hippocampus of PCP-treated mice was ameliorated by subsequent intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine were blocked by pretreatment with TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. These findings suggest that (R)-ketamine could ameliorate PCP-induced cognitive deficits via activation of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the brain. Therefore, (R)-ketamine could be a potential therapeutic drug for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia."

The ratings of SAS, BARS, PANSS, CDSS, and CGI-S and adverse ef
fects (AE) were recorded in every visit.SAS total scores decreased significantly during the study in patients with DIP (P<0.001), and mild AEs were detected. Treatments with pramipexole did not show an anti-akathisia effect during the study, while 2 subjects experienced deterioration of akathisia and mood symptoms. The psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia showed a trend of improvement during the study, but there was no improvement in depressive mood.A low dose of pramipexole can significantly relieve antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism, but not akathisia. Improvements in psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia were found, but the results of this study need to be validated in a larger sample. No improvement of mood disorder was detected."

I have been through a lot probably more than I give credit for. Funny there was probably a turning point. I had a severe marijuana addiction bought on from AP depression. The marijuana gave great pleasure and appreciation of music. God I was lucky to get off that stuff it is such a waste of money. It happened because i started feeling extreme anxiety the marijuana was no longer working due to tolerance. And due to that anxiety i became structured i stopped that and stayed on the same injection dose the whole time i was on it after a 25% reduction after first starting it. The whole time I was on the injection I took nutritional supplements to mitigate the damage and likely dyskinesia. How helpful was that? Probably only of modest benefit. I have been through much and many different states of mind. Then as soon as I was able to I 
switched to another psychotropic substance which was the ONLY option based on my extensive research. The only thing worth investing the effort into taking

A lot of his theories have been proven wrong anyways. It just depends on what you want to believe. To the best of my knowledge there is still no definitive answer as to what dreams mean, if anything. Theories range from “experts” claiming dreams are just little movies that go on while we sleep to the extreme of _PERSON_ and some others thinking that every dream means something and everything in them is symbolic. The fact that this dream triggered you is real. But it doesn’t mean it’s going to really happen. The fact that you would never do the stuff in that dream in real life shows you how inaccurate dreams are. The dream doesn’t mean anything, it’s what it triggers in real life, if it is still effecting you, that is important. My dad told me when I was 20 years old, everybody has sex problems so

176069721,"I recently moved to a new place in America and went to my new doctor and asked to be prescribed my one medication that I’ve used for a long time to treat my symptoms of SZ and that works for me. Imagine having a prescribed medication that works and then having a new doctor tell you they do not like to prescribe that medication or they do not prescribe that medication as a primary way of treating SZ. The medication is Klonopin and I’ve bee prescribed one milligram taken daily and I’ve been able to be in relationships, and work as a Truck Driver. I can only guess that due to the addictive nature of this benzo, due to the addiction epidemic in this country and dangers of mixing alcohol and opiates resulting in death - that these are the reasons they have bias against it - I take it as prescribed and am able to live a decent life - my life isn’t great but considering everything it is pretty good. Who do I turn to for help with the medical field will not? Trying to see a pyschiatrist is a joke c
ause if you actually find one that is accepting new patients the wait time is months - In the mean time I need to look for a job I lost after signing a lease I now cannot afford and my girl friend has decided to leave me due to my irritability after the disuse of klonopin. I’m scared I’ll wind up dead on the street and of course no one will care - Do please help. Who can I turn to for help? The police cold likely respond but from watching media that seems like a horrible idea since they shoot the mentally ILL - Should I go to the emergency room? The support and care is dismal for many of us - one only needs to go to California to see the misery in the homeless sections there. If I die then that is not fair to my family and friends."

176069787,I have gained over seven kg from this time last year. I had a good weight this time last year . I was not eating much I ate belvita breakfast biscuits for breakfast weightwatchers bar for lunch lots of coffee and whatever I want for dinner including fried food. I was not exercising then. Exercise does not make me lose weight. Exercise makes me gain weight. As soon as I started exercising I put on weight as I started eating more and craving food more strongly. Now I have been letting myself eat chocolate and ice cream etc and the bad thing is I eat the whole chocolate.not just a bit but all of it. Like I was with alcohol.no stop. I am almost a full blown vegan and am in the process of becoming vegan but there are vegan biscuits and vegan Icecreams etc Now that I’m exercising three days a week I want to eat more and I don’t want to be to strict on myself but I still want to lose some weight. Although I noticed my taste in woman is different than the body I expect of myself. Woman I am attracted to 
seem to have s normal body weight or be a bit chubby. My x had a biiiig belly and I thought he is so beautiful just as he is. He has long hair down past his waist. Great looking tattoos etc I might have a normal bmi. I am a size 10 but it’s getting tight. My jeans are really tight on me now and if this keeps going they will soon not fit me. I always used to be smaller except on medication… I put on over twenty four kg on olanzapine but now I’m on latuda I have gained weight but not that much thankfully.

Perhaps, I still struggle to doubt the individual pieces of the whole episode. But, I try to cut my experiences into as many pieces as possible, so I doubt each of those pieces more and more.

I take it between 6-6:30 a.m. and I take Melatonin to get to sleep around 9 p.m. When I first started Zyprexa, I took it at bedtime, expecting it to be sedating. I got ZERO sleep that first night. The next two nights, I took it at bedtime and only slept because I took 1 mg of Klonopin at 2 a.m. Then I decided to try taking it first thing in the morning. Bingo. I now have energy throughout the day and no longer nap. I naturally wake up between 6-6:30 now and that’s the start of my day."

As time goes on, I hope you will learn to deal with the ilness more and learn to love yourself, despite your faults. Both the real and completely normal faults and the ones you are imagining or that maybe the voices are throwing at you. The voices are not to be listened to. They are hallucinations.

I trained as a school psychologist before I got kicked out of my internship, and therefore the program, because of my impulsivity due to my mental illness. I can tell you that IQ scores mean nothing in the real world, and are only used to determine special education services in school-aged children. People with SZ/SZA are not inherently less intelligent than your neurotypical population. That being said, I do not believe that SZ/SZA is curable. But, you can fulfill your destiny at being the best you can be, even with a disease like ours. Having a diagnosis of SZ/SZA does not automatically mean you can’t function, that you can’t be independent. I have 3 higher education degrees in different subjects and I’m going for my fourth now.

174359763,"I grew up with a mum who was pretty detached from objective reality & raised me with her beliefs (some mainstream, some uniquely hers). I remember reaching an age where I started to realise the difference between her world & the “world of the majority” & I started routinely performing reality checks (subconsciously) to help me differentiate between the two. I even went off & studied physics at university in a kind of rebellion effort. Anyway, when I started getting psychosis symptoms about 2.5 years ago it was really weird because I had all this stuff happening to me but I also had all these checks in place. So I was always kind of AWARE that what I was experiencing wasn’t “real” but of course that didn’t make it FEEL or look or hear less real. Anyway, when it finally dawned on me that maybe I couldn’t handle it all on my own with my checks & balances I went to see a doctor & he gave me an sz diagnosis. I remember thinking as a scientist “oh that makes sense” & I still feel that w
ay even though I don’t think about it as a disease so much as a clinical explanation for how my brain is wired. I dunno…it’s complicated because I kinda feel like a fake schizophrenic in that regard. I know it is very much an illness for most people but I really just can’t think of it that way for myself. The things I experience that are labelled “schizophrenia” are just who I am & I kind of resent the thought that I might need to be “fixed” of it."

174359779,"I may be a psychologists that has experienced a little bit of schizophrenia. I say “may” because I am not a very good psychologist nor schizophrenic. As far as I know, auditor hallucinations and thoughts are both very quiet speech (so called “subvocal speech”). This means that they have a very and objectively measurable element. That thoughts are very quiet speech is, for example, the basis of practical work by NASA to allow astronauts to control computers with their thoughts (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, 2005). Regarding auditory hallucinations, there is still some controversy, but at the very least subvocal speech is related to auditory hallucinations. Back in 1948-1950 a psychologists called _NAME_ taped microphones to the throats of schizophrenics, and found that there were more subvocalisations during auditory hallucinations, and even used a stethoscope to the vocal cords of schizophrenics, to allow a transcriber to record almost identical words to those which the schizophrenic “hallucinated.
” I think a problem arises when attempting to classify such subvocal thought as either external or internal. On the face of it, subvocalisations are internal in the sense that we generate them with our bodies, and in a sense external in that they are bodily rather than arising from within the mind. Where is the problem? My only experience of psychosis (other than my ongoing paranoia) was the realisation that my thoughts were simply my voice. It came as a shock because till that point, and to a large extent now, I identified with the first person of my thoughts, as a sort of psychological entity that I presumed to be in my mind. My mind blowing, life changing, and psychotic, experience seemed to tell me two things: The same conclusion as espoused by NASA and _PERSON_ – that thoughts are just very quiet voice. And this was shocking enough, since I thought that “I” (just a word!) was me, and still do. Not only were my thoughts external in the sense of being created by my body as just my voice rather than 
‘arising from within,’ but also that there was a double fantasy going on. Not only was I presuming myself to be my voice (fantasy #1 ) but also there was a hidden fantasy (fantasy #2 ) of someone hearing those thoughts, and perhaps speaking them. The experience had essentially the same structure as ventriloquism. Ventriloquists create two fantasies: They animate a puppet, pretending the puppet is a person (corresponding to my thoughts) They pretend there is person who believes in and talks to the the puppet (in ventriloquism this is obvious if you think about it for a second, but in my mind it is the hidden second fantasy). Thus, when a schizophrenic says “I heard my relative speak to me,” this would seem to be a fantasy in the sense that that the relative is not simply creating those sounds in the normal way, but at the same time, it may contain a greater degree of truth that generally experienced by normies (including myself now) who are not aware that their thoughts are generated by another (fantas
ised) person. And bearing in mind all the above, it is not clear to me what a person is, or the exact difference between a fantasised person and a non fantasised person – if all people are to extent fantasies. Perhaps one might argue that that schizophrenics are to an extent exaggerating the externality of subvocal speech, whereas normies are to an equal extent, underplaying it. Addendum Quite a lot of psychologists, and philosophers, now claim that the self is a fantasy (e.g. _PERSON_, 1992), and that there are “others in mind” (e.g. _PERSON_, 2009) but rarely is the hallucinatory, fantastic element of normie experience emphasised. It is just treated as normal. Bibliography _PERSON_, D. C. (1992). The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.

176069953,As it was 36 years ago that I was last in psych hospital(before 'Care in the community ’ really got going) I can’t comment about modern psych hospital stays.
176069954,I take Clonazepam - .50 Mg every night mixed with 65Mg of Benadryl for sleep. The first brand I was taking kept my mind stable but was causing memory issues. The new one they prescribed has less memory issues but it’s not as effective as the last one but it seems to be workin so far. I’ve been taking it for more than 8 months now everyday.
176069955,Oh okay… so am I.
176069956,Is that even possible… because I keep thinking the worst to happen my psychiatrist felt I might have an element of ptsd following psychosis
176069957,Sz cured my ocd.
176069958,That’s great _NAME_! I’m happy for you!

176069963,That’s beautiful! It’s gonna turn out very good.
176069964,What med are you on? And what is the mgs? and have you ever experienced akathisia?
174359782,"Would you take Vraylar in place of or in addition to another antipsychotic? I have heard that it works well against negative symptoms. I have also heard that it doesn’t always work for positive/psychosis symptoms. My psychiatrist and I have discussed it before. He said he doesn’t hate it, gets very few complaints about side effects but it only works about 1/2 the time. This is for bipolar. My daughter is on it for bipolar and she loves it. She said she got tremors (sounded like akathisia) on the lowest dose, 1.5mg every day and was told to cut back to every other day. I am susceptible to akathisia, to me it is the worst side effect."
176069965,"The entities that mess with me day and night have showed me they control the media. This includes what happens with laptop, phone, TV etc. I won’t go into detail about what they did, but it is what made me stop watching TV since 2015. I continue to live in constant paranoia, terror, and anxiousness because of the monitoring and abuse that they conduct on me. They have told me that dark forces blessed my heart and put a curse on me and I have had multiple constant night terrors every night since they came into my life. I deal with these voices/entities day and night for these reasons. It’s constant emotional and mental work which makes it nearly impossible to interact with people for long periods of time."
176069966,"Watch out for extra supplements. I guess caffeine-based supplements are OK, but you’ll get dependent on them."
176069967,"I am too. It took moving to be near my stepdaughter,and coming under a different pdoc etc, to get the dx."
176069968,Best of luck
176069969,Basically I cannot remember. Its driving me insane trying. Other than that im good. I might never recover or move on.
176069970,"Flagging is encouraged to help mods find posts that are breaking rules or can be dangerous. I flag suicidal pos ts with a note “needs the suicide information” sometimes. Wheb peopleare flat out trolling or encouraging delusions then you are in the right to flag. Ifpeoplehave a pro blem with that, oh well. They can’t see ifyouflag or notso don’t worry about it. People who break rules or troll always whine when caught. Some like to use their illness as an excuse to be an as!shat. Tough. I’ve been flagged and had posts deleted. I don’t whine about it. Because I know when I’ve been an as!s."
176069971,I think its in vogue or “in” to be mentally ill right now. Especially among celebrities and musicians. No one has called me “schizo” before but I’ve been called wacko and cuckoo before by my father. I’ve been diagnosed with all of these silly labels and I’m obsessed with my diagnosis. It’s gotten to the point where being stuck with these labels don’t mean much to me anymore. This society is obsessed with labels though. This is for sure.

176069975,Ask your doctor to put you on Geodon and Seroquel. They’re not nearly as harsh. They’ve controlled my symptoms for a decade and a half.

176069980,My title was Main Banker but I spent most of my shifts as the cigarette cage cashier.
176069981,They told me so many things and made me so delusional. I didn’t interact with them once I just listened
176069982,"Well, that’s possible. But not probable. I see my own paranoia in you. I believe similar stuff sometimes and reading this makes me realize that my family and case manager are right when they tell me my neighbors aren’t doing anything to me. Well, not much anyways."
174359799,"_AT_MENTION_ , I have no clozapinophobia anymore. I hope you try it too"
176069983,"What all those guys said above. Makes sense. I find it weird to have a personal relationship with a therapist or doctor. It’s different in USA, I guess. I don’t expect them to be too friendly. As they say in America, we are clients or consumers. Pretty cold if you ask me. They’re often overloaded with clients and are super busy. I had thoughts that APs caused or worsened my negatives too, but I can’t do anything about it. I asked for stimulants, and they said no."

176070000,What explains so many solipsists?? The same reason there are so many religions. People are looking for explanations. Sometimes I think it’s weird to be multiple solipsists. Like there could only be one person that truly created the universe with his/her mind. So there’s fake solipsists out there??? People that aren’t real claiming to be all that’s real?? Well I know I am real. I could just be computer simulated to say that though. I’m starting to more doubt the simulation theory and just settle with I don’t have the answers ever. At least not now. Although I do find it interesting
176070001,"Its typically sz this? Why’s that??? Because of the paranoia you think? Its not easy to have lived in isolation for 20 years… I cant continue to be like that anymore… My pdoc told me, that i went sick, cause i closed in myself…So now i’ll shout, i’ll cry, i’ll scream, i’ll share to my close people when its bad, maybe this can change… Its very hard to see all my sz friends have gotten fixed on things like this from their meds, while me, i feel nothing on the zyprexa… Ok, at least i am on my feet, so maybe it helps. But i still have no life… tbh, its seems to me, that i wanted way too many things before, now i aim more simple things, maybe its a progress…"

I do let my son play outdoors at my fathers place, he just has 1 friend there he always plays with. My dad also still goes for groceries etc. I am not afraid to get it, but i am afraid to spread it if i have it. Here they also say a major part of the country will get sick, maybe half. They kind of accept that, just hope to spread it out over a longer time period for health care to stay available. Someone i know was in spain…there they were ordered to stay inside. Here they dont have a total lock down."

174359800,"Abilify doesn’t work for everyone. I was a bit unstable on it, although I was never hospitalized while I was taking it."
176070008,"I think some people view gold and metals markets and the markets in particular as being manipulated. _PERSON_ recently suggested “bitcoin was too high” and it dropped from 57k to 47k. Bitcoin is modern gold or whatever you want to call it. Some people say it’s just an asset while other people view it as money. Bitcoin is either overvalued or undervalued. I think it’s undervalued. I believe in the long term economics of it. I will be cutting back on my drinking and buying some sliver of bitcoin each month so I hope it drops a bit because it’s cheaper. I think most people who know what they’re doing think that. Microstrategy ceo said in the news (IIRC) bitcoin future market cap is 100 trillion dollars. That’s quite optimistic. If it hits 10 trillion that’s great because that roughly means 500k a coin. I think it could hit 20 trillion market cap but I don’t know when. A lot of folks say sooner than later, but then get it wrong. I think I’m safe to say it’s going to take 50-100 ye
ars to cap it roughly 2140 when the last bitcoin is mined rofl. I mean it can either be worth zero, tank some more, or hit the moon. The sky is the limit. Everyone needs freaking money. Nobody can survive without it."

176070022,Ive been feeling normal lately. Youre as normal as you believe. Whos to say what is the right way how to think or act or live? Peer pressure? We can only do things how we can sometimes for unknown or known reasons.
176070023,"Yes. I had adblocker, and all sorts of apps but eventually got rid of most of them. I use google chrome on a normal HP computer. I’m scared to write anything about myself online anymore. I have a pretty advanced windows computer with all the firewalls etc. and yet they are tracking every single thing I say or do online. I had adblock and I couldn’t open articles anymore because when I opened articles they demanded I turn off adblocker. It stopped working on youtube too, so I had to get rid of it. And it didn’t prevent the pandora ads. This has been happening all year and for awhile. But it’s gotten even more targeted within the past four months. Sometimes I feel like even my keystrokes are being tracked. My mom once was about to search something, and it was already typed into google before she searched it. My search history has linked to my mom’s cellphone before so it’s obviously over the network and people are seeing it. There is no internet privacy or security. HIPPA is supposed to p
rotect personal health information. Banks are supposed to protect personal financial data. I have been attacked on all these fronts due to technology and people who are good at covering their tracks.

174359807,"A quote from the great _NAME_: “ In a traditional society, if you exhibited “schizophrenic” tendencies, you are immediately drawn out of the pack and put under the care and tutelage of master shamans. You are told: “You are special. Your abilities are very central to the health of our society. You will cure. You will prophesy. You will guide our society in its most fundamental decisions.” Contrast this with what a person exhibiting schizophrenic activity in our society is told. They’re told: “You don’t fit in. You are becoming a problem. You don’t pull your own weight. You are not of equal worth to the rest of us. You are sick. You have to go to the hospital. You have to be locked up.” – You are on a par with prisoners and lost dogs in our society. So that treatment of schizophrenia makes it incurable.”"

Plus, it helps me to get ready for some of the things I would need in the future. Did you feel like nothing was real after you got injured? I just felt like my doctor was lying to me.

Sure, cars break down but you can minimize the time and expense of repairs by taking preventive actions like regular oil changes for instance.

Now my bottle has run out and so I can see what it was doing. Anxiety and mild distress have returned Appetite has increased. I’m finding it difficult to stick to my 1900 calories a day Worrying has returmed My desire to take L-theanine to cope has come back as a result Ive ordered more bottles from iherb. https://www.iherb.com/pr/Source-Naturals-Broccoli-Sprouts-Extract-60-Tablets/2456

176070069,I was diagnosed 2 years ago and I still don’t accept it.
176070070,Mine I had some when my mom died. They called it acute schizophrenia. Then it went away for a while until I was 34(?) after my son was born. After my son was born it started back up.
176070071,Are those symptoms of withdrawal dose dependent?
176070072,I know! All c-sections…ugh
176070073,im making progress on my work my art seems to have improved my bird has been super happy and easy to talk to today
176070074,I’m sorry to hear this. I hope you feel better.
176070075,Thanks _AT_MENTION_!!!
176070076,Idk just trying to ignore my thoughts
176070077,Ah yeah. Illness is just a lack of self control. Nice one.
176070078,I think it’s best to not share delusions with others. But I know first hand it can be hard to be quiet when u’re having an episod.
176070079,"Yeah, it’s interesting for sure"
176070080,Sorry about all that but if you drove you really be a mess. Just saying. Love peace and cheer. _PERSON_
176070081,does anything make your mood become happy?
176070082,"Yes, I don’t need suggestions of activities, I need help to learn to love doing the activities that I want to do. I don’t know if such help is possible"
176070083,Hope it stays like now.Do you have any idea why that happened?
174359824,Yeah it’s the meds that helped but now I understand … like not only did it stop I get it that it’s impossible and now don’t suffer any form of it
176070084,I haven’t met my new psychiatrist yet so idk what she will think… but i think that my old one prescribed the meds and didnt think of the possible side effects

176070092,"Have you not tried l tyrosine before? It works similar to wellbutrin increasing dopamine and epinephrine. But the problem of these is that the effect is temporary and soon dopamine down regulation take place requiring upping the dose which starts to create problems like heart palpitations, insomnia and other things."

174359825,Cool. I wish the machines were more affordable though.
176070095,Very cool _AT_MENTION_ . I do like a good hobby but my attention span can be lax. I think your doing really well and your concentration I admire. I’m getting better but it’s a work in progress. Well done you.

I am very sensible to those kind of emotions of her… She blames me also to not act… I guess ill take them for a time now and maybe try without them, once the situation here turns calmer…"
176070098,The only one I can remember was my first CD player
176070099,"Strange. Im on a way higher dose upto 600mg i can take, and that has never happened to me. You sure it wasnt anxiety?"
176070100,"I am not convinced that supplements help. AP’s are so powerful, I just don’t buy that natural ingredients can help in anyway when we have to take such medications to help. AP’s and Benzos are no where near off the shelf assistance. These are serious medicines."
176070101,Glad they seemed understanding with you not taking it. I think you made the right choice. I used to take it for insomnia and it was awful.

176070110,that is a beautiful poem
176070111,I don’t really feel like I’m searching for it so much any more… but I certainly was for a while. I just get irked at being alone in life all the time. It doesn’t take much support for me to be good… but when there is absolutely no one around that has concern for me… I get stuck just wishing I had a girlfriend again. Someone who already knows me so I’m not stuck having to explain myself all the time. All my male friends are bizarrely competitive and not very sympathetic.

176070121,"No. And if you believe that, You are delusional. All of us would love to believe that, It’s the easy way to deal with schizophrenia. I was much happier when I was lost in my delusions, they gave me purpose, Which is probably what they are giving you too. It’s much harder to accept that you are sick and fight it. You are not special or some sort of crusader because you have schizophrenia, You’re just sick."

176070125,"Yes, it’s weird. Do you think it’s cool to have sz? It’s terrifying when you can’t trust your own mind. When you’re not sure what you’re experiencing is real it’s scary. It’s like you make a mockery of it. Because you like the art?"
176070126,A wise man once told me ‘everything is not about you’ and that’s what paranoia feels like – psychosis. I don’t know.
176070127,Thank you so much. You made my year 2019 and hopefully years to come.
176070128,Yes its sad and I have to constantly remind myself that I will be on meds for the rest of my life. That’s why I think I may just ask to take the injections again because I won’t have to remember to take pills every night and day. I have to stop fighting with myself. One reason I am doing well/have been doing ok is that I was constantly trying to follow the advice and therapy. I wish I could wish it away. But this is a real disease. It sucks. But i can maintain normal as much as I can without having to flush all my pills away.
176070129,"Close. I was 32, but it was years in the making."
176070130,That’s awesome! I’m planning on going for a walk later tonight when the temperature is nice and cool.
176070131,"Thats great i hope you and pray your goals get done, but i know you will. Sorry to put God in the picture God always has a plan for everybody he cares about your goals he will help you achieve them."
176070132,It’s not so much the smartness as I wouldn’t think myself smart but I typically don’t have any other symptoms not even negative anymore … but that’s not enough reason I guess. I shouldn’t worry too much as the meds work and i don’t have side effects

174359835,Your negative symptoms?
176070135,"I would say a mixture of experiences. I now think the number one treatment in the hospital is forced boredom. There are activities that I think a person who wants to get better should do. I know sometimes in my experience there was still suffering in some form while in the hospital. There were often times when I was angered by the requirements of hospital routine, such as when to take my meds or how to obtain a better gown. I was angry at times. There was also often, thankfully, intensive care by talking to a staff person, or other great expressions of great care. The art of care for the ill is studied by experts in nursing. Sad but true, sometimes a little adversity is in the plan. For example, not being able to watch TV at certain times, or not being allowed to watch your pick on TV. Or getting put in isolation as punishment for anger or acting out. Or being denied your favorites sometimes. I think they call it, “red pepper.” The activities in the hospital are pretty small, like making a clay 
object. Don’t be insulted, just do whatever the activities are. Attend group therapy, even if it isn’t even about you. You can be friends with other patients. Like _NAME_ says, “Just show up!” You are not in the hospital to lay in bed sleeping. Are we sleeping in the hospital??"
176070136,Sending you extra gentle hugs.
176070137,"i could only get into bodybuilding if i get a non physical job, because im sore for a week after i lift. but i do have a home gym. i would like to shape my traps, shoulders, back, arms, and keep my pecs kinda small. o also nice legs. my cousin is an amateur bodybuilder, he is ripped, competes against 20 or 30 years olds for shows and is 47 years old himself. we were talking about it over labor day."
176070138,"I have many of them. Reading these makes me feel less alone. My current belief that I’m trying to shake is that if I go off the medications I will somehow evolve heightened electrical brain activity, where I will become telekinetic and astral project more frequently. The problem is that through hypnosis is how it all started, and I went way too deep. I saw my “astral double” a body of light, and I secretly believe that I wandered off too far in my sleep and broke the “silver chord” that connects the spirit or astral body to the physical human body. I think that’s pretty out there to be honest. I probably just practiced hypnosis so much that I put myself into extremely deep states and couldn’t pull myself out of them. I don’t think that’s what caused my illness, I’ve always been a sort of psycho-naut or someone who wants to explore the consciousness. This is why I will never do shrooms. Or trip, or anything. Because I don’t want to become everything, I haven’t figured out how 
to not freak out when I become one with the universe. Enlightenment is not easy. So that’s why Shamans do it and I guess if I were a Shaman I wouldn’t need pills. Ughhh, it’s just difficult being me. It’s difficult having this disease of wanting to know everything. I remember one movie, I think it was Shutter Island…they said _PERSON_ was crazy too–he went too deep."

176070148,Do you know how they work like are they dopamine antagonist or partial dopamine agonist…?
176070149,"I agree, the outcome you should be expecting is a termination with cause. Unfortunately I’m finding out that my my irritability might similarly be triggered by my mom and her own sense of entitled anger, and I need a solution that solves my anger problem or at least lets me cope without getting furiously mad in the moment and saying something because I need some sort of emotional attack to vent my frustrations. Its a human problem. I also disagree that the consequences would be well you had insanity…that defense is not really for schizophrenics suffering a bout of anger due to hostility, its in response to a full blown psychotic break where the structure of your rational mind becomes unwound and you follow a logic that is completely out of wack with reality."

176070151,"Once my family was driving home from a friend’s house that lived in a wooded area. I was probably about twelve and sitting in the “way back” of our station wagon. It was night, so I could barely see it, but something was chasing our vehicle. The tail lights were just bright enough to illuminate a creature. When we turned to the highway it continued to follow us, That’s when I got a good look at it. It looked humanish, but running on all fours. I was terrified, so (coming from a religious family) I prayed for it to go away. That’s when it caught up to us and strangely passed the car. I watched as it ran into the car in front of us. Seconds later that car ran a red light and got t-boned by another oncoming vehicle. The accident was in the time before cell phones, So my dad had to pull over and help. One person was unconscious the other was crying and looking for his teeth that had been knocked out. I wonder about that today. If what I think is following me is real. There are other stories, 
but none like that. I tell others all the time that their delusions are coincidences and that’s what I’m trying to tell myself. This one is just hard to write off."

176070157,"I found this type of therapy on a google search Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) What It Is: Anxiety may also be a product of maladaptive, automatic cognitive processes that instigate inappropriate reactions. Mindfulness teaches people to be aware of their thoughts, feelings, and sensations from moment to moment without judgment or blame. A mindfulness practice aims to achieve a higher state of awareness for the present moment. How It Addresses Anxiety: Pulling attention away from the past or future and focusing it on the present can aid in achieving a higher state of mind. A simple way to practice mindfulness is to focus attention on the body from one end (i.e. the feet,) and notice the sensations as the attention is focused across the rest of the body to the other end (i.e. the head). Results: In the long run, self-awareness teaches people to manage and modify their thought processes in a healthy way."
176070158,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 155
176070159,It depends on the type of truth. People really battle over what they see as political truths. Everyone has the attitude - “But this is the truth!” I think that in that sort of thing there are many logical fallacies made by everybody.

174359845,"# Study finds evidence of neurobiological mechanism for hallucinations and delusions The researchers collected data from 127 patients with schizophrenia from various online databases and determined how an individual’s neural timescales related to their hallucination and delusion severities together. They found that neural timescales in the lower levels of the hierarchy tended to be longer in patients with more severe hallucinations, while neural timescales in the higher levels tended to be longer in patients with more severe delusions. These results provide the first direct evidence of a potential neurobiological mechanism for hallucinations and delusions that fits within the hierarchical model of psychosis and can explain their clinical presentation. The common neurobiological mechanism for both symptoms could result in increased neural timescales, but the symptom-specific pathways are the level of the hierarchy at which the neural timescales are increased."

174359853,Schizophrenia and it’s concerns are like surfing to me. You ride out the bad times and enjoy the good ones. It’s not uncommon to have setbacks. It’s just the way it is but if it continues outside normal you need to hook up with your doctor. You get old enough you learn what triggers you and what works so hang in there and let us know how your doing.
176070186,Which AP are you on now _AT_MENTION_? I’m looking for an alternative AP other than Risperdal and I can’t decide on any of them. Im diabetic and obese so I don’t think that Zyprexa would be a good match for me. I give up.
176070187,Eternal life if I obey the voices
176070188,"Ok than I still qualify for expanded medicaid and regular medicaid. So maybe my benefits will be less substantial if they rollback the ACA I’m not sure. Right now I qualify for prescriptions at no cost, no copays for psychiatrist visits which are right now over the phone, and I also am able to see a general doctor without copays. It has been a huger life-saver for me and cost-saver. I don’t have to pay for prescriptions because I can’t afford them. Also, the DHHR pretty much handles everything so I don’t have to do much but I think I may need to do a review. I really don’t want to lose the plan I have because it pays for everything. Even when hospitals still try to bill me for things I don’t owe."
176070189,hi. thanks for your friendship. i have a situation where certain people in my life are driving me towards anger and a whole lot of it. is there anything we can do considering we have an illness of sz? we should be able to get such people off of us due to dangers to health. _NAME_
176070190,So I’ve put off getting a scooter until this virus has passed as I don’t want to get the tube. I’m pleased to note electric scooters are getting the legal go ahead in the UK now.

176070192,What you have for a pancreas is what I have for lungs. Doctors have told me they don’t know how I’m alive and breathing unassisted. Best thing I can say about having a chronic condition is to play the long game. Imagine yourself overcoming the illness. People have used positive thinking alone to get rid of their cancer. You just can’t give up.

176070211,"Possible Names Hyperdopaminergic Disorder Chronic Psychosis Nondegenerative Dementia Psychophrenia Mental Illness 0 voters I was thinking that the name ‘schizophrenia’ is outdated, but I can understand how some people might be attached to it. I don’t like it because people call us ‘schizos’ but that probably wont go away right away if the name did change. Aside from the poll what names do you think would be good to replace ‘schizophrenia’ if there was a rebranding to create new and better understanding of the disease based on new and better understandings of the disease."
174359850,"_AT_MENTION_ Please get potassium from food instead of supplements. Bananas and potatoes and dates are rich in potassium. It’s hard to get the recommended daily intake because it’s set so high. You can also have too much potassium, which is rare. It’s best to stick to the daily recommendation, which is 4,700 of potassium. Bananas have about 4-500. Best having a banana and date smoothie. Eat more potatoes with the skin left on etc…etc. In the study they used potassium hydrochloride I think. I wouldn’t recommend supplements."

176070213,"It is possible to be genetically predisposed without having it from birth. Sometimes symptoms are only shown later because the brain develops unilt you’re 25. Sometimes, something triggers it that wouldn’t have triggered it if you weren’t predisposed. There’s plenty of us who have disproved your theory, yet you keep saying it’s impossible. Why is it so hard for you to believe you may have been predisposed? Why don’t you want to believe it? Why are you fighting this?"

Not much to do, just counting the days until my visit to VA in a week, election night the next week, and the arrival of my new Xbox the week after that. I phoned my grandparents today and chatted about politics and the cat we turned over to them when we moved. She’s doing well. They said they’ll pay my tuition if I choose to take a class next Spring, which I intend on doing. What kind of shows do you guys watch?"

176070230,"No matter who I speak to about my persecution from a sect of society that I am not allowed to name for legal reasons, nobody understands my persecution from them and the problems it has caused me. For many years I have been allocated only 12 hours in a day compared to the 24 that others get. This automatically renders a confused and dirty look from whoever you are talking to. I will try my best to explain how this works to people on this website to see if they have any similar persecutions caused by the people that I think some of you will be able to recognise. For every hour that other people experience, I only get half an hour. Every minute only lasts 30 seconds for me. By now people have already either become confused or have lost interest. My time continuum has been modified by these people. This has caused a horrendous snowball effect of problems. Not only am I forced by the NHS to take disgusting drugs that make me want to sleep all day, but the little hours left where I’m awake go twice as 
fast for me. This means that if I live to be 80 years of age, it would’ve only taken 40 years to reach that age for me. While I have no problem accepting the fact that I would be biologically 80 years old, it has only taken 40 to get there. It is similar to watching a YouTube video on 2x speed. Does anyone else suffer this persecution and does anybody have any advice as to how to stop it?"
