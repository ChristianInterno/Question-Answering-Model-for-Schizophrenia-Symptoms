176070265,"Like _AT_MENTION_ said, to prevent withdrawal, the trick to benzos is to cycle them. But if you’ve been on them too long that could be a problem. A person I knew in the psych ward went up to 8mg before he was put on an AD and an AP. Honestly, tapering helps tremendously but I believe cycling is the way to go. I skip my doses to prevent tolerance. Some days I take them, some days I don’t. I’m on 1.5 daily. Some days I take 1.5, some 1.0 and others 0.5. It all depends. But to get on topic and dealing with actual withdrawal, your best bet is rest. Try to sleep more, and try to prevent your body from getting stress. Try to limit your dopamine intake which can aggravate withdrawals. I think _AT_MENTION_ used L Theanine to wean off clonazepam, I’m not sure, correct me if I’m wrong."

176070290,"You should know the fact that; The hallucination induces an independent malicious transmission that start from the point at which the original transmitter path ends ! (the original transmitter is the dopamine as you think who carried the informational message from the self transmission center ) The hallucination begins to emit a malicious cognitive message (vocally) when the path of the self transmission ends in the receptor cells,during that the conscious mind of the person perceives the meaning of the self cognitive message and gives his rationality view It means that,the hallucination entity reads the self cognitive message which received now by the receptor cells ,specially after the conscious mind of the person has an understanding of its implicit meaning,immediately after that moment The hallucination’s transmission consist of 3 effects as following ; a moved imaginary image (s),and audible vocal message that ends with a reinforced feeling (but we speak only about the audible vocal message 
) ,all in one package (image,voice and feeling) We want to explain that,there is no defect in the material of the original neurotransmitters,nor in the original transmission path,nor even in the way the receptor cells receive the self cognitive message of any transmitter NOR in the rationality of the conscious mind of the person all of these have not a role in the malicious transmission of hallucination ! Just an parasitical transmission occur after the receptor cells receive the self transmitter message When the hallucination issues the vocal malicious message in the conscious mind of the person THE question; Are hallucination using the original transmitter (like dopamine) in its vocal transmission ? Purpose,for the sake of argument, that the hallucination uses the dopamine in its transmission ! Without slightest doubt,there are radical differences between the self cognitive message (soundless) and malicious cognitive message (audible vocal ) that be sent by the mutational factor (hallucination) the most imp
ortant difference,the amount of neural energy that is draining / released to create the effort required to transmit the malicious vocal message from its starting point to the end of its path is much than the energy amount needed to transmit a signal of cognitive message throughout the brain cells ! The problem in the amount of neural energy that the person loses during the process of listening (receiving) the malicious cognitive message of the hallucination,it is much greater that the energy that transfers the original transmitter from the transmission center to the receptor cells In other words the issue is not an increase in the secretion of dopamine,but rather a sudden increase in the amount of neural energy that is released and drains during and after receiving the malicious cognitive message that is induced by the hallucination (the mutational factor )"

176070306,"Yes stopping antipsychotics cold turkey can cause withdrawal symptoms and other effects. When I stopped the Invega Sustenna injection, i was unable to sleep at all, after 2 to 3 weeks I had a really bad psychosis like episode. It was paranoia intensified. Not only did I hear the worst most realistic sounding external auditory hallucinations, I also was terrified they would kill me and my family. It got so bad that I was laying on the floor not moving for fear they’d get me. Other times I’ve stopped cold turkey, I get hypomanic. Feeling on top of the world until I come crashing down. In a side note, I’ve always found it interesting to hear that antipsychotics DO affect people without a mental illness.when used. Prescription meds can have adverse effects if misusing prescription pills whether not following recommended dosage or using prescription meds not prescribed to them. At this point, it would be like crying over spilled milk. Once diagnosed there is no going back unless a person is employ
ed and stable for several years off medication, then MAYBE a psychiatrist would evaluate them as recovered. That being said, I’m not against treatment, it is there to help and is still being improved. I also wouldn’t recommend blaming the antipsychotics for being ill. More often than not people were initially put on antipsychotics for a reason. I know the mind sometimes tries to rationalize things but speaking from personal experience, paranoia can get a person placed on antipsychotics if there is extreme paranoia. I was witness to a murder. I didn’t go to the authorities. I thought the people might try to murder me. It is plausible in theory. Yet that does not matter anymore. Now I’ve been on meds and have tried life without them, on meds I’m generally stable, off meds I feel stable and appear to be so until enough time has passed then I exhibit symptoms and worsen over time. My psychiatrist gave me a chance to try life without meds. I failed after 18 months. I almost want to kick myself for that. 
I’ve come to realize there is no shame in taking meds or seeking help for an illness. I find some comfort in those words."

He also says that I should just get used to doing things without feeling motivation or enjoyment and that eventually the feeling may come back.

The occurrence of negative voice content directly about appearance is therefore plausible. Derogatory comments about appearance are likely to be distressing, increase depression and contribute to social withdrawal.To systematically assess the occurrence of voice content regarding appearance and identify correlates.Sixty patients experiencing verbal auditory hallucinations at least once a week in the context of non-affective psychosis completed a measure assessing positive and negative voice content about appearance. They also completed assessments about body image, self-esteem, psychiatric symptoms and well-being.Fifty-f
ive (91.7%) participants reported hearing voices comment on their appearance. A total of 54 (90%) patients reported negative voice content about their appearance with 30 (50%) patients experienced negative appearance comments on a daily basis. The most common negative comment was 'the voices tell me that I am ugly' (n = 48, 80%). There were 39 (65%) patients who reported positive voice content on appearance. The most frequent positive comment was 'I look as nice as other people' (n = 26, 43.3%). Negative voice content about appearance was associated with body image concerns, paranoia, voice hearing severity, depression, worry, negative self-beliefs and safety-seeking behaviours. Positive appearance voice content was associated with greater body esteem and well-being and lower levels of depression and insomnia.Voice content about appearance is very common for patients seen in clinical services.

I just couldn’t place it although I had heard it many times on t.v. and in film. I asked the women I was with if they recognized it and they said they did not. After confession was over, I went over to where the priest was getting ready and I told him directly that he had a beautiful accent and I asked him where he was from. To my complete surprise, and embarrassment, he said in a perfect Midwestern accent that he was from eastern Nebraska. (The same part of the country where I was from!) I thanked him and went back to my pew. How embarrassing! He delivered his homily and the rest of the Mass in a perfect Midwestern accent. I could have sworn he had a very pronounced foreign accent in the confessional. On the drive home from the Church, I was getting the feeling that the other three women in the car felt that I was headed for Hell and not part of their group. That they 
thought they were better than me spiritually and that I didn’t belong to their little group. Later that evening, my friend on the phone, asked me how I knew all of that. I told her that I just “knew”. She told me, “So, you are reading their minds are you?” I said, “yeah”."

led to a life of suffering for me; and its artificial narrative which seeks to undermine the creative soul and genuine diversity of every human individual.

So, it was impossible to have a conversation or listen to someone else speak. I couldn’t watch television because of the voices and lack of focus. Lack of focus is probably tied with voices, actually. I couldn’t hardly do anything because of my lack of focus. Everything overwhelmed me. I was so suicidal because there was nothing I could do but sit and stare at the wall."
176070589,There isn’t one close to me at all so I have never been. It would be a four hour drive.
176070590,Ya it’s easy when you got a pack but when you get home and don’t have any the addiction kicks in. Good luck maybe cut back and not go cold turkey I have this trouble with chew
176070591,looks really good
176070592,you are really out of it right now…not in touch with reality at all…I used to think the whole world watched me too…in a different way though…but I was sick…you need a med change stat.
176070593,"Thanks _PERSON_ ,"
176070594,"I feel like this too, and one of the worst parts about mental health in general is believing you’re making it up or worrying that you’re faking. From the outside looking in, and I dont say this to be mean, this post sounds like you are not a fraud. It doesnt come off as being from a healthy and stable point of view, but more of an anxious and scared point of view. I get like this too sometimes. I told my psychiatrist that it is all in my head, and she said “well where else would it be, your toe?” That gave me some perspective that it is all in my head but I’m also not making it up. It’s a mental illness, and disregarding new evidence of gut bacteria, it is a chemical imbalance in the brain, which just so happens to be in your head. Is there anything you can do to try to relax?"
176070595,Congrats _AT_MENTION_ . I’m sticking with the multivitamin. Although it’s not helping with anxiety.
176070596,"No, I wouldn’t call it dysfunctional. There were some issues and I was sexually abused in the (extended) family. But overall there was also lots of love, care, structure and more such things that kids need."
176070597,"um, no way. The hospital was pretty awful. I cope better at home, anyways, with the ability to watch TV, listen to music, pace around, drink coffee – home comforts, ya know. Didn’t have any of that in the hospital."
176070598,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . I’ve got a lot to think on and the crowd is picking on me. Maybe I’ll try calling my Pdoc

174359939,So did you recover?
176070600,"Thats awesome. Glad to hear your recovering! I used some psychoanalysis as welll. It helped deconstruct a lot of things, like you said decode. Ive gotten to that point recently too, where I am slowly gaining back the passion for living and optimism for the future. cheers"
174359940,I’m on abilify only And my prolactin is still above normal But not by a lot
176070601,Can’t the Dr prescribe you something for that?
176070602,Thanks everyone I talked to my therapist today and I’ve decided to just stick with what I know. I’m sorry but they are all the same to me. I’ve given up on them.

That’s just so bad on my part I know, but that’s what I was thinking way back when all this MS stuff was going on. Now I’m a bit more relaxed on the MS, but there are days I believe I have it, like today because I just never woke up today, that happens a lot for me, I never feel refreshed when I wake up. I have sleep apeona and use CPAP. I have to trust my psychiatrist now. Am taking a lot of meds, so could have side effects also. Dont know. Since starting zyprexa I feel more motivated but that’s not to say it wont lift my mood? My mood is very flat. I hate it. I wish my mood lifted."
176070609,I have some honeycomb in the cabinet. Maybe that will please my sweet tooth
176070610,Hahaha this is so true. I’ve been trying “intuitive” eating as well I like that term. It seems so easy like I just have to not eat junk then I’ll be fine. I have had no success with dieting lately not even calorie counting. I have been getting such strong cravings and when I count my calories it’s like I’m just starving all day and am even worse at controlling the cravings. I wonder if it has anything to do with my IUD. Since I’ve started actively trying to lose weight I have actually gained 3 lbs.

I wonder if I should just be patient and accept that I’ll have hellish moments still… You’ve been through suffering also despite the meds but you got better one day maybe? My mind was sick for too long in fact, maybe that’s why I have this body suffering too now… I was scared today because of it… I couldn’t even move and it was very, very painful… my doc said something like that its psychological in my case, but I am not sure… I ended up by taking a benzo… This zyprexa have an interest to blow out nicely my head for once… Yeah, I shouldn’t be tempted to stop it, my doc said I’ll worsen without it… now Iight, ot as it was before - a total despair, but now my body doesnt follow still, idk what is this… this can get better too one day, isn’t it?

So I saw these luminette glasses on amazon, there was a 30 day return policy so I figured what the heck Ill try these first and if they help then ill just keep them, if not ill send them back. Im a pretty skeptical person, I have tried every supplement/vitamins etc under the sun and have minimal faith in supplements, so the light therapy thing I had similar doubts, especially glasses, but I noticed they worked pretty quickly I was pretty surprised.

I gamble on kickstarters and have way more fun enjoying YEARS of gaming developments and interesting additions to a source of entertainment that has helped me through so many things, and its so much more valuable then a bunch of flickering blinking lights and a buffet. Screw casinos the real rush is making a game company a success and then enjoying the fruits of their labor. Right now I have backed companies that have been picked up by Microsoft to become serious in house studios and I am absolutely delighted by my light impact on the media.

But the girl didn’t get it and stood there looking at me with a bewildered look on her face. I repeated myself and her face didn’t change. I said, “It’s a joke.” Whooosh! Right over her head. I’m sorry but that joke was hilarious and it deserved a laugh. I know my jokes are too sophisticated for most people but I took that as a grave insult and from now on I’m boycotting all Taco Bells."

174359969,"You’re welcome! I hope you find the answers you want. I’ll put some abstracts of scitific articles I found in ResearchGate: Neuroleptic induced deficit syndrome: Increasing interest in subjective aspects of therapy and rehabilitation focused the attention of psychiatrists, psychologists and psychopharmacologists on the mental side effects of neuroleptics. For the drug-related impairment of affective, cognitive and social function the name of neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome (NIDS) is proposed. Patients with NIDS appear to be indifferent to the environmental stimuli, retarded and apathetic. They complain of feeling drugged and drowsy, weird, they suffer from lack of motivation, feel like “zombies”. The paper presents description of NIDS and its differentiation from negative and depressive symptoms in schizophrenia and subjective perceiving of extrapyramidal syndromes. Neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome in bipolar disorder with psychosis Neuroleptics can induce not only physical adverse 
effects but also mental effects that produce deficit status in thought, affect, cognition, and behavior. This condition is known as neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome (NIDS), which includes apathy, lack of initiative, anhedonia, indifference, blunted affect, and reduced insight into disease. Although this old concept now appears almost forgotten, neuroleptics, whether typical or atypical, can make depression or bipolar disorder resemble other more refractory conditions, readily leading to mistaken diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The authors describe three cases of NIDS superimposed on depressive phase in bipolar disorder with psychosis, where the attending psychiatrist’s failure to recognize NIDS prevented patients from receiving effective treatment and achieving remission. All cases achieved remission after reduction of neuroleptics and intensive therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy, for bipolar depression. The concept of NIDS was originally introduced for schizophrenia, and it has rarely 
been highlighted in other diseases. In recent years, however, atypical antipsychotics are being more often administered to patients with bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists, therefore, should also remember and exercise caution regarding NIDS in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder with and without psychosis. The authors believe that the concept of NIDS needs to be reappraised in current psychiatry. Neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome. Historical introduction The treatment of psychotic illness has long been inextricably associated with society’s view in general on social deviance. In medieval times, psychotic individuals were contained within the community, a situation which still prevails in many developing countries. Aggregation of such patients in asylums followed the increasing industrialization of communities in the nineteenth century, when the ability of the disadvantaged of all kinds to survive was greatly jeopardized. The twentieth century has seen a gradual reversal of this process, as attitudes tow
ards mentally ill people have become a little more enlightened and liberal. However, the swing against the great lunatic asylums of the last century has proceeded at such an administrative rate that our patients are again in danger of succumbing medically and economically within our communities. It is common to see desperately poor and damaged psychotic individuals on our streets. The advent of neuroleptics was a major factor in the change from a custodial to an ostensibly rehabilitative approach in the treatment of schizophrenia. However, classic neuroleptics have a long list of well-recognized side effects such as affective and cognitive impairment that lead to poor treatment compliance, psychiatric relapse and social decompensation, the state of affairs of our street psychotics. Treatments that lessen the probability of this unfortunate process are desperately needed. The introduction of new neuroleptic drugs with favourable side effect profiles is to be welcomed as a major step in increasing the quality o
f life of our patients, both in hospital and functioning in the community."
176070706,I feel like it does. A little bit each time.
174359970,Take another antipsychotic like abilify or amisulpride and wait for results first
176070707,Yes. I would be so scared if I ever get pulled over. What can I do but avoid them. As long as I behave myself they have no reason to stick their nose in my business. The arrested me when I blacked out and should have taken me to a hospital but took me to jail instead.

They are not voices in the sense that they are external from another person, I know they are in my brain. They don’t have the depth of another human voice, more the subtly of a thought, only more distinctive somehow. I usually whisper or talk them out loud without knowing, but without that they surly are not voices."

176070715,Are you still on meds?
176070716,The thing is I had a real hard time cutting the tiny 1mg tablets in half when I was taking 3.5 milligrams. I’ll ask my doctor for 0.5mg tablets if I decide to go back on a 3.5mg dose.
176070717,"good luck _AT_MENTION_. I think you have more experience on meds than drs themselves. there’s no perfect drug but definitely one that has the fewest negatives is preferred. i suppose i got lucky, zyprexa has been golden despite the 50 lb increase."

176070745,"Hi Does anyone on this forum relate to having no feelings or emotions towards others? I’m feeling this now for about two years. I was never like this until I became ill. No feelings or interest or enjoyment from anything. I wonder why I’m so disconnected? It’s not getting better even with all the meds I’m taking. I’m worried I’ll never feel emotion again. I’m just dead flat mood wise every day for the last two/three years. I wonder if it’s the depression or something else. I dont have schizophrenia. Do any of you feel this way with schizophrenia? Maybe I’m developing schizophrenia or something I dont know. It seems odd to me that I am taking two antipsychotics for somataform disorder that’s all. I’m confused about it all. What is causing this awful flatness and no feelings is troubling me. My pdoc may increase the zyprexa when I see her next. She said lithium is very good for depression if the zyprexa doesn’t lift my mood. Bloods have to be good though to start on lithium. I

My friend says I’d be good at it. The #1 broadcasting school in the country is 10-15 min from me. Maybe I can do a tour. I dunno. I’m always saying I’m gonna do something but don’t.

It’s not just me that has had difficulty with having a prior mental illness and getting health professionals to entertain the possibility that there is something additional going on . There needs to better standards as to recognising and supporting those who have a combination of ASD and a severe mental illness . In my case as explained above it wasn’t about having good coping skills. I do know though that a lot of people on the spectrum mask their symptoms ."

174360009,I believe it dissent but it only counts as an condition of the doctors decide to make it one. The thing is that for my case I believe I had as before I ever had any sort of any medical symptoms starting 2016 when I graduated high school.

174360004,The game is stop following hallucinations and getting cues from ideas of reference. Fight for the common uncorrupted reality you were living in before schizophrenia. Following hallucinations and ideas of reference is the path to an early end.
176070816,The scary thing for me was realising it wasn’t true. I.e. when I started becoming sane again. The best thing you can do is report this to your psychiatrist and also tell them that it’s a bit frightening. We’re at the mercy of our meds really. If they’re not working we either need to increase the dose or change them via our psychiatrist. Keep fighting the disease.
176070817,I got to take care other wise the voices give me physical symptoms that don’t go easy on my body. Like getting gout or colesterol

176070856,I’d say a good portion of schizophrenics have thoughts of wanting to die at times. This disease is a burden on us and those around us and sometimes we schizophrenics feel it’s best to let it all end. But usually we schizophrenics will throw the thought of suicide into the back burner and continue with our daily lives. It’s all much better when we live than when we die. Compare ourselves to 3rd world countries who are not as fortunate as ourselves living with the amenities our 1st world country provides.

Neurocognition is the ability to receive and remember information, and includes verbal fluency, memory, reasoning, problem solving, speed of processing, and auditory and visual perception” en.wikipedia.org Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis.

174360021,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Association of Choroid Plexus Enlargement With Cognitive, Inflammatory, and Structural Phenotypes Across the Psychosis Spectrum. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, AM _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The American journal of psychiatry , Jun 2019 05 The choroid plexus is an important physiological barrier and produces CSF and neurotrophic, angiogenic, and inflammatory factors involved in brain development. Choroid plexus abnormalities have been implicated in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A previous choroid plexus transcriptomic analysis of schizophrenia identified an upregulation of immune and inflammatory genes that correlated with peripheral inflammatory markers. The purpose of this study was to examine choroid plexus volume in probands across the psychosis spectrum and in their first-degree and axis II cluster A relatives, as well as choroid plexus familiality and choroid plexus covariance with clin
ical, cognitive, brain, and peripheral marker measures.Choroid plexus volume was quantified (using FreeSurfer) in psychosis probands, their first-degree and axis II cluster A relatives, and healthy control subjects, organized by DSM-IV-TR diagnosis. Analyte, structural connectivity, and genotype data were collected from a subset of study subjects.Choroid plexus volume was significantly larger in probands compared with first-degree relatives or healthy control subjects; first-degree relatives had intermediate enlargement compared with healthy control subjects; and total choroid plexus volume was significantly heritable. Larger volume was associated with worse cognition, smaller total gray matter and _USER_ID_ volume, larger lateral ventricle volume, and lower structural connectivity in probands. Associations between larger volume and higher levels of interleukin 6 in probands was also observed.These findings suggest the involvement of the choroid plexus across the psychosis spectrum with a potential pathophysi
ological mechanism involving the neuroimmune axis, which functions in maintaining brain homeostasis and interacting with the peripheral immune and inflammatory system. The choroid plexus may be an important target in future research."

I wanted it to storm, metaphorically like cause chaos because i thought i was battling the magical stalkers stalking me. Well some strange things happened afterwards, but i had some weird belief that i ushered in the pandemic.

I want a situation in which I would not get psychiatric drugs because they may have negative impact on skills associated with driving a car. I started to get medications before 18th birthday and never tried to drive a car. I am above 27,5 years old and live in a small locality where finding a job can be problematic. I am unemployed yet (but not officially registered as such) and have social pension (Polish: renta socjalna, it is about 940 PLN (circa 230$) I do not know if I will have prolongation of it) and care allowance (Polish: zasi?ek piel?gnacyjny, it is about 200 PLN (circa 50$)). Coincidences are pleasant for me, they certainly are not OCD symptoms, which are unpleasant. When I saw Big Hole encounter, in left down part of the monitor quite often appeared two letters which are chemical symbol of element (on which first letter is large, but in the game both letters were small) which four first letters mean rude word for buttocks or anus in 
British English and doubled second letters forms impolite word for these parts of body in American English. Before seeing Big Hole encounter, I had during my former job (maybe in September 2018) fantasies about “Big A**” (Polish: “Wielka D**a”) special encounter in very similar game to that game with Big Hole. The “big hole” from game encounter was a reference to anus of nitrogen-based alien form life in “Evolution” movie from 2001."

The rhythms are all from the heart once you get the technical skills down. I love it because you manipulate the sound with your tongue, cheeks, lips, and diaphragm. It requires a good deal of concentration to play well. Muscle memory is very important. The NaF has a sonorous quality that also comes from the heart and it’s very easy to pick up so virtually anyone can play well if you stick to the diatonic scale."

174360054,"For me, I was really on ice for several years, after getting sick ‘15, when I was just diagnosed and on medication, I believe it may have been post psychotic depression for me, though I also felt the bare effects of a limited drive to persist, think, speak, or feel pleasure. For me alogia, or poverty of speech, was one of the most persistent and frustrating aspects, and now I no longer deal with that issue. It took 3 and a half years, and it was a struggle you can’t find parallels for I took very high doses of several antipsychotics at a time as I was always symptomatic. It is a hard time to go back to, but it was gradually thawing. My doctor tapered me off quetiapine, though I currently take quetiapine 125mg. He is tapering me off it again as I have some tardive dyskinesia. I was on, 4 antidepressants, trintellix, prozac, luvox and zoloft, and they weren’t helping at all for negative symptoms now I take lamotrigine and it has had a pronounced effect…mostly I think because I am schizoaffect
ive, so my negative symptoms, and the high antipsychotic doses, were connected to depression. The very high doses I took for years were helpful in preserving and healing my brain from the psychotic episode. For me, quetiapine is the absolute best, through trial and error, as it is light, and my brain has become accustomed to it, and it recognizes and uses it more effectively, leading me to feel very lucid. Antipsychotics are antidepressants too, but depression, I think, can be the seat of symptoms which may feel paralyzing, as were the symptoms I experienced. I wasn’t depressed, but I couldn’t feel pleasure or even happiness, and it seems the missing aspect was lamictal, because, I think, it doesn’t work if you don’t have a mood disorder. I am convinced I have had mood symptoms as an aspect of my personality since early childhood. So, quetiapine and lamotrigine."

174360051,"“I cannot grasp, hold. This inescapable anguish. There is so much noise, too much complexity, it makes no sense at all! Must we avoid in order to survive, despite how large it grows and harder to avoid daily? Is there respite to this suffocating pressure?” She gesticulates, having no words for the inexpressible. Still, he hears her, the one who sailed these boundless seas for eons. Every passing surge the condition worsens. Now the harsh cold and sheer isolation no longer pains him as it first had, through his thickening skin and hardening coat, adapting to this ever pervasive desolation. So truly lost. Seeing no end to this infinite stretch, nor answers that ever holds. Yet he continues to remark a heading, rereads the winds, listens to its last breath, journalling it all—the last delve—in the off chance the leathered records may be picked up by those who too descends into this barren world. Despite the hardship, despite the many curses of the unreal without order, some scent of his humani
ty still remains. He will call out into the void—seeing nothing but phantoms within the haze—assuming there is, on the other side, another soul to hear him. Perhaps to gain the wisdom of the within, and share the light. O’ how terribly perturbing and disturbing the chaos be. The depths reveals to one, in the most merciless way, how fragile this space we call our home. What a wondrous bliss would it would be to feel thy body rest on the long grass and see the night’s sky once more! But do not shirk and evade; stand tall in the face of the absurd and senseless, laugh in its unduly reign. For thou has no say in this. Repelling the exacerbating inexorable will only further the torment. So know its place, embody a living conviction above all convictions. For once one tackles it, even for a moment, head on to the turmoiled sea—the tempest noise—no longer it induces the looming fear, the great unknown, no longer it pressingly calls for the explanatory elaborations. “Thy calls reverberate from the depth
s itself, and sheds light on those phantoms falling with—close yet permanently detached, in a way only the abyss can manifest. These layers are so full of terrible curses, I wish to find a blind and cease this deserted being.” Thy castle has collapsed and crumbling. No more solid walls, nowhere to hunker down safe from the weather. It’s only nature to try and recreate those old conditions of stability. Those fragmenting pieces are, perhaps not a friend, but a lesser evil. You do not have the capacity to rebuilt back what was, from so little pieces and so little strength, any attempts will risk a crooked structure far from safe. The ancient works were held up by the forces from beyond, for which you do not have a say in. Thus, in the desperation, any cover will seem to do, just to keep out the torrential rains and tempest winds. But the abyssal cannot hurt however, not directly. Stand there and breathe, to see that you’re chilled but not freezing, your vision clouded in the haze yet not blind. There ma
y even be a smallest joy in the desolation. Whereas the structures can kill, can hurt; it only takes one blow to send it falling, trapping you within. Never had this chasm opened a communication so well! For many, I still tell stories of the depths, for they are not even conscious of their own shattering castles. In their terrified distress, they’d run for the covers. But you, entrenched within this inexplicable growing agony, are beginning to sense the fields of this realm—the ever pervasive tension—and own wishes to refind a place to call your own. “I hear your stories! You have lent me a warm but hard light, some sort of further way to see the world that was—is—dim to me; present yet laborious, and all too easy to let thine eyes close to. Alone, I would wander off a cliff, searching for fragments to restore my castle; and for that there’ll never be a gratitude nor appreciation enough that can be given.” ——— Some words regarding the schizophrenic experience of “unreality” and delus

I went to Goodwill this week and spent $120 on new-to-me clothing in sizes 16 and 14 (I’m in an 18 now) and regular XL. Everything was $3.99 and the blue tagged items were half off that! I got three HUGE bags of clothing and am basically set for when I change sizes again. I am glad to find so much in my next sizes. I have been spending about $350-400 on new clothes at each size and I have had four size changes. That’s not so sustainable. I feel guilty when I donate something I’ve only worn for two or three months, but at $3.99 a pi
ece, I won’t have to feel guilty to donate that stuff. I also went back yesterday and bought one pair of size 12 pants and four size large tops to make outfits for my long-term goal weight. Those 12s look SO SMALL! But if I’m an 18 at 217, I may just be able to get into those 12s at 150-160! Incentive! There is another Goodwill about ten miles away.

My current psych doc gave me Straterra and said I can only have adderall if I do a ADHD test from a specialist and I turned it down because of my caffeine addiction. So no adderall here. I don’t really want it but it might help me because I might have the inattentive type."

I’ve never been to a university, but took just a couple classes at a time at a local community college for 5 years when I lived in the board & care. Still working on my degree but only taking online classes. Going to college was a good experience. I took a lot of Physical _NAME_ courses like weight training, volleyball, tennis. Some people liked me, I talked to certain people. I have to say though, no one really bothered me, none of that high school crap went on, for the most part."

Basically, while I’m living the poor life and living with schizophrenia, people are charging $800+ for one of my books (be fair I didn’t publish it). Then you have these lawyers in Flordia lying and making ???? up. You have stalkers and harassers. You have movies, cultural/media references (even an Anime in Japan), You have some ??????? who tried to make a patent off the time travel machine, etc. I would like some money, but I rather be safe and avoid all the controversy. I live in fear most times. It’s definitely possible I’m not him, but I have the delusions and memory. Time will tell for sure. Maybe in a couple to a few years. I concede that I may not be him, yet it’s an elaborate constructed fantasy I came up with to fill in the emptiness in my life."

Men and women exhibit different rates of incidence and prevalence, age at onset, symptom expression, course of illness, and response to treatment.

So _NAME_ swore to be honest for the rest of his days. They both became garbagemen in America and here’s how their lives go at 50. _NAME_: Hey _NAME_ I’ve got a date tonight. My dating profile is really getting hits. _NAME_: Yeah well you have a 20 year old photo of yourself and say you make a ton more money than you do, lied about your age, and your intentions. Of course you did. _NAME_: Yeah and you were honest and no one has called. That’s why your lonely tonight. _NAME_: And by the way _NAME_ I’m amazed that even though taxes were lowered I’m paying more. _NAME_: Well I’m not. _NAME_: _NAME_ you’re such a liar. _NAME_: And _NAME_ your such a loser.

174360075,"Myn case was pretty severe in the beginning. A couple years of constant psychosis, I really couldn’t function. Hospitals, group homes, seeing shrinks. I went the whole route. And my symptoms were bad throughout the entire '80’s. In the nineties my symptoms were still there but I actually functioned pretty highly and worked and attended college. Had a good friend who I hung out with, and attended 5 or 6 AA, CA, and NA meetings a week. What I’m getting to is that I’m 59 now and though some symptoms and delusions have lessened and grown less intense and disabling, I am not as sharp as I used to be. But hey, I got a B in my last online college class. I drive all over in an area notorious for it’s bad traffic. I work part-time and live pretty much on my own. I take care of my own finances and while there’s room for improvement, I don’t do badly. My cognitive functions may not be as good as they used to but hey, I’m out here functioning pretty good. (and life don’t end when you’re nea
ring sixty, lol). If my social life ain’t the best, it’s because of choices I made, not schizophrenia. I am not “cured” or “recovered”, I believe it’s an ongoing process that even though I do OK in lots of areas, the schizophrenia often makes my daily life, “one step up, and two steps back”. I don’t like it, but I don’t have to like it, it’s a just an unfortunate reality. I haven’t given up by a long shot."

174360085,"I take Niacin 500mg per day and highly recommend it. I’ve also noticed more about my condition, there is a behavioral consideration to consider with schizophrenia, so I’ve dealt with any bad habits, which weren’t so prevalent before I was diagnosed. Now I feel less nervous and have more motivation. I also take folic acid, this is very good for schizophrenia and following a blood test last year it was discovered I had a deficiency. It is also a B-vitamin. I also take Omega-3 oil pills and used to take magnesium until I ran out of pills, need to order some more. Anyway, I take Niacinamide which is the no flush Niacin, yet is also very good for dealing with schizophrenia. I have taken it for 7 months and beginning to see the benefits to taking it. For those of us with chronic schizophrenia, it is recommended to take Niacin for longer, in order to have a [positive] effect. There is a good article on a website called “Food for the Brain” which explains that in the tests done with Niacin for sc
hizophrenia, the only reason why the follow-up trials don’t show as much promise as Dr. _PERSON_’s original is because the Niacin was used with people that have chronic schizophrenia, so it would have taken more time to see a benefit. I have no problem with this, people in the acute phase of schizophrenia that are experiencing it for the first time that are treated see the most benefit, but Niacin (or Niacinamide) is very good for schizophrenia. I also found that there was an interaction with the medication, but I don’t dare to go back to taking purely drugs, my paranoia and delusions were bad when I wasn’t taking Niacinamide."

176071140,"Hello. I don’t know the exact statistics, but yes some schizophrenics do report much more mild symptoms as they age. I’m very thankful that’s the case for me. In my late twenties when I was first diagnosed I could barely function. Now I live on my own and have a much better quality of life."
174360088,"I’m sorry to hear that. Maybe you should tell your attorneys that if they want to keep their reputation as good attorneys they’d better take your case more seriously. Just a thought. I enrolled in paralegal school once. I didn’t have a car, and I didn’t have a computer, so I knew very little about word processing. I do read very well, though. If I could have put that across to some attorney I might have become a valued employee of a law firm. I could have written legal briefs all day. But my schizophrenic brain always sabotages me. If they found out I was a sz I probably would have been immediately sacked."

176071146,"Not at all! It doesn’t matter what you end up in the hospital for. For example, I was in various units because I was having seizures, lowered stomach function, heart problems, chest pain, etc. The list goes on. Even with physical illness, there’s always a shame attached: shame for being sick, simply. But if you are going to die…you need to get there! I also mean this emotionally. If you feel like you are completely perishing inside, you need to go. Brain is an organ. Thanks to my doctors who saved me from an 8-hour-long series of seizures, I survived that night. But, if I didn’t go to the emerge because of how “shameful” my illness was, I wouldn’t be here today. My point is, it’s not shameful at all. It’s often needed."
176071147,??? What move is that?..……
174360096,I used to handle stress pretty well before sz. Now I get stressed just from selling items online or anything even easy. I remember this started a few years before my diagnosis during studying and exams in college and then university. Does schizophrenia reduces our ability to fight stress?
176071148,It helps a lot but meds are still the primary choice for psychotics. As an adjunct treatment I believe exercise to be better than supplements.

port… One of my goals in my current day treatment program is to increase the amount of meaningful activities I have.

176071203,"The best part is being all fired up to quit. All the promises become fullfilled and i feel being on the top of the world, and than, like a worm, I get secound thoughts and that kills the whole idea. I think i got trust issues. Like the voices telling me, “trust me, you go to hell”"

Then we put up Christmas lights outside on her porch which was a little difficult as they kept getting tangled. But we did it. Success. A good way to spend the afternoon.

176071219,I’ve found benzo’s for being good to get you to sleep and not so good for prolonged sleep. We are all a bit different but putting it under your tongue and letting it dissolve should let it hit your bloodstream quicker. IT’s good for anxiety like that. Trouble with using it as a sleeper is that they can be addictive and you build up tolerance.

176071252,"Well done, you. Keep pushing yourself mate, this is progress."
174360138,"It’s not sz combined with a mood disorder. That’s just the diagnostic criteria, which are particularly stringent with sza because the diagnosis itself is so questionable. Stringent criteria increase the reliability, making the diagnosis appear more valid. Conceptually, sza is a diagnosis that lies between sz and bipolar I disorder or between sz and unipolar depressions. It’s always been conceived of as less severe than sz, but more severe than a regular mood disorder, and the relevant scientific evidence confirms this assumption. However, sza is often grouped with sz in research on psychosis, as they are very similar, and obviously, many cases are actually more severe than your ‘average’ schizophrenia. Mood symptoms are also a positive prognostic factor in regular sz, and is correlated with a less severe outcome."

Same folks do take metformin for high blood sugar or blood pressure meds because those meds won’t make them feel much worse from the quality of life standpoint. I hope lumateperone will get approved.

Or about not being able to find a job we can do. What I currently think the main problem is: The idea that people don’t like us. It is suspicion or, worse, paranoia. It is the frequent thought that people don’t like us. I know I have a lot of problems socially. I am primitive in that way. Also related to this is that sometimes I don’t like them. Foir little reasons, I guess. My social style is a party of one. Also I need to learn to talk better. To stay on topic. To be interested in others. To have a little wit and humor. To meet people. To be able to think while I am talking. Savour-faire."

Well, I’m always worried about home intruders, but I’ve been obsessing about it since my last rough patch just over a month ago.

Many of us deal with varying schizophrenia symptoms, of varying degrees, and I can’t say anyone truly just knows how to handle it.

I’m sorry things are getting hard again. Please don’t give up, and fight those detrimental urges! Don’t be afraid to ask for the help you need! It’s probably gonna be really uncomfortable at first. But it’s worth it. While I may not have advice, reading your post just helped me feel a lot more confident in what we can do despite what we go through. Thank you again, and I know you can figure things out!"

I’d still eat meat from animals that were hunted. And eggs, and fish. I also kill insects if they’re annoying. I’m not going to spend 5 minutes and 100 times more calories than that insect will ever need to save it. That’s also moral confusion."

176071301,"On one end, you have marginalized people like women, LGBT folks, the handicapped. On the opposite end are the people who outright bully and hate those people. Somewhere in the middle are the people who laugh at them in the name of comedy. I know a lot of folks want to live in the past with regards to what kind of comedy is acceptable. However we’re a lot more sensitive to marginalized groups now and have to take into account that comedy at the expense of others can be damaging. I’m sure there’s a compromise here. I personally just ignore jokes I find offensive, I have to, the world is just too full of people who make people like me the butt of their jokes. It still hurts though… for example, every time a famous comedian uses the three letter F word (homophobic slur) on stage I die a little bit inside. And it’s more common than you think, _NAME_ has said it a lot and I’ve even heard _PERSON_ say it on stage. Not targeting you specifically, I am not really familiar with your humor, just s

176071343,"I don’t know what demiurge is or that gnostic/religious/philosophical stuff is but I think we live in a brain in a vat. I don’t recall or probably never figured out how it worked. I researched or googled a lot of things including ‘boltzman brain’ and stuff. Lately, I think _PERSON_ brain isn’t true in my case anymore. I thought about SIMs and matrix mainly. I think about infinite dimensions or Hilbert Space(s) which in the latter case I know nothing about. Personally, I had sensations or memories of being outside this reality and interacting with people and being a part of the creative process. I don’t know if that’s what an alien or Christian does or not. I definitely met aliens and met the entities that run this simulation. I’m sort of confused really. I cannot remember now but maybe 10 years from now I’ll have a clearer, better understanding and can talk about it in more depth and detail. Like I realized I’ve been physically in other realities. No joke. I have. But my conscio
usness moves around at night and during reincarnation process. It’s both in my case. I recall stuff and think I’m psychic. I’m sure some mis-remembering is possible or incorrect stuff is coming out sometimes, but I don’t know. I never claimed to be God or Jesus or totally spot on about everything. Personally, I think dimensions could go theoretically infinite but that’s God stuff/Hilbert Space stuff. Sort of like unknown or different physics or music. Then you got m theory/string theory and 11/12 dimensions max create a stable universe as far as we know. So I thought I escaped the simulation, went to heaven, hell, and the 5th dimension, and parallel universes, other planets, and stuff. I experienced a lot of that and more. Practically everything. A lot can happen in eternity, pretty much. I’m sure black holes and black hole physics is involved. I haven’t written my thoughts down in a succinct manner recently and tied all the ends. But we may never know the truth. It may be isomorphic. It may not 
be a simulation at all just like scientists think they know everything when they could be wrong. Some aliens like simulations, some dont. It could be a control thing. It could be a spiritual/religious warfare sort of thing and power thing. I don’t know. Maybe they are protecting us from self-destruction and God is protecting us. Sure, future humans will build simulations, but maybe we shouldn’t. Maybe you can escape, and maybe you can create and destroy them."

176071348,"I lost 5kg in 3 weeks using exercise and a below 1500 calories a day. It then stopped, as i did everything the same and remained the same weight. I did the same last year and exactly the same thing happened. I did a little internet research and found that metabolism slows and adjusts to calorie intake eventually. To get over the plateau you need to either increase exercise or lower calories again. I suppose the same thing would happen again. I can’t lower calorie intake anymore than this without starving myself, and my exercise plan has crashed due to pain possibly associated with early onset fibromyalgia; so i am stuck at 79kg at the moment. I can’t see any light at the end of the tunnel, and giving up seems inevitable as the four pack may soothe my troubles at the end of this week."

176071357,Without meds I am much worse. I become the most grandiose person on earth. After sz symptoms I started feeling that I needed to study and become a researcher. Then I thought I was a genius that will find new scientific discoveries. I then thought I should aim “higher” and become a priest. At the end before my suicide attempt and my sz diagnosis I thought I was God and that I should prove it by killing myself so I tried suicide. Drs in the emergency said that I would be dead from liver failure if my parents brought me late to the emergency.

174360161,"Thanks for the words. I probably should take your advise and work with a therapist. I need to get this anger out of me. It’s so frustrating being told you have schizophrenia. For me it makes me constantly second guess myself. I wish I could know the absolute truth of what happened, why/what were the motives. If what I think happened is the reality of the situation (that it was all maliciously planned) then I already forgive them. Done. I deserved it probably. But I’m not sure I can forgive myself. One time when I was going through after effects of drug use, I had to get out of my apartment because I was hallucinating a lot and decided to go to the ER for help…I show up and 5 minutes later some guy (a nurse) my age comes up to the triage intake and acts like me, talks about the same issues as me, everything. He even throws a tantrum when we both get into the back. It was my doctor on call that day. He hates me. I moved to BC from AB 3 weeks ago, and he wont even send me a fricking refill for m
y antipsychotics. So screw it, I wont take medication. My point in saying all this is this: If people don’t like what I’m doing or who I am…why don’t they just tell me what I should be doing instead? Not one person is looking out for me. Being a moron who dropped out in grade 6 and doesn’t know anything at all, I really think it’s vital I could have a single person who I could trust. And trust them based on not just their hollow words, but also by their meaningful, clear actions. I’m sorry I’m thrashing around rn…I’m being a self proclaimed little victim again… And I do it all on the internet. I’m honestly just too much for shits sake. It’s hard to even be in public or around anyone. I’m very and deeply ashamed of what I became."

You’re only as happy as your saddest child they say and I find that is true. I wish I could shut off my mind sometimes but the worry and the anxiety go on and on. When the stress gets to be too much my head starts to get noisy, I can’t handle the noise. It’s too much. This is when it would be nice to have an Ativan.

Cause when you cant think properly and your brain is in some fog, then you get anxiety imo… Cause I have insight too of this … Yeap, my sz really affected my ‘‘head’’ if I can say so… I have all kind of sensations there and my thinking was bad for years… In fact, I don’t have the impression to think… I do it, but its like my brain needs more blood there and air… Its like I cant ‘‘feel’’ my thoughts if you see even though, that I am thinking…"

176071457,"I take gabapentin for anxiety. It’s in the same family. I’m trying to quit it now, because it has side effects I don’t like. I absolutely needed it for a while, but it is dangerous. It is highly addictive, and you build up a tolerance fast, so you end up wanting to take more and more. The side effects that bother me are weight gain, shortness of breath, and insomnia (though most people sleep better on it). Statistically, no medication is effective long-term for anxiety. CBT works much better, but it also takes a while. I think taking anxiety meds can help immediately, while you learn CBT exercises. They come with a lot of risks, though. Almost all of them are addictive. If you don’t want pregablin, you could ask your doctor about taking benadryl as needed. It can work as an anti anxiety med, and it’s OTC with a much lower risk of addiction."

While psychotic I was actively “communicating” with reality and the universe in a spiritual way. Once the medication made the delusions go away I found that many of my beliefs were based on the same trains of thought as I experienced while delusional, this made me abandon alot of irrationality which has turned me someway towards an agnostic mindset.

This is really the only way to try to protect people and hopefully slow down the spread of the virus. My county started the shelter in place already on Tuesday. Now all of CA is sheltering in place. I wish that more states and regions were doing this as well. We are able to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, and other essential businesses, etc for essentials but must do our best to stay at least 6 ft apart. Veterinarians and emergency vets are also still open but have started implementing a policy where they get your pet from you and you stay in the car. This is safer for everyone. Plumbers and other services are still available for emergency repairs and are taking extra precautions to stay safe. We are also allowed to get “to go” food from restaurants or drivethroughs although I’m kind of leary of eating restaurant food. We are allowed to go assist family mem
bers so I am able to drive to my Mom’s house in the next city to help her with groceries etc. Garbage is still picked up and the mail, ups, FedEx, Amazon are still making deliveries.

It seems to help me laugh a little about it and makes my coworkers laugh. Granted at my job we all do this when we mess up or do something no so smart. As far as common sense, I do the same thing. I usually laugh it off and follow it up with something like “You know that I can be a little stupid sometimes”, then proceed to go do what I forgot to do/fix what I messed up. I’ve noticed the biggest thing is being willing to go back and do whatever task you forgot to do or didnt do right. If you make an effort most employers are a little more lenient there."

In April and May, all of my shifts turned into remote work which was OK, but since I went back to transporting in June, I have been absent from work more than half of the time, I think. Mentally, this has been a little hard as well. Also, I’ve had an over spending problem, and I’ve used up a lot of my savings for about a year. I can’t say how much, but this was a lot of money. I know I can’t live with my parents forever. I know I have to work more, set a goal for the future, and feel confident. Right now, I feel kind of stuck where I am, especially with my leg. I’ve thought of changing my job to full remote work. But I’m not sure if I have the ability to change my job. I feel this is a dark time with COVID and the economy. I want to stay positive.

Then I felt this depression that I didn’t feel since I was young (and needed ect when young). I didn’t want that again. So I went to my doctor. Went on effexor and it started ‘working’ immediately on a small dose. I felt as beautiful as a movie star and bigger than anything. Dr was confused about that and slowly rise me to therapeutic level. I ended up manic or mixes or something. Lamictal and lithium eventually stabilize me somewhat. Never was the same. Was diagnosed with bipolar. It was my first time sick off work. I have been getting less functional ever since.

Again I love your reply."
176071655,Prescription drugs need to be taken with caution as many of them have serious sideffects. Atomexetine can cause heart rhythm issues even though its not a stimulant and also almost no effect on ADHD. Anti seizure medication sodium valproate can cause memory issues so it should be taken as last resort for serious seizures and bipolar mania. Many antidepressants and antipsychotics can cause QT prolongation. So if you already have some heart issues then these can cause issues particularly if taken long term.
176071656,"I was also in a relationship but I think it was a big mistake. He looked ok at first but things never blossomed into love and I wasn’t good at choosing partners.

I find guys in the z generation better in bed for me lol."

176071695,I live with my grandmother and she has alzheimers. It’s been a nightmare dealing with her illness. My cousin lives here and helps. Her illness is causing my schiz to flair up. My grandmother married my grandfather before I was born. My mom and aunt are her step daughters. My entire life my grandmother never wanted anything to do with her biological family. Her brother fathered a kid with his own daughter. Her sister stole their parents estate. Before she got sick her priest told her she needed to make amends with her family. She invited them into our lives. Now she’s forgotten all the horrible things they did. Before my grandmother got sick she made a will leaving everything to my me my aunt and mom. If my mom goes first I get her half of the estate. My mom has stage 4 lung cancer the worst form of it. My grandmothers family is manipulating her against us. The will is set in stone and iron clad. Her family snuck her to a lawyer and convinced her to try and undo the will. Except we have notes fro
m her doctor that she’s in capable of making her own decisions. Basically my family is at war with my grandmothers family. They call my grandmother and tell her we’re stealing everything. Which causes my schiz to go bug-o. I don’t like being accused of stealing especially by someone I’ve always loved and trusted. My grandmother has fallen a couple times and I already has social services show up on our door step. Her family says I was abusing her. We’ve blocked phone calls from her family. They live 2 hours away. Two times last month they called the cops to do a welfare check. I don’t like cops showing up on my doorstep at 10 pm. I’ve lived with my grandmother for 18 years. I’ve been taking care of her for 2. My mom is sick and my aunt hasn’t been over since Xmas. This has all been on my shoulders. Right now section 8 is open in my area. I’ve only lived on my own twice. Once I made it a year the second time 6 months. I kept getting fired from my jobs and had to move back home. I’m on SSDI 
now. I’m wondering if I should go for the section 8 and leave this situation to my aunt. I feel like a trapped animal and I want out. Screw the estate I just want out. I’m really conflicted part of me wants to stay and fight but I don’t want to end up in jail for something I didn’t do. I don’t like being accused of stealing or beating her up. I’ve installed camera’s in the house in case something happens they can’t blame me. If I take the section 8 it’s an hour away from here. I’ve had my current doctor for 20 years. I’m worried I’d have to switch doctors and find one closer. I’ve had run ins with some screw ball doctors before I met my current one. I’d hate to cross paths with a doctor that don’t support my disability. I don’t know what to do.

It does seem like the psychosis has been coming for awhile. The non stop tombstone talk, hit man talk, people sitting outside for over a year watching you, neighbors following you upstairs when they can’t even see you. Considering how long you’ve been thinking this is happening and nothing has happened to you I would have to say you’re in psychosis and a psychotic break could be coming. Hopefully not, but given the fact that you believe it there’s a chance the stress could overcome your body. It seems you may be a little med resistant but I’m not sure what all you’ve tried. Since you yell and cuss them they are probably saying things back to you and probably think you’re crazy and rightfully so. They too shouldn’t have to live with threatening behavior. However, no one is sitting outside your apartmen
t 24/7 watching you for a year. People have lives and jobs, bills to pay, people to take care of and above all a life of their own that doesn’t revolve around you.

We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care. When looking at an in silico clinical trial specifically, it means an individualized computer simulation used in the development or regulatory evaluation of a medicinal product, device, or intervention. While completely simulated clinical trials are not feasible with current technology and understanding of biology, their development would be expected to have major benefits over current in vivo clinical trials, and the FDA is already planning for a future in which more than half of all clinical trial data will come from computer simulations. Moreover, artificial intelligence can also provide answers to the usually asked question: “why does this work for this patient but not another one?” A.I-building methods, namely machine learning and deep learning have the 
potential to train a model that will then be able to find patterns and clusters in otherwise unstructured data – and seek out information researchers didn’t expect to be there.

176071795,_AT_MENTION_ You are really reaching for anything to justify your delusions. It still doesn’t make any sense why they would go through all these expensive procedures to try to get you to look like him when they could just pick someone from their own population who looks like him. Why go to all this trouble of Plastic surgery and Melanin Injections? It doesn’t make any sense.
176071796,The worst symptom I had was alogia.
176071797,"Last year I had an appointment with a therapist, and only in one session I understood how should we live to have more functional lives. At the end of the session she explained to me that I have a chronic disease, as other people have it too, like diabetes for e.g. So we have our limitations and we must do stuff to have the most functional life possible with this disease. Diabetes(type 1) have to work out every day and inject themselves with insulin to have a normal live, and we with sz/sza have to work out as well, sleep at least 8 hours and in normal night hours(not like from 2 am to 10 am) and avoid doing drugs. Obviously it’s easier said than done, but we can turn around our limitations just by being as healthy as we can. So to answer your question, what’s our role in society? The same as everyone else, we have this disease and other people have other diseases, some are lucky and don’t have none. So when we go to the doctor and share our successes and failures we are adding more data to fi
ght this disease and improving other peoples lifes besides our own. As group with this disease I bet 50 years ago their life quality was way worst than ours, so sometimes I think we have some social responsibility for those who may have this disease in the future."

I was having issues at home. It seems everytime I make progress, someone screws with me or sets me 10 steps back. In my other lives, I have memories of being a computer engineer and finished my math degree. Different parallel universes while off meds. I don’t expect people to believe me and people get tired of hearing me talk about it. I was more psychotic but had more energy and motivation and drive. People think I’m either delusional or fantasizing. But it works according to MWT and other timelines. I talked about all this extensively and get tired of talking about it. If true, am I really schizophrenic? Little things bother me like noise
s and sounds on the cell phone. I see that my IP address or location is different than where I am. Stuff like that makes me paranoid. Stuff like the news websites don’t have encryption sometimes.

174360269,"just thinking back to my undiagnosed days of schizophrenia. I think it really started developing at 19-20, I had terrible social anxiety which prevented me from going to my classes in college. all I would do is watch movies, and play video games instead of going to class. I also had disorganized speech and would often come up with outlandish thoughts in my head and blurt them out to friends of mine. and there was some paranoia as well, I thought I was being surveilled and that the cops were out to get me. this was shortly after the patriot act became law, and that just fed into my only delusions at the time. I never saw a psychiatrist and continued to work for money to pay rent and buy groceries for a few years. despite working I still had problems with negatives, like lack of motivation and some hygiene issues, I would shower, but didn’t like to shave or cut my hair, and was a slob at home. also I would always choose fast food, over cooking for convenience sake. finally I was forced to see a psy
chiatrist at age 26 and I was immediately diagnosed. the hallucinations would start a little later that year after I did a 12 day fast, I had also hiked about 200 miles without eating so lost a bunch off weight. then the voices were there to stay until I was about 31 and forced on meds. looking back, I had, had a psychology class my first year of college, that I actually went to. and had read some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. I knew I fit some of the criteria, but just saw it as institutional bias. I remember thinking that there was nothing wrong with me and that schizophrenia was probably over diagnosed nowadays. just thought it was some behavioral issues some people wanted to medicate and label. and that’s it. those were the early days for me."

176071873,The good thing is that you see it for the disgusting thing it is. One thing to keep in mind is that the only time you broke the habit was when you had a gf. I found that breaking the habit made me hate women less and that I was OK with not finding a gf eventually. I need to truly love them before that can happen. Porn caused me to have disturbing dreams that ended when I quit it.

174360275,"Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous group, but the biggest subgroup appears to be the delusion one. What starts as a conspiracy theory/crackpot theory eventually ends up in a psychotic episode. No supposition theory: The normal mechanisms that are at play in the formation of normal delusions (conspiracy theories, crackpot scientist situations, etc) are enough to explain everything, with no need for any suppositions (genetic influence, dysregulation of dopamine due to not working, etc.). The theory has 2 problems: How do I make the jump from a normal conspiracy theory into a temporary psychotic state, with elevated dopamine levels? - Easy as a piece of cake. How do I explain the power that such a delusion has right from the beginning, since before entering a psychotic state or while being between episodes? Are normal delusion mechanisms enough to explain this? - Difficult question, maybe yes maybe no Supposition theory problem: If there is X, Y, Z factor (genetic influence, infection, dysregulation of 
dopamine, etc) then why isn’t the whole thinking of the person affected equally? Why is it affected only when it comes to the subject of the delusion? From your experience, what are your thoughts about the second problem of the no-supposition theory? Do you feel that the normal powers at play in delusion formation (self-esteem problems, taking narcissistic supply from the theory, the beginner effect, etc.) are enough to explain the power of the delusion prior to the triggering of a psychotic episode, or do you feel that an extra element might be needed?"

Then, I decided to experiment and see if maybe the light might have possibly been coming from the windows. I pulled up my covers of several layers of thick, solidly woven blankets and sleeping blankets and looked underneath. Under all these covers, I saw lots and lots of speckles and dots of light across the whole inside cover of the blanket. I experimented further. I put a thick, feather pillow between me, and the covers. Still those same dots of light all across the pillow. And all this in a pitch dark room. At this point, I said, ok, I’m hallucinating. And so I turned on the lights and everything went back to normal. I realize this could have been hypnogogic hallucinations."

174360309,"# Potential New Biomarker for Psychosis Severity Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) levels are lower in individuals with first episode psychosis (FEP) and even lower in those with resistant disease, suggesting the enzyme may be a biomarker of disease severity. In a longitudinal cohort study, investigators found patients with FEP had significantly reduced ACE levels compared with their healthy peers. With blood concentrations of the enzyme significantly reduced in those who were treatment-resistant, “ACE alterations appear to be already present at the disease onset” and results suggest “a possible relationship with disease severity,” note the researchers, led by investigator _NAME_, MD, a resident in psychiatry, University of Bari _NAME_ in Italy. Moreover, the finding that lower ACE levels were associated with greater cognitive impairment on neuropsychological tests indicates the enzyme plays a role in “the alteration of neurocognitive abilities” in patients with FEP. Taken together, 
the results “highlight ACE as a promising peripheral biomarker to identify patients at risk of treatment resistance to antipsychotics,” the investigators report. The findings were presented at the Congress of the Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) 2020 Virtual Meeting. Mechanisms ""Poorly Understood"" Previous studies suggest ACE may play a role in neurologic and psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, through alterations in function or blood concentrations. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease onset and response to antipsychotics in patients with FEP “remain poorly understood,” the researchers note. In addition, “despite adequate antipsychotic treatment, 20% of patients have persistent symptoms.” To determine whether ACE levels are already altered in FEP patients, the investigators examined data on 138 patients with FEP and 115 healthy controls. After measuring blood concentrations in 122 of the patients and 78 controls, they found that ACE levels were si
gnificantly lower in FEP patients ( P = 4.1x10-13) after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, duration of illness, smoking status, and chlorpromazine equivalents. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels, which were measured in 19 patients and 18 controls, were also significantly lower in individuals with FEP ( P = .01), with a strong correlation observed between blood and CSF levels ( P = .0005). Next, the team used Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis criteria to compare ACE levels in 32 treatment-resistant patients and 106 non­–treatment-resistant patients. Results showed that ACE blood levels were significantly lower in the treatment-resistant patients ( P = .03). Finally, the association between ACE blood levels and range of clinical and neurocognitive variables were examined across all FEP patients. The Scale for the Assessment of Negative and Positive Symptoms was administered, along with a battery of tests looking at processing speed, working memory, verbal learning and memory, visual learning an
d memory, ideational fluency, and executive function. All were combined into a composite score. While there was no association between ACE blood levels and symptom severity in the patients, there was a significant association between levels and verbal memory ( P = .007) and composite cognitive score ( P = .04). Notable Finding Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, _NAME_, MD, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, said the finding that ACE levels were associated with lower cognition scores is “notable in that we don’t really have any treatments for cognition.” “Antipsychotic drugs treat more of the famous symptoms of hallucinations and delusions and disordered speech, but they don’t really help cognition a whole lot — and too much medicine might even make that worse,” said _PERSON_, who was not involved with the research. “So it’s interesting to have another biomarker that might relate a sym
ptom of schizophrenia that we don’t really have a good grip on addressing.” However, he noted that this study is “preliminary,” has not looked at longitudinal changes in ACE in the same patients, and is one of “many” correlation studies. “I like to say you can pretty much Google any chemical in the body and somebody has a claim about it and schizophrenia,” _PERSON_ said. Nevertheless, the current analysis is “convergent” with past studies on ACE, including those that have found associations between polymorphisms in the enzyme and schizophrenia, he noted. Moreover, research has shown that ACE facilitates glutamate transmission, specifically via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the prefrontal cortex, “which is probably the brain region most tied to schizophrenia abnormalities,” _PERSON_ said. No Tie to Inflammation The findings do contrast, however, with the increasing body of evidence linking schizophrenia to inflammation. _PERSON_ said that is not surprising, as the more that i
s learned about schizophrenia, “the less it is likely to be a single homogeneous entity but something more akin to intellectual disability.” “We’re finding that there are different subtypes of schizophrenia, some of which might have more of an inflammatory tie and others which don’t.” He added that it might be possible over the longer term to cluster patients by ACE levels and other biomarkers and then follow them long term to “see if we can predict outcomes better than purely clinical terms.” In this way, _PERSON_ believes that psychiatry may become more like rheumatology, “which I’d say is the area of medicine, at least in terms of making diagnoses, most similar.” The etiology of conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis is “not absolutely known” and there is “probably no single cause,” with the diagnosis relying on clinical findings alongside biomarker tests. “I think psychiatry is, long term, hoping to discover some biomarkers…that would be used together with the 
clinical findings to help come to more clinical agreement on how to define cases — and would be predictive long term in terms of the course of illness,” _PERSON_ concluded. The study had no specific funding. The study investigators and Sedlak have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

174360313,"I think Occams Razor is over used and misapplied a lot. I don’t claim to understand it, but I know people have claimed MWT is wrong because of the complexity and because of Occams razor. I remember a physicist _NAME_ saying MWT is actually the simpler case and the most simple of all quantum mechanics interpretations because it doesn’t require new or complex math. I agree with him wholeheartedly. Same thing with simulation theory. Look up _NAME_. I don’t think believing in simulation theory is a delusion or a sign of schizophrenia, but the two aren’t mutually exclusive. Last, I think Occams Razor will support Simulation Theory in the future someday. I know we live in a sim and MWT is correct because I remember finding out in a past life in the future. It is going to happen again."
176071984,I Am Sincerely Confused. What is it You Are Saying?.
176071985,"How do you know i have schizophrenia, if my doctors think i havent? I just dont believe in the idea that psychosis should always be treated by medication. Indefinetely. Or that it is always a lifelong and deteriorating disorder. I know of several people who have successfully stopped medication, especially after just one episode. Which doesn’t mean all people can do this or there is no risk. There is the issue of a return of symptoms. But there is also the issue of rebound psychosis. Both are possible. Hence the great importance of slow and cautious tapering instead of cold turkey quitting. I think that is crucial to understand before a quitting attempt. Even doctors here now acknowledge this and i think this is very important for people’s safety."

176071998,"I just started watching a tv show called live rescue. It’s about what first responders do, like paramedics and EMTs. I can relate because I was a first responder myself as a lifeguard. In this episode, there were two folks in different situations threatening to jump from a building and tree. One of the guys, they were both guys, was described as having a psych history and may be off his meds. I wouldn’t have known this if they didn’t say. No one would. Doing this gives a very wrong and skewed representation of the mentally ill. It deprives us of liberty and freedom. Now I wouldn’t go as far to say that we are oppressed, but there are certain _USER_ID_ about us that need addressed. I feel talking about our experiences is a great step in the right direction."
176071999,"I think institutions, if done right and free of _USER_ID_, can be a very good thing for this country. We badly need better mental health care like many other countries. We can step up and be a world leader in the field if we do this right, and with our humanity intact."
176072000,Did you get that before?
176072001,It could be generalized anxiety. Try squared breathing and other grounding exercises. They help a lot of people
174360324,What do you do if you have really bad anxiety?
176072002,Sounds like Derealization. Don’t worry it goes away.
174360311,The first time they put me on a big dose and it took like 1 to 2 months for the voices to go. However I had been psychotic for a long time 8 months. The second time I went on a small dose after 2 weeks of psychosis and the voices went in one week. I still get a bit of paranoia and yes intrusive thoughts haven’t gone away.

176072006,"Congratulations!!! I went through all five pregnancies while I was on medication. There are certain ones you can’t take. I was on Seroquel and Lamictal at the time. My pregnancies were all high risk because of the Lamictal which can cause birth defects. However, my high risk doctors said that I would have to be on a high dose of Lamictal for them to be concerned. My last baby was born at 27 weeks due to the fact that I got HELLP and nothing to do with my mental medications. They told me to breast pump while she was in the NICU because they considered it okay. She is a very healthy four year old now and fine. It can be okay. I would recommend you get a high risk doctor so they can monitor you. Try to be on the lowest doses you can be without have a psychotic episode. I had a psychotic breakdown the last week I was there due to post partem depression. They put me in the psych ward for a week and got me back on my feet. I guess my ultimate point I’ m trying to make is keep seeing a psychiatrist an
d see a high risk obgyn doctor. It will be okay. Take care of yourself and I wish you the best of luck."

176072008,"Hi everyone, My Mom came home with my brother and myself from the hospital late Saturday afternoon. There was talk between Mom and myself about coming home several hours earlier, but when I told my brother, he wasn’t so enthused. He at least wanted to meet with one of the doctors, because he was concerned that she might soon get sick again. So, at least she’s home. My brother is pretty much a know-it-all, so he can be hard to deal with at times. It wasn’t just him though; I think Saturday was a bad day for me. He got a lot done though around the house as well. We had a good Thanksgiving lunch at Swiss Chalet to boot. And, to cap it all off, I brought my acoustic guitar and tabs and tab books and my brother and I had sort of a jamming session. I just got done dropping him off at the airport. Phew!"

176072034,"hi _AT_MENTION_ , do you cook much? here’s 2 healthy, tasty dinner options… BEEF CURRY 1. Curry paste 1 tbs corriander seeds (aka cilantro seeds) 2 tbs mustard seeds 1 tbs cumin seeds 2 tbs smoked paprika 4 red chillies 4 cloves garlic 6-9cm fresh ginger, grated 1/2 C tomato paste (I’m Australian so this may go by another name, like tomato concentrate) 1 tbs ghee 1/3 C apple cider vinegar 1 tbs maple syrup 2. Curry 2 x 400g cans of tomatoes 11/2 C stock (I just make this from stock powder) 1.2kg beef 1 eggplant (aka aubergine ) 2 cinnamon sticks 3 start anise fresh corriander leaves to serve (aka cilantro) brown rice METHOD Pre-heat oven 170 degrees Celcius. Dry roast (that means dry fry in a fry-pan/skillet) corriander seeds, mustard seeds, cumin seeds in pan until fragrant. (the mustard seeds pop so just take off heat when they do that!) Food process/grind (use whatever blade-type machine you have) roasted seeds until powdery. Add all other curry paste ingredients & process/blend. Put curry 
paste, tomatoes & stock in an oven-proof pot. Add beef, eggplant, cinnamon sticks & star anise. Cook in oven 3-4 hours until beef tender. You can use any old cut of beef as you cook it for 4 hours so it will be tender. I actually hold back the eggplant until the last hour of cooking so it doesn’t disintegrate. This is an easy and very yummy curry of you like spices. Skip the chillies if you don’t like eat. Serve with brown rice. Recipe 2…Healthy tofu & vegetable stir-fry 1. Basic Asian-style sauce/marinade 1 tsp sesame oil 2 tbs Braggs Liquid Aminos or tamari or soy sauce 2 tbsp maple syrup 2 tabs rice vinegar 1 tbs balsamic vinegar 1 pinch red chili flakes 1/2 tsp Chinese five-spice poweder 1 tsp ginger powder 1 tsp ground ginger 250g firm tofu 2-4 C vegetables METHOD Chop firm tofu into bite-sized pieces. Mix with sauce/marinade in an air-tight container & leave to marinade in the fridge overnight. Prep 2-4C of fresh vegetables (corn, capsicum [aka peppers], carrots, zucchini [aka courgettes], celery, 
asparagus, green beans, _NAME_ or other greens, snow peas, any other veg you like!) _PERSON_ the tofu in a frypan (aka skillet) until brown crust appears both sides, set aside. You may need to do it in batches. Add all the other veggies & all the remaining marinade to the pan. Lightly cook until veggies are tender. Add the tofu back to the pan. Serve with brown rice or basmati rice. So the recipes here need you to buy a lot of base ingredients. I can assure you that if you continue, it’s good value for money as you will use the ingredients up over time. I hope these recipes are helpful.

174360333,"I saw both the TedX talk and the first SBSK interview and never realized that it was the same person. Not until I saw the third video did I make the connection. She said that she delayed the second interview with SBSK because she noticed that on the first SBSK interview comments on YouTube people were saying that they felt her disease was progressing since she seemed worse then than on her TedX talk previously, and she didn’t want the second interview to show her symptomatic because she didn’t want people to get the impression that the disease is progressive in her case. She just fluctuates I guess. What interests me and is the reason I posted it is that the first video (TedX talk) inspired me to try and become high functioning, whereas her first SBSK interview made me feel better about being mostly asymptomatic in comparison to her. Sort of a better her than me thing. And in the second SBSK interview I’m just amazed at how lucid (and pretty) she is!"

174360332,"I tried 4 aps and I found Risperdal best for positive symptoms. Abilify was best for negative symptoms but I had bad side effects at 25mg like multiple addictions and compulsions. Is it worth the risk of having positive symptoms and addictions like gambling, hypersexuality and compulsive shopping in exchange for a small improvement in negative symptoms? I don’t know if 10mg Abilify is enough to stop my positive symptoms because I was on 25mg last time. On aps other than Abilify I stay in bed all day everyday and never go out of my house. I have also have issues with hygiene, bathing once a week with great effort. Would you take those risks to slightly improve severe negative symptoms?"

The boss use to stand over us with a stop watch to see how many car doors we could weld. Each door had 35 welds and if I missed one I’d get written up. I was using a spot welding gun that weighed 200lbs. It was suspended from a cable which took some of the weight off but it was still heavy.

176072091,the way they diagnose is very different to here in the uk. the reason im not diagnosed sz eventhough i heard voices for over 7 months is due to the fact im currently on a low dose of ap. you are not even on an ap. i dont undestand why a serious condition like sz does not have a universal diagnosis criteriaa.
176072092,"Stress worsens sz and psychosis, some here got diagnosed at 40 y.o. I suggest you wait if your psy said so. I would see a pdr when you hear voices during the day. Your pdr needs to be sure before prescribing meds bcz starting meds and stopping them can cause sz/psychosis by itself. Also meds have many unwanted and bad side effects. Their benefits overweight their side effects only if you really have psychosis or sz."

He told me its a glucophage that eats sugar in your blood and blocks carbs absorption with food. Its a medication for diabetis but I don’t have diabetes. The pharmacist was like wtf and asked me why he prescribed me a diabetis medication if I am not diabetic. I guess my psychiatrist knows more than pharmacists in medicine hahaha I have been using it for weeks but it only decreased my weight by a couple of pounds because I rarely get out of bed and never exercise.

Hi there, hope you are coping as well as could be expected, within my experience of the ‘voices’ this is how it appears to work, They will use or say anything in order to gain a response, it could be nonsense, or it could be a little more troubling. The best thing to do is never engage or enter into conversations with them as it will turn on you.

176072228,"I suffer from _NAME_’s syndrome, or the _NAME_ Show delusion, named after the movie. I’ve believed since I was nine that people are watching me through hidden cameras over the internet every second of every day, and that I’m a famous celebrity known by millions. If someone reading this were to tell me they don’t know who I am, I would assume they simply hadn’t heard of me or were lying to cover up what the people behind making me live in an involuntary reality TV show are doing so they can keep it going. As much stress and paranoia as this delusion causes, with me wanting to entertain and please my "" audience"" lest they start to hate me, I believe it’s a coping mechanism. I started having this belief during a period of isolation after my family had just moved. I had no friends, I was lonely, and this period was extremely stressful with my mother starting to treat me differently than she had before, and developing this belief made me feel like I wasn’t alone and made me feel special. 
I was also neglected by my mother and no one knew, and having this belief made me feel like people finally saw and knew about what my mother was doing to me. Now, as an adult, this belief helps me feel good about myself. I believe that most of the people that watch me love me, and I have yet to seek therapy for this delusion because I’m afraid of how I’ll cope without it. I have extremely low self esteem and I can’t tell you how comforting it is to think I’m some extremely beloved celebrity that all the people I look up to know exists, all by simply being myself. I have no idea how I would cope with coming down from living eleven years with this extreme of a grandiose delusion. Also, believe it or not, I’ve never seen The _NAME_ Show and developed this belief about my life entirely on my own. The typical sufferer of this delusion develops it after seeing the movie. I most likely developed it because my mother watched a ton of reality shows. Do any of you have delusions you think you’ve developed t
o cope? I know a lot of people get comfort from thinking they’re prophets or martyrs or God is talking directly to them, but that’s the extent of my knowledge of delusions that bring comfort."

I was homeless and had to do something about it… Such a flippant comment. This makes sense. I think having a new doctor treating me is what has led to this. My CPN thinks my old pdoc and I knew each other a bit too well, as he had treated me for 15 years on and off, and the CPN says he missed it. I might be getting some more psychology.

Then I knew they were in my mind, and I got angry with them as well as started ignoring them. With a little time, they disappeared and never came back.

I’ve run into a couple of people that I meet in the hospital, though not necessarily that they had schizophrenia. When I saw them, I mostly wanted to avoid (one because he was not a great person and the other because it was while I was working). One person I did say hello to because we ran into each other in a mental health clinic. It was genuinely nice to see her. I think in general I am functioning pretty well. I work, study, and spend a good deal of time with friends. I wouldn’t say I’m 100% but don’t think I’ve finished the process of recovery yet."

174360391,Yeah actually when I joined this forum I was having a hard time finding a forum that had good discussions about psychosis. the bipolar forums were mainly people talking about mania or depressions. and at the time I was only dealing with psychosis issues.

176072364,"I don’t know how well you tolerate Haldol, so it is hard for me to tell you what to expect, but I was on the long acting shot for about six or seven years. I don’t tolerate Haldol well, so those years were a misery for me. The decanoate shot generally gave me a lesser dose than taking Haldol orally. When I was taking 40 mg daily in tablet form it was utter misery. Just about all the typical antipsychotics make me miserable. When they first started me on the shot I was getting 150 mg a month. That comes out to roughly 5 mg a day, so it wasn’t as bad as the decanoate shot. They lessened my dose over the years, until I was taking about 100 mg a month. I got into trouble taking that small a dose. Right now I am taking Geodon and Seroquel, and they handle my symptoms well without the deadening effect on my brain. For some people Geodon is The Answer."

176072366,I made that mistake at first for years. Eventually the tiredness goes away.
176072367,At age 44 I look back on my teenage years and think to myself how the hell did I survive or not end up in prison? I was completely out of control growing up. I was the biggest menace in the school. They had me labeled as mentally disturbed. I had a high IQ but no interest in learning. To me from the age of 13 life was one big party. Some classes I liked some I didn’t. I would completely fail one class but ace another. I went to school high every day. My school had a art program through the local collage and there were only 9 kids in the class. I was the only one that got excepted from my grade. Some of the stuff I saw and did was unreal growing up. I tell people the stuff I’ve seen and even my close friends think I’m full of it. It all came crashing down when I got schiz at age 20. I’ve been shot at robbed at gunpoint. I had a butcher knife held to my throat. I was one of the biggest drug dealers in my area. 2 months after I quit and ened up with schiz I picked up the paper and all of my for
mer contacts were on the front page. It seemed as tho I dodged bullets at every turn and got away with it. I ran from the police once and had the entire city of cops looking for me including a helicopter and I got away. I stole my step dads Porsche and I did 140 mph for 7 minutes. I was dodging in and out of cars like a nascar driver. I survived 2 really bad car accidents. One accident my car was practically ripped in half. The other car I rolled on the free way and got ejected. I landed in the grass without a scratch. I had no fear and I lived life on the edge. I swear someone above had to of been looking out for me. I’ve got even wilder stories but the mods might come after me if I told them. Here I am all these years later and the highlight of my day is feeding my aquarium fish. I miss the stuff I did when I was young. I’m just thankful I’m not dead or in prison.

176072369,Can you call your psychiatrist?
176072370,with the label of sz/sza did you ever??
176072371,I got psychosis from doing drugs. I started smoking weed when I was 13. By the time I was 20 my life was a train wreck. I was using $50k a year in drugs. I started one day by taking some acid at 3 pm by 6 pm I popped 5 Xanax by 10 pm I was smoking heroin and weed by 6 am I started drinking a half gallon of whisky until I knocked myself out around noon. I woke up at 8pm and started all over again. After a couple years of this behavior psychosis started to sink in. It was a slow decent into madness. I would get high and become psychotic. I started think people were plotting to kill me and stuff. One night I grabbed a butcher knife and stood outside my stepdads bedroom at 2 am. I was thinking it’s him or me. I decided against it and walked into my step sisters room and punched her in the leg while she was sleeping. She woke up screaming I didn’t do it I didn’t do it. I was completely unhinged and grabbed her by the throat the next day. I almost choked her to death. I quit using drugs because I go
t to paranoid to leave the house. I wouldn’t walk in front of the windows if the blinds were open. My step dad threaten to shoot my mom. Because of my behavior the house was extremely volatile. My mom had my stepdad arrested and got a restraining order. I hid in the basement for 9 months. My mom couldn’t get me out. One day it was like a switch went off in my head and I started hearing voices. She talked me into going to the hospital. In the hospital I was paranoid they were trying to poison me so I was sticking my finger down my throat to throw up the meds. They gave me an injection that basically drugged the hell out me for a month. It brought me out the psychosis. It was a long process to recover and I stayed away from drugs for the most part. I tried smoking weed a few times but it made me paranoid. I still drank off and on for years. Never had a problem with alcohol though. It never became a habit. I gave up drinking 10 years ago. I got sick of hang overs. I have extreme anxiety and I take Valium. I 
enjoy the buzz but more then anything it calms my nerves.

176072374,After taking meds? I hate this feeling
174360400,"I’ll echo _AT_MENTION_ and say you need to talk to your doctor before taking steroids. I take Abilify too and it did mess with my motivation a lot, But that’s something you also need to talk to the doctor about. There could be medications you can take to combat it or you could get into therapy and see if they can help you with motivation/coping skills. How long have you been on the medication?"
176072375,"Discuss this in depth with your therapist, if that is possible. If you can make it without the med’s that is fine, but be careful."
176072376,Does anybody have this?
176072377,I haven’t been on as much bc it’s spring here and I’ve been outside
176072378,I’m glad you’re going. I hope you’re able to get some rest and your meds get changed to something that actually works. I’ll be thinking if you.

176072387,"That’s not true, _AT_MENTION_"
176072388,"So I have one more coincidence that I’d like to run by you guys. It’s along the same lines as my other one here it is. I’m in my apartment listening to _NAME_ commenting on what I’m doing when suddenly another voice kalem enters the conversation. (_PERSON_ is a guy I know in real life, we had a fight Three years before which was a pretty traumatic experience for me and it left deep scars within me. He’s a typical bro kinda guy who gets into a lot of fights and I’m the opposite. I had no suspicions of him being in the _NAME_ before I heard his voice) Anyway, kalem says to _NAME_ ‘Italy is alright, he can be a dope sometimes but he is alright leave him alone’. _PERSON_ then leaves the conversation. A few minutes go bye and I decide to look out the window and I see kalem parked right outside getting into his car and driving off. So obviously I think he must’ve been in an apartment next door watching me on a camera with _NAME_. How can you guys explain it?"
176072389,I’m totally ok with it
176072390,"I need hugs too, but I am too proud to ask people. Lol"
176072391,Faith in what? Unless that’s a topic to avoid?
176072392,You cant go by one bad review.
176072393,Does anyone else experience this? I.e a mismatch between how much time has actually passed and how much you think has passed . I had lunch out with a granddaughter and my gt granddaughter around noon time . It’s now 17.15 but it doesn’t seem that anything like 5 hours has passed since then .
176072394,"Sounds scary cici, sorry you went through that. The voices are so convincing I still think they are real. My voices also told me they were gonna put a curse on me to make me kill my mother. I had to do this to be let join the _NAME_ which if I did they said I wouldn’t be hearing voices anymore. Thankfully they were only empty threats from the voices. It is soo scary isn’t it, they sound so real it’s just like someone talking to you."
176072395,"I was on cogentin in tandem with risperidone at first, but I stopped being prescribed cogentin several months ago. I’m definitely going to ask my psych nurse about that because that doesn’t seem right."
176072396,Don’t get me wrong I really want everyone to take this seriously but I don’t want anyone to panic. Just follow our guidelines on anonymity and you’ll be fine.
176072397,"I am also traumatised by the hell thing. feel like if i don’t make more effort to be healthy then my unhealthy mind will linger on like that when i die. sorry i don’t know how to help just know that i can empathise. hopefully i have some wiser words in the future about this topic. but just know that for now, i think when we die we either just disappear or we all eventually go to heaven. this is just my belief. i cant imagine if afterlife exists for there to be a place of eternal hell it just does not feel right. although i am still not hundred percent on it but i am working on it ,as usual."
176072398,Not heard of this as a side-effect nor have I ever encountered anyone who had this as an issue.

176072401,"I remember my psychotic episodes. What terrorizes me is the memory, or lack of memory, of things I said and did when I was drunk. That is a common experience among alcoholics. In AA meetings they talk about things they did on a blackout that were horrifying when they found out they did them. There has been a couple of times I woke up in jail and had no idea what I did to end up there."
176072402,Have a psych nurse appt tomorrow. I am trying to prepare by noting the things I need support with. I have to always think ahead of conversations so I remember in the moment and so my thoughts can flow better. But I am having bad visions and also seeing things around me really bad. I am exhausted in every way. I can’t sleep. I feel bugs in bad ways. If I tell her the truth will she admit me against my will to the hospital? I do not have sz or sza but bipolar with schizotypal and gad
176072403,Too often my helpers seemed to be unwilling. But can you help being unwilling?
174360410,"My whole life I’ve been treated differently, and regarded as different and ‘bizarre’ (among other more hateful words) but no one believed I had sza/ was very surprised when I was diagnosed because I apparently articulate myself very well. So according to everyone around me being able to speak clearly and have a large vocabulary meant I didn’t have anything wrong with me (when in reality I can only do this because I read and wrote nonstop my entire childhood and teenage years), I was also able to show bursts of energy in social situations, though what everyone didn’t see was how stressed, anxious and fatigued I truly was, along with the paranoia that would completely destroy me the second I was alone. I was very different around people in public vs how I was when no one was around me, and I put on a front 24/7 bc I was so tired of people treating me cruelly and wanted to be seen as normal and function like a mentally healthy person. No one seemed to notice I only was able to be around them 
for a few hours at a time before I had to leave, that was about all I could really handle, and when I got to the point where I had my breakdown and became a full on agoraphobe everyone just told me I was lazy, and a liar, and I was just trying to get out of going to class, going to church and getting a job. For these reasons only a small handful of people in my life truly believed my diagnosis, while everyone else around me (including influential adult figures) told me I was doing it for attention or flat out said I was lying."
176072404,i aint ignorant i am woke. please refrain from saying such things in the future ok
176072405,"I don’t think you’re faking it. Personally for me, I have had delusions that come and go as part of the self-discovery part. Did I ever say anything that was factually false? Sure, why not. I don’t remember every thing I’ve said over the years. I said I went to Mars, but realized now it wasn’t real combined with the fact we live in some ET test-tube, petri-dish thing and I’ve only been abducted 10 times or so since I first woke up in my first life a long time ago (my first life). It’s sometimes hard to grasp what you are saying for the average person. Could be writing style or vocabulary. I think you should get a degree in philosophy or something since you enjoy it and are good at it. You come off honest in this thread. Sometimes what works for 1 person, doesn’t work for another, and vice versa. Conspiracy theories work for me. Some people gravitate towards them. I don’t really like the term ‘conspiracy theorist’ or ‘conspiracy theory’ because it’s a derogatory term as I 
have discovered some time back. People say it was invented by the government to discredit credible researchers."

174360415,Today has been rough for me. Staff where I live said I’ve been really needy and needing reassurance. I was utterly offended. Now I’m not going ask for any help. I’m going to do this myself. I just want to stay at home I dont want to be around others. The only trouble is is my nurse comes back next week and she sees the needy etc as she sees this as a sign I’m unwell. My pdoc over reacts too. I fear they will put me in hospital I just got out of a 13 week stay in hospital last week too. My pdoc also wants to up my clozapine but I had a seizure and they thought it could of been the meds.
176072409,On paper I was very intelligent. Got straight A’s and walked into a prestigious university. My common sense is ??????? awful

During classes I couldn’t relate things being talked about to what I was supposed to relate them to. I remember often I couldn’t decide whether I should look at the lecturer or at the slides being shown, while listening, suspecting my ability to comprehend what was being told could depend on that. Often the talk went in one ear and out the other, or didn’t enter my mind at all."

Moreover, patients with depressive, bipolar, and schizophrenic disorders all exhibited higher aHRs for development of both DVT and PE.The relative risks of DVT and PE were higher in patients with concurrent depressive, bipolar, and schizophrenic disorders than those of the general population.

176072430,"I don’t. I used to freak out about people asking me what I did for work. Now I feel like I’m comfortable with telling them I’m on disability but not what for. I would tell friends but I feel like even though I met these people in treatment I didn’t talk about it. My girlfriend knew, though not my fiance. I feel like if I’d told her than things would have been much easier in that relationship but I was in denial. I hate that it’s this huge thing you can’t talk about. I suppose that’s why this place is so nice to talk on."

176072440,"Also, when do you take your meds? If it’s in the morning, you might be feeling the withdrawal from the previous dose."
176072441,I think it has to do with the fact that you have a mental illness and when you are having a rough time you understand that you are hurting inside. Maybe you do things you regret but sometimes it’s related to your illness and you should get help. It’s more of a feeling that you are okay in your life and you are taking care of yourself.
176072442,"If anything is going to hurt you , it’s the panic that you’re causing yourself. Try to relax. As _AT_MENTION_ said, call your doctor if your heart is acting funny but most of all try to relax. The voices can’t hurt you."

176072446,"I was on wellbutrin, my pdoc said it can also give a boost in energy. I had a good experience when I was on it."
176072447,i think it bad behavior can be attributed to problems in the brain and maybe emotions due to circumstances in someones life
174360427,"What is working for me with it is finding my personal harmony with myself and taking better care of my health. I still have some occasional things I deal with but honestly for the most part things are very smooth because I do everything I can to feed the positives in life and make my environment a place I liek to be in. So much of my improvement has had less to do with my meds, and more to do with self care (and vitamins also). My Dr. even said self care was huge and agreed vitamins sometimes help."
176072448,Sounds like you need an adjustment. I would get in to see your doctor ASAP.
176072449,I have problems making friends outside of my family. I think my 11 year old niece really likes me. No pdoc will probably tell you but making friends is hard for schizo and that ability is often impared.
174360429,"The step from conspiracy theories and so on only applies to more mundane delusions such as persecutory ones. In those cases, one can argue that there is such a thing as a continuum between odd, irrational beliefs that vary only in degree of conviction from a mundane delusion. Where such a view has more serious problems is in the class of bizarre delusions, not too long ago a symptom that would place someone straight in the schizophrenia spectrum, excluding other delusional disorders. Delusions of this type include thought insertion and broadcasting, other delusions of control and solipsistic delusions. With these, making the case for an odd, but sub-delusional counterpart is a lot harder to make. What would be an intermediate step between movement experienced as-usual and the idea that someone else controls our limbs?"
176072450,I was forced to live without the ability to earn it and ended up in a state hospital. Psychosis isn’t really privilege. But I do see your point.
176072451,Ahh ok! Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! You’re the best.
176072452,So at the interview I mentioned i had an illness. It slipped out. I didn’t mention to anyone I didn’t know I could trust until last month. I think she may be spreading it. But wth I might as well be open now… They can’t kick me out it’s a government job. Or am I just trying to make myself feel less guilty for telling that one person.
174360426,"I don’t know If I understand, you suggest staying with solian 200 mg (morning) with clozapine 200 mg(night) and adding abilify which will decrease prolactin and help with libido? And if abilify helps with sexuality should I also put away convival (mood stabilizer)? i’ve never heard that abilify decrease prolactin when taking solian. But also, my sexuality isn’t fully disabled it’s just temporary disabled for about week when I feel better and it’s back like normal for about next week when my ill symptoms comes back. Also when taking stabilizer the libido is rather constant but cognition and memory goes back down and probably part of negatives comes back. Becouse i’m ill for about 5 years so I’ve been taking other drugs also olanzapine with abilify and as I wrote, before solian(year ago) none drug worked with my negatives and cognitiion. I also have been taking olanzapine with abilify and then my libido I remember was totally disabled. I’m pretty sure that the better memory and logica
l thinking are results of taking solian, maybe it depends on case of patient, in my case solian worked( but of course partialy). I appreciate your advice, maybe soon I will try it. I want also to ask about another medicine becouse i’ve heard that also good alternative for solian is (cariprazine) vraylar, quite new drug."
176072453,I suffered for many years without knowing what was wrong. I was too sensitive. Too shy. Too this or that. Really I was too paranoid and just because your not diagnosed doesn’t mean you can’t suffer from symptoms. Indeed most do before psychosis and diagnosis. It’s not the drug companies. Yeah they make oodles of money and psydocs do well but it’s grubby work. You never have your hands clean in this game so give your shrinks a break. Take the pills. It works for me and most!

I feel like I want to delete all my social media account so I won’t be attention seeker anymore but I aware this is false but still people will probably told me to “take you pills and it will go away” and leave me alone until it go away and I have to just sit there waiting this delusion to go away this is just my delusion but I’m so sorry for everything I did even tho I don’t really know If I did anything wrong I ca’nt stop thinking that everything is my fault I want to get myself out of this delusion sorry I really want to know how to coping without meds
176072459,"At least a few times a day I feel like the tv is talking about me or I go out and think people are indirectly talking about me. I think the internet articles have codes in them hidden for me, put there, to make me go crazy. I think I was conditioned for two years, by government agents, to think this way.

174360434,Yeah. I have that. I don’t think you realise the extent of my knowledge. I literally buzz with energy. And go back to having no ability to be awake bc of depressive symptoms. Others on the forum already know I’m juggling a job and a university place — that’s not very “schizophrenic” And to take the tone you’ve used. The way you’ve described it. It’s not at all as though they’re two absolutes and not diseases of the body. Really?

Which means while people in urban areas might see a therapist about anxiety or depression and stuff and get treated and go their merry way and not need any more treatment. People in the country may have a lingering mental illness.

No, I have no reduction in taste since being on ap’s. But there are good options on hand!

Then there is Braggs Liquid Aminos for saltiness, or, less healthy versions, soy sauces. Closely related there’s Worcestershire sauce which I’m sure you know about as a UK chap. Plenty of flavour. Does your brother cook from scratch? I do & despite SZ and ap’s I enjoy big, punchy flavours. I cook from scratch so can only recommend that your brother try that.

I didn’t think of it that way. Because I’m confused - isn’t it more negative symptoms I’m feeling? This avolition and apathy? And how does one tell difference between the depression and negative symptoms? I thought it was negative symptoms because I didn’t particularly feel sad or anything. But is he right? Is it more depression? Or both? I feel so helpless… maybe I have to take my full dose again… I can cope on 200mg amisulpride but if I relapse I take 400mg. I am reluctant to take full dose as it’s so expensive and so maybe 300mg can help? I seem to need to increase it more. It seems like all three of my meds help the depression not only olanzapine and Lamotrigine but amisulpride too. My voices and

Geodon and Latuda gave me with a single dose severe physical rage and I lost my freaking mind. I was 110 pounds and flipped a 200+ pound wooden 10 foot long table at a nurse. The ER had been told I couldn’t have that by my GP, and the nurse injected me anyway. The armed guards they put outside the little wooden door room in ER for people to grieve in (rural SD no psych rooms in ER) were taken back when I kicked the door hard enough to crack it. My husband was a CO for the jail there and they knew him, so they called him and told him what they gave me. He told them he was on his way and do not let them transport me across town in the cage without him being there. I didn’t flip the table until transported 30 mins across town in the cage _NAME_ and my husband was in the room when I did it. He got the 72 hour hold dropped next day (well si
nce it was 1am, he got my GP to get it dropped by 10am) and she threw a ??????? fit over their disregard for administering a drug I had an allergic reaction to.

He told me that “I cannot obtain peace until I overcome the barrier called “mom””. He told me to wait, remove myself from triggers, etc. If it gets worse, I am free to take meds. Things are hard. I had a horrible time trying to manage my hallucinations. They were choking me and killing me. But something stuck with me today. He told me, “You yourself are completely okay with everything, but you are now treating yourself like a monster because you are schizophrenic. You shouldn’t do that.” Anyway. Here is another journey.

That was a delusion. And the mental state I was in was destroying my mind I couldn’t sleep because of how active my brain was and I struggled to calm myself. I believed falling asleep would kill me as I knew myself and I would transcend to the next reality. I however have a deep fear of death and this kept me from falling asleep. This was all a delusion. The fact that my mental state could become so warped had never occured to me, I was implicitly trusting my mind to function without fault and I had never thought that it would actively thwart my reasoning.

174360487,"I’m sorry youre still suffering like this _AT_MENTION_ . You were very brave to try Clozapine. I’m sorry that didn’t work out. Maybe you could try speaking to your doctor about high dose Olanzapine? That’s probably what I’d do if I was in your situation. pharmacokinetic aspects alone cannot account for why the disease may sometimes be resistant to 20mg of olanzapine but respond to higher doses. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Use of very-high-dose olanzapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Nov 2014 Schizophrenia is a chronic illness with a progressive course that can be marked by resistance to antipsychotic treatment. This can make therapeutic support challenging for the practitioner, with results that are partial and unsatisfactory. In the literature, treatment with high-dose olanzapine (>20mg/day) appears to be a good alternative to clozapine, the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizo
phrenia. In the present observational prospective study, we studied the clinical and biological profiles of patients treated with olanzapine doses up to 100mg/day. In total, 50 patients were clinically and biologically assessed. We found a linear relationship between oral dose and serum concentration (Pearson's r=0.83, p<0.001) with effects of tobacco (p<0.05) and of coffee and tea consumption (p<0.01). Tolerance seemed to be good regardless of dose. No link was found between concentration and efficiency. Despite a nonexhaustive assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters, not least pharmacogenetic data (e.g., genotyping of cytochrome P450-1A2 or glycoprotein P Abcb1a), pharmacokinetic aspects alone cannot account for why the disease may sometimes be resistant to 20mg of olanzapine but respond to higher doses. A nuclear imaging study exploring brain occupancy by high-dose olanzapine, coupled with the abovementioned pharmacokinetic assessment, may prove a relevant experimental paradigm for studying the pathophysi
ological mechanisms of resistant schizophrenia."

174360494,"Hello, firstly I want to warn about my english it isn’t perfect, but what I want to talk about Is the curing effects of drug named solian. I started taking it about year ago exactly 400 mg of it and 200 mg of clozapine within this time I suffered many negative symptoms, I was afraid to go out side, I lacked motivation of doing anything from simple home responsibilities to things like looking for job, I couldn’t find common language with other people I felt this inside emptiness of emotions, and I had more negative symptoms, like attacks of afraid when trying to do some responsibilities. But then my faith suddenly changed, when I started to take less dose of Solian, exactly 200 mg, I started to feel this inside motivation to do things, and responsibilities, I stoped to feel afraid of it, and also I started to find myself comfortable in contacts with another people. This inside emptiness dissapeared. I even occasional started to feel to motivated, but it wasn’t anyway big problem. Also my memor
y started to work very fine while when before I always have been forgetting many things and had memory problems. Also I improved my rational mind, what I want to say, is that I started to be britght like more intelligent, it felt like I finally started to use my brain. But after two weeks I again started to feel bad, this all negative symptoms which I described before returned, I was confused I was searching for the cause of this situation. But then after some times the situation repeated. I started to feel good and healthy again. With time I realized that those healing effects of solian last for about week and something about next week I feel again bad. And also that its connected with my sex desire, exactly my sex desire starts to get strong at the week when I feel ill, and i’m becoming to have exactly zero of sex desire when I feel again healthy. After about five months of such a situation, My doctor suggested to start using a mood stabilizer to gain a constant sex desire and since 5 months i’m taking 
250mg morning and 250 mg night of convival chrono, I think valproinian acid. When I take it all the time I have the sex desire but my inteligence and memory are weak, and I lack of motivation and I’m not very talkative. When I don’t take the stabilizer about twice in week I again have this alternating mood, like I’m talkative one week and more like logical thinking but my memory still Is very weak without sex desire, but the next week i’m in worse mood i’m not to bright and I have sex desire, and for now I’m continuing with this state. What I want to gain with this post is to get any advice, and I know that probably it would be difficult to find someone with pretty similar situation. But I had to try, maybe someone feel to have experience enough to try to help me."

176072690,"I’m sorry about your moms health _AT_MENTION_ . I’ve had cancer in my family members too. I hope your mom improves. But to get back to the subject of schizophrenia, I’ve seen too many miracles for people with schizophrenia to give up on my own life and other peoples lives. I’ve had people who I knew through vocational programs or support groups etc. who I would swear would never get a girlfriend or a job and I lose touch with them for several years only to run into them and find out they got a job and worked for several years or they had a steady girlfriend for awhile or did some other great thing in life. Never say never. It’s cool if you’ve come to terms with not being employed. I’ve seen miracles but there is also wisdom in knowing your limitations and there is wisdom in knowing when to back off and accept that you need to let something go that you can’t do and turn your energy elsewhere. It’s a fine line between perseverance and intelligently surrendering. (surrendering does n
ot have to have a negative connotation, it can be a good thing). Personally, I have been very lucky when it comes to being employed and living independently and a few other things. Because luck plays a big part in recovery. Sometimes (relative) success is just being in the right place at the right time. I’ve stumbled onto jobs that I was able to do very good at and lasted years at. I never knew at the beginning if I would do good at them but after a few months I find that I can do the work and I end up staying there for years. The disgraced _NAME_ once said, “90% of success is just showing up.” And that’s what I’m good at. I hope this whole answer isn’t a convoluted mess. It’s just stuff that I’ve picked up over the years. Personally, at age 58, I am winding down in life. I know there’s a few guys on here older than me and I hope to live that long too and I haven’t given up by a longshot. But a big priority for me now is personal growth. I see other people of every age who have confidence 
and people on here sometimes complain they have no confidence but I still see they have more personal confidence than I’ve ever had. In AA, members say about other peoples good recovery, “I see what they got and I want it.” So I see people with confidence and I want a little myself. So I hate to derail this thread but that is my goal. I’ve achieved it a little. Anyways, I’ll leave you with this last sliver of my experience. Lots of times, other people can see potential in us that we don’t see in ourselves. I have lived this endless times. It’s often how I got jobs and accomplished a lot of things in life. It could happen to anybody."

Just started maybe 2 months ago. It worked well for a month or so and now my symptoms are back and really strong. I’m pretty suicidal. I’m tired of everything.

I have no voices and no hallucinations. Just beliefs. Therefore I am not schizophrenic. I’ve had psychosis sure, but that was a result of prolonged depression and isolation. Also my other episodes were probably caused by the poisonous antipsychotics disrupting my brain chemistry. I still hope I can become God one day and destroy the reptilians. Maybe destroy all sentient life. This universe should be mine."

I gained weight on seroquel but once I stopped taking that I lost the weight back. A lot of the old antipsychotics don’t cause weight gain but they have worse movement symptoms.

176072736,its not uncommon. We overthink things a lot. Seeing the negative side of things is almost a protective mechanism for risk decisions. I tend to do it too much as well. I talk myself out of too many things.

176072751,"The site is English speaking, but I’d say we have a good mix of people from all over. Like _AT_MENTION_ said, I think the large US representation is mostly due to the large US population size, and the time of day you visit. In the middle of the night US time, there are almost entirely Europeans on here. The reason we don’t communicate in another language is because the site was founded by an English speaker, who in the beginning had to do most of the oversight on their own English is the most common second language for non-native speakers, and many native English speakers don’t have a fluent second language. So we can reach the most people in English. All the staff currently speak English, but our second languages are quite different, so if we communicated in say, French, German, Spanish, etc, it would all be up to only one of the mods to review those posts, and that’s a lot of pressure for one person. Occasionally people do make posts in other languages, and we use google translate for wha

Almost three months ago, my pdoc decided it was time to try something new, so we settled on Zyprexa. I did well on it back in 1996-97 so it seemed an obvious choice. It’s been my miracle drug. I am no longer unstable and paranoid, and I am looking for a full-time job to get off disability. I am going to start volunteering as a transition if I get my own car this weekend. My pdoc wants to find the lowest effective dose, so I have been at 7.5 mg for a little while and I’m still doing very well. Looks like 7.5 mg is my dose. We both expected 15-20 mg because I was on such a high dose of Haldol, but we’re pleasantly surprised. Good luck with your own med change! I hope this helped."

Have you noticed any other signs of destabilization that your doctor needs to know about? Was there a trigger for this concern? Other than that I don’t have any advice for this worry other than worrying about having a delusion might not mean anything at all other than that’s what your mind chose to be anxious about, and that’s okay. It doesn’t always need figuring out. If you can get to a point where you can help yourself feel okay then that’s all that matters. I wish you well!"

174360535,Me too I feel a rush of energy before taking my meds and sleep at night. I think its the dopamine rush that makes me feel like this and meds stop this rush because I lose the energy after taking meds. I would rather take meds and loose that energy (negative symptoms) than having positive symptoms and psychosis which are more dangerous.

176072818,"So in terms of the TV saying what you think or say – is it possible that it’s less that you are dictating the content and more that many people think similar ideas and concepts? As an example, I had been thinking about dualism and non-dualism, and around that time was re-watching the _PERSON_. Remember that wonderful scene with the poisoned goblets? In essence, that is a battle between dualism (which cup has the poison) and non-dualism (haha, they both do). Now, is it that my thinking of the difference between dualism and non-dualism re-wrote _NAME_s novel and script across time to reflect what I was thinking of, or that in line with _PERSON_’s seven basic stories and the universality of narrative elements that the many-thousand year old thinking about dualism and non-duality was simply present in multiple forms of stories and concepts, and my thinking on the subject sensitized me to recognize those things in the stories around me? I was really struggling with some of my thought loops when I 
was holding tightly to the idea that “I am special.” It’s understandable, as in line with the solipsism idea and the reductive aspect of _PERSON_’ logic “I exist” is pretty much the basest assumption we can make, but “you exist” requires a much greater array of assumptions, so clearly “I am important” is an easier conclusion to come to than “you are important.” But ultimately, I enjoy TV, books, movies, video games, etc all far too much to want to live in a universe where I and only I create things. I genuinely love experiencing other people’s ideas and imaginations. So I decided I’d prefer to live in a world where other people exist too, and so I’d assume that they do even if I couldn’t “know” it (because really, even “I think therefore I am” was overstepping the boundaries - we can’t really know we are generating the thoughts we perceive, only that we observe them, so “I observe therefore I am” is a more accurate foundational assumption, but a somewhat depressin
g one to remain with). It wasn’t a leap from there to let go of feeling that “I” was important to feeling that “we” are important. Like - if you could choose, would you really want to be the sole savior of humanity? That’s a lot of responsibility and stress and headache. Do you really want to be “the greatest” _PERSON_ alive, or maybe it’d be more fun to be “a pretty great” _PERSON_ as one of many great living enlightened minds with whom you could discuss and debate ideas to better define and shape your own. Certainly if you are coming from the Eastern traditions, isn’t that the whole point of the Yin and the Yang instead of a singular force? By a nondualist foundational entity embracing the illusion of dualism it can better know and develop itself, right? Solipsism takes the stance that the illusion is that others exist. But perhaps the illusion is that the “ego” itself, and the idea that we are separate from others. Or, perhaps in the non-dualist sense, both are equally true and 
equally fictitious, and there’s value in both perspectives."

It’s why i hated that in the psych wards it was different pdocs than the one you usually have cause they have to learn to get to know you and in the psych ward the visits were always a lot shorter than the visit at your regular pdoc.

When they are not filtered, though, the unconscious thoughts appear as voices? The images that we get from external sources are stimuli interpreted by the brain through the eye. When these internal unconscious images are not filtered by the brain, they appear as visual hallucinations? Cognitive decline happens because the brain is a muscle. Say, with depression, one cannot focus. The brain loses it’s ability to function, more and more, as the person is unable to focus. This effects the various Executive functions. With the voices and the visual hallucinations, the person becomes unable to focus externally on anything productive. He is in his own world. Hence, there is gradual cognitive decline in Schizophrenia? I mean at the end of the day it may just be a filtering problem at an unconscious level. Is this an interesting proposition?"
176072922,"College was an alright experience, I am glad I graduated."
176072923,Which one? No. I think it was pure psychosis. I wasn’t aware of my surroundings
176072924,"BPD can cause transient psychotic symptoms under stress. Schizotypal can also cause transient or subclinical psychotic symptoms. Schizoid generally does not cause psychotic symptoms. From your OP it sounds like BPD could be a possibility, since your psychotic symptoms come when something triggers you."

176072927,"I would appreciate your experiences with any medications. How long did you try them for, for example? And which side effects are the most to least intolerable to you. What medications, including vitamins and supplements do you take daily at this point? Thanks, _NAME_"
176072928,"Thanks jassy, thats what im trying to think. Im disabled with a mental illness so they arent coercing me. Just to add, there are many things i like about the u.s. canada is its ally. I avoid certain documentaries bc ive accepted that knowing more doesnt help me. Its not like im born into a rich family, harvard educated and destined to run in politics lol. Ive seen zeitgeist the movie years ago and that was too triggering. So was stuff about cia lsd experimentation. They screwed over their own cia agent in that documentary. Anyway, i avoid conspiracy movies. No use or benefit to me."
176072929,"Hopefully you get better. I had something similar but maybe more extreme while off meds, catatonia. I freeze completely without eye movements for several minutes, I feel like my heart and emotions stop, complete emptyness. My parents hit and yell at me I didn’t respond. I was out of reality."

176072931,"That’s great, Pianogal! I’m happy for you."
176072932,"I’ve noticed this a lot in trauma survivorsl. When they start to listen to their gut again, they end up being hypersensitive to the natural cues of the world. Partly because their experience with trauma helps them recognize patterns more quickly, as a survival mechanism. Sometimes also partly because they got so used to ignoring danger cues to survive their trauma that they feel more connected to such cues now that they can listen to them again. Does that sound at all relatable to you?"
176072933,I’m not sure. I always took it at night. I was a little spacey the first month and then fine after that.
176072934,"Way i see it, my illness is blessing because i learn sympathy, empathy towards people with similar situations and learn connect with people. I dont see as curse at all but i still have lots of learning to do, you stop learning though."

176072941,Welcome to the club.
176072942,i worry about the last few posts if she is ok or not
176072943,"Last week I missed my follow-up appointment with my medical doctor because I accidentally fell asleep for a few minutes and was a little late in getting there and the ladies up front didn’t want the doctor to miss her lunch rightfully. So they had me reschedule for today. So I have to do it all over again. First I have to take a bath and get all presentable which is stressful. Then I have to leave the house, which is stressful. Then I have to drive over there, which is stressful, because it’s off a busy road and I can never remember where to turn and there’s always someone riding my ass. Then I have to be friendly and do paperwork. Which is stressful. And finally have an exchange with the doctor. The whole thing is so overwhelming to me. I don’t handle stress very well. Something as simple as a doctor’s appointment is just a pile of stress to me. Why can’t I just be normal."
176072944,"They’re all questionable after the fact lol, but yeah I’ve had some"
176072945,And who tells you that?
176072946,That’s great! It reminds me of a stained glass window in a church or something.
176072947,Oh. I’m sorry. That sounds like a horrible boss
176072948,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !!! I’m in a group to learn life skills that I think may help my PTSD so all is not lost. I think I’m more understanding of people’s emotional and mental pain as a result.

176072951,Hey _NAME_ i apologize if i seemed harsh with you. I thought something is missing thats why i asked you twice if you take any meds. My advice for you is try to exercise to get rid of these negative thoughts you have. Peace
176072952,I have a pain in my right calf and my big toe is numb and my foot and ankle is swollen.
176072953,I would say a higher power is looking out for me because a lot has gone right when times were tough.
176072954,"Maybe it could be possible for yourself and a safe friend or case worker visit _NAME_ headwaters in your country and you can ask them all the questions you like to gain insight that the government is not following you or tampering with you in anyway and if they had those skills, they would most likely be solving crimes of national security rather than harassing an I’ll innocent person such as yourself. Even with all the government precautions crimes go unnoticed everyday even major international ones slip through the cracks, some are caught through customs, border security eat and others are undetected. Why would they hound you continuously if they can’t even solve all the real crimes from real criminals. It’s definitely a delusion. I feel for you. Your not alone. Maybe going to them and asking for 10min of their time and asking with supervision may help you put these feelings to rest. Or maybe speak to your Dr if your on meds."
176072955,"I don’t believe I’m on tv, I believe the tv is talking to me and talking about my thoughts and broadcasting my thoughts. It’s so unbelievable and uncomfortable. I have no privacy and I’m trying to figure out how everywhere I go people know who I am and they have never seen me. I’m trying to see how I am on camera or a microphone. I can’t find it. I have even took a _NAME_ pin and stuck it all the way down my ears and couldn’t find anything."
176072956,My voices are like that too. My nurse practitioner keeps asking me what the voices are saying. I say they go on about a lot of things. I tell them ????.
176072957,LOL I just realised that there shouldn’t be a hyphen in ‘no one’ - I never was that good at grammer
176072958,Soccer is good. It’s a team sport. You have to integrate and work with others. It’s uber aerobic. You need to be really fit and that type of fitness is really good for the heart. If your struggling change it up and try something different.
176072959,I lost my physical ability to excercise too I don’t enjoy it n can’t do it properly anymore I am really not happy about that

176072971,"Cool, thanks. Heh."
176072972,I like what _AT_MENTION_ said. That people come in all different flavors. Some people would think I’m selfish because I’m shy and don’t talk much. I’ve tried to talk more. It’s not my flavor and I don’t enjoy it. My mom and aunt on the other hand love to talk. It doesn’t necessarily mean they’re selfish. Some would rather talk others would rather listen.
176072973,"See thats the thing I hate most about this disease, you have to gauge off of others most times, cuz its hard to realize where to fit in and sometimes people tell you things about what your doing or about things you did and you have to trust it wasnt said fro their own intentions.

176072974,Part time with disability myself. But I cant work full time.
176072975,For you night owls.
174360580,"IDK. At the ten year mark of having schizophrenia in 1989 when I was 28 or 29, I was in the middle of a nasty relapse. I was addicted to crack, broke, unemployed and lost my housing so I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor in a small room in a family friends apartment. My whole life was a really, really, bad situation. I was hospitalized or sent to an evaluation room several times at that period. The thought of giving up had to have crossed my mind but I sure don’t remember if it did. I wasn’t living at that time, just existing. I had every reason to give up but I just kept going. I had no friends except the family friend and he was in his sixties so except for going out to coffee occasionally we didn’t hang out. And my days consisted of sleeping in and then getting up after my dad went to work and eating and then staying inside most of the day. Some days I went out but usually only for either for a walk or to the video store. And life was boring and miserable and painful. _NAME_ had a gr
eat quote that pretty much describes most of my life and especially my initial psychosis and my relapse. “When you’re going through hell, keep going.” And that’s what I did. And one day my dad told me, “Why don’t you go out and get a job.” So I went out and found a job recycling cans and bottles which involved working by myself. It didn’t last so I got another job in a warehouse. It was quite far away and I didn’t hate the whole job but I certainly wasn’t happy with it. But a couple people were friendly to me. I ended up walking out of the job site at lunch break and never returning. I was a hell of a irresponsible person at that time. I really didn’t care about a lot of things that as an adult, I should have. But yadda, yadda, yadda. I smoked crack some more, I had another job, moved around a bit and ended up in a group home at age 30. But I got clean there. I got a job. I made a few friends. Got a girlfriend. Then the next step was living in another board & care home for 5 years. Durin
g my stay I worked the entire time and attended college. I did quite a few fun and social things during my stay. When I wasn’t working or going to school I was out doing things with a friend there. Now I’m 58. The result of not giving up is that now I live pretty independently, I have a great car, a nice apartment, I have a chunk of money in the bank, I have no debt, I work, take online classes, and take care of business and now I can afford to have some entertainment. I think I will get better. It sure seems like it. I don’t know about everybody else but if I think I can’t win than I will surely not win. And the contrary is true too: If I think I can win, than a lot of the time I will win."
176072976,Sending positive vibes your way _AT_MENTION_
176072977,"Hi _AT_MENTION_, I’ve just read this thread and would like to say I understand how you must be feeling, at least a little bit. Last summer, my dear wife who is 54 told me about how she was sexually assaulted when she was 11 and coming home from school one day. Her parents were splitting up at the time and her home life was in turmoil so she never told anyone ever about it until she told me one night last summer. My wife’s journey through life has been a genuine struggle with all kinds of twists and turns but she kept up with the struggle sometimes winning and sometimes losing and so often being exhausted but she kept trying with her bruised soul. My wife makes me think of you. By the way she has learned a lot about herself and figured a lot out after her disclosure to me last summer. I suspect more and more will make sense as you discuss your experiences with your trusted support worker. Best of everything on your journey."
176072978,You can go to some for quite a long time
176072979,_AT_MENTION_ I just sent you mine thru private message
176072980,"Well, I tended to think like that because I had ill tempered parents. Kids are always getting into trouble and if they’re not corrected in a kind way, they easily get the idea they are bad people."
176072981,I depend on people for my happiness. We are social creatures. Isn’t that normal?
176072982,"Not really. I was only diagnosed 2 years ago, already in my 40s, but all my life I’ve failed to be normal, or at least to deceive others into believing that I was."
176072983,It would be nice to have the choice of turning down the vaccine rather than having to wait until close to winter as our PM is an incompetent pudstick who screwed up procurement like he has every other file he’s touched. I would like to be vaccinated already. I’ve spent my entire life being kept alive by cutting edge medical tech and am not overly concerned. My daughter would also like to be vaccinated. You should be worried about them getting COVID. They can spend their entire lives with brain damage if they’re among the young it causes to get microstrokes from increased blood clotting.

Especially they ‘They can’t read my thoughts’ thought, like today I thought this at a person at work and they literally turned right around and looked me right in my eyes and started saying something in reference to something I’ve been thinking about often. It was like he was a robot.” –** “People around me visually react (it’s not me making an assumption of whether they could ‘hear’ me or not) – they physically contort themselves (their faces, their actions, what they say) in ways that would affirm that they are indeed aware that they can pick up my thoughts as I think them.” – Source: Mentalhealthforum 2). **I can’t believe humanity is actually in the dark about a phenomenon that is absolutely real and basically the most interesting thing we have come across so far as a species (in my opinion, of course).

I got out of the shuttle and walked around the parking lot trying to stop crying. They weaned me off seroquel and the akathisia began to go away.

174360607,Nice question. Personality disorders are deeper in the brain and are more difficult to treat but they don’t cause disability like schizophrenia. Sometimes they are just a way of living.

174360616,"I don’t know about us having lower IQ’s. Maybe, because it took me 30 years just to learn how to spell IQ. As to “incurable”, I think it depends on your criteria for claiming someone is cured. I’ve heard some people say they have no symptoms anymore but they say they still need medication. That doesn’t sound “cured” to me. I want to believe it’s curable but I’ve never seen an example of being “cured” that satisfies me that someone has recovered completely. I think the nature of the disease is that just having psychosis for any long period of time does irreparable damage or alters the brain so that the damage is done and that in turn stops a person from being totally functioning. One way I might put it is that our growth as well- functioning adults is stunted by having schizophrenia and we don’t develop as we should. I’m not saying we can’t accomplish anything, because that’s ridiculous. Just examples on this site shows we can do all kinds of things. Personally I got

176073105,"A List of Executive Functions With this example as a base, let’s turn back to the question of what specific abilities are covered under the umbrella term of executive functioning. Below is the list of executive functions from Dr. _PERSON_ and his colleagues. We’ve included a specific illustration of each executive function from our case study of _NAME_ in parentheses after each definition. Inhibition - The ability to stop one’s own behavior at the appropriate time, including stopping actions and thoughts. The flip side of inhibition is impulsivity; if you have weak ability to stop yourself from acting on your impulses, then you are “impulsive.” (When Aunt Sue called, it would have made sense to tell her, “Let me check the calendar first. It sounds great, but I just need to look at everybody’s schedules before I commit the whole family.”) Shift - The ability to move freely from one situation to another and to think flexibly in order to respond appropriately to the situation. (When th
e question emerged regarding who would watch the cats, _NAME_ was stymied. Her husband, on the other hand, began generating possible solutions and was able to solve the problem relatively easily.) Emotional Control - The ability to modulate emotional responses by bringing rational thought to bear on feelings. (The example here is _NAME_’s anger when confronted with her own impulsive behavior in committing the family before checking out the dates: “Why are you all being so negative?”) Initiation - The ability to begin a task or activity and to independently generate ideas, responses, or problem-solving strategies. (_NAME_ thought about calling to check on the date of the reunion, but she just didn’t get around to it until her husband initiated the process.) Working memory - The capacity to hold information in mind for the purpose of completing a task. (_NAME_ could not keep the dates of the reunion in her head long enough to put them on the calendar after her initial phone call from _PERSON_ Sue.) Plan
ning/Organization - The ability to manage current and future- oriented task demands. (In this case, _NAME_ lacked the ability to systematically think about what the family would need to be ready for the trip and to get to the intended place at the intended time with their needs cared for along the way.) Organization of Materials - The ability to impose order on work, play, and storage spaces. (It was _NAME_’s job to organize the things needed for the trip. However, she just piled things into the car rather than systematically making checklists and organizing things so important items would be easily accessible, so the space would be used efficiently, and so that people and “stuff” would be orderly and comfortable in the car.) Self-Monitoring - The ability to monitor one’s own performance and to measure it against some standard of what is needed or expected. (Despite the fact that they’re off to Missouri without knowing how to get there, with almost no planning for what will happen along the way, and 
without a map, _NAME_ does not understand why her husband is so upset.) The executive functions are a diverse, but related and overlapping, set of skills. In order to understand a person, it is important to look at which executive skills are problematic for her and to what degree. http://www.ldonline.org/article/29122/"

176073112,"Every so often I will wake up with my heart absolutely pounding. Without fail I’ll have just had a nightmare involving my brother taking his life or something along similar lines. We don’t often talk, but first time it happened I dreamed he jumped. I called him right away. At 2am. Before I could tell him about the dream, he told said he was STILL stuck at work because a man was trying to jump off a bridge. The odds of that happening right as I dreamed it are ASTRONOMICALLY low. Something caused me to pick up on my brothers thoughts. This time I dreamed I was having a nightmare. Spirits or some unseen force was causing sleep paralysis. I cried in bed until finally I could scream to get my moms attention. The scream was a whisper. Eventually I was able to move and got out of bed. I started walking towards mom’s room but ended up downstairs looking for my brother. He was sitting at the table. I told him I dreamed his best friend was dead. He dismissed me for a while before deciding to just show 
me. In this dream his best friend lived with us, so my brother lead me down to our finished basement. Only when we got down there he turned right back around. Before he started hurrying me back upstairs, I saw his buddy’s legs poking out from behind the sofa. I knew it. His friend was dead. I asked my brother how he knew his friend wasn’t just drunk or sleeping. My brother didn’t answer me. Instead he pushed me all the way to my mom’s room. She was startled when we woke her and pissed when I told her those spirit things were tormenting me. Eventually she decided to say that maybe they were trying to warn us but that it was too late. My brother sat crying as the realization set in. Then I woke up. WHY. A dream in a dream is no doubt a very bad sign. Plus the spirit things are in my waking life. Why would they be in a dream too if not trying to communicate with me. Are they trying to tell me something? Do they know I know about them? If so they will hurt me. Or kill me. They’ve told me in the past tha
t they’d kill me and make it look like an undeniable suicide. I know they’re powerful enough to do it. And now I am actually terrified. I don’t want to upset them more and this is exactly the kind of thing that will do that. I sent a message to my brother because I’m too scared to make any noise right now. He hasn’t responded yet. I’m too scared to get my SO in the other room. I don’t want to get hurt. There is one sniffing around for me right now. I have to make myself think normal thoughts so I’m going to go now."

176073118,"for a lot of reasons I think a key to my recovery. Or moreso a “result” that is very key is that when I talk to people I have an opinion. Before I was more influenceable and naïve and listened to everything I was told I feel. Now I take a stand and give them my insights. Unless it better suits the situation to not give them my insights. Then I usually abstain. Human interaction is a wonder. You can never fully prepare yourself for human interaction. There is always going to be new scenarios. But maybe if you can use your brain as you should be able to, and have experiences too, then you can make an appropriate decision. I know ive always struggled because my brain hadn’t caught up with my experiences. Now my brain is catching up to my experiences I feel. So I could more so be myself. I used to believe everything what people told me about myself. Now I say “Wait are they right or are they wrong?” Sometimes theyre right, sometimes theyre wrong. But I can distinguish better now.

But where are all these people who have been “cured”? I believe in improvement but excuse me if I’m cynical about “success stories” of people who have been “cured” . I’m as optimistic as the next guy but every time someone says they are cured it turns out they still take medication. If they are “cured” why do they need medication? See what I mean? I guess it would help if there was a universal definition of cured. The next most popular claim of someone who says their cured is the person who announces, “Yeah, I’m cured, I haven’t had symptoms in a year.” Does a year really prove anything? And in a related claim, the people who say, “I’m cured, I haven’t had positive symptoms in a year or two.” Now that’s great, but many people achieve that (to a degree) but part of schizophrenia is negative symptoms. And depending on 
your definition of “cured” I would think no negative symptoms + high functioning would be criteria for claiming you are cured. Of course I want to be cured. I just have seen too many flaws in the cases of people who say they are cured."

176073139,I’m on zyprexa and have been more thirsty after i started medicating. I noticed that the severity of thirst depends on what dose of medication i take. When I was on 20mg I would have like a desert mouth all the time and felt very thirsty. Now I’m on 5mg. I still get thirsty at night and need a glass of water on my nightstand. I coincidentaly also noticed that days I have skipped medication for whatever reason I am not thirsty at night and could sleep through the night whitout getting thirsty. I doubt diabetes is a factor in my case.

Ive gotten tired of dealing with the paranoia and hallucinations recently so I will be going back on them soon. I was working in a hospital as a nursing assistant and was going to school for nursing-I would like to become a psych nurse one day. When I was on meds in the past I was always worried about coworkers being able to tell I was on some type of psych med and turning on me because of that.

But I’m worried if I brought that upon myself then it wouldn’t be justified. But I and my family really think I have struggled with these mental issues enough that I didn’t bring it all upon myself. I struggled with these things even before I started abusing adderall. I hope God understands my struggles and the reasons why I held back from moving away and I hope that is enough.
174360637,"I feel like, in this day and age, there’s no excuse for forgetting your meds often enough to destabilize you. Like, I get that sometimes, things happen and we miss a dose, but destabilization? That takes, at the very least, several days of not taking any AP, mood stabilizer, whatever. We have phones, computers, old fashioned alarm clocks, pill boxes, etc. Plus, they’re your freaking meds. You have schizophrenia. These meds are literally preventing your brain from destroying itself. Why do you think that doctors willingly prescribe us medications that cause, among other things, extreme weight gain, extreme drowsiness, diabetes, high prolactin levels, and low white blood cell count? They know that they’re dangerous. They’re just not as dangerous as psychosis. You said you spend most of your time on the computer, right? Keep your meds and some water right by the computer and set alarms on your computer for each time you take your meds and what meds to take at each time. I’m not trying to be 
a bi tch, it’s just that meds this important are rather difficult to truly forget about. I know that, in the past, I would say that I “forgot” my meds when really I just didn’t want to take them. I have to ask if that’s what’s going on here, because if so, then it needs to stop, not just for your sake, but for the sake of your family and friends as well."

Do you think the peasants and homeless people would often dream of unknown food in the past? It seems like they may have dreamed of stuff that may not have been invented yet in their hunger dreams. Got me thinking if its possible that there is dream food from the future in our dreams. I wonder if itll be true. It was fun to think about.

176073180,Would it bother you if they were? I wouldn’t worry about it. Most people are preoccupied with their own lives and wouldn’t have the time or the interest to watch you. I used to be really paranoid and thought my house was bugged and it bothered me for years. But eventually you get to the point where you don’t care anymore. Let them watch. The tv isn’t talking about you unless you’re famous. That’s a delusion. TV used to trigger me really bad. Especially the news. That gets better with time too. I still don’t watch the news but I am better with it.

If I try to run my heart rate goes through the roof. Maybe you won’t have that with just Latuda though. Be careful going off Geodon though. It’s rough. Big withdrawals along with symptoms. Hopefully you are gradually decreasing it.

In any case, it doesn’t sound like he’s very good at his job, and even though it’s irritating, I wouldn’t take it personally. I’m saying these things as someone who has a problem with taking things personally, so it’s something I think a lot about. I’m glad you ended up getting your food after all.

So I kept coming back. Started coming once in a while and then started coming a little more. And soon I was on here once a week for an hour until now I’m here every day, several times a day.

It’s so long ago.” I don’t know, mom- I wish I knew. Most of all, I’m just scared of people. PTSD is a scary thing… So I’ve made this plan: work myself till I get tired.

174360659,"i think it is a immue system reaction to the fungal infection that cause some abnormality in our brain. Why would i say so because i have sinusitis , not a severe one though , and most of the time sinusitis are caused by fungi, and most importantly, sinuses are located beside the brain and it can definitely carry the substancec via near tissues , Also , sometimes in my eyes i would see some small ,very tiny “snakes” and i know “ they”are in my eyes , at first i think they are “floaters” but actually they are so vivid , and really look like have life, so i found out they actually look the same, and these are fungi that could be fungi living floating in my eyes and i “see” them, right? Why i would rebut that’s more than just “ floaters” because most likely of the time u see black dots/white dots when u experience them, and i did but what i saw are actually quite lively (though in small amount), and with the match of the shape /appearance,which makes me believe that what i actual
ly have been seeing could be “fungi” that crawls around from my sinus to near tissues like eyes/brain etc and trigger the immue response micmic psychosis. Also , another evidence is that Niacin and vitamin d are actually claimed to help some schizophrenia patients and what’s common between them is that they have anti-fungal effect , and i think it is more than coincidence. Overall , i just think fungi infection could be related with psychosis or u may say: that’s all delusions, who knows?

174360674,"Like ninjastar said - not really understood. However they are working on understanding the biology of specific symptoms like voices. To investigate the biological origins of hearing “voices” in patients with schizophrenia, a team led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai used ultra-high field imaging to compare the auditory cortex of schizophrenic patients with healthy individuals. They found that schizophrenic patients who experienced auditory hallucinations had abnormal tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex. Tonotopy is the ordered representation of sound frequency in the auditory cortex, which is established in utero and infancy and which does not rely on higher-order cognitive operations. The study findings, which appears this week in the Nature Partner Journal NPJ Schizophrenia , suggest that the vulnerability to develop “voices” is probably established many years before symptoms begin. ScienceDaily The propensity to hear 'voices' in Schizophrenia may be 
established by infancy Findings reveal how auditory hallucinations may arise in patients with schizophrenia and provide potential new targets for early detection and treatment."

176073367,"I’d rather bottle one. But seriously, I lived in a nice studio with my cat for 7 years. The trouble started within two weeks. The lady who lived below me always sounded like she was moving furniture around. It was annoying and unfortunately I took it personal and thought she was doing it to bug me. I couldn’t hear her walking around and rarely could I hear her talking. But those goddam mysterious thumps and bumps drove me crazy. Undoubtedly some of it was my imagination but it happen enough to really piss me off and I used to stomp on my floor. She complained to management. Now the thing was, that it was a big complex and I knew not everybody liked me but some of them did like me. I was on really good terms with the sweet old lady two doors down. We exchanged cards and gifts on holidays. There was a language barrier; she didn’t speak any English but somehow we communicated for 7 years. I was in my forties and I also was friends with the guy down the hall who was my age. I was on good terms wi
th several other people. But bad terms with others. But problems with neighbors aside, it was cool living alone sometimes, in fact, a lot of times. There was a supermarket across the street and. a Rite-Aid and those both suited my needs for shopping. IDK, living alone was horrible sometimes. I tended to isolate. But I took care of myself pretty good. I managed my own money and took care of my car and kept my studio clean. I took my cat to the vet when needed and went to all my doctors appointments. I mean I’m schizophrenic and sometimes symptoms hindered me in what I wanted to do. But despite that I handled anything that came up. It was just problems with the lady downstairs and a few other people. Eventually it got too bad and I moved out after seven years. I made a lot of mistakes but my sister tried to help me and she would tell me I was imagining things. But she also often told me that I was doing a lot of things right. I don’t know how I lasted 7 years. I have my doubts that now at age 60 I could do 
it again.Who knows?"

176073391,There are those that live as Gods with little care or empathy for others. There are the demigods so concerned with power that cruelty and sadism pervades their very pores. There are humans that see every realm but experience them only mildly. There is the animal realm only concerned with food and survival. There are the hungry ghosts concerned with the desire for ‘drugs’ who are always craving and cannot be satiated and finally there are those in the hell realm where all manners of happiness are extinguished brutally and a sense of a never ending unhappiness pervades completely. I contend that schizophrenics are in the hell realm! How is this not the case?

174360693,I have been shaving off all of my body hair minus my beard and arm pits for months… I feel like I’m actually in hell especially with how dark the world is and has become with the political way of it all … even the atmosphere. Worst cases is when I get what feels like physically raped by demons over and over again. It feels like an unseen presence that can actually man handle me in a real sense. I moved to the west coast and all I had was my beautiful husky dog and then my lady also. Then right after the pandemic started he died in my arms from a tumor at the vet/. Crazy thing is a week before something happened in my brain and a voice told me there’s was sonethjng in his stomach a week before and I had to pull it out. Well I did and used energy or something and pulled out what looked like a glowing astral squid. All I know is that my lady is all I have and we both get confused by what each other are saying and days like this feels like specially dark and like the earth is cracking open to su
ck me up to the next layer of hell. It’s like I even hear my dog crying to me now while I also hear a Horrible mocking tone / frequency. There so much more but I’ve likely over shared and apologize if I’ve been to much or tried taking over the conversation. I’m sorry

176073399,LS! I dislike this website webmd.com. It is not run by researchers but by medics. Probably medical students who are drunk all the time and extremely biased against pills you decide yourself about. Every other website writes that creatine makes lab mice live longer. Creatine might make you live longer too.
176073400,"100%. The world is a very large place-- there is room for everyone. For people who have experienced psychosis, we have this forum, for example. Your family may have difficulties in accepting your mental illness, but you are NOT solely your illness. You are a human being worthy of love, and that love can be cultivated by being kinder to yourself, for starters. Depression is an insidious monster-- many of us here (including myself) have experienced the brutal lows that come with it. It’s an extremely tough thing to fight, but there are tools to cope with it, such as medication, therapy, and being gentle with yourself. Wishing you the best"

176073402,"It’s probably harder for you at your age. At age 60, I’ve never been (or rarely) the type to compare myself to other people or their lives. There’s a billion people doing better than me and another billion people doing worse. I’m just happy I can come to my job and I’ve usually lived comfortably in nice surroundings. My sisters both used to make over a hundred grand a year at their jobs. I make about $13,000 if I’m lucky. We still get along and they don’t lord it over me and treat me pretty good. They know my situation and they’re proud of me and that’s what counts. But yeah, it’s probably tough for you. I wouldn’t want to miss all that either. Schizophrenia makes you have to make special adjustments for sure. But you can help yourself by taking your medication and co operating with all the people trying to help you. Don’t even consider taking street drugs to cope. Drugs are a dead end and if you think life is hard now, well, doing drugs will make your life a hundred times w
orse. Just a word of warning. You still can get something out of life even with schizophrenia. Some people are still going to like you. You might make a friend and have someone to talk to. Your life may be different than most but it’s a big world and as you get older and can make your own decisions you can choose where to live and even choose where you want to work. And choose the people you want to be around. You may have obstacles that other people don’t have but you may meet people who really like you and you can have fun with."

If your bank offers such a service then consider you are blessed my friend. Because once you put in money in that account you cannot withdraw it instantaneously, thus impulses will pass and you can keep depositing money until you develop a inner calm and self control. Best of luck out there."

174360704,"Nice. Our findings revealed a remarkable association between adjunctive raloxifene treatment and the alleviation of verbal memory deficits. Isradipine treatment significantly improved the verbal memory and attention dysfunction in some variables of the Stroop test, compared with the placebo. However, no effect was observed in processing speed and executive function deficits. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that isradipine is a novel therapy option improving verbal memory and attention, both related to its activity in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of action for both drugs in schizophrenia."

176073448,"Harvard Health Blog – 6 May 16 More than sad: Depression affects your ability to think - Harvard Health Blog Depression can cause cognitive problems (for example, thinking through a solution to a problem). Antidepressants may not help much with these symptoms. To study the effect of three common antidepressant medications on depression-related cognitive impairment, the researchers asked over 1,000 people with depression who were taking either escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), or venlafaxine-XR (Effexor-XR) to go through extensive cognitive testing. In short, none of the medications helped. Of these patients, 95% showed no improvement on any of the cognitive impairments mentioned above, and none of the three drugs was better than the others at improving cognitive symptoms. This result is not completely surprising — antidepressant medications are mainly meant to help improve mood and increase the ability to participate in beneficial and enjoyable activities, two key aspects of depressi
on treatment. It’s also worth noting that different parts and processes of the brain are responsible for cognitive (versus emotional) functioning; this may explain why the three drugs tested didn’t seem to help improve cognitive symptoms. New drugs for depression may be able to address these symptoms as well. Beyond medications, problem-solving treatment can train people how to improve their problem-solving skills, and cognitive behavioral therapy can teach people to recognize and challenge distorted thinking patterns. Another approach, cognitive remediation therapy, uses practice drills to improve memory and executive functioning. Combining these behavioral interventions with antidepressants may yield better results for improving depression-related cognitive impairments."

Doesn’t even compare. The first two years I was pretty dependent on my parents and the nurses and doctors in the hospitals. Now I pretty much take care of myself and still manage to have fun sometimes and have my little adventures. I have people in my life who are causing me stress and distress. They are impossible to get along with. But hell, I’m feeling good right now and I ain’t going to let them rent space in my head. The weather is great, the trees are great, and I’m great.

I am kind of desperate to improve my working memory, that’s why I’m asking."

I’m very depressed and need to be on a antidepressant type med quickly because I’ve been having some dark thoughts that need to be addressed quickly. I’m waiting for my psychiatrist to contact me and I want to be prepared with a list of meds for depression. True antidepressants make me manic and psychotic and Lamictal made me super anxious and manic. Abilify made me super anxious and psychotic. Other than these failed drugs I am open to suggestions.

176073631,The first time I was sedated it was because the doctor had taken me off of the first drug that ever got rid of my voices due to the side effects so basically I was quite upset at the time. The second time I was simply acting really manic and stupid and got what I deserved.
174360757,"Anyone know why or how I’m in this time loop or causal loop? I think it’s a causal loop so basically I just pop into existence or some crazy ass ????. Haven’t figured it out. I keep coming back alive and reliving my life over and over again in the exact same fashion. Sometimes, things change and I think this is because the timelines are different or I’m in a different computer simulation. Doctors and you guys think this is a delusion. It probably is but it feels so ??????? real to me. Not sure what year I am from or how far into the future I made it. I died initially in my early twenties from unknown, paranoid reasons. I’m 30 years old now. Maybe I died in 2023 or some ???? but have no memory of the incident. Maybe my memories are from the future which is my past. I sometimes think about predestination paradox and ????. Or the bootstrap paradox, which I have experienced a few times. Not sure if this is ADHD or psychosis or both lol because I have too many thoughts from my past lives in al
ternative timelines. Sometimes, I think there are artifical timelines, divergent timelines, and timelines that have merged, but there is no proof of this. Maybe a timeline like this one was duplicated or copied similar to how a file on a computer was and is duplicated. If I’m the real _NAME_, why am I here and still around? I honestly think I’m being duplicated or cloned. Someone in a past life said so and that there were over 11 different versions of me. What does that mean? Was he lying? Does each clone have a different function and personality? Maybe I just pop into random existence and it’s ??????? hell living as a paranoid schizophrenic for what seems like an eternity. I was told there were two computer simulations left. One, where _PERSON_ wins in 2016, and the other where _NAME_ wins in 2016. I have experienced both. I am not sure if we are living in the Matrix because I have gone to different planets and ????. I am much happier with _PERSON_ because it turns out nothing has happened to me so far 
in this timeline. People have left me alone and in peace. I appreciate this and love God. I really do think I’m in hell sometimes. This is a recurring theme in my delusions: That I am or was a time traveler. I think I am not one anymore but I still have the psychosis from it. I’m basically stuck in a causal loop for eternity. I started waking up around 2011 at the earliest. Basically, it’s either I’m popping into physical existence and/or they are transferring my consciousness into a new body or over-writing it. I have had some very strange lives but I don’t feel like talking about it. Thank you for listening. That is all."

As a kid I would wish a ton that they would just get divorced and my mom could find someone who would treat her right and we could go live with them and ditch my dad forever. He used to be very horrible to her, emotionally and verbally abusive. My dad has grown up a lot as a person now and is pretty awesome most of the time. (He still has his moments) But their marriage still isn’t really any better. He loves her so much but sucks at communicating that to her a lot of the time. She is annoyed by every single thing he does, his EXISTENCE frustrates her. Every day she complains about him and talks about how she can’t stand him. He’ll literally just be helping do the dishes or cleaning and she’s like he drives me crazy!! Why is he doing that!! She says regularly that if he didn’t go to work during the day she would die. I’m pretty sure the only reason why she is still with him is because she is financially dependent o
n him and has no real desire to go back to school or work again. She has told me as well that she has no physical attraction to him anymore either and that his wanting to still do physical things stresses her out which I wish she had not told me because that is gross to know about your parents.

176073657,"All phenomena,processes,events,changes,disorders and symptoms that occur in the information of mental processes,emotions,chemical activities of the brain and the personal behavioral responses arise ontologically /functionally resulting from the activity of an adapted psychological parasite that you call it the hallucination ! Everything from a change,disorder or symptoms related the sz condition must occur after the issued of the vocal speaking of the hallucination entity to the host hearer Nothing of this happen according to an endogenous activity of the human genome or/ according to acquired psychological experiences or to abnormal environmental effects- that is true regardless of the theoretical assumptions The question; how do you understand what is happening in the level of the emotion /awareness of the person who listening to the vocal message that delivered by the hallucination entity (the speaker) ? 1- listening to the vocal message that emitted by the psychological parasite (hallucination 
entity) has the same effect When the gene RNA receiving the data message of the gene DNA !! What does this mean ? The gene RNA will produce (create) a specific protein after receiving the DNA message While after hearing the vocal message of the psychological parasite ,a mental concept (an idea /thought) is formed /printed in the conscious mind tissue of the host that corresponding to the text content of the received vocal message (the emission /emergence of a new mental concept in the conscious mind fabric of the hearer through a verbal mechanism /phonemic mechanism,which is a pure audible to the recipient than his personal thoughts ) In normal position,the ideas arise /emitted in the conscious mind in a non-sonic matter ( non- acoustic ),they are an implicit electrochemical Signals not a heard voices ,while the message of the psychic parasite that received in the conscious mind of the recipient is vocally / pronounced in nature ,so that it is more obvious to the recipient than his natural thoughts ! If the m
essage of DNA constitutes a specific protein ,while the message of the psychic parasite form/ synthesis a specific idea (in most of cases it is illusion ,false or mythological) If the data content of the DNA message cannot be modified by the RNA after it has been issued ,the message of the hallucination entity cannot modified by the mind of the hearer after it has been issued If the RNA embodies the data message of DNA into an organic material ,the data message of the psychic parasite embodies into mental concept ( a new inspired idea ) So that,the receiver must modify the perception of every vocal message after its occurs ,if he does not ,it will become a part of his personal beliefs,whereas he will think,say and behave behaviorally according to the directions of the inspired idea !!

176073670,"If it’s like pain tolerance, then it means a condition is for them unbearable. Tolerable is a synonym of bearable. The same condition for someone else being bearable does not make it any more bearable for the person under question. One could say that if a person can suffer unbearable torture for extended periods when they are forced to (such as being locked up somewhere), it’s true that there’s no such thing as unbearable - because they are bearing it! But that’s being true in a sick way. In my view if a person says they’re in an unbearable condition and they prefer not to exist, then that’s the truth. The problem is, that if there is a theoretical hope for the condition to become better, would it be humane to force them to suffer intolerable torture for indefinite time? I understand it could affect some people like close relatives emotionally quite badly, but to disallow it due to that would be selfish."

174360773,"My negative symptoms got slightly better after switching from 20 mg of olanzapine to 15 mg of aripiprazole. I took then memantine, which made my negative symptoms almost disappear. After decreasing aripiprazole to 5 mg ( which is a very cautious process that need to be done with a doctor ), my negative symptoms practically disappeared and, in addition, I got more creative and energetic. There is also a huge coincidence that my negative symptoms started right after taking the antipsychotics during hospitalization. I just found this article about Neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome (NIDS) and it seems that a person may be misdiagnosed with schizophrenia if the antipsychotics cause her negative symptoms. Follow the abstract: Abstract: Neuroleptics can induce not only physical adverse effects but also mental effects that produce deficit status in thought, affect, cognition, and behavior. This condition is known as neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome (NIDS), which includes apathy, lack of initiative, 
anhedonia, indifference, blunted affect, and reduced insight into disease. Although this old concept now appears almost forgotten, neuroleptics, whether typical or atypical, can make depression or bipolar disorder resemble other more refractory conditions, readily leading to mistaken diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The authors describe three cases of NIDS superimposed on depressive phase in bipolar disorder with psychosis, where the attending psychiatrist’s failure to recognize NIDS prevented patients from receiving effective treatment and achieving remission. All cases achieved remission after reduction of neuroleptics and intensive therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy, for bipolar depression. The concept of NIDS was originally introduced for schizophrenia, and it has rarely been highlighted in other diseases. In recent years, however, atypical antipsychotics are being more often administered to patients with bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists, therefore, should also remember and exercise cauti
on regarding NIDS in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder with and without psychosis. The authors believe that the concept of NIDS needs to be reappraised in current psychiatry. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/_PHONE_NO_ I’m thinking on sending the article to my first psychiatrist (who hospitalized me) in order to investigate my case better. My current psychiatrist doesn’t even think I have schizophrenia neither bipolar disorder and he mentioned that, yeah, antipsychotics may cause similar effects to negative symptoms. I think this article would be interesting for many people here because misdiagnosis sucks, but it happens."

176073731,It’s totally beautiful :)))
176073732,Here it is… night 4… 2 am… bars just closed around here and I can safely report I haven’t drank. It might be catching up with me… sort of emotional over things I’m usually not. Just watching a bunch of _NAME_ talks.

176073736,That means you have insight and probably getting better
176073737,I try to balance out my time with routine A walk every morning Some tv Listen to music I suffer anxiety so routine helps Sometimes I write down a plan of the structure of my day
176073738,I’ve been in that state of mind before however it has changed overtime and now I am happy to face the challenges that having SZ presents and try and make the most of the situation.
176073739,"Yeah, it pains me to say it but you’re right. I see that. I have to be more careful."

Dopamine Receptor Blockade: Antipsychotic Drugs)."
176073743,what stuff u after?
176073744,Wow! I love that you didn’t give up. Congrats; you deserve it!
176073745,We pay for our meds still. I get like a $6 payment for meds but they are subsidized because I’m on a disability pension. It’s way cheaper but faced without them I’d be in big trouble after a couple of weeks.
176073746,"Epigenetics is the interaction between genes and the environment. I don’t understand how methylation works or how it changes gene expression - that’s above my pay grade. I suppose you learn that in molecular biochemistry, and I never made it past HS algebra. But what I do understand is there are many drugs and supplements that act on gene expression and can up or downregulate genetic expression. So that’s a good thing, points to how they might be able to influence gene expression in a way that would be helpful."
176073747,"I am so exhausted all the time I don’t even really do anything because I cant leave my house or go to school anymore but no matter how much sleep I have I’m always tired, no one around me understands that amd all they say is "" you don’t do anything how can you be tired, I’m tired "" it’s even more exhausting having no one understand why you are so tired."

176073755,I don’t think so. I’m just not sure what would qualify as a delusion
176073756,You didn’t say top much. You need support. Tbh you need to teach your kids to call for help. You also need an anxiety med. No one deserves this much anxiety. Take the passcode off the phone or teach the kids the code and to call 911. You’ll feel better knowing they know how.
174360781,I like Aristada. It’s a tweaked version of Abilify. Especially for schizophrenia and schizoaffective. On it I have all my emotions back and can make myself do things. A lot better than Invega for me.
176073757,I can relate but without the voices.
176073758,I can feel that! My doctors keep saying that I should use logic to fight the delusions and at first it didn’t work at all but now I’m noticing that sometimes using logic can it least keep the paranoia at bay a little bit. I wouldn’t go so far as to say you can logic yourself out of a delusion but I will say that using logic is a good tool to help combat the delusions and stay sane. It is not easy but keep trying. Do you have a doctor and a therapist?

176073760,"I don’t want you to die. And your family loves you and doesn’t want you to either. You’re such a kind-hearted person. I do understand about weight. I put on 130 lbs. in the past year and a half, with 90 lbs. of it being since January. I look in the mirror, and I cringe. But I do my best to look my best if I’m going out. I may feel self-conscious and hate myself for the eating and hunger, but I can at least do the best I can with what I’ve got. Please don’t feel bad about yourself. You are loved, which is a wonderful thing, and this illness really can kick some butt. It doesn’t make you a lousy person- it just makes you human."
176073761,I used to could sing but I never could write a song to save my life. I tried though. Oh and I was a very good dancer
176073762,"I know that I tried Risperidone, at work I used to forget on what I was working on which was bad and was not able to match up with other employees, but liked Risperidone as it made me very social and too active(I was like “Yes Man” movie), pdoc put me back to aripiprazole with olanzapine after I lost the job, as immediate attention was too late to fix back things, as I was running around for a pdoc, as he was ill for few months."
176073763,"Mines non linear in time and far out there. Like I believe i was _NAME_ parsons in another life. I was _NAME_ v ( dont know last name), and _PERSON_ was my step father. Something sinister… I’m a good, Christian guy, but was insane in my other lives. I think Christianity protects me from aliens. I never figured out why or understood why I was targeted, except if I was a starseed or empath. Some kids like myself are screwed from birth. I was normal before 2011. Maybe im a doppelganger or from a parallel universe and not the same person I used to be. I think the world is sick."
176073764,"My mom,mybf, etc tell me they’re not out to kill me.quit worrying."

176073766,I lose. I lose. I lose.
176073767,It’s not. I’m very scared.
176073768,Let’s concede that I don’t have full insight. WHy should my “delusion” be a bad thing if it causes me no anxiety and no impairment in function?
176073769,"I’m bad for losing my money on slot machines aswell. I usually go with my mom to the casino pretty often because it’s our “thing”. The difference is that she has a job and i have none right now. So i’m essentially spending my savings, sometimes i feel bad that i lost some money from playing. I dont know though, it’s just something you have to choose to quit or not."

176073778,I kind of feel the same way. But I’m kind of losing interest in music now too. I enjoy listening to stand up comedy on spotify though even though I haven’t listened for a while. At one point I lost interest in everything and my psychiatrist said when that happens they encourage people “to find new interests”.
176073779,"I’m grateful for family, friends, and acquaintances. Also, I’m very blessed. It makes up for the trials."
176073780,Thankyou. I’ve been battling against this for the past couple of days. Today I heard something click in my ear. I’m trying to see did they stick it all the way down to my ear drum.
176073781,I’m sorry for you _AT_MENTION_. I hope your mood improves and your day gets better.
176073782,What do you mean?

176073783,"What then? There’s so many of us. What if some of us have people actually out to get us? Like in my situation, my ex boyfriend was interviewed by the House of Representatives involving the _NAME_ e-mail fiasco. He was told he could have a lawyer present. It was over 20 pages transcript. What if this connects to me somehow?"

174360791,One week of clozapine and it was making me sick.
176073788,"Yes, this is important. My vet recommended staying away from grain free foods (these are typically the limited ingredient diets)"
176073789,They’re good to get. I’ll get mine in about 2 weeks actually.
174360788,"When my negative symptoms were better, when on Abilify, I walked daily 20 000+ steps. I walked a lot and went to the gym 2h, elliptical + treadmill, almost daily. This week my average is 7000 steps. I am 30."
174360785,I have not found one yet.
176073790,I bottle my emotions a lot. I don’t talk about my problems unless I’m with my friends. I don’t even talk about it with my family unless asked.
176073791,"I’m sorry to say it, but I’m much older and reality no longer makes any sense to me."
176073792,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176073793,Which doesn’t really help knowing maybe. Because I don’t know how they pick who gets theirs first or in what order everybody gets theirs.
176073794,It’s about how I can stop ruminating over it. The pdoc has already diagnosed “mood disorder” but I keep obsessing it’s not and they’ve got it wrong. The treatment works I shouldn’t care.
176073795,"and thank YOU for the reminder, listening to _NAME_ right now. I love the sound of a crisp citar"
176073796,"Try _PERSON_ at least, that’s a good med. I can actually be perfectly fine mentally with minimal meds now on full strength _NAME_ water and a decent chelated multivitamin, my recovery is so pronounced. I’m just seeing if diluted _NAME_ water makes recovery possible. This is what I’m trying, that would make this regimen so cheap. I switched to dilute earlier today. The machine is expensive ($2600,) but I have one and can make the water. I’d sell it online for like $10 a gallon on top of shipping. Other people sell for $50 per gallon. One gallon makes 128 gallons dilute. I’d totally clone the machine and make it cheap, like $150-200. Just like a standard hydrogen water machine (this isn’t hydrogen water.) There’s also the PEMF machine avenue, but I won’t go there yet. Can’t legally do that, I’d have to talk to a lawyer at least."
176073797,it is all in the attitude. good for you _NAME_. glad for you too. _NAME_
176073798,"Why do you think they are after you, _AT_MENTION_? What happened? You must be very frightened if you are thinking about getting the police involved."

176073800,"Definitely, yes. I don’t know if it’s the psychosis. Maybe."
176073801,"You need to try to control your symptoms. If you manage to control your sypmtoms you will be free from the hospital. Also, the best outcome ( best for recovery) is to be medication-free and symptom-free."

176073816,That’s a beautiful wonder of the imagination in my eyes. As long as you don’t make it fearful. Sometimes when I meditate i imagine myself in a bubble floating in space.
176073817,Yea man I felt really dead during that time. Like near death experience.
176073818,Glad to hear it _AT_MENTION_!
176073819,"I have come across studies that suggest that even entrenched delusions vary in intensity over time, but I guess the challenge is to establish a workable threshold.

174360795,Yes this is why I too reluctant to try it. Also I think it will work only for those who have extreme catatonia and not useful for mild ones. I tried Valerian root which have effect similar to benzo and it did nothing and instead it gave dizzy feeling and walking got unsteady after taking it.

174360801,I traveled to other states before my physical problems made that a near impossibility. I’ve been on buses and planes. The best way to deal with paranoia is to keep up with the meds schedule (although if they put you to sleep you may need to delay taking them until you are able to afford to do so.) Carry your meds with you on your carry-on bag to make sure you have them at all times and keep controlled substances in their containers. I will have to say that if you are on a crowded vehicle it will be rough but keep in mind it won’t last forever. Have a watch on you to keep up with the time. Also keep conversation with others to a minimum (they probably do the same) and be careful who you confide in about your illness. Have a nice trip and welcome to our community.

174360806,Yes. I have mild symptoms. I didn’t have any positive symptoms when I was first diagnosed in my early 20’s. I began to remember a bunch of stuff like dissociative episodes from my teens in my mid 20’s and was a little crazy but people liked me. I lived on a therapeutic farm community then. No positive symptoms other than some parranoia at times and was treatment resistant when they tried to prescribe an anti-psychotic. In my late 20’s I accepted it. My 30’s I got involvd with clubhouse international so I was accepted of having a mental illness. After my last hospitalization along with the rest of my 30’s it’s become a focus of my life defining who I am to myself and I don’t like that. All my friends from my 20’s through my 30’s have had some kind of mental disorder or addiction. I don’t like that. In my teens I wasn’t diagnosed and had normal friends. But I accept it yes.

176073905,Exercising is good. Faint voices are nothing to worry about. I’ve been hearing them for years. I don’t worry about them. They are harmless. Especially if they are un intelligible. Exercise doesn’t increase voices or psychotic symptoms. If anything it lessens them.

I emailed the owner of the yoga studio I worked at for a year asking for a reference, and her response was “I would be happy to give you a reference, however I’m afraid that I really didn’t get the chance to know you very well.” Like, really though? I worked my ass off under her supervision for a year and she says that? So what should I do? Should I still list her as a reference?

I was not living well in Essex, but at no time did the thought I was self neglecting spring to mind. In hindsight I can see that I was. I think this is when family can be ever so important to notice if you are, and to advocate for help and support for you. I think I’d still be self neglecting, and not realising it, If I’d remained in Essex. Is self neglect just due to negative symptoms? I wonder how many others here have self neglected ."

But had to take AP’S again soon after when in hospital because my moods were all over the place and i was aggressive and heard voices occasionally. They put me on amisulpride. That was 2013. Amisulpride is expensive too but also worked well too so I stuck with it. Without AP’S my moods swing wildly and I hear voices more and Alien the evil spirit in my head tries to control me.

Not really a good nights rest. The meds make me tired and I can sleep pretty well regardless. I think the monsters are causing mental health issues and I might have a caffeine or ingredient interaction with the meds and the meds lessen the effects of the energy drinks where I barely feel them. It’s a strong, deep psychological addiction for me. My dad used to say if I quit the drinks, I would get better and may not have to take meds at all, which he has since realized is not true. I think I’m a special case and I would get better but take the meds because of self-diagnosed PTSD and stuff. I used to get depersonalization disorder and panic attacks in the stores and going out really bad. It has since gone away. It also plays into the whole super soldier thing that I can drink 10 monsters and survive. Been drinking them practically ev

176073933,For me In high school I always wanted to be a sports statistician. After my dreams of being in the mlb were ended freshman year of hs I wanted to work for espn and be a basketball statistician. I tried really hard in High school to get my gpa up. I got an A+ in statistics class for the year and was the statistician for the girls basketball team suggested by the teams coach also my guidance counselor. I wanted to go to university of Connecticut but I got deferred and that was kinda what lead me to trying pot. I’d try it eventually but I lost a lot of hope when I didn’t get in. I had a lot of heartbreak and that was the final straw I stopped caring after that for a while and lost my judgement. But now I’m thinking. I wonder if there’s anyway I can get back into math and statistics. Maybe I’ll take an online class on coursera and see what I think. I like the idea of statistics. I became too insecure at one point. Some girl in community service I had a crush on made fun of me for being good at 
math. And I became real insecure and pretended to be dumber than I really am after that. But now my brain is cognitively what it was in terms of my maths skills possibly albeit probably rusty but I think I wanna try to get back into it.

There are things that happened to me in my childhood (abuse, neglect) that I held against them. I unknowingly developed anger, longstanding anger. I was harsh and judgmental of others, but even more critical of myself. I was a ticking time-bomb, and my self-hatred was oozing out of my walking corpse. I eventually ended up in depression and later psychosis. In my last suicide attempt I lit myself on fire, and everything came to head. I had to dig deep and figure what was wrong with me. I still have shame and guilt over my drug use and whether or not that is to blame for all of this, but eventually I had to surrender my past. It is done. I am scarred for life.

176073994,"People generally think schizophrenics have multiple personalities…talk to themselves…and walk into movie theatres with AK-47s. That’s been my experience anyways. The hard truth is most of us will only harm ourselves, and basically we just want to hide behind the couch all day…when we’re in the throes of this affliction."
176073995,Kids are adorable except for me when I was a kid. You might get this one _AT_MENTION_ . I had a Samoan teacher when I was 10 at school. I cut out a picture from the National Geographic Magazine of _PERSON_. I added long black hair to it and coloured in the lips bright red. I then sent it to my Samoan teacher wishing her a merry Christmas. I had no real idea who _PERSON_ was and got into serious trouble for it.

176073996,I tried to be gentle as much as I can. But I honestly was so upset when I was reading this post of his.
176073997,I am not against legalizing it but against schizophrenics smoking it or ppl who abuse it. I mean it reduces illegal marijuana ??????????? which is good for all.

176074002,For me the switch from Zyprexa to Invega helped a lot.
176074003,Yes I’m okay. I don’t work. I have been getting worried with my spending habits. I’ve read on here that the supreme court does a every 7 year review about your mental illness. Does the supreme court checks your bank account? Do they check your credit?
176074004,You don’t know what you don’t know. Where is the teacher?
176074005,I went off the diet for 3 weeks and only gained a pound. Thats pretty good. Now I am working on loosing again as I saw some christmas photos from work and wasn’t so happy with how I looked lmao.

176074009,"Thanks for the answer I am a bit freaked out, cause lately my head hurts again so much even when I watch tv, even when I do some things… I don’t know if you see… My thoughts race even when I do some things and I get those terrible headaches. I cant stop thinking, but it looks like some sharp state sometimes… I will hope its temporary… Otherwise, who got better after years though and this, without a big help from the meds no matter that you were taking them? I know we need them. But when they help on 20 pourcents only for example, its tough…"
174360848,I remember some serious ocd behavior in first grade. I was in fear and had to go up and down on pieces of playground equipment a certain set way. I was a talkative child though and I think that helped me get through…and I had a great emotionally rich home life.

But maybe my progress is because of my efforts too… The patience is good, but it can make someone lazy… But its not my fault. I am passive because of the illness… I wish i can start to feel the progress faster and faster…"

176074017,"Yeah I quit smoking about two years ago. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. I lost a job over it. I still take antipsychotics. Hence, why I haven’t been on this forum for awhile. I suffered so much anxiety and depression from it. Minor symptoms of psychosis too. Tough call, I feel much healthier now. I hear you though, I used to want to quit the meds all the time. I have to take them though otherwise my life will simply fall apart."

The norovirus vaccine can only go so far. I have no proof or evidence right now but I’m pretty sure I’m right. When I’m proved correct, please send me money… I’ve already gone into detail and provided the company that will supply the pills as pill form is more effective. Out of a billion past lives, I’ve only been cured 2-3 times. I doubt I’ll live that long to experience the cure. Everyday is a constant fight and struggle. I just get so mad and furious when I hear about schizophrenia research because its just crap. No pun intended…"
176074025,Olanzapine is the best for me.
176074026,Thats a good idea. But sometimes i feel bored to listen to anything. Fact is that i miss lot of words and sentences while listening. Mind gets too stressed.
176074027,I spent my youth and young adulthood thinking. It wasn’t until I got into the working world that I stopped making more philosophical friends. Everyone got caught up in technology and I couldn’t keep up. There are no _USER_ID_ groups near me.

176074034,"I am hopeful about it and see it as good news as dealing with mental health workers has been challenging to say the least, so hopefully it will lead to better treatment. Apart from that doesn’t really make much difference I think unless you think I am wrong about that"

176074039,"I ignore mine completley - the more mental attention i give them - the more intrusive they get and louder - especially when in bed. This assumes i have the clarity to actually realise that they are not real, which thankfully 90% of the time i do now. I have a backup of 25mg Quietiapine now twice a day to take PRN, which has only been prescribed this week. And so far its been bloody marverlous - not a chirp outta “vicky” or her crap.

174360854,I am quite sure abilify is the medicine keeping you in check
174360855,It has some pretty funny side effects. Most of which I didn’t really put much stock into before I tried it. But I experienced more impulsive spending (buying random crap). And really high libido.
176074042,I dont know that those things are necessarily true

176074050,I have good days and bad days cognitive wise. But overall I’d say I’m getting worse. I think it’s a case of use it or lose it maybe.
176074051,"This is the main symptom I experiencing over the years. It started with a small issue and getting progressively worse. I first think it was anhedonia, depression etc but now realize its all due to this issue. At first I had issue with solving math problems I wondered why I can’t understand it even if tried many times. It appear that this issue make it hard to think in depth or complex which is required for maths and other subjects. Slowly it made doing everything as a complex task."
176074052,I’m sorry. Is there any coping mechanism you can utilize in this moment? I know _AT_MENTION_ can list some good ones.
174360853,"Abilify makes me a little skittish…have a hard time watching full TV episodes or reading long text. I think i always had a kind of short attention span, but I think Abilify kicked that into another gear."

174360852,"In my first group home when I was 19 and at the height of my psychosis, all they gave me to sleep on was a dirty mattress on the floor of a tiny room. There was also a 17 year old girl there who had cerebral palsy. She had problems but she was always friendly to me. There was also a little woman in her early thirties who I liked a little. She was OK to me and we were friendly but I actually wanted to sleep with her but she had no idea. So one day I was reading a book and the book was telling how _NAME_ used to improve myself by making a list of character traits he wanted to have and some character traits he wanted to get rid of and every day he picked one off each list and worked on it. I’ve always been big on self improvement even at age 19 and I thought _NAME_’s idea was great and this paranoid .schizophrenic who had nothing at the time (me) decided to do that. And coincidentally, one day the character trait I wanted to work on was not taking advantage of people. Well, so coincidentally that 
exact same day, I was laying on my mattress reading and the 17 year old walked in. She was being very friendly and smiling and sat right next to me, real close. I don’t remember how it started but she started coming on to me in a very direct, obvious way. She made it very obvious she wanted to have sex with me. At first I told her that I was dirty from sitting on the back lawn which was half dirt. She said she didn’t care. I was getting a little turned but then, in all my schizophrenic brilliance, I remembered my character trait for the day. And I thought she’s just a kid and doesn’t know what she’s doing and she has cerebral palsy. But in reality she was anything but innocent, and later proved it with another client. But I turned her down trying to be this noble guy. Stupid. She wanted it and I wanted it but because of that idiotic _NAME_ I missed out on some good sex. The funniest part was while we were in the middle of this the other woman walked by and saw us and said, ""Oh, you finally got him, 
you knew I wanted him. WTH! I had no idea. Two women arguing over me. I felt like such a player! Anyways, nothing ever happened with either of them and that was one of my big regrets"
176074056,"I can totally relate. My mind has been so quiet since I stopped hearing voices and having delusions. I’m having trouble reminding myself of how lucky I am not to be hearing voices, but I am so grateful"
176074057,"You have quality work. Start cataloguing your poems on twitter, or a blog. Seriously, I recommend it."

It has been a rolecoster ride, but the last few days have been an eyeopener!! I feel like I got a whole new chance. I have been given SO much more energy and a new will to keep on going.

176074074,"I did something rotten to one of the soldiers at work about a week ago. Don’t feel bad for him, they can take care of themselves. But I felt terrible for awhile. I rarely do rotten things; to me, doing something rotten is far worse than doing something mean and I didn’t like the feeling. But that glimpse of what rotten is made me think of how rotten my neighbors are. They’ve done rotten things in the past and continue to. I don’t see how they can live with themselves, they’re just bad people. And they think it’s funny."
176074075,_AT_MENTION_ - I went to the GI and he spoke to me for a minute and has scheduled a colonoscopy to see what’s going on. I hope it something that can be resolved because my constipation is really bad combined with hemorrhoids it makes things really bad. I just hope I can resolve this issue because I’ve been stable and on this medication for more than a year and hopefully I don’t have to change it. I try to stay active and try to stay busy but my mind keeps having all these thoughts about it.

176074092,Does anyone else have a “prescriber” instead of a psychiatrist? I hate how I’ll be doing good and she’s like “let’s not talk for another 3 months” Of course then things start going to crap and I need to talk to her… pretty sure I don’t have an appointment with her till March… great…

176074095,"I kind of do as well. I find myself quite anxious about it. It’s either the actual act of falling asleep or the act of waking up and not knowing how I’ll feel physically for the next wake period. I don’t remember how many hours it has been since I slept, it definitely wasn’t last night nor this morning."
176074096,We just recently stopped paliperidone cause of very high prolactin and allergic reaction. I was due my paliperidone jab on the 18th of December but I didn’t have it. Instead we switched to 10mg pill form of aripiprazole. Yesterday I got the aripiprazole injection 400mg. And for two weeks I’m to continue the 10mg pills. However I feel paranoid. I’m really scared my partner is going to kill me. I sent him to his parents house on New Year’s Day for the night It’s weekend now and my nurse is not in until Monday. I am feeling so paranoid. Do you think I will be murdered ?
174360874,"I believe that arranged marriages are potentially the best kind. I also believe in one partner for life. And without a dozen “trial relationships” before that. If not for schizophrenia, I would have been an example of that by now. At the same time, I admit to have overly high sexual drive, not sure how to best describe it. This can either be blamed on schizophrenia or be the cause of schizophrenia. I don’t care for feminism beyond equal pay and equal job opportunities. Does that make me an “incel”? Why is there a political thread in the first place?"

I’ll have the extra money for three months. But most of the time I’m below the poverty line even with SSDI and my jobs. I can still afford a few luxuries or maybe go out to eat occasionally."

176074134,If they checked my prolactin levels they never told me. When it came to that and weight the pdoc barely cared. When my man breasts grew I was told about a type of shirt to wear to hide them some. I never received a drug for my weight until I developed diabetes and that was from my GP. I know my prolactin levels have to be high but there’s little I can do about it. All my pdocs generally cared about were if I were stable. Latuda reversed it and I briefly became an actual man for a time but the drug ultimately failed so now I’m more or less a freak of nature again.

176074155,"I’m sorry. I don’t get too much into it here, but this is basically the reason I got kicked out of the Catholic Church. My priest told me I had to pray for forgiveness after I was raped, because I had sex outside of marriage. I thought that was wrong and said so, and then I was told I couldn’t receive communion again because I wasn’t in a “state of grace” until I asked forgiveness. It took a long time to deprogram myself from the instinctive guilt and shame I felt. It took a lot of time with a therapist trained in trauma recovery. It helped to talk to other survivors and hear other stories, and realize that if I don’t blame those girls, it isn’t fair to blame myself, either. I understand the idea behind that wwasp program you went through. Being raped robs us of bodily autonomy and free agency. Maybe they were trying to make you feel like you still have control over your life, or trying to help you feel like you can protect yourself by making different choices. But it’s not accura
te. Those boys were rapists, and they were going to rape you from the beginning. You had no control in that situation. But you have control now. You can control how you respond to the incident. You can choose to use it as a motivation for personal growth, or helping others, or even just choose to view it as an unfortunate thing that happened in your past. You’re helping others now, just by speaking up. Sexual assault depends on silence and secrecy, that’s why rapists try to shame you for their actions. The best weapon we have is telling our stories, and letting other vulnerable people know they aren’t at fault, they still have power, and they can learn to move forward again."

We identified two carriers (mother and son) of a triplication of the gene encoding glycine decarboxylase, GLDC, presumably resulting in reduced availability of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor coagonists glycine and D-serine and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction. Both carriers had a

I often think and wonder could it be possible the pineal cyst is a microchip? What about my frontal lobe? Could that be cancer or what about a parasite? Just thinking here. I’ve heard stories online. My vision was destroyed for 7+ years maybe 8 with DP/DR and a host of other crap like lack of depth perception and motion nearing 100%. It was so bad and my hearing was messed up and all my senses throughout my whole body. I suffered from extreme solipsism and maybe mild cotard’s syndrome where I thought I did not exist and was not real and even thought the outside world was a forgery and fake and not real and was a hallucination. I’ve been listening to _NAME_ online on YouTube and I hope I’m not a freaking clone. I think perhaps it all started in 2011-2013 and I woke up or started remembering life in 2013.

is I have a soulstone chip, I’m a clone, and I have a vrill lizard parasite. That would be my worst nightmare… It’s weird the whole soulstone chip would be near infinite quantum knowledge of most if not all of my past lives.

Even think about bloodletting maybe a cure"

176074249,"Damn, most of the day this was far from my mind. When night time came around it started messing with me again. I mean the thing about delusions is that they seem real. Truth is weather patterns cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy. For example, I’ve mentioned one person brings thing toward the Americas. While in my mind, my yell sends them overseas. For example rain and water (even in the form of hurricanes or a rise in tide i.e. floods). Now I haven’t spoken with that person in years. My delusional thinking led me to believe that they yelled a few times over the past five or so years just to prove the delusion wrong much like I did. In this complex delusion it feels like that was th reason for several hurricanes that have occurred even the Haiti disaster. Now _NAME_ is going back eastward, away from the states. In my delusion it had to do with bring rain water or renewing the earth in the Americas or in Africa, Europe and Asia. Of course the reasonable explanation would be climate change. An
d that is almost certainly what is really going on. Except that because of my illness, I believe we somehow influence these things. It isn’t like I read global seismic and weather reports everyday. Actually, checking immediately after yelling is a brand new thing to me. Now a few things I’ve used to rationalize in order to view them as delusions as opposed to convincing myself they are true are reading about earthquakes that occurred. Before the yell, leading me to realize it could all be aftershocks, afterall many of those places are known to have earthquakes around this time of year. The thing is last September I might’ve yelled once as well and Indonesia was recently affected by and earthquake. As for floods and all that I’m not sure. But the way my mind tries to convince itself is that it is somehow like sonar magnetic. For example that person attracts by some vacuum effect, while I repel by some sort of vacuum effect as well. Kinda heard to explain. I know it just isn’t possible. Besides that a 
yell from us can change things for years. But that cannot be true either as climate change is real and it is becoming more noticeable. Also in my mind, there are some celestial effects as well. Yelling a particular word during the day can cause a heatwave and things like that. It’s all a crock of ????. It’s just that it is a reoccurring delusion that had not really bothered me for a few years. Not to mention the seasons and all that. I wonder if we all yell “Quetzalcoatl”! During the day, would it really increase the temperature? I doubt it, but ???? like that sticks to me."
174360906,"This is so damn close to my issue. I also feel that the only way I can work is by self-employment. Unfortunately my spotty education suggest only mental work, programming. Due to schizophrenia I am incapable of concentrating. For five years, I read three paragraphs of a textbook a day, instead of half a book a day like I used to. I fail completely to analyse the market and come up with a product. Not even something seemingly forgiving in terms of quality as a mobile game app. I was writing and re-writing a game engine for four years now, it’s a complete depression. I really want some cursed pills that would recover my ability to at least read something that is not a stupid fantasy comic. _USER_ID_ get rid of monsters and delusions of grandure."

176074345,Hope you’re learning to put 2 and 2 together and see how the standard approach isn’t working. You need to rethink these things for yourself or you’re only going to feel trapped in this cycle. This is a cycle I’m also in. But the key to stopping it is self-inquiry. You have to realize most people in this current era are wounded themselves and aren’t capable of care taking our deepest feelings tenderly. I think it’s important to ask yourself what does your ideal life look like and what would be the steps you have to take to get it? You don’t feel this way for no reason; there’s something causing you to feel this way and getting what we want is key to getting relief. “Coping” is certainly not a good strategy long-term. Coping implies we have no desire to change anything or that we don’t feel that we can. Can you see how that is?

176074365,I currently take 5mg of Risperidone and weigh 280lbs (127kg). I came down with diabetes in 2011 and was taking Zyprexa at the time. I switched to Risperidone. The Risperidone is now causing dry eyes and nasal congestion which were really bad last winter. I’m thinking of switching back to Olanzapine because of the dry eyes and congestion because I can afford Olanzapine. It’s cheap like Risperidone is. What do you think I should do?
176074366,Luckily it passed for now

Only thing is it’s estrogenic so I got scared and stopped, thinking plant estrogenic were bad, but I’ve learned their ok now. So I try and take it daily even though the effects aren’t as strong when on antipsychotics because they block a lot of the effects, in my case anyway."

176074396,You can try amisulpride first it’s about as effective as clozapine on average
176074397,I chose the one I’m on now. Invega. I rarely have hallucinations anymore and I’m not gaining a ton of weight.
176074398,"I am still unsure how to interpret external audio hallucinations. The fact that I actually experienced one and believed it to be while it happened is siginificant for me though. It opens up questions of “Can I always trust my physical senses?”, “Is it only audio that may fail or can other senses also?” , “How can I know the truth of a suspicious physical experience?”. These 3 main uncertainties are always about the future though and, as an imagination, the future is ALWAYS uncertain. I may have expectations about the future but have the option of choosing my responses when that expectation is actually realized or unrealized when we believed it would be. It’s sort of a Zen of Now point of view versus relying solely or prior plans and has helped me critically in dealing with my psychosis. Hope is something we can hold onto when the Now is not what we want it to be. As long as there is a future, hope can ALWAYS exist for the self. We choose when to stop hoping. In my psychosis, I have fo
und that holding on to my sense of self during that time and believing that my experience will get better has helped me persevere until that belief is realized. Doing so has always led to extreme joy at the end of extreme negative psychosis. And there are relative changes in mental state during the psychosis that I can use to support my current hope despite the negative reality. I am also of the (belief of) belief that belief strongly determines our reality. Essentially, what we choose to accept as true or ‘real’ from our plethora of our life experiences. I will outline my ‘thinking’ during my psychosis and changes in thinking also. The references to the power of my negative self is based on how much control it has over my ability to control mental thoughts. Another key aspect is believing that change is always possible. Current state: Negative self is becoming more mentally powerful. Think: I dont like this. Response: It was less powerful before so I was able to experience more likeable reality. Hope 
that I can experience this again. The above state can loop if the current state becomes even more negative. Current state: Negative state is staying the same. Think Okay. Response: At least it didnt get worse. I can maintain hope for better reality. Current state: Negative state improves. Think: Awesome! Response: My hope was realized! My ability to trust that this hope can be realized again is stronger. Note that 2 of the above 3 states are ones I can readily accept. Those are pretty decent odds. Holding onto the hope of a better future can be grueling but in each case of extreme psychosis the rewards of the heaven at the end were worth the hell I had to go through to hold on to hope during the conscious experience. This approach is much less feasible in the physical reality. When I believe I can answer an unknown in the physical reality, I am required to rely on my body and outer reality to change matching expectations of my belief. I have much less control of changes in my physical reality vs my mental rea
lity. But even scientific discoveries started by exploring a mental theory. And my experience of discovery is based completely on my hope that a new physical path will open up as a change to explore what a prior exploration of a prior theory failed to achieve. The joy at the end of psychosis could JUST be a flood of Oxycontin at the end of a flood of cortisol. But I choose not to believe that because my ability to hope was the reality I had control over that helped me to get to the end of the negative state."
176074399,"yeah my brother is really busy, he works hard for his money, putting in 60 hours a week. he has 2 daughters in college, who i see more than him, because they come and visit us. he will have grandchildren soon probably. i just need to get over it i guess. but don’t think i’ll see much of him anymore once mom and dad pass. he lives 1400 miles away, he does stay in contact with mom and dad over the phone though, so that is the only way i know what is kinda going on in his life, when i get updates from mom and dad. mom tells me to call him instead of sending a yearly email, but i dont have a cell phone. he always tells mom to tell me he loves me. which honestly just drives me crazy and annoys me for some reason."

174360954,"brief psychotic episodes are where you get psychotic for a short time and never again. and there’s other diseases that last less than the six or so months required for a schizophrenia diagnosis. the thing is, it seems like doctors want to put you on medication and never take you off. maybe i’m just not aware of what they do when you dont have symptoms much any more given i always have some sort of symptom. but even based on what i read, it seems like doctors want to put you on and never take you off. i did read of one doctor who puts you on and then tapers you off if you dont have symptoms again. but i dont know much about this and this sounded like it wasn’t common."

174360953,"Mine was severe. My first year I was in a group home but I was unmedicated. Next was 8 month’s in the hospital at age 21. People often say do not compare suffering. I’ll just say that my case was bad and I paid my dues. In a way, I didn’t lose much when I got sick. The few years before I got really sick I was working a string of unskilled, entry level jobs and partying. I had a car and had a lot of fun but I was on the outskirts of society anyways, riding around in my friends '66 low rider Impala, stealing and drinking. I don’t forget where I came from though, I remember my years of psychosis, I remember that first group home and sleeping in a tiny room on an old mattress thrown on the floor for a year. I remember having nothing and doing nothing. I remember being really sick. It just makes my life now seem sweeter compared to when I was 19 and 20. My life now compared to the eighties is like night and day. Back in the beginning my whole focus was on my disease; now I not only focus on bad 
things, but good things as well. All my suffering in my twenties just makes me appreciate what I have now and how far I’ve come. Both my parents died years ago but I still have my life though I took my mom’s death particularly hard. IDK. Life ain’t easy and downright sucks much of the time—but that’s life. My disease doesn’t run my life like it used to. Or at least not as much. Now I just have people problems and getting along with people who seem focused on making me unhappy. But I get out most days, I have my clean little room, I have wheels and a little money. I’m not doing bad for myself."

I don’t have to work as much (my current schedule is 10-15 hrs a week) and there’s no expectation for me to do more than I currently am. For me, dreaming big is saving enough to buy a small apartment or condo. I used to think I would want a kid and if I find a partner equal to the challenge then that might happen. But for now, living a low-stress lifestyle, albeit somewhat isolated and sedentary, is fine with me. Lucky or not?"
176074433,Yes but men a lot of times date younger. I wouldn’t date a 30 something. If I was in my late thirties or early 40s I would. Also since I don’t have a solid career I wouldn’t date a girl who did. It’s pretty common. I’m not naive I carry myself well and thirty somethings flirt with me to I mean I’m 33 why shouldn’t they.

176074436,"Im excited guys. I decided to write a book (or if I cant swing it, a short story lol) about a guy who kills himself and is born again as a child and slowly gets back memories of his past life. Here’s the first bit of what I wrote so far: Pain is a strange concept. It’s one of those things you forget about when it sticks around too long, but you also forget about it when it’s gone. There’s nothing else like it. I know that all too well. I find comfort in pain. It is familiar, like an old friend. And just like an old friend, I’m afraid of losing it. But today that ends. Looking down, I take a deep breath. The city looks beautiful tonight, streams of light illuminate the cloudy sky, millions of souls whisk through the busy streets below. Sitting on the cusp of a ledge, I know there will be no way I can do this on my own. I yearn for someone to push me. I am too comfortable in this misery; it is too cozy—too inviting. I can’t do this on my own, but I must. Another deep breath. I close my 
eyes and start counting, like children do to fall asleep at night. This sleep will last forever, though. I can’t help thinking about what she said, about how this is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. “Of course it’s ??????? temporary.” I say aloud, jolting my eyes open. “Life is temporary.” My mind races with thoughts: memories, snippets of conversation, times I laughed with my friends. It was all a façade. I can’t keep pretending, I just can’t. Nothing about my life has been real, from the beginning. Another deep breath. This one will be my last, I tell myself. I close my eyes again, and, without thinking, let go of the ledge. Let me know what you think! Good or nah? I know the idea is cool but the execution is what Im worried about lol"

One of my x was a best friend too but he hasn’t replied to my email. I had a online friend I cheated with daily but he dumped me and ignores me and seems to want nothing to do with me. Some friends I had over sixteen years ago dumped me because I didn’t and don’t work and they do. I have no friends as such. Not any I can chat to with online and not any I can meet in person and hang out either. Thankfully I believe I have friends in spirit and two people said through my body that they are my best friends. They said I am their best friend. I don’t think it’s a delusion. I think two people exist who see me as their best friend but we only have contact in spirit.(why not in person n body though?) I have my sacred neigh and family and am thankful fo
r that. I miss having friends and I miss some friends I had. I would love to have friends in person but making friends is difficult for me and keeping friends too (I seem to have lost all the ones I had) I have not felt my best friends much lately but I missed feeling them around you know what I mean.

176074448,"We don’t allow religious discussions on this site. This for a couple of reasons. First, it tends to cause arguments, because for some reason people can’t seem to just respect each other’s different religious beliefs. Second, many folks suffer from religious delusions. It is one of the top three topics of delusion, alongside aliens and government conspiracies. We don’t allow discussions on those topics, either. Third, there are many members here who were subjected to exorcisms by family members who, sadly, did not understand their illness. Those memories can be very traumatic for those individuals, and they don’t need to be reminded of them. I hope you can understand, and help keep this a safe place for everyone.

176074464,"I took my box of 20 diazepam tablets out the office and threatened to take them all and the on-call manager )I live in a group home) threatened to ring the police so I took off so they did ring the police as reported me missing so I had the police looking for me all morning. They found me in town and took me back to group home wanting to know how many tablets I took, I refused to say so they rang ambulance. I then gave police the box of tablets I hide in house and didn’t take any. I did it because nobody listens to me. I have no control over my life. No control where I live. No control who I live with. No control over my money as court ordered person looks after it No control have medication I have (I’m court ordered injection) Have to live in group home. So I kicked off. The police was nice to me though."

176074465,"Well, my pdoc thinks, that i dont have energy because of my paranoia… But i have anxiety as well and till now, i wait still that my ap works on my paranoia … Its possible, that i have a bpd as well, so thats why i am not very relieved by the meds… But maybe this will come, no? Does your ap gives you an energy though? I have a depressed friend, who found the zyprexa even lifting lol… I find this strange.

176074481,"Nice I love ot on a time card, it makes you feel rich"
176074482,I guess cuz they’re sedatives. Most sedative drugs are dangerous when mixed with anti psychotics. I mainly stick to stimulants but have a sedative occasional when my symptoms ‘flare’ up.
174360951,"Hi, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago. recently my doctor released me from all medication and said to me that I no more need medications. the issue is that since 4 years ago I have lost all of my libido. I can no more feel love, emotional interaction or any sexual desire at all. I consulted a sexual therapist for this, and he told me that I should be married to start the treatment while I am not married yet. I am not sure, if the treatment gonna help with my situation. did any one faced a similar problem ?"
176074483,"I was just kidding. I’ve never paid the IRS anything since I started working in 1978. (there are a few gaps in my employment). I’ve always got something back. My taxes are pretty simple except when I cashed in my 401K one year. Yeah, yours is sure more complicated than mine."
176074484,I absolutely love that x
176074485,Prodromal I think. Close enough. I was always a bit different. I thought way too much about everything and I just really slid into psychosis. I was smoking way less weed because it was weirding me out. So yes. I always had things like ocd and depression. I had a depressive break 5 years earlier with a lot of subtle paranoia. I think there was a time when I was going into psychosis but that was over a week or so for me.
176074486,Don’t forget social needs. There’s a lot of self threatening social neediness to my father and of course children are in that category too. As adults we’re supposed to outgrow the neediness. Doesn’t always happen.
176074487,I got lucky with my current doc. I told her the problems I was having with the haldol. She talked to me about it for 45 minutes. Then left the room to get a second opinion from another doctor. Point is some docs care others just see dollar signs
176074488,"As someone who gets bad headaches from the scent of perfume, I would recommend just getting a nice scented shampoo or body wash and skipping the fragrance. Probably not a popular opinion though. Back when I worked the line at Wal-_NAME_ unloading trucks, they had this woman from up front help us and her perfume gave me the worst migraines. Not sure why I get headaches from it when others don’t."
176074489,my mom comes home. She’s been gone a week. it’s very hard on me while she’s gone. It makes me more determined to widen my social circle so i don’t feel so lonely and isolated without her here.
176074490,Yep For awhile I was writing them down And turning them into poems When I’m having a nightmare I ask _NAME_ to come hold me Til I fall back asleep But he never will This is likely due to PTSD

176074493,Don’t apologize I appreciate the gut reaction even if it was not what I wanted to hear. There still seems to be some debate out there over whether or not this disorder gets worse as you get older…

174360977,"Thankyou, That’s exactly what I think might be the reason for the lower dose. Because the psychosis was caught early. But idk. Are you on abilify? And I didn’t even seek help, fortunately my dad noticed me off, and he called my cpn straight away… Lucky for my dad"

I always say it but try building up some motivation to exercise. It’s good for heart health and I think it can have a big impact on your mental health! Walking 30 minutes three times a week is a good start. Start slow but build up pace so your raising that heart rate.

176074507,"That’s very nice of you _AT_MENTION_ I think I will be ok, a bit annoyed as I was free of psychosis for 10 years and a dr decided I had a personality disorder so giving me sertraline (an antidepressant)without a mood stabaliser was ok to him. He saw me a few weeks after being on sertraline and after that day I was in hospital with psychosis… damn the man didn’t bother to read my notes it seems."

176074513,When the voices and delusions are too strong you do act. I acted by attacking my brothers with knives when unmedicated. It never happened while medicated. Meds increase my anger and aggression threshold.

176074519,Your answer is frankly bizarre. Why would I pay for advertising to get a shout out on the radio? That doesn’t make sense. My friend has got me on TV before and can easily put me in touch with a presenter. The presenter can do what he wants on public TV. It’s totally legal for my friend to work in the media. Where we differ is that you think that people acting in their millions together in a chatroom is a bad thing because freedom is bad. I think freedom is good. There is absolutely no harm that can come from this idea.
176074520,Those are so cool. Makes me wanna go get some paper make stuff.

176074527,I have a hard time keeping jobs. I always end up quitting when I either get harassed or when I think everyone is against me. I also sometimes get in my own world and that affects my performance sometimes. I get excellent reviews but I just can’t hack it. People just don’t understand why it’s so hard for me. I wish I could find a job “home” and stay there.
176074528,Yeah I guess so but I just feel like I cant do what everyone else can do. I miss doing art and crochet and now I’m too tired.but I hope that one day I’ll be okay

176074541,"I knew no other way until I experienced psychotherapy. It was the most attention I had ever gotten from anyone. So, I am obsessed with it. Even years later.

176074542,How Did you get the camera?
176074543,"Hey guys how are you? Just thought of an observation of different diagnoses over the years. I think it took a long time to get right one and I hope it doesn’t get changed again. My illness course is clearer now since I’ve had it for over 20 years 2002 - bipolar 2003 - bipolar then sza then sz 2004 - 2007 - sz 2007 - 2012 - recovered 2012 - bipolar 2013 - sz 2014 - sz and borderline 2018 - sza and anxiety 2020 (presently) - sza, borderline and anxiety What about you guys?"
176074544,"_AT_MENTION_ It’s a toss-up, I think. I can usually hide the positives, but eventually, they get me (which is why I restarted my meds). I shouldn’t have gotten off the meds in the first place, though, because I didn’t have my doctor’s approval. It was wrong, and I know better than that. _AT_MENTION_ Sorry for the confusion- I meant that my TD was fine, not my positives. _AT_MENTION_ You make a good point."

176074547,I’d like to not be alone and to live for as long as I can stay lucid and in relative good physical shape.
176074548,It’s fine to make that decision for yourself. I am just pointing out that it’s not the same for everyone. Marriage doesn’t make sex magical or “making love”. It just adds legitimacy for some people. My problem was the post above mine that makes it sound as if sex outside of marriages is somehow wrong. It’s not.

174360989,I went through a phase early 2019 where I thought the same thing. It was when my schizophrenia first set in and I had a couple of break downs. I went to the mental hospital a couple of times and at first I was coming up with every they in the book and then some. I thought the music on the radio was about me I thought movies were connected to everything I was going through and it wasn’t easy but after about 6 months after being diagnosed I started to slowly find myself back in reality but everyday from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed and even sometimes in my sleep my voices tell me that “everyone is laughing at you” “go home” “leave already” “nobody cares about you” I recently started writing down all the things my voices say to me on a daily and it helped me realize that there’s no actual people or persons in my head. Its repetitive and annoying but it helped me realize that a lot of the things I went through had the same repetitive phrases and dialogue. It’s you
r own brain that connects your thoughts and emotions to what you are hearing. If I have a thought and suddenly hear something I simply remind myself that I’ve heard it before and it’s not true. For me my voices tell me I have to “run home” by running a marathon. At first I was training and trying to “just leave” (whatever that means) all the while trying to figure out what was happening to me and theorizing everything. I thought people knew things or were doing things based on my mental thinking. Now I honestly have quit my marathon training because it became exhausting. Even on good days the voices would taunt and mock me or keep telling me to run. I will slowly try and go back to normality and basic excercises but I’m not interested in running a marathon and I know it won’t change anything. Nobody is watching you or listening to you. My biggest advice is to try and recognize your mental patterns and those of your voices. Its helping me allot even on bad days and believe me I still have hella 
bad days.
176074556,This isn’t true… I’ll tell ya originally there wasn’t a hell… that ???? was just made to stir the unabiding innocents into feeling like wrong do-ers… it is somewhere on the same side of the scale as genital mutilation. Nature is not evil… it might be terrifying and challenging… but it’s not evil… humans on the other hand… hah yeah they ??????? suck… even on a good day.
176074557,And are emotions really just chemicals in the brain? Will there be a med that will give me back my emotions? Is it possible or not?
176074558,Sometimes I’m too afraid to make eye contact with people because they could read my mind. Other times its because it’s distracting to me and I lose focus on what I want to say. Other times its shyness But mostly it’s distracting
174360985,What do you do if the voice(s) talks to you when you’re trying to talk to a customer or a client?
176074559,Congratulations on the 6 months sober. Can you download and read some CA materials? I’m an alcoholic and reading the AA material from time to time helps me. Also just take things 24 hours at a time. The desire to smoke will eventually go away but you’ll always be an addict (like me).

176074561,"Your kids don’t care about the cognitive issues or physical ones. (I’m not meaning it the way it sounds). They just want to spend time with their mom. Life goes by so fast. I really wish you would push yourself for you and your kids sake. Make memories as the day will come that they aren’t little anymore and will have their own lives. Google list of things to do with your loved ones. I found some awesome ideas and there are several lists that pop up! You could even pull them up on Pinterest with more details and pictures. If money is an issue you can search things to do with your loved ones on a budget. Don’t let your fears and paranoia keep you from experiencing the joys of motherhood and creating lasting bonds and memories. Remember your delusions aren’t real, but your children are!"
176074562,Well done _AT_MENTION_ . If you can do it say yes. My last really good job I was just Xmas help but I’d always show if someone dropped a shift. Got me a great full time job eventually and excelled even with the meds and all. Keep on keeping on and it sounds something your good at and doing easy. Keep the stress low and more power to you. I can’t think of anymore of my cliches at this time but …Well Done to you
176074563,"The top of my head has always been tighter than a drum, so to speak. The source of pain and difficulty in eating and talking. I think this is why I like to write.

176074565,"Same here. I went voluntarily to the hospital most of the time; but I ended up at the urgent psychiatric numerous times, via my mental health team and the police. I was very confused myself; during both the voluntary hospitalization and involuntary. I also think there is a computer or other chip in my head that allows people to see my memories, talk to me (like telepathy), move me (like in a video game). I just have to live with it."

I want to try and build some space away from it in my life. my cpn told me about how he has patients who are in really difficult situations and it doesnt necessarily change. for me that is emotionally overwhelming and exhausting. especially cos i can kinda empathise. on the other hand, you can say that it must feel great to just be there for them as a non jugemental person just a friendly presence, regardless of what mental state they are in and do or dont remain in"

176074571,Yes I’m an artist too. Before I was medicated for sza I used to paint prolifically (in my late teens) After that it went down. Nowadays I only paint once every few months. I wish I could paint more but my avolition is so bad. I have to wait for the rare good day. Nowadays I try to keep my paintings as simple as possible so I can finish them in one day. Because if I don’t then they go unfinished for several months and I’ve abandoned two paintings because of that.

176074573,"Usually I’m the same way, nothing in my head but today my head was filled with rapid thoughts and images. Some of my thoughts were weird. Like I was seeing images in my head of a couple of horses painting the walls of a church! … strange! Maybe that’s because I didn’t sleep well last night. Having blank thoughts could be the result of being on Antipsychotics."

176074586,"My first episode lasted about seven months, spanning the entire final semester of my undergraduate studies, in which I took courses and wrote an extracurricular thesis. I finished it in nominal time and with distinction. My roommate, classmates, family and friends noticed nothing. After finishing my thesis I went to the GP to tell I had been psychotic for over half a year. Then I told my loved ones, who were quite shocked. In subsequent episodes I had been more open about things from the start, telling people I was hallucinating again and so on such that they knew."

174360997,"Well in my experience being Bipolar is a hundred times easier than having schizoaffective disorder. I never was told to kill myself, I was never called names, stalked by someone in my head who threatens me, and I never lost my grip on reality and thought I was in an alternate dimension. Schizophrenia is like an atom bomb and Bipolar is like a freaking firecracker by comparison. We don’t just have MI here, we have possibly the worst form of MI that exists. A lot of these celebrities are complaining about things like bipolar and even classic depression… those I believe, and it’s an issue. But if they were hit with the sledgehammer that is schizophrenia, they’d be in psychosis in public, possibly on camera. We’d all know it. Sometimes I wish it would happen to someone famous, to raise awareness, but then I realize that wishing a disease on anyone is evil and I scold myself for it."

He said my bad visual thoughts are down to anxiety so I dont know what is going on with me. If its anxiety causing all these unwanted thoughts then the lyrica should help? I’m sick of the thoughts, and feel as though I am imagining it all myself. I told him I speak here, didn’t give him the name of the website and that many here have said I may have schizophrenia. He didn’t say anything to that. I am definitely not sure at all what’s going on with me. I’m confused and hopefully when I see my regular psychiatrist I might get to know more. I do think as well my symptoms are neurological. Told doc that today. He is very nice and maybe I don’t have schizophrenia but I think I may have a form of it. Delusional disorder and somataform disorder, anxiety and depression are what I’m being treated for. Does anyone here take the c

What other meds have you tried? My pdoc says that clozapine is dangerous and is much harder on the body than any other antipsychotic in existence, and as such, it should only be used as a last resort, once it is apparent that at least 5 atypical, typical, and pairs of AP’s aren’t keeping you from being too psychotic to function. Is there a certain reason that your pdoc is willing to put you on such a strong drug after only 5 months of proper treatment?"

Hope you are able to switch soon and that those side effects go away! _AT_MENTION_ I was planning on posting an update on the 29th of this month but I will post it now :::::::::UPDATE (1month after last injection):::::::::: So to recap, I took a 50 mg injection on July 29th. I thought I was going to take the 25 mg injection this month, but my pdoc told me to not take anymore injections after the 50 mg one. Basically, the half life of invega sustenna is 25-50 days, so my thinking is that is took about 30 days for the concentration in my body to reach 50 mg, which is around this date. I didn’t have any major changes, because I’m still on 2/3rds of the dose I was on, but some things happened which I think are mention worthy. I was listening to music one day (can’t remember exactly when, but probably two weeks after my last i
njection), after I woke up from an afternoon nap, and in during one particular song, I felt the same kind of motivation that I used to feel when I used to go the gym. But it only lasted for the duration of that song. Also, this other time I was listening to music as well, I actually felt like I enjoyed listening to a new song I had discovered. But I only noticed it for that song. And I didnt listen to it for much time. So yeah, not much to report, and maybe these things were kinda placebo, but I’ll keep looking for things like these."

I am going to talk to them about Abilify as it seems like a treatment option that may have less impact on motivation so that I may have some semblance of a normal life.

176074825,"I think I have read somewhere and my cpn has said this that if you stop cold turkey, yes a relapse is more likely than if you stop slowly by reducing the med gradually in dosage over time. Giving the brain time to adjust and perhaps somewhat decreasing chance of relapse at least so quickly. I also wondered if antipsychotics is something that once we are on it our dopamine receptors in brain may increase in response to the medicine stopping dopamine receptors from working. So therefore If we come off the medication abruptly, there’s maybe an even larger number of dopamine receptors than before. So you are more sensitive to effects of dopamine… And cos dopamine overactivation is thought to cause psychosis, it leaves you more susceptible to psychosis. I will try and find the journal on this. Whereas if you gradually reduce the dose, the chances of psychosis whilst coming off or shortly after are reduced, because the brain is given time to readjust to normal dopamine receptor levels… Maybe this i

Spare yourself from strife.” For I wanted to swim under the waters; I am swimming there now, I am breathing joy.

176074865,"This is related to C-PTSD, not psychosis. I have had a period of harmful exposures from my mom. She had an unstable relationship with my father because my father was always at work. She put her frustration on me and trained me to become a perfectionist. One day, I was asked to recite a poem for a competition before I went to sleep. I recited my poem, but my mom laughed. I told her, “Mom, please don’t laugh. I am trying my best.” Then, she said in an angry voice, “LAUGH? Did you just say that? Don’t laugh at me?” … and threw a fork on my feet. Thankfully I was not hurt. However, that is one of my vivid memories with my mom. She sometimes threatened to send me to an orphanage when I didn’t do something right. I hated that place- an orphanage. I thought she was really going to send me there. Forks…if someone drops them, I will be immediately triggered and I just realized that. How scary my childhood was."

I have it since 2014, plus unbalance and I am clumsy and awkward as well. I tested negative on spinal tap and my scans were showing white matter lesions in the juxtacortical area of my brain. All neurologists I saw said I didn’t have MS thankfully but I still believe I do, because all my symptoms point to MS as one neurologist said, but that doesn’t mean I have it. Due to my constantly saying to the neurologists I think I have MS, one of the neurologists sent me to a psychiatrist who prescribed quietapine and abilify. The psychiatrist told me I had somataform disorder. So that’s where I’m at right now. Somataform disorder and depression and anxiety. The fatigue is so bad that I just fall into bed unable to do anything or keep my eyes open! Hopefully your tests will be clear and you dont have MS."

176074906,How long have you been sick? When I first got sick in 2008 I didn’t think I was sick and I kept on working. Applying for disability was the furthest thing from my mind. I burned through 7 jobs in a couple of years. I think about 9 months was my record. My shortest stint was about 6 weeks. After losing my 7th job I finally applied for SSDI in 2014 and got it right away. But then I got stable and found the right meds. I went back to school in 2015. I graduated in 2017. I started working a little again in 2017 and went off SSDI this year and have been at my current job since April. So about 8 months now or so. But this is ten to eleven years after diagnosis with insight into my illness and stable on meds. It took me a long time to get here. Give yourself some time.

But the during those phases I question myself about everything and start worrying about everything then reality hits and I realize I am. It’s an endless cycle. I’m to afraid to go off my meds your a brave soul if you do. Sometimes I fantasize about going back to work having friends living a productive life then reality hits me again and I’m humbled and I just count my blessings. But I really do feel like sometimes I’m not schizophrenic I think this disease plays tricks on you you have to be careful with it. I worry about everything so I obsess over if i am or if I’m not.

SZ is a tough disease but if you get healthy in general… I mean psychically and spiritually as well as emotionally… you can improve your happiness. Why do you sleep so much? Is that from the meds. Maybe you can try a lower dose if your doctor OK’s it. Also can you find a way to go for walks in nature. I think doing some activity will make your brain produce good chemicals that will make you feel more happy. Do you have any intellectual hobbies. Reading stories about other people who have had difficult lives can make you feel better about your life. Do you have any spiritual interests. Like meditation, yoga, or some belief that can help you make sense of this difficult situation. I’m not promoting any religion but I know my spiritual beliefs give me the strength to live on. If you want to make more money, are you a native English speaker? I can tell you how to teach English online and you ca
n make some money. Please contact me if anything I said is of interest… Best wishes. _NAME_"
176074933,"I know- mental health can be ruined for those who are physically ill. My point is, mental health is not just a problem for the mentally ill.

176074934,"I guess nicotine patches and gum don’t cause psychosis. But definitely don’t smoke while on them, you can trigger an episode. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A case of nicotine psychosis? _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Addiction (Abingdon, England), Mar 1995 A woman attempting to stop smoking using transdermal nicotine patches experienced a variety of transient delusions and hallucinations after smoking a cigarette.

176074936,I think they were joking around and didn’t mean to hurt you. I was called ugly and bullied and that hurt because they said it with hate and disrespect and malicious. Then another group of people called me ugly but they were my friends and said it with love so it was ok. I didn’t care if they called me ugly because I knew that they loved me. The other ones that bullied me hated me and put me down and treated me badly. Difference how it’s said. My boyfriend has man boobs. I have x boyfriends that have had man boobs too. My boyfriend might have bigger tits than me but I think he is sexy just as he is.

176074943,"still dealing with this stupid episode, its just keeps coming back, at least the risperidone tamps things down. I think I have narrowed down what may have triggered it. When I wrecked my ribs snowboarding , the first night I had no tylenol 3s and so I had a few puffs of weed that night and morning. Then I took tylenol 3s for 2 and a half weeks, up to 12 of them a day. So that was quite a bit of codeine I guess. Pretty sure that upset the balance. Atleast thats all I can think of."

176074947,_AT_MENTION_ How are you today?
176074948,"It depends on planning, working memory and executive function. If have planning issues then not do what to do first then what next, how it affect future actions etc. Working memory, if have issues in this then when do some thing forget about what to do next even though you have planned it before. Due to this chances there you get side tracked by other distractions etc. Thus can get late, fail to do daily activities on time, skip, procrastination etc. Executive function, the ability to discard irrelevant things and focus on achieving immediate and long term goals. Focus on future benefits rather than immediate benefits. Then comes problem solving skills which come under IQ. This is useful if faced with challenges in life. Apart from these require good short term and long term memory for smooth functioning. This kind of short and long term memories help to form and follow habits easily thus things which we do daily like bathing, eating, walking and other things become automatic which do not require m

174361090,For me it’s the what ifs that psychosis may be able to lead up to they are so bad from my experience that I don’t even want to say them out loud
174361085,"There are a whole lot of different symptoms for mental illnesses. Some has it worse than others. I think what you should try to keep track of is if you feel like you are in control of your brain, meaning if thoughts start to pop up consistently that disadvantages you like for example delusions, hearing voices, the world stops on you because you are unable to think or you are otherwise not able to function. Those are some of the warning signs. When you are on meds you will usually feel in control, but when you go off things can happen. But ofcourse you should try to go off at some point if you feel good. A family doctor told me that you can try to quit once a year if you have had no symptoms of mental illness for the previous year. I think that is a good guideline if you do want to try to go off. Just be careful whatever you decide."

176075011,So I got sick a month ago and decided to take a week off to recover and eventually just stopped going to the gym and since I’ve noticed that my mind is a lot more still and I’m sleeping better as well. My mind isn’t constantly racing as it was before and I’m not constantly waking up in the middle of the night. I didn’t realize that me exercising was triggering all my symptoms. I always thought exercising would help me manage the illness and even though I was feeling better my mind wasn’t stable. Has anyone experienced something like this??

174361099,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A _NAME_-analysis of the associations between theory of mind and neurocognition in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, AM _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Parent, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Dec 30 2019 Theory of mind (_NAME_) refers to the ability to infer the mental states of others. _NAME_ is impaired in schizophrenia and these deficits seem to hinder functional recovery. _NAME_ is thus an important, but complex treatment target, supported by several processes. A large number of studies report significant associations between _NAME_ and neurocognition (e.g. memory, attention), but the neurocognitive domains that are most closely linked to _NAME_ remain to be identified. A _NAME_-analysis was conducted to estimate the magnitude of the associations between _NAME_ and neurocognition in people with schizophrenia. Correlations were extracted from the relevant literature, transformed into effect sizes Zr and pooled as weighted means. Focused-tests were employed to test for differences betw
een neurocognitive domains and for differences linked to the characteristics of _NAME_ tasks. Ninety-one studies (N = 5462) were included. Moderate associations emerged between _NAME_ and each neurocognitive domain (Zrs 0.27-0.43), with no significant difference between domains (?2(8) = 11.89, p = 0.156). Within the domain of executive functions, abstraction showed a stronger association with _NAME_ (?2(4) = 18.93, p = 0.001). Several _NAME_ tasks characteristics (e.g. modality of stimuli, type of mental state), were significantly related to the magnitude of the associations between _NAME_ and executive functions, visuospatial/problem solving, attention and episodic memory. These results suggest that _NAME_ is linked to a wide range of neurocognitive abilities in schizophrenia, and that _NAME_ tasks are a significant moderator of these associations. The assessment and treatment of _NAME_ should consider the neurocognitive profile of each patient to understand his difficulties and to tailor interventions."

176075045,True. We’re all different. I’m a vegan but I wouldn’t recommend it for everyone because it would be too difficult for most and some people need more meat or fish.

176075050,"Hello again and thanks for coming back to me so quickly. Ok so are there alternatives… like, other things that could explain what I’m experiencing? I remember this happening once before when I was maybe 14. Just happened once though as far as I can remember. It started again a couple of weeks ago and is now kinda consistent. It only happens at night and when I’m feeling anxious. Mental illness might run in my family but as far as I know it’s mostly depression and addiction. Theoretically the could be cases of schizophrenia that simply no one has talked about. As I mentioned before, my knowledge regarding schizophrenia is rather limited but I always sort of put it into a different category than for example depression. I assume that depression, anxiety and personality disorders are mostly caused by trauma (with a potential additional genetic variable), whereas schizophrenia is directly caused by a malfunction in the brain and not really related to the before mentioned mental illnesses. Is tha
t at least partly correct or am I completely misinformed here? Why I’m bringing this up… I do have experience with anxiety and depression but these things are not actually related to schizophrenia or are they? Would the fact that I have experienced this once before when I was younger be a sign for it to be something else? Like is this possible in schizophrenia or would it have gotten worse and not just happen once and then stop and only start again years later… I understand that only a psychiatrist can confirm if it is schizophrenia but is there a way for me to find out how likely it is… like “if you had schizophrenia you would almost definitely experience these other things” and if I don’t experience any of them I could be quite sure that it’s not that?"

When I was initially psychotic during onset, it was like I was under truth serum, I’d tell everybody everything. I’m back to the point where I can keep secrets with no problem again. To be honest I’m the type of guy who researches a drug, wants to try it, then says whatever I have to in order to get that drug prescribed so I can try it… as opposed to just opening up and letting the pdoc make an independent decision about my meds, unless things have been going well and nothing seems to need changing. Honestly my meds had been working fine and I didn’t want them changed so I opened up at my most recent appointment and put the ball in her court… and the pdoc brought up adding Strattera. That one was her idea, not mine. I would prefer to just cut out the middleman and have all the psychiatric drugs available over the counter to try, but hey, that’s not the world we live 
in. Probably a good thing I guess."

Eventually it reached critical mass and i started going to places of worship telling the priests about the end of times. One of them threatened to call the cops on me because i was scaring the people praying lol. I thought animals were sending messages too. Then i started taking meds and it all slowly vanished. No more thinking that pop stars were sending me secret messages, no more thinking people were talking about me. Everything went back to boring reality, but im kinda thankful it stopped.

176075163,I hope you’re feeling better. You did the right thing to go in.
176075164,I guess it’s just the part of me that wants to overcome _USER_ID_ and be treated as someone who can look after themselves and isn’t a mental cripple. My peers in support group are understanding towards me not working and in fact my parents probably just want me to be more responsible. I think I’ll end up being satisfied with whatever work I can accomplish. In fact only one friend wants me to work (really badly) and acts like nothing else is important. I need to hang around this friend less because she’s driving me crazy!!!

174361149,"So I’ve been holding on to this secret for quite some time now. At first I didn’t know how to react to it, but I guess I just took it as it was. So along with being schizophrenic my psychologist has diagnosed me with antisocial personality disorder. Basically I lack empathy. I have assessed my life quite a bit trying to understand why I have so much self control over the urges to hurt others. I even surprise myself when I bring up my animals because I use to torcher them as a child. I guess what I’m trying to say in my quest to be “normal” I have adapted to having feelings. My psychologist asked me if I really cared or if it was a learned behavior that I picked up as I observed people. I told her not all antisocial people go around killing.

176075245,"I’m 31. At first I had no memory of things. I started getting ‘suspicious’ of getting schizophrenia in 1 day from pot. It just didn’t make sense to me at all. (I got schizophrenia at age 23). Then I went on Topamax and got some brain scans (MRIs) and started getting un-dissociated and started getting extremely paranoid. This was in 2015. Ever since 2015, I have changed. Then in 2016 I saw some UFOs over my house and they were communicating with me. Not sure if I got abducted then, but they said I helped ‘design’ those crafts. I started getting past life memories of being an engineer. Felt like a parallel universe. I don’t know. Seems to happen in every life like a time loop/causal loop. It points to a causal loop because of lack of memories. I have ‘extreme and crazy’ theories about myself and my other lives. I seem trapped in the year 2011 but it feels like it’s 2013 like my life was ‘adjusted’ by MiB/aliens. Like I know I grew up as a kid, tried boy scouts, and stuff, but 
it wasn’t really me. Like it’s just another person or the past didn’t exist – or I had no consciousness like a philosophical zombie. I started smoking pot again in 2012-2014 since they didn’t diagnose me with schizophrenia, but just asperger’s syndrome. (I had a card). Sort of felt like Illuminati or just mk-ultra and definitely aliens. I think it could be mainly aliens, but I’ve read a lot of people get abducted (re-abducted) by the military after they get abducted by aliens. Not sure what happened to me or if I was in monarch (possibly montauk too). I have memories of going to mars and being told I’m a super soldier and SSP experiencer. I have memories I was a time traveler (unwillingly of course) (I Hate it) (I have no control over it). I have other memories of past lives too of being other people and creating things. Mainly, I think I live in a computer simulation and been to other simulations and was trapped there and even escaped before and worked with aliens and the aliens gave me gifts 
before. Some aliens are good and helped me before and others have really ?????? with me and hurt me bad. I think some aliens are protecting me. So yes, the past 9-10 years the schizophrenia just turned on like a switch instantly after a NDE and God told me I am trapped in the Matrix and I was basically a sinner. Stuff like being a computer simulator and creating false realities or something like that in a past life and then posting it on the internet that ‘we live in the matrix’ and ‘I was a computer simualtor: the guy running the matrix’. I guess it isn’t true anymore. (I thought I was being judged and going to hell/dying). I then woke up and became super-self aware of my reality like hyper awareness and altered consciousness. I’ve lived countless lives like the waves of the sea or particles of sand on a random beach. I’ve been told a lot of things in my past lives that weren’t true and false. Sort of like a TI (felt this) and stuff. I got really scared in 2015 at the psychiatric hospital. No
t sure why the patients (mainly) targeted me. Not sure if I’m (_NAME_) (_USER_ID_ (etc). All this stuff was a different reality. I don’t think I’m _USER_ID_ but it’s just a feeling or hunch I have. I have no money and just want to be left alone. Even though I had delusions I created Bitcoin, I regret it if I did. I built a time machine; I designed UFOs; and I ran the simulation. Now I’ve been trapped for eternity/infinity looping through time and realities since 2011 – since I got my schizophrenia. Worst places I’ve been to are _NAME_, Mars, Moon, Montauk, and other DUMBs/places that I rather not mention. So basically, I got triggered and the memories just came flooding in since 2015 and continued into 2016 with the ufo(s) visiting me. I tried being a Christian but then how do I explain the reptilians and greys and insectoids and fish people etc. and my experiences of immortality? Demons? Simulation theory? I remember everything people tell me especially from past lives in dreams and stuff. West
world? There’s a lot of mind ??????? going on in my life. I do really worry about my own safety but I also worry about my family’s safety. They don’t believe me and the therapists and doctors are just cruel to me – wasting my time and denying and invalidating my experiences. They say: “it’s very real to you. We believe that. But it’s not real to us.” My life sucked so bad and that some aliens felt bad for me and helped me and took me out of the matrix and healed me. I am greatful for that and still cheerish those memories. I feel like I am the “world’s most tortured person and perhaps the world’s first immortal being.” My dissociation was so bad nothing felt or looked real and I went insane (most insane person in history I felt) because I couldn’t tell or know or think anything outside of my brain was real. It was worse than blindness. I even tried getting help and was curious about getting money, but I rather just accept my fate and try to move on and heal. My life was destroyed man
y times. I think you can give schizophrenia to people especially psychosis. I often wondered if this happened to me in every life – on purpose of course. I just know it. I feel and sense it all the time. Basically, I’m afraid I’ll never get a job or live a short life or experience tragedy again."

176075258,Yeah you might be too sensitive to the nature of those people’s experience to be fit for the environment. Doesn’t mean you can’t do good for them. With the education you were pursuing and your own experience you will likely find that “keyhole thing to do” to improve the perception and care of mentally ill individuals. I mean… progressivism is complicated because it’s so multifaceted… support gets spread thin and it’s all highly centered around specific issues and specific demographics… and a whole lot of folk are still relatively well to do in the face of what a mentally ill individual experiences. It’s likely mentally ill individual’s are last on the list. Aside from the backbone of research professionals who have devoted their lives to progressing the understanding of mental illness. I know that there are political movements vying to get more support for the mentally ill… but I’ve also seen how easy it is to overlook them. Most other peer groups get pretty aggressive wh
en it comes to making their claims. Like these anti-abortion/pro-abortion rallies…

176075290,"Yeah…I’m coming around on that point. Years ago there was a bi polar sister site. I presume _AT_MENTION_ probably knows the story more than me. It failed and I’m not surprised by that. STill. The modern interpretation of things is bi polar at one end and sz at the other and a lot of crossover. We draw the line with psychosis here apparently but that can be problematic. Drugs, different symptoms…it’s a murky world. I do hear your opinion though but as a very old consumer of this site I’m moving to more acceptance. Some people still piss me off and float my understanding but with the levels of moderation and decisions made we aren’t doing too bad… It’s still a valid point though."

176075331,"Any advice from personal experience here? I’m coming down from a “grandiose delusion” where everything I did was either for the best interest of humanity/the universe or to the detriment of it. (You can probably see how easily one could feel defeated and suicidal here.) But, it feels like my world is sort of…colorless. The things I do don’t actually matter. I feel directionless and like an infinitesimally small speck of nothing important in an overwhelming, uncaring, and brutal universe. Anyone else ever feel this way? My Haldol has been increased enough for me to see from this new vantage point and I don’t love it. I wasn’t walking around telling people I was important before, I just made subtle changes I hoped when ripple into large and important ones. (The downside and impetus for going higher on the Haldol was my increasingly frequent suicidal behavior from feeling like I’m single-handedly failing humanity.)"
176075332,I can drink alcohol but it doesn’t make sense for me. Sure I rarely drink enough to get drunk but it’s just wasted calories and regularly I could be doing other things more positive. It’s hard. Like I can drink everyday and did for a long time but it just held me back. I can still be well without it and it does get easier when you let it go and give it some time… I’ve found replacing negative behavior like drinking is best replaced by positive like exercise and that has been working well for me. IT’s hard to get there but so worthwhile.

But I’m glad he did it. I’m now blacklisted from all heavy painkillers, even after I had my wisdom teeth out I only got ibuprofen. But I’m so thankful. Over time, the painkillers make the pain even worse. Once you’re off them for a while, you might be surprised to find the pain dulls down to background levels. You’ll get used to it eventually, and learn to keep living your life with the pain. Humans are adaptable, and you will adapt. But you need to get rid of the easier option, first. If you know there’s an escape from the pain, you’ll keep taking it."

176075350,I am trying to get a web chatroom mentioned on TV or radio in order to let the audience escape and work in their millions. There’s a good chance I will succeed. My friend from school has worked in the media for over 20 years and is at the top of the TV industry. On Facebook he has about 300 media friends including presenters and executives. He can easily get the words “you need a darkweb chatroom” mentioned on air. If he logs into Facebook for me then wars and politics are over. At work I have now known my colleagues for 18 months and they will be happy to record a video with me on my phone asking my media friend to tell extremists and revolutionaries amongst his many media friends. I will ask them when we next go for drinks within the next few weeks then send the video to my media school friend on WhatsApp. If my colleagues agree to record the video it’s over. If someone wants to help me stop wars and save lives before then – let me know. It’s fairly easy for the idea to take off. The j
ealousy on this forum is literally through the roof but stonewalling on here won’t stop this idea now. My colleagues will record the video asking my friend then that’s it.

176075407,I mean it might be good for PTSD and other psychological problems but I don’t have any of these.
176075408,"Yes I unfortunately get delusions of the devil and demons being after me as well i remember when I was more unwell and off meds having this ominous feeling that something huge and terrible was going to happen like the apocalypse. I think what helped me with the fear was applying some things I learned from cognitive behavioral therapy. I worked to change my thought process from “I feel scared”—>“there must be demons around”—>“I am in danger” to “I feel scared”—>“My disorder is causing these feelings”—>“I am safe”. It kept me from spiraling and going full-blown paranoid. I also learned to recognize triggers for my paranoia such as darkness, cold, open doors, mirrors, large spaces, etc and did my best to create an environment for myself in my room that did not have these things so I had a “safe place”. I’m glad benzos help you too at least. I used to have to take a benzo every night to get to sleep to help deal with the fear and anxiety of having to face the demon
s, until my meds kicked in and shut them up."
176075409,The days are long and lonely
176075410,I’m so sorry you have that feeling. Sounds like you are really going through some hard times. Some hospitals can be really heartless for sure. Stay strong.

176075415,"1.3 Thought Pressure (C.1.3) A sense of many thoughts (or images) with different, unrelated or remotely related meaning/content that pop up and disappear in quick sequences without the patient being able to suppress or guide this appearance/disap-pearance of (ever new) contents of consciousness. Alter-natively, all these thoughts seem to the patient to occur at the same time (simultaneously). This symptom in-volvesa lack of control, many changing thoughts, but also a lack of a common theme and hence a loss of coher-ence or meaning for the patient. The semantic content of the thoughts may be distressing but also neutral or even trivial, without any special personal signifi cance. Often, this phenomenon is associated with spatializa-tion of experience (1.8) where thoughts are experienced in a spatialized way, and sometimes even with a subtle acoustic quality (1.7) https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1159/_PHONE_NO_ Very Like my bedtime experience before getting on regular meds via depot."

I was first diagnosed with bipolar when they thought I was having a mixed episode and the pdoc put me on lamotrigine/lactimal and my diagnosis didn’t change for 8 years and I was on lamotrigine all that time. Anyway, now I’m diagnosed with sz I technically don’t need a mood stabiliser.I keep trying to come off it, but every time my mood crashes and I get really depressed and get what can only be described as awful withdrawals. It’s so bad that my pdoc said to just stay on it. It seems bad to me as it’s another med on top of the sertraline and abilify. Has anyone else become addicted or dependent on a med and then found they can’t come off it?"

176075455,It might interact with your meds? Basic research says it interacts with the Cytochrome P-450 detox in the liver. I think a lot of psych meds are metabolized by the CP450 system. Your blood levels of antipsychotics will most probably increase.

Since I was last here I was hospitalized again (bummer) and I’ve finally come to terms with my illness and what it means to me. I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and bi-polar disorder. This year I tried doing what I said I would do years ago and I signed up for University. I’m studying Art History and Archeology. And to sum it up in one word it’s been difficult. I would love to hear from any of you about experiences of going to school after the illness. I find it especially difficult to read, and also I am very scared about social interactions. There is a program in my country for tutoring of people with mental illness but even though I signed up I for it I am hesitant to really go through with it. Btw, all my classes are Zoom classes so far. So what’s your advice, how can I make it through the school year?"

If my partner and I went for a holiday in America, we would be temporary vegetarians. Now I’m not saying that Australia is free from some questionable practices, but it is fairly easy to identify free range, stall free animal products. My overall plan though, is when the make lab grown meat products, I would switch to that immediately."

This is generally a really good thing to aspire tk want to do because it’s going to benefit you if done correctly. I read somewhere that our “relationship” with a higher power is all about how we “see/perceive” the higher power. If you feel helpless an dependent then you will experience things like guilt.

The mental decline being above that that would normally be expected for a person your age . The average person of 30 should do better than the average person of 70 on an IQ test.

176075576,"Please feel free to critique or offer constructive feedback Untitled, chapter 1, first draft It was a peaceful midday, and a little family of deer were grazing quietly, as rabbits ran by and birds were singing. The doe led her little family further into the woods, and ducked her head down to get a particularly savoury-looking mouthful of grass. Suddenly, she noticed the birds were fleeing the trees, and she lifted her head, adjusting her ears in the direction of an approaching sound. Branches were breaking and a thudding noise got nearer fast. The doe and her kids quickly gallopped into the woods, far away from the emerging noise. Just as they had ducked out of sight, a young woman emerged from the bushes. She had not noticed the deer, in fact, she barely noticed where she was. All she knew was she had to keep on running. And boy, did she run. Branches were grazing her face and arms, leaving tares in the process, but she did not notice. She stumbled over a root, but quickly regained her running sta
nce, her white dress now stained with both blood and mud, and her knees badly scraped. She ran through the forest as fast as she could, constantly listening for the swirring sound of surveillance drones. She had spotted one earlier, but managed to duck under a particularly leafy tree before the drone passed over her head. She knew if she was spotted now, there was no escaping. Her escape itself had been a mere fluke; had she not used her sleepwalking mother’s handprint to unlock the main door, she never would have made it out. She could almost picture her father’s face when he came to wake her and realised she was gone. She did not, however, want to imagine his rage, and the tremendous amount of effort he undoubtedly put into finding her again, nor did she want to imagine what her punishment would be if they got their hands on her. More intense ”treatments”? No school? Would they completely abandon her after she was married to the wealthy, nasty businessman they had promised her to? She stopped for a 
moment to catch her breath and shuddered at the thoughts she was having. As she put her hands on her knees to breathe better, the full realisation of what she had just done hit her, and she could not hold back the flow of her midnight snack coming back up. She wiped her face with her sleeve, and had some water from a nearby pond before she turned her head quickly to look around, and continued her run. She ran until it got dark, and she thanked the Gods that she had run track all those years in school. She only stopped because an overwhelming sense of fatigue and hunger took over. The sun was still setting, and she could see the immediate area around her. She had run to a larger pond, surrounded by fruit trees. The fruits were large and orange, and resembled mangoes. Too tempted to think about it, she picked one off the nearby tree and wolfed it down, quickly followed by another. The fruits were juicy and sweet-tasting, with a slight bitterness to them, and she ate them with great joy This, however, turned out 
to be a big mistake. Minutes after eating the fruits, she felt a prickling sensation in her mouth and throat. She ran to the pond and tried to rinse it out, drinking huge gulps of water in the process, but to no avail. Her head felt lighter, and she could have sworn she saw the shadows move. Suddenly, the pond started sparkling and the trees were whispering to her to return to her home, and she made the grim realisation that these were no ordinary fruits. The feeling in her head, no, her entire body, reminded her too much of the ”treatments” her parents and the doctor had given her, and she stuck her fingers in her throat to try and throw up the fruit before more damage could be done. But it was to no avail. She got an urge to run again, and tried, but her legs would not cooperate and she fell face first into the ground. She smelled the ground, and thought it smelled wonderful. She tried to get up, but the dirt was just so soft, and the trees were singing her what resembled _PERSON_s lullabies. She slowly 
drifted off while having a conversation with a friendly-looking nearby branch, and had no idea of the imminent danger she was facing."

174361217,Tulsi tea helps to reduce impulsive behaviour. A popular health supplement also helps in reducing impulsivity. I think you need to investigate why you getting impulsive behaviours. Many medications can bring these and also many other substances. If any medication is causing it then you need to replace it with alternative ones which do not bring impulsive issues.

I don’t know. But you aren’t the only one who thinks this way. You aren’t alone.

176075610,"_AT_MENTION_. I’m sorry that you’re feeling so down. Can you reach out to your mental health team if you need help managing? I’m sorry you’re feeling victimized and bullied. I guess that all I can recommend is that you try to separate out those people who are genuinely trying to offer constructive advice versus those people who are just being mean and not being constructive. And ignore the latter. I have been on the receiving end of bullying myself and I agree that it does not feel good. However, it’s worth remembering that bullying behavior reflects poorly on the bully not the victim. It’s also worth remembering that one has no control over how another person acts but one does have control over how oneself responds. I hope you start feeling better soon. Take care."

Break a law that does not harm anyone but in doing so gives you pleasure. What are they going to do? Arrest you? Do something really stupid that does not harm anyone or go against your religious beliefs. Tell your voices that you enjoyed their company. I don’t mean to depress you but they may be the last friends you have. If you still have bothersome schizophrenia symptoms tell as many people involved in your care “Thanks for nothing.”, or better yet “Thanks for trying.” Tell that stupid joke that was going to make you famous. If you are expected to die today ask for the weather tomorrow."

I cried about how alone I am, how much pain I am in, and how there is no one. I was going to self-harm but my mom stopped me. My mom took me outside and talked to me for a while.

174361216,"I have been following the symptom that I’ve named “carbonation grimace”. It’s an aversion to carbonated drinks that is popularly known to be a side effect of migraine medicine Topiramate. But some people, like me, are just born with it: we can’t drink soda. I’m increasingly finding evidence that this is more than a “tidbit of the tongue” and rather a real indicator for our brains. Now, in relation to schizophrenia, I’d like to propose a test. I can’t drink soda, but my test for you isn’t so simple as asking that. Here are the steps. Touch the tops of your cheekbones and find the “zygotmaticus minor” muscle there. Flex that muscle, and everything above it in the face. Hold that position, and loosen everything in the lower half of your face. You can loosen the zygomaticus minor muscle now. Sip a soda, or have soda dropped into your mouth with a straw. I am interested to hear if schizophrenics experience a grimacing aversion to the soda that is “invoked” by this simple fa

What is pathetic to me is the misogyny that I see from y’all. I don’t see as much of it as I used to, but maybe that’s because I don’t read as many threads as I used to, though I suppose it could also be the mods doing a better job of shutting that crap down. Women do not owe you sex; they do not owe you a damn thing. I’ve actually seen incels on here blame all women for rejecting them, as if it had nothing to do with their shitty personality. The particular incel I have in mind for that is no longer active on the forum, but he was one of those who thought if he built up his muscles it would help him find a gf. Guys, women are not normally that shallow; they’re turned off by your shitty personality, not your physique. Okay, I’ve said what I needed to say, feel a bit better now. I have been celibate by choice since May 2016, when I decid

176075657,This morning I weighed 56.8 kg. Unfortunately I’ve been binge eating today but I’m happy with my weight. Thought it was worse. I’m comfortable between 50-55 kg . 55 kg felt good cause I can still eat ice cream etc but in moderation. Would like to lose another couple kg but am still happy with my current weight.
176075658,Just remember nothing the neightbours can do to you.
176075659,i used to take 200mg but i quit cold Turkey … completly psychotic…again appointment _PERSON_ …
174361225,For me it is too much sedation… death in life. I have dystonia and dyskinesia with all AP but it’s not severe. I take very low doses but i have sensivity because i had traumatic brain injury. It’s 4 a.m. in my country…i was sleeping but I’m awake now because of dyskinesia in my tongue.
174361229,Sarcosine helped with more cognitive issues not other negative symptoms. Long term use of a high dose of fish oil has helped with motivation somewhat. I believe that fish oil has helped me to stop sleeping ridiculous amount of hours. It has also helped with libido. I just switched to latuda from invega sustenna which I think is helping me to fell a little bit better. I am still not where I need to be to start working full time. But I have noticed some improvements.
176075660,"sometimes i worry that i am becoming psychotic because i think crazy stuff and am just kinda weird and do stuff you wouldnt consider normal, but as i have observed normal people they do much more crazier things than i do, i probably appear more normal and boring than 90% of mentally healthy people, i think i am too self conscious to the point where i think every odd thing i do is because im going crazy somehow but really i am very sane on meds rn i have my moments but im starting to think maybe there is no such thing as normal and even mentally healthy people are kinda weird and have crazy moments and i just need to not overthink everything. im not saying im not mentally ill because i still have psychosis and other things but right now on these meds i am probably as close to feeling like a regular healthy person as i can get"
176075661,"_AT_MENTION_ has some interesting information about niacin. I can’t quote it from memory, so I’m summoning him."

176075664,I also tithed to a church because I thought God would kill me and damn me to hell if I didn’t.
176075665,"Hi, The last time I went looking for a therapist I think I pissed them off because I told them that I was trying to decide who to choose. What do you look for in a therapist? How do you go about looking? What do you tell them? I don’t think I am going to get any referrals from people I know because I don’t know anyone."
176075666,Nice now draw a zerg
176075667,i love that song.
174361220,I have been on both Abilify and Latuda (I was also on Clozaril 400mg at the same time for both of them). Abilify didn’t do anything for me at all at 30mg but I also don’t remember having any side effects from it. Latuda helped me with my negative symptoms a little bit but i stopped it because it was putting me into a catatonic state when the dose was raised to 120mg. After stopping Clozaril I tried Latuda again by itself but when it got to 60mg it made me throw up every time I took it so I came off of it.
174361238,I think the situation is somewhat better than when I 1st got a sz diagnosis in 1975. Back then expectations of what you were capable of achieving nose dived with the dx. There is a greater acceptance nowadays that with the right factors it’s possible to achieve despite the diagnosis.
176075668,"It’s Wednesday and that means music therapy today! I’m going to make it a U2 day, at least that’s what I’m planning on. For starters, I’m going to be wearing my The _NAME_ Tree t-shirt, and I’m going to choose “Window In the Skies” at song sharing. But, I’m kind of split between what song to end our jamming session with. It’s a toss up between “Bad” and “Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses”. The former would get me to stretch my vocal chords, but the lyrics of the latter are really great and hard hitting. Any U2 fans out there? Which do you prefer?"

176075671,"I have a friend who which upon every time we met would make a joke about me having been mentally ill and having been commited. Not in a sinister manner though. I used to laugh along with him. Got to have some self irony, but it started to get annoying because it was literally every time we met. So one time I just didn’t laugh or make no positive expression when he made the joke comment. I think he understood that it was a little bit funny the first times…but not anymore."
176075672,Risperidone did the same to me when I was on tablets. But I don’t have that problem with the injection of risperidone consta.
176075673,I got my results and all is clear which is good and bad because now I have no answers. I’m getting frustrated.
174361232,No what happened was my doctor switched me over to Vraylar and it didn’t work on me. She switched me back to Risperdal but at this point I was too psychotic to take my meds the right way. I ended up being hospitalized involuntarily
176075674,Are you at home alone with noone to seek help from? Scream all you want and people will bring you to see doctors soon or police might come if you keep staying in your house to capture you for treatment

Also removing my ex from my life made me not near as stressed, no religion, no ex, I’m good to go, maybe hell was talking about the relationship with my ex I don’t know P.s I’ve never met anyone who died and came back to tell us hell was a real place, just try and focus on enjoying life as much as u can, and I’ll try and do the same, from our point of view, when your dead you’re gone"

176075679,I take 400mg a day. It helps a bit but not nearly enough. I don’t want to take it anymore.
174361240,"Thank you for the replies, everyone. I really appreciate the advice and feedback. I have thought about getting her involuntarily hospitalized, but if it is unsuccessful, she’d no longer trust me. Maybe even think I’m evil, too. She has already approached me before about making sure I’m “a good person” and that I’m making the right choices in my life. To me, that sounds like she is already being told by the voices or delusions that I’m possibly evil or becoming evil. I just feel like I’m walking on thin ice. Last time I saw her, we got in an argument. She asked me if I still hear and see things. I responded that yes, I’m schizoaffective, as she knows… She went on to say that no, I’m gifted by God, like her. I told her that no, she has schizophrenia and that she is not truly hearing God. She got very upset and said I don’t appreciate her gifts, just like my dad didn’t. I’m afraid that means she’s going to start pushing me away if I argue with her anymore. I want to hospi
talize her so that she can get proper medication and help for these severe delusions and hallucinations, but I’m afraid of losing her. _AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_"

I told her I wanted to marry her and I was a lab rat. She said it just wasn’t good enough and she wanted a diamond ring. She was born in Britain and grew up in the New York where she still has family, she says she comes from a rich family with many maids and servants. She’s a really good laywer and strongly believes in the Bible saying that every time she reads it she feels like _NAME_, she says Islam is a Catholic conspiracy, I’m a strong believer in the truth, everything else is either a story or a profile.

Schizophrenia.com has been taking up all my mental time and space, and in some ways that has been good, but it hasn’t really helped. It did motivate me to make a serious effort to move away from being a “ward of the state”, but my attempts were totally unrealistic apparently, it was basically felt that I had nothing to bring to the table. Last year I was working as a health economics research assistant at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine which didn’t go so well as I relapsed. I’d like to try and work as some kind of research assistant again, but I don’t know in what field. I arrogantly think I can apply myself to anything just because I can apply mathematics and insightful reasoning to it, but good research requires meticulousness and focus, which I lack. I’m waiting to see if anyo
ne gets back to me about some form of collaboration on a project, but I’m not hopeful. I think I just have settle down again to some meditation and contemplation, off schizophrenia.com, so I can do my shiatsu theory course to the best of my ability. The problem is it’s just too addictive. I’ll try to make sure I only post here, if I’m going to post at all, and stay focused on my goals. Thank you."

176075690,"When I am at work versus when I am at home. When I am at work I can handle a million things at once, I get things done without even thinking about it. At home I can have meltdowns over having to perform the smallest, simplest tasks. For example once at home I had a meltdown literally in tears about having to go walk to a different room to use the printer. (For no known reason, it just seemed to be such a huge impossible task). At work the fax machine breaks all the time and I have to walk to another unit to send a fax. I do it without even thinking about it. I am totally normal. I can be at work filling out doctors orders, working with freaking out patients, discharging and admitting, giving meds, etc. And at home I struggle to brush my teeth and shower and take dishes to the kitchen. Why am I like this?? It is like I have a completely different brain when at work versus home. At work I am high functioning and very skilled at what I do. At home I am so low functioning you would think I could never 
hold a job and often have to have my boyfriend help take care of me. Seriously, it makes no sense whatsoever."

I went to therapy because of it and tried three different antidepressants but nothing worked. What actually is kinda new: I’ve has a lot of dark and intrusive thoughts lately and urges for destructive behaviour. I’m constantly fighting the urge to hurt myself. Doesn’t always work. I’m just tired of being myself. Of things in general. I’m feeling really unstable."

I have poor short-term memory but good long-term memory.

There are some practical ideas and some very complex ideas which I think are really quite simple if only they could be expressed in such a way. The first thing that comes to my mind is that attachments are delusions, and I think this helps with reading the text. Being someone with a religious ideology, he is trying to balance between guiding you towards an extreme ideal, no attachments, and making you see that attachments are delusions and delusions are attachments. I think the latter statement can be helpful to people with schizophrenia, but trying to give up all attachments (or delusions) is for monks and nuns, not functional people in society."

L-theanine (200 mg/day) or placebo tablets were randomly assigned to participants for 4 weeks administration. After 2 weeks of wash-out period, the crossover study was continued for 4 weeks. Stress related symptoms were assessed using Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Cognitive functions were as
sessed with Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS).SDS, STAI-trait, and PSQI scores significantly decreased after 4 weeks of L-theanine administration, while there were no significant changes after placebo. Verbal fluency and executive function scores of BACS significantly increased (p = 0.001 and 0.031) after L-theanine, but not placebo, administration. Changes in sleep latency, sleep disturbance, and use of sleep medication subscales of PSQI were significantly better in the L-theanine than in the placebo group. Changes in SDS and PSQI total scores also tended to be better in L-theanine than in placebo group. The rate of individuals who showed an improvement in BACS executive function score (5 or more) was significantly greater in L-theanine group than in placebo group. There was no significant adverse event after chronic L-theanine administration.The results suggest that 4 weeks of L-theanine (200 mg/day) administration is safe and effective on stress-related symptoms and cognitive functions

174361274,"“Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons in the brain of both schizophrenic patients and animal models indicates that impairment of _USER_ID_ function is implicated in pathophysiology of the disorder. Decreased _USER_ID_ neurotransmission might be also involved in cognitive impairment, which is developed in schizophrenia.” So I wanted to see what GABA was, and it looks like you can also buy it as a supplement, thought this was worth sharing. Also, going to try to find out what trigger GABA production. _USER_ID_: according to Mr. _PERSON_, the GABA supplements don’t cross the blood brain barrier, so a better path might be to find what triggers GABA production. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of pre- and post-treatment with Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi) on phencyclidine-induced disruptions in object recognition memory and cerebral calbindin, parvalbumin, and calretinin immunoreactivity in rats. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment , 2019 Background: Decrease
d gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons in the brain of both schizophrenic patients and animal models indicates that impairment of _USER_ID_ function is implicated in pathophysiology of the disorder. Decreased _USER_ID_ neurotransmission might be also involved in cognitive impairment, which is developed in schizophrenia. Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) could be a new treatment and prevention for this cognitive deficit in schizophrenia by increasing _USER_ID_ neurons to a normal level. Aim: The authors aimed to study cognitive-enhancement- and neuroprotective-effects of Brahmi on novel object recognition memory and _USER_ID_ neuronal density, defined by the presence of calcium binding proteins (CBPs; calbindin (CB), parvalbumin (PV), and calretinin (CR)) in a sub-chronic (2 mg/kg, Bid, ip) phencyclidine (PCP) rat model of schizophrenia. Materials and methods: In the cognitive-enhancement-effect study rats were assigned to three groups; Group-1: Control, Group-2: PCP-administration, and Group-3: PCP+Brahmi. In 
the neuroprotective-effect study rats were assigned to three groups; Group-1: Control, Group-2: PCP-administration, and Group-3: Brahmi+PCP. A discrimination ratio (DR) representing cognitive ability was obtained from the novel object recognition task. CB, PV, and CR immunodensity were measured in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and cornuammonis fields 1-3 (CA1-3) using immunohistochemistry. Results: Reduced DR was found in the PCP group, which occurred alongside reduced CB, PV, and CR in all brain regions except for CR in the striatum and CA1-3 in the cognitive-enhancement-effect study. PCP+Brahmi showed a higher DR score with increased CB in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, increased PV in the prefrontal cortex and CA1-3, and increased CR in the prefrontal cortex. The Brahmi+PCP group showed higher DR score with increased CB in all areas, increased PV in the striatum, and increased CR in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated the effects, both partial restoration 
of cognitive deficit and neuroprotection, of Brahmi, and elucidated its underlying mechanism of actions via increasing _USER_ID_ neurons in a PCP-induced schizophrenic-like model."

I was last at that point in 2016. So ultimately I’d like to loose 97 pounds. Might as well call that 100. Geez that’s a lot I’m starting today with the diet. Going to be counting calories and trying to stick to 1500 a day which with Geodon is going to be hard because that means I need 500 for breakfast and dinner which only leaves 500 to split between lunch and snacks.

176075875,"I suffer from recurring suicidal thoughts. I’ve tried to kill myself 10 times usually with whatever pills I can get my hands on (I’m afraid of pain) Some attempts were half-assed cries for help. Some attempts were in response to command hallucinations. Some were close calls and I ended up in the ICU. Today I can say I’m glad I’m not dead. I’m glad I failed. I made it through. I somehow found the strength to change my situation. I left my husband. Quit using drugs. Quit smoking cigarettes. And just got referred to a life skills program that will help me lose weight with a nutritionist and personal trainer. All of this change has happened in the last few months even though the planning was a year in the making. My point is you can change your situation and effect your suicidality to a degree. If you have plans, you are less likely to want to kill yourself. And if you are spending effort taking care of yourself you are less likely to want to harm yourself.

Spending will be very high in the coming years (well, we are talking about the economy, but also people.). We are already talking about a recession here. We will see what the future holds for us.

But look at them after work or look at them as professionals who have to treat everyone differently and offer care to those who have specific propblems or cases. We may be feeling , loving, seeing machines who care. We are flesh and blood machines. We break, have relationships, adore beauty, have a life, have fun, get smart, doodle. A real machine can’t do some of those. It is very confusing though to be cloned or have fake animals. They don’t feel they just take orders.

176075889,"Even now that I am normal, I don’t think I have an empirical foundation to my belief in others and myself. I am very opaque, difficult to grasp, and other people are similar to people on TV. However, I think that there are feelings that I don’t want to have, a variety of them, that keep me normal. I don’t want to feel loneliness, loss of all romance, sense of waste (of my life), sense of being selfish (and having harmed the people I have loved – like in the the movie “Angel Heart”), having continuously indulged in autoeroticism, pedophilia, homosexuality, incestuality, perhaps in a sense bestiality, minisculeness / giantness, inside-out-ness, and strange prophetic, circular, or back-to-front temporality. I think that the sexual stuff and the vastness I should be able to cope with but it may be the temporal feelings that I wish to avoid. I want to feel that there is something that I can do, so I want to avoid the feeling that everything has already happened, will repeat, and can’t be c

ANYTHING is addictive if you use it enough. And the month of detoxing I went through wasn’t all in my head. I was shaking, throwing up, sleeping poorly and having nightmares when I finally did sleep, getting sad for no reason, getting angry for no reason, dissociating, and having panic attacks. Everything hurt. I made a promise to myself to never ever put myself through that again. I know if I have one toke I have to start all over. And I’ve kept that promise. After the first year of being clean, I bought myself a tattoo. It’s poorly done, but it’s a reminder of what I went through and I love it. When things get tough, I look at it and remember how proud I was when I’d finally gone a whole year without smoking up. I also abused alcohol. Not enough to be an alcoholic, but there was definitely misuse. Now I rarely drink. I maybe have a beer 
or a glass of wine every 3 months or so. Can’t even remember the last time I got drunk, and my alcohol mentality has shifted also. I no longer drink to get drunk, I just have a sip to enjoy the sip."

Kind of hint around that mental illness is serious but not hopeless. And that’s the truth. Tell the girl that mental illness makes some things in life hard but she can still have goals and live mostly a normal life. Tell her both your diseases are different than each other so each disease has it’s own special problems. Say to her that it will be hard living with a mental illness but mental illness is treatable and with the right treatment, she can get better and manage the symptoms. Teens are smart, tell her straight up the challenges she will face so she will understand. Just pepper in some positive news along with the bad news."

176076022,That’s really tough _AT_MENTION_ . I’ve been freaking out about stuff lately. And like you I need to be careful about how religious I let myself be. It’s s fine line.

174361331,"I am schizophrenic and I collect taxes for the IRS. Its kind of hard to learn though. I have had a lot of jobs while sick and they all paid pretty well. I did my last four years in the Marine Corps with schizophrenia and I planned counternarcotics, anti alien smuggling and counter terrorism operations but I got fired from that a few times. They would take all the stress off of me for a while and then said I was better and would load me up with stress again. It took a lot out of me. I failed a lot. Then I was the second in command for a school. I was a senior field grade officer when I got sick. I refused to go to the wounded warrior brigade because I wasn’t injured in combat so they gave me that job until I was medically retired. When I got out of the Marine Corps I became a career counselor for soldiers getting out of the Army and got to work with the wounded warriors. Then I went to be an exercise designer for the Marine Corps. Didn’t last too long at that. Then I became an Assistant Manager 
at WalMart. Then an aircraft mechanic. Then an aviation subject matter expert for the Marine Corps doing exercises again. And then I became a field manager for the US Census Bureau. And now I collect taxes. None of those were entry level jobs so you can do whatever your experience and education will allow. I did work as a security guard for a bit too. That didn’t pay too well. Getting jobs is easy. It’s keeping one that’s hard. You might have to try several things before you find your niche."

I have heard that aging can better BPD. I have known people with BPD who was very ill when young and got very much better. I hope you find some help.

Now I’m out working and functioning in the community and living a good life, but doing so as someone who is med-compliant. There is definitely hope. Welcome to the community."

176076068,"Abstract The current management of patients with primary psychosis worldwide is often remarkably stereotyped. In almost all cases an antipsychotic medica­tion is prescribed, with second?generation antipsychotics usually preferred to first?generation ones. Cognitive behavioral therapy is rarely used in the vast majority of countries, although there is evidence to support its efficacy. Psychosocial interventions are often provided, especially in chronic cases, but those applied are frequently not validated by research. Evidence?based family interventions and supported employment programs are seldom implemented in ordinary practice. Although the notion that patients with primary psychosis are at increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus is widely shared, it is not frequent that appropriate measures be implemented to address this problem. The view that the management of the patient with primary psychosis should be personalized is endorsed by the vast majority of clinicians, but 
this personalization is lacking or inadequate in most clinical contexts. Although many mental health services would declare themselves “recovery?oriented”, it is not common that a focus on empowerment, identity, meaning and resilience is ensured in ordinary practice. The present paper aims to address this situation. It describes systematically the salient domains that should be considered in the characterization of the individual patient with primary psychosis aimed at personalization of management. These include positive and negative symptom dimensions, other psychopathological components, onset and course, neurocognition and social cognition, neurodevelopmental indicators; social functioning, quality of life and unmet needs; clinical staging, antecedent and concomitant psychiatric conditions, physical comorbidities, family history, history of obstetric complications, early and recent environmental exposures, protective factors and resilience, and internalized _USER_ID_. For each domain, simple assessmen
t instruments are identified that could be considered for use in clinical practice and included in standardized decision tools. A management of primary psychosis is encouraged which takes into account all the available treatment modalities whose efficacy is supported by research evidence, selects and modulates them in the individual patient on the basis of the clinical characterization, addresses the patient’s needs in terms of employment, housing, self?care, social relationships and education, and offers a focus on identity, meaning and resilience. https://onlinelibrary._NAME_.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20809#.YALuRGNSJK8.twitter"

176076076,"One way to look at it is if the car repair is a necessity. You don’t want to put off an important repair because when a car needs work, a lot of times if you don’t take care of it right away, not only does the problem get worse but it usually gets more expensive. And if the jacket doesn’t fit why would you want it? I don’t know what’s wrong with your car but I think fixing your car would be more of a priority then a new jacket."
176076077,Are they smart and intelligent?
174361341,"For me personally I found the best way out of psychosis and paranoia except for medication is to work with yourself to find peace and calm in your heart and mind. Work out what makes you feel secure and try to work out the triggers that makes you feel unsecure. Start with your own home. If you feel that you need more privacy maybe get thick curtains for the windows. If you feel unsecure, get a door chain or a extra padlock for your door. If there is something that doesen’t feel right in your home, try redecorating your furniture to make a new impression or new sensation of your home. Are there certain foods or drinks that triggers something in your mind? Even this is possible. I got superparnoid when I used to take valerian root, it took a while to work that out. Are you getting overstimulated by social and visual media? Getting too involved in this can put you in a trance like state where you forget about your own life. I am just learning this myself. It is scary because when the visual stuff is 
gone I am suddenly much more in touch with my own life and reality. I listen to the radio though, that helps. I could always go back to visual media later if it is too hard to stay away. If you get irrational thoughts try to put it in a objective context and compare yourself with your family, friends or neighbours. Would these kind of things happen to them, and if so what would they think or do about it? Do they seem fine? Most people get along living this life, so why shouldn’t you? I hope you find a way to recover."

176076081,"This is really big news for me. When I started my business I estimated I had 9 months to survive assuming no work and burning through my savings. Now I am earning a respectable amount of money that even goes as far as covering off my ‘off days’ financially, which I never got at my office job I left in March Mentally I am doing a lot better being my own boss. I literally have no pressure or politics to deal with. The turning point was really when I joined a verified tradesman site for my marketing, which although is expensive, I would not have a business without all the leads it generates. Was a big risk doing this, but it paid off. Literally, I was thinking I’d be back behind a desk facing the same problems. I gave the business a 10% chance of survival when I decided to do it over Nursing. Now I am in a traditionally quiet time of year for landscaping, and I am booked until spring, with the expectation enquires will pick up again from there on. My reason for posting this successful news is th
at I am so surprised and had no clue it could turn out this way. I hope to encourage others to give something like this a try. Going from where I was mentally in March to this is just unbelievable, and I am more hopeful for the future now with this being a secure employment, as I was trapped in my office job by salary and a mistaken belief that I needed the job security that self-employment could not offer me in my head. Seriously, working for yourself is great. I worked not even 3 full days this week, and I pretty much made the same I would have at my office job, and I was able to work in such a way that when I was feeling a bit off as my prescription was delayed (another story) I had the flexibility to say enough, go home and relax. Customers are not too bothered by this I find, as I work to a fixed price and not a day rate, so it’s all pre-agreed and deposits of up to 60% are all paid up for everything! I am so thankful for this, as I really was in such a state over my old job, and really making that dec

I feel so much better being outside in the fresh air, doing creative stuff and building some things for people that they’re truly impressed with. I got this feedback today online: “***** is a very professional landscaper all work done to detail, everything was explained in full detail before work started, very clean and tidy, fully satisfied with the out come of the design of our garden, very good price.” This may or may not resonate with you right now, but there is hope.

176076123,These sites messed with my head. I never had a relationship at around 30 so I chose this route. I have some regrets and so many stories. I revealed my DX to people way too early… Majority of people already made up their minds about me before meeting me … Many ghosted me and blocked me. I didn’t know how to react to those situations…and I’m sensitive as it is it really effected me emotionally. I met my partner online but if I didn’t I would probably still be on those sites in a far worst position than before.

There was also a recent discovery that immune rejection of induced stem cells, either “off the shelf” or a person’s own, was being caused by mutations to the mitochondria, which was being caused by the process of generating the iPSCs. So they are now working on ways to reduce that or screen the cells and remove the ones that could cause an immune response. Seems like a huge job. But they’re working on it."

She had a medical past of recurrent vomiting during pregnancy, and an esophagectomy with partial gastrectomy due to idiopathic achalasia three years before presentation. Her brain MRI was unremarkable. She was evaluated by otorhinolaryngology team and was discharged with diagnosis of bilateral vestibular neuritis. After one week, she returned with behavioral change. Her neurologic examination revealed restricted extraocular motility to lateral gaze, ve
rtical nystagmus, _PERSON_ sign and dysarthria. Cognitive deficits appeared days before admission and she quickly became catatonic. Initial laboratory tests were normal. Brain MRI showed increased signal in FLAIR sequence involving mammillary bodies, periaqueductal area, and periventricular region of the third ventricle. A clinical suspicion of thiamine deficiency was considered, treatment with parenteral thiamine was started, and rapidly improvement in catatonia and ocular motility was seen. Although the classic neurologic manifestation of thiamine deficiency is _PERSON_ encephalopathy triad, patients may not fulfill the classic phenotype of ocular dysmotility, gait ataxia, and mental status changes in early presentations of the disease. Additionally, MRI may not be abnormal and can change over the course of disease. The classic signs of catatonia, which were lush in this case report, may be found in neurologic metabolic disorders, but is not described as a classic finding in thiamine deficiency. In this cas
e report, in addition to catatonia as an atypical manifestation, there was resolution of this phenotype after thiamine replacement."

I thought he was going to come back at me with a knife or something, but he never did. No one wants to go to jail, with todays technology it is very hard to get away with serious crime.

176076347,"It sounds like now is the time to go to the hospital, then. While you still have insight. If you still don’t want to, some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts

Intrusive thoughts, depression and stupid suicide ideations (i’m not reacting to them or in danger) And now i’m craving alcohol like ever before. I just want a big, strong beer to get rid of the bad mood, but i guess, it’s not an good idea to begin drinking, as long as you still got the craving. I just have to go through this episode, and come out sober."
174361403,"It is not even sedation, I would name it suckening of your life force. I feel like I am dying in every few hours after I take Clozapine. I know it happens with other APs like Olanzapine. Is there any supplement, drug or anything else beside lying down to sleep the worst of it?"
176076382,"What we seem to have forgotten, is that the earth and its resources are finite… Limited. You can’t take a dump in the bath water, and expect it to just disappear. Sorry, a little graphic but you get the point. Over 100 Years of industrial revolution has brought us to the point where change is necessary. How do we do that? I’m not sure. Since it is a global problem, it would have to be regulated by the UN, government legislature and personal choices all working together Just my thoughts on the matter"
176076383,I never thought about my life. It was always push come to shove. I felt so unwanted and unloved.
176076384,I felt a little better each time I would go down in dose I feel closer to normal just lack of motivation still but I know for some people there symptoms show through if they go low so to each his own

174361410,"Is your positive symptoms that much strong to take these kind of strong APs like amisulpride, clozapine etc? These drugs are not prescribed usually due to severe side effects and only prescribed when others fail. Need to discuss with pdoc regarding side effects and ask him/her to try other APs which have minimal side effects. It may or may not work but keep testing as these drugs carry several side effects in the long run."

Also, an enemy of mine who shall remain nameless took the opportunity to use this situation to work against me and hurt my reputation. I was not in my right mind and did not handle things properly. The ramifications of this for the present and future are tremendous. It is a truly sad and difficult situation and this is a small part of trying to find acceptance."

176076405,A lot of ERs have an advice phone number where you can call and speak with a nurse. Maybe they would be willing to just get you a Rx for antibiotics without having to see you in person.

174361414,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Clozapine and the Course of Bipolar Disorder in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and PVS Magalhaes, Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie, Jan 21 2020 The potential of clozapine in severe bipolar disorder is suggested by its efficacy in refractory schizophrenia, but the evidence is limited thus far. This report utilizes data from the standard care pathway of the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program to examine the clinical impact of clozapine in bipolar disorder, comparing it to two groups, one that received olanzapine and an additional group that received neither drug.A total of 4,032 outpatients were available for this analysis. Groups for longitudinal analyses are based on the medication used at each visit. Outcomes assessed were clinical status, symptoms subscales, hospitalizations, and death. We utilized mixed models and generalized estimating equations to 
adjust for baseline differences and investigate longitudinal differences in symptoms, clinical status, and hospitalization rates between groups.During the study, 1.1% (n = 43) of the patients used clozapine at any time. Those on clozapine had significantly fewer manic and depressive symptoms during follow-up as compared with those on neither clozapine nor olanzapine, while those on olanzapine had more symptoms. The use of clozapine was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. No deaths were recorded for clozapine group during the trial.Although prescribed to very few patients, the impact of clozapine was notable, with fewer symptoms in patients who had more severe illnesses at baseline. Clozapine could prove to be as successful an intervention for late-stage bipolar disorder as it has been in schizophrenia."
176076423,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ that was a great read. I can tell you are being genuinely authentic. Time to shine a little light in the shadows I think everyone has had a patch of depression, where it felt like no one cared and no one liked us. That is the depression talking. Think of it as of long slow gentle uphill walk. It doesn’t seem like you’re getting anywhere, but if you check back with yourself in three months you realize you’ve improved. That’s what it was like for me recovering from deep depression anyway Got to get your head above water first, before tackling the big questions. Just my thoughts"
176076424,"no not yet, I need some advice and guidance"
176076425,"I ask myself if anything remotely close to my elaborate and preposterous fear has ever happened before in the news. Some may not be able to take heart. So I’ll add a personal thing: I thought there was a slightest of chances that an old jaded guy who I made a transgression toward in business would exact revenge 10 years after the fact and target a loved one. People though, don’t do that. And plus, ‘when it’s all said and done, a lot more gets said, than done.’ And this is the best of me! I forgave him on Social media… it’s over for me. I’m free. I’m here to help now!"

176076428,"I started the fire That exploded the stars I raised my hand And the river flooded the lands. The great catastrophe has begun I am its maker, its master, its god. The earth shakes beneath you Because of my command It cracks and falls to nothing below. Your homes swallowed by the fertile soil And ripped to shreds by the darkened sky My voice rings out “I rule the heavens and earth below.” Fall down before me. I will destroy your lands and your family And all that you possess. Then you will run to me and offer up your sacrifice When I am pleased with an offering I am benevolent When you do not give me your finest I will know because I can see Deep inside you. I know you to the depth of your soul. Come away and bring with you my gift We shall see what your fate will be. Shall you fall into the never ending _NAME_. Or will you fly above the stars. Kneel."
176076429,"I just threw around my diet from junk to healthy. This is what seems to be working for me: I first made a few smaller steps: Drink only water, and enough of it. Dont skip breakfast. Always cook, no takeaway, even if it is the simplest cooking. These were my weakest spots. These changes gave me more energy and joy to change my diet more radically. Id say find yours to change step by step. We (_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_) are doing a sugar challenge now here on the forum. I threw out all junk and just buy whole food. It starts in the (super)market: I just buy organic meat, fish, fresh veggies and fruit, fresh herbs, etc. I quit sugar, all added nonsense and gluten (i was recommended the latter by a doc). I just buy whole things and learn by trying and reading (internet, books) to cook with it. I hope i will get better in time. It is fun and i feel better. Hope you will find something that works!"

176076463,"If your daughter was laid off, then she can get unemployment benefits. No matter how low her original payment plan is, there should be an additional $600 payment per week for the next 2-3 months. If there was any other reason(like her getting sick, a bad work environment, or an act of good faith[doing something that really mean’t well for the business, but because of some reason, the ‘certified’ person wasn’t available, or perhaps she just mean’t well in what she did]), then she’ll be eligible, but may have to fight it in a hearing for this(she can get lawyer for this, at least for $100-200 dollars). Do you go to _NAME_’s Club or Costco? Because that will help you alot in your food situation. Buying bulk can save alot of money. If forgot the membership cost(I haven’t used it in a while, but you only need one membership per household(I think) to purchase groceries there.

176076468,"I think that they are taking rather aggressive stance on everyone who is recipient of social welfare in UK/EU (so at least that’s what I’ve heard from someone a while ago). I won’t go into the details because I don’t know if the information that person provided me is accurate. The default aggressive stance in psychiatry I think it’s because there are excessive cases of hypochondriacs and individuals who are trying claim benefits that perhaps otherwise not always would qualify for it. I suspect that the default aggressive stance is the norm in psychiatry field nowadays. The nurse who spoke with you is a very good example of it. Acting like a trained assassin is her job, and I’m sorry to hear that you had to experience that. The feeling is mutual. I was once denied referral by a general practitioner to visit psychiatrist. I told the GP about my symptoms and that I was homeless living on streets, also suicidal, and having some sort of psychotic symptoms. I said to him that I needed to see 
psychiatrist because I was actually going bonkers. The GP told me that there is nothing wrong with me and that he won’t be giving me any referral. Later my situation has spiraled down and I ended up with an emergency admission anyway. So the GP did failed at the basic task. I only asked to a referral to be checked by psychiatrist. I won’t bore you with the details. It’s very unfortunate that they’ve been unhelpful towards you. I hope that you get the help you need very soon."

As this signaling pathway is critically linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, especially in the context of working-memory dysfunction, spironolactone may be a novel treatment option for patients with schizophrenia targeting cognitive impa
irments.To evaluate whether spironolactone added to an ongoing antipsychotic treatment improves cognitive functioning in schizophrenia.The add-on spironolactone for the treatment of schizophrenia trial (SPIRO-TREAT) is a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial with three arms (spironolactone 100 mg, spironolactone 200 mg and placebo). Schizophrenia patients are treated for three weeks and then followed-up for additional nine weeks. As primary outcome, we investigate changes in working memory before and at the end of the intervention phase. We will randomize 90 patients. Eighty-one patients are intended to reach the primary endpoint measure at the end of the three-week intervention period. Secondary endpoints include other measures of cognition, psychopathology, safety measures and biological measures.SPIRO-TREAT is the first study evaluating the efficacy of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone to improve cognitive impairments in schizophrenia patients targeting the NRG1-ERBB4 sign

With SPIRO-TREAT, we intend to investigate a novel treatment option for cognitive impairments in schizophrenia that goes beyond the established concepts of interfering with dopaminergic neurotransmission as key pathway in schizophrenia treatment.International Clinical Trials Registry Platform: http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=EUCTR2014-001968-35-DE."

176076515,I’ve never heard of this. Isn’t an experience I’ve had with or without AP’s. Are you going to see a doctor or your pdoc soon? Maybe worth just running by them.

176076524,"Hello, I think you can become a psychiatrist if you manage your symptoms well enough. I also am an MD and My psychiatrist (private) wants me to become a psychiatrist but I just told him it’s a possibility. I’ve heard of sz doctors all over the world even in the US (from _PERSON_) also surgeons believe it or not. For now I am pursuing a theology post graduate degree to become a Counsellor and an author. It would be nice to do something on the sidelines too just in case the workload of medicine is too much for you. The good thing is that you have options, but I think you can do it with a good strategy, support and excellent coping skills."

I mean it does matter to me that they got the label right and right now I’m not being told I have Bipolar. It matters because the diseases are different, and I want to know the different symptoms. Still debating getting a new psychiatrist but I couldn’t get any transportation to fill out the paperwork. I tried a lyft and even that didn’t work out. Then finally the pdoc called and said ok the Prozac is out of you’re system so dont take it anymore. No further explanation. He sighed, I felt like I was bothering him…I dont know, why do I have to feel like a burden because I think for myself. There is something messed up if I was always Bipolar1 and I was put on all the meds that made me hear voices to be called schizophrenic, and doesn’t this prove it?"

176076543,Welcome back 15
176076544,I was a day late. All my kids were late
176076545,Depends on the show/movie. It’s hard to find realistic things to do with mental illness. Still. Some things aren’t too badly handled. I didn’t mind A Beautiful Mind. I thought that had some humanity and the movie Angel Baby was well done… I don’t watch a lot of films/tv these days so I might be out of the loop but it’s not triggering. If I would feel uncomfortable I’d just stop watching it…

Im always welcome at the neighbours for a cup of tea, but with covid, ive stopped that, and dont want to annoy them every five minutes. I just sleep alot - and have an interest in computers (tho not very good) so that keeps me occupied most of the time. Im not always great with the public anyway at times - so im usually sat in front of a screen 12-15 hours a day. Not easy living alone - but ive learnt to live with it. And im actually quite comfortable in my “man-cave” living and sleeping in 1 large room - so its not too bad."
176076548,life is hard. the voices bother me a whole lot today. for the first time i felt like maybe i should retire from work early even though i cannot afford to at all. i keep feeling like i want to cry but thank goodness i don’t cry now. also i feel sooo tired physically emotionally and mentally. have any of you experienced anything like this? _NAME_

176076554,I guess you go with what I’ve thought for awhile: Take the minimum dose that keeps you from having Psychosis and keeps the side effects from the Ap’s to a minimum. Thats the conclusion I keep coming back to.

When it’s not currently blank, there can be a voice talking, fake thoughts (things that do not feel like your own thoughts) or mental images produced by my schizophrenia My emotions and old feelings are gone. Now I feel bad feelings, every day (they’re new feelings, ones I never felt before having schizophrenia). I was tortured badly for 8 months while I was in the hospital, now the feelings are more tolerable, or short lived (the feelings are being turned on and off). That sums my current experience up pretty much. My past experiences have been wiped away from my memory. Many strange things happened during that time, which I only know from the notes I have written and from what my relatives have told me."

176076597,No it is likely as i experienced psychosis on them the second day I started and I was off antipsychotics for months before that… the antidepressant caused it but then they still increased it… had to wait for it to be out of my system before they gave me an antipsychotic again…

The current study aimed to determine the strongest neuropsychological and other modifiable predictors of work outcomes in 153 people with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, 38%; bipolar disorder, 24%; and major depression, 38%) who participated in a 2-year supported employment study.Assessments of neuropsychological performance, functional capacity, social skills, and psychiatric symptom severity were administered at baseline; work outcomes (job attainment, weeks worked, and wages earned) were collected weekly for 2 years.Independent of education, diagnosis, and estimated intellectual functioning, more r
ecent work history and less severe negative symptoms significantly predicted job attainment during the 2-year study. Among the 47% who obtained jobs, better global neuropsychological performance (i.e., lower global deficit score) was a significant predictor of greater weeks worked. Both global neuropsychological performance and more recent work history predicted higher wages earned.Modifiable predictors of supported employment outcomes included cognitive functioning and negative symptom severity; thus, interventions to improve these factors may improve work outcomes and decrease the loss of productivity associated with severe mental illness."

I just feel… Happy. Content, almost. It could be that my meds are working, as I don’t feel overly charged or inappropriately emotional. It could be that I’m just having a good time for once and I should just ride the wave while it’s there. Do I have reason to be concerned? I’m not going hypomanic or something am I?"

My work fluctuates between low and heavy workloads with little notice and I miss having a job that was more of a routine, to some extent. Having suspense is sometimes good sometimes bad, I feel life is all chasing around both routine and suspense. One moment you want routine then you get it and hate it and want something more unpredictable then you have that and get tired of it too. It may just be an issue with brain chemistry but I can’t seem to find something to invest in long term that keeps me happy. I was in a much better mood last week, I have a good life I just want to be able to enjoy it more, there is no real reason for me being depressed unless I want to keep dwelling and hate everything.

176076678,I’m sorry you’re feeling depressed too
174361489,_AT_MENTION_ . Clozapine has got to be better than living like this. You said your psychiatrist suggested it. 6-8 weeks inpatient is nothing. The time will fly by. Your current meds aren’t doing much for you from what you’re saying.

174361490,Sometimes I suspect that I’m deliberately wallowing in negative symptoms and that the covert psychological payoff of doing this is that I get to feel sorry for myself all the time. If there was no such thing as self-pity I wonder where I’d be now.

176076682,Welcome back
176076683,Thanks. I appreciate that.
176076684,"I’ve become one of those ‘can do’ people. You wanna know why? Because when I stopped procrastinating things and blaming my illness for my limitations, doing things became so much easier. I was the kind of person who never showed up for anything, never held down a job, just laid in bed and watched youtube videos. I never showered. If someone told me to try harder, I’d get angry and say “I can’t”. With negatives, it’s so easy to get engulfed in it and focus on all the negative. It’s easier to say “I don’t wanna” and “I give up” because trying is hard. I’m not saying it’s easy to “just do it”, but I think a lot of people get too stuck in the mindset that it’s hard. What was hardest for me was getting started. I’d build the tasks up in my head and get the feeling they were gonna be hard and tedious, and then I’d tell myself it would be easier to do it some other time, or that it was ok I didn’t have the energy. Guess what. You gotta spend energy to get energy
. I sleep less now, and better. Why? Because I do things during the day, so I get naturally tired and don’t need sleep aides to numb me enough to go to sleep for 14 hours. I don’t WANT to get up every day and clean the apartment and shower. I don’t WANT to get up at 7 and work until 6, and then go shopping and cook dinner and do the dishes afterwards. But I do it because I have to, and if I procrastinate, things are gonna get worse and take longer to get done. I think we get very good at telling ourselves things are harder than they are, and we get good at telling ourselves we can’t do anything, when in reality, we maybe just don’t want to. That’s what negatives were for me. No physical limitations, just tired easily and an overwhelming feeling of “I don’t wanna”, which it was sometimes easier to give into than challenge. I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna shove my “can do” attitude anywhere, because nothing bugs me more than people sitting on their hind legs going “I can’t so what’s 
the point in trying”"

I have managed to graduate high school with a good matriculation, and managed to complete military service but as of now I am out of studies, without a job, and without capacity to live independently. I could also theoretically worry about my future but I think that by the time I might have to go it alone, in 15-20 years, there will either be a full cure for me or otherwise I might improve enough by then to live on my own. Try to rely on your parents for now and maybe set a goal to slowly improve so that say 20 years from now you will somehow improve enough that you will be able to survive independently."

176076728,"I know they are different, But you can be born with Schizophrenia too right? So its similar in that its not neurotypical. There are some studies that people with Schizophrenia have different brain structures? Isn’t that true of Autism? Also, people with schizophrenia have trouble with communicating emotions or they call it “affect” but people with autism also have something like that, where they don’t communicate or express emotions the same way. People with schizophrenia often have high functioning skills in certain spec. areas, like math, logic, science, art. Not everyone with Autism has a photographic genius memory just like not everyone with Schizophrenia is good at physics or abstract math, but I’m just pointing out that they are both non-neurotypical and they both have strengths too. I dont think schizophrenia can always be demonized as something without strengths and gifts as well…and I’m not sure why we always have to medicate someone with schizophrenia, because there are peop
le who feel it takes away their gifts sometimes. I’m not even on that high dose of a medication, so why does it have to be so black/white. If I can live a normal functional life without treating the “chemical imbalance” why isn’t Autism called a “chemical balance”… How exactly is it different that a person with Autism gets to call it something else, but someone with schizophrenia has to call it a chemical imbalance. Aren’t they both genetic and aren’t we born with them, and neither can be reversed or cured."

176076736,He might but not likely
176076737,"I would have a good talk with my pdoc if I were you _AT_MENTION_. Does your depression ever get so bad that you get suicidal or homicidal? If so, you need to be on some kind of AD and/or mood stabilizer for sure."

174361502,"Aww, I don’t think you’re bad."
176076747,"I faced years of sexual abuse starting before I was in preschool. I’m still traumatized and still processing it. I want you to know that there is absolutely NOTHING about your situation for anyone to judge you for. Abuse is something that will only ever be the abusers fault. They decided to abuse you. Not you. I am so sorry you dealt with that. And I’m sorry you’re hurting… Idk if that hurt ever goes away, but I’ve learned talking about it and taking time to process it helps. Please reach out to your pdoc or mental health team about this when you’re ready. I’m wishing you the best in your recovery friend."

176076757,"I think that going into the workforce with the mindset of “I’m disabled” is setting yourself up for failure. You have strengths and needs, like every other worker. So look at jobs that suit your strengths. You could teach piano. That’s a fairly easy job to start out. There are sites that allow you to find students who pay you through the site and it’s all freelance. You could do a factory job. You could do whatever seems interesting to you. I will say that any job really depends on your managers and your coworkers. The scariest job I ever had was also the greatest, because I worked with an amazing team. The easiest job I had made me miserable, because my boss was such a jerk. It really depends on your teammates."
176076758,Yes I take my medication but I still hear the tv talking about me. I also still hear people around me talking about me. So you mean to tell me when I hear people talking about me in the grocery store and I respond I’m talking to myself? Lbs
176076759,Yea you are right I need to do stuff But first I need to overcome the anxiety so that I can actually get out there It gets in the way of everything. Thanks _PERSON_
176076760,Well they have a court order! They wrote down in their notes I was threatening to blow up the bay bridge in sf! But what I was saying when I was yelling was they used cheap foreign steel and that they should blow it up and build a new one! It was a misunderstanding
174361513,Clozapine has made the most difference. I take a combination of Clozapine and Ziprasidone.

176076762,"So my pdoc wrote me a referral letter for state drs whom I’m going to see soon. He mentioned some of my hospitalisations, my sza and borderline diagnosis, the voices, and how they control my mind, panic attacks and depression, my husband’s illness and me wanting to divorce, my episodes of depression and avolition. And that I have “complex psychiatric history” and can’t afford private health care. He also spoke of my meds but instead of saying amisulpride 400mg, he said 400mg twice a day (800mg!) I don’t know how he came on 800! I always was prescribed 400. And my olanzapine and lamotrigine. Also antidepressant but I never bought or took it. He forgot to mention my paranoia and cutting but in another previous letter he did so I may take it along to appt as well as this one. My sister sent it to hospital and said they will examine my letter and files from other hospitals and phone me to make appt. I will either go straight to outpatients or to day hospital. The local one is said to be ok. 
And they have 24 hour emergency services so if I need emergency care I can go there. Last night my husband had heated conversation with me on phone (as I may have said last night) and so I blocked him today. I saw he tried to phone me three times and he sent a slightly sarcastic text saying fine I can have my party life and forget him who was there for me for eight years and he just wanted to win over my “beautiful” heart. I told him on texts that I’m sorry I have to leave for sake of my mental health and I don’t hate him but just have to leave. And that I can’t give him what he needs anymore - I’m not a caregiver and don’t have interest in sex, and my illness is hard on him too. He wanted to phone but I didn’t say he can I had some thought insertion today about my sister’s dogs and was wondering if they can read my mind and see _PERSON_’s evil thoughts and his trying to control me. I felt scared. Just a thought… Thanks for bearing with my long post!"
176076763,Keep taking your meds if that is what they prescribed you. Talk to you doctor asap.
174361507,I read my bosses mind and he doesn’t like me. I looked into the future and saw I will be mostly schizophrenic for many more years.

But not sure because I talk about conspiracy theories. I care about people a lot. Just a fantasy. I’m more into learning disabilities and stuff. Like autism and ADHD. I might make a good one or a horrible one. I think I went to med school in a past life a long time ago if you believe in past lives. Some psychiatrists do, surprisingly. Anyways, I also looked into naloxone too or whatever it is called. I had more issues with severe dissociation than schizophrenia in my opinion. Never been a drinker. Just caffeine. I think I dropped out of med school but at least i got in once. Not sure. Memory is super fuzzy."

It’s a combination of bad oral hygiene(constantly forgetting to brush) teeth grinding, and not having seen the dentist as much as I should due to being quite phobic re seeking a dentist . I had mentioned about dentures to my stepdaughter , and she had made an appointment for me , but that was cancelled due to the virus situation .

176076783,"Well, THAT’S depressing! I kind of thought I would remain close to 1400 calories at my maintenance phase. Maybe it won’t be 1600-1700 calories after all, I might just have to stick at 1400 and the weight loss will naturally stop. We’ll see when I get there, I still have 67.5 pounds left to get to 160! I am down 91.5 pounds so far, but I won’t REALLY be impressed until I’m back in one-derland! I really appreciate the comment. I am on Zyprexa, which has one of the worst reputations for weight gain! I need these kinds of warnings, thank you!"
176076784,I used to occasionally take Benadryl (the generic is Diphenhydramine) sometimes at night when I had really itchy skin due to allergies. Benadryl is an antihistamine and makes you quite drowsy so I was usually able to fall asleep pretty quickly.
176076785,I’ve had my voices pretend to be people and I am possessing them. It’s a game. I wouldn’t pay it any mind. I’ve had conversations with mine. It took time though. What do they say when you try to have conversations with them?

176076789,I want to be well and I want to work at it. It helps. Try a place that hires the disabled. Or get a disability pension. Jobs are hard for me. I’ve worked and need money but it is hard to get up to speed. lol

176076790,"Well there are beautiful things and a few beautiful people in my life. Regardless of whether I have consciousness, I won’t be able to do those things or conmunicate with those people. Maybe I won’t know the difference, but I understand the kind of loss I would have now."

Now I weigh over 100 pounds more than I did then. It managed my symptoms, but it was unpleasant to me. I was mildly depressed the whole time."
174361514,"Yeah same here. Gambling even was an issue. I had credit card debt. I did all the drugs out there and got clean from them all but it has been a very long and difficult process. I wish I had never done them. I felt like Abilify made me feel so closed off and I was unhappy so when I tried to fit in it just was too easy to become a prey to others. It was often peer pressure. Because being young diagnosed made me more gullible to others. I overcame that. I don’t necessarily think Abilify is to blame for that though, more circumstantial. Having schizophrenia is hard enough and drugs only make it worse. Including marijuana it worsens it and makes you impulsive too."
176076800,Ok good luck.i hope i can get over it.
174361522,"Psychiatric Times The Need for Speed Psychomotor speed may be a relevant target in studies of the immune system and its impact on the brain in patients with schizophrenia. Abnormalities in basal ganglia circuitry have been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychomotor slowing in schizophrenia.5 Inflammation, which is present in (some) patients with schizophrenia, may represent one pathway that contributes to psychomotor slowing in schizophrenia via alterations in neural activity and dopamine metabolism in the basal ganglia.6,7 _PERSON_ and colleagues8 examined the relationship between inflammatory markers and performance on a battery of psychomotor tasks in patients with schizophrenia and controls. These tasks included pure motor tasks (eg, finger tapping test [FTT]) as well as those requiring more cognitive demand and cortical activity (eg, trail making test [TMT] and symbol coding [SC]), which may allow distinctions between psychomotor speed and psychomotor processing speed. Patients performed 
significantly worse than controls on the FTT, TMT, and SC tasks, but not the RTT. Regarding effects of inflammatory markers on psychomotor task performance after correction for multiple comparisons, for the FTT, there was a significant interaction between diagnosis and: (1) The soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) (dominant and non-dominant), and (2) IL-10 (non-dominant). There was also a significant interaction between diagnosis and IL-10 for the TMT. For the SC tasks, there was a significant interaction between diagnosis and (1) IL-10, (2) sIL-6R, and (3) the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Using principal components analysis, the authors found that the diagnosis by sIL-6R interaction was significantly associated with slower performance on a “motor factor” (comprised of the FTT for both dominant and non-dominant hands). The interactions between diagnosis and (1) tumor necrosis factor (TNF), (2) IL-10, (3) IL-1RA, and (4) the soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2) were significantly associated with slower 
performance on a “psychomotor factor” (comprised on the TMT and SC)."

176076849,My husband and I just moved about 6 wks. ago. It’s difficult making such a big change. I was very anxious at first but it has eased back to a normal level. It just takes a little time. Even good changes can cause anxiety.

176076851,I deal with mild social anxiety which is helped by my medicine. Social connections are invaluable however so I gotta push myself to reach out to others sometimes.
176076852,Thanks _AT_MENTION_.a.schitzo and _AT_MENTION_! I have just been offered a job! Just waiting on some of the details to come through. Thanks everyone for their love and support.
176076853,That’s the way I felt all through January. It’s after getting better now though. I hope it gets better for you soon too.

176076856,"i drink like 2-3 grams a day every day and it does cause or worsen psychological and mental health issues, but it also makes me FEEL AMAZING! But it’s expensive and I need to stop. That’s like 10 monsters + 2 cups of coffee a day."

176076859,You’ve a mountain of wisdom and a good soul. Don’t get tied up in the nastiness. Your a good person and no one can take that from you. It’s always a work in progress but use your wisdom hard won! You’ve so much to add to this group so keep positive. It really is a journey when your sz…
176076860,Right now you have doubt. Congratulations!

176076862,"Thanks for your post, i Already cancelled my flights and only had to pay 230euro for the hotel. All in all it cost me 400 euro to cancel. That Was the first time, it would probably cost more the next time. Maybe I should rethink again, I really don’t want the voices to come back either"
176076863,That sounds great!
176076864,I’m sorry for your loss of dreams. I know that can be really hard. I hope your surgery goes smoothly same recovery isn’t too bad.

176076866,My mother in law had a ghost in her house who wore a white fedora hat. I was the only one who saw him though.
176076867,Yes I think that’s exactly what’s happening. And yes I can call SSI or the program and they will help me with hours I just was water and wanted to know now I’m not actually hired yet. I have an appt July 18th but it’s just too find a job that comfortable with me. That’s what they help with Thanks for the link in checking it out now
176076868,"I think you are talking about something psychological or “psychic”. It is very hard to mess up in that realm. Like you have to be thinking some really dark ????, but even then if it’s just thoughts there isn’t much consequence."
176076869,What is your idea of recovery?? _AT_MENTION_
176076870,I’m actually more in control of my emotions since I got sz. I’ve been mad like twice in the last 6 years. The other option is that it’s because I got out of a toxic relationship. My life before that relationship I was always in control of emotions and never got mad. So much so that a few people even said you just don’t give a ???? about nothing you’re super chill.
176076871,Or take magnesium glycinate

176076873,"My daughter had difficulties when she was a teen and spent some time in group home environments. She made friends there. Learned to follow house rules. Did chores like cooking and cleaning and kept her room clean. She had school and extracurricular activities. Yes, she missed me and her brother, but she was happy and active. It won’t be so bad."
176076874,Ugh stomach viruses suck… I thought you had a cold. Get well soon!
174361537,Too bad because Abilify lowered my prolactin level just by adding it on a little. I the same problem. My levels were really high and pdoc didn’t want it causing issues
176076875,Hope it works well for you in time _AT_MENTION_ . Best of luck.

176076878,Bumping this post
176076879,"No, I just want to hurt myself even more because everyone hates me I don’t deserve to exist because people hate me"
174361541,"I believe people are forms of the Creator. The schizophrenia symptoms make them feel a lot more “interconnected” and “fake” than they seemed when I was normal, but they are still definitely unique, fully capable individuals. I feel that they have souls. I’m like 80-90% out of the crazy hole now though, and that feeling of interconnectedness hasn’t occurred to me in a while. The ticket back to reality is healing the brain."
176076880,"Sorry, I didn’t mean for it to upset anyone."
176076881,Finally got the laundry done. I don’t know why it’s so hard to get motivated. Now I’m waiting for meds to kick in so I can go to sleep if it’s not too late. Sometimes if I stay up too late I just can’t fall asleep at all.
176076882,hope you feel better );
176076883,"You probably wouldn’t like it. It’s a third person shooter by Rockstar Games. I like it, it’s fun. I like playing on Android because it has so many simulators on it. (Gameboy, SNES, Ninetendo, PS1, PS2) I can play Pokemon and GTA on the same device lol."

176076885,Thank you! I’m multitasking and thus failed to notice this sentence. I’ll google it down.
174361543,"I’m currently in the process of switching from Vraylar to Invega. Vraylar had helped some with my negatives, but my negatives have slowly gotten worse over time. I don’t know if Invega will fix me or not, but I’m mostly looking for ways to cope right now with the negatives. I hope Vraylar works well for you."
174361553,"At first a typical AP, if not working then an atypical AP, if not working then a combination of both typical and atypicals or both atypicals, if healed and positive symptoms disappear or coming under control, Then you can take antidepressants and anti anxieties too, for negative symptoms"
176076886,I’m not getting a response from _AT_MENTION_ and I’m worried. Has anyone heard anything?
176076887,"just get the block and leave it out, i cover it with a bowl"
176076888,"Thanks! I guess i can live with that, it seems like an adequate description."
176076889,5 ! Did you ever felt you been overmedicated ? And not so fun to test different meds?
174361557,Probably the best outlook on these silly hallucinations … don’t give them credence - just focus on tasks at hand each day to do what you have to do to be how you got to be
174361558,Maybe you can take some medicine like seroquel or clozapine to help you fall asleep.
176076890,But the post just automatically popped up when I opened my phone? I wasn’t scrolling the posts making false connections
176076891,On antipsychotics? ADs can worsen psychosis but your Drs should know more.
174361554,"Aren’t you guys going bankrupt under socialism? Thank God you guys left the EU. Here in America, we’re going to end up like Venezuela. I’m a capitalist. I think research investments are risky. A lot are duds. People are giving up on schizophrenia. I dont mind if they make billions. Where did you hear taxpayers are funding them? They are private companies with share holders. Tax payers fund your public health insurance, meds, housing, etc. I’m very, very fortunate that I’m on new meds because of private insurance. My dad worked 50+ years full time. Im covered until he dies or im recovered. Hopefully by then, I’ll have more money or ill accept the generics. I dont believe in socialism and communism."
174361548,Therapy helps. It doesn’t fix the brain but teaches you to use your faulty brain in better ways to function in the world.
176076892,31 ib lost. I weigh 239.
176076893,"I got a job! Maybe… I didn’t even have to do an interview, I was just offered the job over the phone. (I hate interviews since going into psychosis so I was happy about that) Still waiting to hear back from hiring manager cause there were a few mistakes on my hiring/job offer email but I’m pretty sure I still got it! Hopefully."
176076894,What SSRI have you tried? I’m thinking about giving one a shot. I suppose Wellbutrin would be a good start.
176076895,I like it. You paint well.
176076896,‘Beauty’ and ‘real form’ in the same sentence. The Platonic plot thickens.
176076897,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_!
176076898,"I try to avoid hating people, and I think it would be therapeutic if you did too. Hate only eats away on yourself, so by hating someone else you are actually hurting yourself. If there are people you don’t like for whatever reason I would replace hate with ignoring them instead. Say to yourself that because you don’t respect them, they or their opinions do not matter. Don’t sacrifice them a thought. There are good people out in the world too, don’t stop believing that."
176076899,"I am on a 10mg dose but I also take Loxapine… when I was on Zyprexa I was on the max dose and it helped, but I still was super delusional. Also, happy birthday!"

176076901,"No, no physical sensations, just a pulling need to do something when I’m aware of what I’m doing (and trying to stop myself), or just doing it when I’m not aware."
176076902,"I’m no it was the opposite. I was like, this is GONNA WORK, THIS IS GONNA WORK. I feel really irritated today. BTW. Hope you’re well"
174361544,"NO CLUE HOW THEY KNOW WHAT I’M THINKING. I’m not gifted & wasn’t included on that info. I know stupid ass people around me do what I call MOUTHING & pretend they’re not doing it. 24/7 everywhere & anywhere I go. It pisses me off because they’re so stupid(people around me)& when I’m scared they don’t realize I mean I’m scared of me because I know how violent I’m capable of getting. Which is normal considering the reality they put me in. Only human. Unfortunately they think that, & want me to be scared of them. I’m terrified, terrified of me. They use triggering words only I would know. It’s been going on for the past 2yrs that I know of, maybe before that. I think it started in the home. I call my crappy family THE SHITTY COMMITTEE or just COMMITTEE. Any time I’ve asked they denied it was happening & sounded mentally challenged. I have a stalker who happens to be someone I had sex w/that joined the committee & also seems mentally challenged anytime I’ve asked him for the tr
uth. There’s more to that stalker (_NAME_) story but later maybe. He belongs to a messed up Facebook group (if anyone knows the group name I’d appreciate it)where it’s a safe place for stupid people to share ?????? up things they’ve done to their exes. Like spy, gang stalk, harass to the point they probably want to kill themselves or perhaps have. Sounds frightening to some but these are just a bunch of stupid people. They’re ugly, loud individuals keeping Vegas weak. Not sure if anyone’s heard of ‘Vegas Strong’. I’ve had breakdowns where I’ve cried & said outloud to stop buying the bs the committee & MTD we’re selling & believe the human that didn’t ‘earn it’, volunteered for it & was done against my will or knowledge, instead of the internet. Out loud almost screaming it. Oh yes, whenever I tattled the committee & mtd/face of the committee, whom I hold responsible btw, would hurt my left ear. Sometimes my left eye. Light sensitive btb. For some reason cars, not as much now, shine 
their brights at me while I’m driving. & yes some of the committee did try to convince me I was schizophrenic. I think they got angry & even more stupid when it didn’t work. My children & a _NAME_ & his family are doing something via social apps like Snapchat & I think spyware on my phone. They can stop it but they won’t. This past year I was told it was going to go on all yr long weather I liked or not & weren’t going to explain why. They didn’t stop like they said & it’s continueing this yr obviously. The committee tell me I need MTD & not to ignore me. Yes I do smoke & no I don’t believe they care like they pretend, since I smoke even more because of this reality they’ve created. I was actually trying to quit before all this. I have anxiety issues, depression (which is another story)& I am a bit crazy but not mental. & No none around me wants to let me in on their joke. They won’t give me the info to whatever app they’re using to share info about me to each other. All I know is that the
y’re ugly loud weak pieces of waste people around me that are being used. While the committee & the face of the committee are at home on their phones recieveing the info & passing on bs to say to me for them. The committee & MTD have my number but refuse to communicate directly to me for some reason & none of these weak people that won’t shut the up want to explain anything."
176076903,I hope you find the support and help you need to receive here!
176076904,we will see if my private pdoc succeeds
176076905,"The longest job I ever had was two whole years. That was when I was still in school. I was sick but didn’t realize it yet. I had been diagnosed with depression at that point, but I really needed lamotrigine for the mood swings. I felt aggressive. Anyhow, when I had a job, I consistently missed days. I am definitely not reliable. I would say I only showed up about 70% of the time."
176076906,"I claim to have proven it, but in any case, the apparent improvability of a proposition has not always turned to be so, and much can be learnt from such debates."
176076907,I’m way more likely to get dementia from my multiple concussions then I am from taking my meds.
176076908,Which one helped
176076909,Yeah I forgot completely the concept of sleeping like I didn’t know what happens during sleep like that your body gets restored completely forgot what sleep is for and what it is
176076910,"Hey, welcome aboard!"
176076911,"Is strong coffee helping? I used to sleep all day 14h everyday but now I drink 2 cups of strong coffee at 9-10AM, I sleep at 11PM."
176076912,Yeah hearing that. It’s a shame. I got on disability in 2004. You shouldn’t have to work with sz it’s burden enough. I’m totally unsure about what you can do but maybe have a look at the Sane website. I think they have a forum too. It’s Australian mental health advocacy group…I think they are still around.
176076913,The study doesn’t just indicate correlation. As a direct cause of ingesting caffeine the white noise interpretation was increased. Did anyone read the study? My psychiatrist won’t let me have full caffeine coffee.
176076914,"I still have the occasional voice- but only when I think in my head, so I’ve learned not to “think” about things too much? Also anytime I get a job I always think my coworkers are talking about me… which they might be or they might not be??? It’s hard to tell with this illness… What about you?"
176076915,"To be dirty, stinking, filthy rich."
176076916,I wish I could help out somehow. That sounds pretty depressing. I’m sorry to hear that.
176076917,The title of the film sounds interesting Reminds me of my early days with sza when I used to write all over my bedroom walls. It was chaos in my room! Can’t do it now I’m married and sharing a room lol!
176076918,Delusional is thinking everyone is out to get me. Non-delusional is ignoring everyone who is out to get me.
174361545,"Welcome to the forum. Maybe see a psychiatrist about these things. Ask your GP for a reference. If I had to guess I’d say “simple schizophrenia”, negatives without many positives. The walking around a lot part usually leads to a full meltdown, just saying."
176076919,oh ok gotcha. What were your td issues?
174361569,"They say that the later the onset, the better your prognosis, and I tend to agree with that. My onset was at the age of 20, which is considered “classical” for schizophrenia."
176076920,I had my phone telling me it’s not secure too yesterday. I had an update to chrome today and now it seems ok. Logging out and logging back in helped too. Maybe try that.
176076921,I have both. They’re are some similarities. I often hallucinate one of my abusers and I don’t know if it’s PTSD or sz.
176076922,"Stress brings on psychosis for me, I do better alone most of the time."
176076923,I dont know why i start crying after taking 1st dose of any SSRI except paxil. I stop my med after 1st dose itself. Pdoc said to not stop my ssri even if i start crying as it will go away with time. I dont cry if i take high dose benzo along with it though. But i sleep all day on benzo so i cant take it. To keep crying everyday would be a torture but to do that i think i would need to hospitalize myself. Any thoughts ?
176076924,I wouldn’t use the word afflicted. I would say they have different symptoms.
176076925,"Last October when I was getting a Real ID, I gave up my DL for a State ID card. You don’t have to be physically/mentally fit for one of those. I don’t own a car or drive anymore because I can’t afford it. My insurance was high along with repairs to my car."
176076926,What are your voices like now?
174361559,"I think black swan does an excellent job. the way we don’t know wats real and wats not real just like the person in the movie when all the people are gossiping about her and stuff. and the acculmulating stress on her to be something that is unrealistic unless she damages herself in the process,vvery relatable movie and the way she is so frightened. and the whole lust thing for the dance teacher and how her mother is, all seemingly aggravating her condition. I think it does a very good job of portraying psychosis except when she kills herself in the end by killing another version of her I cant really relate to how that works"
176076927,"If they put you on clozapine, you need to be strictly observed for the first thirty days at your age, just relax and try to start feeling better by putting your mind in a better place."
176076928,"I’m alone 99% of the time and have been for many years, some times I need to talk, but it passes. Not sure what keeps me going really"
174361552,"I don’t have any friends in real life, I have no one to call or hang out with. I have a few family members who don’t really understand schizophrenia. In the distant past I had a few friends that pissed me off but most did not."
176076929,"I rarely think about them, but they really hurt me. When I think about them I am ashamed. This is probably because, like many victims, I felt guilty. I’d like to be neutral about these thoughts. I think these people may have caused my current condition. However, I don’t really feel any hatred. I know that EMDR can help but I’m not ready to take the plunge. Actually, my therapist suits me well."
176076930,I’m trying to stop it from happening… sometimes I get angry though and rage
176076931,yeah she knows all my symptom profile. I do have risperidone as a prn if i need it. and i have lamictal.
174361550,What don’t you like about the Abilify?
176076932,"sometimes I eat meat. I was vegan for 4 years and didn’t touch meat or dairy, then I went back to meat for a couple years, now im vegetarian where I eat like 3 servings cheese a day. sometimes my mom will make me dinner with meat and i’ll occasionally eat meat then. also at holiday BBQ’s and thanksgiving I will eat meat. im mostly vegetarian. I find it’s better not to stand out and make my diet an issue during social occasions, so I don’t say much about being a vegetarian. i’ll let the young people do the fighting over ethics."
174361560,Wow that’s got to be one of the nicest remarks I’ve received in like forever!
176076933,"It’s better than it should be given that I’m very obese, which isn’t saying much. Cholesterol - ok,blood pressure- ok, liver functioning -ok, kidney functioning -excellent, water retention in ankles and legs due to sedentary lifestyle, low folic acid level, lower back aches if I walk any distance(probably weight related)."
176076934,"I’m honest, but I have trouble bringing up certain things. Just because they’ve been such a persistent thorn in my side that I take them for granted that they’ll always be a problem."
176076935,Best of luck with it. I hope it suits you.
176076936,"In coping w/my symptoms + diagnosis, I’ve found that youtube channels such as _NAME_, Dr. _PERSON_, and Polar Warriors, are helpful. Tbh, I mostly watch Dr. _PERSON_ videos. Though I have subscribed to those three. There are others, but I can’t remember them I also use an app called Woebot which does cognitive behavioral therapy."
176076937,"I speak Romanian (my mother tongue) as well as decent French and English. However, all of my (rare) verbal dreams are in Romanian. In the past I did have some foreign language dialogues, but not recently. I don’t remember when and why that happened, probably as a result of intense usage of said language the day(s) before the dream occurred."
176076938,Why don’t you take meds?
176076939,"I’ve seen veterans who are filled with so much PTSD they become psychotic. It’s a sad thing to see, quite honestly."
176076940,"To be able to see the good things without the ability to enjoy or truly appreciate them serves only to remind us of the joy and happiness that we can only aspire to but never have. It is the unattainable, just out of grasp never achievable happiness that remind us of our position. To not know why we suffer is an additional concept to prove of our damnation for if we knew why we suffered it would be quantified and made easier to endure. If you look at nature through the lower animals eyes then the cold, oppressive predatory nature of it would come to full view. Fear and hunger pervades in nature and it is only through human form can we skew the reality of it to beauty when to them it is far from it. Good food is a principle where in order to sustain life in this hell one must predate on other animals. Even if you were vegan you cannot avoid cruelty for the maintenance of crops kills trillions of insects and the food chain around it. Food and the need for it proves if anything the true nature of this 
plane of existence and it is predatory. I am yet to meet a ‘good’ person in real life, but that is personable to me alone. Possibly there are good ones out there, but few and far between. I am not saying that in hell a few little blessings cannot happen, for to know evil then the good must exist to realise it. I am also not saying that heaven doesn’t exist here on earth, but those that share this plane of existence can be hell while others can be in heaven. It is not mutually exclusive. Sorry, i didn’t mean to bring you down."

176076942,"I do it a lot with my panic attacks, it’s usually just cause I swallow a lot of saliva when I feel one coming on, then panic worse cause I know I’m gonna have. But once I get it out, take my additional xanax, and a soft chew tums, I’m good. Are you also on any of the AP that cause weird saliva production like some of the he first generations? If I remember right flufenazene did it to me the worst. Like I had never drooled in my sleep before, and I had to wash my pillowcase and sometimes pillow every freaking day. Did that for 2 months, a combination of not even working on me and other side effects stopped me on it, but the drool was like being a St _NAME_, lol"
176076943,Leaf - not to be paranoid i need to say i have not read a word here that has not happened to me in the last 3 months i saw a psychiatrist now it’s a 6 months wait the support i’m entitled to isn’t there
176076944,‘just’ have to control my thoughts. _PERSON_ like it’s easy…
174361556,"The couple of years ago, I talked to my pdoc, and he upped the dosage of my AP. I was hallucinating last summer, but don’t know if I heard voices. I had switched to 5mg Abilify. My pdoc upped it to 10mg, and the hallucinations mostly went away. It sometimes sounds like someone is outside my front door, but when I check, nobody is there. Yesterday I heard a voice in my apartment building hallway, but nobody was there. I haven’t heard it since."
174361561,"Gratitude, it is terrible to be ostracized. That’s what the label does. I don’t like it when people say, “She’s a schizophrenic” or “He’s bipolar.” People are diagnosed, and it’s up to them to accept that or not. But people aren’t labeled as, “She’s a cancer,” or “He’s heart disease.”"
174361570,"I get the point. But it does not follow. Take pernicious anemia, which is caused by B12 deficiency and which can cause psychosis as a primary presentation. This is well known to western medical science. It causes anemia but it does not follow that populations with anemia are more prone to getting schizopnrenia. Neither does it follow that populations with anemia are more prone to getting pernicious anemia. Another way of thinking - let’s say I am correct in my hypothesis, which is not proven and by no means certain. Say 1% of the population get schizophrenia and then say (and this is not the actual figure) 5% of that schizopnrenic subgroup have anemia, and then say 25% of those are responsive to EGLN inhibitors. The effect is very small. It would not be observable looking at the anemic population as a whole. But being able to try EGLN inhibitors with a 25% prospect of success would be significant in a schizophrenic subgroup."
176076945,"Yeah, I’m aware of that. I just wanted to see if any supplementers on here know a good site."
176076946,"I think I’m a pretty adept driver. When I lived in NYC I was nervous about driving, but then I discovered that I’m fairly good at it. You have to lean into it and become one with the flow. _AT_MENTION_ I can often tell which threads are yours before I click on them. I find myself doing that more and more with a lot of posters on the forum. I kind of like it, but it probably means I spend too much time here."

176076949,It’s like a river that is stuck where it’s going but can’t stop.
176076950,My mother told my psychiatrist that I was aggressive and what I did/destroyed like attacking my brother and punching walls/doors while psychotic. I feel ashamed. I feel like I have traumatic memories of my psychosis.
176076951,"yes, i was working today and i’m trying to build my hours up so its a tep and they are taking it slow with me (its basically a type of back to work rehab) and i may have another one lined up in January as a cafe barista, it has been taking me a long time to build up mental resilience, i have tried working in the past but things didnt work out,"

It’s too much… I can’t remember what I did but when I came back down the stairs, she asked if I had gone to the bathroom. I couldn’t remember. I didn’t no many words then but I knew about lying. So, I said “yes”. True, I had been to the bathroom but I don’t know what I did there. The memory makes me very angry at her.

Antidepressants may not help much with these symptoms. Beyond medications, problem-solving treatment can train people how to improve their problem-solving skills, and cognitive behavioral therapy can teach people to recognize and challenge distorted thinking patterns. Another approach, cognitive remediation therapy, uses practice drills to improve memory and executive functioning. Combining these behavioral interventions with antidepressants may yield better results for improving depression-related cognitive impairments."

M _PERSON_, Z _PERSON_, A ?ncedere, A Kircali, F Kiras and K ?pçi, _PERSON_ psikiyatri arsivi , Jun 2019 The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Psychosocial Skills Training (PSST) and Metacognitive Training (MCT) programs on general psychopathology, cognitive functioning, and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia.Twenty patients with schizophrenia who were treated at the Kocaeli University Psychiatry Department outpatient clinic between January and June 2016, accepted to participate in the study and met inclusion criteria were included in this study. Patients were randomized as two groups of 10 people. The management of each group was carried out by a trainer and a co-trainer. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S) to assess psychopathology, the General Assessment of Fu
nctioning (GAF) and the Quality of Life Scale in Schizophrenia (QoLS) to assess social functioning, the Cognitive Assessment Interview (CAI) to assess cognitive functioning were used by the clinicians blinding to groups in the first two weeks before and after the intervention. After the training, first and last test scale scores were compared.All patients who participated in the study completed the study (male: 13, female: 7). There was no significant difference in age, gender, marital status, years of education, duration of illness, the age of onset, and the number of hospitalizations in comparison of individual and clinical characteristics of the groups (p>0.05). When the scores were compared of the groups before and after the intervention, there was a significant difference concerning psychopathology, social and cognitive functioning in both groups (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of effect size.The study showed that both programs aiming to improve psychopathology 
and functioning in the treatment of schizophrenia have positive results. Improvement in cognitive functioning should also be tested by neurocognitive tests in the large-scale studies with control groups."

176077078,Hi. I didn’t know who to turn to so I hope this helps. I quit all my meds about 3 to 4 weeks ago. I felt good then it got bad. I have been physical with nurses-I spat in a nurses face when they restrained me. This is not like me at all. The police men in my head won’t shut up. They tell me they are going to gang rape me etc and I can physically feel it. They said they would take more of my body parts and they have-my feet. I am in hospital at the moment and it looks like I am going to be discharged this week. The doctor doesn’t know this stuff. He says he isn’t going to force me on meds. I’m pretty good at hiding it but water is starting to slip through the cracks. Do I tell him and risk being injected and made to stay in hospital? Or should I just persevere through it. Please help me im at wits end.

176077090,Good stuff! Hope you will be happy there when you get it. When I lived in Sweden I rented a apartment through the government. It’s called second hand contract. When the Swedish government saw that I always paid my bills they thought I was trustworthy so they gave me a first hand rental contact which means a lot. There was several apartment blocks built in my then neighbourhood for the mentally disabled. They got their own apartment but on the bottom floor was a joint kitchen and living room for everyone to socialise in and meet staff. They had staff 24/7. Not in the individual apartment but in the joint areas. There was a mentally disabled family with a baby and they got help by staff to care for it. My friend in Sweden lives in a apartment for mentally disabled. They are supposed to have dinner together but he chooses to eat alone as he feels uncomfortable around them. They have staff 24/7 to and he has staff give him medication every night. He wants to have his own place in the country side in t
he future. If I was in Sweden I would be dependent on the government for living and would have to rent one of their places. Because I’m in Australia I have family here that help me thankfully. My former stepmother lets me rent her apartment at a cheap cost. My rent is less than half the normal cost. Some people who work very hard can’t afford to live in this area so I’m very well taken care of. My favourite home was sacred scull home with x boyfriend and his dogs. Nothing compares to that home. It was pretty perfect. I had to leave to become vegan. Miss him n girls n home. Before I got my apartment in Sweden I was living in a group home for mentally ill. You had a room but the kitchen and bathroom was shared and staff 24/7. I didn’t like having noisy neighbors. Very disturbing.
176077091,If you are talking like this on meds I can’t even imagine what you would be like off meds. You need better meds. Clearly something’s not working. I’m seriously worried about you friend.

And even still, I’ve never had a depressive episode that wasn’t the direct result of a positive symptom. _USER_ID_: Granted, I did have the “loss of interest in activities that used to be enjoyable” symptom, but all of the activities that I dropped were physical.

176077115,10 mgs of Zyprexa/Olanzapine 3 mgs of Ativan. I’ve been on Zyprexa since 1997. When I got out of the hospital in 1997 they had me drugged to the max with all kinds of stuff. I couldn’t function so I quit taking all the drugs. My mom found me a new doctor and he put me on 10 Zyprexa. Some of the hallucinations and delusions came back but I toughed it out and fought through it. Slowly over 5 years the hallucinations subsided. Back then I decided that if I have to take medication the rest of my life I didn’t want to be on a cocktail of meds. I wanted to be on as little meds as possible because of long term effects. I learned I needed meds and I knew not to quit taking them because I had one relapse and I didn’t want to have another.

My dr said there is no meds yet but I believe its permanent brain damage and nothing can be done.

174361638,"That sounds like apathy. It’s a negative symptom of schizophrenia, and one of the most common symptoms of depression and Parkinson’s disease. In a way, it may look like a personality trait, but it’s really a matter of one’s level of motivation. Ie. anyone afflicted with apathy suffers from reduced motivation and will seem “lazy” in comparison with their normal personality. The difference is that you can choose whether to be lazy or not, but you don’t have a say in whether to have apathy. For me, it is the worst symptom, whether it is regarded as a negative symptom or as depression (I favour the latter classification). -_NAME_."

At first it feels like that–because ur fighting a battle against non-stop mania/paranoia/delusions, and those can connect to how we feel. Your emotions can come back, but it takes therapy and working on finding peace/happiness in small things step by step it can actually improves your empathy and emotions. I have been on just about all the anti-psychotics Abilify works for me. Right now I am on 10mgs a day. Found that a lower dose is way better/because once you reach a stable maintain a schedule is more pro-active and helpful than if u try to just numb yourself with pills. Hope this makes sense. Once I was able to ground myself in reality I saw major improvements in everything."

176077248,"well done _AT_MENTION_. I’ve made a discovery of Moderation Management. It’s basically that you manage your habit to healthy levels but don’t abstain entirely. I think this suits me best as I’m not a 12 stepper and can drink in moderation - I caught up with my gig buddies in the new year (drinkers) at a fav pub (drinking environment) and I just drank moderately - 2 beers over 6 hours. I was under 0.05 & able to drive home at the end. I got no buzz from my beers, it was just fizzy/sour/bitter stuff that I could talk about with friends re flavour…the whole concept of drinking for the taste, not the buzz. I don’t want to disrespect or undermine all that you have going here on this thread. Abstinence is awesome & admirable. Best for your health & liver. However, I think moderation may be a realistic way forward for me as an individual, the MM program is harm reduction which I know from my social work days. It is a 9 step program (and I’m not really a stepper) so I’ll see how I go. I lik

176077277,"I want to take lithium. At least for a month or two, it can be neurotrophic, reversing the loss of grey and white matter volume which follows mood episodes. CURRENT ISSUES: —mixed manic state — 9 months anxiety, panic, derealization, sensory hypersensitivity, obsessions, aggression —protracted benzo withdrawal — 3 months anterograde amnesia — from both above — 9 months Amnesia is improving on Trileptal and Lamictal. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Clinical and preclinical evidence for the neurotrophic effects of mood stabilizers: implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of manic-depressive illness. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Biological psychiatry , Oct 2000 15 Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated regional central nervous system volume reductions in mood disorders, findings that are complemented by postmortem observations of cell atrophy and loss. It is thus noteworthy that lithium and valproate have recently been demonstrated to robustly increase the expression of the cytoprot
ective protein bcl-2 in the central nervous system. Chronic lithium not only exerts neuroprotective effects in several preclinical paradigms but also enhances hippocampal neurogenesis. Valproate robustly promotes neurite outgrowth and activates the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, a signaling pathway utilized by many endogenous neurotrophic factors. Consistent with its preclinical neurotrophic/neuroprotective effects, chronic lithium treatment of patients with manic-depressive illness increases brain N-acetylaspartate (a putative marker of neuronal viability and function) levels, an effect that is localized almost exclusively to gray matter. To determine if lithium was producing neuropil increases, quantitative three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging studies were undertaken, which revealed that chronic lithium significantly increases total gray matter volume in the human brain of patients with manic-depressive illness. Together, these results suggest that a reconceptualization about the opti
mal long-term treatment of recurrent mood disorders is warranted. Optimal long-term treatment for these severe illnesses may only be achieved by the early use of agents with neurotrophic/neuroprotective effects, irrespective of the primary, symptomatic treatment. PubMed Central (PMC) The role of lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder: convergent evidence... Lithium has been and continues to be the mainstay of bipolar disorder (BD) pharmacotherapy for acute mood episodes, switch prevention, prophylactic treatment, and suicide prevention. Lithium is also the definitive proof-of-concept agent in BD,... Lithium seems like “brain food”, but atypical antipsychotics, valproate and SSRIs also help."

Maybe pick something else to do all on your own and be successful at. I was so grateful to have a very mellow, laid back, friendly cat. I didn’t look at the whole experience as successful as a whole but I had a few victories along the way that made me feel good. Good luck with your dog."

176077282,I’m sorry for your loss.
176077283,I took Korean ginseng to boost immune system and energy.
174361668,Very very close. Just a little chattering but nothing distinct. Clozapine helped me
176077284,They ask when you fill out the application. Not in the interview.
176077285,Glad about your progress and happy your outlook is more positive! Getting the meds right really can make a difference and the earlier you invest in your health the better. I wish I thought about it more when I was 30. I’m fitter now than I was then at 49 but I wasted a lot of years with low motivation and just getting through!
176077286,A lot of people have killed another human it’s common. People you work with or your neighbors. Ex gang members and military types maybe people who have killed someone accidentally in a car accident or self defense maybe you live near a cop or FBI agent who has killed
176077287,"Yeah, you should be converting some of that weight to muscle (I know converting isn’t the correct terminology but for simplicities sake, it is conversion). Are you sure it’s not hiding beneath whatever mass you do have? Often that’s the case. If you’re a smoker this is quite common (least I read that somewhere )"
176077288,For me one reason is cos I can’t do exercise anymore. Just walking. Exercise helps to regulate my appetite I also think it’s a comfort eating thing
176077289,I get into hobbies. I was into model railroading for a while but way too expensive for my taste so these days into scale modelling. There’s plenty of stuff out there for other things like needlework and other things…it’s just something to help pass the time where you feel like you’ve accomplished things. It’s all up to you… I’m with you on the entertainment. I really struggle with most things but reality tv. Most things I don’t watch like movies but I’m trying. I read every night if I can. Make a start and move from there…Find something that is productive and fill in your time! Even exercise is great!
176077290,So the television is talking about me?
174361673,"It seems very often I get strange unpleasant feelings when they say something, and sometimes it makes it seem like the voices want me to feel those unpleasant feelings by saying those things. By "" ‘strange’ unpleasant feelings"" I mean that the feelings are not an emotional response, but feelings that I never experienced before schizophrenia."

176077313,But how do you get a grip? I’m finding it frustrating I can’t stop it.
176077314,"For what it’s worth, pot made me sick too. That’s how I got schizophrenia. I don’t do that stuff anymore. Been years."
176077315,"Becoming healthier is scary to a lot of people, strange as that is. The voices don’t control you, they don’t have that power. You lost all the weight once, you can do it again. The voices tricked you last time. They don’t want you to be healthy or happy, you have to fight them. Medication has helped me. As well as trying to think a positive thought for everything bad the voices say."

176077317,"It’s not unusual to get some bouts of paranoia from time to time. Just got to turn on that logical side of the brain and start debating if the thoughts are reasonable and almost all of the time they aren’t. I find that sometimes what we eat can trigger a emotional response. For instance I discovered that whenever I took _PERSON_ Root I would get superparanoid. I don’t know why, but it’s interesting that sometimes what we ingest can influence us very much."

176077319,Thank you all for the suport. I will not hurt myself again.
176077320,"I have had rough times reconciling my previous spiritual beliefs when I was coming to terms with being schizoaffective. I think it’s safe to say that we’re entitled to the same level of beliefs we had before we got sick, it’s just that they often function as a trigger for unhealthy, delusional thinking, so you find yourself staying away from them and they are unable to provide you the comfort they once did. I’m hoping if I stay delusion free for a couple more years I can think about my spirituality again. I totally get where you’re coming from. I like to believe there’s a place I’ll see one day without being sick, and believing that actually makes me not want to die… if I had proof of the afterlife, I’d be sooooo okay with being schizoaffective. I don’t know what advice to give you, other than if you have a recovery trajectory and you’re making good progress, you might want to shelf these areas of discussion for maybe six months to a year from now. That’s kind of what I’ve 
been doing."
176077321,You will never get me inside a mental hospital again for as long as I live.
176077322,"I was being really healthy with eating and all, but i had a lesser day. Oh well. Something not quite about healthy diet, but i noticed i like showering again! I used to hate the shower and now im really enjoying a daily hot shower. It might have something to do with feeling happier and healthier in my body after changing my diet to just normal good food."
176077323,"Its cool that you can read books, I can’t read books or long texts or even long posts here anymore since having sz 10 years ago at age 20-21."
176077324,In Islam if you fart you have to perform Wudu(a cleansing ritual purification) before you are allowed to perform your next prayer. I was Muslim for like a year or more while I was psychotic.

No one will want a partner who cant even think or even talk cause cant thinking… I fight, but being shut down for lots of the info around since kid is hard… I am not sure I can recover on this… Meds doesn’t give an intellect, so there’s no point to take more… Maybe theres still the option to live even a bit less smart, but my senses are just shut down for too much info… Why I cant think or get some info still? What kind of symptom is this?"

176077345,"Basically my support staff forgot to remind me and I had a couple of holidays, I’m 4 weeks lates having my depot injection and feel fine with no illness? Is this unusual? My nurse said its because I’ve had the 2 holidays to focus on and that I was well in the month with no negatives and it’s best not to miss the injection tomorrow… Do you think me maintaining wellness for a month means I’m actually okay and don’t need the injection?"
176077346,Me too I heard it not cause sedation so it is good Waiting more years for it to be available

176077361,I feel like maybe if I moved away I could change my life. I’m choosing to stay with my family so I’m not taking that opportunity to free myself possibly.

And spirits’ dimension (s) is a more comprehensive version of reality, like super _NAME_ and the kids playing it, you know. And since you are actually not an independent experiencer but a part of the biggest experiencer, and the biggest experiencer is not sure himself if he is real… the world is a dream. By examining the dream, we can get to know the dreamer. Dreaming, imagining yourself in different scenarios let’s us better know ourselves. Maybe reality is the big guy getting to know himself.

176077371,"I thought of an answer to your question and I will try to report the salient points of what happened to me last night between 9 and 10, yesterday afternoon I started to feel bad and I needed to understand what was happening to me, I don’t know how I took courage and I registered here and I prepared a message on a sheet of paper, shortly after it was as if that message had not been written by me and I did not publish it, I tried to write another one but I started staying badly, then the thoughts began to flow and I could not stop them to write them and soon after I forgot them. at this point I felt inside me an entity that was repressing them by straining and creating a headache. interrupted, as if they melted. I have been writing that message which is nothing more than a sentence repeated three times, trying not to feel bad. this morning I feel better because my thought corresponds to the fact that now I am to writing, even if the migraine does not leave me, but I do not feel that entity ."

176077374,"I wouldn’t say ‘severe’ it’s just the over-arching thought of not wanting to be different, or think you’re not like everyone else or living with a label. With my daughter’s CF, we lived in healthy denial, I wanted her to be able to do anything, have a relatively normal childhood."

It seems to have a different mechanism of antipsychotics action, which affects the dopaminergic system, but differently from modern antipsychotics. They used the reserpine in it as an antipsychotic in the 50’s. I think they still use reserpine as an add-on in some countries for treatment resistant cases. en.m.wikipedia.org Reserpine Reserpine is a drug that is used for the treatment of high blood pressure, usually in combination with a thiazide diuretic or vasodilator. Large clinical trials have shown that combined treatment with reserpine plus a thiazide diuretic reduces mortality of people with hypertension. Although the use of reserpine as a solo drug has declined since it was first approved by the FDA in 1955, a review recommends use of reserpine and a thiazide diuretic or vasodilator in patients who do not achi

Doses for this kind of adjunctive goal can be kept low,”"

I kindof agree but I still think he should get treatment for life and be monitored and not free n out in society normally. He still murdered though even if he believed it was self defence. I had a moment where I … I have been incredibly delusional in the past . I have had so many delinks delusional but I’m stable now and am not delusional now thankfully so one can get better. I truly believed all my delusions. This man believes his delusions still. How should a mentally ill person be punished? Forsed care? Special jail for mentally ill? Foot lock n monitored?(hello paranoia claustrophobic…)

176077415,When I was Catholic I heard a voice that said I was a saint. I believed I had to write this book about the crucifixion and _NAME_ and that it was a special mission entrusted to me. In my teens my Pentecostal mom said I would be a prophet of the church when I grew up. I remember all I wanted was to be normal but when I was Catholic I aimed for the sainthood. I used to practise excessive penances to suffer with Christ. Like I’d put a crown of thorns on my head and drink vinegar and lash my back every Friday. This was in my remission phase but looking back in think it was symptoms of my sza.

176077420,"Amisulpride 800mg per day has kept me sane for 2 years. I am pretty much recovered now. my main problem is the underlying anxiety that was being masked by the psychosis. They also now say I am autistic, which I am not so sure about as it’s still a bit new. That’s what happens I guess when you see a therapist… Also another supposedly good thing to do to ‘get better’. Have you tried poly pharmacy? Stop smoking weed. That is a must if you want to get better. I used to be into all that, but I have been clean for 10 years now and I am much better for it. Not sure if it applies to you, but re evaluate your current friends as if you’re doing drugs like weed it can attract horrible people."
176077421,You might have better luck checking on a bipolar forum for side effects if this drug. I think it’s really new and really expensive so there are probably few people on it.

176077428,Agree. I have one sza friend and I enjoy his company. Most of the time I spend alone is my best times currently though. People with huge egos are no fun…I only allow myself around humble people anymore.
176077429,"That happened to me too (and is still happening) after my ASD diagnosis as an adult. It’s actually been a process where I make the social mistakes but now I’m actually learning from them—modifying some of my behaviors so as not to alienate myself, while cutting myself some slack because I have a better understanding of myself. I hope you’re able to meet with another therapist regularly at some point. I will say that some of the books I’ve found on Aspergers (as well as podcasts) have been very helpful too. I think your letter is well written."
176077430,Abilify didnt do much for my positive symptoms…then my pdoc switched me on clozapine which worked great for positive symptoms for 7 years but then i developed alot of side effects on clozapine…now we are tapering clozapine and increasing amisulpride instead.

It’s absolute torture to want to die all the time and to be contemplating suicide. I wish you the best."
176077446,_PERSON_ I know everyone reacts differently to meds. My psychiatrist told me that just some patients develop negative symptoms from meds. He talked about the discovery of antipsychotics and how some patients were not functional in society even with meds.

176077453,"Not that I’m aware of. I don’t really think now everyone is out to get me after my pdoc upped the dose of my Abilify to 15mg. I switched to Abilify a year ago, and he started me out on 5mg, maybe to see if I still needed to be on an antipsychotic. I really don’t know why he put me on 5mg, but I was having my old symptoms on the dose being that low. I was on 20mg of Zyprexa when I got out of the psychiatric hospital the Fall of 2008."

Silence sounds like silence, unless I try really hard to make out words. A few more days and my headache will be effectively zero. It’s low enough now that I don’t feel like I should complain anymore, but it’s still kind of blocking my positive emotions. It’s not an ache anymore, but a persistent inflamed pressure in the back-middle of my brain."

176077466,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you’ve not been doing well. I think that the stress of being a full-time caregiver over an extended time period without a break is really detrimental to your health and wellbeing. This is independent of whether you might also benefit from a med adjustment. I suspect that a med adjustment by itself, without addressing the source of ongoing stress, is unlikely to provide long-term relief. Can you discuss this with your pdoc and maybe ask your pdoc to help advocate for you regarding stopping the caregiver role? Your husband may be more receptive if an impartial third party, such as your pdoc, weighs in."

We block all of them except ones we think would actually benefit the psychosis community. As for professionals, we don’t see many of those. Occasionally, someone will message us with a professional study they’re looking to recruit for. If we approve the study, it shows up, if we don’t, their account is deleted. But I’ve never seen a professional use this as a resource for anything more than study recruitment. They spend all day with crazy people. They don’t want to work more when they come home.

176077506,"So another update in my very hectic life is i made plans to see muslim judicial council but only in January the lady said is appt to start divorce proceedings. They’re fully booked till then. In meantime what I decided to do is to collect some more stuff from my house on Sunday - my most important possessions like laptop and personal documents and art things, my favourite books, and a few more clothes etc. Then the pdoc at hospital finally gave me a call and spoke about my husband - he actually does have sz as well as the epilepsy! It’s crazy - two of us schizo! A recipe for disaster as it has turned out! Not only that but he’s doing well and being discharged today. TODAY???!!! this really shocked me because I didn’t want to see him yet till after I collect my stuff. Everything is happening so fast! He will have to stay with his parents but sometimes in past he asked them to drop him at our place so he can relax there alone. But now I have no way to know if he will be there when I collect m
y stuff on Sunday. And I need to scratch in his drawer for marriage certificate and don’t want him to know. My mom advised me to not tell him of my decision to divorce yet, but only say I want separation for a few weeks. So how will it look to him for me to take marriage certificate - or a copy - with me? Oh God, I wish he wasn’t coming home quite just yet! I know it seems selfish of me to think that but in the situation I’m in its not easy… And he is most likely going to phone soon. What am I going to say to him?? My mom just said I must say I’m taking a break at my sister and that I want a little time apart. But what if his parents tell him what I told his sister - about possibly leaving him? God I. Was. So. Stupid.!!! What on earth to do now???"

174361714,I had to find help on my own. No one in my family even knew. My husband and kids suspected because I was saying strange things but I went on a lot of long walks in which I pretend to be talking on my phone so people don’t know I’m really talking to my voices. This gave me time to “be myself” with my voices and still hide it from the people I love. I didn’t want anyone to know. Not a single schizophrenic who hears voices or has any other delusional types of thoughts wants to be like that or at least we wouldn’t. Talk to your sister and ask her if there is anything positive about her delusions that is preventing her from getting help. Most likely there is something that feels magical about it and she is afraid that medication will take away something good. That’s what happened to me anyway. I hear “good” voices most of the time but in 2016 I had a full psychotic break and blacked out. That’s when I sought treatment

Could eazy live with just food/ciggaretes/coffee and internet and be content. With that. No perspective, no real purpose, no desire to do anything Need money for ciggaretes and coffee, need internet for entertainment and that basically it. So Whta am I doing with my life? I feel like I’m going nowhere, I don t wanna disappoint my mother and sister sohats why I keep going. But it’s all to much, stress everywhere, I don’t find peace in mostly anything. I should die and be free."
176077527,"I had a best friend. After I was diagnosed and told him, I knew he hated me for it. I decided that I should not call him and let him come to me. That was 6 years ago now, and I have not seen him since. I know he hates me now."

176077529,Sorry to hear that _AT_MENTION_ one day at a time you know. _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ yeah… I mean I consider friendship is prerequisite to stable love. It’s just chaos with out proper correlation. Lol I’m sort of a nerd though… I have good humor and pillow talk to me… but I really doubt I share a strong set of common interests. We share the same favorite bars though… The sense of aesthetic and culture… sort of maturity and class winning out… that’s starting to hit that zone of reading to much into things.
176077530,I don’t know I had crazier experiences with lsd than magic shrooms. Other than this one but this one just messed up my life rather than seeing crazy things or losing my ego. I remember during this trip saying to my self “I’m gonna ask my religion class teacher if he believes in god or not…I’m gonna ask him!!!” Then come the next day I didn’t want to. Seriously mixing meds with psychedelics or a psychotic illness in general is the worst thing we can do. I think lsd triggered my illness. When I was coming down my friend called me up on the phone and said “your ego!!” And I said “I know!!” This just drove me NUTS for years. You need your ego. I loved/respected these drugs but also afraid of them at this point

I didn’t see him until 10:30 or 10:45. I have arthritis and it hurts to sit so long. Also I no longer have a car so I had to walk from home.

I became a little depressed when I didnt see a huge change even though I’d been working all day. Getting tired, I made my big mistake- energy capsules. Not 1, but 2. Double the serving. I thought I could handle it. Heck, I drink coffee and Monsters and feel nothing most of the time. Within an hour I was overcome with severe anxiety and depression at the same time. Shaky. Feeling fragile. Ready to cry and breathing rapidly. Beating myself up, feeling worthless and just like I did before my last breakdown. Horrible intrusive thoughts. Trying to find anyone to talk to right away. Then I remembered the crisis info we share here and texted the crisis line. Guys, steer clear of energy pills and high levels of caffeine. Even if you drink energy drinks like crazy, and I do, trying to get an extra boost just is not worth going 
through a crisis. And if you DO find yourself in such a predicament, post here and you can tag me specifically. I’ll post our crisis post as long as I am online and if you need, I’ll try to help you through it. Be safe, all."

176077574,"I used to have auditory hallucinations that would try to convince me that they were psychics trying to contact me and convince me of various things. I actually believed them at first. Eventually, I realized that they can’t actually do anything to affect the real world. I started challenging them to do simple things like sending me a text message or email instead of contacting me psychically. At first, they were offended, but eventually they realized that they were just hallucinations. They were sad about it. They thought they were real. That broke me out of the delusion of believing that I have psychic powers. So, for me it was about thinking my way out of the trap of believing the delusion.

And all of a sudden I felt like the Lord, and these children were my flock. I whistled loudly and my twin daughters walked out of the pack towards me, safely into my arms and whisked them home in my car…calling the school to let them know I had taken them.

Tho i do pray that theyll mess with the wrong people at some point and get sent to prison because their paranoia gets the better of them. I mean theyre doing something illegal every day for hours at a time. All hypothetical of course, since being able to tell if its real or not wouldnt help me. Though i choose to believe i
ts in my imagination. This will pass eventually."

176077640,Quitting caffeine did the opposite for me. Took me a while to get my edge back. I’m down to a latte or macchiato most days. Sometimes I’ll have two. Can’t have more because of irregular heartbeat. I switched out to caffeine free teas and I’l drink six or more cups per day.
176077641,lol yea its okay.
176077642,"It’s taught me to splurge a little every now and then and be good to myself. For instance, I’m moving up in the world and have got myself a bigger, fancier apartment. For another, Ive finally thrown out my old, two ton, tube TV, and I’m going to buy my first flat screen, HD TV. I’ve also subscribed to Netflix, YouTube Plus, and a meditation app. Another thing is I’m conversing every Saturday afternoon for an hour with my own Spanish tutor. I’m so excited about all these changes. And these are the only new things I’m adding to my life . I’m done."

176077646,What’s going on? Anything you want to talk about?
176077647,From what I understand it has no clinical value and can react with different medications. I’d be prone to stick with the meds your doctor prescribes rather than a supplement.

174361749,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov From Onset and Prodromal Stage to a Life-Long Course of Schizophrenia and Its Symptom Dimensions: How Sex, Age, and Other Risk Factors Influence Incidence and Course of Illness. _PERSON_, Psychiatry journal , 2019 The core symptoms of psychosis-delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorders-are not unique to the disorder traditionally called schizophrenia. They occur at the early stages of various brain diseases, too. Psychosis seems to be a preformed pattern of response of the human brain. Most schizophrenia onsets are marked by a prodromal stage extending over several years and producing the maximum of social consequences. Schizophrenia incidence shows a steep increase culminating at age 15 to 25 years in males. In females it reaches a first peak at age 15 to 30 years and a second, flatter peak at menopausal age (44-49 years). Thereafter, incidence declines to a plateau at later ages. Unlike what the findings of most large-scale epidemiological studies applying an upper age lim
it of 45 to 55 years suggest, schizophrenia is a disorder of all ages. The lifetime risk seems to be the same for both sexes. The lower incidence in premenopausal women is accounted for by the downregulating effect of oestrogen on dopamine receptors. This hormonal protective effect is antagonised by the genetic effect of a high familial load. In the long-term illness course, right-censored to 11.2 years following first admission, the number of psychotic relapse episodes ranges from 0 to 29 with a mean of 3. The positive symptom dimension produces the highest number of relapses and the shortest duration of exacerbations with a mean length of two months. The depressive and negative symptom dimensions show exacerbations extending over nearly six months on average. Following the first illness episode symptom scores decline sharply, reaching a plateau five years after first admission. Negative symptoms come to a plateau after 2 to 3 years in females and after 5 years in males. Depression is the most frequent type 
of symptom in the long-term course. In the light of these results urgent treatment issues will be discussed."
174361750,"Yes they help. I take 200mg mg clozapine, 300mg Chlorpromazine, and 250mg haldol shot every month . Not so high doses. Occasionally I still have positive symptoms, that give me energy and save me from the abyss of negatives"
176077674,"I have the worst humour. Part dad jokes, part really offensive stuff, and part just plain dumb things, haha"
176077675,"Yes, in the fact that they are both opiates but morphine isn’t as strong as heroin. I actually love morphine. I’m in the hospital a lot for my endometriosis and I’ve had several surgeries. They generally give you dilaudid in your IV for pain where I’m from and it’s stronger then morphine, but dilaudid makes me itch and I’ll scratch myself until I bleed. They all have the itching as a potential side effect. I’ve never tweaked on morphine, but definitely high as a kite!"
176077676,Never been on Prollixin but I was switched to Haldol after Invega _PERSON_. I did not have a good experience with it. It did really help with my positive symptoms so I can say that about it. I was on 10mg. But it made me feel like a Zombie. I couldn’t function normally on it. I know other people do well on it though.
176077677,"I was on a Catholic forum and I discovered a post that questioned why God would place mentally ill and developmentally disabled people in this world if they will never know God.

It baffles me that people still think we’re dangerous and we’re unworthy to live. For the love of God. Will they ever be happy until that they get rid of me?"

174361757,"At my first psychotic episode i was only delusional, I was thinking my friends was demons and i was beliving i was Jesus and sometimes even god, And i felt like the devil was after me. And then i watch the news i felt like they send me messages only to me. The secund episode was like the first one. It was only third episode i began to hear voices all the time, and i dont really suffer from delusions as in the first episode, the 2 first time i was hospiltalized against my will. But i have not been hospitalized for years now. Today i have more control over my delusions maybe becuse i know im sick, i still hear voices and i am on medication. Its diffrent for everybody and they voices could come at any time. I still have delusions, sometimes belive that some one poisons my food, or someone wants to drug me. And i have hallusinations as well, i hear the Wind sounds like words, then i take shower the water sounds like words, my breath sounds like words. And i see shadows. I have been sick for 7 years now
, and the medicine works fine in the begining, i had a drug included psychosis. But at my third episode the medicine didnt work as before, it stopped working becuse i was keeping taking drugs, the didnt tell me that the medicine would stop work if continued with the drugs. Today im out of it, i dont even drink. But i dont know if its still drug psychosis or now more permanent like schizophrenia. Some people say often say this is a forum for people with schizofrenia but its the same symptoms we have, and its good to speak with some one who Can relate.

Probably another thing was learning that discharging myself from services two weeks after being out of hospital and getting my diagnosis was not the best idea.

176077772,"If you do something you are genuinely interested in it can be amazingly rewarding. It’s such a joy to engage with the sharp minds of your professors and your fellow students, so be sure you get the most out of them. You’ll find that most students and almost all professors are passionate about the material and eager to discuss things with you, even outside of class. I especially enjoyed my masters degree, where things got a bit more advanced. Many times my fellow students and me would go for drinks after class and talk more on the topics we discussed during the lectures. In my experience, such discussions benefit greatly to your education, so make sure to reach out to your peers - although just having fun socializing with them should already be a good reason to do so. I myself wasted a few years as an undergraduate not being a very serious student, more into partying etc. Only a year before the first psychosis I switched lanes and became a dedicated student, which I remained during and after the 
folowing psychoses. For me academia was a very welcome distraction and a source of stability in my life with all the mental stuff going on. Clearly, it takes work and effort, and this is a lot more easy to put into it if you’re seriously interested in the material. At first this may be difficult for various reasons, but I found that the more I learned and engaged with the material, the easier it became to put the effort into it. I would find myself reading up on things in the evening not so much because I was falling behind or had a deadline to make, but just because I was passionate to learn more. Truly enriching experience."
176077773,"Ok, well i’ve managed to collect evidence that the telepathy is real. For example, they knew information about my friends circle that I didn’t know, which turned out to be true. Also, my Aunt said she was about to arrive at my house over telepathy, and then she arrived a minute later, and I didn’t even know she was going to be coming. I want to find other people who experience telepathy that they do believe to be real, so that we can discuss the solution. I agree that telling your family would just make them worried."

176077799,"A couple weeks before my dx i read parts of the dsm. Night before i went to the hospital i heard voices for the first time. I was less sick then and when they finally stopped laughing at me i thought to myself “fk, i think i have sz or something, this isn’t right”. I find that early insight helpful when i have doubts. But honestly i still struggle. But i think accepting that there is _USER_ID_, and people hate you or are scared of you without even knowing you -accepting this helps. Accepting that theres nothing fun about sz. Accepting that your life will be filled with more suffering than is normal. My advise, accept the parts of sz that dont have a label, then eventually accepting the dx will seem easy. Idk, im still working on it too."

For me it took about 5 days. The only time I hear voices is when I go through an episode but I can see the cbd preventing me from going through an episode because of how clear it makes me feel. There are currently multiple companies in clinical trials making cbd drugs just for this condition as an antipsychotic."

He threatened to break up with me because I bought him a t shirt and he doesn’t like me buying online and says I can’t afford it. It’s none of his business. We don’t live together and have separate economies. I was hoping he would be happy to get a gift. He has a lot of drama going on in his life though. He is being taken to court and he might be homeless because he is renting his place out to get on top of his finances. Wondering if I should be thankful to my land lady family who said my boyfriend can’t live or stay in my apartment I’m living in. If he lived here he might have become controlling.

Never mind, that they’re asholes who push me to my limit, I have to do what’s best for myself. I only did it like 10 or 15 times in two years, sometimes I don’t think they even heard it. But it’s in my best interest to never do it again, it’s been more than 5 months. Also, no yelling. It’s hard but I’m committed to it. (kind of an ironic statement).

176077829,"So as you all that have read my past posts about brother in law’s, sister in laws and family. I thought I’d bring up my sister in law, my husband’s sister. So she was away helping a friend while they were on their death bed. Ok, now we all were wondering where she was because she said she’d be there shortly. She was a no show and didn’t inform anyone about her whereabouts or situation. She did however leave her 17 year old daughter to convey the message that she’d be absent and why. Nothing, she didn’t inform us and we all became worried for her. We texted and blew up her phone to see if she was in trouble. Ok, now recently she’s been FIRED from her job at _NAME_’s which her mother had helped her get. Her mom (my mother in law) has been a cheerleader and big support for her, then suddenly she fails to call in sick. So she gets fired. She had supposedly made her 17 year old call in sick for her. Anyway, she’s not replied to anyone’s txts or calls. She’s acknowledged them (sai
d her mom) but she says she’s trying to get her life together. I’m starting to see how her BPD affects everyone around her. It was her responsibility to let her mom know what was happening. I say this, because she was PO’_NAME_ when she found out everyone was worried. My husband says everything around her always falls apart, but I’m starting to wonder if SHE is the one CAUSING things to fall apart around her and then complains when it does. How do we help somebody like her? Her daughter has obviously been lashing out at her by what she tells us about her mom. Her mom has abused drugs and people in front of her for years. I am someone she comes to to talk about this, so my question is, how can I help them? At the moment she’s (sister in law) ghosted us, because no calls or replies. Daughter is 17 and is about to graduate in a year, and I’m told sister in law doesn’t want her to graduate. My husband has expressed that his sister is a parasite and he refuses to help them. I feel stuck, because my s
ister in law has helped me in the past. Is this self destructive behavior and how can I help without coming out of this hurt? She’s still unsure if she has Bipolar or BPD. Her daughter says she Bipolar so don’t know."

I’m being put in a PEERS program where I will be in a treatment facility for 5 days. I have more freedom and have group counseling throughout the day everyday.

176077904,"When I was vegan I loved spaghetti bolognese with lentils instead of meat. And banana and peanut butter sandwiches! _NAME_ and _NAME_’s has new vegan ice creams, you could have that for desert, but if ur trying to lose weight I suggest just having ice cream as a treat now and then. I also ate Doritos with baked beans on top, topped with vegan cheese and jalapeños."
176077905,"_AT_MENTION_ That’s the thing, I think about emailing him ALL the time, even as I go about my day. Good advice! I will try and be intentional about focusing on the task at hand and not thinking about contacting him."

Not if you want to get your chance at truly living. When’s the last time you even spoke to your pdoc? Yeah, they’re called cognitive symptoms, and I have them too. Most of us do. Don’t let that stop you. Just because you can’t do what you used to, doesn’t mean that you can’t do anything. Like with my reading, right? Okay, so, I can’t read a young adult novel of medium length, but I can read a news article or read along with an audio book. It may take some time, but we can get better. I have. I can read longer posts now. Granted, you’ve been ill longer than I’ve even been alive, but I have faith in you and your ability to heal your brain some, even if your intellect is never again what it was. Plus, medicine has a future. Fight for that. Fight for the possibility of a cure by accepting that which is less potent, bu
t somewhat helpful, now. Oh, yes, I’m a 20 year old female. And I’m not mature, lol. At least not yet. Now that I’ve been relatively stable for awhile, I’m learning to be more independent, like learning to cook and remembering to take my meds on my own, accepting when I need a prn haldol or ativan, taking care of a dog."
176077907,I’ve asked for a lower mg then they put me back a higher mg. I think your pdoc will know what to do for you.
176077908,"I have some hobbies but I don’t put a lot of effort into them. I really have issues with motivation. I’ve never worked, though a lot of pressure to has been put on me by relatives who don’t understand what I’m going through. I deal with a lot of toxic shame because of it. It’s very hard for me to accept I can’t hold down a job at this point in my life. I’ve never known anyone who couldn’t work because of mental health issues, so it’s hard for me to grasp I’m really less abled than the average person. I plan to try and do some volunteering at my local libray once Covid is over and it’s back to normal to try and do something productive, but for now I’m stuck in my same old routine."
174361809,"The thing is that I still had the same negative symptoms when I stopped meds for 1-2 years. My pdr said in sz with negative symptoms there is parts in the brain low in dopamine while others high in dopamine. They don’t know which are the parts and where they are. Meds normalizes dopamine just in high dopamine parts without raising dopamine in the low dopamine parts. The only thing that helped me a bit, by 30-40% are partial dopamine agonists like Abilify. I am waiting for Vraylar, hopefully it will help."

Results showed that those with Schizophrenia had lower wisdom scores compared to those whop were control participants. Cognitive performance and multiple neurocognitive task performance among those with schizophrenia was higher when they had higher wisdom scores.

174361820,"I’m new to the convo, I haven’t read everything. What’s up with your nurse practitioner? You’re lucky to be in a relationship while having schizophrenia. I believe you can be a success story if you don’t drive your boyfriend away. Talk to him as if you know you’re delusional and you are in a psychosis. I drove people away by not using psychology terms and instead believing something is true because my brain automatically says “this is true”, “North Korea wants to kidnap me because my brain says it is true”. Instead think logically. Use logical terms with your bf and try not to push him away. Make sure he knows that it’s just a psychosis and always be aware of when you are in a psychosis too. By the way, what’s up with your nurse practitioner again? I wish you the best of luck! I’m all ears"
174361817,"Is a faulty hypothesis bro. They can’t make claims of how the brain works because they dont know. Yet, they still arrogant whit those bold claims. Any kind of dopaminergic blockade causes anhedonia."

176077924,"I believe in some kind of omnipotent, benevolent spirit, but I don’t think I believe in the Christian version of God. A lot of it has to do with the existence of hell. How could a benevolent spirit sentence anyone to burn for all eternity? That sounds pretty sadistic to me. I have other questions about God. I’m uncomfortable when people are shouting Praise God, because I have a lot of questions about a benevolent God. How could a benevolent God allow so many horrible things to happen? I won’t go into specifics. One thing I will say is that scientists in the past said there was no evidence of God in the universe. Then when the Hubble space telescope was launched we realize we didn’t know what 94% of the universe was made of. It’s mostly “dark energy” and “dark matter”. So there are plenty of places for God to hide in the universe."

176077928,"The people in my personal life don’t know the details of my “delusions”. My best friend knows some …the few times I’ve been verbal about my thought process it makes things 10x worse. Like if I was to accuse someone of tricking me or reading my mind etc, their (inevitable?) denial would further my suspicions and then it’s all over from there. So yeah, blatantly and/or strongly accusing someone of something just sends me into full psychotic episodes"

And I hate dbt so I dunno why I’m quoting it but maybe it’d help you. Because in dbt you just observe. No need for judgements. It is what it is. I dunno ?

174361821,"So, I’ve been having a lot of trouble with my thoughts for the past 3-4 years. Ever since a very bad breakup. I am on medication which works at times but not always. I suffer from delusions, paranoia, anxiety, depression, insomnia… At one point it felt like someone turned up the volume in my head I have a nurse practitioner who says “it might be schizoaffective disorder, but she has never formally diagnosed me. I know it’s tricky to be diagnosed, but I just wanted to know for myself if I have it or not but didn’t know how to know definitively. Or, what exactly is wrong with me. Any thoughts?"

But if you are taking anxiety meds like benzos or buspar you definitely shouldn’t consume any alcohol."
176077945,"Yeah I agree. It could be worse and it could be better, the rest of upto how we see, deal and respond with whatever we have. Some of us can’t even use a forum or a computer bc we are still stuck in hospital with no light in sight, we are fortunate if we can see it."

176077951,I think psychosis is the price you pay for tapping in to your subconscious creativity. I was very creative and was thinking outside the box when I was psychotic. The problem is that that’s too much for the fleshy thing called the brain.
174361826,"I almost forgot about this girl people know her as black coffee (racist hill folk call her this). I don’t know her real name, but anyway. She was once a very successful young woman/well liked, pageant queen. She was medicated for several years until she tried to live without the meds. Well, now she walks up and down the roads moaning and crying about aliens, spies and hellish things. That’s what happened to her for going off her meds. This is the only case of untreated Schizophrenia I know of."

The main thing I seem interested in is talking about my own problems. There are about 4 things wrong with me socially. 1. Can’t remember names; 2.

All schizophrenics fall into this trap when they think they don’t need medication anymore or they are causing far for side effects that is should. The reality is disappointing and you should never go without the drugs, think what you achieved over your recovery… Do you want to throw it out? Trust me, you don’t want to be psychotic again and lose all your friends or and a job."

Actually, her and her friends were the ones who instigated the game. Me and my two friends were innocent victims, lol. It was a good kiss; soft, right smack on the lips. I never did any heavy making out with a girl until I was 19 and in my first psyche ward. She was about 26 and she knew I liked her and she came up to me when we were alone in the kitchen and just giggled and kissed me and she melted right into me. I made out with her a few other times and she gave me her phone number but I lost it."

But the modern world for the ‘socially poor’ especially, is hard to negotiate because it seems to me, the only options are to be a “poseur” or a “voyeur”… if you want to know what I really think. I have a chip on both shoulders. I am a lone wolf and by and large “I don’t like people very much; and they don’t very much like me” (I understand it’s another movie comparison but at least these moments aren’t set to music, it’s not like a “montage”, which typically gets me.

kicked out of my hands”? Counting to ten more: what I’m saying is I reflect on ‘power’ too much… But … it sure does seem like the whole world upped and became obsessed with it, somewhere along the way. I think about “Need Theory”(Psych 101 stuff) and wonder if I can ever be an affilliator(sp), or an achiever, because I think I’m stuck, evolved into someone who shouts into the jungle, to submit, a last ditch effort(Ok, some drama) to get this whole thing “off me”. I’ve just seen too much, and grew this theory about 'Man"" that in the context of information and being submissive… there exists no true “safe word”… people by rule almost, always hurt and get carried away. I’d like to explore the posing and voyeuristic thought line though. That’s important.

Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. However, the role of Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 in behavioural phenotypes and brain changes relevant to autism spectrum disorder have not been evaluated. We show that Neuronal calcium sensor-1 deletion in the mouse leads to a mild deficit in social approach and impaired displaced object recognition without affecting social interactions, behavioural flexibility, spatial reference memory, anxiety-like behaviour, or s

At the level of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, Neuronal calcium sensor-1 deletion leads to a reduction in long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus, but not area Cornu Ammonis 1. Metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced long-term depression was unaffected in both dentate and Cornu Ammonis 1.

176078050,I’m sorry to hear that _PERSON_. Sounds like he is a little ungrateful to the things your mom does for him? You have less than a week before you go back to the doctor and if you could just hold out and hang on for just a few more days your whole life might change And also when your trying out new medicine It sometimes takes a few weeks to kick in and get some great relief And sometimes side effects only last a week or so. So try to keep that in mind when she prescribes you something Make sure you are telling her how you feel Like it looks like your down in the dumps and anxious. That helps them a lot to figure out what meds to give you faster It’s team work for you and your doctor
176078051,"I tried. I tried twice to give a few bucks to ragged people with signs asking for money alongside the road. The first guy I was stuck two lanes away from him. The second person was a women . It was a bad vibe on both our parts and the dilemma is: should I give money to a person who I may not like and may not like me? On one hand no one should go hungry but should I give money to someone who disrespects me or doesn’t like me on sight.? My last good deed was a couple of weeks ago that I forgot about. I pulled into the _NAME_’s drive way and saw to my right, an obviously homeless person. It was an older lady and she didn’t notice me. I drove thru and got a salad and parked and I could see her in my rear view mirror. She curled herself into a ball and was not aware of anything going on around her. I thought she might be sick. And I sat for a minute and thought, if she’s sick and needs medical attention do I really want to get involved with talking to cops and EMT’s and ambulances? I didn’t 
want the complication but after I wrestled with my conscience for a minute I decided to try to help her. I walked up to her ready to either call for help or give her money to eat. I walked up to her and asked her if she was alright. She almost was crying and she said, “I’m so hungry.” So I pulled out a $5.00 bill and another guy in a car pulled up to us and he had a $5.00 bill and he gave it to me to give to her. Thinking about it now, a five dollar bill to someone who is starving is almost nothing. I wished I would have given her more. But she thanked me. And I was glad I could help her get a meal."

I think you should at least text them or email them. You can even be short if you are not feeling up to socialising g just say so. I isolated from everyone and suffered. Now I have friends I have lost and I can’t even remember why but I lost some when I was delusional and some when I was religious for a year .

176078063,That’s how I got myself to walk after a leg injury when I was a child. I never noticed myself doing it until now. I do walking every morning when I wake up. I knew I had doubts about my ability to walk. Now I know where they came from. It is only a little painful to wake up to. I had gone numb to it. But I am optimistic. I can relearn how to walk. My right leg is just weaker than the left. I can strengthen it and do better.

174361857,Hi _AT_MENTION_ I’m actually diagnosed with schizophrenia and I don’t want to frighten you but that’s exactly how things started out for me. I’m not saying you have schizophrenia but you should definitely see a psychiatrist and get their opinion.
176078065,When I was a kid we would play ding dong ditch. I now realize how unkind that was.
174361852,"By ‘alien’ I mean feelings that I never experienced before in my life, feelings that normal people don’t experience, feelings that perhaps no other being has ever experienced on this planet. I don’t have inappropriate emotions. I have no emotions at all. I wouldn’t call the feelings I get as inappropriate, in the sense of a dysfunctioning brain/mind producing inappropriate emotions. The feelings I get don’t stem from simple dysfunction - they’re being produced/controlled by something intelligent. By ‘intelligent’ I mean some unnatural process in my brain, consciousness or soul, that recognizes and understands things I see and hear, and reacts to those things in a particular way. For example, every time I see a young woman it applies some visual vibe to them. One day I saw some images of women, and it applied a pleasant/pretty vibe to them. The next time I saw those imagtes again it applied a intensely menacing vibe to those women. It does this quite often - first gives something a 
good appearance, then next time it won’t apply the pleasant vibe any more, or even applies an unpleasant vibe. The voices have told me it’s doing this to induce disappointment: supposedly I expect to see a pleasant/pretty vibe every time because I saw a pleasant/pretty looking women before, but instead my schizophrenia applies a neutral or unpleasant vibe to them. Also, the things I call ‘feelings’ and ‘vibes’ are 2 different categories of things I experience, and they are not emotions. To get a better picture of what I mean by those 2: Vibes: This is an ‘addition’ to the senses. There can be vibes for all senses: visual, auditory, olfactory and gustatory. If you have seen a beautiful woman, the ‘beauty’ is a visual vibe - a visual effect that your brain applies applies to an image of a woman. The vibes I experience are unnatural. For example it has made music sound like death. Nothing should sound like death, because there is no such thing as the sound of death in the real world; yet I ex
perience such things. Feelings: Not all feelings are emotions, for example physical pain. Just like pain, this ‘fake funny’ feeling is something that I can physically feel in my body - in the face to be precise. My face does not have to be smiling for it to apply this strange feeling. There are countless of different alien non-emotion feelings that I experience in my body or mind every day."

174361854,"Well, this is probably a delusion, but i think I was at most 3 different people. _NAME_ parsons and _NAME_ v from possibly Austria. My life has been ????. Not sure if this is my original life or what. The time tables don’t match too. There’s practically nothing worse than a severe mental illness in my case. The only thing worse is aliens. Similar to serac from westworld in an extremely loose way, I remember running in weeds or grass in Austria in one of my first lives and having to go to _NAME_ aspergers cuz I had autism. I went to the damn clinic…my friend or brother stayed behind. I had an older friend/brother I think in a past life… My mom was a poet and I dont remember my dad. Not sure if I was a clone or time traveled or am a vampire. I think Aspergers or dyslexia is a billion times better than schizophrenia which the elite dont care about and dont want it cured. They like oil and hate free energy and make trillions off sick people and knock people off that care about the greater good, 
helping people, inventors, and people that can make more money than them and are smarter. Its the old vs new money thing. Great Gatsby sort of stuff. They run our governments and control everything and more! Ive been me (_NAME_ over a million times) and I’m stuck in a time loop with schizophrenia since 2011 for eternity. Probably Nordic aliens are to blame… So yes, my 3 options suck and I never live a long, great life. The best life I ever had was outside the simulation running reality and without schizophrenia. I think I went through that German bell time machine in a distant past life and ended up reincarnated a trillion lifetimes ago. Probably remembering, talking about it is why I ended up disabled, poor, insane, and in monarch/montauk programming. I feel like I’m the world’s most tortured suffering person in history. The only thing that gives me comfort is Christ. That’s why I’m not scared anymore. I am a victim of circumstance and what happened to me was inhuman. Shame on you!!!"

176078107,Loss of muscle mass is one reason I chose to go on testosterone injections. I’m doing everything I can to fight aging. I want to be able to exercise till I’m an old man. It is really the only hobby I have and it makes me feel good.
176078108,"I was on a zoom today and there was a guy on it who is a job support specialist who deals with cases like mine and similar, i tried it a couple years ago but thought about doing it again, it sounds like a much improved service than before, I’m not sure if i can fit in a job atm though with all the other stuff i do"
176078109,"I’m doing good, thank you…"
176078110,"I was a complete and total loner in high school. I walked the school corridors alone, without one sole friend throughout high school and college. I wasn’t bullied. People pretty much left me alone and ignored me, which was mostly fine with me. I haven’t changed much in all of these years."
176078111,"A reporter for the New York Times wrote that he went to a baseball game and a young man yelled out… “Hey _PERSON_! You suck!!” An elderly man with his wife was in earshot and told the young man to watch his language in front of the lady! A reverse-generational example, I suppose."
176078112,The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
176078113,"I had to look up the word, “trudge” because I don’t use it very often. Here is the definition: to walk wearily: to walk, or walk a particular path or distance, with slow heavy weary steps. That makes sense to me. I hope someday we can overcome. But in the meantime your poem is accurate."

176078126,That is very similar to what happens to me.
176078127,"It’s a good job as long as your legs, and feet hold up. I found using the stools helped with the low and high shelves when I did it. My problem was I moved on to what looked like a better job, but I found out to my sorrow that sitting in a chair, and taking the full dose of meds in order to think at my highest level led to rapid weight gain and soon my body was no longer able to do the laborious stuff. I also had trouble with insomnia possibly due to staring at a computer screen all day. That was my last job."

176078129,yikes!! thank you for informing me. that is disgusting. yours are much better! have a wonderful day
176078130,I didn’t say that. I said being in bed 90% of my time makes me irritable and angry on myself and on everyone.
176078131,"Yeah, because they don’t study pharmacology at all while they’re becoming doctors nor do they have access to medical literature and studies on supplementation."
176078132,All stimulants carry a risk of psychosis as a side effect. They usually aren’t recommended for people with psychosis. Sarcosine is a supplement that has helped me get the motivation to complete my daily tasks.
176078133,"Everything that happened in my psychosis was real (minus a few minor auditory hallucinations like a a guy saying “idiot” coming from the direction of the closest person, and I think - one “alternate reality” with a seamless transition in and out). But that last part is only for the ~one night that it gets really deep. I’ve validated most of the other stuff. Maybe ~50% was actually said and I interpreted correctly, 10% inference not interpreted correctly, 30% inference interpreted correctly and 10% mis-interpretation on my part (based on associations with invalid beliefs that I held - some of which were extraordinarily complex and scary). But that last 10% created beliefs that scared the ???? out of me. Like I was in the process of strategising against both ASIO (Australia’s Intelligence Agency) and the CIA in order to convince them of something and prove my innocence over something I dreamt up my mate had actually done, and was afraid I’d end up hog-tied in Guantanamo Bay."
176078134,"That’s so awesome! It’s fun to be fit, right? Just two years ago I was working with a trainer 2x a week, and my body could do so much!! Now, I can’t even walk a mile without being in pain and exhausted. Stick with it as long as you can!!"
176078135,Amisulpride was my first ap. Didn’t work
176078136,"well, I think you’re troubled, and maybe I missed it that you’ve been given a diagnosis."
176078138,I think you should increase the Clozapine if you have a lot of positives positives. My mum is hospitalized at the mental hospital where they switched her from Clopixol to Zyprexa because she couldn’t tolerate Clopixol any more. She is really unwell on the 15 mg Zyprexa. I really hope they place her on Clozapine because that’s the only one that works when no options are left.
176078139,Don’t tell me what to do!
176078140,I believe in SIMS. I have no control over my life anymore. They play us

176078144,Get treatment now rather than later. Even if it’s the big C there’s plenty of really good treatments coming online that make a huge difference. Yeah it can be a tough cop sometimes but it’s in your best interests to find out what is up. I get weird things all the time with bloodwork. You might not be in as bad a way as you think.
176078145,Like a dog chasing his own tail.
176078146,"Wow! There is a huge hardware store called Harbor Freight Tools in our town. It’s got every tool one could ever need. My dad has a big tool collection too, it’s quite impressive."
174361874,Ok. You’re basically off meds if you’re only on 5mg.
174361872,Interesting. It’s a diuretic. But also possibly tumorigenic so not sure this would be suitable for regular use.
176078147,Me too but I am sure you weren’t like that since you were born. Well at least in my case. For me up until 15 y.o. I had my original good personality then from 15 until my diagnosis at 20 y.o. it was worse. Then it got better on meds but not as good as before 15 y.o.
176078148,Do people feel reluctant to talk?
176078149,I need to look elsewhere to have a real influence on someone or something.
176078150,"I acutally want to apologize to everybody on the forum, but particularly one individual. I want to give my apologies to the whole forum for being so argumentative and insensitive in the past with my comments. But there is one incident where I feel great regret over. Basically, someone had posted something about transgenders, and ninjastar asked everyone to not be transphobic, or hateful. I was being very asinine and contentious that morning, so I let everyone know my thoughts on it, irregardless of the warning of suspension. Nevertheless, I said some pretty insensitive stuff about transgenders, with thinking just because I believed I was right, it meant it should have been uttered. I was a very irascible person then, which is something I have sinced fixed. That, however, is no excuse. I want to apologize to _AT_MENTION_ for the unkind words I wrote, without even realizing there might have been some members saddened and felt rejected for the words I said. I’m sorry."
176078151,"If i was stuporous i wouldn’t be able to write this but today i progressed into not thinking as much, my mind is quieter… I often feel disconnected from my actions, like the way i walked stiffly or sometimes stereotypically, over time since i got ill i became repetative in some sense. Now i’m having derealization on this cold summer day. I just feel different now, i can’t put my finger on it, but not dissociation, that used to be normal. I don’t know if i should call my psychiatrist."
176078152,Console gaming is an addiction. There was one time similar to your when I just got a new computer game and I played it all day. I didn’t eat and went to the washroom when needed. All I did was play that game all day until I finished it.

176078155,Geodon just at night didn’t work for me although I did it for years. I thought getting psychotic every day was just normal. Eventually the morning sedation goes away. I don’t get it anymore. I take the maximum recommended dose 80 mg at night and 80 in the morning but I did stay skinny on just Geodon. I added Latuda on top of that about 4 years ago so now I take 2 APs but with that I put on 50 pounds. But I am a tall guy. I just have a little belly and I am nearly 50 so I am okay with it. Short version is Geodon has a short half life. If you have bad psychosis just at night won’t work but it is better than nothing. I did it for years but now I am holding down a job. I couldn’t do that when I only took it at night. Good luck.
176078156,To fully work. 15
176078157,"Total yes, I went thru a medical group that had them that from very beginning to the new. The first pdoc I had dealt with kickbacks to put people on some not so good ideas ones. But there’s a lot older that are not recommended unless last resort. The side effects are brutal, and I was switched after 2 weeks on them if I saw no sign of a result. I don’t recommend NP _PERSON_ if you ever get stuck in rural SD. Her goal was to zombie you out, it was considered fair treatment and if you couldn’t function, you were on your way. I lost years of my kids lives and memories because of her."
176078158,The reason I never put a response to this thread. I dont live some structured lifestyle where I plan out what I’m doing for the day. Because of negative symotoms and lack of motivation. I just do what I feel like that day.

176078160,"When on meds, my doc told me no more than 3 hard drinks a week. Now, with only xanax she said no drinks within 4 hours of a dose, and preferably no more than a drink a day.

When I take more of it I become depressed, so my psych says 5mg is the perfect dose for me although she claims it is lower than average dose. It does help me a lot.

Then the devil started talking to me saying I had already enslaved myself by taking a physical form. I was enslaved to the needs and whims of my body as well as the demands of living in the human world. So why not be enslaved to him as well and receive pleasure from it? He tried to get me to “give myself” to him, whatever that may mean. And I snapped out of it last second and said hell no. He basically tries to get me super aroused and full of desire then tries to say if you worship me and serve me I will satisfy that desire. But I know it isn’t worth it and I will never devote myself to him. So it’s really stupid."

Makes it impossible to accept a compliment because I believe the voices and think people only say them to get something, or are making fun of me because they can’t really mean those nice things. My therapist has me force myself to say a positive about my looks, it’s hard sometimes, and half the time I don’t know If I believe it. But it helps.

176078193,Yes it sucks and it’s my worst addiction by far. I try and quit and then I return to it.
176078194,_AT_MENTION_ That’s great. It brings some rationality to the question of why I might feel bad. The best one for me is whether something recently went wrong that might have caused the bad feelings. But all of them are helpful. Thank you for finding that. I am already seeing some reasons.
174361890,Do you feel negative symptoms frequently?

It feels like a time loop sort of like Edge of Tomorrow and what about the aliens and simulation theory? Like what if they are going planet to planet and taking me along with them? Each planet earth could be a matrix or simulation (or a simulation within a simulation). I never figured it all out like what happened to me. I know for a fact I posted some stuff like (I time traveled, I was a time traveler, we live in a computer, we live in the matrix, and some other possible stuff). But what if they were on other planets and all the memories and psychosis I am experiencing is from other planets? I think this could be possible. That I’m going planet to planet. So is 
it possible nothing happened to me besides some false memories or something? I have memories of time constantly resetting like Edge of Tomorrow and that I come back alive with some memories and experiences in tack. I feel like I could have graduated from my university but I felt compelled or forced to drop out. Like I graduated a few times out of infinity just like I got my schizophrenia cured a few times out of infinity. This has been going on for an eternity and infinity pretty much. So I am delusional but nothing happened in most regards. It’s all in my head, I guess. Like I remember history or my past being different sometimes. Like I tried going back in 2013/2014 and I got sick, but what if I did go back? What if I made it before. I think I did, but now I realized I need to move on and not look back.

Nightmares going on 31 years, started at 4 with first sexual assault, then DV in middle school and fighting off my mom’s boyfriend for several years as he tried to get into my bed and I never told anyone until after his death, but he did end up waiting until my middle sister turned 18 and she needed drug money, but he and my mom had been broken up for a long time. Mom doesn’t know sister and ex ?????? transactionally until he died when she was 25 and he was almost 55. He started dating my mom when she was 22, with an 8 year old, 4 year old and 6 month old. Then dumped her once she turned 30 because she was too old for him, he was 43. Then my to be father in law assaulted me the few weeks I was 17 under his roof, and really did it the first 3 months I was 18 and pregnant with my oldest. I didn’t turn him in as he had gotten ahold of my bank details from his wife who worked at my bank, she also walked in on him doing it and turned around and walked 
out. _NAME_ and i got our apartment in April 2003, married june 2003 and they dated show up. I could have had him killed by my grandfather and my husband on my wedding day, but we were in the courthouse, so i really didn’t want to lose my grandfather and new husband to life in prison. Then i have an assault in my last psych ward stay where I was in a locked unit but rooms had no doors, and I was the only female in there at age 22. 15 min checks never occurred, the nurses did 2 stops a shift, and that was to see if you had killed yourself yet. I faked choking to death to get the guy to leave my ripped a poo art clothes on me. So, PTSD nightmares are completely something else.

You’ll get there. Just keep yourself open to new experiences and just get out there…Join a club that interests you.

176078363,You said you chased them
176078364,"Thanks for checking in _NAME_! I hopefully have ot back in control. I have renewed focus and determination. I’m trying something that may or may not work, we shall see. Overall I need to cut carbs down a lot on days I dont workout. I’m not going full keto, but I plan to use some methods found in keto. I dont think keto is all that healthy or sustainable which is why I’m not going full keto. Intermittent fasting is the difference maker! It’s been working great. These next two weeks I’m going to try keto fasting, which is eating something high in fat during your “fast” which supposedly helps you reach ketosis during your fast. I’m skeptical about that, but decided to give it a try. There hasnt been any good study to show if it works or not so I’m kind of going off of anecdotes, but I figured might as well try."
176078365,"I’m doing fine, thanks, Are you only on perphenazine?"
176078366,I never did either but warn your close friends and family.
176078367,Perhaps you snore or have apnea? Have you had that checked out??
174361929,"Hi there! I take Abilify and this is not at all what I experienced. Great job on documenting how it made you feel, by the way. It sounds like Abilify is not the right anti-psychotic for you. I am curious though as to what you think you may have, since you say you were misdiagnosed with “differential psychosis”. Differential psychosis generally includes substance abuse, brief psychotic disorder, MDD episodes with psychosis, etc. So we can’t really help you here. I’d say your pdoc made a diagnosis based on what you shared with them, or your therapist. Do you think you have DID? That might be a good thing to bring up to your pdoc. I won’t recommend a medication, as I know nothing about pharmacology, but as someone who suffers from schizoaffective disorder, I can say that that “blank mind” you mentioned was a cure for me. So I’m worried that you might be down the wrong path. Hope this message finds you well <3"
176078368,Today i felt more energetic at work and actually maintained a conversation with my coworkers

Then take all my clothes off and just smear the rest all over my entire body and then roll all over the carpet.

176078403,"I’m with you _AT_MENTION_ , I often feel like anything I say is wrong, that everyone hates me, that I screw up anything I do. Voices often reinforce that feeling, telling me what I’ve done wrong, picking on what I do. It causes a lot of insecurity, and fear. I often have to reality check that it’s just me, and not true. And try to push through the day. I’m wishing you some relief, I wish I had more to offer in ways of coping."

174361934,"Absolutely. I’m terrified of what the future will hold as I unpack not only what I will experience from medications and therapy, but the ramifications of the things that I said and did while I was in the grip of schizophrenia and not thinking clearly. In theory, it’s all recoverable over a period of years as long as I can stomach it. But in practice, I thought I had been through the worst parts of my life and it was just the beginning. I thought a few years from now I would be in a much better position than I was a few years ago. But I’m at the absolute low point now. I’m getting too old for this."

It took me a long time to finally forgive my abuser, but I still wouldnt reconnect with them. Let go of your guilt, free yourself from the impossible responsibility you’ve placed upon yourself. I’m trying to do that myself, but it’s hard. So very hard. Here’s the worst part, we can forgive people who have abused us in insanely traumatic ways, but we cant forgive ourselves for wrongs we have done. That doesn’t seem fair, does it? Be kind to yourself. Try to start the healing process with doing small and large acts of self love."

176078434,I kind of confronted my doctor yesterday and questioned my diagnosis that she gave me. I basically lost trust I had in her and doubted her judgement. This can’t be a good thing between patient and doctor. I should not have questioned her better judgement. I have the right to my opinion but I should never play doctor. I crossed the line. The bottom line is I feel the need to apologize. I have her cell phone number that she gave me. Should I text her an apology or talk with her over the phone? Ugh… I really need to make this better.

I wish I could extract/ and reverse engineer this more often and identify how exactly I got here - so I could save it for a rainy day. And help others do the same. To put a fine point on it, I thought I saw some of my influence in your ‘share’ here, but I don’t want to detract either from the creativity, resentment is a huge topic rehearsed a lot in A.A. and I think that’s what makes people hit the bottle. I’ll never stop introversion though. I think about Mother _NAME_ who was kind/but maybe she was running from something, distancing herself from negative emotions she had internally. And at the same time maybe someone like _PERSON_ the _PERSON_ was more consistent in heart, mind, and “soul”. And should be dug up more and discussed more.

176078492,_AT_MENTION_ - How did you get to be on such a low dose of Invega. Did you taper down slowly or they started you off with that dose. I also want to go lower but am a little scared. Went for a 20min walk and then sprinted. It got my bowels to empty out. I’m feeling good. I think the prune and apple juice combo helped.
174361966,I wish they would do some useful studies instead of spending funding on crap like this.

176078494,I was a ‘social loner’ way before developing severe mental illness. Periodic failed attempts at socialising have made me more asocial. I rated at classical autism level for social communication. The 2 places I fit in best online are here and the high IQ societies I belong to. The latter even after outing myself as a person with _PERSON_’s and severe mental illness. From 2009-2019 I amassed about 55 friends . In the last 8 months or so it’s gone up to 146. Almost all those 91 are high IQ people. who have approached me to be friends.
176078495,"People aren’t inherently evil. Not in my experience. Selfishness isn’t evil. Its just nature. Nature is what it is. The rules had to be something and they just got divvied up into the way things are now. I think hating people is a waste of energy. Far better to not care. Kids can be mean though, kids deal with a world that puts a lot of pressure on them and a lot of rules without any freedom. Adults tend to forget how hard it is to be a kid."

176078512,The bars and restaurants are so noisy and there are too many people there and I was completely freaking out.

I’ve been learning that non-autistic people are getting constant feedback from other people in social situations and are able to naturally take perspective when interacting with them. For me, I’m not picking up on that feedback, so the interactions are more fraught and likely to cause paranoia."

Is it perhaps that my sza symptoms are actually just from my BPD? Although one thing is that with BPD, AP’S don’t make a difference with psychosis so much and one can take it short term. But with me I have to take it long term because every time I stopped I got ill again My observation though, is that the main symptoms I’m being helped with in taking AP’S is the aggression and emotional/thought storms. It did help psychosis as well though Just wonderin
g if my sza symptoms can be just due to BPD Going to ask my pdoc next time as well. See her on Wednesday again."

176078545,ok this is a stretch for me… just putting that out there. but glossing over a few things… it’s like reverse engineering the kinematics of an existing system… in order to design a secondary system.

Looking at a map of interrelated motion… like a chain made of links… and then trying to re-establish that dynamic system of non-original links.

176078592,I think the best way to lose weight is by eating less and healthier. When I exercise I always put on weight because I eat more. I just bought a exercise DVD from a second hand shop and it promises you lose weight in thirty days if you exercise twenty minutes every day so I’m going to give it a go. I am going to try to only have fruit for lunch. Difficult as I love my food. I am a size ten and want to be size eight. I was around eighty kg when I was on other medication. I’m not obese but I prefer myself a size eight but in my older age i can’t eat much at all if I’m going to get there again. I adore eating and have not managed to discipline myself yet.

So here I am in ER… wondering what the drs are going to do with an unstable very suicidal schizophrenic with a drug dependency that can’t get herself into rehab for weeks… What do you guys think is gonna happen to me? Please nothing negative I can’t take it right now. I trust this community to be supportive…

Lamotrigine (like you said) is known like a mood stabilizer. My question would be in fact If I take clomipramine alone , there is some improvment in my mood. If I take clomipramine along with lamotrigine, I think it’s different because the antidepressant effect of clomipramine is disturbed with the combination of lamotrigine. It’s an assumption. Is it possible ? My psychiatrist said no. But recently a friend said why not. And moreover, if it’s the case, can I take clomipramine at a low dosage to limit the manic risk ?"

176078619,"Smart. Once you lend money to people it never stops. I’ve lent money to about 5 leeches in places I’ve lived in the past 25 years and once they hook you by lending them money a few times, they’ll just keep coming back forever. And I also know from experience that inevitably after several times lending them money they are going to start paying you back late. I’ve seen this pattern with all five bloodsuckers I lent money to, even if they are friends. To them, you are the bank where they can get money whenever they feel like it. And yes, the longer it goes on they get in the habit of paying you back late or borrowing larger and larger amounts. I had an ex-roommate who we were friends for a short while and we both moved far apart but he still hounded me for money. He was actually one person who almost always payed me back on time but the amounts got larger and we had a falling out and I thought I had seen the last of him and none to soon. He called three weeks later and actually tried to get me 
to lend him $800! I had the money but it would have emptied my bank account. I mean, I’m a lousy janitor for a living and he had no job and he expected me to risk losing $800 when we lived ten miles apart and we weren’t really friends anymore? And he thought this was a good idea. I said no and that ended the friendship but he still owed me $60.00 from previously but he didn’t even have the decency or the class to pay me what he owed me. _NAME_, I wonder what would have happened if I loaned him the $800? And lastly, another trick these guys pull to try to con you is to promise they will pay you back more than you’ve lent them. I had a guy who kept borrowing money who would always promise to give me an extra $20 more when I lent him money. He gave me this line so many times and I think in 4 months he did it once. Yeah, they’ll come up with any excuse in the book as to why they can’t pay you back on time. And this is why I don’t lend money any more. I came up with a saying that I learned from exper
ience. “When you lend people money, it always ends up that they make their problems into your problems.” Smart move not lending the guy the money."

My buddy was way out in right field wearing this huge ten gallon cowboy hat he had put on from the party we had just came from. So the lady police officer gets out of her car and yells at my buddy… “Hey _PERSON_! Get over here NOW!!” We couldn’t stop laughing.

Just like when you do alot of reps over a period of time and your bicepts gets bigger.-same with the heat.

176078721,First of all I’ll state I’m not hearing voices . I am though saying a lot of expletive. deleted comments out loud . I do sometimes swear but nothing like to the extent I’ve been doing recently . It just seems to slip out without my thinking about it . Luckily I haven’t been doing it when with other people.
174362031,My internal voice controls me but on 10 mg abilify it’s a good balance. On 20 mg I barely “felt” it. On 0 mg it makes me its ?????. I also have delusions I’m being controlled by god or something but I don’t believe that’s a delusion but people tell me it kinda is.
176078722,It’s ramping down. Not even on meds today. Just doing fine. My regimen rocks.
174362045,Ur welcome. I am too afraid to go on another one. Because abilify is meant to be most activating Also it is not significantly anticholinergic I hear med swaps can trigger positive symptoms and that’s another thing I don’t want
176078723,Thanks _AT_MENTION_

I think it’s dangerous. He doesn’t slowly increase med dosage. Even the nurse got shocked. Doctors aren’t perfect. I had one doctor give me NMS, but that’s another story for another day… At least you will save gas money and time. It’s good to have family friends. Might be good. It might be good to have another opinion. In therapy, they mentioned people do doctor shopping, which I don’t, but I don’t have a problem with that unless it gets out of touch with reality.

176078826,"Buy a bag of frozen mixed veggies, put it in a pot with a can of coconut milk, add curry powder, ginger, and cayenne pepper to taste. Voila! Coconut curry! And it costs like $4 if you buy the spices in bulk. Dice an onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms and sauté them. Add two drained cans of black beans (or prepared dried black beans to save even more money) a can of diced tomatoes, garlic, and taco seasoning. Simmer until most of the liquid boils away and you have taco filling! Tofurkey beer brats are by far the tastiest of the vegan hot dogs, and easiest to grill. Morningstar products are a bit more expensive, but very protein-heavy and filling, so you end up eating less than you think you’ll need. My advice is not to buy products that are meant as meat substitutes. They’re never as good, and they just taste like the ghost of a delicious food. Instead, go for interesting seasonings and flavors. There’s a vegan apple sausage I really like, and black bean burgers. Beans/lentils mixed with rice 
and a can of diced tomatoes is always filling and enjoyable, and peanut butter is another cheap but useful product. Potatoes have a lot of nutrients, especially if you leave on the skin. Buy frozen veggies instead of fresh when you can to save money and time, and because they last longer. Microwave frozen broccoli for a few minutes, then spread it on a pan with a bit of _NAME_ oil and garlic salt and stick it in the oven on 400 for fifteen minutes. It tastes amazing."

RA _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Molecular psychiatry , Aug 30 2019 The response to antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia appears to vary, and as such it has been proposed that different subtypes of schizophrenia exist, defined by treatment-response. This has not been formally examined using _NAME_-analysis. Randomised controlled trials comparing placebo and antipsychotics in acute treatment of schizophrenia listed in PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO from inception until 30 November 2018 were examined. Relative variability of symptomatic improvement in antipsychotic-treated individuals compared to placebo-treated individuals was quantified using coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). Mean difference in symptom change was quantified using _PERSON_ g. In addition, individual patient data from two clinical trials was examined in terms of both 
the distribution of total symptom change, and the variability of individual symptoms and symptom factors. In total, 11,006 articles were identified.

176078886,"So my employer had a barbeque for us at work today. With my supervisors and co-workers and us. I’ll admit a lot of it sucked but there were some interesting “moments”. First of all, we’re all disabled, no big deal. My co-worker kept giving me the evil eye today, I don’t know WTF his problem was today. I don’t hate him or anything but it made me mad. But you learn something about yourself and then forget about it. And today something came up that I admit I relished. The guy was staring at me. Fine but then he started doing it so much that it he made himself look weird and awkward. And that made me happy. On one level I always think i’m the lowest person in most situations and I think everybody else is cool and self composed. But this guy overdid it big-time and he just made himself look bad. Everytime he stared at me I stared back. Then (and remember this is at our job with our bosses watching. Then he just got up and was walking around and I thought to myself, ""Man here’s someone w
ho I thought was fairly normal but he’s acting so weird that it kind of made me look like the normal one! Good. Screw him. And then the barbeque was outdoors and everybody was sitting at tables and I was kind of standing on the edge of the group until I bit the bullet and joined everybody. And I felt a little like I was odd man out but I did my best and offered great insights on how the universe works and stunned everybody with my intellect. Uh will the court reporter please strike that last line, it was a lie. But I did say some funny stuff and I did OK. But then I noticed a few people felt exactly like I did and they got up and stood away from everybody. Anyways, the coolest part was that I discovered our two women bosses were totally cool and funny. I have a very high opinion of them now. Another cool thing was I was talking with my co-worker who I’ve been working with for 6 years and we had a realy good conversation even after all these years. I love getting along with people!

Immovane is good though and I still use that when needed. I took half a immovane last night and slept from about 11 pm to 6 am. Some night I sleep 7.30 pm to 6 am. Most nights that is what I aim for without sleeping tablets. I am so happy my sleeping got better because I think I was addicted to immovane for a while. I needed it. It’s been really hot the last couple of nights and I have no air conditioning and the fan didn’t help much it was too hot think we had over 40c. Hope you get more sleep again.

176078903,"As someone who’s been through nursing school, I do not ever want to get my sons if I have them circumcised . Before my OB rotation I thought a circumcision was a quick little snip and then it was done. No. I encourage anyone who wants to get their son a circumcision to first watch videos on the procedure. The baby’s penis is smashed into this weird torture looking device, pinned with numerous clothespins, they stick a long needle looking thing down into the skin, it goes on. A lot of the time no pain medication is used at all or the doctor comes too late so the pain medication has already worn off so the babies are absolutely screaming in agony the whole time. All this for purely cosmetic reasons. Yes, there are actually practically no benefits to circumcision despite popular opinion,latest research is showing. The one thing it does is you can’t get phymosis if you have a circumcision (when your foreskin gets stuck closed) but this is an extremely rare condition. In fact circumcision just red
uces sexual feeling. I do not believe in putting an infant through such a procedure purely for the benefit of having their penis look a certain way. If when my sons get older they decide they want a circumcision for themselves then I will gladly support their decision, but I will not make a baby who cannot consent go through that torture and genital mutilation."

Once that house is clean then you can tackle the problem of keeping it clean But having it done will take a load off your mind and relieve stress and then you have a little leeway on what to do next and what problem to tackle next. There’s no shame in getting help occasionally to clean your house. Maybe you can just plan to have a cleaning lady to come every two months and the rest of the time in between you can do it yourself or get help from the kids. Hell, when I was 15 I had to do the dinner dishes every night, clean the bathroom once a week and occasionally do laundry. I fought every night to get out of doing those but I always lost.

174362091,"It has been estimated that up to 10 percent of patients treated with clozapine develop obsessive-compulsive symptoms. And I’m in the 10 percent category. I’m constantly washing my hands and face/eyes. There are many studies pointing clozapine with OCD. http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/381.full.pdf Still, multiple case reports describe this phenomenon. It has been hypothesized that clozapine’s antiserotonergic effects are responsible for the emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (_PERSON_ 1992), which have been reported to abate spontaneously after 1 to 3 weeks (Patil 1992) or to respond to a decrease in dosage https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-_PHONE_NO_ Emergence of obsessive compulsive symptoms during treatment with clozapine. Explored the relationship between clozapine, a potent antagonist of serotonin receptors, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which have been linked to deficient serotonin. The treatment of 49 chronic schizophrenic patients with clozap
ine was reviewed, and 5 patients (aged 33–41 yrs) were identified who experienced either de novo obsessive-compulsive symptoms or exacerbation of preexistent symptoms. Clinical details are provided for each case. It is concluded that clozapine may produce or unmask obsessive-compulsive symptoms. This may reflect a variation on the normal course of clinical improvement or may more specifically result from clozapine’s atypical pattern of CNS receptor antagonism.

Clozapine’s antiserotonergic properties could be related to the emergence of OCBs https://onlinelibrary._NAME_.com/doi/full/10.1111/j._PHONE_NO_.01362.x The results support earlier findings which suggest that clozapine produces or unmasks OCS. https://journals.lww.com/drug-monitoring/Abstract/2006/06000/Higher_Plasma_Drug_Concentration_in.6.aspx The authors suggest that the emergence of these side effects may be related to higher Cps of clozapine and clinicians should routinely check for and manage these side effects.

176078997,"Go back 6 years and my life was pretty hellish. I believed people could hear my thoughts, I thought dead people were mentally torturing me and it happened all day long and I never got a break. I believed a lot of the things that the voices told me and it just made things more and more complicated as I believed in more and more things. Then one day, out of stress more than anything I just started telling myself that the thing that annoyed me the most out of everything, the idea that you could communicate with people in your head was not real. Then I actually started to question it and it actually dawned on me that there actually was not any way to communicate with people in my head, and I got the thing wrong the whole time. After that, everything that I used to believe in, the dead people what they were saying, it was all not true as well because how could it be if the voices were not real? So basically, everything I believed in went away, pretty quickly, I currently didn’t believe anything that j
ust happened to me during the whole illness. To be honest, it made me feel a bit sick, I even heard massive cracks and bangs in my head for a short time after the change. But quite quickly I started to feel like it was over, relief is the thing I felt mostly, that all the things that bothered me so much could just go away and I would never have to deal with them again. My voices stopped pretty quickly, and within a pretty short time period, I was voice free. I think that was the biggest turning point for me in the illness. Although admittedly afterwards, and for a long time, we are talking about a good amount of years, I was pretty unwell, racked with paranoia which often led me to believe in things again. But mostly it was temporary and I could overcome what the paranoia and general uneasiness of life was like at the time. Slowly after that, things got better and better my paranoia slowly resided, and bit by bit I started getting pieces of my life together and was able to get on with things. Now my only prob
lems really are social anxiety and that I have not got my employment sorted out fully. But overall, I think in the whole illness, that was the one idea that changed things, and was probably one of the best things to happen to me on the road to recovery. (TLDR; how I overcame sz and the one thing that made me ill was the belief that you could communicate with people in your head.)"

In this case _AT_MENTION_ … If you don’t feel respected. Give him the silent treatment… vie for your own strength in life again… and when the time comes just say it simply. “If you want to this too continue you need to show me more attention… I like you but you’re wasting my time.” I mean that’s my advice… lol I haven’t even

176079012,There are two main recurring themes to my dreams; getting lost and being struck dumb. The latter has never actually happened. I can imagine that stress plays a part in people going non-verbal. There are more than a few ways that stress can impact on a person . For me it’s a short period (up to 24 hours) of flu like symptoms and/or de-realisation. Up to the age of about 11-12 I used to stammer/stutter quite a lot. Anxiety and stress were definitely factors.

Some people process information differently and the extra help can make someone with difficulties perform at their proper level. I can get practically every accommodation but never actually signed up for a class…I recommend it for starting out. I went to university so I already proved I can compete at community college. The normies get jealous of those who get extra test time or get to use ADHD meds but I don’t blame them unless they are abusing the rules. Depending on the college you attend, the accommodations can be very hard to follow and do and it’s almost not even worth the damn hassle. They take every measure to fight about cheating and it’s very legitimate and back up by the government. I highly recommend it and most people do. My worries is not about your employer figuring it out (if you don’t tell them, they won’t know), but being able to compete in the work force after college. They say college is easier than wor
k in the sense that the stakes are much higher in the work place and not so cookie-cutter and less room for mistakes. It also depends on the school, major, classes, etc. If you really want to know the truth, go to the disability office and/or call.

I want a stable partner. I rather they have stability and are cool and kind and respectful to me and be able to make love in intimacy n ecstasy but even share a laugh sometimes. If my future partner is vegan that is a plus. There are not many vegan men around though. The few vegan men get treated like rock stars by vegan chics wanting them.ha ha ha I would date a meat eater but want someone with a stable home. Don’t need or want drama like I had with last x that made himself homeless. Was pretty perfect home with x n girls but had to be true to myself and leave to become vegan. I might join a dating site. Don’t know if I should try dating woman. I hav
e been attracted to women but have never had real sex with a woman only once when I was drunk and crawling and she was a prostitute that dominated me and she got paid but I didn’t get paid as I was not a prostitute and I didn’t know till I saw men give her money. I was so drunk and it was easy to dominate me but it was tacky and I was not attracted to her. She was a yucky behaved person. Much worse than me. She was cruel to me. I might join dating site .

176079032,I never really think of things like that I guess. I have always thought the focus should just be to try to be well irregardless. I guess I feel that we shouldn’t have to judge ourselves and just focus on where we want to be in the future. Just my personal take on it.

176079038,Fluanxol at low dose should treat depression and anxiety and at high dose it should treat psychosis like voices and paranoia. While fluanxol is good for depression and the negative symptoms it has a stronger cosine which is called Clopixol. This meds is working better at the positive symptoms than fluanxol like aggression and severe paranoia. I am currently at 500 mg Clopixol every 3 weeks and has been on it the last 24 years. It does it’s job good and I’m very happy that I got it in 1997.

So tell them about your symptoms, hear their suggestions, maybe try an alternative medicine, or if you’ve had enough of swapping and the rigors involved, tell them you’ve had enough, and you’re just going to deal with the problem, and you’re looking for other sorts of therapy to help.

174362114,"I’ve been on roughly the same meds for seven years now without having to be hospitalized. If that doesn’t speak to the power of staying on good meds to control schizophrenia I don’t know what does. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had troubles and had to adjust things, even had a very close call, but I’m still holding strong. It’s even more important for me because I have 2 children to raise. I’ve been through some major life events through all this and am still holding strong. On the other hand a dear friend of mine who tried to control his disorder naturally, and I do mean he was Very dedicated, is doing awful last I heard. He’s squatting on his farmland and armed, and his friends are afraid to visit him or help him because of this. It’s a terrible shame, one of my favorite people in the world because we understood each other and enjoyed one another so much. I hope with all my heart he gets treatment and meds so I can see him again. And before squatting he really destroyed the life he 
had acting out on those he loves. Please consider some treatment of some kind, and if you don’t like the way something makes you feel, talk to your doctor or family about changing it, and be under a doctor’s supervision when you do it. Personally, I hate how I feel when I’m symptomatic, it’s dangerous too. Please take care, I hope something I’ve said will help someone."
176079061,"Sz suck, it made me very irritable and even violent sometimes as a result. I was never a violent person before sz, I was very shy and calm. But now with proper meds stopping positive symptoms and reducing stress to minimum its manageable for me most of the time, which means that I can control my anger and calm it most of the time. Also I got better managing my anger with time and experience. I also find it weird that I have 0 emotions and when I do its only anger and violence. If you still have positive symptoms you might want to try Risperdal or if its not working, Clozapine."
176079062,"Yes i had that too. For me it was mostly in the first week. I have nightmares anyway, but starting zyprexa made this much worse. It got better."

174362119,"I was put on both Invega and Trintellix while in the hospital recently when I got released I had only gotten one dose of each medication and got 3 pills of each to take home with me. I’m having to try and space them out somehow until my follow up with the outpatient people of the hospital. My hope is that they’ll give me just enough to get me to the 31st when I see my psych. Another issue is that the Trintellix needs a prior authorization so I’m not sure how long it’ll be to actually get my medication after seeing my psych. Anyways, has anyone been on Invega? I know everyone is different on how they react to medications. I’m just wanting to know more so if it’s helped anyone. Also, if anyone is on Trintellix please let me know how that’s going as well. I was off meds for a few months again because my Abilify Maintena stopped working. This was the one medication I actually could see a difference on and a few months ago I was taken off it. My psych gave me the option of Trintellix and a
t that point I was just too fed up so I declined. When I went into the hospital though it was a mess so I had mentioned what my psych offered me and basically had them start me on it. The psych in the hospital added on the Invega to help with hallucinations and “peaceful” sleep. So yeah if anyone has any experience with these two medications Invega and Trintellix please let me know."
176079064,I studied music in university. I can compose for whole orchestra. It’s a lot harder than you think.
176079065,"We have the same faith. I also take olanzapine. I think the problem with olanzapine is that it destroys the gaba-system in the body after a while. I took gaba supplement recently and I was able to relax something that resembled how it was before meds. But the problem is that if you try to revive the gaba system you might develop dyskinea. After a few days taking gaba supplement I got involuntary movement in my left hand, so I had to quit, and luckily after a few days the tremors stopped. These meds are like a strait jacket. I’m going to ask my doc about trying trilafon, because it’s not supposed to affect the gaba system. But it only has a half life of about 10 hours, meaning I probably would have to take it in two doses a day, morning and night. And I’m working part time so that might be a problem. Anyway I will post if I get a breakthrough."

176079077,Cause I do. I used to believe I had super powers and could do magic. I used to believe I was the protagonist of this world. I still kinda believe it tbh. But I wish it was real I was a bit sad when I started seeing it as a delusion. Cause this weird belief helped me through some hard times. It helped me feel strong when I had nothing. Idk I guess I’m feeling a bit nostalgic even though it was a really hard and super messed up time in my life. But I guess I’m a bit curious if anyone else feels or has felt this way?
176079078,I have a question to anyone who can answer. If I have at least 1200 calories for the day and I work out and burn 250 calories for that day on the treadmill. Do I minus 250calories from 1200. So that leaves me with 950 calories… which is not enough calories for the day… or do I not count the calories I lose in the work out. So my calories will be 1200 for the day. I am trying to keep my calories low but I dont know if I should be eating more since I am burning 250 calories on the treadmill a day… I am new to this calorie thing and I dont want to eat too little which may cause gall stones I read. I have lost 3 pounds in one week so far.

174362125,"I can miss a couple of days and not tell the difference. But the longest I’ve gone without meds in 20 or 25 years is four days. I started to feel a little weird and a little scared; I felt something coming on. I had run out of meds but when I finally got them and took my normal dose I felt better within a day. That was just about four years ago. I use weekly pill boxes and it was just as scary as when I accidentally doubled up and took my night meds twice. Schizophrenia runs a insidious course so when I began to feel strange, at first I didn’t connect it with taking too much of my meds. Then it started to accelerate and I connected the dots and knew what I had done. I thought I would have to be hospitalized. This was at night but I went to bed early and the next morning I felt OK again."

I am not going to ask my pdoc to extend it when I am not disabled anymore. She probably wouldn’t anyway. I feel completely confident that I can handle full-time, so it’s okay. I have had two interviews in the past three months, but no job offer yet. I ended up being completely overqualified for the first interview, and the second one was an excellent interview but they never followed up with me even though they said they would. That was a disappointment. I hope I can beat my deadline, because I just took almost $7000 out of savings to buy my new-to-me car and I don’t want to dip into it more to live on.

176079144,I am hoping my landscaping goes well and I win more work Now I am in a place where COVID restrictions are at highest level that may just be a pipe dream There is no end to this bullcrap
176079145,Hmm I’ll try it but that was different it was like I had massive hunger pangs out of nowhere. Now I’m hungry because I go such long periods of time without eating. I do this because often my dinners are fatty or unhealthy. So I only have breakfast and then go like 6-7 hours without eating when I get hungry like every 3-4 hours. It’s also really hard to do because when I skip meals and don’t eat I get brain fog and fatigue really bad. I have been trying to be healthier and I now cook at least twice a week so that’s an improvement. I would like to cook more but it takes a while and means that all the time my boyfriend and I have together is spent cooking and eating and cleaning up.
176079146,The question of whether we live in a computer simulation or even a mind is probably closer to theology than a materialist view of reality. The occassionalists in your link would argue that living in a mind would make sense in _PERSON_ view as he argued objects were composed of ideas. So i think discussion of the nature of reality would be dangerous to the simulation as it encourages the thought that the material physics we percieve at this level is only underrstandable as viewing processes but the ultimate mechanics are unknowable making materialist science futile. Dangerous because material science has proven far from futile in understanding the nature of reality.

176079150,"I think there is a confusion between “anyone can succeed” and “everyone can succeed.” The truth is, nobody can predict who will or won’t succeed. It is true that not everyone will get to a level they are happy with, due to a combination of genetics, access to medication, response to medication, self-motivation, access to therapy, and a number of other factors. Of all of those factors, self-motivation is the only one under our control. When the “can do attitude” crowd says that self-motivation saved them, I think this is what they mean. It is impossible to get better WITHOUT self-motivation. They were also saved by responding well to medication, by having social supports, and by having access to good treatment options. But without the ability to believe in their own success and work towards that success, they would never have accomplished anything. And without other role models to look up to, they might never have believed in their ability to recover. So now they are trying to be those 
role models for others. I remember when I first found this place. I’d just been fired from my job, and my doctor told me I would never work again, never get married, and never have a family. When I saw others here who had the things I wanted, it made me believe I could have them, too. And now, I’m married, I’m a parent, I worked up until I quit to focus on parenting, and I have a strong social life. These things wouldn’t have happened if I didnt find the right med, respond well to it, and have access to therapies. But I wouldn’t have spent years searching for the right med, and trying different therapies, if I didn’t see members here in recovery who had the things I wanted, and if I didn’t believe I was capable of achieving the same things."

174362142,"I have never had headaches. I have never had the numbness. These symptoms all started recently like this year. My mom wants to think its diabetes. But I don’t think that is the main issue. My mom was recently diagnosed with diabetes and she is getting better with medicine for this. My mom also has schizophrenia. I don’t think it’s the Aristada because I’ve been on Abilify for 15 years, started the Abilify injection for one year, and then this year Aristada. I worried the vision loss was due to Abilify. But I don’t think anti-psychotics cause tumors do they? Also, my schizophrenia symptoms were never hallucinations. More-so personality/mood and thought disturbances. Doing things repeatedly that made no sense. Inability to communicate/cognitive issues/recklessness and impulsivity. The onset of my schizophrenia was more unusual than others I have read. My mind went completely dark. I got worse and worse. It was like falling into a black hole. couldn’t feel emotions. could not think normall
y. They called it catatonic schizophrenia. Then later I developed paranoia because I did not think it was schizophrenia and fought with the psychiatrists constantly. I only ever had induced hallucinations that went away when being on a different medication. So I may have some type of schizophrenia, but what if it was something else in the beginning or a sign of it that went undetected? It would be good to rule it out to see if this is being caused by medication or something else."

174362163,"Schizophrenia takes a lot of sacrifice, compromises, and means striking a balance. You may have to give up on a high power or lucrative job. Personally, I’ve been working almost 40 years but I will take any job I can get. I was raised with a good work ethnic which means I respect any labor job and any honest job. I really didn’t have any big dreams when I became schizophrenic at age 19. I couldn’t function for about the first two years and really didn’t have any goals. I just went along with the program and my parents were helping me so when they got me in a group home when I was 19 I was depending on them to make decisions for me in regards to my recovery. So after a year at the group home I was psychotic as ever and my parents did the things that they thought were best for me and so I they got me into a long term hospital and I ended up spending 8 months in there at ages 20-21. I got out and 9 months later after a series of small steps I got a job in the community cleaning hot tubs and do
ing maintenance at a popular hot tub facility when those were big in the eighties and early nineties. Stayed there four years while still being pretty mentally ill and addicted to crack and moving around pretty often. Now I’m 59 and looking back on working 40 years at any job I could get. So I’ve washed dishes, been a park ranger, unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, cooked, been a caregiver for my 11 year old nephew( might have been my most difficult job), I’ve recycled and moved furniture and a few others. I’ve been at my current janitor job 7 years. I didn’t need any experience to get those jobs and they didn’t pay much but it was honest work that bought me new CD’s, nice clothes, gas for the car and I’ve usually eaten pretty well. You may have bigger dreams than me and I wouldn’t tell anyone to give up on their dreams but it helps to be realistic. Some people on here have really cool jobs so it’s good to persevere. But like I said, schizophrenia is all about compromise, sacrifice and stri
king a balance between how your illness affects you and your career choice. You might just have to swallow your pride and get a job that is not prestigious. Just something that brings in money but is not too complicated. I mean nobody told me I couldn’t work so that’s just what I do. Those first two years I didn’t function but I got government benefits because I had worked enough to qualify for disability. So I collected benefits for a while without working. When an opportunity came up to work I took it and now I work part time and collect SSDI. IDK, you just got to really weigh your options carefully and maybe not aim too high. Anyways, I wish you good luck and just keep persevering. I’ll leave you with this, having schizophrenia ain’t the end of the world, we still have choices. Just avoid drinking and drugs and take your medication as prescribed and those things will be a huge advantage in your recovery. Take care."

I’ve never felt like I was being cared for or protected or guided by a loving force at the center of the universe. The universe seems to be very apathetic toward people, at best. And all my years studying religion and talking to religious people, I’ve never seen a religion that was anything other than some books, and some buildings, and requests for donations. I try to stay grounded in the here and now, and try to direct my efforts towards improving my own life.

176079322,"There are more supposed delusions/ideas of reference. Another example is the case of words _NAME_ and _PERSON_. These words were last words in names of two men whose bodies/remains were present in Big Hole (_NAME_) and “Dear _NAME_” (Sergeant _PERSON_) special encounters. In these corpses singular items were found: shampoo (in Big Hole encounter) and something with image of black cat (“Dear _NAME_”). In these two encounters there were also rocks (sort of items). Why words _NAME_ and _PERSON_ are coincident? Because they have the same number of letters, the same first letters (K) and the same third letters (n). Words “_NAME_” and “Kong” brought me large coincidence 13.5.2019. About 6 p.m. I thought about these two words and two other words starting with the same letters, having the same first letters and the same third letters - _PERSON_ (I heard music of author with this name some time ago) and kont (genitive plural of Polish “konto” (“account”)). About 9:30 p.m. I saw the w
ord “_PERSON_” in TV (surname of a woman in audition about depression after childbirth), some moments ago the word “_NAME_” was seen (it has only one letter other than the word “_NAME_”, both words have four letters). About 10 p.m. 13.5.2019 I saw word “KONT” on certain forum on which I posted often before seeing that word. Some moments later I typed phrase rozkosz koincydencji epickich (bliss of epic coincidences) in Google and in description of first result I saw word “kona” (Polish verb meaning “he/she/it is dying”), which has the same number of letters as the word “Kong” and three first letters are the same as in “Kong”. I also saw results associated with certain game very similar to that with Big Hole encounter and in third link in results the word “_NAME_” was present! It was very coincident evening. I describe certain coincidence associated with Thabit numbers. Some months ago I found page with the date 2.11.2017, on which there were five points. 2, 11, 5 - Thabit nu
mbers! Some additive prime numbers were bolded in these five points. They were: 23, 11, 797, 10037, 337, _PHONE_NO_, 11171. Most of them have Thabit numbers as sums of digits (only 337 has not, its sum of digits is the sum of 1st and 3rd Thabit number (2+11)) and numbers of digits (only 337 and 797 have three digits, 3 is not a Thabit number). Digits occurring in bolded numbers on certain Internet page are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9. Numbers formed by the same six digits were seen in packaging of biscuits in V 2019, there were such numbers: 01/02/2020 _PHONE_NO_ 01-10. Number _PHONE_NO_ is somewhat coincident with _PHONE_NO_. Both numbers have two “37s” in them, there is also one number 9 in them. Both numbers contain two zeros. These two numbers are similar to each other. In _PHONE_NO_ there is 1 digit 7 and in _PHONE_NO_ there are 3 digits 7. In smaller number there are 2 digits 3, in larger there are 3 digits 3. Number _PHONE_NO_ contains two digits 7 more than _PHONE_NO_ and one digit 3 more than _PHONE_NO_. P
roduct of two digits 7 and one digit 3 is 147. 7 7 3 = 147. 3 7 7 is also prime factorization of 147 and 147 is the product of numbers 21 and 7 (which were very coincident for me) and sum of numbers in geometric sequence 21, 42, 84. It is another “miracle” which happened in my life."

I have enough reason to, my stepdad has threatened violence on multiple family members at different times, he’s a real narcissist. I don’t feel safe living with him anymore. He sends angry threatening e-mails to his parents and my mother. It’s very hard living around an unstable person when you’re schizophrenic yourself. I LOVE that I no longer have to watch the cable news channels he had on all the time. It feels so good to not hear that hate spewing from the television every minute of the day. Biggest improvement from moving, no more cable news. No more having to put on headphones and blast my ears with music just so I wont lose it and smash the television.

176079356,"BTW if you cant get CBD where you live, also in that class of herbs (sedatives) is cedarwood oil. heres a study on it: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The sedative effects and mechanism of action of cedrol inhalation with behavioral pharmacological evaluation. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Planta medica , Jul 2003 It has been reported that cedarwood oil has sedative effects when inhaled. In this study, we evaluated sedative effects of inhaled cedrol, which is a major component of cedarwood oil. Accumulative spontaneous motor activity was significantly decreased in the cedrol-exposed Wistar rats. Similar results were confirmed in caffeine-treated Wistar rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and ddY mice. In addition, exposure to cedrol prolonged pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in Wistar rats. To investigate whether cedrol, which has a very faint aroma, affects the olfactory system, the nasal cavities of Wistar rats were treated with zinc sulfate to reduce olfactory function. Two 
days later, the pentobarbital-induced sleep time was measured as described above. Compared to intact rats, the sleep prolongation effect was decreased in a lavender-_NAME_ chamomile mixed oil exposure positive control group, indicating that olfactory function was impaired. In contrast, prolongation of the sleeping time did not change in the cedrol exposure group. The above findings indicate that cedrol inhalation had marked sedative effects regardless of the animal species or the functional state of the autonomic nerves, suggesting that the mechanism of action is via a pathway other than the olfactory system. lol if youre really tough you could probably get some cedar branches yourself (not juniper!) and boil them into a tea and sip it when you need to relax. dont know how strong is is though so, if i try it i can let you know"

Not in a rush to die, but it’s bound to happen eventually. I think if one can conquer anxiety of death, there’s nothing left to be anxious about. A hard thing to do, but also peaceful in its result. As I see things, I ask myself “What’s the worst that can happen?” No more happiness, but also no more suffering, so in the end, it’s a draw. The real Final Frontier."

174362207,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Polygenic Risk Scores for Psychiatric Disorders Reveal Novel Clues About the Genetics of Disordered Gambling. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies , Oct 2019 14 Disordered gambling (DG) is a rare but serious condition that results in considerable financial and interpersonal harms. Twin studies indicate that DG is heritable but are silent with respect to specific genes or pathways involved. Existing genomewide association studies (GWAS) of DG have been substantially underpowered. Larger GWAS of other psychiatric disorders now permit calculation of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that reflect the aggregated effects of common genetic variants contributing risk for the target condition. The current study investigated whether gambling and DG are associated with PRSs for four psychiatric conditions found to be comorbid with DG in epidemiologic surveys: major depressive disorder (MDD), attention
-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Genotype data and survey responses were analyzed from the Wave IV assessment (conducted in 2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a representative sample of adolescents recruited in 1994-1995 and followed into adulthood. Among participants classified as having European ancestry based on genetic analysis (N = 5215), 78.4% reported ever having gambled, and 1.3% reported lifetime DG. Polygenic risk for BD was associated with decreased odds of lifetime gambling, OR = 0.93 [0.87, 0.99], p = .045, pseudo-R2(%) = .12. The SCZ PRS was associated with increased odds of DG, OR = 1.54 [1.07, 2.21], p = .02, pseudo-R2(%) = .85. Polygenic risk scores for MDD and ADHD were not related to either gambling outcome. Investigating features common to both SCZ and DG might generate valuable clues about the genetically influenced liabilities to DG."

176079393,"It took me 1 to 2 days for the effects to diminish a lot, but still, the remains are need for our logical and sound mind combined with logical reasoning and evidences proving that we did not thought broadcasted. For me, even though I used a webcam and video capture myself for whole 2 mins, and re-view it back by my own, I still can’t convinced myself that I did not thought out loud. the thing is, the video showed no lips moving, no signs of obvious body language that indicates the possibility of me speaking without me knowing. scientifically it is impossible and since I am very normal and can function near to normal humans, that means that my thought broadcasting is false, hence I will tell myself and tries to instill this truth to me. it’s not convincing anymore, it’s more like reprogramming your own mind to the right settings and how it should normally work."

She was very kind and understanding and said that with a doctor’s note she could possibly help me get back into clinicals and that is what happened! I went through a whole roller coaster there though. Immensely stressful. Then I had my first nursing job interview which I do not think went well.

I myself have 4 different diagnoses all explaining my symptoms. Your doctor may change your Dx depending on your symptoms. I find it best to focus on my symptoms. Antipsychotics help with the voices, for many different Dx. Anti depressants help with ennui. Mood stablizers help with the massive swings. And therapy helps with everything. It’s takes time to narrow it down exactly, specially if it’s to be done right. Trust in your meds, and utilize any coping tools. Try to focus on living a good life, not just an illness,"

I looked into suing but there was a lack of enthusiasm from my family although they probably wrote some negative reviews or called someone.

176079440,"I don’t think we have anything against each other now, so I will give you my opinion. And I just mean to be helpful. There’s an old saying that goes something like this, “If nothing changes, then nothing is going to change”. I realize in my own life how difficult it is to make lasting changes. I would change a lot of things about myself and my life if I could. There’s a lot of stuff I would do if I could to change, and I put in a lot effort to change things I don’t like in myself and I try to nudge my life into a positive direction. I know there will be obstacles in anything I do. Certain people would not like to see me do good but I will not give up striving to be a good person and take positive action to make my life better. So I’ve said this to you before and I mean it in a nice way: It’s up to you to change your life. I know you are in a hole because you have isolated so long. I know making changes will be an uphill battle or endeavor. But recovery is not going to come knocking 
on your door. You are not going to magically get better. If I could make you better, I would, and I’m sure other people on here feel the same way. But changing your life is up to you. I don’t want to be rude or insensitive but I told you a couple of years ago that you need to change. It may seem impossible to change and you may have considered it but you didn’t know where to start or maybe you seriously considered it but just procrastinated (personally, one of my biggest faults). But an old saying goes, “The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.” Just think if you had made a few positive changes two years ago. If you had taken just a few positive little steps two years ago you could be reaping what you sowed right now. Your life might be better. All I’m saying is don’t wait for that “perfect” time to make changes. You have to start somewhere so why not now? If you look into the future, in two years time, your life could be either better-- or the same. It’s mostly up to you. The
re’s no time better than now to make a change. You can give yourself a future or just stay the same and in two years you will still be complaining how bad your life is. It’s up to you. I wish you good luck, have a nice morning/night. I’m sure many people on here will support you and share their experience to help you to in anything you do."

174362230,It’s all about function and sounds like your struggling. Self diagnosis is rare but not unheard of. Insight is usually lacking. You sound like you have some issues and what you describe could be a number of things. Antipsychotics are powerful meds and there’s a few out there. First thing would be talk to your psychiatrist. Having one is usually better than a therapist or such. Something is up and a med change could be beneficial. I had problems of poverty of thought and such on risperdal and did and still do so much better on zyprexa. Might be worth a change but there seems to be some underlying issues you need addressing. We aren’t doctors. We’re just peeps on the internet so talking to a shrink is much more beneficial.

He’s very sadistic and very focused on making me suffer he gets enjoyment from tormenting me. Saying this, when he was at its worst on a plane ride home (he tried to get me to open the emergency exits,in flight and wanted me to make the plane crash) I actually laughed at him and compared him to _NAME_. I lold at the time which took enormous strength. _NAME_, he’s an _NAME_ operative who I attributed to my old neighbor who I thought was watching me through cameras. He was very sadistic but rational and intelligent. He’s second in command, but at the same rank of _NAME_.His one focus was to punish me for the insult I said to _NAME_ (leader of the _NAME_ in my town) and to make me insane. His words. _PERSON_, he’s a member of the Provisional _NAME_ and was sent to keep an eye on _NAME_ and _NAME_, to make sure they don’t make me do somethi
ng stupid, he’s a guardian of sorts. He’s a high ranking PIRA commander on the same level as _NAME_ but in the PIRA instead of the _NAME_. But he has a dark side, in the early stages he was very sadistic as well telling me to kill and got enjoyment out of my suffering (when the voices got loud) he’s the one I hear when I get whispers and faint voices nowadays. _NAME_, is the boss of ownie. He’s the head of the PIRA in my town. _PERSON_ answers to _NAME_ but not _NAME_ or _NAME_. He came because I was intimidating ownie by reading his mind (or hearing his thoughts) and _NAME_ was meant there to prove that I couldn’t read minds and to reassure ownie. He was a very old fashioned, kind of reassuring voice which Sounded like he was the boss of the PIRA. Always ensured me it was never too late to start a new life away from all the voices. He actually made a deal with _NAME_ to make him stop sending voices for two days a week. But he also had a dark side, non shelontly telling me to kill myself after I tri
ed but failed to rationalize my way out of hearing voices._NAME_ told me to do this as an experiment by Telling myself it wasn’t possible to hear voices. It actually dulled them a bit."

Thank you And I will do my best, I am medicated very well and don’t really intend to stop it as I feel safer with it being accessible; that being said, I would like to stop using antipsychotics but I don’t see that happening till, like you say, I have the correct environment - academia is stressful."

176079491,Latuda and geodon caused severe weight gain because you have to eat extra calories with them. And they didn’t work particularly will for me. Invega made me super delusional and didn’t help the paranoia or voices. But did help the visual hallucinations a little. Risperidone worked moderately. So I guess that’s the best of them in my experience. But the negatives were really bad with it.

176079500,"I’m literally stuck in PTSD hellhole so I need to vent. I feel like I’ve lost everything to my degenerative disease: my social life, my friends (they’re in Canada), the ability to immigrate and study like a normal student… The only thing I have is my life- the fact that I’m still breathing. To be honest, my life isn’t worth so much. I’m staying in touch with my friends via zoom and discord but honestly it’s nothing close to face-to-face interactions. I’m thinking that people in my country will disregard me because I’m disabled and they’ll bully me for having a disability. Weirdly, Korean kids bullied the ???? out of me in Canada, which is weird considering I am Korean. I arrived as a 12-year-old kid in a Canadian junior high school. I befriended some Canadian girls. Then Korean kids followed me and started verbally abusing me. I cried every day. They disliked my religion and the fact that I had Canadian friends. I went to a Korean church and the adults there disliked me becaus
e they thought I was too devout. The kids at church singled me out because I was clumsy and socially awkward around them. I thought my people would consider me as one of them, but I’ve gotten so much hate from Koreans abroad that I feel like my identity is distorted. I honestly don’t know who I am. Trauma sucks. I’m in my home country and I shouldn’t fear people like this. I’m living in fear every day because I don’t know who will abuse/bully me next. Trauma is literally hell. I don’t want to get hit again. I don’t want to be called names or get bullied. I don’t want to be punished or made to stand in the hallway. I want to feel like a normal person. I want to be valued. I want to stop having flashbacks! I know that I’m an adult now but I fear for my life and my safety. I don’t feel safe. I just want to trust people again, for the love of God. Urgh, trauma is literally hell and I just want to be okay!"

Creative pursuits: engage in some form of creative activity of your choice several days a week. Prayer or meditation: this is a daily essential. Cooking: learn to cook. You just can’t get the same nutrients from fast food , restaurant or convenience foods that you can from well made, home cooked meals. And good nutrition is essential to heal sz/sza. Reading: it not only expands your mind, it is relaxing. Education: undertake to learn something new.

I wash my hair once a week with that sho

Because of my all false beliefs, the negative thinking, the interpretations etc etc… I wasn’t even aware before that my thinking is screwed up. I just ended up by developing all kind of somatic stuff and ended up isolated which is not cool… But whatever… Can we be helped by a more positive thinking? I go out now a bit more, which helps my mood . Its nice to see the day etc etc… I try to ignore my fears etc, but idk if just ignoring will be enough to get rid of them, how do you think? Yes, I take my meds, but I guess my head went just confused, anxious and maybe too much ruminating. I don’t even realize, that I ruminate too much lol… Plus if I ruminate, its all bull**** in my case…"

Something like that happens to you you pretty much have social security’s number in my opinion. It’s best to apply right after you come down with the condition and dont go back to school or work until disability is awarded. Honestly since you have been working full time after your diagnoses it could be harder to win. You may have to prove things have gone down hill since that time. You might want to contact a disability lawyer.

176079616,"_AT_MENTION_ , I’ve been through the racing thoughts too but eventually it passed and my thoughts slowed down. If you give it time there are vey good odds that it will pass for you too. You’re one of the good ones, you’re a good person. Suicide is not the answer. in your state of mine everything is depressing and negative, but that’s just your perception of it, that’s not happening. It’s just how you perceive it. Life isn’t really hopeless, it’s just like if you were wearing sunglasses on a sunny day. Everything looks dark, much like you’re experiencing life now. But take those glasses off and in reality there’s brightness and light. Brightness is real life. And that’s what you got to remember, that feelings are temporary You’re going to feel bad for awhile but eventually those glasses will come off. And life ain’t all bad. As to feeling no joy, I have done a ton of fun things in my life, I’ve had so many great experiences. But while I was doing them I wasn’t always ha
ppy, some of them I wasn’t happy at all, lots of times I had zero feelings of joy. But usually even if I wasn’t happy while going to the beach or comedy clubs or air shows or restaurants I still got something out of them. At the very least going to those places were experiences that when I got home I was happy I went and they make good memories. So don’t pressure yourself into thinking you have to be happy. You can still enjoy life without being happy. I really want to help you, I hope you get something from this. I’ve felt suicidal a thousand times, but a thousand times I am extremely grateful I didn’t do it. I would have missed out on so much."

174362271,"My therapist said this today. He was saying that, due to the long-term trauma I was in, it is rather not normal for me to be sane. If I was pressing all of these emotions for 12-13 years without talking about them to others (and often feeling ashamed of what others had said), it wouldn’t be normal for me to not develop schizophrenia. I.e. it’s not my fault, and anyone who would have been in that situation would be deeply damaged. I was a child. 8 years old. I was abused from 8-12 years. I was bullied the entire time due to my high grades and low social skills. I struggled with maternal relationship with my mother because of her marriage. So I endured a ton. So yes, it’s okay to have schizophrenia and it’s not my fault. I’ve always been ashamed of it. He also told me about this well-known person who is now an expert on schizophrenia/alcoholism. I can’t remember his name, but he said that this person overcame the illness. Despite still having sz, he thrives over it and now he’s an exper
t on sz. Today’s session really awakened me."

Starting to exercise would be enough to get things moving again on its own, so it’s good you’re considering that. I lost my period water weight - I’m down to 224 (95 pounds lost, 44 since starting Zyprexa). I realized a long-time dream today too. I shopped in the regular women’s section at _PERSON_’s! I have not been able to do that since at least 1992, maybe longer. There is such a better selection of cute clothing than just being limited to plus! I literally spent like an hour and a half there picking things out and trying them on. I just went there on Sunday with my mom and found out I am now in a 1X instead of 2X, which was exciting enough. I had $60 _PERSON_’s cash to redeem so I went back today. I decided to try a regular XL and they all fit! Major non-scale victory!!"

176079632,"Also, I cannot blame the mental hospital itself at all. It’s actually pretty good. But the issue was the timelines. They were different and there was an alien agenda behind it I think. Certain things I just don’t want to remember and or talk about. I guess you could say it was a parallel universe or something in a simulation or maybe a different universe or a different computer simulation. I feel like (i’m sure) I’ve been to thousands of different simulations. The aliens told me they don’t exist anymore. They said there are two left and since then, my life has been much better. I think I’ve been to the other simulation, but don’t like it at all. I like this one a lot and my life has been great besides the residual paranoia I’m still having!"

Trying to show willing by socially interacting,as it’s championed as being good for your mental health, has not been anything like successful. Online I see myself as less of an outsider, but only in comparative terms. The best that can be said is that I fit in better in some online places compared to others. This is one of them . I did get some satisfaction in being part of a high IQ group on Facebook , but am going through a ‘it would be very tempting to withdraw from it’ phase .That’s due to a mix of disillusionment, lack of self worth, insecurity and a heavy dose of imposter syndrome… There are several online forums I’ve very significantly reduced my participation on ."

Citric Acid + Baking Soda (this is a cheap alkalizing, anti-inflammatory combo, it’s doing wonders for my arthritis, because low levels of citric acid in the joints are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, since that is what primarily dissolves the uric acid crystals in those joints. There are studies about this) Amyloban 3399 (I’m trying to back away from this due to cost and due to being a fungus, but it really does reduce SZ symptoms. There’s a forum thread about this even, it has helped a half dozen people with their SZ here. I’ve even managed to get a guy on reddit taking it and he’s all happy now, saying he’s had moments when he could

But an old problem surfaced this week. To put it bluntly, I don’t have it in me to have a lot of people like me. I can’t handle a lot of people liking me, I just don’t have the capacity. And even worse, I can’t handle people treating me normal and accepting me. I thought for the last three years that I wanted to be liked, accepted, and maybe occsionally put a little scare in people (everybody else does sometimes, why not me)? When I go to work three days a week, there’s two security guards checking ID’s at the door. Everyone who comes in has to show ID and they take it seriously because it’s an Army Reserve office and we h
ad a bomb threat a couple of years ago. And sometimes they post signs warning people to be especially alert that day due to possible terrorist activity in the building. If you leave during the day and go outside you have to show your ID every time you come back. But I like talking to the guards, it’s cool and they are friendly and kind of joke around with me and I joke back. And today one of them just looked me in the eye and I could tell he thought I was OK and just last week the other guard did the same thing. It freaked me out. And as I went about my day other people were friendly as usual. But the problem really bugs me. I know I’m a little old (58) to be caring if people like me or not but it feels good to be liked. Or I’m too old to get too happy when someone treats me with respect like any other person. But I’m a late bloomer. It’s weird problem, I don’t know if anyone else has the same problem."

176079688,My old friend takes Xanax for social anxiety disorder. He doesn’t get panick attacks while around ppl anymore. Is Xanax not enough for you?
174362297,My goals are to go 5 years without hospitalization. So far I’m at a year and a half! I’d also like to get my positive symptoms under control to the point that I’m not so easily destroyed by minor stress. And I’d like to buy a house.
176079689,"Its tough to do anything with people anymore. I just get so anxious and I feel like I sketch people out. Im fine when you talk to me usually but walking down the street (when busy especially) trips me out This is my main problem now, not any delusions or voices. Its really difficult to live life like this. I also go into work fine but were on rotating shifts going in so I worry abut when we all go in at once I didnt used to be this awkward shell of a person I swear. I still see glimpses of my former self but as I stopped hanging out with people after lockdown I dont anymore and that scares me"

N can even make my body feel things. I knw it could just be an illness but wat if it’s an illness n more. That’s my concern"

It seems like it only exist on that website. Let me ask you this if it truly did work and the Government is trying it’s best to silence the media, don’t you think this product would be pulled off the market? Or many other people would be finding aliens all over the place? I think it is the Air force base."
176079695,"Ive just noticed recently that most of my dialogue in my mind tends to be a voice that I’m not actively in control of. I recognize my stream of thoughts for what they are, but there tends to be more noise from voices than of myself. I’m handling it just fine now a days, but it’s been a long road. Nothing feels off at the moment, I’m happy to be in a relaxed, quiet, neutral state."

I’d been getting support from the age of 21 and now i’m 38 so 17yrs and my pdoc re-diagnosed me couple years ago too, from para/sz to mixed personality disorder. feels like progress _AT_MENTION_ i dont think i had an early intervention team, is it a new service?"

176079702,I have to take Wellbutrin daily for it. It came out of the blue at me some years back. I’m actually doing pretty well overall and have no reasons to be depressed. Think brain chem is wonky.
174362302,I’m on clozapine as well and my ocd is very bad on it. I’m also looking at other antipsychotics. I have tried many but could not tolerate most famous of them. My options are limited
176079703,About theories of sexual dysfunction in SSRI. This theory says that because lower dopamine causes lowered libido
176079704,"It’s kinda sad that it even has to be said. It’s not kind to let people live on the street. It’s cruel, and stupid."
174362296,my pdoc says it’s sz and in the last psych ward they called it psychotic disorder nos. I don’t know for sure. They call it different in several documents so i don’t know which one is right. They changed my diagnosis so often also. I was bipolar first and then it was autism and then later autism and sz… i don’t really care about it anymore tbh =D
176079705,ah that’s really nice =) i think people don’t like me sometimes too… but it’s just a thought that is hard to fight… i’m glad they were nice to you!

176079707,Okay. I just took my Risperidone. I’m getting a little paranoid. My blood sugar A1C has never been above 6.7. That’s what it was when I was diagnosed with diabetes and unmedicated. The goal is for it to be under 7.0. I don’t take insulin. I’m going to hold off the Glucotrol for several days so I can see what side effects of the Risperidone I have.

I think Schizophrenia blows, but I don’t know how I would say…how not worth it is, to take cannabis vrs just taking something like an anxiety medicine, or mood stabilizer if they’re feeling over worked. I want to write to a few companies and government officials about how it really is a bum deal and that schizophrenia is a pretty big money sink as far as productivity lost goes. That way at least there’s like a warning about schizophrenia and what factors could put you at risk."

176079714,I told her when it last came up but not yet this time. I see her on Tuesday
176079715,I don’t remember how it started because I was a little girl. I don’t remember how living without voices is.
174362303,I’ve learned over the years that statistics are one thing but you’ll always find someone who is outside those parameters. It’s a serious disorder and it’s effects are profound. I think most apply to me as well but I try to punch above my weight.
174362307,"Do they cancel each other out? I’m on olanzapine and memantine (_AT_MENTION_) and it helped my positive symptoms but not my cognition and negative symptoms. I also take Nardil, methylfolate, and Lithium, along with high dose B vitamins (Methylpro, if anyone has heard of them)."
176079716,No never. i would need something that would send me back to sleep is that something they do ? pills for night time waking up? not sure if i could take something twice

My mothers friend had a severely brain deformed embryo and she decided to lose it. I guess not all people like this idea but I believe this avoids pain for the embryo and pain for the parents."
176079718,"I’ve done eleven of the 5 days fasts described in the video, once monthly for a year. The food pack is available from www.prolonfast.com but it’s fairly expensive. The effects wouldn’t be visible until the longer term, say 10 years or so, and maybe only then if you persisted with the periodic fasts. I feel fairly young for my age and always have. I’m a bit immature and adolescent emotionally so maybe that’s why. I’d rather be a bit childlike than a hardbitten cynical grown up any day of the week."
176079719,I used to think this was the reason people stared at me and the doctors had hid it from me for me to find out on my own. In 2011 I thought this when I was psychotic. I asked my pdoc if I had Down syndrome but he said No I needed haldol rather.
176079720,I take zyprexa it also helps with anxiety
176079721,"I understand you, both of the issues. If i were to date now, i would want to marry first and even then be scared of sex. And of using some contraception. I would rather chose for more “natural” methods than f.e. the pill. I dont tolerate it well anyway. Not going on the barricades to tell others to not use the pill though…that seems rather radical."
176079722,"Pretty much. Things can get better though. Hopefully they dont get much worse than they have gotten allready. We need to believe we are normal, but thats been hard to do. At least "" normal for us""."

176079725,I’m sorry it would be so expensive for you. I hope you get this all worked out soon
176079726,"I’ve been keeping track of that. For a while it seemed like things I used to do with ease wiped me out, but then I realized it was because I was wearing a mask when I did those things. When I started taking my mask off when I was walking up the stairs to my apartment I didn’t get quite so winded, but I did get winded more than usual."

176079730,"Cats can’t talk, so they probably are used to communicating with body language, and emotions play a large part in that. My old childhood cat used to come sit with me whenever I was crying or hiding in my room for some reason. I miss her a lot."
174362308,"Abilify wired me up, I was only sleeping for 4 hours a night. Lack of sleep ended badly and I had to try something else."
176079731,Can you take stimulants? Like adderall?
176079732,That way I might feel less sedated during the day. Been sleeping every afternoon
176079733,High dose Invega helped mine.
174362310,"When I was on Abilify I was told by my pdr and pharmacist to take it in the morning if its preventing me from sleeping, otherwise, at night. I had the choice. Before quitting my meds I was taking it in the morning. After getting on meds again I was taking it at night. It didn’t matter for me."
176079734,"Well the unimaginable happened. People are gonna say this was an irrational decision and yada yada, but I’ve been having these reoccurring dreams that I was back to working full time on a horse farm. Every morning I wake up disappointed that it’s not my reality. After all I lost my last farm position back July 2018 so it’s been a while. But these dreams have been plaguing me and my every thought so I decided I would start looking for a horse farm job again. I did not expect things to happen this suddenly, but they did! I interviewed for the position tonight and she said I could have the job if I wanted it. With one catch, she’s not going to hold the position for me. I have to move down there in two weeks. The compensation is quite good for the line of work it is, $1200 a month plus room and board included. Many positions like this don’t pay anything and they only give you your room and board so this is actually doable. I’m young and single, I feel as though I should scoop up this opport
unity with open arms and take the plunge. I have until tomorrow to decide."

176079783,"Intuitive eating is about trusting your inner body wisdom to make choices around food that feel good in your body, without judgment and without influence from diet culture. We are all born with the skill to eat, to stop when we are full, to eat when we are hungry and to eat satisfying foods. As we grow up that can change for a variety of reasons. Many of us lose that freedom and intuitive eating is learning to reclaim it. When we filter out the noise and influence that diet culture presents to us as false truths, we can then truly listen to what our body wants and needs from food. If you want to try it, thinking if it was a trigger or not can help."

Another time I was bringing in the groceries, and noticed that some flowers had blown off the deck railing. I took the groceries inside, came out and the flowers were sitting back on the railing.

I’m curious to see what the new supplement does. I’ve read it helps with energy, aging, and the brain cells and body cells, and with skin. It’s good to always look for possibilities and alternatives.

like i’m gonna be punished for getting a raise. i feel like they should just say i’m fortunate to be making a little on the higher side, and view my work as if i was making like 12 bucks an hour given that’s the national average for delis. i know _AT_MENTION_ makes more than i do, but he’s also on the older side and has been disabled his whole life. they’re more lenient with older beneficiaries. i’m only 38 and i’ve only been diagnosed the last ten years. i’ve been at my job for four years."
176079887,I do pump once a week. I had two boyfriends that were body builders. One was huge but he was on steroids. I was obsessed with him. He looked like a model from a body building magazine.

I would love to be a body builder if I was more disciplined. I went to the gym five days a week and did two hours at gym but was still fat because I ate a lot and was on medication. Now I exercise less and it’s a struggle to do the little I do. Good wishes to you.

174362356,"I came off medication twice and had to go back to the local psychiatric ward after my sleep was disrupted. Because once I came off Haldol, everything was going fine for 4 months and then I had a relapse. Part of the problem is that these medications change our brain chemistry so much that surviving without them becomes difficult. I felt much better when I came off, but later my sleep was disrupted and historically this is always the first trigger that something isn’t right as far as my mental health is concerned. I later learnt that Abilify doesn’t block dopamine receptors in quite the same way, yet I was unable to adapt to using Abilify with my sleep being disrupted and then lead to another relapse on that particular drug. If I were able to come off the medication and not have my sleep disrupted then I would do so immediately, but I have pressure from my family to stay on the medication and to be honest, I don’t blame them, I think it makes sense for the time being. I just don’t like the f
act that because of Covid-19 none of us have been able to see psychiatrists. I now take Clopixol 400mg per 2 weeks."

This is linked to the classic motivational principle that people approach pleasure and avoid pain, and is gained from acting on certain behaviors that resulted from esthetic and emotional feelings such as: love, hate, fear, joy, etc. According to the hedonic principle, our emotional experience can be thought of as a gauge that ranges from ba Histo..."

I wouldn’t wanna work at the pizzeria full time cuz that’s a lot of miles to put on a car. Maybe in retail. I have a specific field in mind too. But I told him I think I’d be capable when my work trial period is over but I’d see when the time comes for sure . He said that I should play it by ear really and in May if I really feel capable of working full time then I can try it. I mean the Ssdi money is nice and everything but I think I can earn even more money eventually if I become a full time worker. And work my way up in the world. Who knows. I just feel capable with the meds I’m on now. I learn from my mistakes rather then dwell on them. Is a difference I notice on my meds vs not on them.

176079948,"I’ve had a lot of people compliment me over the years with words like “unique” “special” “different”. Most of the time the words cut deep because I’ve always just wanted to belong. Be “normal” like everyone else. I’m getting used to it now, and embracing my differences."

When I moved in my step-mom gave me a few boxes of miscellaneous stuff for the kitchen. Not “top of the line” but good enough. She also gave me a hundred dollars to buy necessities. I thought that was a lot. I don’t get up in the morning and think, “Wow, I wish I had a newer couch or better pots to cook breakfast in.” I don’t get depressed because I don’t have new stuff, I have what I need and just enough luxuries. Human beings are remarkably adaptable and I am used to my surroundings. I paid off a 6 thousand dollar credit card debt just last year. All the things I bought to put on that card were not worth the despair of getting that monthly bill and knowing I would probably be in debt for years and years."

174362371,My Uncle and his Aunt had it. My brothers don’t have it and my Mother didn’t. My father is a subjective case. When he smoked weed one time he had 2 voices in his head for a while but they went away when he stopped smoking it. I don’t know how long they lasted but he evidently struggled in his mind as to why they had existed for possibly years. He’s gone now so I can’t quiz him further. My relatives on his side say there is no more of it in the family (my schizophrenic Uncle is deceased as well) but I feel they are hiding something.

I just worry about my long term job prospects… Guess I’ll have to do like _AT_MENTION_ says and just keep on keeping on."
176079958,Much peace friend. My cousin lost her husband in Afghanistan. He was a sapper/engineer and was a demolitions detector and animal handler. It was the first time we lost a man and his dog. So sad and impacted hard on her family for sure. I went to the funeral and it was attended by our Prime Minister at the time which shows you how big it was. Every soldier deserves the respect of the nation and hope they look out for their family too. Much respect.

But I’d rather be the guy who comes in at night when everyone’s gone and clean up the place and not have to socialize with anyone I’m not gonna be picky but I feel the more independent in my job the better. I’d rather few co workers and no “customers” But I find cleaning therapeutic. My favorite part at my old job was sweeping and mopping. And it wasn’t just because it was when we got to go home.

That said, employers I know aren’t legally “allowed” to not hire someone based on their MH issues, but its problematic. There’s no clear line between someone’s persona and someone’s MH issues. And likewise for the employer someone’s MH issues ARE going to affect their work ability."

Mind you, most people with schizotypal disorder or traits, don’t go on to develop schizophrenia. Stress is probably the key, and the first thing you need to address. Obssesive rumination certainly doesn’t help, but then again there is a strong correlation between artists and schizotypal disorder. It’s not a crippling condition and it can be managed.

The dog could be friendly but he was just unstable enough that sometimes he wouldn’t let me near him and anytime he deigned to be friendly and let me pet him he was just dangerous enough that I couldn’t fully relax or trust him. One evening I was out back where he was kept and I started to feel sick and I knew I wouldn’t make it to the bathroom so I walked to the side of the house and vomited. A lot. For awhile. After no more came out I went inside for some rags to clean the mess because I couldn’t just leave it there. I came back outside and the damn dog was licking and eating the mess! It was so gross, it almost made me throw up again. I tried to shoo him away but he wouldn’t budge. I tried to push him and he growled very menacingly. I didn’t push the issue.

No aliens, just dinosaurs down below rofl. Nobody deserves this. Buddhism seems appealing sometimes like non-existence, nirvana, or ‘estinguish-ment’ or w/e it’s called. Sort of like not existing or being born ever. Even had thoughts I was a ‘super solider’ and mk-ultra-monarch victim. No peace sometimes. Universe seems to ‘come back’ or ‘bounce back’ or ‘repeat itself’ in a self-similar manner for eternity. Sort of like simulation theory and time travel and the whole 9 yards and crap. I cannot remember my life since 2011 like I just woke up or gained sentience that year. Was it a microchip + electronics (signal)? I felt like my mind ca
me from the satellite or radio towers like my soul/consciousness + outer space. _PERSON_ talks about this. It’s 100+ year technology.

Maybe those aliens weren’t real and it’s all smoke and magic and mirrors lol. Like maybe _NAME_ was right…that they’re just earth robots or machines made in a laboratory done by experiments to ???? with people. Scary right? Evil Illuminati people doing it to me and others. Maybe aliens don’t exist and if they do they follow the ‘non-interaction/interaction’ principle from Star Trek or something… Then who runs the simulation? Our descendants or future humans?

So basically it all boils down to extreme trauma, mind control, and psychosis from mk-ultra monarch pretty much according to _PERSON_’s _PERSON_ and simplifying things lol. Nothing beyond a little ‘hand-waving’, ‘smoke and mirrors’, and technology. No need for spiritualism or satanism. Just a bunch of frauds. I still believe in God. Maybe the whole “I’m a time traveler or alien” isn’t real and it’s just animal dna like I’m a human-animal hybrid or some genetic creature born and created down in a lab like a 
test tube. That’s getting pretty crazy and far-out there. Damn, _NAME_ is pretty smart guy. Mars wasn’t even real. – I know I sound like I made a 180 in my recovery and am singing a different tune, but it feels more logical, clean, simple, and Occam’s razor type stuff. I went missing in college for some time…not much. Mom originally thought 1 day but then recalled 3 days but doesn’t know. I think my mom and family could be clones or chip-heads too…I remember some stuff happening but then it’s all gone and just a ‘blur’. Those ‘alien ufos’ I’ve been seeing are just human terrestrial craft. No magic or alien ????. – This post might be triggering to some. Feel free to flag or delete it if it bothers you. I feel like I’m making progress off the drinks."

176080029,"I was on Invega and I took prednisone for poison oak, not knowing it would trigger a psychotic episode. I ended up in the hospital."
176080030,Yes that’s the way they describe it. I haven’t ever tried it but it’s worth a shot because cheese is important I eat dairy or otherwise I’d be getting me some of that too

176080039,I am strangely satisfied i know there is nothing more i could have done. I ran out of money the last day of the last pay. I am building a buffer this pay not spending much. I shouldn’t need any more clothes this pay i expect to be left with $300.

174362384,As long as we are progressing and giving up then we have reason to feel guilty for creating a burden on others. Humans are made to rely on each other. It teaches us compassion and gratitude. The world will one day turn around so that those who were a burden become a huge asset. Have faith
174362386,"I have been studying for a course for many years and didn’t try to get a relationship. I never thought I couldn’t get a girlfriend. I just wasn’t trying to. Now my course has finished and in a discussion on here I was called incel (not true). After my last thread was deleted a few weeks ago, I decided the answer for me was to get a girlfriend and prove I could do it. So I went on a dating app and found a lady. Even though it’s lockdown and we can’t yet meet, we chat constantly on Whatsapp all day, we send each other lots of video messages and we video call. We love each other. She is pretty enough for me to be able to give her a relationship, as she would need to be. It is very strange for me to be in a relationship and I have to say that some aspects of this situation are very shocking. She bases her expectations of me on her previous boyfriends. When she found out about my diagnosis she ditched me at first then changed her mind and we got back together. Her last boyfriend was extremely 
violent and controlling. As soon as she told me, I immediately asked if he had any female friends. As expected, she said no – he didn’t have any friends at all. I explained that if a woman goes out with a man who doesn’t have female friends, he will definitely be extremely violent and controlling. I know what men are like. She told me not to confront him because he will win any fight. He didn’t want her to have any friends, he took her phone more than once (all standard behaviour for men with no female friends). So now I am dealing with this individual with extreme paranoid beliefs about women’s freedom. I don’t have any paranoid beliefs myself. He is exactly the same as my social worker who is way too paranoid to have had any female friends in his life. My psychiatrist wouldn’t be allowed by her husband to mix with male friends. I have to suffer as a result. The paranoid delusions in my life are not mine but my social worker’s beliefs. I allow (and encourage) my girlfriend to have male friend
s. I speak out against oppressive relationships. He deeply feels the need to control me and stop me speaking. I realise now that it’s my liberal views on women that cause my situation with the health service. I know from my girlfriend that all the women on here would need permission from their boyfriends and husbands to speak to me, which their partner won’t give. The only women to answer this thread will be single. I say to you women on here that you should all be free to have male friends and my diagnosis of schizophrenia (as if I am paranoid) is meant to stop me from establishing it on here. I will get my girlfriend to come to an appointment with the psychiatrist and that will solve it."
176080041,Sorry thanks for the reply though
176080042,Sorry you are going through this. Is there anybody else you can live with?
176080043,"These are not valid, you are just different,"
176080044,"I think this is massively influenced by previous trauma, or how the history of treatment of a person has developed over time. It’s hard to think or expect positive messages, when people tell you for a prolonged period of time that you’re worthless."
176080045,"it’s so good to be understood, thanks. i am also good at planning everhopeful but lately i don’t do everything i set out to. _NAME_"
174362395,"For me, it hasn’t affected my personality. Maybe dimmed my outlook on life, but not my personality. But I have a personality disorder (Schizoid) of which there is overlap. Hard to explain it to others. You kind of have to be in my head."
176080046,So everyone has Schizophrenia but get categorized further as Schizoaffective depending on mood.
174362393,"The only thing they go by is did you have positive symptoms for the last six months. Yup your schizophrenic, even a toddler could diagnose schizophrenia."
176080047,what meds are u on now?
176080048,None friends. None anymore. But better off with none at the moment than the one who kept pestering me to go holidays with her.
176080049,Did you know why they wanted to hurt you? Did you feel like this every time/every where you went? Was there a relief of paranoia during some days? What mild paranoia do you have now?
176080050,True _AT_MENTION_ . I’m going for a car ride with hubby and my stepdaughter.
176080051,If you chain smoke then it’s a good idea to switch to vaping.
176080052,Language is so imperfect to use to communicate from one person to another. We do the best we can.

174362391,"I’m not blaming the movies/shows I watched at an influential age for my schizophrenia, I’m just saying they definitely had an impact on the direction it took. What programs made a difference in your illness?"
176080055,Good. I tried Invega but didn’t work for me
176080056,Understood! The Cringe-O-Meter is off the charts with this video!
174362394,I agree 100% with that.
174362389,"Depends on the profession. My damaged back ended my career as a chef, but it’s not a hindrance to being an insurance broker."
174362398,My positive symptoms are somewhat better but my cognitive symptoms are way worse.
176080057,“Evil” has too much religious connotation for my liking. I prefer to just call people a55holes.

176080060,"Hi! To find out what I can do, say _AT_MENTION_ display help ."
176080061,Meds are not poison. Maybe its your delusion? You should get back on your meds before it gets worse. Also encouraging others to stop meds is against the forum rules.
176080062,That’s tough _AT_MENTION_. I’m sorry people judged you unfairly
176080063,That is awesome. Good for you.
176080064,Why what? Fifteen
176080065,_AT_MENTION_ consider yourself a success that you aren’t going into debt. That’s amazing in itself.
176080066,Hope it works out. I really need to start thinking about quitting it too…my vaping habit is far worse than cigarettes ever were.
176080067,Finding the right stable med and dosage is the biggest part in becoming stable. It took me 9 years to find a stable med after trying 4 different antipsychotics. I tried antidepressants but they only made me more sleepy.
176080068,This is highly unusual what i experienced and i had an unusual feeling about this guy. I think somebody put him to make me go mad
176080069,Hey guys my cognitive abilities seem to constineously be going down since the beginning of last year I mostly experience episodes where I might in my head continue a thought like it was actually happening like my dog was going after a squirrel the other day and today I was rethinking it and after I was like no _NAME_ don’t go after it I find I make a lot of errors by saying nice after something that isn’t “nice” and recently I’ve also been forgetting what I was thinking about mid thought can this be related to my hyonchondriasis I will add that sadly I’m in anxious mode all the time because if it and my big fear of dying
176080070,I’m 32 years old.
176080071,Sounds like fun lol.
176080072,why wouldnt they allow me to try it again? im not getting any side effects is just that it literally didnt get rid of my paranoia at all
176080073,"There’s no user under that name.I suggest that if you already want to be advocate,You post his user name so I can see his posts!"

176080074,Yeah… did the second one over a week ago. I’m thinking about getting it…
176080075,"You don’t have to wholeheartedly believe a delusion for it to affect your life. For example, at my sickest, I had the delusion that I was a demon who sucked the life and joy out of others. Now, I knew in my head that this was absolutely insane, and I was a full human being. But it didn’t stop the belief from feeling real. And it didn’t stop me from making some very bad decisions based on that belief."
176080076,how did they steal the horses.

176080086,ever get jealous?
176080087,Well done matey. Never easy talking in front of a crowd and sounds like you killed it. Congrats on a good day!
176080088,Would it have an immediately sense changing effect? Drs tend to say they build effect over time. Could be placebo and that it wasn’t immediate but a combination of sz and then also the dopamine inhibitor has a partial effect as well?
174362396,Risperdal 4mg. Only Abilify improved negative symptoms but caused addiction and hypersexuality side effects. I am waiting on Vraylar to be available here.
176080089,"it depends if I get life threatening illness with little time to live, then I might leave and go try to see all the sites in the nation. thanks for your reply, Iowa is a swing state, I’m not very Liberal, just Liberal."
176080090,"It’s a strange world for sure. I’m pretty sure it’s not going to go away in a hurry so there’s a lot of pain to go through still. I tend to think that the modern world is a place of isolation anyways even for those who don’t have mental disorders. It lends itself to isolation and depression for sure with it’s cities and culture. It’s not bad to be a non conformist these days which is nice and slowly, thanks to some awesome people, we are fighting the ism’s that affect people negatively. I like the title of your post for sure…I think we’ll see that for a couple of years yet."

174362397,I was on haldol i had real low energy and eventually it began to go into depression and then hallucinations. She eventually took me off the med and put me on abilify. Its working pretty well
174362409,4 months on abilify.
174362413,Anyone out there experiencing _NAME_ on Saphris? Or not experiencing _NAME_ on Saphris? I’d like to hear some more experiences please.
176080099,Its very well made for cellphones too unlike others.
176080100,"I take a supplement known as “Daily Essential Nutrients” by _NAME_ Nutritionals. Few months ago cut the dose to 1/3rd to save costs. I used to be very dependent on it, but now I’m okay. Also taking D3 like 160k IU, Vitamin K2, and sometimes beta glucan (water-soluble fiber.) And negatively-charged _NAME_ water. Stabilizes my blood sugar.

I don’t tend to believe in simulation theory, but have never been interested in it either. so don’t know much about it. anyways have a good one, I hope you stay. I like your posts, they bring color to the forum."
176080104,"so after my relapse this last month, and the descent into a crisis, I started taking 400mg amisulpride (my therapeutic dose) instead of 200mg (my maintenance dose). And now two or three days later, I woke up and had hope. Now I am back in action, and doing things again. It’s awesome what this med can do for me. And its been like that every time I raised it to 400mg. I take 200mg when i am well, as the med is so expensive, but when i relapse i find 400mg brings be back out of the horrible dreamlike state i was in. I was almost heading for the hospital again, but amisulpride saved the day! Yay! Thanks to all who supported me thru my crisis, I really appreciate it!"
176080105,Now searching that in google instead of just Ireland shows it as a country with its flag.
174362407,Well there are several personality disorders associated with schizophrenia. I guess they just don’t diagnosis them as much.

176080107,My wife is at her parents this week. She left me a honey-do list. I’m kinda wishing it would grow wings and fly away.
176080108,"Executive function determines the overall quality of live, productivity etc and not IQ. IQ is used for solving complex puzzles but for day to day activities executive function helps. Executive function contains various cognitive parts mainly what useful include planning to plan everything and for execute need working memory and attention."
174362401,"I have been on risperidone for 5 months and I can barely get out of bed. I just want to sleep all day and not do anything. Also, I get akathisia so it’s a never-ending cycle of getting up and pacing around and going back to bed. I’ve also lost interest in most things and have a lack of motivation. I don’t experience the ups and downs like I used to and feel like I have little emotion. I started a new job recently but had to take leave because I just couldn’t get any satisfaction from my job and made me exhausted and tired. My sex drive is basically gone. I’m not sure if I’m depressed or it’s because of the risperidone. Anyone else has similar experiences?"
176080109,I haven’t had an orgasm in 6 years. The last time I did it was with my gf who is now my wife. I haven’t masturbated in like forever. Risperdal _PERSON_ is at fault.
176080110,Sometimes yes my mind is captive by Alien when he tries to control it Or by my phobias or anxiety
174362405,The diagnostic rate for scizoaffective is about .3 percent of the population where schizophrenia is about 1 percent. So they are both very rare. But the figures for schizophrenia are over twice as many.
176080111,4pm to midnight. This way I get the peace of Nighttime with still getting most of the regular day
176080112,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I was at the dermatologist today and she stuck a needle in the bump to numb me up and then scraped off part of it to send to Stanford to see what it is and to see if any further treatment is necessary. I have to go back in a week to get the results from Stanford to see if it could be cancer.
176080113,Good luck!!! 15
176080114,I have the same problem
176080115,"I’ve drank a LOT of coffee for forty-five years. In the beginning I would drift through the morning in a pleasant reverie, and then be deeply depressed in the evening. I’ve drank so much of it now that it has little effect. I don’t know what would happen if I went off the coffee cold turkey."
174362416,No one in my family has it
176080116,I have managed to go down a notch in my belt but still have a lockdown belly
174362410,"Good one EH. Personally, I had voices before ever touching the drugs. I used the drugs to cope. But that being said. I whole heartedly believe that drug use can be the trigger for diseases like this. It certainly didn’t help my case, regardless of what I believed when doing them. We all have our own triggers, drug use is one of them in my opinion"
176080117,I wish when I had my suicide attempt they would have kept me there off meds or on a low dose and tapered me off hmmm 6 months wouldn’t bother me but They gave me meds right away and let me out and I went off them and didn’t go to doctors appoints and stuff I might have been better off if they never prescribed meds who knows
176080118,Maybe call your local school and raise the Volunteer Hours idea with the Principal? Tell them we do it in Canada…it might just catch on in your area!
176080119,"What do y’all do about homicidal ideations? I get these thoughts of rage within me that I can’t help. I try to hold all of it in and I fear one day I’ll lose it. Like something will set me off and I’ll do it. Not to my children, husband or other family members, but my in laws brothers in laws, sister in law. Who I hate with a passion. I’ve always thought of myself as amoral, and have had no restraint to hurt others. Especially if these people have ever crossed me. I know writing this and looking for help about said actions has put me under FBI watch, they do read what you search. Anyway, how can I stop feeling this way? Note, I’ve been playing with these thoughts since I was a child. I don’t want to go to the hospital, but I may have to. I’ve read that everyone at some point have had murderous thoughts and it’s even been encouraged to allow thoughts to play out to get them off your mind. At least that’s what I’ve read. I really need advice. I keep thinking of what I would have 
to lose and the consequences. I think of the snowball effect. The sh@# trouble I’d be doing to my family."
176080120,My life isn’t normal given that I can’t use a lot of the things normal people do. I can’t use stairs and not all places have elevators. But my antipsychotics help me to stay motivated and to actually enjoy things. I wish I can use stairs though.
176080121,"Yes, it’s having a positive effect. I have been on 30mg before, which carried too many side effects. I tried to explain to my old therapist, it’s like I’m bilingual. I have a lot of words that don’t get shared. Theres stuff going on, but I know people don’t agree."
176080122,"Because every time I walk up to a beautiful girl in a grocery store and say, “I find you attractive and I want to have sex with you in the dairy section”, in my experience, she will say “no” and give me a funny look."
176080123,I agree. Sounds a positive move and as you say you already have some skills. Plenty of time to think about it.
174362402,"I thought I didn’t have voices because for the longest time I experienced them as loud “intrusive” thoughts. I thought I had severe OCD, not schizophrenia. So when I started hearing them outside of my head, it threw me for a loop. I thought it was odd that it just happened all of a sudden because as far as I know, OCD doesn’t develop into psychosis. It resulted in a delusion that I had entities in my head and that they were escaping. But anyway, just be careful because you may still have voices even if they seem like there coming from inside your head. If they’re talking to each other or about you then those are voices."
176080124,"Judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, judge a llama for not thriving in the desert, judge the mentally handicapped against an ivory tower of supposed accomplishments. No, it’s not fair, but they do it anyway. This world isn’t fair, but we can be, specially with ourselves. Keep up the good fight EH. Good one."
176080125,"cool do you know how many gsm it is? that is the thickness of the paper. for watercolour painting you want to be using at least 300gsm really. but less is ok too, but the paper might curl a bit."
176080126,Love browsing the forum
174362422,Best of my British Luck to anyone that gets a date after disclosing their Schizophrenia lol. Ive scared way too many women off in the past by bringing it up too early. Good job im comfortable in my own skin now on me own lol.
176080127,"Yeah, it has been going on a long time to just be stress. If you want to test it before you get a chance to see your doctor, you can ask them if you are allowed to take Benadryl. Benadryl can treat _PERSON_, so if the eye twitching gets better afterwards, it could be a clue."
176080128,I’ve read it’s a form of “self medication”. It helps spatial awareness or something. But certainly We’d be better without the poison!
176080129,"I look and act normal. But when I type, open my mouth, I think people think I’m crazy. I’m sure of it. I think my parents think I’m nuts. I don’t have any friends because of low self-esteem and because I don’t want any anymore. I’m happy being me."
174362408,"I’m on Risperdal Consta and because of it I have no sex drive and I’m not orgasmic but it doesn’t matter because the Church doesn’t allow my wife and I to have sex anyway. In addition, my wife is on Abilify and she says she doesn’t want sex either."
176080130,Yeah
176080131,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! I will try this.
176080132,I have enough trouble coping with one of me.

176080134,"I mean, if you were really noticing others, you would know where you stand."
174362414,Does your schizophrenia worsen agoraphobia? Do you also have psychotic symptoms when anxiety attacks?
176080135,You’re projecting. A good majority of people aren’t like that.
176080136,"Thanks, I was suicidal at the beginning of my sz then I stopped as it made my parents cry."
176080137,I don’t think I’ve ever had a meeting with a psychiatrist go longer than five minutes. It’s just always been some quick questions then I’m out the door or they’re out the door if one of my psychiatrists comes over.
176080138,Why every 2 years? I see mine every month.
176080139,I am a bit like this too and it can be a paranoia also.
176080140,"I used to have “self talk” but now my mind is completely blank . When I was first hospitalized the doctor asked me if I heard voices and I said no. But then he asked me if I have conversations in my head. I replied “yes, but everybody does”. And now hey presto I don’t. It would make for a good poll though. I.e. who does this and who doesn’t."
176080141,Welcome back _AT_MENTION_ . Hope you will show us new possum pictures… !

176080143,Could you apply for your sister to get a case worker or call a crisis intervention team?
176080144,It will take 20 years at most by slowly increasing the dose but it will get you off your meds
176080145,"I won’t get it. My country is slow anyway, and i have no reason to be offered a vaccin early, so i too don’t have a chance to get vaccinated for a very long time. But i do not trust the vaccin and i am not scared to get covid. So i will refuse."
176080146,I have a mmj card and still lose weight…I think if you would try smaller plates and only allow yourself two trips to the food you could do it without giving up cannabis…
176080147,Wow. Yer daughter sounds really childish… Is she a always so selfish and demanding?
176080148,"I smoked for many years, now I vape. It helps with anxiety."
176080149,Do you feel like you can keep working now?
176080150,"Hmm. You Say…, I Say, Psychopath’s Are Perhaps Trapped In Corners Of A Reality Upon Such Severe Judgment, That The Only Way They Truly Think They Can Escape That Sort Of Madness, Is To Do What The Civilization Said They Have Done Before Anything Has Actually Happened. Which Means What Exactly?. Be Careful What You Wish For, Perhaps?. Maybe On Both Ends In The Long Run. Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged As The Olde Spiritual Saying Goes.

176080152,Yes when I went off my meds or reduced dose too much I started hearing voices again and getting violent thoughts inserted by _PERSON_ in my head and he tried to take control of my mind. Did get withdrawal symptoms too - tension and anxiety I guess it was both
176080153,"hopefully you don’t have those awful thoughts in mind, I hope youre doing well, if you have awful thoughts in mind get yourself checked in to a psych hospital"
176080154,this is what your doing to your heart. The muscle grows inward limiting the blood amount being pumped through and through and the hypoxia and ischemia cause the cycle to worsen until you finally have a heart attack and die 20-30 years earlier
176080155,What? It hasn’t even been invited yet. But I could light you up early if you want to volunteer.
176080156,Yes i use music and headphones now. Helps with voices. you?
174362420,It’s such a relief to see so many others with this same belief. I have struggled with it ever since my first episode. Sure it was hysteria. I still think I’m making it up. But the negative symptoms are obviously real. Plus reading here makes me realize lots of my symptoms are pretty typical.
176080157,"Well, I’m a raging heterosexual but I strongly doubt that there is some gay mafia out there trying to get me"
176080158,I’m so glad this is the outcome. Seeing pdoc weekly is good until your ease with threatening violence is lessened significantly. Good job on being honest with your pdoc. That takes character
176080159,I have serious poverty of thought.
176080160,"Hey there, welcome back. I do think you use a very high amount of meds, though i cant judge whether you could do with less. I can imagine your wish to withdraw. Here you can always ask for a second opinion… dont do anything as stupid as i did before though, like going too fast or secretly withdrawing without telling anybody."
176080161,"I don’t know you, you’re young its a moody time to be a person I think it could happen, just try to stay calm. If you have a delusion or something you think might be one, come talk it out on here and we can see if we can poke holes in it, and maybe take away some of the emotional power they tend to have."
174362428,"My psychiatrist knows me more than you. I tried for over 9 years and many are like me on this forum. I can start naming them. My psychiatrist wrote on my diagnosis: Schizophrenia with negative symptoms, apathy and avolition. He said there is no meds for these and started educating me about SZ history and how not all SZs suffer from negative symptoms. My psy said Abilify is best for negative symptoms. I was better on Abilify, bath everyday, social, hang out with friends etc but I developed addictions from Abilify, over 2600 lawsuit against Abilify: Drugwatch.com Abilify Lawsuit | Settlement Amounts & Injury Claims Abilify has been a subject of lawsuits linked to compulsive behavior like gambling, binge eating and hypersexuality.

174362417,Interested since I lay on bed quite a lot. _AT_MENTION_ what do you think about zinc for negatives? Somewhere I read that lions mane has zinc in it.
176080170,it’s a great thing to have _NAME_ and makes our life more meaningful and fulfilling. _NAME_
176080171,Switching gears and water temperature are for sure one of the many things that are challenging. I think overall there’s so many steps involved that it makes it all the more difficult.
176080172,I dont have sex drive on paroxetine since years and to be honest _USER_ID_. Mental health is more important to me than having sex.
176080173,"People in their 20s are at times inexperienced, naïve, bold, foolish and the what not."
176080174,I’d only agree to that if the new drugs worked on the illness. Weight gain is bad but psychosis is worse.
176080175,Physically my vision gets blurry and I generally feel unwell but what _AT_MENTION_ said was on point for the other signs. I try to sleep it off. If it’s close to dark take your meds and go to bed early.
176080176,"I wanted to try Vraylar but my psy said its not available in Canada. I wasn’t stable on Abilify. Abilify made me hypersexual, compulsive shop, addicted to weed and binge eat. There is more than 2600 lawsuits vs Abilify about those side effects. I am now on Risperdal and it works great, no side effects."
176080177,"People’s opinions about psychosis bug me, of course. But they pale in comparison to people’s opinions of my homosexuality, so I don’t get very offended by them. Remember that they’re just annoyingly uneducated, not hateful. And that can easily change for the better once they get to know you."

If medication helps you function so you can do the things you want and can, then that isn’t so bad. Why struggle in life if you don’t have to? I’ll take a pill over having a terrible life any day."
176080182,Stress is a big leveler for mental health. It increases symptoms of sz for sure as well as other disorders. Having strategies to deal with that helps too. Things like exercise and eating well certainly can help.
176080183,"I like the middle one the most. They’re all cool, though."
176080184,Unfortunately I can’t touch the stuff. Makes me so paranoid. Never really had visuals on it but I know it can amplify the voices so can easily see visuals getting worse

176080197,"When I feel like this, it seems I never win and everything looks like crap. The reality is I win enough. I’m pouting about the drive over here to the park, it was frustrating, I got a little agitated. And it seems everybody was winning but me and that I always lose. But it ain’t true. I lose a lot but not all the time. I know someone’s going to say, “Well, it ain’t all about winning”. Well sure, you’re right, but sometimes it is."
176080198,I am full of conspiracy theories. I think it’s normal for us. You can’t let it stop you from living though. I don’t think medication helps with that. For me it has just gotten better with time. How long have you been sick?

Thing about ellipse is that it’s very mild on your knees and leggings compared to jogging, this is particulary useful to people who are overweight. The machine I bought has a maximun capacity of 110kgs bodyweight, but I suppose it’s possible to get machines that has a higher threshold although they might be more expensive. Anyways it’s worth it. A membership to gym costs more for one year than the ellipse machine did. I find it’s easier to excersise, also because I can do it in my own privacy when it suits me. I don’t have to get out on the streets and fly my colors, although I imagine it will be easier to jog for real after using the ellipse machine for a while."

We have been dancing round fires a lot longer than we have been living in a commercialised world. Our ancestors knew the multidimensional aspects of life.

174362445,"I had awoke smelling scents that did not exist, like smoke and roses, and sounds that did not exist, like playground bells. I had imagery in my mind’s eye of me being dead etc. I was later that morning confronted by several people I knew and couldn’t handle the stress, so a friend took me to a mental health center, that I believe pink slipped me to St _NAME_. I continued experiencing auditory hallucinations and delusions at the hospital. They focused on schizoid issues and paranoia and delusions, while addressing my former bi-polar diagnosis and issues. had gone there while very paranoid and manic, initially to get tested for STDs. I broke out into a scene, and heard many things that did not exist, like people from where I had been working, bombs going off, kids playing, etc. I saw my mother come and tell me “the eleventh hour is not upon us” which in fact never occurred. I saw black dots everywhere. I thought my dad was an undercover friend of mine with a mask trying to kill me. Thought ev
eryone was looking to kill me. I had not been sleeping for six or seven days. They pink slipped me to Northwest Ohio Pscychiatric Hospital. I had been experiening much mania prior to not sleeping and during my lack of sleep. I had been thinking that I was a prophet, had been paranoid that my father was dying of cancer, was paranoid of a living situation that was volatile and left me fearing for myself and my family. There is much context to all this, and more things to add of my paranoia and delusions and hallucinations mania etc I had been contemplating suicide, but not dwelling on it. Before that point, I had only considered the idea of suicide in theory, less about practically doing it. They wanted me there for suicide watch, to monitor my mental health, and to get me back on medication which I had not been taking. I had been considering suicide due to situations in my life… I had been fearing for myself and my family’s well being. I had been dealing with situations with friends in my life, and clients 
where I worked in property management, fearing they were out to get me. I think I was being monitored with my father while paying a utility bill. TV was sending me signals and messages, and that my car radio was as well. That I was being tracked via my car. That folks were and are out to kill me. That there are gangs out to get me that conspire with the city. I’m not sure which visual effects were real and not real. I had olfactory hallucinations, smells that weren’t there. Experienced imagery of death etc. I was diagnosed as Bi-Polar, with schizophrenic tendencies. I had left Hicksville Hospital and was still suffering from paranoia, that I had been taken to a bomb shelter, took me days to figure out I was in a psychiatric ward. etc etc notes: needed to go to the hospital for a couple days soon after I first started my job, so they fired me. I had developed pnemonia, and had rashes, and a circulatory problem. My blood would well up at my legs. The doctor said perhaps it was “_NAME_” disease but it di
dn’t fit many of the symptoms, no one ever figured it out. I had been trying to get a vacant house up and working with a friend, for him. Others there eventually got penmonia too. There was poison ivy, sumac, black mold, etc as possible causes. Some say it may be similar to a meth house where simply being around the vicinity given bums had lived there, can make one break out with issues. There was much stress, and many other domestic reasons going on in my life. My mental health then may have been a culprit as well in causing physical symptoms. These problems in general initiated a spiral financially and personally in my life that led to some of my other recent mental health occurrences. My mental health has caused me to lose most of my jobs that I included. My experience related to St _NAME_ cost me my job at Meijer. My expereince related to NW Ohio psychiatric cost me my job at the nonprofit job. Depression and paranoia etc had been occurring and causing me problems as a librarian and caused me to lose th
at job. Mental issues weren’t as bad when I was younger but my time as a cashier etc became more rocky as I worked the years there, and that was the only job I’ve had that I left voluntarily that I listed. I dealt with a lot of major depression then, and some moderate highs like mania. _PERSON_ was a more recent job and I couldn’t even handle that job, and it was basically like my time as a cashier and stocker. My time as an assembly worker was only a couple days, and my stresses in life and mental health cost me that job… that job was basically a quirk and hard to quantify and qualify, as I only worked two days there. Even if the stressors in my life cause me to be more “crazy” than usual, I don’t see these stressors being gone within the next year, and I can’t work because of them, I always lose my job etc. DAILY LIFE and WORK ADDENDUM: I have additinoal information for the sections that describe how my conditino affect my work, and information about my every day life. My condition and medic
ation significantly affects my daily and work life. My medication merely changes the ups and downs of my bipolar and paranoid life, to restlessness instead of highs, and detached agitated melancholy instead of lows.and more “high and low” at the same time than usual. I’ve always had restlessness but the medication makes it worse. The Latuda and Klonopin does help alleviate my paranoia, which borders sometimes on delusions, which I sometimes accect as such and sometimes don’t, despite what those close to me and doctors think. I haven’t had an psychotic episodes or hallucinations since having gotten back on the medication at Defiance, where I had paranoia, delusions, psychotic episodes, and possible hallucinations. (similar to all the hospitals I had been admitted) The Klonopin taken when I am caught up in restlessess does help lessen my condition. I don’t think there’s a way to truly smoothly transition into a calmer state, as I take the medication when I’m not calm, and if I preempt the lack o
f calm with preemptive use of medication, there’s always some turbulence in my mood and corresponding paranoia (if applicable). This turbulance, whether medine related or not, causes problems in my every day and work life. As to my daily life, the folks I live with are significantly affected. As of now they are my family, but the last two times they have been people who could deal with me, close friends. I tend to pace around houses, squirm, and lay down, a lot. I need reminders to take medication, hygeiene etc. I need someone to reason with me lest I get too caught up in my paranoia and delusions. I often have to figure how if I believe or will accept that I believe something wrongly despite evidence, per delusions. They reason with me about acting as if I am in fact experiencing delusions, because the fears I have over run my life and cause me to act in ways different than I otherwise would, such as the fear that there are people out to kill me, based on experiences at the utility center, in my car, and o
n the TV, and in passing life with others etc. I might not mow the lawn for example, because I’m afraid someone will kill me based on past bad experience with mower situations. I pace a lot because it represents my ups and downs, or my restlessness. I try to keep active to alleviate my condition, as it “keeps me busy”. Sometimes that helps, sometimes it doesn’t. When I read, that is me keeping busy. It tends to exacerbate my ups and downs, restlessness and meloncholy, though. I have always read about religion and politics, which includes many highs and lows, and that affects my life, and gets worse as I get older. Laying down helps me calm down and become collected. Sometimes I am so caught up that nothing I do can alleviate my condition. I often get critical and snappy at those around me, irritiable. I have lower social skills because I am too withdrawn or only able to talk about issues in a way that’s highly expert. When I was diagnosed as bipolar he said I might also be high functioning autistic,
but he didn’t know me well enough. I become less “normal” as I get older, can’t seem to sit down and watch movies or do normal hobbies, my interest or preoccupation or racing thoughts or catatonia is elsewehre. My appetite goes up and down a lot more, and every time I go to a hospital I end up fluctuating thirty or so pounds. I mentioned my sleep disturbances on the paperwork. Sometimes my delusions or paranoia keep me up, sometimes always does keep me up. I often have flash backs to times when I was initially admitted the first time to psychiatric hiospital and all the circumstances surrounding it. I struggle with “normal” life. As to work, all my jobs have progressively gotten worse. Most of the jobs I was fired from, except the short jobs and my time when cashering was a major component of my job and as a tutor. The hub assembly job was a quirk as my application describes. Census work was only seasonal, a few months. The time scoring was only a few months time, a seasonal job. I don’t think I 
could have kept it up. I often needed to take restroom breaks, would squirm a lot, and would have to just sit and collect myself at the expense of doing work. The time at meijer included me needing to take breaks, walk off the work area, and try adjusting to medication. The people I worked with often joked about how they thought I smoked crack, when this was not true. I struggled with deep depression. This is similar to when I worked at Walmart and Kroger, the same situation existed. I would get wrote up or talked to for depression, or “coached” on how to deal with it at work. I better handled Chief where I was for a few years, but it got progressively worse, and ended a lot more similar to _PERSON_. I would get worked up and not be able to handle the job, or I’d be too depressed. With medication, I have to handle the transitions onto and off them and the side effects, at least the restlessness and meloncholy. The time at the nonprofit my dad asked some workers if the people I’d mention from there wer
e real, cause he knew I’d been experiencing mental health episodes. Life leading up to this point caused me to lose my job, this job ended with me at Northwest Psyciatric Hospital, and _PERSON_ ended at St _NAME_. The hub assembly job ended with paranoia, possible hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, etc, at Defiance Regional. The time as a librarian ended with them recommending I take time off, and never calling me back in for work. I had been trying to be an expert at library classification systems and was confusing the systems, all part of my attempt to be an “expert”, which the highs and lows cause to be better or worse when I am being expert, or fancifulling myself as such, or facing reality when I am not. I suffered from a lot of depression in those days. As with politics and religion, I’m often left wanting to be an expert and facing another reason for highs and lows besides the typical highs and lows of volitle thought processess that are inherent with those subejcts. I feel worthless unless I a
m an expert. I also often feel worthless, that I have nothing to contribute to the world and am not where I should be, financially or relationships or career etc. My time as a math tutor was fairly normal, but I was much younger and normal back then."

Without it im quite lethargic and i lay on my bed the whole day. I still have a box of lexapro pills and I was thinking of start taking it again. The last time i was at my pdoc we didnt have much time to discuss to take it again, she just asked if i need it prescribed and I told her that i was weaned off from it. My pdoc only works on mondays and wednesdays, so i would need to wait until monday to ask her, instead i could stary taking it again and stary feeling the effects. My current pdoc was the one who prescribed me lexapro initially."
176080359,"Yeah but i’m getting these feelings again like i did with another staff member I kind of fell for the other staff member but another guy is with her now and she is pregnant now it is really upsetting but i would have liked to have been that guy but bc i am apparently mentally deranged and under her care we couldnt do anything, idk if she would have but we are very fond of each other, its a bit awkward now This new co-worker is nice too, i am getting feeling for her just bc she said she was single."

176080364,"I have anxiety. I don’t get panick attacks, you know, where you hyperventilate and feel like you’re having a heart attack. Instead, I grow increasingly nervous and restless until I either have a meltdown or start dissociating. When I tell people I have anxiety, they keep responding “try to breathe this and that way”. And yes, when I used to have anxiety attacks, breathing would calm me down. However I don’t feel like this kind of anxiety is helped by breathing. Why is breathing people’s go-to with anxiety?"

174362478,"Abstract Objective: In healthy individuals, the visuospatial attentional network consists of frontoparietal bundles; however, the anatomical organization of this network in persons with schizophrenia remains largely unknown. Using diffusion tensor imaging–based tractography, the authors investigated the white matter integrity and volume of frontoparietal and frontotemporo-occipital bundles in the right and left hemispheres and studied their structural asymmetry in persons with schizophrenia and in healthy individuals. Methods: This study included 34 participants with schizophrenia and 69 healthy individuals. Integrity parameters and volume were calculated in the three branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF I, II, and III), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in both hemispheres. Results: In the SLF II and SLF III of the right hemisphere, healthy individuals showed greater integrity, compared with participants with schizophrenia. Both g
roups presented increased integrity in the SLF III of the right hemisphere, compared with the SLF III of the left hemisphere, but only healthy individuals had this pattern regarding the SLF II. Bundle volumes did not differ between groups. Conclusions: This study is the first to describe the structural hemispheric lateralization and organization of the visuospatial attentional network in persons with schizophrenia. The main findings indicate loss of integrity in the SLF II, associated with loss of asymmetry in participants with schizophrenia, compared with healthy individuals, suggesting a potential substrate of attentional deficits.

So far, I haven’t gained weight from it, just my own personal bad eating decisions. Doesn’t completely control the voices or delusions, But I can’t complain because it’s really gotten them to a manageable point. I have the sneaking suspicion it caused me to have hair loss in the beginning, but my doctor says that’s not likely. I do. That aside, great medication."

Since this June (2019) I’ve been symptomatic.
176080396,I think I’m very unlikeable. So when people seem unfriendly it doesn’t surprise me at all. But when people are nice to me it’s a pleasant surprise. Lately I’ve met people who are kind. But I’ve been disliked by people as soon as they meet me without me even having said one word. I’ve been told I’m too nice and too quiet at work. I’m also overweight and that doesn’t help me at all . People assume I’m stuck up before they even give me s chance. Some people think I’m not cool because I’m not into football. I had a friend of my husband’s hate me because I used to be vegan.

174362508,I have ready some published studies that adding modafinil to your current medications has shown some positive outcomes in people with schizophrenia. Has anyone tried this and can comment? How could I convince my psychiatrist to let me try this as it’s not the normal approved treatment. Do people think it should be easier for people diagnosed with schizophrenia to be able to try this? Any comments or thoughts?
176080486,"Haha maybe I’m on at the wrong time of day, I’m a night owl. You’ve had your share of zingers of course but I heard you guys talk about people laying eggs and got jealous, also never seen The Flash. These stories sound particularly epic."
176080487,"Yes. I’m intolerant to visual technology as well. Too much information. Too many images. Too much scrolling and searching. I had a full time tech job when I got my first episode. It was basically doing the same operation on a computer for about 10 minutes, then repeat all day, every day. It was probably a trigger factor for my sz. It kind of makes sense though. We are the first computer generations. It takes time to adapt to such things. It’s not done in one generation."

176080489,"It just boils down to what you want to believe. A lot of schizophrenics have a problem with coincidences and attach meaning to them. While the average _NAME_ sitting in his home or walking down the street would just dismiss them for what they are, just random things that happen all over the world a million times a day. I’m not being critical but if you have a serious mental illness your brain is going to trick you. Just a couple of weeks ago I was thinking about _PERSON_ and and seconds later a _PERSON_ song came on the radio. It was kind of weird (and a little neat, lol) but it didn’t mean anything. I could go on but just be aware that part of our illness makes us think these ways. A lot of weird stuff happens in the world somewhere, every day. You’re two examples can be explained as just sheer chance which I see you kind of awknowledge. There’s thousands of people from DC and maybe one of them was visiting a relative in your city that day when you saw them. It’s not far fetched at all. 
It could have been a California license plate or _USER_ID_ or _NAME_. Those plates are probably just as rare in your city but it happen to be DC."

176080505,I have to get me a scale. My wife gave ours to my sister in law. So I only get weighed when I go to the doctor. I can’t eat any less than I already do. I eat two meals a day and very small portions. So I am going to start using my wife’s elliptical machine. She doesn’t use it. I can’t run anymore due to Geodon. That’s what I used to do. I weigh about 230 or so but when I was just on Geodon I weighed 170 but I am 6’1” and 170 was too skinny. I put the weight on with Latuda. I want to get to about 200 or so. I don’t think I can do it but I will try. I will start with 10 minutes on the elliptical. You probably need closer to 30 to get a workout though but 10 minutes is more than I am doing now.

176080512,"Thinking about recovery today. Thinking about my progress the last couple of years. Thinking about contentment. I don’t know If I will ever find contentment in my recovery. Where’s it’s progressed to. I’m impatient, and want it fixed, want it gone, and now. But that’s unrealistic isn’t it? That form of drive never leaves one satisfied, just the constant chase. I should be content with a 50% reduction in symptoms, should be content that I’m not in such a dark place. Accept that I’m always going to have this exhausting wax and wane of symptoms. I suppose I should be used to it by now. But do we ever truly “get used to it”? 22 years of voices, and they still scare me, they still pick on me and hurt me, they still try to confuse me. I just don’t know how content with that I can be. I try, but it’s still this grueling marathon of day to day life. It wears on me and I get so tired. I’m not done fighting though and that’s important to me. Maybe that’s the key… and maybe I s

176080513,"From what my sister says, my other brother has kind of gone kooky a little lately. It’s odd though because he’s always been the voice of reason. It makes me feel a little vulnerable in this world. It’s like who do you go to when the voice of reason has gone mad? Anyway, I guess he’s getting a little better but there for awhile he was saying strange things and acting up a bit. The stress of being out of work and struggling financially is getting to she thinks. But she helped him out and now he’s acting a little more like himself again. I think the stress of _PERSON_ was weighing heavy on him too, he’s in Southern California in the thick of it and there’s lot’s of elderly relatives on his wife’s side of the family down there who are at risk to worry about."
174362517,"# Schizophrenia: When the thalamus misleads the ear Quote: “The scientists made a further observation: in the patients suffering from auditory hallucinations, they noticed a hyper-connectivity between the thalamic nuclei and cortical areas devoted to the primary processing of hearing and _PERSON_’s area, which is highly significant for understanding language. This type of thalamo-cortical hyper-connection is normal during childhood, when the neural networks are being formed. The fact that it persists during adolescence and then into adulthood is the sign that the connections have never reached maturity.” “Abnormal development and dysconnectivity of distinct thalamic nuclei in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome experiencing auditory hallucinations”. by _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_.

Change in gamma power was associated with change in cognition. Significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms were also found.

176080600,"Think about all the poor & suffering this Christmas, not everyone is going to get a fancy dinner or Special gifts, people are homeless & thirsty & miserable, people without hope, we should reach out to them & try & give them a blessing this year, they deserve it more than we do Blessings to the weak and infirm, blessings to the hungry, thirsty, and lost, I wish everyone a Merry Christmas but especially to the ones who really desperately need it, i pray they find some peace, Love and Happiness, give hope to the hopeless, Love to all, Pray for everyones needs to be fulfilled, rest for the weary, food for the starving, medicine for the ill, relief."
176080601,"Ive been on one of the APs for 3 months. The other two only for 2-3 weeks. So there is still hope, im just worried. And i told my pdoc and he said he doesnt think the symptoms im experiencing will go away. Even if what i think reality is isnt a delusion, its still beautiful. I just wish my brain would stop connecting dots in what people say. Hints are being dropped every interaction i have. People say something, at face value it means this, but if you think about it its clear they were confirming my ‘delusions’. I have a lot of realities, some contradict. but no matter what reality im in, even the one that is described as normal, im still delusional. I grieve my sanity. How easy i use to have it."
176080602,I take a 100mg Haldol depot. I’m gonna see if pdoc will raise it to 150. I’m not experiencing any sedation from it. I do sleep about 12 hrs a night. The side effects are mild. I don’t even feel overly hungry. A+ would recommend
176080603,My niece went through a phase at 5 years old where she would poop her pants. Don’t know what was going on there. Her mother hung around some pretty shady characters so idk. My niece when she was 5 lived with my dad. I told my dad he needed to take her to the doctor but he just brushed me off. No 5 year old kid has any business pooping their pants. She didn’t do it at my house though cos I made her wear pull ups and she didn’t like that.

176080605,Is it a robot??
176080606,Which religion would you like me to explain it to you in. It won’t be religious talk. Just a base to start from so I understand where you’re coming from.
176080607,Whoa! I hope that doesn’t happen to me!
176080608,"I dunno-- things are so much simpler as kiddos, I think that’s why we might believe we were happier then.

176080612,Good luck with that!
176080613,I started a new job and one benefit is free food. I took advantage of it a little too much and gained weight hahaha. I tried the whole menu and now I know what to recommend to people at least. Point of the rambling being that unfortunately it did take a toll on my mental health. I have noticed over the years that my diet and vitamin intake is crucial to maintaining my SZ so I try to eat high quality meat not deep fried or anything. And I try to eat delicious things like veggie sandwiches at subway or like just a chicken breast with some brussel sprouts
176080614,I am good at trying new approaches to a problem until I succeed. I don’t just give up.

176080621,Just because you like to keep to yourself doesn’t mean you don’t like people _PERSON_. It just means you have been hurt terribly and are not easily trusting of others. If you are happy with the way you are living then I can see no reason for you having to separate the two. Can someone smarter than me please answer _PERSON_’s question.
176080622,How old are you?
176080623,Go to the ER if you think you have to hurt yourself or anyone else
176080624,"You’re loved by a lot of people. They just don’t have to express it constantly. I think you should hang around more people though, to feel emotionally fulfilled. You can’t pick your family so much, but you can pick your friends."
176080625,"Sorry you felt so bad. You are not evil! Good that you build up a life. My delusions changed. It started with a fear of persecution by my ex (“poor me” paranoia), which was very near the truth. The more i was psychotic, the more evil i thought i was (“bad me” paranoia), the more things got existential/relgious and the more bizar. I too was the cause of all the evil in the world. With all sorts of bizar details. Here too there was a link to reality. My mum told me as a kid i was bad, the cause of all problems, etc. I started to act upon that too in response. Both caused guilt and shame. I am working through these feelings and my delusions seem to get slightly less bizar again…closer to genuine guilt, horribly low selfesteem, mourning and emotional flasbacks."
176080626,Welcome back. Stay longer!
176080627,yea i hope the seroquel increase helps you too… best of luck with everything!
176080628,"Just through word of mouth I have enough jobs to last me until end of June! I have only been looking for two weeks. This makes me confident I can do this. Quitting my office job had to happen as it was getting too much for me to handle and it was making me ill. Being my own boss and working outside will be great, and I will lose my 1 hour to and 1 hour back from work each day"
176080629,"I find strange coincidences still very noticeable, 11 years after starting meds. The difference now is that I don’t have the same overwhelming sense of significance attached to them. About 30 minutes ago I laughed at one strong coincidence and looked up to the heavens as if I was being made fun of by the universe. I let that one go through to the keeper. Bizarre but manageable. Are you on medication? Do you talk to your doctor about the coincidences you see?"
176080630,Is there anyway of taking these topics off the internet?
176080631,I try to _USER_ID_ my email address and stop receiving emails from the site.

176080636,"It stoped my growth. I went to university and had great plans for my life, but psychosis ended all of that. I was very sick and got violent. It was like a war that I went threw. Now I’m stable, but I can’t achieve anything. The worst part is that I have this pride that won’t let me accept that I’m sick. I see people around me thrive and grow and make money, but I’m not doing anything. But at the end of the day I have to accept my illness and make the best out of it. I hope you find something that helps your negative symptoms, but I think you have to accept that you are sick."
176080637,"on Free Sheri! on Facebook, complete strangers say, Somebody hasn’t taken their meds. I’m completely coherent, there’s nothing wrong about what I’m saying. Really makes me mad. people on my friends list never say it though, probably because I sometimes take a pic of my pills laid out on the table."
176080638,You have to yell to make your point. _PERSON_ lol
176080639,"I was almost immediately approved because I was very messed up and my care was expensive almost from the start. I remember I was on it very shortly after my parents complained about the price of my meds. I don’t know if it involved a lawyer but I wouldn’t be surprised. I had a sinking feeling when the guys signing me on asked if I had a bank account and then said it could be no more than $2,000 and for many years afterwards you couldn’t even work for pay… I’ve heard there’s a movement to end that rule and there is ABLE accounts as well so you guys may have it better. (you can’t do crap with $2,000 or less.)"
176080640,"Positives: Paranoia, hallucinations, voices, delusions of reference…etc. Negatives: Poor sleep, issues with showering, tired, unmotivated, difficulty shaving, doing laundry, eating properly."
176080641,That’s awesomeness! _AT_MENTION_ What medication put you on the right track?
176080642,lol maybe some peed there lol.
176080643,I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you.
176080644,"I have major problems with pleasure and enjoyment. I can’t listen to music much either. Doing most things that used to bring me enjoyment and happiness just make me sad now because I can’t feel anything positive from them. It’s all gotten much worse since my last major episode, back in July of 2019."
176080645,"I think that stuff is a waste of money, if you eat healthy the body cleans itself, no need for stuff like that"
176080646,"The more you pay attention the more you fixate. I get obsessed with mine because of some real things in the past. But it was driving me crazy. Couldn’t sleep, thought they were plotting, etc. _PERSON_’s mane extract from RealMushrooms on Amazon cut my anxiety and obsessing to near 0. it worked fast, too. Same day i took it that afternoon i went shopping and walked by myself to browse first time in years."
176080647,That’s good. Cause last night my sleep was awful especially last night. I feel so I’ll today from lack of sleep. _PERSON_ even walked the dog.
176080648,"Can I have an advice for you? If you don’t see the dirt by your eyes then neglect your soul which knows the dirt is there, I use faucet in toilet to wash myself and then I wash my hands with water and soup, Wish you the best,"
176080649,No. I started taking it and by the end of the week I was suicidal and had to be monitored as it got out of my system. 2 days later I was back to being happy and content.
176080650,"Just know that we are here for you. Try producing unharmful sensations. Like holding an ice cube. I don’t have PTSD myself, but someone close to me recommended this to help. How are you holding up?"
176080651,"Me too. It’s tough to be consistent. Maybe try lamictal, depakote, or topamax?"
176080652,"The effects it has on your sleep. There are claims that IF can help improve sleep HOWEVER at least in the beginning this is not the case. When your body is hungry it releases things like adrenaline and cortisol that make you alert and awake. Most people fast at night. The combination can give pretty bad insomnia. For weeks I could not fall asleep at night at all. It has gotten better and I can now fall asleep but my sleep is extremely disrupted, even more so than usual, and often I wake up very early and can simply not fall back asleep. I can’t actually remember the last time I slept in. You’ll want to keep this in mind because the lack of sleep can flare up your symptoms. It flared up mine pretty bad I hadn’t experienced them like that in ages. In addition it meant I was drinking more caffeine to stay awake during the day which basically cancelled out my bladder medication, so my overactive bladder has been really flared up too unfortunately. Thankfully since I started getting some sleep aga
in my mental health symptoms have calmed down. It will give you major crashes after you eat meals. I have seen varying reasons as to why this is, I think the most likely is that it increases your sensitivity to insulin. Thus if you eat a big meal, especially at the end of the fast, your body gets flooded with insulin, which makes you very very sleepy. You may pass out while you digest which can take hours! Combined with being sleep deprived you may just sleep all day! I was very dysfunctional for several weeks due to this combo. I suspect you can fix this issue by having a small meal to break your fast. However after you have been fasting for 14, 16 or however many long hours, you are not going to want to break your fast with a tiny sad meal trust me!! It will affect your mood. I don’t know about anyone else but I get severely grumpy and emotional when I am hungry. This is a big deal because with intermittent fasting you are hungry for a long period of time. So just be aware of this and the effect it can ha
ve on the people around you. Anyways those are the things I was not told about intermittent fasting."
176080653,It’s good to put a face to a peer. I don’t think you have anything to worry about. I would say that you deserve some pampering. You deserve to feel attractive. Deserve a day where you can feed your _PERSON_’s instead of always being caretaker.
176080654,"Welcome! I get this thought broadcasting stuff too. You’re right, there are many ways of disproving it. I once went through a period where I TRIED to telepathically communicate my credit card number to people. But it didn’t work, thus proving thought broadcasting isn’t real or reliably so. Or it could have been a massive conspiracy was my next thought, but why? No reason ever materialized and I made other conclusions or found alternate possibilities for the voices explanation. Also it turns out nobody has the time, money, or effort necessary to harass someone as much as they did me (and others like you), so it must be an internal thing. But why? Sublimated feelings and thoughts, angels and demons or fairies or aliens, Scientologist, i don’t know. But what I do know is that meds helped me get it under control. Probably from internal issues arising due to an artifact of evolution."

176080661,"It’s so frustrating. My mental health team unfortunately caught the brunt of my frustrations about this, as I don’t personally think it’s acceptable to diagnose and not treat (In a sense - I accept nothing will cure it) My psychologist said to me before that a diagnosis would help her treat me. Then the other day she says her techniques won’t work on someone with autism, and now I am discharged from Psychology"

174362537,I think it shows sz burns hard and fast in young men and more gradually in women. I think this graph may suggest our sz simply burns out by 65. By that I mean few positive symptoms and much more negative symptoms
176080663,_AT_MENTION_ My illusions sometimes don’t scare me because I am used to it and my pdoc says I don’t have Alzheimer’s. But sometimes I am shocked at first. I have hallucinations sometimes and they scare me bad. I get paranoia bad when ill. And I am always on guard now. It’s stinks but I’ve learned to live with a lot. Good to know someone with STD has these motivation problems that have gotten worse. Sorry to hear that though it’s an awful thing. Good to know we aren’t completely alone in the world with this. At least we have this forum because I don’t know of any STD support groups or psycho-education counselling for STD. I am grateful for your connecting.

176080668,"Since making a recovery, I do feel that I have lost some cognitive functioning. I always have trouble trying to find words or with finishing sentences. My memory isn’t as good as it used to be. It is upsetting. However, I don’t give up. My aspiration is to go back to uni and complete another degree. But first I’m gonna support my partner who will be going back to uni next year to complete a teaching degree."
176080669,Lol. How would we call an emergency number for you when we don’t know who you are or where you live? I think quitting meds for you at this point is a bad idea but…Good Luck.

I know it’s easier said than done, but try not to let the stress and worry get out of control. Try to spend your time and energy on positive things you can do such as working on your farm. Also, maintain good hygiene such as regular hand washing. Perhaps you can help your mom and sister with things such as grocery shopping, if needed."

174362534,"i’m just curious if anyone here knows about the answer to this. off labels users are like those with autism or depression who use antipsychotics for those diseases while they dont have a psychotic disorder. there is controversy that if a schizophrenic gets off antipsychotics, that they might experience psychosis just due to the withdrawal effect, and not so much the disease itself. some doctors say it’s the withdrawal effect and some say it’s the underlying disease. but what happens to off label users when they withdraw? if they experience psychosis too, then that is a strong indicator that it’s the withdrawal effect. ***if they dont experience psychosis, then the situation is such that schizophrenics who withdraw might just be predisposed to the withdrawal effect, if it’s not still the underlying disease causing it. **** i’m mostly curious to see if my theory is right: my guess is that off label users dont experience withdrawal psychosis, and if it’s the withdrawal effect for schizop
hrenic withdrawal folks, they are just predisposed to it because of their disease. of course the alterantive theory could be true too, that it’s the underlying disease only causing the problem to begin with. sometimes i wonder how fully i’m a schizo, but given i have experience the range of symptoms typical of a schizo, and had withdrawal problems, that it’s proof positive that i shouldn’t second guess my condition so much. i know once i made the stupid comment to my psych nurse that i was paranoid of taking medication cause antipsychotics i heard caused psychosis. then she pointed out that lots of off label users dont experience psychosis. this is a similar question but it’s different than the question at hand, because now i’m wondering about withdrawal effect differences in the two populations."
176080683,"Effexor, venlafaxine is the one that works. I need a lot of it because I came off it once to try something else and it takes a lot more after going back to it. Works well. You miss a dose though on 300 mgs you really know it by lunch. It’s withdrawal is sudden and noticeable."
174362549,"Sorry you’re having such a rough go of it. I felt really bad the first couple months I was on it, Probably the first six months.

176080709,"We called my doctor because I’m not doing well at all. Thankfully, we set up an appointment with him tomorrow morning. Basically, I feel like I’m sliping into psychosis again. I have this strange feeling before every relapse that I feel myself encroaching a state of psychosis again. I’ve had this peculiar feeling all week, but no symptoms up until now. I’ve also been more acrimonious lately, which is a sign of doing unwell. I got these symptoms in the latter half of the day causing me great feelings of chagrin and discomfort.

I could feel the voices sense of humour to things, including people sometimes just appeared funny. Like one time I couldn’t stop laughing at someone’s nose.

My family thinks I’m doing better mentally, but I beg to differ. He’s also telling me not to say anything that could spark argument. And seeing the argument today on the forum only reinforces that belief. I want to believe this is a delusion, but now I’m not sure if it is. Maybe he is actually speaking to me? I don’t know anymore, it’s so confusing. I guess this more of a rant post, but I feel like I need extra care from my support system if it gets any worse. Hopefully I don’t lose insight."

Apples, oranges, bananas, figs, peaches, apricots, plums, pears, raspberries, mango… I could keep going! If you think you don’t like fruit, try going organic. A lot of cheap fruit doesnt taste good because it is pumped full of chemicals. The organic stuff is hugely better. B) Drink coffee (black or white)."

176080793,"the transfer of “the poop” to “my poop” has existential qualities. agricultural scholars have long attempted to personify a movement without much success. I know, I once drove by a duck farm for five years. Releasing “that smells” to “a smell” takes real courage and practice. With each passing day, I’d focus on the rank. And I’d look at the ducks. After years of discipline, the smell became one with that stretch of the highway. I became conditioned to the olfactory intrusion. Taking clients by the farm elicited remarks, what’s that smell… roll up the window. Marginalizing your own bm takes the same patience and dedication. Smell it, understand it. it is the bile of you, embrace it. In regards to coitus, I’ll agree, but only to a french exit. I do not do a tuxedo surprise."

176080798,"What you guys need is something called a suitable replacement behavior. I had a big problem with biting my hangnails until they bled. So I started painting them with a special bitter flavored nail polish designed to stop kids from sucking their thumbs. The bad taste alerts me that I am doing it. Then I force myself to stop, and start chewing gum instead. Fidgit jewelry can help. Picking apart your clothes instead of your skin can help. You don’t want to ruin your clothes, but it is certainly better than hurting your body. Carrying a Styrofoam block and picking pieces out of it can help. You need to find a repetitive, soothing behavior that gives you the same sensory feedback as picking. You could try wearing a bracelet with a ribbon on it, and picking apart strands of the ribbon. Then, when that ribbon is too frayed, replace it with a new ribbon. Whatever works for you. In the beginning, it is so hard to stop. But after some practice, you can retrain your brain to subconsciously reach for the rep
lacement behavior instead of picking."

There is a Japanese philosopher (_PERSON_) that claims that we all have a beast inside us (he uses a neologism, “we have been Mephistophelized”) "". That I think explains how we manage to split ourselves, as is claimed by many psychologists (_PERSON_’s super ego, _PERSON_’s ‘super-addressee’, _PERSON_’s “generalized other”, _PERSON_’s Other, _PERSON_’s I and Me, _NAME_’s “impartial spectator”, _PERSON_’s “Others in mind”); in order to have a self one needs to have an internal observer, they say. It may be possible to hide someone else inside oneself, if that other person is really big, bad and scary."

176080829,YOU FAILED A GRADE AND NOW YOU ARE PAYING FOR IT YOU ??????? Stupid person oh my god just ??????? give up
176080830,I weighed 159.6 lbs yesterday. I weighed 160.2 lbs. this am. I am in the general range I want to be in. I practice yoga for about half an hour almost every day. I also practice piano for an hour almost daily. I also do ten simple burpees almost daily. These activities keep me pretty fit and feeling good.
176080831,"I’ve called the cops twice as an adult. Once because I could hear our upstairs neighbors throwing ???? and yelling and they broke a window and the woman was always bruised, so I want taking chances. I called the cops on them. The second time I saw our upstairs neighbors leave and then about half hour later their baby started crying and wouldn’t stop. It cried for over an hour and was starting to lose his voice. Or was so raspy and sad. We went and knocked on the door to make sure everything was okay because the baby started to sound like it was choking, but no one answered and their car was still not back yet. Good thing I called on that baby, though, because our upstairs neighbor left hey baby with her boyfriend’s and the boyfriend overdosed and was passed out while the baby just screamed and screamed."
176080832,"I was a tomboy until adolescence and then I got super shy. I remember the local cop starting a car club for teens and I think one girl showed an interest. Funny thing is, I can’t even remember if she was accepted or not. I was already tired of the fight."
176080833,i’m not sure i trust the vaccine either… i’ll prob get it eventually cause they gonna push me but if i have to go out to go get it then i won’t get it… if they come to give it to me at home then maybe. But i’m not sure it can be trusted…
176080834,"I’m up because it’s 7:15 here in Spain. I have taken my meds, I have showered and now I’m drinking a cup of coffee."
176080835,"I don’t think I’ll get it, I mean either way it doesn’t matter even though pretty much nobody really notices anything about me since I stay in my room a lot."
176080836,"When it comes to medical advice and who you should follow it goes: You > Pdoc > Family > Friends. Which I realise is not helpful. I’m just trying to say that it is up to you what your next move is. What do you want to do? Think about it deeply and slowly. If you are at the point of possibly getting frustrated and making an attempt on your life, then you do need to go to the hospital. I know it’s not a fun place, but they can maybe look at your meds as _AT_MENTION_ suggested."
176080837,That’s really similar to my sleep schedule. I wake up an hour or two past noon but always set my alarm for 9:00am. I take 20mg olanzapine and 1000mg depakote. What time do you usually fall asleep? I usually go to bed around 1:00am. I work late so I don’t get home til about midnight.
176080838,I’ve restarted coffee ! And I feel 100% worse.

176080842,"Hi all, Just wondering: what’s the difference between a psychotic break and a psychotic episode? Is it severity? Length of time? Subject matter? Personally, I think an episode is like a flare-up of psychosis, and a psychotic break is losing complete touch with reality, but I’d like to know your thoughts!"
176080843,"But doesn’t it scare you? make you doubt? When a statistic overwhelming fits an idea? Because that is how I feel about it. You are right, but idk, can people really be that understanding for that long? I mean for marriage/ long relationships"

I remember I even posted about hearing the voices and thinking they were thoughts… _AT_MENTION_ even replied saying “welcome to reality” (paraphrasing). I’m an idiot."
174362587,"Sometimes i feel its someone making the voices sometimes i think its got a religious/spiritual thing going on, sometimes i think ive been drugged but these days its easier to say i have mental illness then it is to believe the other crap so thats what i go with mostly even tho im not always sure."

And a blue phone booth in our living room my parents swear wasn’t there. (For this I definitely joke that The Doctor visited me as a child.)

176080909,Paranoid and guilt-related delusions most of the time. Things like: “Other people are out to get me.” or “I have hurt thousands of people and I need to pay for the sins.” Another common delusion is: “Other people are talking badly about me.”

176080931,I was not the most worldly guy at age 19. I got around a bit but I never “ran the streets” or anything like that. So when I was 19 and moved into a group home I was shocked to discover that one of the older residents had spent time in prison. I was indignant that they would let someone like that live there and I even told the head guy who ran the place to kick him out. They didn’t kick him out and eventually I learned he was pretty harmless and I didn’t fear him. And eventually we got some guy who had been in jail and a year later when I was hospitalized it seemed that half the guys had been to jail and it didn’t bother me.
176080932,You should be proud of yourself for having the guts to ask someone out.

176080958,Hi _AT_MENTION_. I am sorry you want to leave.
176080959,"Honestly, I find it easier to talk to people who know about my illness. Now, that only includes my immediate family (some extended family) and the docs, but at least I don’t have to feel like I’m hiding something. When I feel like I have to hide something, like talking to a neighbor or old friend (who both don’t know about my illness), it stresses me out and I have trouble communicating. Not sure why it’s like that"

176080965,I’m so glad to hear you are remembering good memories of your mom!
174362615,"Hi everyone, my name is _NAME_. To start with, I’m not even sure if I’m posting this in the right forum; this is also my first time talking to other people with schizophrenia. I just wanted to release this out into cyberspace and see if someone else will read it and appreciate the wild odyssey I’ve been on for years. So here’s my story, distilled. When I was 17 (now 32), I fell into a steadily worsening depression. I also began creating fantasies in my head that I could escape to in order to cope with reality. I loved to write creatively, so using my imagination to this end didn’t strike me as a sign of mental illness. My senior year of high school, my personality began to distort. I would make jokes with friends about our teachers, would imagine people I saw dancing naked, and had several instances where I laughed uncontrollably and had to leave class and stay in the bathroom until I could regain control of myself. The summer after I graduated, I became acutely suicidal and began to suff
er from anxiety and panic attacks. I started hearing the elf princess from the _PERSON_ of the _PERSON_ in my head, seducing me to commit suicide so that I could escape to her realm. Eventually the suicidal compulsions became uncontrollable, and I attempted. Luckily, my dad found me and took me to the hospital. I was transferred to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features. The psychiatrist at the hospital started me on a mood stabilizer and anti-depressant. Over the next year I recovered, but felt like my personality remained altered and my creativity had ceased. As I began my first year of college, I felt my mind slowly detaching from reality. I thought the medications I was on were making me sedated, so I stopped them and broke off with the psychiatrist. Somehow I made it through that school year, but that summer I moved back in with my dad and ceased to function. I also had a range of physical sensations along with deteriorating mental capacity, and became convince
d that I was suffering from a mysterious physical disease. I went to doctor after doctor, and had countless tests performed which all came back normal. I began to investigate alternative medicine, and diagnosed myself as having intestinal fungal overgrowth (which doesn’t actually occur unless you are severely immunocompromised) . Over the next 11 years over my life, I trialed countless remedies to cure myself of the illness, alternatively believing that my dad’s house was contaminated with black mold or mildew, or that certain foods were disrupting my microbiome and leading to my mental confusion. My dad, who suffered a frontal-lobe brain injury years prior, never pushed me to get a job, and mostly left me to my own devices. Over the years, I would have periods of almost remission where I would cease to have physical symptoms but would have lingering brain fog, and periods of intense and persistent hallucinations which to me felt like being stuck in a waking dream. I would have conversations with differen
t people in my head, and would listen to them talking with one another, but became so accustomed to it that I never realized I was stuck in a psychosis. To make matters worse, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia by both a psychiatrist and a therapist, but I refused to accept the diagnosis and my dad never forced me to take medication for it. Flash forward to last August, when I had my first full-blown psychotic episode. I was hospitalized and started on Haldol, which made me incredibly sedated, and then switched to Seroquel, after which I began to substantially improve. Over the next few months, I was able to travel and resume many activities, but (as I can see now) my mind didn’t fully return. I enjoyed having fun but had no interest in making new friends or thinking about my plans for the future. Starting two months ago, the physical sensations began to re-manifest. At first I suspected that the Seroquel had elevated my blood sugar, and eventually deluded myself that it had lowered my white blood cell coun
t and that I would have to cease taking it. After four days off the medicine, I spiraled into a much more severe psychotic episode and was hospitalized. The severity of the psychosis forced the psychiatrist to continually increase my dosage to 600 mg, which I am now on. Within three days, the voices and hallucinations stopped, but something far more dramatic began to happen. All at once, my long-term memories began to rush back in, and I spontaneously found myself thinking and planning about the future and remembering my old personality. My creativity and writer’s voice returned, along with my vocabulary and imagination. I am now less than a week out of the hospital, but I continue to feel dramatic improvements daily. It’s as if this higher dose has finally reawakened my mind, and I’m now able to process everything that has happened and start to think about where I want to go from here. The hospital psychiatrist told me that he’d only seen a handful of cases where the patient responded so rapidly to t
he dosage increase, and that it is a good sign that I will have a substantial recovery over the next months. For the first time in 14 years, I can feel my old mind steadily returning. I’m now faced with all of the horrific memories of those years of being un-medicated, and am trying to figure out what that experience will mean to my life moving forward. Posting here, along with going a local support group for people with schizophrenia is my first step. I know I still have a long way to go in my recovery, but I am very optimistic that my progress will steadily continue. Thanks for reading this long vent. I’d appreciate hearing other members’ perspectives, and I look forward to participating more in the forum and getting to know everyone here. Take care, _NAME_"

174362622,"The _USER_ID_ of mental illness includes being judged for expressions and thoughts. For example, one person might trust Abilify an older one spoke well of Lithium before.

The _NAME_ person once spoke of Lithium as a cure all and then Prozac, everyone later laughed about the cure-all. Now the person taking Abilify is unhappy and asking about Vraylar yet they spoke of another person perhaps the _NAME_, who was on Invega badly for speaking ill of Abilify, and so the younger whose uncle and parent was possibly on Prolixin is now thinking about changing medications to Vraylar or that new Chinese one the driver poster spoke of Wen-something or other, and due to their own insecurity and pridefulness, they fear being insulted and belittled for switching meds.

Theres less incentive now to do a good delivery. He wanted to keep 50% to give us an incentive to do a good delivery. But now the customers are like “And $10 for you” i’m like “ughhh well $5 actually because 50% goes to my boss…sigh”. I dont say that but I dont really get excited about tips anymore. Its like getting some weak drugs. Just doesnt give you the high you wanted or expected.

It brought me to tears it was so good. And everyone was lined up afterwards to congratulate them on how good they were. I almost didn’t stay because they already knew how good they were, but I wanted them to know how they made me feel. So I stayed. I was the last person in line. I went on to explain how their blues touched me and it made me feel like I had done a line of cocaine. And they said they had some. I said great can I get some of that. We took off towards this old hotel. We had to squeeze through some pretty tight spaces to get to their room and finally when we got there someone from sz.com was there chopping out a line of meth. They asked if I was a friend. I said no I’m a cop and laughed. The I came over and took the rolled up dollar bill out of his hand and informed him that I would be doing part of his line. But j
ust a little. I had to convince him that it was ok because I would leave plenty for him and he was very happy with that. Meanwhile the two blues musicians were just getting done chopping up the lines of cocaine and I went over there and asked them if I should do both lines now and if so should I do them in the same nostril. Then I snorted the cocaine in each nostril and woke up."

174362638,"Differences in outcomes among help-seeking individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis were sought to be characterized by identifying covariant longitudinal patterns of symptoms and functioning. Researchers applied group-based multitrajectory modeling to longitudinal ratings of four symptom domains (positive, negative, disorganized, general) and general functioning among clinical high-risk individuals in an initial discovery sample (N = 422). In the discovery sample, high-risk individuals were identified to comprise three trajectory groups: group 1 (30%) that showed substantial improvement across all domains, with half reaching positive outcomes for both functioning and positive symptoms; group 2 (49%) that showed moderate impairments across domains, with nearly one-quarter meeting criteria for positive outcomes; the remaining participants for the group 3 (22%) that showed consistent levels of severe impairment across domains and did not experience positive outcomes. In an independent sample (N 
= 133), replication of these trajectory groups and remission patterns was achieved. The observed trajectory subgroups suggest that clinical interventions are required in different degrees, ranging from minimal or supportive for about one-third of cases to increasingly intensive among the remainder. https://www.mdlinx.com/journal-summaries/psychosis-outcome-studies-clinical-high-risk/2019/09/13/7578301/"

176081074,"_AT_MENTION_ Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant.

176081096,"Yes, I see it was stupid to think learning too much is bad. I just worry about pride. I worry my mind will expand too much. My voices told me it was bad to be too intellectual. And I wondered if it might damage my Imagination. But I love reading too much to ever give it up. It took a lifetime to learn to read because of my illness. It’s good to disobey the voices. It’s primarily a conscious mind activity, and we need that so dominated by the subconscious as we are. I stopped believing my voices are anything but me. I face the reality I am all alone in my room and it’s not unbearable. It’s a damn miracle."

It’s really all about the condition of the immune systems and comorbidities that are more significant than the numbers of cases. We’re just not healthy. It’s estimated that only about a dozen percent of people in the US are metabolically healthy. Not to mention the highly widespread vitamin D and zinc deficienies.

174362654,I felt my dad is manipulating me and my mom. the minute he gets up he is telling every one what to do and always making use of me like every second. always telling me to do things he never did. He never cleaned the house at all and when company comes over he does the cooking wich is cool. He went to his job for like 10 hours a day workaholic became millionare and just does some good cooking at home while me and my mom work on the house. and when we complain we have no money he says get a job. I feel like it is so unfair to put me to work the minute I get up till he goes to bed doing anything and everything for him. and then tell me to get a job. Still to lose him would be my biggest nightmare because I realize we keep growing and appreciate each other.

Inability to save money,painful periods. I’m now getting what seems to be painful muscle spasms.

Is this a bad way to approach things and has this worked for anyone else. _USER_ID_. I dont actually know if I heard voices or not but I dont think I did. My psychosis is persicutory and primarily involved one of my neighbors spying on me. I no long get these thoughts any more."

176081124,"Maybe it could be a good idea to Google some reviews, if you haven’t already. Just so you could have a better all round understanding. After my first appointment, I wasn’t anxious about trying Vraylar, after how it sounded to me. That following afternoon I read some reviews and people had a wide range of results from it, and I understood a bit more about what it could do. However, the four days it was in my system were not fun. Hence the Risperidone. Which I also review checked and again read mixed results from people. My psychiatrist has also sent me some swabs so they can look at my DNA/genes and have a better idea what would and wouldn’t be beneficial to me. Is that something which has been offered to you? Might be worth a try. I haven’t sent the swabs back as the Risperidone is working so far. I hope everything works out for you."

176081126,"I can’t function on even the smallest dose of this anti-depressant. As much as I would like to be able to handle this, I cannot. I’m crashing now from the day, trying to sleep again and I think it will come. So maybe I should accept that I can’t feel emotions through medication. That this kind of illness won’t work with anti-depressants. I need to strengthen my willpower not to self-medicate through stimulant like cocaine. I think Prozac might be a type of stimulant, or something but at a certain point even though I felt like when I was a teenager again, maybe I just have to accept that the new me will never be able to be the old me. I’m just a different person now than I was, I can’t go back to that old me. The suicidal feelings have gone, subsided, and the Abilify is bringing me back. I’ve decided not to go to rehab either. I don’t feel comfortable right now with being outside and around people in this vulnerable situation. I’m pressuring myself too much to be someone I’m not. 
I need to go with the flow, I don’t need to prove to anyone I’m trying not to be a failure. I need to stop letting people’s frustration get ahead of where I’m at and need to be. I have to be grateful I’m still alive and breathing, and I am grateful I just wish there was more light at the end of the tunnel and that this will pass and I can feel human emotions again. I know I would be welcome at the place, and I may end up still going because I have contemplations of numbing myself with crack cocaine again but this stuff is hurting my heart and really messing me up. Ughhh. Its when someone asks me if I want the drug, I first say no, then Im full of anxiety like I break into a sweat thinking that the next time I pick up will be the last and that it will end the agony or anxiety and I’ll be happy in my little universe. A really unhealthy habit especially when you are alone and this pandemic is so stressful. I’m tempted to throw the bottle of prozac away so _PERSON_ not tempted in the morning to keep

All of the charts were similar, but mine was unusual int that I had a low amplitude of beta waves, which was considered a good thing for people who want to be enlightened. However, since I was the only one as far as I know, who was diagnosed with Sz, I was wondering if the reason I had audio hallucinations was that I had low Beta. I misplaced my chart but maybe I can get another copy. I was wondering if either using neurofeedback or binaural beats (beta range) for 1/2hr to an hr a day every day for 6 months would be beneficial.

176081141,"Thanks for the post, You might like to see this related paper "" Errant gardeners: glial-cell-dependent synaptic pruning and neurodevelopmental disorders"" https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.110 Two of the takeaways of the paper (among others) Autism spectrum disorders are associated with excessive synapses, autophagy and dysregulated microglial function. Schizophrenia is linked to exaggerated synaptic pruning owing to elevated levels of complement proteins and microglial activation. My understanding is there are too many synapses in ASD and too few in SCZ. Because of that, I think of ASD and SCZ as sort of opposite disorders. Additionally, If you dig into the research they discuss SCZ reporting “more self-related aversive feelings in response to the distress of others.” Self-reported empathic abilities in schizophrenia - PubMed Which in the context of ASD being the opposite of SCZ makes sense. ASDs have problems experiencing empathy. While an SCZ experiences too many “feelings in respo
nse to the distress of others!” We know that empathy deficit causes devastating social problems in ASD. I guess too much empathy in SCZ will cause devastating social problems too?"

Yeah I had tons of adrenaline, and after a while immense stress. It started out with seeing neon heads in things then people I knew before I fell asleep. But by the end I had 3D graphics that looked like dated computer games I could litteraly see the pixels in the 3d simulations projected over my vision. First “they” showed me 2006 type graphics but then I got shown 2016 type graphics, if that makes sense. I even had computer graphics in my dreams once in a while. Also voices with different angles, like one I call Voice of God that one is semi surround, seems to come from 180 degrees at same time like an array of speakers lined up in a half circle.

I have these symptoms: missing meals, eating very little or avoiding eating any foods you see as fattening believing you are fat when you are a healthy weight or underweight On the page that linked me to it, which initially caught my attention was this: “when you try to keep your weight as low as possible by not eating enough food, exercising too much, or both” I have been obsessed with weight loss, and even though I have come so far, I still think I am really overweight when I am not. My diet I refuse to change, I do a lot of physical work and swimming and I am tiring myself out to try and stop myself from putting on weight.

176081172,"When I was younger I didn’t give death much thought. I wasn’t really afraid to die mostly because I hadn’t given it some serious thinking. I did a lot of dumb ????. One time I had an psychotic episode with involved the delusion that the boss of a drug cartel had placed a hit on me. I was freaking out and had to be hospitalized. My memory of it is a little fuzzy but I remember seeing a security guard with a holstered handgun. In my panic I mentioned how that little gun would not be enough to stop them. In my mind, men armed with AK-47’s were going to storm the hospital and kill me within the hour. I had to be sedated, still thinking I’d die while sedated. I realized then that for sure I am afraid to die. I don’t give it much thought but I sure as hell do not want to be murdered."
176081173,"I know…I should go. I have been referred to a medical specialist by my GP, but i felt depressed a while back and didnt want to go. I should call for an appointment with the specialist. Thanks."
174362671,A breakdown of serious depression but with some hindsight there was a fair bit of paranoia even back then.

176081176,I know a few of you have been on weight loss medication. What have you been on? How much did you lose over what time frame? What were the side effects? What other meds were you on with the weight loss meds? I am going to the doctor next Friday and would like to know more before I go.
176081177,But he doesn’t recognise which memories are strange. That is why I am asking this person to doubt and doubt his narrative.
176081178,"Yeah. I worked at a place for one and a half year, then had my first psychosis and returned afterwards and worked for another 10 months or so before I got let go because of cutbacks. Looking back I think it must have been a bit weird for my coworkers when I came back heavily sedated. I think I was on 10mg zyprexa at the time. They knew something had happened to me, but nobody asked about it. It was tough being there pretending like it was business as usual."

176081180,The medication helped. Without it i don’t think i would be able to navigate the world like i do now.
174362674,Just make sure to keep doc posted on any big decisions about meds. Quitting meds is dangerous and you need to do it supervised.
176081181,I went to the doctor got tests results back. I dont have diabetes like she thought but my complete blood cell count was high. They asked questions said if headaches and dizziness gets worse they will schedule me in. Um now the hard part…I’ve been struggling to get _NAME_ healthy again. He ate maybe 4 worms since april useto eat 6 a week. I took him to the vet when I finally found a reptile vet that would see him and his kidneys shut down he passed away last night.

176081184,"25 years. _PERSON_, that’s right. In 1990 I was hospitalized several times probably partially due to my drug use and stress. They were only 2-5 days each. Then I stayed out but in 2015 my mom died. The stress of driving 150 miles by myself to see her last days was pretty bad. But I would do it again any time in that situation. I got back but just two days later I felt suicidal and my ex-brother-in-law drove me to the psyche ward. He had entered the picture when he married my sister in about 2008. This was long after my most tumultuous years when crisis’s were common. So he had never seen me in bad shape so I don’t know if this last time freaked him out or not. So yeah, it was only for two days."
176081185,"I’ve been like this as long as I can remember. Delusions, hallucinations, imaginary friends that wouldn’t go away. Everything really came to a head when I was about 19, That was the first time I was hospitalized and put on APs."

176081186,I don’t think watching porn while in a relationship is adultery. To me that’s like saying reading a romance novel is cheating. However it is important to discuss with your partner what you’re comfortable with. As for men being more sexual that’s not really true either it’s actually a pretty harmful stereotype. Also your reaction shouldn’t be wanting to hurt your husband for something like that. Being sexual and having urges isn’t something to hurt someone over. Most of the time people watch porn for the fantasy of it. So it’s not really a question of being enough… In the occasions I …indulge… I actually normally imagine doing the things I see with my partner.
176081187,LS! So if you are a male in the Western World your chances of making it past sixty are only 50%. Once you are there your chances of getting dementia within the next five years are almost 30%. That is not much of a perspective.
176081188,Hmm They gave me Risperdal in the hospital and I had eyelid twitches but I don’t mind if it stops the negative and cognitive symptoms. My pdoc said there is no perfect med for SZ.

174362675,I think it depends on locality for sure. My shrink in the states wanted to say I was sz affective because I have a serious mood disorder in major depression… Over here in Australia I’m paranoid sz and that suits me. I think for our part of the world sz aff is more with depression and mania. I don’t really get mania so I relate more to paranoid sz and major depression… I know that is getting semantic but paranoid sz is different to my major depression!

176081194,"When you get an intrusive thought you think of consequences of it if you not do the compulsion behavior like checking, redoing etc. Now what you need to do instead is think of the consequences if you went along with compulsion, intrusive thought etc. Yes you need to again respond like this when next intrusive thought come and think of what you are becoming if respond like this every time, how your life get so complicated, it increases anxiety, depression and many others."

176081196,Just re-read the article d = 0.31 so it’s neither small nor medium. It means that you are 0.3 standard worse over span of 20 years e.g. by age of 50. Not so bad actually. And agrees with what _AT_MENTION_ trying to say here. TL; DR: As far as I understood in twenty years you are 0.3 standard deviations behind the normal aging Bad news but bearable again But I definitely will go after sodium benzoate after this (I’m 30 now) and will continue to hope that they will invent something when I’m going to be aged 50.

176081307,Mesolimbic activaton causes anger is my theory. I notice it in my daily life an angry feeling. Like i had to catch a bus yesterday i almost never do and both there and back the anger was huge i was feeling. I cant stand other humans. The train is OK and good but the bus is disgusting all packed in listening to their filfh and having to get off the bus sooo quickly otherwise the bus driver complains. Everyone thanks the bus driver like a ??????. I have caught buses like a 1000 times in the past year or so but i did something radical i stopped catching buses 100% for many months now over 6 months probably. I walk everywhere and only catch trains. This is seriously radical all to avoid other humans. After yesterday I wont even use the bus for that location again. Almost no scenarios where i need a bus
176081308,I have been four times that I can remember but my wife always tells me it was seven. I think it was only four but I have been to day treatment a lot too. Once I was in day treatment for six weeks straight. We just watched a lot of movies. They ran out of stuff for us to do. It is what it is. If you need it’s good it’s there.
176081309,I get this. I wish I could show my muscular dystrophy and not give a ???? about what others think. I can’t. People ask me millions of questions such as “did you get hurt?” and worst of all “wtf happened”

174362715,"I think it’s natural to think about how family played a part in depression and schizophrenia. I too have thought maybe if I had different parents or parents who raised me differently I wouldn’t be struggling with schizophrenia, no energy, a job i hate, and always being alone. I agree it is completely messed up and unfair how people stigmatize people with schizophrenia in this society. as if it’s anyone’s fault that they have schizophrenia! most people don’t understand that it’s not as simple as choosing to have more energy or pushing past someone. It’s a real serious illness. I also experienced people showing their true colors when I was first diagnosed. It was hurtful how I felt so abandoned by so many people. It’s sad that people react like that, and I’m so sorry for what you’ve gone through. It’ a hard illness to deal with and gets unfairly stigmatized, but you are not garbage at all. it’s something additional that we deal with that other people can’t understand, but we 
are worth something"
176081321,I agree. VA healthcare is great. I don’t have anything negative to say.
174362706,"I strongly believe that religion is a man-made concept to explain away the unexplainable, with its roots grounded in mental illness. For example, the rosary: you say a prayer while counting a certain number of beads… Does that not have OCD undertones to it? It reminds me of those peeps who have to check their door locks a certain number of times so nothing bad happens to their loved ones. I’m sorry religion has caused you and other members so much distress, _AT_MENTION_. Good on you for abstaining from the triggering stuff. You’re on the path to recovery and that’s awesome."

176081326,"How is dieting going? Im not feeling great (pms), but still no sugar. I did eat a bit of bread because i needed to for a test. Im discovering recipes that son enjoys (sugarfree, glutenfree buckwheat pancakes with strawberries today, vegetable “penne” with fish, tomato sauce and basil, grapefruit as a snack) and new comfort foods (apple with 100% peanut butter, porridge, hot chocolate with pure cocoa and oat milk).

176081334,"You dont suck at life. I dont know the full situation, but i think that is pretty weird behaviour of your treatment team to talk about instead of with you. I could have responded the same. Perhaps they will still respond. Perhaps they wont and it is necessary to seek other treatment. I would find it strange of them. It is not as if you were aggressive or otherwise acting bad. You had a response to something that actually does seem unkind of them. Perhaps they will respond after the weekend still!"

176081344,I know for me when I was unmedicated my life was based upon the fact the corona virus was planted by the government to kill us all. Now that I’m medicated I can see how silly that is. Kinda. Wearing a mask in public bothers me. It makes me feel like I’m a robber. Kind of puts me on edge. I’m just wondering if anyone else is affected by the corona virus?
176081345,Don’t quit. They might have posted that looking for additional help. You just said you worked out the problems. Maybe she just realizes you need an extra person to help with tasks.
176081346,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I’ve been on Lamictal before and it makes me manic and anxious. Can’t be on that one.

176081351,If you needed the medication… Sure But I’ve been doing better without it so far I will keep you updated if anything changes The biggest obstacle is mood And also learning to keep my stress levels down I find a routine helps a lot with both of those

176081356,"i was naturally under weight until I got to my 40’s. people always used to compliment me on my slimness. but i always felt ugly, badly proportioned and unattractive. being slim doesn’t ensure you feel good about your appearance. I always had low self-esteem and poor body image. i compared myself to models in fashion magazines & in the media. I’ve put on weight with ap’s and now feel fat & unattractive. I went out last night & had to wear a frock as it was so hot & felt really unattractive."

176081371,Sorry that you’re suffering so much at the moment _AT_MENTION_ . It sounds horrible and scary. I hope the forum is some support for you right now. You sound like you may be quite unwell - do you have any treatment for your mental health?
176081372,I have major depressive disorder. I’m on Cymbalta 120mg (highest dose) for my anti-depressant. My mood stabilizer is Depakote 500mg. Both work well for me. Maybe you could talk to your pdoc about these two meds? Keep trying new meds until you find what works for you. I know it’s so hard but it will happen for you. I’m sorry you’re going through all of this. I feel your pain.

176081384,Maybe you could use them to make a better life for yourself with the right treatment. If you don’t get stuck in it. I think psychosis fixed something in me that I only realized when I came through it.

So no worries .
176081388,No medications. No call from psychiatrist. I’m feeling quite panicky and hallucinating a bit. I had plans inwas really excited for and had to cancel. Big sad. Wish it wqs easier to get help. Sorry for the vent !!! not sure what to do and im feeling edgy like something bad is gonna happen

All I want to say is stop!"
176081396,Exercising and doing better with that. Trying to add watching a movie and something different to my days. I’m getting there. Have a few hobby things on the go and been painting some plastic kits I’ve built. Still so many to go but I’m improving… I’m trying to do one positive thing a day at least. That means something different in exercise or hobby or leisure like watching a series or movie…I’m big on improving at the moment…otherwise it’s all the same and I miss family and friends and catching up. Already missed my nieces first birthday and other family things. Missed the friends catch up on this months wed adventure club.

Now that the Zyprexa is helping me, the agoraphobia is well controlled. I would say gone, but I know it would come back pronto if I stopped Zyprexa. I didn’t find DBT particularly helpful, just somewhat, but someone else might really benefit from it, so I wanted to share those two resources."

The morning is the hardest part of the day for me since I take drugs in the evening before bed they are potent in the morning, but the day gets better in the evening when the drugs are weening off. If you are stable on 7.5mg that’s good. It is little compared to what many others have to take. Don’t give up on life because of the drugs. Life is ever changing. You could get better at some point and manage with less drugs. It’s not impossible to get drug free at some point either. Also they might develop better drugs with less side effects in the future.

If I think back to the first couple years after my psychotic break, I can remember being frightened of my thoughts and doing this very consciously. Now it’s been a little while and maybe I’ve forgotten that I’m doing it because now I’m just used to it. I can imagine believing in something like a spirit portal before my psychotic break, but only because I would enjoy believing in it and it really would be of no consequence. Now it would just be terrifying. I hope this is not a distressing belief for you."

176081616,"I am working on a specialized therapy for people with psychosis. Sometime during my PhD I’d like to practice this for my research project and maybe establish a new, evidence based therapy for psychosis since like…only one exists and its just a modified form of CBT. This one would be specifically made for people with psychosis. The first part of it is recognizing the different phases of mental illness in my opinion. Phase 1 is denial. The person does not and will not recognize they have an issue. They are not open to or cooperative with treatment. Phase 2 is questioning. The person begins to question themselves and wonder if they do have an issue. The individual becomes open to treatment, but may quit it a number of times as they waver back and forth between believing they have an illness and not believing. This is a key phase in the recovery process and in my opinion the most difficult to reach. Phase 3 is recovery oriented, where the person acknowledges and fully accepts they have a mental ill
ness and becomes dedicated to recovery from that illness, and is fully cooperative with treatment. I want to understand more about what helps individuals move from phase 1 to phase 2. This is so,so important because as long as they are in that denial phase, they will never make progress, and will likely just be in and out of hospitals forever, or just in the hospital permanently. To me right now I can’t find any pattern other than people just seem to become aware on their own time, and others never seem to become aware at all. My own case sheds no light on the answer because for the whole first part of my life until age 16 there was no way anyone could have convinced me that I was delusional and had an illness. Just no way. Any logical reason given my brain could find a way around. And then magically, at age 16 I just began questioning it finally once a friend pointed it out to me. But before that if people said I was crazy or just made fun of me I just thought they didnt understand because they hadn’t ex
perienced what I had. So why was it at that particular time I was able to say “well why haven’t any of my beliefs come true yet? What if I’m just sick?” I have no idea. Please share your experiences of how and when you first gained insight so I can see if theres a pattern! summary : I am trying to find out if there is some key or pattern to developing insight into your condition, please share your experience of how you developed insight into your illness"

176081618,Looking good matey. I’m early in but doing more reps/less weights to get a bit of tone. I do a bit of body weight but looking to do more. It’s so good for you to get fit and with minimum outcome you can really take it far. I’ve got some free weights and some miscellany and doing really well with it. Toning up and actually putting on some muscle. If your doing it. Do the research and do it properly. Do the protein intake and excercise and there’s plenty of help on the net. I’ve got some really good workouts of pinterest. Great resource. Well done you!

I don’t get enough sleep because I am constantly dealing with my dad’s and wife’s health problems.

If you aren’t getting enough sleep though I have found it’s almost impossible to restrict your calories much. It’s good to start with myfitnesspal… I used it for two and a half years straight and learned a lot about my eating habits.

It’s all gone now, I was on on 1mg but still got it. 1.5mg, still got a mild case. Upped my dose to 2mg and I haven’t had akathisia since, praying that I won’t ever again. It was kind of frustrating because my Dr. didn’t think it was clozapine induced and thought it was stress / anxiety. Did some research, tried propranolol but didn’t work for me, benztropine has been great. Just letting you know my clozapine dose is 400mg. Just wanted to share this information, for anyone who might be going through this right now."
176081622,Yes that’s supposed to be the case.
176081623,yeah how long have you been off?? There is a “honeymoon” period coming off meds where side effects go away but there is still enough of the med in your system to prevent you from getting symptoms. 2 weeks to a month or so after quitting the meds fully leave your system and it results in a crash worse than your normal episodes. Trust me I’ve been through it a LOT. Always felt amazing coming off my meds then bam crazy town. If you have been off for much longer than that though like 6 months at least with no issues than that is great!

Genetics, Apr 2020 To investigate the genetic contribution to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the phenotypic and genetic associations between ALS and psychiatric and cardiovascular disorders (CVD) we used the national registry data from Denmark linked to first-degree relatives to estimate heritability and cross-trait parameters.ALS cases and 100 sex and birth-matched controls per case from the Danish Civil Registration System were linked to their records in the Danish National Patient Registry. Cases and controls were compared for (1) risk of ALS in first-degree relatives, used to estimate heritability, (2) comorbidity with psychiatric disorders and CVD, and (3) risk of psychiatric disorders and CVD in first-degree relatives.5,808 ALS cases and 580,800 controls were identified. Fifteen percent 
of cases and controls could be linked to both parents and full siblings, whereas 70% could be linked to children. (1) We estimated the heritability of ALS to be 0.43 (95% CI, 0.34-0.53). (2) We found increased rates of diagnosis of mental disorders (risk ratio = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.29) and CVD in those later diagnosed with ALS. (3) In first-degree relatives of those with ALS, we found increased rate of schizophrenia (1.17; 95% CI, 0.96-1.42), but no evidence for increased risk CVD.Heritability of ALS is lower than commonly reported. There is likely a genetic relationship between ALS and schizophrenia, and a nongenetic relationship between ALS and CVD."

Get creative and find your favorite side dishes too that you can cook and freeze. As to snacking, do you snack from vending machines or at home? Because what you snack on at home is totally under your control. Just keep fruit or yogurt around. Or crackers without too much fat. Or plain popcorn. Or vegetables like carrots or celery that you can dip in non fat ranch dressing.

I mourn his suffering as it mirrors my own. I had intense delusions and nobody stuck around… I’m a devout Buddhist. but as nearly all monasteries are closed for residential stays, I feel the need to do the practice of asceticism. If I die in the woods, it would be ok, and only I would truly understand the wisdom in that type of life. others, as it is today very fashionable, would think I was deluded and didn’t understand what I was doing.

176081723,"Hi all. I thought I’d share the time I went in the run from the _NAME_ from mental hospital, for anyone that’s interested or bored. For some context, I was hearing intelligent real peoples voices, having conversations, apart of a narrative that I had to go on the run or join the _NAME_ because the same voices told me secrets of the _NAME_ nobody knew. Anyway after a few months I ended up in hospital, didn’t tell the doctors anything about just that I was hearing neighbours commenting. They had no idea how deep I was in it. Anyway I was in the ward called the drop down ward or ward your in before you go into the general ward. It’s high security. I was allowed out for walks around the hospital but couldn’t leave, and had to get permission to leave the ward. The doors would lock on closing and could only be opened by the staff at the desk. After mentioning my old work colleagues daughter name in my head by impulse, (I was so afraid of doing it) I decided I would go on the run because I thoug
ht I was in too much trouble. _PERSON_ I almost completed suicide for the same reason. Anyway I had my bags packed and all I had to do was get them out of the ward. My room was luckily beside the door so I had full view of who was coming in and out. And there was a pillar blocking the desk so I could stand at my door watching the door. The door was in view of the desk so I had to time it properly so they wouldn’t see me throw the bags out out the door. My plan was to throw the bags out first and then go out separately. The thing about that was I had to wait until someone left from the ward then stop the door from closing fully. So someone left one time and I jammed the door with a shoe I think stopping it from closing and I wasn’t seen because of the pillar. Anyway I checked the desk and waited for them to walk away, I also had to keep any eye on the outside to make sure no one came into the ward. Anyway the coast was clear so I quickly threw my three bags out the door. I then beckoned at the desk after s
omeone came back, to go out for a walk and I went out. Thankfully no one noticed my bags outside the door and the it was very quiet. I grabbed my bags quickly and ran and put them under the stairs where they wouldn’t be noticed. (Becuase I was gonna wait until the morning to go) it was common at the time to see bags under the stairs. Anyway I went back to the ward, I think someone doing the rounds noticed my bags gone but I just said they had brought washing home for me. The next day I got ready and went out and arranged a taxi from the computer room on one of my walks. I grabbed my bags and walked through the hospital to the entrance. Nobody looked twice at me, they probably thought I was leaving because I was discharged. I decided to get the bus because it came very close just down the road from the hospital. Anyway I was hearing provo leader _NAME_ and he was talking and conversing with me as I was standing at the door of the airport bus deciding what to do, hesuddenly shouted ‘GO ON THE RUN’ so that 
pushed me to get on. Continued conversing with me as I was in the bus and got to the airport. I was undecided at this point whether to go to London or Edinburgh. I asked _NAME_ where I should I go but then _NAME_ took on _NAME_’s voice. One was saying London and the other was saying Edinburgh. One _NAME_ said there was more provos in London so I went with London Ok I have confused it again, the last paragraph was when I actually went through with it il go over what happened the other times at the end. I was hearing _NAME_ and _NAME_ throughout my time at the airport, got to the boarding que and there were several monitors and I thought _NAME_ and _NAME_ could see me then. I b fan to cry to let them know I was disappointed I was leaving. Can’t remember all of what they were saying. Anyway flash to the plane and I was in the air and still hearing them. _NAME_ was surprised that I was still hearing their voice in the air and _NAME_ was just being _NAME_. Also _NAME_ told me there was a provo on the plain wit
h me and also someone from the _NAME_, I had suspicions they were in the que also but I tried not to look.Anyway we landed and _NAME_ said among other things that ‘Iv made it to the land of the oppressor’ _NAME_ thought the voices would stop as he had agreed with _NAME_ that I would stop hearing voices on arrival in London (one of the reasons I went) _NAME_ said that I would be better off joining the provos and going home. But I decided to stay. Oh yeah went to collect my bag was still hearing _NAME_ and _NAME_ the whole time, I noticed _NAME_ talking to someone and asking them if I was walking ‘heavy’ I seen a guy on the phone who looked like a provo and thought that was him, _NAME_ kept telling me not to look at anybody and keep the head down. So that’s what I did. Anyway got the bus to Liverpool Street and it was dark at this time. The voices had stopped for a few minutes while I was in the que for the bus. Just when I thought they were gonna let me be in peace _NAME_ comes and says ‘did you sa
y did you think we were gonna leave you alone. _NAME_ had left at this point and I was hearing _NAME_ and _NAME_. Got off the bus with my bags at Liverpool Street and _NAME_ was still talking and asked in a funny way where are you gonna stay you idiot (because I had no where booked) _NAME_ and _NAME_ were continually talking I could only remove that bit. Started walking around with my bags and noticed two _NAME_ people walking by me as they do . I also noticed a provo who said ‘what are you doing begs’ at this point I thought the _NAME_ were around and also provos. Went to a bank that I thought was hotel and he pointed me to some hotel down in an ally. Went to that hotel noticed the same guys walking by me and two others at the door. They were booked out. Eventually stumbled upon this aparthotel and booked a room. Got to my room and barricaded the doors with the couch. Was still hearing _NAME_ and _NAME_ throughout, one thing I remember is _NAME_ saying the provos are out in force tonight. Oh yeah before 
I ended up in that hotly I actually flagged a taxi and went to some hotel he suggested but it was booked out as well, noticed a black guy at the door staring at me, _NAME_ let me know they used the blacks as spotters as well. Anyway I tried falling asleep but was still hearing _NAME_ and _NAME_, _NAME_ had told me he was going to put a suicide curse on me but it would only work when I fell (the next morning I would kill myself) at this point I could see him in my minds eye sitting beside me staring at me as I fell asleep. Got up the next morning and was grand, wasn’t hearing any voices so I decided to go out for some breakfast. Found this shity place and got some pancakes, also had the nicest cup of tea!!! Anyway just as I was eating my pancakes _NAME_ comes back talking away about something the situation can’t remember everything. I decide to get another kickass cup of tea from the place next door and go and sit at this restaurant seating area outside. _NAME_ came back as well and _NAME_ began to get rea
lly bad. The talking was just so constant and fast I couldn’t function it was relentless. I went back to my apartment which I had checked out of now, so I just sat on the stairs. At this point the voices were really bad I mean really really bad, so loud and relentless. I thought well they not leaving me alone so I might as well go home. I decided to give it another night and see so I booked into another room. Got the room and barricade myself in once again, I was hearing _NAME_ and _NAME_ throughout. I remember being on the couch in a lot a lot of pain trying not to insult or say anything wrong to the voices specifically _NAME_. He said he would punish me greatly for anything I said and I believed everything because it was just so realistic. I grinder my teeth repeating the same thing in my head over and over, ‘no IRAs family should ever be mentioned’ and I was also hearing provo _NAME_ now ‘and I repeated the same thing ‘’no provos family should ever be mentioned!’ This went on for hours until 
I made a deal with them that I could get something to drink so they allowed me make a cup of tea. The same thing went on for more hours until midnight came and I eventually insulted _NAME_’s family and _NAME_’s so I decided I was going to commit suicide. I rang 999 and told them this and they sent me a taxi to come to the hospital. As I went down to get the taxi _NAME_ was telling me not to go out side, shouting at me to get in it wasn’t safe. I went out to find my taxi in a panic and hopped in it was parked in an alleyway of course. Got to the hospital and was being signed in and confessed to the registrar that I was on leave from a mental hospital. Any way was still hearing _NAME_ and _NAME_ the whole time. Got to this waiting room with a padded couch and they gave me some blankets. _NAME_ was trying to convince _NAME_ to turn off the voices which he did after a while allowing me to sleep. Got awoken at 7 in the morning in a hungover kind of state and they had sent the mental health nurse to talk to m
e. She told me why would I leave hospital and told me she got in touch with st pats to let them know I was in London. I never told them I was hearing voices or anything just that I was suicidal. I knew they wouldn’t believe me that the voices were real. Went back to the apartment and fell asleep and got a call from my ward asking why I was in London, they told me to come back immediately and that I was in their care and I shouldn’t be overseas. I can’t remember much of the next day only that I went back continually hearing voices. I would’ve stayed had the voices stopped. _NAME_ said on the bus on the way to the airport ‘the lads putting too much pressure on ya’ after I decided to go home. To cut an even longer story short; continued hearing voices _NAME_ told me go home PRovo indicating that I now had to join the provos and nearly opened the emergency exit on the plane _NAME_’s voice on the plane was very scary and relentless and the whole way back. Heart was beating out of my chest when I got 
home and got through baggage’s reclaim. The _NAME_ had sent someone to meet me at the arrivals gate but I just avoided them. I was continually hearing _NAME_ and ownie at this time and they were telling me I was going to be murdered but _PERSON_ said he’d sent a provo to protect me, and also told me to avoid any _NAME_ taxis. Anyway went outside to get a taxi and seen that same provo bodyguard that I seen in my hometown running by me (this is one of the reasons I think it was real. Anyway got back to the hospital voices stopped and I fell asleep Things are kinda getting confused here because I went on the run about four times but only actually got on the plane one time."

176081724,"the Guardian – 21 Feb 20 UN warns of rise of 'cybertorture' to bypass physical ban Rapporteur warns against trivialising psychological torture as states exploit internet to target individuals Psychological torture is being exploited by states to circumvent the more widely understood ban on physically inflicting pain and may open the way to a future of “cybertorture”, the UN torture rapporteur has said. _PERSON_, professor of international law at the University of Glasgow and the UN’s special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, is cautioning that the internet could be used systematically to target individuals remotely – through “intimidation, harassment, surveillance, public shaming and defamation”. A trenchant critic of the UK government’s failure to hold an inquiry into the rendition of jihadi suspects post-9/11, _PERSON_ has also voiced concerns over Britain’s treatment of the WikiLeaks founder _NAME_ in Belmarsh prison. Sign up 
for the Guardian documentaries update Read more Later this month the professor, who is Swiss, will present a report to the UN human rights council in _NAME_ highlighting his concern over “continuing development of psychological tortures and legal misconceptions about what conduct is prohibited by international treaty”. His comments coincide with the UK release of a documentary, Eminent Monsters: A Manual for Modern Torture, which investigates covert CIA funding in the 1950s of techniques developed by the Scottish-born psychiatrist Dr _NAME_. The documentary, directed by the Bafta-winning film-maker _NAME_, shows how patients were subjected to sensory deprivation, forced comas, LSD injections, and extreme physical and mental torture at a Canadian research establishment run by _NAME_. Those techniques, the documentary claims, were forerunners of methods used on the so-called “hooded men” who were subjected to white noise, put in stress positions, threatened and deprived of sleep, food and water, and bea
ten after being arrested during internment in Northern Ireland in 1971. Similar techniques were later inflicted by US forces on jihadi suspects detained in Guantánamo Bay. In a 2018 judgment after the hooded men case was reopened, the European court of human rights reaffirmed that abuse of the 14 men almost 50 years before amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment, but did not constitute torture. That distinction, _PERSON_ argues, is wrong. “Judges think that physical torture is more serious than cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment,” he told the Guardian. “Torture is simply the deliberate instrumentalisation of pain and suffering.” Consequently psychological torture methods are often used “to circumvent the ban on torture because they don’t leave any visible marks”. In his UN report, _PERSON_ points out that many countries “deny, neglect, misinterpret or trivialise psychological torture as what could be euphemistically described as ‘torture light’, whereas ‘real torture’ is stil
l predominantly understood to require the infliction of physical pain or suffering. “Some states have even adopted national definitions of torture excluding mental pain or suffering, or interpretations requiring that in order to constitute torture, mental pain or suffering must be caused by the threat or infliction of physical pain or suffering, threats of imminent death, or profound mental disruption.” Many countries have invested “significant resources towards developing methods of torture which can achieve purposes of coercion, intimidation, punishment, humiliation or discrimination without causing readily identifiable physical harm or traces”, _PERSON_ states. “Some of these approaches have resurfaced most prominently in connection with interrogational torture in the context of counter-terrorism, ‘deterrence’-based detention of irregular migrants, alleged mass-internment for purposes of political ‘re-education’, and the abuse of individual prisoners of conscience.” An alarming developm
ent that Melzer contemplates is “cybertorture”. States, corporate actors and organised criminals, he says, “not only have the capacity to conduct cyber-operations inflicting severe suffering on countless individuals, but may well decide to do so for any of the purposes of torture. “Cybertechnology can also be used to inflict, or contribute to, severe mental suffering while avoiding the conduit of the physical body, most notably through intimidation, harassment, surveillance, public shaming and defamation, as well as appropriation, deletion or manipulation of information. “Already harassment in comparatively limited environments can expose targeted individuals to extremely elevated and prolonged levels of anxiety, stress, social isolation and depression, and significantly increases the risk of suicide. “Arguably, therefore, much more systematic, government-sponsored threats and harassment delivered through cybertechnologies not only entail a situation of effective powerlessness, but may well inflic
t levels of anxiety, stress, shame and guilt amounting to ‘severe mental suffering’ as required for a finding of torture.” In his UN report _PERSON_ pays tribute to Eminent Monsters for showing “the origins and devastating effects of contemporary psychological torture”. Such experiments, he added, should be prevented in future. Of the UK government’s decision last year not to hold a judicial inquiry into post-9/11 rendition, _PERSON_ told the Guardian: “I’m very worried. The convention against torture requires it. That refusal sets an example that we don’t really have to investigate and prosecute.” Since you’re here … … joining us from Poland, we have a small favour to ask.

176081740,Has anyone else had that problem?
176081741,Feeling manic the last couple weeks. Can’t sleep. Eating lucky charms marshmallows and honey toast. This cannot be healthy.
176081742,Have you tried to meditate ? or deep breathing exercise ?
176081743,"Off meds, I get stuck or more inside my head. I have really more bizarre thoughts, zone out completely where I don’t pay attention to other people, and I get down the conspiracy rabbit hole. I also tend to say or think more outlandish things. I don’t hallucinate though. I don’t think the meds are making me not work (quite the opposite) but maybe the damage is already done from the meds? I don’t know. I’m more pro-meds now since I found Vraylar than I was when I was on the other meds. I tend to get more confused and live and breath conspiracies. I tend to think I’m getting insight or messages but it just ends up confusing me or ends up being disinformation. That’s why I need meds. I really wish I could lose the weight but it doesn’t help that I eat crappy foods and drink sugary drinks."
176081744,I love stuff like that
176081745,"Cool Poem _AT_MENTION_. Nothing Wrong With Taking A Quick Break From The Sometimes Chaotic Mess Of A World Slowly Devouring Upon Itself To Watch The Hounds Laugh At The Misfortune Brought On From Those Endlessly Devouring On Meaninglessness. It’s A Sad, Sad Tale Of Jealousy, Spite, Hatred, And Mindless Self Indulgence. No Secret On That Last Sentence. Maybe A Quick Early Easter Egg Hunt!. N e Hoo. Long Moons Ago, I Discovered Poetry And Ended Up Trying My Own Modest Attempt. And Had Not A Clue If It Was Good, Bad, Or Indifferent. In The End I Got Some Feedback And It Was Positive. So I Began My Search For Understanding In Writing More Poetry. Which Led To Song’s. And Then!, I Even Tried Writing Scripts!. I’m Slightly Wandering But!, Keep At It. It’s Fun To Let Go, And Discover Your True Potential At Possibly Breaking Down Inner Barriers Of Psychological Standing. And!, Better Yourself In The Long Run. Plus, It’s Never Too Late To Try Something New!."
176081746,"Do you mean like an advocacy group? I do think vulnerable people need allies. I have felt mismanaged in the mental health system, and it’s made me angry sometimes."
176081747,I’ve spoken 3 times with my psychiatrist over the phone for a consultation since _PERSON_. Next appointment next week is back in person. Glad to hear all is well.
176081748,"I am currently very overweight with a terrible diet, no exercise routine to speak of, sub par hygiene practices and am terrible about keeping my apartment clean too. For obvious reasons I’d like to change this. I am excellent about creating plans to do so. I make plans that in my eyes are extremely doable and realistic, like take a 15-30 min walk at the end of the day, or brush my teeth every night, cook at least 3 times a week, etc. But then when it comes to actually following through with those plans I never even start. I go to work, come back extremely drained and go into my same old pattern of ordering fast food and playing videogames until bedtime. Any and all motivation I had to change goes out the window because of how tired I am. How do I get past this hump? I’ve honestly been looking for new jobs because I feel this one has had such a profoundly negative impact on my life. But being in the psych field any job I find is going to be a lot to handle really."
176081749,"I fixed mine yesterday. Went to bed at 5.30pm, got up at 3 am, and had breakfast at 4am. It’s 4:35am right now. Now I can go to bed at 12am tonight and wake at 8 or 9 am tomorrow."

176081751,I’m diabetic and haven’t checked my blood sugar levels in weeks. I’m going to check it today.
176081752,"Well, mental illness is not a phase. You learn how to cope with it, but you can never get rid of it. So no, I dont really see myself leaving."
176081753,Thank you! I’m really glad I joined
176081754,Thanks I don’t know what to do. Have people really mean it what they say just want a normal life.
176081755,"Yes, I thought so too. It was to prove myself that I do not have SZ or mental disorder. But the fact that I’m having suicidal thoughts is leading me somewhere else so I wanted answers. It was tiring at first (I’ve decided to record my experience way back when it is still fresh (the broadcasting thing) and I was panicking a lot since I had no one to believe me! It was frustrating! But now I am able to test my theories, to prove myself otherwise. I’m recording my experience via my mobile phone because what happens to me, I’m only attacked with voices when I’m alone in a public place. When I’m with someone else and I get distracted, I can sense that they’re still there but subtle. It is more louder when I’m alone. Also, I try to find the source where it is coming from but only to fail due to the crowd larger than me. Anyway, what I’m hearing most of the time are usually repetition of what I’m thinking atm or how my life has been. When I’m reminiscing about a sad memory, someone b
y my side would coincidentally say something similar. I mean who wouldn’t question their own sanity if you heard someone repeat what you just thought especially for someone you just passed by and barely knew? It’s like my mind is an open book and I cannot control it. Well, that’s how I’ve been feeling."
174362798,"Abilify, Lamotragine, thyroxine and metformin. I hear mumbling in background noise - especially background TV, radio and music. they are sending me special messages, but I can’t make out what they are. I don’t think I’ve ever had a proper auditory hallucination. These are in my head."
176081756,"I pick my scalp pretty bad, So I know how bad the compulsion is and how difficult it is to heal or see any progress. I don’t know if this will help you, But I use apple cider vinegar as a final rinse and, I swear, overnight, it helps clean up and heal some of my wounds. Of course, they’re real crunchy and perfect for picking the next day, so that’s a challenge, But it does help heal up and clean, I think. I have no science to back up what I’m telling you, It’s just my experience."

176081764,"I had problems socializing since I was about 13 years old. I remember being alone at school with no one to talk to. At about 20 years old I had severe depression which never got treated, for about 4 years. I was failing miserably in school and I didn’t see any future. Then for about a year I did everything I could, like writing letters and being evaluated, to get into psychoanalysis. I was trying to convince myself I needed it. This drove me deep into self criticism. So there were stresses. I sunk into psychosis at about age 25. But really I blame the biology."
174362807,Only take 1 capsule per day. Dose they say is incorrect one is more than enough. Try buying other supplements like DMG 125 mg or omega 3 to make up that shipping cost.
176081765,"It is very difficult. My mother was abused as a child, and back in those days there was no help for you. I think you are going about dealing with the abuse in the right way. Counselling and some self-reflection goes a long way. It is possible to move on but it isn’t easy. I’m sorry that you went through this as a child. I hope you find some inner peace soon."
176081766,It took me years. I got sick in 2008 and came here in 2014. That’s how long it took me to figure it out. Once you are here I think you have figured it out. I was locked in a room in a hospital on suicide watch and hallucinated all kinds of crazy stuff. That was in 2012. First I thought somebody slipped me some drugs but then I started piecing things together. When I got a letter from the VA in 2013 that said I was 100% disabled veteran. Permanent and totally disabled that gave me more of a clue. I quit my job I was working at the time but it still took me another year to be convinced.

176081773,It’s nuanced. Negatives are both psychological and physiological. A person can overcome negatives with sheer force of will sometimes. APs definitely help though.
174362805,Both I wouldn’t mind if the espresso feeling was less (which might happen the longer I take it). But I’m happy with the mood lift. But I never expected to feel anything this soon. _USER_ID_ something this dramatic! I’ll definitely continue taking it.

174362810,"Oh yeah, theres also psychotic depression."
176081791,"Called the emergency this evening. I was suicidal The person answering me, talked to me with a professionel attitude, like a robot trained in crises management. I said to her , bugger off. I don’t want no hospitalisation. Now i wait till my nurse or Pdoc calls me. They are human and not trained robots. I like them. They meet me in person, like a human, not some standard suicidal person."
174362809,Yes that’s exactly what I felt too …
176081792,Would be cool if its also Uber Eats and here in Canada. I would order everyday.
176081793,"The way we figure it, issues like erectile dysfunction caused by meds are not something that only happens after you turn 18. They are real medical issues and teenagers should have access to information about why they might be experiencing a problem. We don’t allow super explicit sex talk, but we do allow a healthy discussion of issues that can affect anyone."
176081794,anyone have no med compliance /not taking any meds at all?
176081795,_AT_MENTION_ yes u are right … but he is challenging the system … he showed few of his hiv cured client… so dont be so negative… cuz he is travelling to U.s soon… And he said he will see popular face of america… _AT_MENTION_ ayurvedic is not limited to paceboos … So please wait this old man… He just want to share … He want show if U.s allows him to treat cancer patient and his formula works 100%… its a good sign for all the human beings .

176081799,"I think the best approach is to ignore anything that looks directed at you, instead of taking it too personal. That’s what I would do. Maybe they get tired of meme-harrassment eventually…"

176081801,I’m 56 I’m divorced I’m a sensitive person I am creative
174362812,I had a problem with it when I was on Saphris. It was terrifying and depressing. Especially since I read that it may never go away but thankfully it did. I would often turn my head which was beyond my control as well as other things. That and my hallucinations was just terrifying and made me more pyschotic. It was like something had control of my body. Thankfully it did go away after I got off that drug.
176081802,you did good thing calling her brother. It’s kinda hard that they expect you to handle that while you are sick yourself. It must be difficult situation for you =(
176081803,I’m good. Waiting to see my primary dr for a BP and diabetes checkup. My BP has been really good. I’ve been checking it at home. I’m hoping my A1C went down and I can get off at least one of my 2 diabetes meds.
176081804,"Well, tell them it’s not working and ask for a different med. For me, haldol and perphenazine worked wonders."
176081805,Are you abusing them?
176081806,I hardly use benzos (Clonazepam) or propranolol anymore as panic attacks are very rare now
176081807,I guess seeing the difference in taking meds made me realize something was wrong. I still find it hard to accept but I guess with any illness it is hard too.
176081808,"Thank you! _AT_MENTION_ Yes, they are"
176081809,_AT_MENTION_ Is there some way you could collate every short poem you’ve ever written on this forum? Could a Moderator do this? My sister is a writer…I’m sure she’d love to help you publish a book of your short poems!

174362817,"I was just feeling paranoid in general, and no with a particular thing. I took my Abilify this morning, and the paranoia is gone. I called to get an appointment with my pdoc to talk about it, but they haven’t called me back yet. I’m going to DFA to get an ID tomorrow since my pdoc didn’t call me back. I guess it’s going to be next week."

176081816,I don’t want to downplay others fears but I’m not even worried about it. I’m more worried about our economy failing because people aren’t out shopping. Yesterday when dad and I went to the grocery store all the restaurant parking lots were empty
176081817,Erotomania is a form of delusion. You believe in something not real.
176081818,I’ll ask her to speak to psychiatrist about it.
176081819,"Yeah all men get an erection usually while sleeping, they just dont realise it - otherwise the tissue would die off from lack of blood flow lol. Im sure getting one for sex is a different matter tho."
176081820,Geez. That sounds horrific. Your voices sound dangerous. Weren’t you on a med that blocked them? I remember you had to come off it though.
176081821,But I am not hungry and want to lose weight.
176081822,"I’m so sorry you feel disconnected from it all _AT_MENTION_ , its an awful feeling to be so isolated, even when you are surrounded by people who care. Please take care, and get a med adjustment for sure, I think that should help"

176081827,Probably lion tamer. At a young age I discovered I had a knack for teaching large predators neat tricks.
176081828,I have this belief that there are psychiatrists posing as forum members here. The psychiatrists can ask many questions and extrapolate the answers the psychiatrists receive from schizophrenics. To me this is okay since certain questions and scenarios will answer some hypothesis from psychiatrists that a direct one-on-one talk therapy couldn’t answer. What do you guys think?
174362822,I heard a strange voice today…after that it went quiet again

174362818,"I wonder if my negative symptoms can be treated by antidepressant. I’m taking agomelatine which is kinda work as new mechanisms treating depression. They say the difference between depression and negative symptoms is sadness, and I think I’m not sad to be diagnosed as depression."

176081841,How did you all get schizophrenia? I was a weed smoker and someone I trusted put fentanyl in my weed… it sucks can’t believe I might have to deal with this for the rest of my life.
174362823,Maybe you have simple schizophrenia. But you have positive symptoms: many intricate delusions. And some of them bizarre. Bizarre delusions are schizophrenia

I’m looking for something that isn’t front-line reception and is some kind of accounting clerk work. Office jobs usually do want to call references. I do have them, just from 2011 and prior.

very uncomfortable and even scary one time when i was driving, had to pull over and wait for it to pass. nowadays i dont take a oral pill to help with the wearing off i just tough it out. but perhaps you might be able to find an AP that will help you on your final week leading up to the shot that does not have any serious side effects."

176082122,"My first one ever. I’ve had a really really hard past couple of days, a lot of patients, many of which are very high acuity, very ill with a lot of behaviors, who don’t want to be in the hospital. This means many codes (which are stressful on their own), which means a lot of paperwork, on top of admissions I’ve had, discharges, orders, notes, assisting patients with things like getting their rent paid or getting meds for their aches or anxiety, talking on the phone with concerned family members who have a lot to get off their chest, etc. Just a LOT. Anyways at the end of yesterday I went in to ask if I could be put on a different unit the next day and ended up bursting into tears and realizing I probably just needed the entire next day off. My supervisors were very kind and concerned and said they had been amazed as a brand new nurse I hadn’t broken down earlier. One of my supervisors gave me a hug and told me every other day she drove home crying. Covid has been really really hard on our h
ospital. They told me to take a “mental health day” and get a massage or something to relax and rejuvenate before coming back my next shift. I am so grateful for them. I have felt myself becoming more and more burnt out lately and likely soon I will be needing an extended vacation. I’ll need to see how much pto I have.

Also traumas, abuse or anything like that, that suddenly gives the physical symptoms like in conversion disorder. In my country, klonopin is not considered first line treatment for anxiety. SSRI or SNRI like Cymbalta or Effexor is considered the best treatment for somatization / anxiety. I have a lot of MI issues right now, due to life circumstances, but somatization is not that big a thing, so it’s possible to at least get rid of that. AP’s might help, but only a doctor or skilled therapist might know that by hearing your story. Hope you and your body heal well."

176082126,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The revised Psychosis Attachment Measure: Measuring disorganized attachment. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The British journal of clinical psychologyReferences, May 2020 15 The Psychosis Attachment Measure (PAM) is currently the most widely used and validated measure of attachment in psychosis. However, the PAM does not assess disorganized attachment, the type of attachment that has been most closely linked with vulnerability to psychosis. This study aimed to expand the PAM to capture the concept of disorganized attachment and to examine its psychometric properties in a psychosis sample.Clinical and academic experts in the field of psychosis and service user representatives were asked to assess the comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of the pool of disorganized items. This process resulted in 12 items hypothesized to capture disorganized attachment that were included with the original items of the PAM. A sample of 144 individuals with either a self-reported diagn
osis of, or treatment for, a psychosis-related condition completed a battery of online measures comprising the revised PAM, existing measures of adult disorganized attachment and constructs hypothesized to be conceptually related to disorganized attachment.An exploratory factor analysis was conducted with three factors retained; these were labelled anxious, avoidant and disorganized attachment. The factors displayed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability and the disorganized factor displayed good construct validity with related measures and constructs.These results provide preliminary evidence that the revised PAM captures the concept of disorganized attachment. However, confirmatory psychometric evaluation of the revised PAM is required, within a separate psychosis sample, to confirm its factor structure. The relationship between these results and the current literature, in addition to the clinical and research implications, are discussed.We present an expanded version of the Psychosis Attachm
ent Measure (PAM), revised to capture the concept of disorganised attachment in adulthood. This expanded measure showed good reliability and the new disorganized subscale demonstrated construct validity. These results provide preliminary evidence that disorganized attachment can be measured using a simple self-report measure with individuals with psychosis. Further research is required to confirm the structural dimensionality of the revised PAM within a new sample using confirmatory factor analysis. Following further psychometric validation the use of this measure has the potential to be expanded to other mental health conditions in which disorganized attachment has been implicated in the development and maintenance of difficulties, for example, trauma-related conditions and borderline personality disorder."

I went to get an emergency evaluation and hallucinated a persons voice in the waiting room saying my mom was the cause of all my problems, and that i was a mad scientist. I waited for hours to be seen, and was put on abilify. The voices got progressively worse after the abilify and made me fear for my life"
174362893,The new pdoc gave you the sz diagnosis for sure?
174362890,"It used to be bad. I would sit for hours doing nothing and staring into space However over time with a chance of medication and an antidepressant added I enjoy things like video games, bored games , warhammer, painting. IT can get better but you have to motivate yourself."
176082133,"Ok, thank you.so maybe i suffer from derealization and thats why i have the feeling, that some things escape from my vision? I guess i make too many thoughts to myself in my head, no?"
176082134,"I too have trouble getting started sometimes. Last time I cleaned I took the time to see how long it would take to do things. It was really surprising how much cleaning I could get done in like half a hour. If I did that a few times each week that would probably be enough. I’m struggling right now, but I have plans to get into a rountine. Maybe set a fixed time of the day where I put in time to get the cleaning and tidying done."
176082135,"I have problems accepting that not all of my memories are real. I don’t know if I will ever truly get over them. Today I’m in doubt. An argument I’ve held since I was a teen consists of soul memories. We have our minds memory, we have instinct, we have muscle memory, why couldn’t a proverbial soul retain some form of memory? Things that have shaped it since it’s creation. I know I should blame the illness, and I know it’s not healthy to entertain thoughts like this. But I’m struggling. I have to actively tell myself that I’m not divine, that I’ve always been human, and this life is real. My memories don’t help, be they dream, vision, or thought. I can still feel my wings, restless ache from behind. I’ve seen gates, and fires, endless dusk, and eternal dawn. The planes, the elementals, the pillars, and the pit. I believe I’ve witnessed them all. I question sometimes why I stay here. Why I don’t just move on. I think it comes down to my loved ones, I do it for them. I feel s
o jaded to this life, nearly a contempt at times. If I didn’t have them…I wouldn’t want to be here. So, like the thing I am, I’ll rally once again, put on a brave face, smile, laugh, and pretend to be human, in some dismal effort to drink the kool-aide and fit in. All the while still harboring this weight. “An angel that commits an unforgivable sin, is cast down to a world of suffering, given one life.” Sigh. I’m not making a good case for my own sanity, am I? I think I’m just confused. May not of slept well. I know I’ve been taking my pills, I try to be very good about them. The Zyprexa really helps with the voices, but I still get the odd thoughts. Thank you for reading my aimless rant, I wish you all a good day."

Yes, I have experienced visual hallucinations, various self-disturbances and plenty of negative and cognitive symptoms. Apathy, lack of drive or motivation, depression, and memory and concentration problems."

A couple people from high school have tried to friend me on Facebook over the years, I accepted and they just asked questions they had no right to ask. So blocked 'em. One re-requested today, I’m debating cause her husband was her boyfriend in high school, and he beat on her then, and I know he still is, so I don’t want to get dragged into it again. I was the bad person for telling her that she deserved better and he was a piece of ???? even back then. But I can’t offer help if you’re gonna turn it around on me.

176082190,I wouldn’t say I was ashamed. When I was checked into my first psyche ward and I was sitting on my bed I distinctly remember thinking that I had crossed a line and I could never go back to normal life. I don’t feel ashamed about my 7 or 8 hospitalizations but I could see how someone might try to make me feel that way.
176082191,Pretty sure that’s included.

Back in October or November 2019 when I was in hospital I noticed peoples tongues flicking at the sides of their mouths. It’s not normal to do that. I’ve seen countless people doing it. I even do it sometimes. I feel like everyone is a reptilian and possibly a hive mind. I don’t want to dwell on this damn delusion."
176082194,Yes. They both stimulate and depress at the same time so the smoker feels depressed and anxious. Like all drugs they give a surge of short term neurotransmitters/hormones then the effect becomes less and less until the user is depressed

176082199,I don’t even know what my symptoms are at this point. I’ve been living away on my own in Asia for most of the last 8 years. I buy my medicine (Haldol) myself and determine my own doses. I have seen a doctor a couple times in the last eight years when I returned home to America. I have some bad periods but those seem to be mostly over. However I always feel that the illness is lurking underneath. It’s hard to describe what my symptoms are because I’ve been living a mostly normal life for so long now. However I always feel that I’m battling something. I wonder what would happen if I stopped medicine but I can’t take that risk now as I have a job teaching English. What do you guys think?

176082203,"I have banned myself from even thinking about anything spiritual or religious. When I was very ill, I thought I had stumbled across a new religious/spiritual awakening and I would not shut up about it. Anyway, that was the past. Now I am just going to wait until I die to see if it’s all true or not. If I am proven right or wrong, it won’t have mattered any way in the end as no one has the answer to that question… Try not to pre-occupy yourself with things like this, as it will take a toll on you. Best thing is to just live a good life as best as you can given your circumstances. It’s actually pretty easy to be a moral person without the religious element. Challenge all these thoughts you have. If you have a strong enough will and find your inner voice, you should be able to fight back with reason, at least that worked in my case."

174362910,"That’s awesome man. From what I gather your essentially trying to describe schizophrenia in real time. Seriously, your doing it well. The description definitely resonates with me. The only thing I would disagree with is describing the process as akin to or synonymous with anything similar to mindfulness. In pure psychosis there is no separation between your thoughts and your perception of reality. That’s why you would be described as delusional rather then paranoid or just a person with strange beliefs. Mindfulness or what your building with mindfulness is essentially the space between thoughts. Also maybe be a little more careful. I enjoyed what you said but it could trigger some folk."

The same hurt feelings bubble up when you are excluded from lunch with co-workers, fail to land the job you interviewed for or are dumped by a romantic partner. Rejection feels lousy.

176082227,Always important to continue the medication. Stopping or skipping doses doesn’t work well for your mind. Keep with your doctor and you need to take the meds everyday as prescribed. I’d say even to keep a certain time of the day to take them as routine helps.

176082241,"No, it doesn’t really make any sense to me. I get that that is the thought process behind it, I just think it’s ridiculous to so aggressively try to blame poor people for their problems (not pointing the finger at you - just to the problem in general). No one wants to be poor, and people who really need help shouldn’t be scrutized for how much they deserve to be helped. People who really need help deserve to be helped and shouldn’t have to lose their dignity for accepting that help. There are checks and balances in place for detecting welfare fraud, and I’m sure that, like here, the number of people trying to scam the government are very few compared to the number of people just trying to get by. Whether you get money because of disability or because you’re unable to make enough money for other reasons, you deserve that money."

176082252,Especially something like a rap song written lyrics. Someone told me I’m saying “too many things” in my songs. It’s almost like less is more. More is less. It’s too jam packed he said. Which can be cool sometimes. He says I need a faster beat. But instead I think I need to simplify the lyrics. How would one go about doing that. Any suggestions _AT_MENTION_ ?

176082254,"Being on disability makes me feel horrible. Logically, I know it shouldn’t. I know I need help, at least for the moment, and I shouldn’t let my pride obscure that fact. I don’t judge other people for being on disability. Still, it hurts to have gone from working no matter how I felt and taking pride in doing even menial jobs to getting stressed out by those same jobs to the point of not being able to do them anymore without practically inviting another breakdown. I wish I knew what to say to make you all feel better. I guess we just have to keep reminding ourselves that we didn’t ask for this lot in life, and we deserve to be helped because we have inherent value as human beings, or that’s how I’m trying to see it."

I feel like nothing is real and all of the things I see are just a product of this simulation… I really don’t know how to explain this, it’s kind of distressing and the more I think about it the less I can shake it off as a delusion.

174362930,I went on depot because I was bad at remembering to take oral meds. I’m not sure whether I took a cognitive hit as a result of not taking the meds as much as I should have done. If I had depressive symptoms they were in the mild range .

176082274,I relapsed three times in a year’s time. The first time was due to a change in meds leading to errors by both me and the doctors as I went off of Latuda and ended up taking less than the recommended dose of the Seroquel they replaced it with. The voices came back leading to a relapse and a Psych Ward visit where they put me back on the Latuda. The Latuda ultimately failed leading to another Psych Ward visit about a week later and a relapse. Then I was put back on Invega and became discontent with the medical system and took some supplements I bought online. When they failed I ended up in the Ward again a few months later. Drying out from the supplements and a delay in the AP’s to the ward led to another more serious relapse. I never completely recovered.

176082277,"I have severe OCD, as do many members of my family, so I do know some what on how to manage intrusive thoughts. The first thing to know is that you can’t get rid of these thoughts. Now, they may lessen in severity and how often it is, but like I said, they can’t go away forever unfortunately. What’s helped me ever since I was twelve is to find something that occupies the mind, whether that be a hobby or something else. What also helped me is to take an SSRI, which is a antidepressant but helps tremendously with intrusive thoughts. In fact, I would say it helped me the most. Another thing you can do is therapy. Therapy has helped me a lot also, especially fighting against the rituals I do after my intrusive thoughts. I plan to go back to therapy for myself because my OCD as gotten a lot worse here recently. But I do want you to know that you’re definitely not alone; there are many, many other people suffering form this too."

The car behind me is following me. These thoughts seem to come out of nowhere and they’re almost overwhelming. I have to convince myself every time that they’re nonsense. Does anyone else get similar thoughts/urges out of the blue like this? Is this a schizophrenia thing?"

I like to believe the best in people and their intentions, and to hope for a good outcome even if the odds are against it."
176082284,"I really struggle with this too. I don’t really have it anymore as much but i think its a matter of a med reducing the grandiose type thoughts. Not to say getting a masters is off the table, but by the sounds of it, im assuming its safe to say there are smaller, more realistic goals to work on for here and now. Unfortunately i dont really know how i got over it. Mostly meds, partly lowering my idea of what being “successful” is."

I have always heard voices/had visuals, even while on the medication, I have learned to manage it on my own. So I had a heart to heart with my psych about wanting to discontinue and we’ve been doing it over the last few months. I’ve gone from 30mg to 7mg thus far, and I’m just elated it is going so well.

I don’t know what to think I spent the day in the outdoors all day and was afraid people were listening in before I even knew about my official schizophrenia diagnosis. I thought it was just me being more mature because of watching out what I’m saying, now I know its paranoia, my boyfriend says I’m nasty and no fun. I want to get back to where I was 5yrs ago before I had more severe symptoms. I feel like the Invega shot induced it all, and its not even the schizophrenia talking, its the meds in a bad way. I want to skip my shot and see what happens. I cant imagine it would be bad if I’m taking an oral antipsychotic. I rely on energy drinks to make life fun, or im just so withdrawan even at 2pm in the day! I need some guidance, since I know 5 years ago was better, what should I do? I don’t want all the 
problems that came about since the shot. That shot is poison to the brain and I agree with _AT_MENTION_ its a chemical labotomy. Also how long should I wait to get a CBC differential, hepatic panel, and Depakote level after I drink alcohol, or even take an antibiotic for a tooth infection thanks. I find no need in satisfying these doctors if they don’t care my mind has got so bad that I cant volunteer. I gave a volunteer application to my GP, and yet to get a call.

Make sure to take soy version, I am adding brands too which I tested myself to make sure it work for you too. Doctors Best Phosphatidylserine 100 mg Soy Serin Aid brand soft gel capsule. Swanson Phosphatidylserine 100 mg soy Sharp PS brand soft gel capsule. This is the ultimate supplement to awaken you from negative symptoms just like L dopa for parkinson disease. Take it early morning as its very stimulating for the brain. Omega 3 Now Foods normal omega 3 soft gel without coating. Its also stimulating and increases effects of phosphatidylserine and best time to take it is with breakfast, preferably with milk. Above two must to try supplements. Below ones are optional if you want bit more. Lione’s mane mushroom, 
gives similar results like phosphatidylserine soy version and omega 3 but not sure if its useful for everyone as it have some effect on immunity and also there is high chance to get impurities in capsule as its mostly sourced from China and also its basically a fungus so allergic reactions might trigger in some so not recommended. Just mentioned. DMG 125 mg, useful for mood, increasing energy, reduces OCD like behaviours, anxiety etc. Great for reducing day time drowsiness. Take it early morning without food."

174362956,"I’ve never not been delusional. First time I got home from college, I had thoughts that I wasn’t real, life wasn’t real, external reality wasn’t real, I lived in the matrix, and that I might have went through a wormhole. But other than that I had severe negative symptoms. I had those 2 delusions and negative symptoms which was “enough” to diagnose me with undifferentiated schizophrenia. Since then, I’ve been sort of low functioning or treatment resistant and had dozens of more delusions which I expanded upon and worsening of symptoms and cognition. My diagnosis changed a lot and I found out I might have Asperger’s Syndrome after my diagnosis at 22 years old. So basically, I’ve been psychotic or delusional non-stop since college at 22 years old which is 9 years ago. I’m 31 now."

174362954,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Psychotropic effects of L-theanine and its clinical properties: from the management of anxiety and stress to a potential use in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Pharmacological research , Aug 2019 11 Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in modern societies, and are ranked the sixth most important contributor of non-fatal negative health outcomes. L-theanine is an amino acid naturally found in green tea (Camellia sinensis) and some other plant extracts, and recent clinical studies have proposed promising adjuvant effects of L-theanine for the negative impact of anxiety and psychological stress on health. In this integrative narrative review, we aimed to appraise and further discuss the effects of L-theanine administration on anxiety disorders and psychological stress. Published data suggests that L-theanine administered at daily doses ranging from 200 to 400?mg for up to 8 weeks are safe and induce anxiolytic and anti-stress effects in acute and chronic co
nditions. L-theanine at doses lower and higher than these may also show promising therapeutic potential; however, a more thorough investigation through randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical trials are necessary to elucidate its effects for longer periods, providing further insights for _NAME_-analyses and the development of recommendation guidelines. Additionally, animal studies investigating a higher dosage, its combination with other pharmacological compounds and associated metabolic comorbidities are recommended, as cases of hepatotoxicity associated with the consumption of green tea extract have been reported."

But I feel like you guys are the reason I get better a lot. But not as much as me being the reason you guys get better. I share unusual beliefs and label it delusion because it helps me understand it to explain it. Other posters just say they suffer from delusions. I can never keep them secret maybe.

But this stopped after I started taking medication (Risperidone). It’s difficult for me to post about these things because I know it’s hard to believe. And I can’t tell you how much I wish I were making these up. I have a lot of tactile hallucinations. The voices I have only say three things. Yes, No and hmmm. It’s so weird. Because of this my psych doc doesn’t believe I have schizophrenia. I also see a lot of recurring numbers: 11:11, or 11:01, or 1010, or 38, or 83. Lots of people have this particular thing.

She talks about how she was with him every day, multiple times a day and how he wanted her and that she shouldered those six weeks all on her own. But the truth is that I bore the brunt of her grief, acting as her emotional punching bag because that’s what she needed me to be. I suppose that’s who she still needs me to be, and I’m just meant to sit there and take it, because if I try to leave, it only gets worse. Plus my brother sometimes joins in on the goddamn fun.

I’m not sure if he is married. my mom thought not. do you think it would hurt to ask if he wanted to be friends? he is 20 years older than I but i’m in my 40’s. I am 99.9% sure he probably doesn’t want too. i’m just lonely. i love my mom but we have awful fights here and there. it’s embarrassing too because our neighbors are prowling around often at night as they often do and i’m sure have heard. i’m scared to move but finally am in the process of applying for my own apartment. I havent’ lived on my own since i was 25. If it doesn’t work out i’m tempted to go homeless and live and work in my car. lately i really feel the urge to take a road trip and go somewhere.

My question is about the use of bio-resonance to cease smoking. Especially in the first times when I was schizophrenia, I had smoked quite a lot.

174363019,"I don’t mean to denigrate your effort in undoing the paranoia delusion, but I find that negotiating with the delusions is an uphill battle that never ends. The brain is clever, and when it is in a distressed state, it will generate all manner of phantoms to justify the stress. The key, therefore, is to reduce the chronic stress, which I strongly believe is due to some manner of progressive brain damage that resulted from a bad diet, trauma, or drug abuse. I used to think that every other person on the street wanted to kill me, when I was in a prodromal schizophrenic state, but what worked at the time was antipsychotics. After treatment, I still had negative voices that persisted, who continually threatened my life, and some of the people outside seemingly made threats of that nature, but I had stopped caring so much, since I had made peace with the Creator, and believed I had safe passage to the “next place”. So, I had in a sense, rationalized the delusions to a point of semi-functionality, b
ut they were still there. I’m currently trying the alkaline lifestyle approach to healing my brain, and it seems to be working. On days that I adhere to the loosely healthy diet, my symptoms get reduced and my brain feels progressively better (less inflamed.) On days, like yesterday, where I slip and do something stupid like eat 6 pizza pops, my brain gets somewhat inflamed and my symptoms get somewhat worse. This seems to be providing a cumulative benefit, not just a certain level of symptom reduction and a plateau I just have to “deal with”. I strongly feel it will result in a 100% cessation of voices in a few weeks."

I think it has helped to go off of it as I am not as obsessed with sex as I used to be (although I still have occasional problems with that one). I still have trouble talking to women even though the body sizes that I find attractive have expanded some. The main improvement is my dreams are much less disturbing than they used to be and actually contain more imagination. Unfortunately I’ve replaced my obsession with porn with an obsession to follow foreign conflicts like Ukraine and Syria. Just like my fears were about quitting porn I fear I’ll have nothing to do if I quit those habits. I also unfortunately have gained a lot of weight since I’ve quit.

Researchers at the University of Bristol experimented to find out how much l-theanine you’d find in a cup of normally brewed commercial tea. They found that longer brewing times led to higher quantities of the amino acid, but on average: A typical 200 ml cup of brewed black tea contained 24.2 mg of l-theanine (+ or – 5.7 mg) A typical cup of brewed green tea contained 7.9 mg (+ or – 3.8 mg) L-theanine supplements are typically sold as 200 mg doses, so if you drink 8 cups of black tea per day – or many more cups of green tea – you’ll get the same quantity of the amino acid as you’d get by taking a supplement.

I wasn’t happy at all before that because I took everything personally and felt emotions so intensely. Now we fight maybe twice a month, and they are small arguments. I take things less personally. We are both happy and I am truly stable. Please keep going to find a medication that helps, a therapist to talk to, a diet that works, whatever you can that helps. Don’t give up on yourself. I was so depressed before I found Vraylar. I couldn’t handle anything. Now I handle my emotions well. Do it for your own happiness as well as the joy your husband takes in seeing you happy. Trust me I have been in terrible arguments that I caused, we have been to low points. Now we are a team, because I knew I couldn’t live that way a

Unfortunately, I don’t remember living that life anymore. I can’t remember crap. I got a really bad stomach virus when I was a kid. Had the flu and stuff during a field trip in 4-6 grade. I noticed I was not the same after that. My mom’s house had black mold in it when she married my step-father around the time I was a older kid. I had a bad trip in college. I drank energy drinks every day since high school My dad was emotionally abusive and my step-father emotionally cold/distant I might have Aspergers I was socially isolated growing up I had depression, anxiety, and fear/paranoia growin up.

174363037,I can’t seem to make friends or keep friends. I like to believe I have friends in spirit. I don’t have friends except a friend who emails me a few times a year and lives far away.we don’t meet or chat or talk on phone etc so it’s just not enough. Lots of people seem to hate me including many in my own family and my sister seems to hate me too and treats me badly and with disrespect. I like to believe I have friends in spirit who love me and who I can even laugh with in spirit and I love and adore them.im not everyone’s cup of tea. My x boyfriend and I did not have the same sense of humour nor did we have the same political and moral beliefs etc we had very different opinions but were still good partners who loved each other and took care of each other. Delusions and symptoms have also kept me from socialising but there’s also difficulties with people wanting to boss me about and me be the push over and they can treat me badly and with disrespect and expect me to salute them or something 
well I’m not in the army and that stuff doesn’t suit me and I don’t want a part of it specially not like that. The way my sister patted her hand to make me come and sit next to her was so suppressing and rude and disrespectful.she has lots of hate and disrespect for me and does not hold me high nor in love. It is rare for me to feel comfortable around someone. It is rare for me to feel connected to someone. It is so nice when I spiritually just feel good with someone. The woman I’m living with her parents don’t like me and others don’t either. I was a bad friend when I was sick and when I was a binge drinker and lost my friends . I miss having friends. Lonely sometimes. Yes symptoms have played a big part in me not being able to make and keep friends. I want to find my people and be with my people. It will make it easier dealing with the others. Specially the haters .

176082706,"You need to change something. It’s not good for your physical health to spend so much time in bed. Also, you’re wasting you’re youth. And that’s a bad thing to waste. IDK. If you want to get out of bed more and do more, than find something easy to do. I don’t what it is but find some activity that you feel you have a good chance of accomplishing. And do it regularly or at least semi-regularly. Once you accomplish that and feel a little confidence it may lead you to do other things. Personally, I got ill at age 19 in 1980. I was put in my first psyche ward and then spent the rest of the eighties in hospitals and mental health housing. I was relatively stable until about age 28 in 1989 until I had a bad relapse. It took about a year to recover and get back to where I was before the relapse. But during the relapse there was a period where I had nothing to do. I wasn’t working and I was living with my dad and a friend of his and they both went off to work and I spent most of the day alone i
n the apartment until my dad got home and we would go for walks and go play Ms. _PERSON_ Man at the arcade. It was one of the worst periods of my life. I was hospitalized briefly 4 or 5 times. But you know what? I “tried” stuff. I scraped up 4 quarters and walked over to the arcade myself and played four games of Ms. _PERSON_ Man or “Joust”. I went for walks. It was torture but I did it anyways. I read a little. This was before PC’s. I had to entertain myself. I know you’ve heard all this before or similar stuff from other members. But sometimes you have to force yourself to do things you don’t want to do. I got a few jobs, I joined a day treatment program. That was torture too. But I did it anyways. I joined a vocational program. I think a couple people liked me there. But I didn’t socialize a lot. But it led to a job. And then I moved into a group home and got clean and sober and then enrolled in college. I made a friend. Anyways, you may never do any of that stuff but my main point is that 
doing all that stuff was not always fun and games. I did it anyways. I’m naturally shy and I still did stuff. _NAME_ was once quoted as saying, “90% of success is just showing up.” And that’s what I did. Once I got a foothold in the day program, that was my “thing”; that’s just what I did. Once I got inside the vocational program I took it seriously and that was my “thing” too. IDK. Geeez, you don’t want to be forty or fifty and still lay in bed every day."

176082726,last night I was in bed staring at the ceiling and I thought about my delusion of being the chosen one on the same level as a ptsd event. In sense that “it’s something that happened to me. And it’s something I’m going to have to live with from now on. But with the right coping skills and stuff and whatnot I can manage it alright” Does anyone feel like your delusions come from one spot of your brain while your other thoughts from another??? Last night I tried to block the part of the brain it felt the delusions were coming from and there was a great resistance but it felt good to fight it. I have accepted that delusions are like a part of me now. As in an “event” that happened to me. Even though thoughts are just thoughts. It really takes great priority in my life believing these things even if 97% of the time I don’t believe it. 3% is a big chunk of life still.
