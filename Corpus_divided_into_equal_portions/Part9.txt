175969299,Thanks for you so much for sharing! Have the modern drugs limited you in some ways?
175969300,Why do I have a credit card. Idk. I don't trust it with Tweaky but we're not dissociative so he'll know the password =P
175969301,"I'm kind of depressed today too. The sun is peeking out at least. I've been freezing here because the girl next to the door always wants the AC on, and they keep turning it on for her. They're nasty when I complain. It's finally going to warm up this week. It was in the 40s since last week here. I'm so lonely for my friend. He hardly ever wants to really see me. _AT_MENTION_ you should surprise your fiance with taking better self care. Shower, do your hair, wear something cute and use some perfume. It probably won't result in much but it will lift your spirits. I should do the same."
175969302,"Hi, I've finally been diagnosed with PTSD after a long time searching for my condition. I'm now trying to find some people who I can talk to and help be me understand and cope with the 'episodes' better. I'm in Scotland but any groups I can join will be appreciated. Thanks _NAME_."
175969303,5 is pretty solid actually......hope you have a good day....
175969304,My exam is today in a few hours. Nervous. Trying not to let psychotic thinking in or distract me. Need to cram these last couple hours.
175969305,"Until Monday, practice breathing exercises. In through the nose and out through the mouth. Called smelling the roses and blowing out the candles. It will slow your heartrate and breathing. Let us know how your appointment goes. Do you see a therapist? That helps a lot with anxiety and depression. Best wishes, _PERSON_, _NAME_..."

175969309,I highly recommend a free podcast called Guided Meditation Podcast. I listen to it on my phone through the free Castbox app.

175969311,"I'm sorry about your mom and sister , that's a lot of stress. I'm glad your dad is okay. I think doing more self care is a great idea"
175969312,Yes I know. The pmta thing is in May. Hoping for a miracle.
175969313,"Yeah, haven't talked to my brothers in a couple years, they live here too, and I have them on Facebook. Apparently one is too busy to at least say 'hi' or respond to ""how are you doing"" in three years"
175969314,You need to pack a real lunch like a sandwich
174360669,"Okok so.. Your bf should be working on himself. Just being honest. Video games are sucking up all of his time. For you, and for himself. I'm not going to go to college or university anymore. Everything I need to learn is on the internet. If I go to college, when I'm done, all the information will be outdated anyways because everything advances so fast. It's really hard for me with negative symptoms to find ways to make money online or find out what I want to do but if I have no idea what I want to do, there's no point in me spending money on random courses to do it. I struggled with that one course because I wasn't used to learning that way. I do have to work on myself and get help with my mental illness to learn more my way. But over time, I will be so much better. It takes a lot of work to get out of the rut that I was in and I was in the biggest rut possible, absorbing zero information and self medicating with everything so if I can do it, anyone can. What people are supposed to do is have their 
full time job and improve their lives in their free time. With psychedelics, I learned that alcohol is a boring pointless drug so I don't drink it anymore. I'm not even physically capable of being drunk anymore. People go out, get drunk and party and do shallow things and say ""I don't look good in this picture"", talk about sex and judge each other then regret it in the morning, don't remember but say ""I had fun"". I'm long past that. Most people when they are addicted to weed, they stop smoking and realize that it is so much better without it. Weed is supposed to be used as an intellectual aid to do writing and expanding your mind anyways or for treating illness. I have a friend that just smokes it and does nothing but watch movies and listen to music then complain why everyone is talking down to him. He doesn't clean his room and lives in a mess but I never judged him. I just give him hints on how to improve his life slowly because no one can improve themselves over night. I think people that judge other 
so easily are really stupid because they have no consideration for other peoples feelings. You have to have emotional and analytical intelligence to get through to people, otherwise there's no point. Although I do get frustrated like everyone else and no one is perfect. Unless your bf wants to upgrade his job status in college and it's easy and costs not much money and takes little time, then ignore what I'm saying. We only have so much time to do things. That's why I'm so stressed when I'm not even doing much because I'm so hard on myself. When I'm doing things, I feel less stressed. Usually when people have nothing to do, they're less stressed but depressed. I skimmed past your post because you were talking about a car breaking down and I hate cars (Cuz that's what they do. Break down. They're pieces of **** that take people places. That's all they're good for. They pollute the environment). Also, I have no thoughts in the morning which is why I said ""Vyvanse, etc.."" cuz that's all I could say. I'm an hon
est person when I talk about my problems and that I have problems with my thoughts.. Because after all these years, no psychiatrist or therapist ever mentioned that I have bipolar. It's just thoughts. And I get depressed because of that. Real problem with my thoughts.. Your bf is being disrespectful and you have to communicate with him in the best way possible because we don't know the exact situation, just by reading what you say. There might be another side to the story and what he feels. But he's not talking to you so how will we or even you know? It's madness! I'm sorry you're struggling Newtus. I can really see what you're going through. You should have a baby.. no jk.. Not yet.. But I realize that women have it easier than men cuz a man can have a baby at basically any time he wants and women have to have one before their 40's. With your mental illness and lack of money, it's hell. Your bf works and wants to relax but he has to have some more self awareness. The weed doesn't help with that. It just ampl
ifies everything internal and blocks out the external world."
175969315,I'm sorry BB <3 You should take a PRN benzo and drink tea like chamomile tea and just relax for tonight...
175969316,I used to be exactly that. Somehow after psychosis I completely changed.

175969325,Christmas is in 2 weeks.
175969326,"Hi _NAME_ No, they don’t really let me speak about it but not for lack of trying. They just won’t. I don’t leave the house much but no they don’t mock me exactly like that. They might word things to rub in my face...like if I’m hurting.. sometimes talk like I’m not there. This house has the weirdest wires in the basement. They said it was for security but I don’t believe it. Makes me think it might be something more, I just don’t know for sure. What’s the blue light? I can see orbs sometimes and the blue is the color of the bottom of the flame. I raised the issue on Facebook and now I’m kicked off for having a private account posting to myself be turned in for some bs by who if my account was on private..bothers me. I occasionally hear ringing, not a lot. My ear drum busted when I was younger. My family are a bunch of narcissists and I’m the black sheep. I don’t feel like I’m accepted by any other family member. They don’t understand mental illness and have no interest i
n helping. Thank You for the information and Have A Great Night?"
175969327,Right on! There's so much of poetry i still need to understand. A lot of the time I read it and feel and thing nothing. Part of it is the anhedonia but the other part is that I just don't have the nature for it sadly.

175969330,Having a panic attack
175969331,"So it seems like one benzo a night for sleep seems to be ok. Maybe cuz of the fact that the brain repairs itself during sleep and is a sedated state during that time anyways. 1mg of Ativan or 7.5mg of zopiclone. My mom takes 1mg of Ativan every night to sleep and has been doing it for ~3 years so I was looking up reviews because I was worried. But people have been taking 1mg a night for 15-20 years with no problem. The reason that I'm worried is because of the ""Panic attack effect""!!!, stop taking and then BOOMBOOMBOOM the heart beats and you hear it in your ears.. My mom can't ever have that.. But if she sticks to 1mg a night and never takes extra, that won't happen. It works for psychophysiological insomnia if that's what it is. Some people just can't do proper sleep hygiene.. It's impossible because there's so much on their minds. So I assume that I can take one zopiclone every night to sleep for 1-2 years until I fix my mental health - I estimate that that's how long it's going to take - Cons
idering how well my mental health has been getting the past 3-4 years. It's like a moderate benzo cuz it doesn't work for anxiety - Just as a hypnotic. And my dads friend took one zopiclone for 15 years and it put him to sleep every time. He remembers everything and tells stories like they happened yesterday so there's no problem with his memory or cognition. Some people say that zopiclone makes them feel stupid in the morning but a coffee helps me. There's so many scare stories about benzos and although they are true - Only in high doses every day. Newtus took 0.5mg of Xanax 4x a day and then had to stop cold turkey (Like many doctors do to people) - So there's one bit of second hand information."
175969332,"I've kinda gone through a similar pattern, although over less time. A med either doesn't work for me, or only works for a little while and then stops working. I'm hoping this Zyprexa/Haldol combo is different and it'll keep working, but you never know."

Now that it's grown out it's a pain in the *** to maintain even though I don't do much to maintain it like wash it everyday and brush it. But it'll be nice to when I've neglected my hygiene not to have to forcefully brush out my rat nest of a hair. I look better with longer hair so I keep it i guess.

175969349,"I am a 53 year old man and I have an addiction to alcohol among other things. I have never used drugs and never plan on it. I have lost the woman I love because of alcohol and currently I have a desire to want to wear women's clothes. I feel sexy when I am wearing a female's clothing. Today, the woman that I love, dropped by unplanned and caught me wearing a bra and a dress. When she saw me, she said that is it, I am done and that hurt me to the core. She had separated from me several month's ago for me to try and get my act together. I am a responsible person and have a steady job, but I have these urges that are not normal. I want to be the man she wants me to be and I want to be with her, but I keep doing things that keep destroying what we are trying to rebuild. Sometimes I feel there is no hope for me. I feel I have lost her forever, and I know without some major changes I have. I have tried AA with my drinking and I failed, this new urge I have is even beyond her. So I am asking if anyone has 
had something similar and can provide some assistance to my disorder."
175969350,Hi Bam. I know your post is from a year ago but I have been away for some time we used to have so much fun in chat wat back in 2006/2007. I had a heart attach few years back. I had a real bad upper left arm ache that lasted for the day and evening. I went to bed arm still aching so got up to take some Tylenol. As I was standing looking out the window I got a pain in the centre of my chest. The pain in my arm suddenly went away. The pain was certainly there but not oh my God that hurts. Then I got pressure in my chest. Like a heavy weight resting on my chest. I knew what was going on. Took 4 aspirin and called 911. The rest as they say is history!! Cheers. Hope to hear from you!
175969351,"I have drug induced insomnia from zyprexa. All the herbal remedies I have tried are useless.

Even drugs like trazadone and gabapentin were useless for me."
175969352,"So, as many folks know, I have bp 1, but, I spend much, maybe most, of my time these days dealing with psychotic symptoms. I was just wondering how frequently people here think they have to deal with these issues? Once a month? A week? Every day? I had it almost very day for about 8 months, then, had a nice 3-4 weeks with really none and now, it is kind of back again a bit every dayish, I would say. Sometimes, just a bit of paranoia. Sometimes, voices or other auditory stuff. Sometimes visual or derealization or other things. Anyhow, just wondering where I fit in the scheme of things. Thanks, guys!!"

175969356,"I think it’s hard enough not to develop an eating disorder with APs but if you’ve had one in the past it’s even harder. Even the more weight neutral APs you have to eat with....it’s been said that the eating is tied to the effectiveness of APs though it’s hard to prove. There’s just something wrong with that, that they can’t find truly weight neutral APs. As far as restriction realize it’s fuel that your body needs to be healthy. You don’t want to be running on fumes. I think the minimum number of calories docs want you to get is 1200 a day."

175969359,So I used to be 160 lbs and lost weight. I was starting to actually like the way I look then I starting taking risperdal and started gaining the weight back now I'm scared to gain the weight back. Any tips on how to avoid wanting to binge eat.

175969365,"You've got two things going on: pain and anxiety. That's a very tough combination! I don't have significant pain, so I can't be of any help there, except to empathize. about anxiety, I had moderately debilitating anxiety. I've tried Pamelor (one of the tricyclics like you are taking) and it didn't work; in fact, I couldn't sleep well when on that drug. I've also taken Zoloft, which was okay, but I didn't stay on it too long. Ten years ago, when my elderly parents needed care and moved to be near us--and job stress--I knew I needed to take something to dampen the anxiety. Citalopram, which is FDA approved for anxiety, worked well after the initial adjustment period, and has ever since, although I upped the dose from 20 mg to 40 mg about 5 years ago. I have not seen a psychiatrist, though my internal medicine doctor and sleep doctor both suggested one of the newer anti-anxiety meds (citalopram). I have seen a psychologist to learn CBT (cognitive behavior therapy). The medication to me is a anti-anxie
ty foundation that I have built on with other coping skills. It's been hard work, but worth it. On a non-anxious/calm scale of 1 to 10 most days are 7 or above. The excrement still hits the ventilation system now and then, but that's life. The important thing is that I know what to do to get back on track."

175969406,"Hey Maryland2020. I'm sorry that your son is going through this. Covid has had an impact on everyone's mental health. For people that have suffered from mental illness in the past I think it is that much harder. Routines have been interrupted, the help that we receive has to be modified and the list goes on. When I was 19 and in college I didn't have any friends. I just had people I went to class with. If you added the virus in I would have really struggled. My best piece of advice is to make sure that he knows that you are there for him and that you won't judge him. As a parent myself, I'm sure that you already do that. Sometimes it just helps to look back on how we felt telling our mothers things :). I would tell him about your concerns if you haven't already. Sometimes to hear the concerns of someone you care about can give a person the push that they need to get help. If he doesn't want to go to a dr to prescribe him medication then a therapist is always an option. Depending on the restrictions 
right now is could be virtual or in person. For me, a therapist gave me someone else to be accountable to. It gives me a routine that I really need (may not be something your son needs). I always put in my posts that I am an open book. If you have anything that I can help you with shoot me a message or reply on here. I always follow the thread I comment on and I am on here most nights."

Maybe if it was 40 or around there. Maybe when it goes on sale!!! I been on a multiplayer game kick right now for quite a bit of time (months). So I’ve been playing MMO’s for awwwhilllle. Most switch games are single player and what makes me so mad and sad is that there’s no real way to play with or contact your friends on switch unless you literally text them/call them and say “hey wanna play this game with me?” And even then, only some games are multiplayer on switch and it sucks. At least for right now."

175969416,"Hello everyone, pleasure to meet all of you. I am here because I am suffering from anxiety and panic attacks and I have for several years. sometimes it’s worse than others, right now of course it’s pretty bad with all of the negative things going on in the world. I wanted to try to find a way to connect with others who share the same challenge and to try to see if that would help control the attacks. When I have these attacks I feel crippled by them to the point where I can’t do simple tasks like: have a conversation, drive a car, prepare a meal, simple things that should not be a challenge I’m frozen and I am feeling like I’m out of body and I don’t understand what I’m doing here. I almost feel paralyzed like I’ve lost my motor skills I tremble sometimes, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizzy, almost feel like I could pass out. Very overwhelming. My mind is racing and can’t land on a single thought it’s like everything become super busy and I am overcome by all the feelin
gs and emotions all at one time. I am someone who Hass to be in control so this feeling is extremely uneasy and it’s terrifying. Has anyone else experienced similar feelings and if so what do you do, or have you done to help yourself either prevent this from happening or to get yourself in a good space as quick as possible."
175969417,"It is ridiculous doctors won't prescribe even low doses anymore to those of us who never abused it. It has more to do with the government/DEA than with doctors. All those natural supplements and buspar mentioned by the last poster would never do a thing for me. I think an occasional xanax for sleep is perfectly fine. You can try going to a different doctor. Some will give it out and others won't. I had 2 doctors telk me they will give klonopin but not xanax, which makes zero sense to me."

175969419,"YouTube Gameloft (which develops mobile games) made a copyright strike against Sony's new ""Miles Morales"" Spider-Man PS5 game. Yes, the game that is being launched with the new PS5 console. Apparently Gameloft thinks that Sony infringed their rights. Now you cannot see the game trailer anymore unless you look for people who downloaded the video and reuploaded it on their own. So weird that a mobile game company is doing this. They made ONE Spider-Man game 6 years ago and I believe they lost the rights to make Spider-Man games. Maybe they are just being sour? Oh well. I just thought it was interesting."

He had stopped his medication because it impaired his thinking, productivity, motivation, and libido; however, the dangers posed by not taking medications regularly are not worth the risk to others' lives. Suicide can also cross your mind when you are off your meds, so always stay compliant with your regimen, and work with your doctor to find the optimal dosage."

But when his dad passed after a few days of crying, he was just very quiet and extremely reserved. I asked him if he wanted to hurt himself last night but he said no. Still worried because he owns a firearm. But idk. I worry so hard not just cause he’s my fiancé but because he’s a white male and I’m not trying to be discriminative but white males have a high rate of sui with you know what. Much higher than African American males and females and females of the same race. But I’ve never seen him like this before. Maybe except when his dad died. He’s in the shower now. Which is good. I need to do instacart today or something idk. Or something easier like doordash where I don’t have to go into a store for long periods. I don’t have my car just yet tho.

175969434,"I suppose, but I don't equate the dreary misama of socializing with the dreary miasma of avolition, although, at base, they probably both come from the same lack of motivation. One is externally directed, the other internally. I know why I avoid people. I don't know why I find it so difficult to perform purposeful activities. This creates the illusion that, in each case, reluctance comes from different motivations; with a very few exceptions, I gain very little from socializing whereas my own little projects (aside from routine housework or hygiene) offer great opportunities for enrichment and, as I said elsewhere, fulfillment."

I've had two regular eye exams one just two weeks ago and saw an ophthalmologist about a year ago and all said my eyes were fine just a little astigmatism.. also if I move my fingers I can see a clear air or soemthing a clear glow around my hands sometimes ..I get very anxious and read about my symptoms all of the time so I do believe I make it worse on myself.. just wondering others experience

175969446,I slept 8 hours 22 minutes which is really good because normally I have a hard time getting myself up and sleep like 11 hours. I'm working on waking up a little earlier each day until I'm able to wake up at 6am.
175969447,I always thought the heaviness feeling was cuz I was overweight but this feeling and feelings I get off meds (which is very rare nowadays) proves me wrong. I think the APs make me feel heavy and lethargic. This is all weird to me because I’m used to anxiety and lethargy and no energy. And now I just feel normal.
175969448,Didnt wake up til about now really. Noon. Canceled all my podcasts I'm supposed to do today until I get my medicine sorted out. Anddddd... I got a text message from my cousin in California. My grandma is in the emergency room. I hope she doesnt die. Shes like 90 I think. My grandpa just died this past September. They are my last grandparents.

175969454,"My thoughts on it are: It grasps at the truths of the meaning of human suffering and its relationship to meaning. It details a psychiatrist's journey through concentration camps and Nazi Germany to finding what makes life worth living. It's not a linear path, and I don't think the book was intended to be one. Rather, it shows by way of example and also through other means, why life matters. He discusses the concept of logotherapy -- which is essentially ""meaning""-therapy. I thought it was a worthwhile read for those reasons. It's also fairly short as far as impactful books go. Hopefully that will help you determine whether you want to read it or not."

175969467,Still completely at a loss here . I’ve been dealing with this air hunger/suffocation feeling for almost a year straight now . I just can’t get an answer or the right track to treatment. All any physician can tell me is that it’s GAD . Is this possible? Can anyone relate to this AT ALL? Nothing helps . I’ve experimented with anxiety meds with the guidance of doctors but nothing relives this urge to take deep breaths . I literally feel as if I’m being smothered 24/7 but before all this started not once did I become aware of my breathing . Have had every test done to rule an organic cause to this symptom . I see many other people suffering with this nonsense and there is little to no explanation to this. It just ruins an individuals life in the most silent way . Can a mental disorder like anxiety depression or stress really cause such a parked symptom? PLEASE any insight is much appreciated .
175969468,"Had to text a couple of my friends because I'm not feeling well emotionally. It's step one on my safety plan so I had to do it. One responded and kind of helped but not really. The other one is usually more helpful but she's also a nurse so she works odd hours and I don't know when she gets a break. Sometimes she just waits and texts me when she gets home. She's usually really helpful though so that's good. I just gotta wait to hear from her. Been posting on the self harm forum too and it's helping a little, just talking through the urges."
175969469,I'm having a strange night. Earlier I was thinking I was getting messages in music from God it wasn't anything bad though it was like he was telling me everything would be okay and he's back in my life now . I feel gods presence again for the first time in like a year I just feel strange. I almost started crying because I was starting to think someone got in my apartment and poisoned my meds
175969470,"Anxiety was worse this week. The only relief I get is when I’m very busy at work. But when I have down time, the anxiety creeps in. I registered for an MBSR class. Anyone try that?"
175969471,That's terrible news. I'm sorry for your loss. The doctor told me my cat has 3 to 6 months before she passes away. she's about 17 years old. I got her the day I got out of the hospital 6 years ago on valentines day. I came home with my girlfriend and there she was with a litterbox and everything. She is the best cat.

175969507,"Well, there are two schools of thought here... So, pre-DSM-III, schizoid PD, schizotypal PD and avoidant PD were considered the same disorder. Some people are still mad about it. Anyway, as you probably know, both schizoid PD and avoidant PD sufferers typically want to spend time alone, but the reasons they give for wanting to be alone are very different. Schizoids typically say they do not like spending time with others, while avoidants do want relationships with others but fear ridicule or rejection. Another contrast is that avoidants seem really sensitive to criticism while schizoids seem unaffected by praise or criticism. So, we have some dramatic opposites. Some psychoanalysts like to argue that schizoids are really just avoidants who are denying or repressing their fears of abandonment and judgement, but personally, I do not have any respect for psychoanalytics."

I’m not gonna risk my disability for 88 dollars a week."

Like Im not currently at risk or in crisis, but i genuinely want to know why it is so so so frowned upon. Is it not just selfishness on your loved ones parts? Because if you did it, your problems would, quite literally, be gone but then they would have some. If your goal is to solve your own then what is so wrong? I dont entirely understand the claim that ""what if it gets better"" because what if it doesnt? there is no guarantee either way. Why do others have more of a say on my life than i do?

175969569,"Hi HW friends, I have been trying to resolve this worry without any type of reassurance for a couple of days now but I think it's taking over now. So here I am I started having this dull pain/pressure feeling behind my right ear two days ago, you know that hairline bone area. It seems to be happening a lot in morning when I wake up and on and off whole day until late evening, then it subsides. I really don't have any discomfort during sleep even when I wake up at night I don't feel pain. I sometimes feel a fullness in my ear also and some clicking sounds / ringing. I forced myself to check once if there is something swollen behind ear (I really don't know where lymph nodes are xD but couldn't find anything out of the normal). So I said, yes this is typical somatic symptom of anxiety, when you focus it is there. When you shift your focus, it gets better or disappears for a while. I was coping with it thinking it was like this. But today I also noticed soreness in that node you have under your ear un
der the jaw, you know the one that hurts and gets swollen when you get sick. My whole ear also feels a bit sore But I dont have throat pain, sore throat, etc. Other than that I feel fine, just a little increased blood pressure in 10 units both - don't know what it is called in English :P I feel warm sometimes but I don't think it's fever. So it made me worry, I think I need to ask around what it can be. I have an appointment with my therapist on Monday so I can show her my written thoughts but, I have hard time letting go now. I don't know if I have allergies or anything. never tested. But I do have post nasal drip, that's for sure. Oh and I do use those big headphones when using computer, and even when walking outside. It's always that type on my ears, most of time. can be the reason but still doesn't explain the sore lymph node. sorry for long post <3"

175969628,"Hello, I’m sorry to hear you re struggling. You mention you separated from your husband. I assume you have separate households then as well? Why do u feel guilty seeing another man? Are you not fully over your ex or do u feel it’s too soon to see another man? My husband and I briefly separated beg of the year, we did the “nesting” for 5 months... (and yes it is emotionally draining) until COVID hit... and we decided to move back into the house(where our two daughters live) for financial reasons... now COVID is still an issue. I went into a full blown depression and anxiety etc...and working my way out of it w meds, therapy... meditating etc.... I feel stuck and still _USER_ID_ myself into a pretzel every day to please everyone in the family...not sure what will happen. I am not happy.... at all in my marriage. But a new love or someone to give me some support would be a nice thing I assume...u want to talk more, feel free to write to me. You are certainly not alone. I am very fearful to mak

175969637,"I like Flowerblossoms' idea about one thing a day with your daughter. I might add, one thing a day for you. The thing for you might require you to row against a strong tide pulling you in the direction of I don't want to! Or, I can't! But, maybe if you wrote a list of these things, the next day choose from the list and accomplish it perhaps in baby steps, you might feel some satisfaction. Say, the thing with your daughter is baking cookies. You'll have the cookies! And you'll have fun with your daughter. It will drain you. So the thing for yourself should be small. Maybe create a count my blessings scrapbook page. I read that one should create an hour a day to feel really horrible about everything so after that hour you have to wait until the next day to dwell on the virus, etc. It sounded a little unrealistic to me, but perhaps give it a try? I hope these ideas are not too lame. I actually gave some similar thoughts to a friend on the phone and he kept responding, I'm not going to do that. Finally
, I said, that is the definition of crazy. Doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different outcome. So try to break a pattern, do something different, see how it makes you feel.

We've all got our schizoid origins story and mine starts with my parents.. You might could say I have a lot of experience with mental health systems in the US I've been pouring over your board for a couple months now and really liked some of what I read. We're an introspective people (sort of by definition) and other member's interpretations of their lives has been really illuminating for me. Especially helpful has been the talk of fantasies because for the longest time I wasn't sure I ticked that box. I oscillate between reality and my fantasy quite a lot though, it turns out, and this realization was what made m

I also made a dermatologist appt for her. She has bad excema. We’ve been treating it since she was an infant. Nothing really helps. I think it’s tied up in her allergies.

175969684,"Though I haven't figured out the ""so what"" approach, I've noticed I get a surge of adrenaline sometimes when I'm reacting to things and I spend a surprising amount of time in that mode even if it's in connection to situations rather than what people say. I've made a point to ask questions instead of charging in. As a result, I've not gotten into any squabbles today and haven't made others on the defensive as much either. Also, trying to understand things that are illogical makes them less frustrating than judging them does. Tangenting over to: sleep deprived I'm going to collapse. I've barely slept and I can barely think or see straight and it causes the following to be on my mind along with everything else... There's a pillow. A spot of black catches my focus as it suddenly goes scurrying across it. It's a male falsewidow spider * yes, I can tell the difference - females have the stereotypical blackwidow shape. On on the other hand, male falsewidows do not, and like male blackwidows, their fangs 
can't break skin to envomate humans. Nonetheless, I hurriedly grab the pillow before he eight-leggedly crawls onto the bed. ""Why is he not in a cobweb?"" I muse to myself He speeds up his meandering into a trot hoping to make the jump over the ever increasing gap as I move his standing point further and further from his goal. The movement startles him. He transitions into a full-fledged gallop towards the higher ground with spindley legs flying everywhere, which coincidentally, is where my hand is. I half drop, half throw the pillow onto the floor. For a moment peace fills the room, but then I become worried as to whether he survived the landing. I rush over to it, just as he triumphantly climbs up towards me to reassure me that he survived. I start shaking and gently hitting his pillow against the ground trying to knock him off of it. It doesn't work. I don't want to lose sight of him, but I need to go get a cup to put him outside. First, I grab something to sweep him off what's mine. I've already referred 
to it as his (the arachnid's) pillow once. I hear a curious thud as he hits the floor. Again, I worry about the impact, but soon enough, he gathers his wits - and is off to the races again. I search around desperately for something I can put over him to no avail. I look back and he's gone. I ######6 hate it when I lose spiders."

175969687,"So my dads foot is still hurt. It's been hurt for like years and hes never been to a doctor. Every once and awhile it becomes inflamed. My sister is taking him to urgent care tomorrow. Also, I walked into my old bathroom at his house today. There was mold all over the ceiling and walls of the bathroom. And the shower curtain. I was shocked to high hell. My heart broke in pieces. The ceiling looked like it was about to cave in due to some sort of water damage. It was curved downward. Last time I was there, this wasnt like this. He said he might have a roof leak. But I also know not only does his foundation is bad, his central a/c and heat doesnt work. Amongst so many other things. Hes been using the kitchen sink without, like a top. Like it's just a hose spraying water out of the sink. Etc so much more stuff. Its depressing. Part of the reason I had to get out of there. But idk what to do."

175969690,"Out of interest, if you use antipsychotics for a long time, how hard is it then (once you quit) to lose the weight you gained on them? Is it possible at all? Or is the weight gain somehow diet-resistant and almost impossible to shed, the longer you have taken antipsychotics? Would appreciate responses from someone who knows about the subject. On the other hand, is it possible to get rid of side effects a year or so after stopping use of antipsychotics, or do the side effects always come back once one has started using them and then stopped (this includes hallucinations in its own right, for example)? How often do the side effects come back after one has stopped taking them?"

175969712,"Hello, all! I'm new to this forum. Got Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. I feel comfortable here; I like it. As I'm moving along I'm striving for some self-discovery. That means to utilize things that I seem to hold dear. I would like to be able to discuss my illness with individuals who have been there and back again. I don't go to therapy currently, so this is a step that I hope to take for my well-being. I went through a period of being so down on myself. It seemed like no one was there for me, but I just sort of shirked away everything that people tried to throw at me. I try not to be an emotional person -- or something like that. When it all comes boiling over the way it did, I really wish there was somebody to hold onto. So, here is my chance to have some comforting words my way. I feel lost in the woods, and my illness is some vampire or sprite chasing after me with all its devouring and intimidation. It's attitude to me is like it isn't even me. And I did take psychology classes, but 
what it is is one big beast. I got my Invega shot though. They went up on the dose. I'm feeling like in the next few days, it's going to be alright. I'm feeling the affects off it more and more. I'm so glad they decided to put me on Invega. I really did pray they would. (I did not think I could just ask them for some reason). Low and behold, prayer answered. I'm actually feeling safe and sound. Like I don't need to fight back on anything since it is all attacking me. I really want to quit smoking also. I think that I finally made the decision to quit it forever. I have a pack and a little bit of another pack. Stupidly went to a gas station when I had my mind set on quitting. This habit comprises over half the time I'm awake, and it's time to quit. I'm no distinguished woman because I smoke cigarettes. Have to get it through my head. I'm putting off the de-addiction process because I just think that it will be excruciating. And I did it all these years. I think it's going to be fear of God like. But the doctor
s at the hospital when I got admitted in July 2019 made me a not addict of cigarettes. And it wasn't excruciating. Bless them. Went back to the cigarettes in July 2020. Stupidly. I feel like I need guidance for this (because I really got it in my mind I can't do this alone). I have it in mind that I am blindly grasping at straws. I love the sunlight now. One doctor told me to get some sunlight. And I was like a vampire with my sparkling skin because I hardly ever stepped outside. That is my reason for keeping with cigarettes. I am part Native American and my skin is an interesting color. My Grandma _NAME_ would tell stories of being a half Native American Indian. I look at my skin now and I'm like, ""Yes, you can tell it."" I cannot wait to tan this summer. I think I'm going to go outside and take pictures of the sun from the backyard again. And quit the smoking. Definitely. Maybe my Mom is more wisdom-atic than I believe about this. On a Facebook scan of my profile picture, supposed to tell what peoples from 
what countries you look like said, Polish, Swedish, Irish, and German. And my Grandpa was part Swiss by a family tree look at. Dad's, if I recollect well, his DNA testing, said Caucasian Mountains -- so I thought Turkey. I cannot remember what else. My sister's said ""Scandinavia"". She made a big show of it. And my Mom's family sigil said English with a wolf on it! I've never done a real family genealogy based on DNA obviously. I'm piecing together this stuff."

175969727,Today this place is unbearable. I feel buried by the fact that an aide unpacked my giant bags for me. Everytime I feel more permanent here I get upset. The little old lady who is next to me was sleeping without a covering and she looked so vulnerable it made me want to cry. I don't know how I'm going to survive here. I could go back to watching TV all day alone in my apt again. I wouldn't be happy but I feel very pressured here and I want to be alone.
175969728,Morning! Yay it’s Friday!!! I had a hard time falling asleep last night but once I did I slept like the dead. I have been off of Ambien for a little over 6 months now. Tonight is prom! His gf is so excited. I can’t wait to see them all dolled up.

I don't know how I could start over. I have no family, no friends and I live 200 miles from my hometown. I miss the life I used to have and there's no way I will ever have it back.

175969733,"Hello Everyone, The past few months, I have been feeling acute financial stress. I feel like I am just barely getting by with my salary. Fortunately I will be getting a big pay raise in June. In spite of this I feel depressed and down. I try to save as much as I can and I don't really go out but I feel like there is only so much I can save and put away. I have applied for a few part time jobs. I have followed up in person only to be told that the positions were filled. I'm like ""Why did you guys even post the jobs to begin with"". I will keep pressing on and try to find a part time but the stress is getting to me. Does anyone have any coping tips for financial stress?"

175969738,"Didn’t get anything done today. So tired idk why. Just woke up at 5:30pm. I’ve been sleeping the whole night and going to bed early past few days. Early as in, not at 2-3am, but at like 11pm - 12am. I take my meds at 10pm. Lots of crying yesterday tho. _PERSON_ says it’s really hard for him to be around me when I’m certain ways. Which with what he told me, it has to do with my mental illness. Like me not understanding things or being able to take hints, but I told him that is both a cognitive and social defect I’ve suffered from being so sick. Also, how I don’t talk in groups of people, like when we goto see his friends. I said I don’t like being the third wheel or the 4th wheel and I’m also shy around these people, idk them like u do. Also, how I’m sad all the time. He says it’s draining. I get that. I don’t think I’m sad all the time. The way he explained it was how i just sit at the computer desk and stare into space, or when I basically just sit and sit and sit. Or have 
my head down. Or I look sad. But none of that is sadness. Unfortunately, it’s my mental illness. I sit, a lot, doing nothing but thinking. Not engaging in the computer or my phone or anything. That’s when I’m thinking. I’ve had tons of people feel awkward or question the way I look, asking me if I’m ok, because I’d be in deep thought and they’d think something was wrong. I make weird faces or I’ll stare into space. It’s really just me purely thinking about things. I’m not sad, or psychotic, or anything. Just thinking. Who doesn’t think about what all they need to do for the day? Or add up math in their head to pay bills. Etc stuff like that. Or writing my poetry or whatever. If I have my head down it’s cuz I’m tired and resting for a few, my mind and body. Who doesn’t do that? I think I just look weird when I’m thinking. And it’s enhanced by my facial expressions and eyes. Which also was why I was told, in high school, that I’d make a great actress. I was told I have so much 
expression to my face. Nearly everyone tells me, if not every single person I’ve ever met! Also, genetically, the way my eyes are shaped, my top eyelids are big. So when I’m just looking like normal, it looks like I’m high or sad. Like my eyes are half mast or whatever. Lmao. Can’t tell u how many people in high school thought I was high in class. I don’t do drugs or smoke that stuff. I told him most of this is a misunderstanding on his part."

175969741,"Hi everyone, how are things? I will try to play catch up this weekend. I am struggling. Had a great week with my partner subtract some issues that occurred. But now am dealing with a TON of gender dysphoria. And trauma. It’s challenging me in every way again and I gotta overcome it. One day. No. Not one day, it WILL happen. I woke up paranoid thinking there was a keylogger on my partner’s computer and microphones in the wall. Also was affected by past trauma. I am not sure what to do. I talked to the therapist earlier and she helped me a little over the phone. Almost threw up 5 times this morning from taking meds and anxiety. It’s just not a good day in general."
175969742,Out of a job.
175969743,Had a MIND REST and then SLEPT for HOURS.

175969745,"My friend is in town today. We're going out for brunch at our egg cafe at some point. But he's probably here to clear out stuff I'm throwing overboard. And when the apt is cleared out, he will give it up I guess. After that he'll probably never come. I'm so depressed. And it cost like $60.00 to get my ear pierced, and the stud they put in was too small and it fell out. And the nursing home confiscated my rubbing alcohol and saline spray. I'm really depressed. I'll have to ask for permission to pierce my ear so that I can keep some saline on my dresser. But that's not a good idea, because what if they say no? I still have cramps in my lower back but it's not nearly as bad as it was. Thank God it's getting better. I hope everyone will have a nice day, even if it's too hot out."
175969746,Waking up feeling the same. I didn’t want to get out of bed but I did. Drank coffee. Now I should try to study but idk how much I can focus. Sorry for posting so much. I feel I’m bothering everyone.

175969753,I’ve been feeling out of breath since an hour or two ago. Before this my fever came back and I felt drowsy and nauseous.
175969754,"Yeah it's hard. Also, give yourself some compassion. First off, dating is hard. Second, you are dealing with mental health issues. So give yourself an extra break for both of those things. I find the less I concentrate on dating, the more things go naturally. I know it's kind of a strange thing to try to express, but the less I worry about it, perhaps, the more things flow. That said, I haven't really been able to have a steady relationship ever. Also, I'm not opposed to the idea of being alone later in life, though I know you expressed the desire to be with someone. About revealing the diagnosis--don't treat it as an obligation--treat it as something you will reveal to whomever you're dating at the right moment when you feel comfortable. You don't need to tell everything on the first date (or even the second, or third, or fourth, etc.) All you really need to do when you're just starting to date someone is to see if you have a connection or not. If so, great. If not, then move on. Funny how I can g
ive dating advice but yet I've never had a real relationship."
175969755,Good to hear from you hope things settle down at work soon
175969756,Thanks guys!!!
175969757,I’m glad you were able to get one...a lot of people are off right now.
175969758,"It sounds like you are in your own head a lot. Right now we are all getting on each others nerves because we are in close quarters together. That alone makes things tougher than they are. If I were you, I would just continue trying to be pleasant and talk to him after things have gotten better with this virus. What do you mean when you say ""taking a trip somewhere""? I don't know about where you are but in our state you can only go out for essential reasons. Just saying. I think if you were to open up with your therapist it would help you dealing with things at home. They are there so we can figure out answers. Why do you feel guilty? Unless I have missed something it doesn't sound like you have done anything to feel guilty about. I think it is great you are cooking. I cook every day. I don't do a lot else at the moment but I do cook. You are helping out by cooking. That is a good thing. Maybe you would rather work. If you would rather work, what would you like to do? Just curious. Though work, un
less essential, really isn't in the plan right now. What does your husband do? Is he working now or not? A lot of people had to stop working. What do you mean by the love you receive feeling conditional? In relationships it is good to get what we need but we seldom do. It is two different people coming together and doing the best they can. Relationships just like our lives aren't perfect. But we try the best we can. I think it is great you are helping out at home. But I am sorry you are stuck there with the virus and all. I really feel for the people dealing with it, the first responders, doctors, nurses. Anybody who has to deal with it. I think we are so fortunate not to have to deal with it or not to know somebody close that has died with it yet. We are lucky. You and I. Give yourself a break. Only deal with the things you know for sure. Keep your mind busy. I am sure you have time for a hobby. Something you enjoy. You can do it. I hope you have a good night. I am sorry I got a little off track. But I wish 
you the best. Hugs, _NAME_... 12"

I think from me taking the dogs out yesterday morning on a 2-roped leash, and one went behind me and they basically both started pulling and buckled my knees. I was embarrassed and nervous. Probably also cuz I took both of them together and they are strong af. Thor is 40 pounds and I swear _USER_ID_ has got to be 45 or 50 pounds. Its extremely hard to walk them together. I cant do that anymore. My knee is in a lot of pain."

175969772,"Of course, we all have social anxieties. However, serious shyness/severe social anxiety can be a real problem for those who suffer from it. Those who are rather shy in general are less likely to have lots of good quality relationships with friends. They're also more likely to get married later on in life than those who aren't shy. And they're less likely to get married at all compared to those who aren't shy. So if you're shy, I think it's a good idea to try to overcome it sooner in your life rather than putting it off later on. And if that means seeing a therapist or having to go on medication, then so be it. I just suggest this because if you're shy, I'd hate to see you miss out."

However, I've been reading stories of people having seizures at this dosage although they previously never had seizures. I don't know what to do."

Recently, I experienced globes sensation, the feeling of having a lump in the throat, and I actually went to the ER because I thought my throat was closing. I'm sorry you have to experience this. If I'm not mistaken, I gather that you are religious from your previous posts. Maybe speaking with your pastor or other church members will help alleviate your anxiety. Everything is so uncertain right now. We have so little control over what may or may not happen that it's bound to cause stress and anxiety.

Your wife and child is still there with you, them alone is a good reason to keep moving forward. There is no where else to go but up. We all have our moments and sometimes its worse than others. Don't give up on yourself or your family. Focus on your family. Do something positive, like going back to school. I'm 37 and I just went back to school a few months ago. I been going to school on and off for years but I'm going to make this my last go around. I want more for myself and I'm not going to let my bipolar get the best of me and I wish you do the same.

I remember one nurse saying “you need to put on weight anyway. You’re too skinny”. And doctors lying to me about the weight gain. Openly lying to me. So I thought it was all me, the weight gain. I’ve been gyped by the mental health system. Completely. Lied to and then providers wonder why I never wanna goto the hospital. My therapist talks about hospital like it’s a private getaway.

175969799,I think people know when it’s time to try medication. Sounds like you are there. Maybe start with a small dose and increase as needed. That could help minimize side effects. You can do this. Millions of others have And it’s not an irreversible decision. You should give it a fair shot but you can switch or go off gradually if you need to. Good luck.

175969810,"So I did some research.. My moms breast cancer is caused by high estrogen and progesterone (Which is the most common type of breast cancer and easier to treat) and the hormones feed the cancer but chemo and radiation can damage the heart and my moms heart is already severely damaged (She has long QT syndrome, mitral valve prolapse and an aortic aneurysm) so the treatment could cause congestive heart failure where you can't even do the slightest exercise, fluid builds up in the body including the lungs, feet, etc.. There is no cure and she would live for a few years. Apparently women with high estrogen and progesterone are more likely to have male sons that are gay (My brother is gay) or have autism (More likely to have gender identity, sexual orientation issues like asexuality and high IQ) and have menopause later in life (My mom is 55 and still hasn't had it yet) and have daughters that are more likely to have high estrogen and progesterone (My sister has period cramps like my mom had when she was 
her age) so my sister is also more likely to have breast cancer in her 50's. This all seems like a bad dream or a bad trip. It's just too real for me. This is way too real. It's almost completely psychotic. My mom gave me this life for her to die. It's really sad. But I guess that's how it is for everyone, just in different ways."

I'll let my psychiatrist know. I don't need the 5mg IR tablets. I took 1g of phenibut which hasn't kicked in yet - It lifts my mood which wakes me up and also helps me sleep but I don't need it now.

175969843,"Metal Illness.... there are no easy answers when up is down and light is dark. I think it's most important to recognize what her triggers may or may not be, what medication if any is or isn't having an affect positive or negative, and perhaps most importantly what if anything calms her down. You and your father need to emphasize and reinforce her understanding of your love for her, and that it is her condition that blinds her and misleads her to feel unloved. Help her be comfortable talking openly about what happens when she loses it. What brings on this panic of rejection? Discuss feelings and emotions in terms of trigger words or phrases that may inadvertently upset her, and discuss safe words and phrases that remind her that she can be calm and in control, that she is always loved, avid she is not defined by her illness. As a former teacher, counselor, and manager; one of the time tested approaches to dealing with difficult outbursts, troubled minds, or more unpredictable personalities is to giv
e them more responsibility... that you need her help with this, not the other way around. It may sound a little like letting the inmates run the asylum, but put her in charge of your family approach. Empower her with this leadership role. Have her show you where to tack up the safe words and phrases all over your home, even frame them if you fancy or even paint rooms new colors she likes. The positives will come from incorporating her and making it more of a family effort that she takes charge of.... Responsibility instills esteem and confidence. Decide on a ""safe zone"" for her to go to in the house that makes her comfortable as you all work together making her (and yourselves) more comfortable. Let her be the architect of your family's tranquility. I hope my words may be of some help on this Mothers Day. Strength & Hope - cres"

175969851,"Some clarification -- perhaps. I am not clear on if it is actually BPD or just the consequence of being an ""adult from an abusive family"" since some of the behavior is similar. Some of the questions I cannot seem to find an answer for is 1) Can a BPD go 6 or 9 months in what one might call 'normal' relationship mode? I would agree this is a crossroads of sorts. I do live in another house but it is not accurate to say I make all the money she has a decent job with good benefits, I just have a greater income and financial assets. I have always viewed it as ""our"" money not caring to differentiate -- but there is a part of her that just cannot seem to ""put it all in one pool"" and honestly I have no issue with but then it suddenly becomes ""well I paid more taxes than you, so you owe me?"" I am only in a bind in so far as I care a great deal for her, and can clearly see there is an issue and from my viewpoint-- identifying the problem is 75% of the solution. Leaving is a simple solution. Even if i
t does reinforce in her mind ""See I told you-you would leave"". When she is not in this ""mode or whatever it is"" she is a wonderful woman, even if she does obsess over things most of us just move on about . Oddly enough you can actually see it on her face. If she has a conversation with her boss, even knowing she is highly respected and seen as very competent in her field, she will obsess over some inane comment her boss makes-- somehow trying to see it as a criticism. I laugh when I think of the untold hours I spend trying to reassure and reaffirm. If she were always like this or seeking outside attention leaving would happen without hesitation. So sure, leaving is an option but it would seem that the real test is ""can we fix this together?"" As a retired senior military officer, I am solutions oriented quitting is not my preferred course of action, but then staying on a needless battlefield when there is not a real potential of success is indeed foolish."

I can feel my brain morphing into this existential being. Not literally feel, but like sense or recognize, I mean. The whole past 5 years I’ve tried to keep my life superficial in my interests. Superficial, as in, not having my interests go deep like I did when I was sick. Because going too deep would cause psychosis. So I’d watch keeping up with kardashians, my 600 lb life, etc. Play stupid burner games like cheap games that only play to my interests for a week or so. I kinda kept away from books or read books that I already knew how they turned out, so it wouldn’t be a surprise to my psyche. Now...idk. I feel myself wanting to challenge myself again. Challenge my intelligence and build my knowledge. And For the first time in my life I’m actively reading a multitude of books. Not just one. And I’m actually reading them. Not just saying I a
m and hopefully meaning to get around to them. I wonder if it’s not a big deal to open my psyche/mind back open to new ideas about the world, or just to actively read the challenges of other people, etc, anything that challenges my brain capabilities/capacity. Not like reading/watching horror-type stuff that would put me into psychosis but just opening up to books that make me think deep again. No I’m not psychotic right now. If anything hypo, but this is something I that has been going on since I been in recovery. For a reason. When I would read my philosophy books again, I’d get into a conspiracy mode of thinking.

175969916,"So I've known this woman for almost two years. From the first time I saw her I knew there was something special about her. Last year we had a few attempts that fell through. It was just bad timing. She got involved with someone and I ""moved on"", while trying to remain friends. This spring she had some problems, at some point that relationship ended. I did what I could to support her. But, with the attempt at romancing her in my past, I was afraid my motives might be suspect. But it did lead to us slowly getting closer over the summer. In the fall we made plans to take a day trip together. It, didn't work out. Then we made some plans for dinner, they didn't work out. We made some plans for December, and also some plans to hang out. The hangout didn't work either. I tried several more times, but we just kept talking, and didn't get together. In our talk she showed me that she really is as special as I felt. I confessed those feelings to her. She said she wasn't interested in anyone right now. And a
sked to stay friends. Early December she hinted at developing a crush on me. I was afraid to move to soon and push her away. She slowed down how often she talked to me. The day of our plans came, and it was absolutely wonderful. It goes down as one of, if not the, best day of my life. It ended with a very nice hug. When she left I broke down into sobbing tears because I had never been that happy. She accidentally left something at my place, and said she would get it ""next time"". A few days later, she hinted that the dinner I had planned for Christmas sounded good. So I offered to cook it for her that night instead. She took me up on the offer. Then canceled 30 minutes before she was set to come over. It hurt, I asked if I could call her later, because I needed to talk to her about the effect all the cancelations were having on me. She didn't respond. I had a habit of telling her good morning and good night each day. She stopped replying to them to. Didn't respond over Christmas. The day after Christmas I wa
s just so tied up in knots I decided to do it through text. She didn't respond to that either. I saw her at work one day, neither of us had time to talk, but she seemed happy to see me. Then Monday I talked to my psychologist, she recommended that I give her space, stop sending good mornings/nights. My main worry was that any time in the past if I missed one, or wasn't as cheerful, she would get concerned. So I wrote an explanation for why I was stepping back. She didn't respond. The last words she's said to me were that she wouldn't be able to make it to dinner. She did post some things on her wall about depression. I did tell her good night that night, because I knew it would be something I miss. But the next morning I didn't even want to wake up... Just seemed pointless without saying good morning. And the next night was a living hell. She's an overthinker with depression. I understand that is probably why she cancels plans. And I feel horrible for confronting her about canceling again. Now I'm terrified t
hat at some point I hurt her, and this was the final straw. She hasn't blocked me, she still opens my messages. She just doesn't respond anymore. It's killing me, because... She's... I've never met anyone like her. The warmth I feel when I'm around her, it burns away everything else. For those precious moments I actually forget other people exist. I live in that moment. I'm still quiet and shy, but I'm not worried about the future... or reliving the past. The only thing that matters to me is right there. Not feeling her presence the world feels cold and dark, lightless and hopeless."

174361426,"I have a very first-world problem. I'm a well-to-do professional but I'm haunted by what some would call paranoid delusions. I'm certain that if I go somewhere to complain they just stuck me full of drugs because that's what the doctors do in my country. My basic problem is that I believe I'm haunted by my ex who prohibits me from all normal life, tries to control my life, relationships etc. My current problem for some five years is that my dad is an asshole and I would otherwise break up with him, but this asshole-ex prohibits me from that and ruins my life and prohibits all normal working life etc. Doesn't sound that sane, right? The problem with my ex is that I believe she's kind of sorry for ruining the earlier part of my life - my twenties - and then breaking up with me, and then she is trying to pull the strings behind the scenes and control my life to kind of redeem herself a good conscience. (Doesn't sound that plausible, right?) The problem with my dad is that he is a complete, utter assho
le. It's only that my ex has realized he has money and that's why she's trying to intervene. I would really like my dad beaten up. He e.g. raped my mom. How do I know? Well, mom tells this and dad would of course deny. How do I know which to believe? Well, dad boasts all the time how he cheats all his women (concubines), so I believe he's kind of into cheating. I also suspect he's abused my sister when she was under-age, but I don't have any real evidence, and who would believe the word of a schizophrenic anyway? Because that's how my sister ended up, for some time at least. She was hospitalized a couple of times. I've OF COURSE forgiven him all this because mom could've broken up with him earlier and I don't have any real evidence for the sister case. That's how I try to rationalize... Another thing is that he's a complete utter asshole also towards me. He's a toxic narcissist who puts me down for everything I do. He likes me to succeed in life and make a lot of money... but not really succeed and not to mak
e too much money, least he becomes envious. So that's why he sabotages everything I do. The best thing for him would be to have me to make five times less than he does, to live in smaller house and to date an uglier, less educated woman and to be entirely dependent on him because that's the way he could boss around with me for the rest of his life. All too bad I'm 38 and my professional career's practically ruined by this ex fantasy. I genuinely believe that my ex has mailed some of my supervisors and collagues and that's why they started to avoid collaboration with me, and that's why I've made a series of very, very bad career moves. So I guess I'm going to tell all of this to a psychiatrist right tomorrow!"
175969923,"That can't be a comfortable feeling. I've been there kind of. Most of my friends, if I drop off, they don't reach out or anything. Just leave me alone. So if I get depressed and stop texting or calling them, no one calls or texts me. It's like I don't exist. They all have other friends, I guess, and just forget about me. Every now and then, I will get a message from someone, asking where I've been, but those are rare. It's not fun to know you are easily replaceable... Or that you are the replacement all the time, like oh, I'll use you to fill my hole, but then when they find a new person, you get dropped again. Been there too. I'm sorry you're there right now. I wish your friend(s) were a little more understanding of what you need."

175969931,"My wife, strangely, feels guilty over many things. Leaving me, the death of her father, being of mixed race, having acne etc. I think it's possible to get over it. Probably takes time though...my wife's condition seems more serious, so she takes A LOT of time to get over anything...and probably hasn't let go of certain things, which is of course detrimental to one's mental health. Don't beat yourself up over past actions. The illness is a major contributing factor for whatever things you have done before. I'm sure your hubby has forgiven you for anything and everything, like I have for my wife. If you still find it hard to let go, try praying to God. With God, all things are possible!"

175969944,"I think the situation may have been miscommunicated here. I did something that was perceived to be possibly dodgy and it was flagged. It has been investigated and those batting my corner have waved it away. Something similar came to light afterwards and so it was brought up again. The question of my character/intent came up after that. The conversation was with a mentor who is batting for me. We had a quiet conversation about it and what's happening and what I need to do and he was giving the the inside scoop of what the others involved in the decision are thinking, where they are in the process, etc. Our conversation on be being reserved I think was good in intent. He said it wasn't a problem but that it might be better if I allowed others to engage with me more personally. Explicitly, he's said that he's quite happy for me to do my thing and go home. On the other hand, he said, it leaves me in situations like this where people don't know where to stand because they don't have a firm impression of 
me even after a couple of years. I came into the company and immediately was a top sales performer. I've been consistently the best since I got here and then there is murmur about it not all being above board. It's clear how that can lead to suspicion, especially if all they have to go off is a stellar sales record, reputation of somebody who has turned up to work high and slept around but otherwise no contact beyond talking to people who've been upset by my having ghosted them. The rest, about isolation, I think was just an offering of advice he wish he'd had at my age. I don't resent it and won't be seeking recourse for somebody explaining how they have related to the way I think and later have found that they were missing something then telling me that it may be worth considering if I am missing out too. The claims for my attention and to get to know me from coworkers aren't a pervasive issue nor is my reluctance to be involved (most of the time, since I do engage on some level). It was just an observation 
that's been gently made to me as a reminder that I might have an easier time if I was more open to volunteering myself. It's a valid point. If I had done that, the precarious situation wouldn't be, since there'd be more confidence in my character if people felt they know me better. I only really bothered with people I was interested in and it's clear how that might be an issue. I'm sure he doesn't think I'm on the verge of breakdown I think he just wanted to open up to me and let me know something private and personal that not many others know, in a show of trust and extension of an _NAME_ branch for me to have somebody there if I need it, even if I don't think I will."

If you experience new or unexplained pain, pressure or discomfort in the center of your chest or in your arms, back, jaw, neck or upper stomach — along with shortness of breath, a cold sweat, nausea, fatigue or lightheadedness — for at least five minutes, call 911. These symptoms may signal a heart attack, or myocardial infarction. Immediate treatment is essential to save heart muscle. But when chest aches and pains are fleeting, it’s often something different. Symptoms that suggest another problem Cardiologist _NAME_, MD, notes that the following symptoms are unlikely to signal a heart attack: 1. Momentary chest discomfort, often characterized as a lightning bolt or electrical shock. Heart discomfort or pain is unrelenting, typically for several minutes. Momentary chest discomfort is more likely to result from musculoskeletal injury or inflammation, or nerve pain (e.g., a cracked rib, 
a pulled muscle in the chest wall or shingles involving the chest.) 2. Pinpoint chest discomfort that worsens with positional changes in breathing. Heart pain is usually diffuse, or radiating. Pinpoint discomfort that worsens with chest expansion (breathing, for instance) is more likely to involve the lungs. 3. Chest discomfort that gets better with exercise. Heart-related pain typically worsens with exercise. Sharp chest pain that improves with movement is more likely to have other causes (e.g., acid reflux.)"

175969972,I’m sorry you’re going through such a difficult time. I think it can be easy to put the blame for someone else’s actions on ourselves. You take care of you. Seek your happiness and purpose. That may or may not include him. You get to choose. Be Bold.
175969973,I used to take .5 mg of Ativan (lorazepam) for a few years every night just to help me sleep and I took it for panic attacks.

I have a different dr now who won’t prescribe me but a few at a time for panic attacks. I am ok with that and have ambien to help with sleep. If it helps you cope then I wouldn’t worry about the risks of being on it. That’s just my opinion though.

175969984,"I think all of us who long to be mothers feel this way at some point. Why do you think you will have postpartum depression (PND)? If you have high risk factors for it, do you have family support and what is the mother health support like in your area? I was average risk because of family history - I had had no depression but 3 of my siblings have it. When I was pregnant with my first because of my profession and that I was older everyone around me thought I was likely to get it. So after he was born they were all gently watching for signs, about once a week someone would pop in with a meal for us. However I was fine, I was so happy to finally be a mum and have had a healthy normal baby. Despite lack of sleep ( he didn't sleep through until 4years!!), which can kick PND off in people with no genetic history, I was ok. So we had number two 17 months later, this time only my new midwife was worried about PND but I was okay-ish. Remember if mums are honest most of us are really only ok-ish after the ba
by is born! Then when he was about 5 months old too many things happened at once - my eldest become a terror tot (normal toddler behaviour)my husband was away for work overseas for weeks at a time and both boys got croup, one after the other. So I got little sleep for weeks as I listened to their breathing all night long. Then I got full blown PND. My boys are 11 and 12, they are great, I am not 100% all the time but with light dose meds, friends to talk to and doing things that make me happy more often I am mostly ok. Which is realistic I think! Before you give up on your dream of a family, assess your support networks. How helpful will your husband be - be realistic here and do not expect too much - I thought mine would be great but alas no, did not got understand my depression at all, probably made me feel worse!! Do you have family who will help if things are hard - and if they are not? Are there people around you you trust to keep an eye out for you? I have been teaching for 20 years in some pretty tough 
areas and wealthy too, I have met very few terrible parents. Aside from addicts the worst parents are the selfish ones who cannot put their children first, who do not seem to be able to show them love with time. You already love the children you want to have, you'll be okay."

175969986,"As for the psychologist conversation, some psychologists know their limits and respect them. Some don’t. My psychologist told me straight out she doesn’t know much about bipolar and psychosis, she’s just going to deal with my anxiety. Totally fair and I appreciate that she admitted what she couldn’t help me with rather than guess. I’ve always personally been interested in psychology. I’m taking psychology as my minor in university now. I have no intention of going into the mental health field, I’m more interested in the mind in relation to how it works in business and making decisions. Stuff like that. Of course, I’m interested in abnormal psychology because I’m personally affected by it, but I wouldnt try to say I’m an expert on it or anything."

175969993,"today was bad for most of it, but got better towards the ending. i felt so empty and lost today, and i was so nauseous for most of the day. after my classes, i prayed and tried to go to sleep, but had to go to the doctor. i tried talking to my mom about how i felt, and i told her that ive been feeling like throwing up, and that i cant breathe. at first, she blamed it on the fact that im fasting. that really upset me because i knew it was because of my anxiety. when it was time to eat dinner, i had a huge panic attack. i couldnt last 5 mins at the dinner table surrounded by my family, without crying. i left to the bathroom, and just sat there for a while. my mom realized there was something wrong but this time blamed it on my accutane pills. so even though i know my pills arent the cause f my physical state, i still took her advice about them. i couldnt eat the entire day, and i felt like i couldnt breathe. i hadnt gotten any texts or calls from any one of my friends, and i was completely alone for 
the whole day. i gave in to my stubbornness at the end and texted one of my friends and told her how i felt, and i dont even remember how it happened, but she calmed me down. she motivated me and told me to maybe get back on social media, since i was off for while, because even tho i hate it, it's a good distraction. towards midnight, i talked to some of my friends for a bit, and my best friend was able to cheer me up, and distract me with some work he needed done, which i did for him. i am currently in a very average, relaxed mood, so despite how bad the entire day was, the end of the day came out okay, which really helped calm me down, and i was able to eat multiple snacks. im glad."

175970001,"Oh such pain _PERSON_. That's a hard one and I've thought and thought. I don't believe in ""bad mouthing"" my ex where my children would be able to hear. I feel that no matter what we went through, it's not there fault and even though he was a dead beat dad, he's still their dad and they have that right to ""make believe"" he's the best. I figured when they get older they will ""see"" for themselves. When they use to ask me why we got divorced, I would tell them that ""that is between your dad and I. The main thing is that we both love you"". My situation really doesn't help with your daughter. Although my ex would tell me that our son (born 2 months early) was not his and that I was just a ***** for the first 16 months of my son's life. (I left when I was visably pregnant and filed for divorce). If I were you I would tell her that her dad just wasn't ready to be a daddy. But that you love her enough for both a mommy and daddy. Then leave it at that. Both my parents died when I was 2. I was never t
old anything about them except for a few negative things. My mother's sister raised me. Once I moved out she has never really had anything to do with me. I hope this helps you. I've said a prayer for you and your daughter. Does she have any male role models she can look up to? Someone that can show her ""guy"" stuff? Changing a tire, fixing simple things, just different stuff that is typically left for men to do. My ex didn't teach our two children really anything and my youngest son's dad passed when he was 11. I taught them what I knew, cooking, cleaning, how to patch a hole in the wall, camping, edible plants grown in the wild, how to shave. But there are things I wish they would have had a man to teach them. I hope I didn't step out of bounds by adding that last part. Just trying to help. Have a wonderful week, _NAME_"

What can I do besides give it time though. At least I'm sleeping better without Benadryl now. Plus, I have back ups of Remeron for nights that are difficult. I'm going to wean myself down on the benzo I have though. Starting tonight, I'm just going to take 15mgs. I'm going to lower my Geodon to 120mgs while I'm at it.

175970012,"It's good that you’re writing in. You said, “I can hear my heart beating in my ear,” under that title in the search engine, Health.harvard.edu says: “A. What (the patient who wrote into the Harvard website) describe(s) sounds like pulsatile tinnitus (pronounced TIN-nih-tus or tin-NITE-us). It is a type of rhythmic thumping, pulsing, throbbing, or whooshing only you can hear that is often in time with the heartbeat. ""Most people with pulsatile tinnitus hear the sound in one ear, though some hear it in both. The sound is the result of turbulent flow in blood vessels in the neck or head. The most common causes of pulsatile tinnitus include the following: (included) high blood pressure What is your blood pressure? Net says normal is below 120 (top number) and below 80. Elevated is 120-129 and below 80. High is 130-139 and 80-89. Things which can make tinnitus (ear condition) worse are: Alcohol, caffeine, sugar, nicotine, loud noise. Because I have tinnitus (ringing in the ears), I know those t
hings can make it worse and from seeing that on the net. Again, the website said it’s usually heard in one ear, and you said, “One morning last week I woke up hearing my heartbeat in my left ear” You said, “I have been having chest pain for a couple of weeks now on and off. Yes I went to dr. But she said it’s from my anxiety tensing up my chest walls and stress can cause it too. So my question is for those who have had a heart attack. How can I tel the difference between heart attack or just stress pain ????” I have chest pain from time to time, the last time about a month ago, and when it gets bad enough, I just go to the ER. I’ve done that 4 or 5 times and they test me and then tell me I’m OK. But what Health.harvard.edu says is: Heart attack: sensation of pain, or of pressure, tightness, squeezing, or burning; the gradual onset of pain over the course of a few minutes; pain that extends to the left arm, neck, jaw, or back; pain or pressure that appears during or after physical exertion or e
motional stress or while you are at rest. Symptoms that are less likely to be heart attack include: sharp or knifelike pain brought on by breathing or coughing; sudden stabbing pain that lasts only a few seconds; pain clearly on one side or another; pain confined to one small spot; pain that lasts for many hours or days without any other symptoms; pain reproduced by pressing on the chest or with body movement. You said, “I am in stressful situation my anxiety is through the roof.” I, also, think that is what causes a lot of my chest pain. You said, “No I’m very negative person and always think the worst. I have always been like this. _NAME_ I feel so scared and alone even though I’m married with children.” This website stresses positive thinking as part of the healing process. They call it CBT (Cerebral Behavior Therapy). I’ve found that positive thinking helps me tremendously after having come across a column on being positive before you go into a problem that you can solve it. This sets you un
conscious to looking for victory, rather than defeat, which is the way we were raised. So, it's not just a mystical way of thinking, including when you have an illness, that you're going to a speedy recovery. It sets your mind to looking for ways to solve the problem, including when you're trying to recovered from a medical situation. Were you raised in a negative household? Medicalnewstoday.com says one of the possible side-effects of Escitalopram is racing heartbeat, high or low b/p. Do you have a psychiatrist? When do you see them next? How long have you been on Escitalopram?"

175970024,"Well that's one of the main ""potential trap ahead"" types of things that he talks about, for good reason. The role of structure is to eliminate that need to force yourself to get into any particular kind of mood to begin with. Any intended mood (or needed mood, like ""the mood to sleep"") is supposed to be elicited by the structure itself. It's not about one activity leading into another. That's optional. It's about the setting. If you spend time ""getting in the mood to do things"", then you really are wasting your time. That's the whole point. The more consistent your structure is, the less you need to think about doing things, and the more you just do them. But if you lack structure, then you need to create it first. And figuring it out when you don't have it isn't an easy task, because you have no baseline to compare to. That's where physical activity enters the scene. It's a reliable anchor. So it's the opposite of ""life hacks"", it's foundations. I think it's particularly important for anyo
ne dealing with daily apathy. Because aimlessness tends to average out into more apathy. When you compartmentalize drudgery from enjoyment consistently, you get to actually enjoy the enjoyment, even if it's outweighed by the drudgery on the whole. And you get to get the drudgery done without any expectations that it could or should be enjoyable, you just do it and forget about it. You don't get that if your subconscious isn't convinced that you're in the right setting for each of those ""moods"". We're all _PERSON_ dogs, and it pays to remember it."

Step off that path that is taking you deeper into the darkness and move toward the light....light of awareness, love, and more ease.....and for goodness sake, get a good support person to cheer you on....preferably an objective one.

175970052,"I don't need alone time the way an introvert does to recharge their batteries. I've never had that necessity. I choose to be alone out of detachment for the people I meet, there's no drive to build a long term relationship with them, so I don't stick around. I also find a lot of people either dull or annoying, so that contributes. In general, socializing is energizing for me, though it becomes an energy deficit when there's a lack of drive(which would make sense). Despite these things, I'm on the rather extreme end of social alienation out of my own volition, but I also enjoy meeting new, interesting people. So for me, it's only about stimulation seeking, however that may be."

175970094,"It seems that reaching out to find both a place of expression and a community of support are great ways to progress forward into better states of being. Seeing as your perception is that everyone is against you (extremely common with your symptoms) I would consult a case worker about being discriminated by your partner and his family and ask that your primary focus to be on resolving that relationship struggle. It's extremely common for a mentally ill patient to experience what you're describing and worse from the other people in their lives. Reaching out to those who understand the various sides of you that may emerge during an episode, even hypo-manic, is possible, including if necessary going to a shelter for battered women (even if the battering is mostly psychological.) If you can manage to strike out on your own, even going back to Mississippi if you prefer, that would probably be a good idea even if you're trying to salvage your current relationship after some distance.

175970099,My new job has been creating a lot of anxiety for me lately. Thinking about work makes me anxious. I’m starting to hate Sundays and Mondays. My boss isn’t that nice and the kids I work with can be challenging. Everyday I feel like I can’t do it and want to just walk away. I don’t know what to do because I really need this job.
175970100,No I dont luckily
175970101,"I am now taking medication regularly, which I think causes the telepathy to go a bit. Though I was wondering if other people on this forum have ever heard my thoughts. I believe that everyone on earth can hear my thoughts if I am taking a low dosage of medication, or none at all. I hear people, especially children on the pavement outside, or playing in playgrounds screaming what the voices have just said, or what I just thought. I hear a few regular voices, including people I know and famous people or anyone I think of briefly, being absolutely horrible to me! I am a Chinese girl in my early 40s. So please could you tell me if you have ever heard my thoughts. I would be immensely interested if you even slightly believe you might have heard my thoughts, or if you haven't. If you have heard them, please let me know, as I would very much like to be aware of it and please could you tell me what you heard? Thank you."

174361709,"I'll share as well. with my experiences with the disorder it started in my teens. i started hearing voices. i don't really experience the visual hallucinations, but i do experience the voices. i was scared to take the drugs once it got bad. i heard stories from friends about them and how they could numb your feelings. I luckily lived in a home where i had a good support system in place. My family got educated on the disorder, and also some people in my family in the past have had the disorder or symptoms of it at least. the voices would say that i'm worthless, and such. i did have suicidal thoughts at one point when it got more serious and consumed a lot of my life. some people didn't take what i said seriously and invalidated my feelings that were in my life. i'm glad that over time it has gotten better and im not in rock bottom anymore. schizophrenia is a newer concept and still misunderstood a lot by society. it still has a lot of _USER_ID_ behind it, due to people not knowing what it is. i hope 
there is more awareness in the future of what it is, instead of people who have it getting the ""crazy"" label which invalidates us further."

175970118,"I didn’t know the severity of my fiancé’s mental health until we moved in together, and throughout the course of our relationship I haven’t seen any consistent improvement. My fiancé is bipolar and at times suicidal. Sometimes I’m not sure if he has his episodes as a means to feel like I care for him, but recently I thought the outcome was going to be different. I’m not sure how much longer I can be in this without telling him I cannot see us getting married...he isn’t completely blind to what’s going on and after the other night I told him he needed to focus on himself, not us. I love him so much and I want him to live the life he deserves, and to find peace within himself. I know he is incapable of giving me what I need in a relationship—we’ve spoken many times about it. Currently, I’m helping him form healthy habits such as positive affirmations in the morning to get him in a better headspace because he was so hopeless. He won’t take his therapy session on the phone, so I 
don’t have a choice but to offer some type of hope. I’m in an odd position here. I’m not asking for self-pity because part of me feels selfish to complain given what he’s going through. However, I envisioned an entirely different future and now I’m playing psychologist which can be uncomfortable. I know I still have to heal emotionally; I’m just trying to find guidance in when to address more thoroughly how I’m feeling. I don’t want him to dive off the deep end..."

I think I’ll always be on Clonazepam, unless I can find an antidepressant or something that can help with the panic symptoms that isn’t addictive. I’m going off Escitalopram and should be off in the next few days. If I have any emotional episodes, I’ll be put on Lamictal but it’ll be interesting to see if it helps or not with the information you gave me. How is Abilify for you? Does it have any negative side effects such as muscle tremors or stuff? I’m scared to try antipsychotics since I am not sure that I have a mood disorder and my psychiatrist is against it for now but I have a feeling I may be trying them at some point, as the traditional treatment of SSRIs and SNRIs have made me worse."
175970122,"Here is the major, major problem (in my view). My graduate program is in Argentina. I am in the States now. I didn't have much contact except in class with the grad students before even when I was in Argentina. I've been isolated for like two years. My parents don't understand and just want me to get the damned degree. This is about the most isolated I've ever felt in my life though. So I not only physically cannot hang out with the grad students in my class (because they're in a different country), but also I wouldn't ordinarily hang out with them anyway unless it's a day we have class. We only have class one day a week. Wow. Saying all this really makes me want to quit. On top of that, school is on Saturday for 8 hours straight on Zoom. Talk about awful. Moreover, I have to get up at 6am where I live to make class on time. On top of that, they haven't given me the grades in all of the classes I've done well in and passed. I just really, really want to quit. The isolation stuff is really getting t

I apologize for its directness but hope that it may have value to readers, whether or not anyone feels like responding to it. How likely does anyone think it is that, with age, schizoids lose the boredom with their own personalities which _PERSON_ has described above? Becoming either subtly inured to the dissatisfaction, or even possibly mistakenly reattributing that dissatisfaction to the external world? As sucky as Reality and The Other oftentimes are, one has to admit that both keep our brains and muscles from atrophying. Unfortunately, it's often impossible to control that fire hose Otherness dispenser. I hardly leave the house and, when I do, need plenty of down time to recover."

For the hot flashes I dressed in thin layers so I could remove if I had to. But for night sweats, there isn't a lot you can do. I would always wake up drenched. I would be hot and then cold because I was wet. I didn't take any hormones to help. But it wasn't that bad for me except for the nights. But that lasted a few months and went away. I hope you find something to make it easier. We are all different so the symptoms and severity of them vary. I wish you the best and hope that it goes by quick for you.

175970176,"It's so weird that YouTube, in my Google search for the site, showed up with a live concert of Prince and the Revolution. I remember when he died. I don't remember who told me, I don't remember where I was, unlike _NAME_, unlike _NAME_, but _PERSON_ death was the hardest for me to register. I kept seeing his videos pop up after he died, and I'd think, ""Oh, I hope he comes here! I'd love to see him live!"" Like, I was like for a year after he died. I'm not even that big of a _PERSON_ fan, I just think Purple Rain is one of the best albums ever made. Other than that, he has a lot of hot garbage. Sure, 1999 and Sign of the Times are good albums, but he peaked with Purple Rain, and once he found God, his music suffered and never recovered. With _PERSON_ and with _NAME_, what many people consider to be their best albums (Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars for _PERSON_ and Thriller for MJ) are there, but they grew as artists. ""Bad"" is a better album than ""Thriller"", and ""Dangerous"" is a damn 
good album too. There are so many good _PERSON_ albums that came after _PERSON_ that I'm not even going to list them. Once I registered that _PERSON_ died, I was all, ""eh,"" on him. From what I've read, he wasn't the nicest person. _PERSON_ I don't know if he was a nice person or not, and everyone has an opinion on _NAME_, especially of the accusations, and I'm not going to give my thoughts because I don't want to start an argument or possibly offend anyone. Yes yes _PERSON_ best song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkNl3pq1twE _PERSON_ best song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmtL3RxiVjc I could put the entire ""Bad"" album here, as I think it's the best album of modern day music ever made, but I'll go with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm2BsOnAYcM _USER_ID_ TO ADD: There are albums I enjoy more than _PERSON_ ""Bad"", but I think it's the best album ever made because it's so diverse in it's sound. Sure, other albums are diverse in their sound, but Bad does it better than those albums. Someone onc
e said to me that WHAM's ""Make it Big"" was a better album. I have both on vinyl. (WHAM vinyls are like, a dollar on eBay) Other than ""Heartbeat"" off the WHAM album, I couldn't care less. Careless Whisper is obscenely overrated, and _NAME_ never really grabbed my attention, other than him pulling his private parts out in public and being arrested for it more than once. His solo career was atrocious, and no one knows the name of the other guy in WHAM. An example of an album that I enjoy is _PERSON_ ""Painkiller"". I think it's a flawless album, but I still think ""Bad"" is a better album. A metal album that's a tad more obscure than that is King Diamond's ""_NAME_,"" which is another perfect album, but it's all fast paced metal music with King _PERSON_ wide-ranged vocals. Yes yes. I'm bored with this."

They don't usually arrive til 11:30 or later. i don't even really know what kind of help i want. i guess accepting feelings."

Like confidence, self-esteem, possible borderline, delusions, dysphoria and depression, mania, etc. It's not your fault. You've had a bad life (Worst trauma I've seen in a person), family, bad circumstances, ****** card in life. When people leave you, it has to do with them. Not you. Some people don't have a personality. I've met many of them online. They go into chats and say ""asl?"" and I once decided to troll people that were doing ""Rollplay"" by putting gore into it until they log out. I've been a moderator in every forum, game, sever, chat I've ever been except here. You have a strong personality like me.

I don't need to focus at work. The problem is that the first dose is when I'm the most focused and productive.. I put 80mg of CBD under my tongue and I feel very relaxed and content. I just feel lost at this point. I'm not sure what to do. Other people have it worse during COVID though. Although I've been struggling a lot - Still in a good mental state. I'm 1/4 of the way finished my book. If I don't start reading, I say ""Just read ONE chapter"" and that seems to work. One chapter a day. I have a few things planned to do.. I keep having to organize my passwords, notes, etc.. I'm thinking of buying a new phone soon - Maybe the Samsung Fold 2 idk.. I feel hopeful and optimistic about the future as long as people don't put me down. Too tired to play guitar or piano. I like to play in the morning because that's when I can focu
s better. So far so good. I'm out of Ashwagandha and that stuff seems to really help me - Although it can potentially mess with hormones so I'm not sure about taking it anymore. I have some arriving soon along with sarcosine and NAC to help with negative symptoms. I still have the ket nasal spray but I'm not gonna use it for a while until my dp/dr goes away. I just want to be better and not in hell. I have a vacation planned in the next few weeks - Going to Vancouver Island to visit my relatives. I'll enjoy the car/jeep ride. I love being in a car.. Maybe it's an autistic thing but I would sit in my dads jeep to read if it was a normal thing to do.. I might do it anyways eventually. I'm looking forward to a break from being in this town - I'm not very good at talking to people again because of anxiety and AvPD so the psychedelic novelty effect must be wearing off.

I feel tired of keeping up this charade of life.

I was doing a job for sometimes 16 hours in one day that others would get paid for 40 dollars and hour. I was getting paid 11 dollars. I asked one boss to increase my pay by a dollar but he said ""Ask *other manager*"" so I asked him and he referred me back to the first boss. Then I stopped my welding apprentice. I was young - Just went into what ever people told me. I thought to myself, who am I going to work for? Myself? I don't want a family so I'm just going to be doing 9-5 every day until I'm 65 and then what will I do on the weekends? I don't want to party like everyone else. They weren't letting me weld - Just making me pick up pieces of metal and sort them out, sweep the floor (Just like I did for 3 years in the mechanics shop and I was too young for them to let me do the mechanics work - Just cleaning out 
oil and chemical vacuum trucks which could give me cancer later in life) It just wasn't for me. One guy kept telling me to smile. They were treating me like **** and thought that they were so much better than me. I completely wasted my time."

No snacking for her between her meals. Only chicken broth. That's okay. She wasn't eating when she was at the vet hospital. We dropped off some chicken broth and she ate.

174361784,"Gang Stalking: Real-Life Harassment or Textbook Paranoia? | Psychology Today What Is Gang Stalking? Reports of “gang stalking"" (a.k.a. ""gang-stalking"" or ""gangstalking"") began emerging at least 15 years ago by self-described “targeted individuals” (“T.I.s”) claiming to be followed, surveilled, harassed, and otherwise victimized by unknown forces wielding high-tech weapons of “mind control.” Since then, much more has been written about this phenomenon, especially over the past few years, with national attention devoted to a few notable cases of violence and mass shootings perpetrated by people identifying as T.I.s.1 These journalistic accounts—in the mainstream press, as well as in self-publication sites like Medium.com and two Vice documentary features (for a chronological bibliography, see the references section at the end of this blogpost)—offer intimate, sympathetic, and compelling portraits of those who identify as victims of gang stalking. By way of summary, T.I.s typica
lly describe living in a state of constant fear, seeing evidence of being followed by unmarked police cars in every black SUV that drives by, of being zapped by “extremely low-frequency” (ELF) radiation or “Voice to Skull” (V2K) technology in every tingling sensation or bodily ache, and of malevolent intentions in other people’s every gesture. Interviews often note that T.I.s don’t appear “unusual,” “disheveled,” or otherwise “crazy” and that some of them are doctors, acclaimed novelists, and other reasonably well-functioning professionals. Indeed, the T.I. community is comprised of thousands of diverse individuals, coming from all walks of life, with similarly diverse accounts of who might be harassing them and why. For example, the “who” is variably attributed to neighbors, ex-boyfriends, employers, police and other law enforcement agencies, “the financial elite,” or less conventional sources, like Freemasons and space aliens. The “why” is often attributed to retaliation 
for ending relationships, acting as whistleblowers at work, political activism, having run-ins with the law, or being privy to secret information. Seemingly motiveless harassment is chalked up to being hapless victims of experimentation by government agencies testing new techniques of surveillance or mind control. If there’s a common thread to the accounts of gang stalking, it’s that T.I.s describe considerable suffering not only as a result of ongoing concerns about being harassed, but also from the experience of physical symptoms, like pain and “hearing voices,” and the significant social _USER_ID_ associated with sharing their claims with family, friends, or mental health professionals who routinely dismiss them as “crazy.” As a result, T.I.s have found solace on the internet, where they share ""war stories"" and survival strategies with like-minded individuals who have similarly found themselves at the center of a vast conspiracy theory. _NAME_/Pixabay Source: _NAME_ The Subjective Reality of 
Paranoia Of course, stalking by a single individual is a dangerous reality for some—especially women fleeing abusive relationships and other targets of erotomania. And bullying by a group of individuals (a.k.a. “mobbing”) is increasingly recognized as a school and workplace hazard. In an episode called ""Trust Fall,"" the NPR Invisibilia podcast recently highlighted a seemingly improbable case of internet harassment that turned out to be real after all. A recent New York Times article detailed another real-life case of ""cyberstalking"" and in-person surveillance by employees at eBay. And yes, a few real events in history, such as the CIA’s MK-Ultra “mind control” program and the FBI’s COINTELPRO surveillance program of the 1950s, have occurred, just as the modern-day mass manipulation of human behavior through social media is a reality in which we all now live. But if you aren’t personally experiencing gang stalking, it’s hard for an outsider, much less a psychiatrist, to accept it as anyth
ing other than a textbook example of paranoia. Indeed, that’s been the conclusion of the few mental health researchers that have examined gang stalking to date. In 2006, Dr. _NAME_ Bell and colleagues published an analysis of 10 online accounts of “mind control experiences” consistent with gang stalking (though they didn’t mention that word explicitly).2 When assessed by three independent psychiatrists, all of the accounts were classified as consistent with the evidence of a psychotic disorder. In 2015, Drs. _NAME_ and _NAME_ conducted an analysis of 128 responses to a survey about stalking that similarly concluded that 100 percent of cases involving gang stalking by multiple coordinated individuals reflected paranoid delusions (in contrast, only 4 percent of those reporting stalking by a single individual were deemed to be delusional).3 In both of these studies, gang stalking claims were attributed to paranoia because they defied credulity, often due to the sheer amount of resources or level of coord
inated organization that would be necessary to carry out what was claimed. As a psychiatrist, it’s nearly impossible to disagree with those conclusions. Delusions are defined in psychiatry as “fixed, false beliefs,” with paranoia representing a classic version in which one believes they’re being followed, harassed, or otherwise persecuted. Vigilance—keeping an eye out for and being generally wary of potential threats—is normal and can transform into exaggerated hypervigilance under various conditions, such as having been an actual victim of violence. At the extreme, full-blown paranoia of delusional intensity can be understood as that same evolutionary warning system gone completely awry, to the point of seeing the evidence and believing that such threats are almost everywhere. And despite stigmatizing stereotypes about psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, those whose paranoia is part of “delusional disorder”—where “non-bizarre” or plausible delusions are the only symptoms—don’t t
ypically appear “bizarre or odd” and have functioning that’s relatively intact, according to traditional diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). (For an excellent portrayal of what it’s like to be married to someone with delusional disorder, listen to this episode of This American Life called “You Can’t Handle The Truth.”) This helps to explain why, aside from their idiosyncratic beliefs, many T.I.s don’t appear obviously psychotic—there is no such thing! But digging deeper tells a different story. Many T.I.s report concerns not only about gang stalking but other common symptoms of mental illness, such as auditory hallucinations or voice-hearing and even less plausible beliefs, such as having “implants” inside their bodies that can control their thoughts or that people have been replaced by aliens. But even those with “pure” paranoia appear to display textbook examples of delusional thinking. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with hun
dreds if not thousands of people with paranoid delusions, including but not limited to those who have claimed to be victims of gang stalking. In such cases, claims of persecution defy credulity on several grounds. First, there’s the unbelievably vast extent of what’s claimed… fleets of black SUVs with tinted windows, persecutors in disguise on every street corner, and futuristic secret technology being deployed from God knows where. Second, there’s a lack of any obvious or credible motive for the persecution… why would the CIA be devoting considerable resources to keep an “average _NAME_” under constant surveillance for years on end (note that paranoia and grandiosity—an exaggerated sense of self-importance—often go hand-in-hand)? Third, the persecutory experiences continue regardless of attempts to escape or relocate, including when hospitalized in the inpatient psychiatry ward, and are contradicted by acquaintances or family and friends living in close proximity. And so, by process of elim
ination as well as recognition as a textbook case, paranoid delusions often offer the best explanation for most gang stalking claims. Of course, it’s the rule rather than the exception that people with delusional disorder avoid being labeled as mentally ill and spurn referrals to psychiatry. But one more thing that can help to clarify that persecutory concerns are delusional is that paranoia often resolves when its underlying causes are actually treated, whether by participating in psychotherapy that challenges cognitive distortions in the face of evidence, taking medications for psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, or stopping the use of illicit drugs well-known to cause paranoia, like methamphetamines, cocaine, and sometimes marijuana or alcohol (many benefit from a combination of these interventions). Once treated, people sometimes develop insight that the experience wasn’t real after all and is best explained by paranoia. But just as often, a delusional belief may not be fully relinquished as an ex
planation for past events, so much as someone is simply relieved and thankful that for whatever reason, the persecution has stopped. Beliefs, whether those of T.I.s or psychiatrists, are ultimately probability judgments where the distinction between a delusion and a normal belief is the difference between what could be true and what's likely to be true and the associated level of conviction for that judgment. By definition, people with delusions hold beliefs with unwarranted levels of conviction, with the main “evidence” for the belief lying almost exclusively within the subjective experience. They often reason that “I can’t be crazy because it seems so real” (if they didn’t, they wouldn’t be delusional—in other words, if you believe you’re paranoid, you’re not!). By way of contrast, clinicians assessing delusions must be open to and investigate the potential reality of seemingly unfounded beliefs (recall that in Dr. _NAME_’s study, 96 percent of individual stalking claims were judged to 
be real), making probabilistic judgments based on objective evidence. By most accounts, gang stalking doesn’t hold up to such objective analysis for anyone other than those experiencing it. That’s the confounding reality of delusions—they’re ultimately grounded in subjective experience, whereas the truth is objective. Serving in the privileged position of authority as an arbiter of what’s credible or not—of the truth—requires that one be open-minded about what’s possible in the universe, aware of the breadth of culturally sanctioned beliefs, and humble about the limits of human knowledge. And so, rather than succumbing to the binary bias, perhaps we should consider whether gang stalking might not be quite so black and white after all. Maybe it’s not as simple as a question of paranoia or not. In Part 2 of this series, ""Gang Stalking: Conspiracy, Delusion, and Shared Belief,"" I’ll examine a third possibility, revisiting the intersection of conspiracy theories and shared delusions in the d
igital age.

Tried it once and did a little longer than 2.5 minutes so tried again and came out perfect. Added butter popcorn seasoning salt and put peanut m and m’s in the popcorn as really like chocolate candy in the popcorn.

175970254,"I have health anxiety as well. It is under control now, but it took a lot of work. Here are some suggestions: Say good-bye and good riddance to Dr. _PERSON_. Googling your symptoms will only show you the worst case scenarios. You can’t do this alone. Find a good CBT therapist. Every time you worry about physical symptoms becoming dangerous you are using catastrophic thinking and fortune telling. You need to work on these distortions. Commit the following to memory: Our bodies are very noisy. Healthy people produce all sorts of physical symptoms that might be uncomfortable, unexpected and unwanted all the time. They are not dangerous! Good luck and I hope you feel better soon."
175970255,There's a music/instrument store right down the street. I had never been in there before today but omg. All the violins. I miss playing mine. I know where I'm going when I save enough to get a new one. All the different instruments were so beautiful
175970256,"Sorry to drop off the face of the Earth. I'm doing better though I believe it'll be a while until I feel I can set commit time to the forum again. It turned out all of my health issues including the plethora I didn't mention on PF were related. Summary: I have been _NAME_ due to circulation/malaise/practically in a coma related issues. Aside from extreme energy loss, I didn't know everything going on at first, and didn't want to confuse with misinformation (not that I'm an expert). Turns out I have a rare genetic mutation that causes an enormous lack of collagen that leads everything to not work the way it should. It's rare, yet at some point in every appointment I get assured me they've dealt with someone ""just this week"" who has it. I'm sure this is totally legit and not trying to seem like they are talking out of their #$%. I'll probably make a post about it when I can commit to foruming again but even the name of the thing...ok seriously, ""Ehler-Danlos syndrome hyper-mobility type"". It took 
me about week to get around it the pronunciation and yeah, it ends in type. Why? Because there are 13 different !$%ing versions. Thankfully it can be shortened to hEDS. Funnily enough the meds I got prescribed before the hEDS dx were ones I should be taking anyway. Seems the lack of collagen covering my nerves sends way too much stimulus to my brain which gives me what I guess can still technically be considered bipolar. My bipolar meds were already originally epilepsy drugs so it worked out. My adhd meds helped because my body basically makes everything other than that type of collagen and adores not transporting any of the essentials through my blood stream. I had been lowering my adhd meds until the worsened circulation issues. This was caused between not having manic high energy anymore plus I don't have great upper body circulation due to dislocations when I lift things...I even found out that my poor posture and neck pain was because I've had dislocated shoulders for exactly since I can remember. Well, 
that's fixed, yet still very frustrating and disturbing. I think the name should be changed to reluctant contortionist syndrome. Joint braces and strength training through pilates have worked along with a supplement called VesselMax. I expect after a lot of physical therapy, I can get blood flow going and I might be able to drop the adhd meds. I've been lowering the dosage again so I'm guessing about 6 months to a year. Also, now due to lots of management my bipolar meds dosage went from 300 to now 25. Amazing what happens when your body gets what it needs. Equally amazing is how everything works better when you don't just eat right and exercise but when you do it to your body's very own special tailored !%#$ing snowflake needs. Anyway thought I'd stop by to let folks know I'm still alive and doing better. Sorry it took so long."

175970259,"I’ve never been diagnosed, but struggle with social anxiety. I need help, but not sure where to start. I’m in my 40’s, am a teacher, single w/2 kids, and am in a struggling relationship now. People have made comments throughout my life that points to me being not very smart, but in reality, I can’t think straight or speak freely around most people. I am a great listener! I am tired of feeling “stupid”. I have low self-esteem, although I have so many accomplishments to be proud of! I cant seem to shake it. Any advice about where to start for help would be great. I talked to a therapist twice, but felt like it was a waste of money. I need more help than paying someone to simply listen to my problems that I can’t even verbalize correctly because most strangers make me nervous!"

175970262,"Yeah. I always thought handling lotsa money was a form of mithridatism. Not even close to ebola, rather ""similar to the situation with influenza"". _NAME_, M.D., lead author of the following: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387 I know someone (my mother) who had the 1968 flu. Other people know someone who died of the Spanish flu. Although Covid-19 is making like The Next Black Death, I don't know anyone who has been diagnosed with it. So, to me, this could well be another instance of The Man doing this (but pulling, rather than inserting): The economic repercussions from the infringements on our freedom are likely to significantly outweigh the effects of the virus itself. To me, this is an exercise in control and surveillance by The Man. Authority figures seeing what they can get away with. How high we'll jump, whether or not we'll push back. As far as I can tell, we're queuing like sheep to the slaughterhouse. The only thing that would convince me that the central banks are not beh
ind this deliberate destruction of small businesses and the crippling of the global economy would be for the world's major banks to waive interest on all loans for at least a year beginning 1 March 2020. That I'd like to see."

As son as we started the honey moon I started to see some changes, he slept alot, low energy, and despite we had a very active sexual life whe we where datting, after the wedding night, the sexual activity started to go low, back home, he was (and still is) unemployed, so stay at home, he helped very little with house chores, and is not intersted in any job, he wants the one job for him. Almost 3 months ago started therapy, but it lasted like 2 months and he is not interested on keep going, I am sure he is schizoid, he does not have any close friends, dont have a close relationship with his parents, is super inteligent but inable to keep a job, he does not feel attachment to the world in general acording to what he said when I told him about SPD, and not interested in going to therapy. I love him, but I did not see all of this when we where dating, and I am not sure I can haddle it, I read a lot here about SPD and I am almost sure he will not 
change. I have a moral situation, because I have this tought tahat I have to support him, I have to be with him, but since the beggining all the relationship start to go bad and I was so tired, emotional exausted, and now, that I know is SPD, is so hard to know what I have to do. I had the hope that he will get help, and I can help him get better. But everthing I had read here makes me think, maybe he will be better without me, he is making a big effort to meet my expectations, and he feels all the time that he is not doing it."

175970278,I went downstairs to pick up the form for my doctor to fill out but she must have forgotten to leave it cause security said they didn't have it. So I'll ask again tomorrow
175970279,"""Self-love defined as ""love of self"" or ""regard for one's own happiness or advantage""[1] has both been conceptualized as a basic human necessity[2] and as a moral flaw, akin to vanity and selfishness[3], synonymous with amour propre, conceit, conceitedness, egotism, et al. However, throughout the centuries self-love has adopted a more positive connotation through pride parades, Self Respect Movement, self-love protests, the Hippie era, the new age feminist movement as well as the increase in mental health awareness that promotes self-love as intrinsic to self-help and support groups working to prevent substance abuse (or self harm - _USER_ID_ by Tweaky..) and suicide."""
175970280,"I'm coming down from the gummy. I have to say, that was very interesting. I didn't take a benzo and I didn't go psychotic. Maybe I'll just be a light weed smoker instead of a heavy one. It doesn't do any harm. Idk if it helped with depression. Maybe a little bit. It helped me connect word and sentence meanings really fast which I found interesting. That's just what I want with depression is different perspective on things, faster.. I'm sick of how slow my life is going. I hate that I don't have friends anymore, again. I feel alone and just want to hang out with people and do things. I want a job where I don't have to interact with customers. Because it's not like I'm going to find a social circle by actually being social."

So we can't tell you whether or not what you are experiencing may be schizophrenia. Perhaps, though, since you have some concerns regarding the diagnosis your current providers are giving you, a second opinion from another mental health professional would be in order? One thing you can do, here on PC, is to take some of the quizzes & tests that are on offer. There's a link to them in the banner at the top of the page. However here's another link as well: Psychological Quizzes and Tests And then here are links to 3 articles, from Psych Central's archives, on the subject of schizophrenia by our host Dr. _NAME_, Psy.D.: Schizophrenia Guide: Symptoms, Treatment & More | Psych Central Top 10 Signs of Schizophrenia | Psych Central Schizophrenia Guide | Psych Central I hope you find PC to be of benefit."

174361846,"Hi, I came on here today because I am feeling very nervous about my mental health. I have delusions on a day to day basis, this is common and I have done very well with learning to ignore/not feed into the voices and delusions in my mind. I am experiencing new delusions again, they are ramping up and I am now noticing myself drifting off into them more willingly, and last night I searched the house for something that the ""voices"" reminded me of. The fact that I am engaging with the delusions and acting based off of those thoughts is was has me most concerned. I suffer with Bipolar type Schizoaffective Disorder. The way I try to interpret my psychotic features of delusion/hallucination is that logically I know they aren't real/possible/etc., however my brain processes them as truth absolutely. I am beginning into the phase of self isolation. At this point in past breaks I have delved much deeper past this point. I have experienced these episodes enough times to know the initial phases that lead to 
extreme delusion. I have what I call ""false memories"". There are memories I have, even entire relationships that my memories do not make sense without the delusions being true. This is what makes it so difficult to not give in to believing these things are real, as my cognitive abilities have always remained sharp to the degree that I can explain very effectively how I see these experiences as illogical, my initial reaction to my first major episode was to go see a psychiatrist. This has been my biggest challenge in diagnosis and grounding myself in reality. My current treatments and tools I use are medications, weekly visit with therapist, and techniques I have learned over the years through experience and sessions with my psychotherapist. I currently take Lamotragine for mood stabilizer, hydroxazine for anxiety, trazadone for insomnia, and olanzapine for psychosis. For the first time ever I have found a solid treatment for my anxiety and mood, and in the past olanzapine has helped me immensely, this time 
however it is not seeming to work as effectively and I becoming more and more distracted. My biggest concern right now is the urge to isolate myself from friends and family. I don't really want to see anyone, talk to anyone. Not even my boyfriend or best friends even though I adore them. It makes me very uncomfortable as I don't have the ability to remain present. My delusions are on track to effect me 24/7. This morning I stayed up until 7 am because I could not stop thinking about them and have been seeing black shadow and also bright light figures and flashes. I am starting to hear/see things in movies, songs, keywords, and signs. If you have any advice for how you or a loved one has managed during a phase of this severity, I would appreciate it a lot. I don't want to undo the progress I have made, almost two years free from irrational behavior. Any advice or feedback is helpful."
175970303,Hope the next two days go by quickly for you _PERSON_
175970304,"I am content being schizoid but find forced interactions & family obligations to be stressful and not at all enjoyable.

175970307,I think getting out and having an in depth conversation with my pdoc really helped me mentally. Because I never get to talk to anyone since I live alone and with covid going on...so I really was happy about that and also I love when my sister calls me and we talk. We should set up another trip to _USER_ID_'s or somewhere else to eat in the next few weeks. It's just good for my mental health.

I am the one who have a problem with this whole situation."
175970316,"No, the reality is that I need Xanax XR 1 mg to function, but my pdoc keeps (unsuccessfully) trying to wean me off of it in various ways. I am to the point where I'm just like ""screw it, put me on Xanax XR 1 mg, for now, I'll deal with it later."" I am so fed up with my pdoc again. I know he's not telepathic, but hey. I mean he should at least know to ask me about whether the Xanax XR controls my symptoms of anxiety well. I know it's about dependence at this point, but I think he should at least ask about whether it controls the really bad anxiety I have. I have really bad anxiety, and pdoc seems to deny that every time. I know it *would be better* if I didn't have to take Xanax XR, but I'm honestly thinking ""why?"" Also, school is making me very anxious as of late and I cannot function in class on the lower dose of Klonopin."
175970317,So I saw SP's island and it's really nice! I have put pretty much no thought into my island since I've just been focused on paying off my last loan. But I'm gonna get some ideas online and do something cool with it

175970321,"Thank u for ur response. Ur analogies were perfect for what I feel. I try hard to forget about the past. I spend too much time trying to think of anything but these losses and traumas. Having borderline personality disorder has made many things much more difficult. It causes physical changes in the brain and the spymtoms are really hard to deal with. It's made the losses and traumas in my life feel more intense than people without bpd. It causes very little impulse control which has led to several attempts to die. I have lacked an identity for as long as I can remember. Always wondering what am I really like . Am I really a good person? I can adjust my personality to fit any other persons, and tho I could get alone with anyone, I get close to nobody. Not for so many years, that as each friend passed away, I'll never fill it with another. I haven't made a new friend in over 20 years. I have had a close relationship with God in my past. Now I feel anger. I know I need to trust Him again but it's not 
something I can make myself do. I feel so empty. Having lost 2 brothers then losing my homes to flooding in 2015 and 2016, and then finding out I have COPD, which led to me having to terminate all the clients it took 20 years to build, I am only able to talk about these things cause it's with no feelings. But the feelings are somewhere and I have to distract myself constantly cause I can't think of any one of these things for more than a few seconds before my mind automatically distracts itself or I dissociate. I'm living w my last living friend and her perverted dad. It's a terrible situation which is much harder being a victim of incest starting when I was 2 till I was 13. By my dad. My reason for living has nothing to do with hope. It has everything to do with my love for my sons. I do not want to leave them by suicide. Every part of me wants to die. I pray I don't wake up on the nights I do sleep. It's not that my sons would not suffer my loss, but suicide would be much harder on them. It's very hard to l
ive so others don't suffer. I believe in what you say about putting my faith in Jesus, I pray still that I will find a way. I just don't know how to. I'm scared to. If I do survive this, maybe I'll see I have some purpose. I want there to be a reason for this terrible pain. If not for my sons, I would not be here."

175970325,"Hello everyone, I'm looking for sone advice on friendship, I do feel emotions, but most of my emotional reactions or expressions are faked or extremely over exaggerated to seem less strange to others. Lately I’ve been unable to keep the mask up for as long as I could before, and people are starting to notice the lack of emotion or reactions when we talk, or how I can’t fake caring about things like I used to be able to. I may have set the bar too high; people seem to see me as kind of strange or eccentric, but normal enough for them not to be disturbed by me, but it’s getting harder and harder to keep up. Around my late teens, people used to describe me as cold, unfeeling, selfish, reclusive, eccentric, odd or off socially, constantly looking angry, etc, so I learned to fake the kind of reactions people were expecting to see, and I got decently good at it. Growing up, I couldn’t make friends even on a surface level because I was so shy and awkward, whereas now I make the shallow kinds of fr
iends easily, then have to break it off before it gets too real, because I don’t want an actual friendship, just to keep the peace and not seem like a complete asshole. I seem to have a high level of cognitive empathy and can read people pretty well, even if I think their emotions are irrational or inconsequential, I understand their reasoning and tell them what they want to hear, but I don’t seem to have any affective empathy at all. Even for something I would care about if it happened to me, I can’t summon the ability to care if it happens to someone else, and other people’s emotions don’t make me feel anything. I try not to hurt people mostly for logical reasons; if someone is innocent and something terrible happens to them, I would be upset because of the lack of justice, but not feel those emotions myself. If someone such as a pedophile was murdered in an overly cruel way, that doesn’t bother me at all, they got what they deserved and emotion doesn’t need to come into it at all. For the sam
e reason, laws don’t have much meaning to me; I follow them if they’re convenient, the punishment is something I don’t want to risk, or they cross one of the few moral lines I have for myself, such as pedophelia, sexual assault, child abuse or unecessary animal cruelty. For a while, I did some research into sociopathy, but I don’t think I’m antisocial enough to go out of my way to hurt someone, mostly I just would rather not interact with them at all. I do have the tendency to use people for my own benefit, more in a Machiavellian way than psychopathic, because there is a certain limit on the damage I’m willing to cause another person to get what I want, but I also don’t feel guilty about smaller things like telling people what they want to hear or playing on their emotions or the reactions and instincts ingrained in most people, if it will help me without them realizing. I only spend time with three people, who I also live with, mostly because of the proximity; my brother, who is the only perso
n I’m truly comfortable around, his girlfriend, who is basically extended family now, and my “best friend”, who I also work with. I have one other person I consider a friend, but after we became close, I started distancing myself, sometimes taking weeks to text him back, and we haven’t seen each other in months. If I don’t see a person on a regular basis, either because of work or us living together, they’re pretty much out of sight, out of mind. When I’m with someone, I’m thinking about them, and when I’m not, I don’t really wonder how they’re doing or miss them very much. I don’t keep up with hardly anyone from my hometown, even relatives, because when I moved away, those people became my past, and the people where I currently live are the present. If I happen to go back to my hometown, maybe we’ll get together, but otherwise, I don’t really feel anything for them anymore. If we’re together, I’ll be in the moment with them, if we’re not, they’re barely even an afterthough
t. I also don’t really text or use social media because I have no need to keep in contact with people when we’re not actually together, in person. In a year or so, I’ll be moving across the country with my brother and his girlfriend, and probably will not keep in touch with anyone from where I live now, except for maybe visiting every few years, because they will be in the past, and whoever I interact with in the new town will be the new present. I’m a very live in the moment type of person, especially in relationships, and usually don’t get bothered if I completely stop seeing someone I used to be close to, sometimes I don’t even notice for months or longer that we’re not talking anymore. It’s starting to feel like I’ve made too many connections in this town, and now people expect things relationship-wise that I really can’t give them. One of my roommates I refer to as my best friend, although I don’t feel close to him and don’t think I’ll miss him that much when I move. Recently, w
e didn’t see each other for four days because of different work schedules, and the next time we had a day off together, he hugged me and said how he’d missed me so much. I feel kind of bad that I honestly hadn’t noticed and had hardly thought about him at all, because he seemed so happy to be hanging out. We have fun together, but I’m pretty indifferent to it; I’d mostly rather be alone, and seeing him doesn’t make me happier than not seeing him. I’ve started avoiding him because I’m constantly hurting his feelings, but I just don’t care about his problems the way I should as a friend or as much as he cares about mine. This morning, he was talking about how lonely he was, how long it’s been since he’s had a girlfriend, and he feels like a loser as the last one in his family to still be single, and I couldn’t think of a single thing to say other than “yeah” and nodding over and over again to make it seem like I was sympathetic. Rationally, I understand what he’s upset about, but i
t doesn’t affect me on a personal level, and it’s completely foreign to anything I’ve ever thought. I’d rather him be happy than not, the same with anyone else, friends, relatives, or strangers, but also I don’t really care either way, if that makes any sense. I’m partially looking forward to moving as a way to cut ties and start over with less of a mask somewhere else; staying in the same town the rest of my life, I wouldn’t be able to keep up the facade or those relationships in a way that would seem normal to most people, and I probably would end up unintentionally hurting them much more than just moving and cutting ties would. The only person who I can genuinely say I enjoy their company as much as being alone is my brother, other than that, if it was a choice, I’d rather be alone. The few girlfriends I’ve had were people who went out of their way to pursue me, and while we did have fun together sometimes, the whole time we were in a relationship, I wished I was single, and once it ended
, I stayed single until someone else came along who was overly invested in being with me. I’m asexual and kind of repulsed by the whole idea, so that’s not a concern. I can’t seem to get invested in anyone, but at least with relatives, we can not see each other for months or years at a time and still be related and have some kind of connection; I have a big extended family and will never run out of people to be around, if I had the desire to. With friends and coworkers and everyone else, most people aren’t content to see each other only once a month or two, and not talk at all in between. I’m mostly just wondering if I should be doing something about this, because it doesn’t really bother me, but I feel like it should. Right now I’m keeping things under control, but worry that it will eventually get to the point that I can’t function in normal society at all. Thanks in advance for the advice."

175970340,"Hi spjm40, Here is what works for me; Exercise any kind. I do stretching exercises. This works for me. I Do small amounts through out the day. I go out side even if it is in the back yard. With your level of stress I would not go by other people to go outside. I go out in the sun even if it is for 15 minutes. We literally were created by the sun so this is like going home. If possible maybe get you sons involved. I put things in perspective. The media is negative in this situation to get people motivated to do something. Unfortunately people are mostly motivated out of fear and death. I don't watch news that much. It mostly talks about the sames things over and over. There are positives stories. I watch comedies and true story movies. Nothing negative. I look at past epidemics to see what really happened. For instance the 1918 Spanish flu killed 50 million world wide, yet only 1% of the deaths occurred in the US. They did social distancing, closed stores, stopped pubic transportation. Essentially a 
lock down. Not to make light of it but the US did an amazing job. I would get a short term medication like Xanax. This will chill you nicely and the family as well. If you are calm they will be calm. Your primary doctor probably would prescribe it over the phone. If you don't have insurance it is not expensive. When this is over and you still have anxiety I would go to a psychiatrist or psychologist or both to find a long term solution. I learned that most people can not handle the anxiety in other people because they have there own anxiety to deal with. So when someone loves somebody who has a lot of anxiety it overwhelms them. They shut down. So the hard truth is you are mostly on your own until your husband comes around. Yes some guys are jerks but most just can't handle it. Doctors, friends and others can fill the gap. I listen to my favorite music of my teenage years. Get your whole family involve. It is just fun to go back and it gets your juices flowing again. Realize that every crisis is a chance to r
einvent yourself. Good always comes out of tragedy. The government learns how to do a better job, people learn how to protect themselves and people learn as always love is the answer. I know you can get through this. I learned taking action is the best medicine even if it is half-assed. When this is over you will have a new better life!"

If they are single, I imagine being their partner and the conversations we might have. But more often than not I am disappointed when I see great actors interviewed. Their lack of articulation, depth, etc..It is never up to the same standard as the clever writers who create the characters they play.

175970360,"That is tough. I think finding a new psychiatrist sounds good. Some years ago I found out that I did better with a female psychiatrist than a male. You can look those up on the search engine of your computer by typing in ""psychiatrist for your home town."" You can go through the list and write down the names and addresses of those which interest you, then go through your list and pick the one you like the best. If you have a women's health center in your town, maybe at a hospital, you could call the director and ask if she can recommend a psychiatrist. Look up local hospitals on the search engine, then go to their websites and see which ones have a women's health center. Write down the phone number then call the ones that have that. I know this is not easy to do when you're sick, which is when you need it the most. I was in that situation and put it off until I had a nervous breakdown. This website recommends CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) in its resources, which is talked about in the area ju
st above the names of people who have written in. It's saying that one's attitude about the illness, or other problem, is very important. I believe that also, and since reading information about that, I try to be positive going into a problem that I can solve it. This puts my mind into looking for ways to solve it, rather than looking for ways to lose to the problem, which is the way I use to look at it in my negative mind state. Big difference. Same brain, just looking for ways to win rather than looking for ways to lose."

175970368,"I often have closed eye visual hallucinations - And what I've learned is that they can be triggered by meditation, lack of food, lack of sleep, some drugs.. Sometimes I close my eyes and I can't hallucinate but when I can, I like to spend a few minutes trying to control them before I decide to fall asleep.. If I think the thoughts, ""car"", I'll see a nice car - But the thought automatically thinks of something else (Which I/you feel that you're in control of - Just like being aware of breathing in and out) and then the visual appears very clear.. This same phenomenon is what can trigger hallucinations of taste of a certain ""thing"" after the mind is stimulated with that same idea of the ""thing"". Alcohol increases dopamine in the reward centre ""Mesolimbic pathway"" - Reward/pleasure centre. Stimulants do this too. Too much dopamine in that area is supposed to be the cause of psychotic symptoms? idk.. But here's my theory.. If there's too much dopamine between neurons in ""reward"" centre, the b
rain produces it's OWN hallucinations based on thought - Because the whole brain is hallucinating in a vat/dark skull right? idk.."

And he’s like 30 min away from here and I never have had but maybe 90 miles til empty or something. And then when I teach him how to do, he wants me to write down literally every detail about how to it on paper, with a pencil just in case it needs to be changed. And then he loses the paper after so many months. And the process starts again.

LSD: Effects and hazards This almost sounds like flashbacks.Because of the way LSD works in the brain and its affect on serotonin levels, you run the risk of Serotonin syndrome. LSD also affects the dopamine receptors{the feel good part of the brain} and Norepinephrine. Anything that screws with your receptors is dangerous. When it comes to serotonin, with LSD it causes the brain to flood you with excess amounts of serotonin which can go beyond the trip. Many people report depression and mood disturbances with chronic LSD use. And it can happen at anytime. You may thing you are ""dosing"" correctly but there is no correct dose. Even if you use the same amount or the same ""dose"" on different occasions, negative affects can happen. There is no way to prevent this."

I remember reading a book in class and the book started shaking and I could barely turn the page.. My voice was shaking and then started going silent lmao... But this movie scene made me laugh so hard about public speaking; YouTube
175970402,"For over 20 years I have suffered badly with panic disorder off and on. And there have been rough patches& this year has been bad. I thought things were back to normal then boom here it go again, I felt bad from the panic and ended back up in Emergency room again Covid19 hasn't help. The losing a coworker hasn't helped, then the tragic plane crash the world felt hasn't helped and I cannot phantom the fear and tears and pain. I've never flown and I just exist in fear and my life has been stolen from me due to fear and I'm sick and tired of it, I was finally living and this year I get hit with this hell again and every waking moment is fear how do I completely conquer this?"

175970410,"Recently I started having a downright weird and absurd thought that I might lose my mind or get to a point where I won’t be able to control my actions and jump from the balcony. I have never been even the least bit suicidal. I love my life, my family, my husband is the best thing ever. I know I had too much anxiety lately and depressive periods but not to a point of thinking of such drastic stuff. So I checked about this weird thought and it seems it is called High Places Phenomenon or HPP. My obsessive thought is only about jumping and not about any other way of harming myself, so it seems weirdly specific. I also read that with obsessive thought your mind attacks her thing which is most dear to oneself. So it basically mean I want to live more than ever?! I would love to hear if anyone else had such an experience."

175970414,"thank you all for your caring and good suggestions so now here is my latest dilema First my sil texts me that my mother in law is unhappy and is acting hateful towards her and she can't take it anymore-can mil come stay with us, They are 800 miles away. We took her in last year this time last year until the new year It was a stressful time for me-I had just learned that the business I worked for 18 years was closing-I did it anyway. My MIL is 96. I love her dearly, she fell once while here and had a mini stroke but we got thru it. My _PERSON_ refused to bring her here for my daughters wedding and sons funeral. Now out of the blue she texts me to give her a break. I told my husband about it and told him that I will gladly take her in but we both have the feeling that it is an open ended break and at her age her health can turn on a dime. My husband is not dealing with our sons death well at all. He always says he doesn't want to wake up in the morning. A year and a half ago I took care of my own mot
her with no help from anyone and even hospice failed me when it was her time to go. They had a dying frenzy going on and since she had me and others were alone I had to administer the morphine and watch her die with no help. I was not a good nurse and she didn't die peacefully- it will haunt me the rest of my life. I told my husband that if she dies here I don't think he can handle it- he bawled and said he cannot. I felt like it was a possibility we needed to discuss. So today her husband texts me and says I want you both to know that your mother is miserable and has expressed it in many ways. She says she goes in her room and shuts the door because she doesn't like my sil. He says we stepped up to the plate 5 years ago and we need a break. Will you please call her and invite her to stay with you awhile? Any thoughts? (Oh by the way 5 years ago they forced her to sell her home and move with them) Neither bothered to say- hey how are you doing coping with the death of our son. I feel awful. My _PERSON_ is a w
onderful person. I love her so much and I feel like she deserves to be happy -these are surely the last years (?) of her life...96. However it's my husband's call and honest to God we are not having a great time of taking care of ourselves right now. He has not given me an answer to give and I am distraught. As much as I feel it would probably be detrimental to my health and well being I would take her in. I don't feel it is my place to force him into something he doesn't feel up to. Am I a terrible person to know my MIL deserves to be happy with us and not move heaven and earth to make it happen despite the affect it may have on us? I mean I can put her ahead of myself and my comfort level but is it fair to make my husband do it? I'm really worried about him as it is. Uggh I do not feel like going to work tomorrow. Mondays are very task intensive and I'm not going to be feeling mentally sharp....."

175970429,I’m so incredibly mad at myself for sleeping the last 1/3 of the day. So mad at myself. Now I’m up in the middle of the night alone.
175970430,Thanks _PERSON_ but my appointment didn’t happen. I stood outside for 40 minutes waiting for my MediCab to arrive and it never did. Apparently there’s a shortage of cabs now and you have to call the morning of your appointment to confirm the ride but I didn’t know I had to do that until just now my care manager told me when I texted her . I’ll have to reschedule tomorrow
175970431,Well dang nvm I don’t have that type of cheese.
174362167,"_AT_MENTION_ how did _PERSON_ appointment go? Is she feeling better? My cat _NAME_ I have had to give pills to before (antibiotics) but sometimes they give me antibiotics that I can give her with a syringe. Neither is exactly easy but the syringe is a bit easier than the pills. She spit out one and I couldn't find it but she took all the rest of them. Now if I had to try to give them to my other cat, _NAME_, I'd probably end up all scratched up. She's never scratched me but she is super independent and doesn't like to be held or anything like that. I'd have to hide it in her food or something! I hope _PERSON_ is feeling better!"
175970432,"Hi _PERSON_, This is a five year old thread, not sure if you noticed this. I also get jerky movements when falling asleep at times. Never thought they were a part of anxiety though. Shows you how little I know about all this. I had a sleep study done a while back and as the moderators know by listening to me I am battling anxiety now for the first time. Actually I have had anxiety I am just now admitting to it and trying to do something about it. My sleep study dr put me on _PERSON_ which helped even out my sleep patterns. I should have recognized all this a year ago as leading to anxiety yet I did not put it all together. Might I ask what others think about trazadone for anxiety? Thanks for any help"
175970433,"Hi _NAME_, My name is _USER_ID_ and I am new to this site as well. I am 54 years old, a disabled nurse and have multiple mental health issues. I am fortunate that I have good health insurance and have attended many therapy programs both inpatient and outpatient. I'm so sorry that y our going through this!!! I have found that people who do not suffer from anxiety and other mental disorders just do not get it!!!!!!! That took me years to accept as my family tells me to just get over it (which made me feel even worse). My husband is very supportive and for that I am grateful. You mentioned your are having anxiety in the classroom...can I ask how old you are? Are you in high school/college? Please don't feel like you have to answer my post or my questions!!! I just want you to know that you are not alone my friend!! I don't believe that not eating will help because if your like me I get hangry pretty easily. I did start eating less junk food and limited my caffine intake and I have noticed a little dif
ference. How are you sleeping??? Insomnia is one of the worse things for people like us. During all my therapies and recommendations from my counselor sleep was up in the top 2 of things I need to focus on. Lastly, I lose motivation often, heck I don't work and have no excuse and that is one of the reasons I joined this site. I don't do social media and I'll save that story for another day...lol I'll just say it makes me feel sad.. Society rates us on our accomplishments, like being the CEO of a corporation or getting degrees in college. I DO NOT buy into any of that!! We are all individuals and are free to make our own choices about what we do in life. I firmly believe that if you ARE TRUE TO YOURSELF, you will find happiness. Shame on society and people who rate success by the size of our wallet or status in like a big company. To be honest, I think they are the saddest people because they are doing what others expect them to do, not what they really want to do. You do not need to figure it all out at one t
ime either, just take it one day at a time. Just take a deep breath, breathe and look in the mirror and say to yourself, I am beautiful and smart inside and out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please, just try it!! Then tomorrow, do it again, and so on and soon you will believe the truth about who you are. I know this because you joined this site and reached out for help. I'm not ashamed of telling my story to anyone who will listen and rather proud to know the truth about dealing with mental illness. You will get through this my friend. I'm praying for you _NAME_:))) God Bless, _USER_ID_"

175970469,"Yeah I think lower to no Xanax and maybe no Zyprexa. Because I was fine on the other stuff alone and I guess my pdoc just listens to me too much, which can sort of be a negative thing in some regards. I am all over the place usually, and him listening to me doesn't really help too much because we end up changing things a lot and then I'm stuck not knowing what to do a lot of the time...

175970490,"Yeah I understand. Must be hard for you moving to your current house. I remember you posted your previous bedroom here on Roll Call. Looked much bigger than now. It really helps to have our own comfortable and peaceful place. Like we want to have people around when we want to interact but at the same time we need our safe place when we feel like being left alone. I hope you’ll move from there eventually. And yeah connection is important. (Just a side story, I have a friend on discord who is severely depressed. He can’t make a connection with people due to his autism. I feel bad for him so I became his friend. But later on I found out that he has this “I’m always right” mindset and he would be passive aggressive towards me when I disagree with him about something, not to mention that he has this habit of making me feel stupid. I told him he needs a therapy because he needs help that I cannot provide. But he refused to go, making 101 excuses about it. He’s an ISFP. So I closed my DM from 
him as he triggers my trauma. But we still talk occasionally in the server with other friends). So yeah connection is important to our mental health. Isolation is against human nature."

174362285,"My psychiatrist is pretty good. She says ""Schizophrenia"" but knew I had atypical autism (PDD-NOS) which I saw written down a few years ago but I didn't think it meant anything. I asked her if I could lower the antipsychotic and she let me try - I realize that I need the antipsychotic even though it can lower IQ - But it lowers it less than psychosis. I'm somehow able to rationalize psychotic delusions and paranoia very well (Maybe because of the PDD-NOS - Giving me some cognitive abilities to realize and make decisions) without antipsychotics but it's still the stress that is painful where I can't seem to focus well. Labels don't really mean much. They're just to aid medication treatment but people with schizophrenia don't have to take medications ""for the rest of their life"" and shouldn't be authorized to take antipsychotic injections by law for the rest of their life either (If you become more mature and trustworthy). There should be an amount of trust between the psychiatrist and patient eve
n though psychosis can get in the way of that. Nothing is for certain. People shouldn't hold onto beliefs for certain. Things change too - Labels change. People need to be more spiritual, awake, aware of their thoughts and feelings and others' thoughts and feelings. Let's make this world happy and for it to keep spinning.

175970530,"So for those of you that do not know I have been on zyprexa for 14 years. Currently doing 5mg. After 7 years of zyprexa I developed drug-induced insomnia and other rather serious side-effects like constant restlessness and brain discomforts, including sometimes pain. Somehow I discovered that certain herbs seemed to help me with a state of phyisical discomfort in my brain and a never ending restlessness. After a while I came to realise after some research that all of these herbs seemed to have one thing in common. They somehow stimulated or worked as a agonist on the gaba-system in the brain. So why not just take a gaba supplement? Well…apparently most(or all) atypical antipsychotics have a antagonist effect on the gaba system. I haven’t researched this extensively, but I think the reason is to reduce the possibilty of developing tardive dyskinea. There is a much greater risk of developing dyskinea when taking first generation antipsychotics, because they don’t have any antagonist action on t
he gaba system. Normal levels of GABA while taking a antipsychotic seems to promote tardive dyskinea. So I took a 750mg dose of pure GABA supplement. And sure enough, on day two or three I think it was I developed uncontrollable movement in my left hand. So naturally I had to stop. I have later re introduced GABA, but now taking only 250mg a day. I have done that for about a week and so far I have not had any trouble with involuntary movements. When it comes to the herbs that modulate the GABA system their effect on me is that they seem to calm down my overactive mind. It is easier to stay calm and focused in the daytime, it takes away discomfort in my brain and I am able to relax in the daytime. For example before I started taking these herbs it was impossible to lie down on a sofa and relax. My mind simply could not rest. Now however this is possible. I can take naps and my quality of life is better. My general health seems to be improved and more normal, combating side-effects from medication. So herbs tha
t can be helpful are: licorice root, _NAME_ bark, chamomille, valerian root and lemon balm to mention a few. Here is a study discussing herbs that works on the gaba-systems anti-insomnia properties which is related to what I’m talking about regarding relaxation. A lot of the herbs they discuss are not common remedies. I never heard of most of them, but there are also a few common ones like licorice root and valerian root in the study.

174362217,"Gang Stalking: Real-Life Harassment or Textbook Paranoia? | Psychology Today What Is Gang Stalking? Reports of “gang stalking"" (a.k.a. ""gang-stalking"" or ""gangstalking"") began emerging at least 15 years ago by self-described “targeted individuals” (“T.I.s”) claiming to be followed, surveilled, harassed, and otherwise victimized by unknown forces wielding high-tech weapons of “mind control.” Since then, much more has been written about this phenomenon, especially over the past few years, with national attention devoted to a few notable cases of violence and mass shootings perpetrated by people identifying as T.I.s.1 These journalistic accounts—in the mainstream press, as well as in self-publication sites like Medium.com and two Vice documentary features (for a chronological bibliography, see the references section at the end of this blogpost)—offer intimate, sympathetic, and compelling portraits of those who identify as victims of gang stalking. By way of summary, T.I.s typica
lly describe living in a state of constant fear, seeing evidence of being followed by unmarked police cars in every black SUV that drives by, of being zapped by “extremely low-frequency” (ELF) radiation or “Voice to Skull” (V2K) technology in every tingling sensation or bodily ache, and of malevolent intentions in other people’s every gesture. Interviews often note that T.I.s don’t appear “unusual,” “disheveled,” or otherwise “crazy” and that some of them are doctors, acclaimed novelists, and other reasonably well-functioning professionals. Indeed, the T.I. community is comprised of thousands of diverse individuals, coming from all walks of life, with similarly diverse accounts of who might be harassing them and why. For example, the “who” is variably attributed to neighbors, ex-boyfriends, employers, police and other law enforcement agencies, “the financial elite,” or less conventional sources, like Freemasons and space aliens. The “why” is often attributed to retaliation 
for ending relationships, acting as whistleblowers at work, political activism, having run-ins with the law, or being privy to secret information. Seemingly motiveless harassment is chalked up to being hapless victims of experimentation by government agencies testing new techniques of surveillance or mind control. If there’s a common thread to the accounts of gang stalking, it’s that T.I.s describe considerable suffering not only as a result of ongoing concerns about being harassed, but also from the experience of physical symptoms, like pain and “hearing voices,” and the significant social _USER_ID_ associated with sharing their claims with family, friends, or mental health professionals who routinely dismiss them as “crazy.” As a result, T.I.s have found solace on the internet, where they share ""war stories"" and survival strategies with like-minded individuals who have similarly found themselves at the center of a vast conspiracy theory. _NAME_/Pixabay Source: _NAME_ The Subjective Reality of 
Paranoia Of course, stalking by a single individual is a dangerous reality for some—especially women fleeing abusive relationships and other targets of erotomania. And bullying by a group of individuals (a.k.a. “mobbing”) is increasingly recognized as a school and workplace hazard. In an episode called ""Trust Fall,"" the NPR Invisibilia podcast recently highlighted a seemingly improbable case of internet harassment that turned out to be real after all. A recent New York Times article detailed another real-life case of ""cyberstalking"" and in-person surveillance by employees at eBay. And yes, a few real events in history, such as the CIA’s MK-Ultra “mind control” program and the FBI’s COINTELPRO surveillance program of the 1950s, have occurred, just as the modern-day mass manipulation of human behavior through social media is a reality in which we all now live. But if you aren’t personally experiencing gang stalking, it’s hard for an outsider, much less a psychiatrist, to accept it as anyth
ing other than a textbook example of paranoia. Indeed, that’s been the conclusion of the few mental health researchers that have examined gang stalking to date. In 2006, Dr. _NAME_ Bell and colleagues published an analysis of 10 online accounts of “mind control experiences” consistent with gang stalking (though they didn’t mention that word explicitly).2 When assessed by three independent psychiatrists, all of the accounts were classified as consistent with the evidence of a psychotic disorder. In 2015, Drs. _NAME_ and _NAME_ conducted an analysis of 128 responses to a survey about stalking that similarly concluded that 100 percent of cases involving gang stalking by multiple coordinated individuals reflected paranoid delusions (in contrast, only 4 percent of those reporting stalking by a single individual were deemed to be delusional).3 In both of these studies, gang stalking claims were attributed to paranoia because they defied credulity, often due to the sheer amount of resources or level of coord
inated organization that would be necessary to carry out what was claimed. As a psychiatrist, it’s nearly impossible to disagree with those conclusions. Delusions are defined in psychiatry as “fixed, false beliefs,” with paranoia representing a classic version in which one believes they’re being followed, harassed, or otherwise persecuted. Vigilance—keeping an eye out for and being generally wary of potential threats—is normal and can transform into exaggerated hypervigilance under various conditions, such as having been an actual victim of violence. At the extreme, full-blown paranoia of delusional intensity can be understood as that same evolutionary warning system gone completely awry, to the point of seeing the evidence and believing that such threats are almost everywhere. And despite stigmatizing stereotypes about psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, those whose paranoia is part of “delusional disorder”—where “non-bizarre” or plausible delusions are the only symptoms—don’t t
ypically appear “bizarre or odd” and have functioning that’s relatively intact, according to traditional diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). (For an excellent portrayal of what it’s like to be married to someone with delusional disorder, listen to this episode of This American Life called “You Can’t Handle The Truth.”) This helps to explain why, aside from their idiosyncratic beliefs, many T.I.s don’t appear obviously psychotic—there is no such thing! But digging deeper tells a different story. Many T.I.s report concerns not only about gang stalking but other common symptoms of mental illness, such as auditory hallucinations or voice-hearing and even less plausible beliefs, such as having “implants” inside their bodies that can control their thoughts or that people have been replaced by aliens. But even those with “pure” paranoia appear to display textbook examples of delusional thinking. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with hun
dreds if not thousands of people with paranoid delusions, including but not limited to those who have claimed to be victims of gang stalking. In such cases, claims of persecution defy credulity on several grounds. First, there’s the unbelievably vast extent of what’s claimed… fleets of black SUVs with tinted windows, persecutors in disguise on every street corner, and futuristic secret technology being deployed from God knows where. Second, there’s a lack of any obvious or credible motive for the persecution… why would the CIA be devoting considerable resources to keep an “average _NAME_” under constant surveillance for years on end (note that paranoia and grandiosity—an exaggerated sense of self-importance—often go hand-in-hand)? Third, the persecutory experiences continue regardless of attempts to escape or relocate, including when hospitalized in the inpatient psychiatry ward, and are contradicted by acquaintances or family and friends living in close proximity. And so, by process of elim
ination as well as recognition as a textbook case, paranoid delusions often offer the best explanation for most gang stalking claims. Of course, it’s the rule rather than the exception that people with delusional disorder avoid being labeled as mentally ill and spurn referrals to psychiatry. But one more thing that can help to clarify that persecutory concerns are delusional is that paranoia often resolves when its underlying causes are actually treated, whether by participating in psychotherapy that challenges cognitive distortions in the face of evidence, taking medications for psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, or stopping the use of illicit drugs well-known to cause paranoia, like methamphetamines, cocaine, and sometimes marijuana or alcohol (many benefit from a combination of these interventions). Once treated, people sometimes develop insight that the experience wasn’t real after all and is best explained by paranoia. But just as often, a delusional belief may not be fully relinquished as an ex
planation for past events, so much as someone is simply relieved and thankful that for whatever reason, the persecution has stopped. Beliefs, whether those of T.I.s or psychiatrists, are ultimately probability judgments where the distinction between a delusion and a normal belief is the difference between what could be true and what's likely to be true and the associated level of conviction for that judgment. By definition, people with delusions hold beliefs with unwarranted levels of conviction, with the main “evidence” for the belief lying almost exclusively within the subjective experience. They often reason that “I can’t be crazy because it seems so real” (if they didn’t, they wouldn’t be delusional—in other words, if you believe you’re paranoid, you’re not!). By way of contrast, clinicians assessing delusions must be open to and investigate the potential reality of seemingly unfounded beliefs (recall that in Dr. _NAME_’s study, 96 percent of individual stalking claims were judged to 
be real), making probabilistic judgments based on objective evidence. By most accounts, gang stalking doesn’t hold up to such objective analysis for anyone other than those experiencing it. That’s the confounding reality of delusions—they’re ultimately grounded in subjective experience, whereas the truth is objective. Serving in the privileged position of authority as an arbiter of what’s credible or not—of the truth—requires that one be open-minded about what’s possible in the universe, aware of the breadth of culturally sanctioned beliefs, and humble about the limits of human knowledge. And so, rather than succumbing to the binary bias, perhaps we should consider whether gang stalking might not be quite so black and white after all. Maybe it’s not as simple as a question of paranoia or not. In Part 2 of this series, ""Gang Stalking: Conspiracy, Delusion, and Shared Belief,"" I’ll examine a third possibility, revisiting the intersection of conspiracy theories and shared delusions in the d
igital age.

175970545,"I have had this exact problem ever since 2015. I see trails behind anything moving (worse in dim/low light), I have also noticed if I look at a light and then look away that the light follows my eye movement. I would say it's gradually got worse over the 5 years.. but not to the extent that I worry what it'll be like in the future. I have been to the opticians several times since the onset of the visual problems, each time they have found absolutely nothing wrong (apart from the issue with tracking moving objects my vision is absolutely perfect - 20/20 according to the opticians). After failing at the opticians, I went to the doctors countless times only to be told that its migraine related (ugh if I had a pound for every time I heard that), after my 4th or 5th visit the doctors referred me to the opthalmology department at my local hospital. They did several extensive exams and the only problem they found was that I had slightly weak eye muscles (they gave me a few eye exercises to do daily and se
nt me on my way) after trying the eye exercises for a few months I went back to the opthalmology department and they did another set of tests and still found no abnormalities with my eyes. I have since given up chasing the eye problem route and have started looking towards a brain problem. After being referred to the neurological department twice and having a full mri done, they found nothing wrong with my brain. The neurologist said its either down to migraines (recommending 500mg fiboflavin and 400mg magnesium daily) or its down to neuron excitability (the only way to sort this is to trial several different medications which have far worse side affects). After 5 years and many visits to different specialists I now feel confident that this must be benign. I find comfort in knowing that I have down everything in my power to try to sort it and there is nothing more I can do. As a few others on the forum have mentioned, trying not to think about it definitely helps, as does a good sleeping pattern and a stress 
free life. I hope this can help someone on this forum. It is absolutely horrible and is very hard to deal with. Feel free to ask me any questions."

He hasn't said a word about me being overweight and he is happy with my weight. I just have trouble with overeating and I'm trying to fix my diet permanently. My problem foods are carbs, nuts, soda, gum, and sugar. How I manage to be anything remotely towards a normal weight seems to be a miracle."

175970569,"But when we fail to decisively choose, it often creates more problems than had we made the ""wrong"" choice in the first place. It is just the wrong way to handle things, I learned. If we make the wrong choice, we just deal with it. Nobody is perfect. Not making these decisions is going to cause you more harm the longer you do it. Trust me, took me a long time to learn this. You need to correct this. The other thing is that most people care overwhelmingly about themselves, not us. People are selfish. The other thing is that I feel that other people's opinion of me is actually none of my business. It is theirs. Hugs."

175970572,I’m actually really glad my dating days are over. So fckn glad. Wasting time on people who either just wanna hook up or don’t wanna commit long term. Plus tons of just men who who don’t want to work or take on adult responsibilities. Etc.

175970574,"Not sure why I deluded myself that I could/should somehow embark on the path of romantic relationships - again. However, this time I have gained some insight and can finally conclude why I should stay alone. 1. Those I feel attracted to, and desire ( which is rare) most likely have a personality disorder, addiction or other emotionally f'ucked up personna. 2. Those who are attracted to and want me, most definitely have a personality disorder. There is a lot of BS out there about how to change/shift the energy or mindset, so one attracts that which is good for them; but truth is, we are hardwired to find this incredibly boring. And so, the options for relationships ( for me ) are boredom + mediocre companionship, or a roller coaster ride into an even more painful and complex world. Being alone is best. Now, the next step is to find the right place in the world to be alone in; where purpose, meaning and all that sh'yte is irrelevant because one is surrounded by such natural beauty that one feels grat
itude, peace and a communion with something other than humans."
175970575,"_AT_MENTION_ by - The melatonin I take comes from a product called 'Midnite'. It has 1.5mg of melatonin. It also contains a blend of lemon balm, chamomile and lavender. I've been taking it at bedtime. Last night was another terrible night. I got two hours of sleep beginning at 4:30 a.m. I'm also experiencing fainting spells now. Just getting up from the couch after a cup of decaf and the news this morning, things got all 'starry', my knees buckled and down I went. My wife was able to catch me before I hit the floor. With this extreme fatigue, inability to concentrate / focus, blurred vision, and now fainting spells, I don't think I should drive anymore. Not until I am able to get some sleep. There's no way I can give these drugs another four to six weeks to start 'working', whatever the hell that is. My doctor better come up with another game plan when I see her on Monday or we're done. _NAME_ - Colorado Springs"

I'm expecting the same for DQB 2. Fire Emblem has a lot of content as well. There are 3 different hard modes, each of which with 3 storylines, so you can technically play the game 9 times and have a completely different experience every time. I really don't like paying full price for games. Rarely do I spend more than $40 on a Switch game. I always wait for sales... except DQB 1 was never on sale for less than $50, so when I saw DQB2 on sale for under $50, I bought it. I will probably buy Animal Crossing full price though, and I already have pokemon shield pre-ordered from Best Buy for a $10 free gift card."

175970592,"For me, unrelieved anxiety leads to depression, so I would say that more human connection than I deem necessary is a bad thing. ""Studies"" say that regular human interaction is necessary for physical as well as mental health, but what about people who are stressed out or otherwise unhappy/uncomfortable by more than a minimum of human interaction? I agree that totally isolating oneself can lead to depression, delusions and other negative consequences, but for schizoids and introverts, where do you draw the line? I try to endear myself to people I see regularly in case I need them for something. If I'm in the right mood, I can even be charming. With clients, it's easy, and it's good for business.

175970597,"Hi everyone. It’s been a while since I posted, I hope everyone is well. I’m having mega anxiety recently. My dr found an increased level (0.2 higher than normal) and ordered a caravan of blood tests. I went today and they took 8, yes 8 vials ????? 5 of them were the normal CBC, blood sugar, vitamin d, etc you get at your annual exam, and three were from a dr I saw when mine was out. I was totally freaked out when she referred me to a hemotologist but he was very nice and explained everything to me. Basically my total blood protein was .2 higher than “normal” so they wanted to cross their t’s and dot their i’s; he said as a hemotologist and oncologist he is very certain it’s an incidental finding as for over 10 years my total blood protein has been on the higher normal end so he’s not concerned. Still of course I’m here freaking out! The what if’s are starting to kick in and I’m driving myself crazy! It was fasting for one of the tests so I hadn’t had any food or drink but wa
ter for over 12 hours and I felt light headed and just weird leaving the office. I know it was a combination of the 8 vials, no food or sugar, and my anxiety in high alert causing me to feel the way I do but I can’t help it right now. I’m 32 and healthy other than being overweight, anxiety and heartburn from the anxiety, but no other medical issues, nor does my family have serious medical issues. I know they are just being thorough but I’m so anxious what the blood work will show. ? anyone else had similar happenings? Thank you for listening ??-M"

175970612,"In South Korea, molka (?? [mo?k?a], an abbreviation for ?? ??? [mo??? k?ame?a]) are miniature cameras secretly and illegally installed in order to capture voyeuristic images and videos. However, the crime of molka refers to images taken with any kind of camera or smartphone. The voyeuristic images and videos are sold online across various platforms, including popular social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr, without knowledge or consent of those on camera. ""Molka"" can refer to both the actual cameras as well as the footage later posted online.[1] South Korea's highly digitized society makes it easy to circulate molka footage and difficult to remove once it has been circulated. The rate of arrests of hidden camera crimes has increased since 2011, hidden camera crimes have become a prominent point of feminist protest and #MeToo in South Korea. Women overwhelmingly make up the majority of victims of hidden camera crimes, while men make up the vast majority of perpetrators. Many[who?] women and cri
tics say that molka crimes and the lack of action taken towards them are a product of distorted gendered violence against women in South Korea and the flaws in the law enforcement system. The problem of filming someone without authorization, such as men using cell phones to film women on stairs and in subways, has been a common form of molka and has even led to requiring all South Korean cell phone manufacturers to have phones emit loud shutter noises upon taking a picture.[2][3] Fixed spycams have been found in public areas in Korea as early as 1997, where secret cameras were found to be installed in the ceiling of a Sinchon department store's women's restroom. While the department store stated that the cameras were installed for ‘security purposes’ to catch pickpockets and people who vandalise toilets, the incident received much public criticism.[4][5] With the increase in smartphone ownership and rapid development of technology, molka crimes have also been increasingly found in spaces such as public ba
throoms, changing rooms, schools, and offices. Molka crimes have been called a product of fast, easy access to Internet technology and ""backwards"" misogyny, or an example of ""digital male sexual violence.""[6] According to police data, around 1,100 to 1,400 molka crimes occurred in 2010[7] and 2011[6] respectively, but in 2018, there were nearly 6,800 cases.[8] Revenge porn, or private photos and footage taken and circulated by former lovers or partners without consent of the filmed subject, is a related form of harassment thought to be roughly as widespread of a problem in South Korea.[9] In 2018, the police stated that 90% of molka crime was committed using a smartphone[10] Public restroom molka crimes Public restrooms are one of the most commonly mentioned locations for spycam installation. Many women have said that they do not feel safe using public restrooms because they feel there is such a high possibility of there being a hidden camera, covering up holes and cracks in walls, toilet paper holders, a
nd hairdryers where cameras might be hidden.[6] In September 2018, the Seoul city government announced it would increase public restroom inspection by assigning 8,000 employees to inspect the city's 20,000+ bathrooms on a daily basis, a step up from the previous 50 employees and monthly inspections.[9] Government inspectors have not actually discovered any recording devices in public restrooms despite checking nearly 200,000 restrooms across the country.[11][12][13] According to police, many spy cameras are only installed for short periods of time—as brief as 15 minutes—and therefore can be difficult to detect even with the implementation of daily searches.[9] Forms of Abuse by Proxy Harassing the victim by using others to stalk her or by charging her with offenses she did not commit. Provoking the victim into aggressive or even antisocial conduct by having others threaten her or her loved ones. Colluding with others to render the victim dependent on the abuser.

175970631,"It seems like they don't like prescribing anything for anxiety anymore. I think because it can be addictive. But not everybody becomes addicted and I wish they would be a little more lenient with people who have bad anxiety. I do breathing exercises that help me and I think I learned the trick. I think when you focus on your breathing you think only of that. I think you have to do that in order for it to work. When you are thinking and focused on your breathing you aren't worrying or feeling anxious about things so it calms you down. Not only that, it slows down the breathing and the heart rate. You may want to learn some breathing exercises. I breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth with pursed lips and I let the exhale last longer than the inhale. Kind of like smelling the roses and blowing out the candles. Maybe this would help you too. It can't hurt to try. This is a difficult time right now and we need all the help we can get.

I've been with the love of my life for almost a decade now and sadly we went from having sex multiple times/week, to once/month. Uggh....I know. There were times we went 2 months without making whoopy. Since starting clonazepam I have wanted it multiple times a week again. My lover's 10 years my junior and has truly been grateful for the change. So, here's my nursing thinking of why it might be this way be FOR ME at least. I'm a Registered nurse in FL.

175970662,"You could try practicing your speech in front of your iPhone and record it if classmates aren’t available. I have anxiety having to speak in front of crowds too. Practice controlled breathing techniques and remember that the other students probably have some anxiety about doing a speech in front of a crowd as well. You are not alone. One thing I’ve learned is that practice makes perfect. If you go over it enough, it will come out in your speech more easily. And when you step up front and center... smile. A nice smile will go a long way. You can even acknowledge that you are anxious standing in front of people, then take a deep breath and go! I’ll say a prayer for you. It will get better. Keep practicing and don’t let anxiety limit you! You limit anxiety. (Remember , you are not alone.)"

175970686,Even my dentist knows thanks to those sheets you’ve gotta fill out and I’m not about to lie.
175970687,"I don't have any more information, other than commenting on your post. I've never heard of 3 people in one psychiatric session. It sounds like a 3 ring circus. I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea in a way, I've just never heard of it. One time my helper wanted to come in to my psychiatric session and my psychiatrist said basically absolutely not. Another time, my cousin as a bipolar was being prescribed a medicine my wife had just read threw bipolars in the depressed state into mania (which is what basically all anti-depressants do if there is no stabilizer like Lithium, which is what I take, to balance the anti-depressant). I called the psychiatrist because he had been my doctor for awhile, and told him what my wife said, and it didn't change his mind. A few days later, my cousin was so hyped up from the new medicine they couldn't even get him in the car, much less into the hospital, for an hour or more. So I think it's can be good that a third party can get data into the psychiatrist, and w
hy not in the same session? I think it should be tried. I think your input could be very important, for people can't always see their own behavior. I would keep taking advantage of that offer. I take 600mg of Lithium and 7.5mg of Mirtazapine anti-depressant and my hands don't tremble. You're doing a yoman's job. The bipolar resources at the top of list of people's names has some good tips and encourages positive thinking. Positive thinking has also helped me get through some tough situations."
175970688,"I suffer from Bipolar Depression and suffer from a lack of motivation. I was wondering if even at all how some of you find the motivation to do anything.

175970689,I see my doctor this afternoon. Not sure what to say. I've been quite lazy lately. I don't see a future. I'm not interested in doing anything because I always get criticized for anything I do. There's always a ****ing problem.
175970690,Thank you. I appreciate that. I feel like I bother too many people. Definitely don’t wanna bother anyone anymore. I’m in so much physical pain right now and my anxiety and stress is so high.

175970697,Thanks. I think I don't really have much pain from surgery anymore. That is cool though. Ya maybe I can ask the person I see about the anti depressant that don't really cause weight gain though. I have some anxiety since she wants me to increase the lexapro I take ya. I have anxiety that I may get some kind of side effect from taking more of it. Do you think increasing the dose of an anti depressant can cause some kind of side effect. Thanks for the advice about diabetes. I need to try to eat foods that will make me not get the diabetes condition. It will be a little hard though I will try ya.

175970702,"Saw my doctor again today. He thinks I’m doing well. I feel well. I’ve had some bumps over the last couple weeks but I’m good. Had some bad intrusive thoughts a few days ago but they went away on their own. So I don’t see him again for a month. He said I seemed more nervous today though. I fidget a lot when I talk to people. I can’t help it. It’s my social anxiety. That and not being able to look people in the eye are my big problems. I mean I love seeing him and chatting with him but I just can’t help it being nervous. He also said I seemed happier. Which is good. I do see a psychologist starting next month to see if we can work on social anxiety. See how that goes. Try it out, at least. I found an old post in a group from about a year ago. I was depressed and starving myself and my doctor ordered me to eat lunch. So I’m better than I was last year which is great. Medication helps me so much, I swear."

Honestly, how am I supposed to properly prepare for said monsters without a care sheet? Can they be at least trained a little bit? I'd like them to mug people and come back with their jewelry to add to my knickknacks. Also, do they do anything interesting aside from eat brains? Why do they feel the need to eat brains anyways?

175970726,"Yes, among others. The comic I linked to in this thread was about that in many ways, seen through three different characters and different ways. I mean it relates, but is not the same. This is not it either: https://www.bbc.com/future/article/2015 ... ppelganger This is more like sleepwalking, probably closer to what this thread was about. What I am saying is closer to the changelings, in that site. https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-l ... les-001825 Not exactly again Not all those stories means the same thing or target the same phenomena, even if they share similarities. Yes, but while there are similarities, it is the said to anathegram. It's different. In my experience, you loose yourself and become the other person. It's like the ultimate empathy. It would be closer to spiritism, when people do this with the dead, except it is not with the dead. if there is outside influence, there is a self, so it is not it. Becoming a crow or whatever is not it either, because you are still a self. Seeing 
copies is not it either, you are still a self. In spiritism, the person loose themselves. There is a movie, unbreakable with _NAME_. He can see through someone else's eyes when he touch them, so he looses his self in that moment. Not the same either, but closer. Ok, one near perfect scene is the scene is Star Wars, when _NAME_ confronts _USER_ID_ in the Dagobah cave. Its the closest I can think of. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdJYpfoqotk But it is also like the others I mentioned. Yes, something like that. Yes, it happens. Sometimes you can see the thread and the borrowing, sometimes not, and sometimes it is just coincidence. The collective unconscious takes out the coincidence factor, and tries to explain it away, which is why it is superstitious in nature. It dates back to Plato and metempsychosis. _PERSON_ simply adapted it in more idealistic and mystical terms. The whole Freudian approach comes from Plato. Some primates are humanists. All humanists are primates. Security was never part of the humanist 
project, in fact it is the opposite of it. Its about taking your chances in order to be free. But it assumes virtuous individuals that can reason and take responsibility and organize and communicate. ""Humans"". The real question is whether it is simply a narcissistic delusion of primates, or a real potential of primates. The jury is still out, but the evidence does not look good. It can open up to democracy, or it can open up to some dictator. I mean eventually it will be the second, but in the meanwhile it could be the former. The end game of humanism is democracy as I defined above. Its not a sure thing, it depends if enough people actually wants it and are capable of it. Can someone own their mistakes? If people keep accepting blame shifting, the project is dead on arrival and is simply a delusion. And I am not even talking about the clowns and the illusionists. Yeah, they are not the same. Primate is the substratum, humanism is their persona. Individualism is their first principle. That's why a keen bear 
can see through a humanist and see the underlying primate. It's what science is all about. The thing is that true humanists don't have sheepdogs or sheperds. Those you are describing are just primates pretending to be humanists, but really they are still working on the feudal level. Ok, quick history lesson of the last 2000 years. With just the thread I am looking at. In every respectable religion and realist philosophy, primates are sheep, metaphorically speaking. They are born sheep and die sheep. Some might take on the role of sheepdogs or shepherds by role, but ultimately they are sheep. Or as Aristotle put it, men as social animals. They are part of a whole, a herd of sheep. Comes Christianity, they say the same, but makes distinctions. First the real shepherd is not a primate, but has no body. He is an ideal, and all the other shepherds are fakes, and some of them mislead and no allegiance to them should be given, but don't kill the dogs, they are sheep too, and even the false prophets are sheep too, to 
the real one. This was in the time of Imperial Rome. Comes the Middle Ages, it becomes feudal. Now the message is essentially the same, but the dogs need to be tolerated, and some primate shepherds are anointed to do the bidding of the real one. They don't have ultimate authority, but take it from somewhere else if legitimate. Still, it is a step towards idolatry that the people that were under Imperial rule would have strongly rejected. The idea is slowly becoming a primate. Humanism was a step further in that direction. Now the idea is a primate, and primates (non specified, are the measure of things). So they reject the idea of the real shepherd and replace it with an idealized self. Its a step forward into idolatry and superstition. This is why I said it was never about security. The medieval age was, but not humanism, and even less the original (which was revolutionary). Now, I did say ""non-specified"", because it is unclear who those primates were, it was left vague for a reason. The idea was to sell i
t as universal, but really it was about the right people, the liberals, that have those characteristic I mentioned, the characteristic of a human, which they get through their liberal education. The liberals become the new shepherds while at the same time claiming legitimacy from being just like everybody else, just better. Or like _PERSON_ said in animal farm, ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."" Those are pigs, and they are the new shepherds. And now, this is where we are. Pigs don't seem human anymore, lost legitimacy, so people become illiberal. So people are searching for men, but can't find them anywhere, because they don't exist. You can be illiberal in two ways, forward or backward. Backward, you are some sort of medievalist, which today seems to be the majority, at least in the United States, not so much in other places. Those are seeking humans that are not pigs, and can't find them, but they look for humans for salvation, just like a medieval person would look for 
the king or God, depending on the subject matter. Forward, it would be democrats with a small d, because the ones with a big D are pigs. Now, I don't know how democrats look like. I see some here and there, but they haven't really stood up. They can't find themselves throughout all the pigs and lost sheep, and there is no secret handshake. So the people you are talking about are lost sheep, delusional for the most part, trying to distinguish pigs from humans (that don't exist) by squinting their eyes. The democrats look like sheep, perhaps wolves in sheep's clothing, at least from a sheep perspective. And that is because the democrat will tell the sheep to stop squinting at pigs, and instead take to the field, but that is where wolves are, thus the problem. So you see where the security is. It is backward, not forward. Now, of course, there are true wolves as well, in sheep's clothing, and it is hard to tell which one is which. Explained. Yes, nobody knows yet either, and maybe it is impossible. Democracy is 
about diversity of ideas. So there are just as many solutions as there are people, almost. It is why it gets paralyzed by inaction in the long run, but people aren't there yet, because it is based on the virtue of tolerance, which people simply don't have. In fact it is the only virtue, along with some courage that is allowed. There is simply no answer to those questions, because they cannot exist. One day it might be one thing, and the next another. In the end, people are on their own, which is the ultimate fulfillment of the individualist first principle. It's inevitable."

175970729,"I am going through something very similar today. I for some reason am filled with gas. So I am not sure if it is the anxiety causing gas or the other way around and yes also IBS, been back and forth in a panic. I ended up walking on my treadmill and that helped some. What really helped me was 1. Laying on my left side and I burped because the food transitions in that position quickly 2. I made a fist with both hands and pushed into my belly back and forth, kind of like when someone is chocked, but much more mildly and that pushed out so much air and I burped and burped. I still have gas below though. I am feeling an awful lot better now writing this but right int he middle of my chest I feel hollowness, perhaps skipping a heart beat in panic. I just want to know I completely feel you. I did check my blood pressure, my heart rate and everything was normal. So I knew it was the panic attack setting in. I just took a Clonezapam and hoping I'd feel better."

My brother is trying to pull me down again by telling me how bad the economy is in my country meaning there is not much of a future here. He is such an ***. Well, the economy is bad everywhere now. Duh! I know I am lucky and blessed to have a job. He is so negative and mean. I don't know how he lives with himself. All he does is talk badly about others. Unfortunately, he is not doing well himself. I realize I can't let him pull me down as he has in the past. I really can't stand the sight of him. My mother overprotected him,. He stays at home and does not pay rent. My mother says she can't kick him out without him having a decent job. Whatever!! He will never have a job or any job!! He keeps making fun of my illness and says he is not ill like me. Well, if you are not ill, then why aren't you working? He helps my father he says with the b
usiness but he does more harm than good. I wish I had a more loving family. But, he is the bane to my existence. Having a brother who wants the worst for me is really sad to accept but this is my reality. I hate to say this, but I hope he just disappears from my life for good. Nothing good has come from him. What a sad statement! I do think my parents did something wrong with raising him but he is an adult now. He has to realize this. But, my parents enable him so there is no hope for him. On a lighter note, I feel ok so life is not bad. I will survive and do my best!"

My therapist encourages me to try evidence-based medications, if I am going to medicate -- rather than unproven remedies such as various teas or CBD, etc. But at this point I really need some relief, so I am going to try a few different things, even if there is not compelling scientific evidence, from RCTs, to support its efficacy."
175970753,"Yeah that's probably true, but they got it from us. Yep. We did it wrong."

175970757,I don’t know how this guy is diagnosing ASPD but torturing and killing people is “violating social norms” “violating others rights”. If you do it more than once it shows lack or remorse and you would have to have a lack of empathy to do it to begin with. That is more than enough for a diagnosis of ASPD by any standard

We are cheering you on! S.C."
175970786,Is it visible now?
175970787,"Not doing so great today. I guess I got myself into a bit of a situation at school. Apparently I wasn't supposed to talk to the head of the uni. I guess I screwed up. Now someone in my department is pissed apparently. Though I did realize, I was doing a LOT better earlier this year. It could have been when I switched therapists when I started to slide. I think that's true. Because the therapist from before was a lot better. I don't know why I switched, quite honestly. I kind of wish I could be back with my therapist who I was seeing earlier in the year. She's just a better therapist overall."
175970788,"Just to flip this onto its head for a minute: what if the schizoid reaction is the correct one? Looking at the way we live compared to how we used to live, we see a significant detraction from normal behaviour. For many, life is a conveyor belt of normality. You, like everyone else, are brought up to go to school from 4/5 to 16/18, then to develop a career, working for someone else. The main goal is to buy a brick building in which to live, and then spend the rest of your time trying to buy back as much time as you can so that you can do what you want. The main goal is to make sure that when you're too old and weak you'll be able to do stuff that you wished you could do when you were younger. That, when you look at it, doesn't really make a lot of sense. It presupposes that everyone is the same; that everyone has the same goals, fears and drivers. Given the unique characteristics of people, doesn't it seem obvious that, psychologically, people will ""act out"" to try to re-establish their own versi
on of reality that matches their own goals, fears and drivers? Certainly, most of the people we look up to as inspiring thought leaders are people who are ""weird."" They have odd visions of life which, as odd as they seem, resonate with groups of people. People who feel stressed react in ways that aren't always obvious. They can cut themselves, develop obsessive behaviour, eating disorders and create fantasy worlds in which to live. Most of these are seen as coping mechanisms, and a good psychologist will dig into the cause to find why these behaviours are necessary. If it's caused by abuse or some other series of events, these can be explored to help the individual create a new story for their life, hopefully to end the damaging behaviour. But what if the stress is caused by ""normal"" life? There is no fix, because you can't change the world, but it doesn't make the ""normal"" we have right. And, if the way we live now isn't right, it means that the schizoid reaction to that doesn't need to be fixed, becau
se it's a reasonable response to psychological imprisonment. Some time ago I read an article about a person who was kept in isolation as a prisoner for years. He spent most of the timed in a small box room, with no window onto the outside world. He coped by creating vivid mental images. He created his street in his head and his neighbours were different parts of the walls. He'd visit them, talk to them and create a complex story for their lives that he could interact with. To all intents and purposes he was schizoid, but he wasn't diagnosed schizoid, as it was clear that it was necessary for his mental health. Maybe the only problem with schizoid people is that they don't fit the modern day world-template. It begs the question: why aren't there more schizoid people? Maybe there are, but many of them fail to create the internal world and, instead, end up depressed or self-harming. The more complex the world becomes, the more defined normal becomes and ""surprise surprise"" more people are psychologically malad
aptive."
175970789,"My activities at this point are nothing. I try to force myself to work on small projects that used to excite me but now it is a major struggle. Maybe 1 day out of 10 I can force myself to work on them and start to feel a little better but even that is takes lots of effort. As far as my psychiatrist, she recently moved to Colorado and I haven't looked for another. I have been getting my Effexor from my general practitioner."
175970790,That does sound very stressful _AT_MENTION_
175970791,"My old psychiatrist told me that quitting smoking helps to stop decreasing the antipsychotics in my blood. ""_PERSON_ notes that tobacco smoke may inhibit the effect of commonly used drugs like haloperidol, and the inhibition “can be as high as an increase clearance of 40–98 percent for olanzapine, a costly medication.” Is it just tobacco smoke or also nicotine gum? Because I've been chewing way more nicotine gum on olanzepine."

He spent days cooking pies, cakes, cookies. Basically our favorite desserts. He also made dishes that we see in fancy restaurants. With the table set up in festive decorations for the holiday. He also made sure all of us had enough food to take to each of our homes to eat a few days later. Our gift to him was cleaning up the kitchen because he wasn't the type of cook that cleans up while he was cooking. That was a nice gift throughout the years. Does anyone else have any meaningful holiday gift they would like to share?"

175970813,"I had the same confusion as Cashless. In any event, my suggestion would be for your husband to see a psychiatrist, be completely honest with the psychiatrist about how much Xanax he is taking, and explore with the psychiatrist the various alternatives. Cold turkey is probably NOT a viable alternative. But a slow, closely-supervised weaning off of the Xanax, while taking an alternative medication, could work well. In terms of what the alternative would be, there are a variety of options, including other benzos that have a longer half-life, or various other medications that may not give the same sort of ""immediate relief"" but are less addictive. But this is serious business and it really requires more expertise than you will find on this (or pretty much any) internet board. I wish you and your husband the best."

175970836,"Hi _NAME_ I would consider talking to your current doctor about how Klonopin does not seem to work for you. Tell him/her pretty much what you wrote in your opening post. Often doctors just need to show that they are following the 'rules', by switching current Xanax script s to the longer lasting Klonopin. But if the patient does not respond well to Klonopin, Xanax could perhaps be script _NAME_. Also it's possible that your doctor would be more open to script ing Xanax if you only require 10 pills a month. It's worth a follow-up visit. Maybe there is another benzo besides Xanax that would work better for you than Klonopin. If your doctor still seems hesitant to script you with a fast acting benzo, maybe ask him if he would prefer you see a Psychiatrist for your anxiety meds. Good luck!"

175970843,Someone at moms work got the COVID diagnosis and will be home at least until Monday. I know this is a dangerous and not a joke but it still bothers me that physical illness is the only side of health that my family is only concerned about. They won’t let me speak about my mental health and hearing them be concerned for something that they don’t even have yet sounds so petty to me. It actually made my symptoms worse or I made my symptoms worse because I know that my health is of no concern.

175970850,"My dream was of hot air balloons that were flying over the sky. I was witnessing things and wasn't really apart of the dreams - Just watching clips of nonsense. I hid stimulant powder on pancakes and put them in the fridge so my mom wouldn't notice. 4 men dressed up in drag along with hundreds of women who infiltrated the house. These men in drags were beside my pancakes and started shooting missals at an airliner plane which went down - But they kept shooting missals so it was clear that it didn't look like aliens shot the plane down like they wanted to think. The cops showed up to the house. Eventually the men in drags were being hanged in the middle east and the last guy I saw got a golden plate put on his head for electrocution and he pretended he had a seizure before he was electrocuted. As I was watching these people being executed in my dream, I thought, ""Would I rather be tortured? - I want to be tortured in a form of masochism to get back at them""."
175970851,"Don't be sorry. Sports have their place, just to my thinking sports should not be number 1. I'm old and when I was in school music was mandatory, everyone learned an instrument. Now those same schools no longer do that and only the kids who's parents can afford it get music. I'm legally deaf have been since I was 3 but I had to learn to play and learn to read music I totally believe it enhanced my life. I'm sad that now the arts are so restricted. On the other hand my high school now serves 34 native other languages kids in my day there was only English and three foreign languages to choose from as a second or thrird language."

175970861,"The mental and physical effects of Adderall Abuse have taken a toll on me for years now. I’m 20 years old and should be in college in Chicago but I’ve been staying with my parents. I’ve struggled with Adderall for 4 years now and I wish I never took it. I have extremely high addiction tendencies and I hate myself for it. I’m underweight, having chest pain, and lacking the motivation to do anything for myself and my own health. I’m just asking for someone who has a similar situation please reach out to me. I need advice because I clearly have failed myself for 4 years now and have nowhere else to turn. COVID is making it worse but it has always been a regret and embarrassment for myself ever since I started. I appreciate any responses. Thank you so much."

175970864,"The nature of depression is it's dark, world view, coupled with genuine fear and self-doubt. Unfortunately, these feelings can turn outward at the closest person, in this case, you. You're as isolated as your partner, and you need outlets away from him. Perhaps through work or other interests you can make some friends who get you out of the house. I agree wholeheartedly with the prior writer who suggests offering compassion and love, without judgement or counsel. He has to take steps on his own as he is ready. Maybe you can watch the Great Depress on Netflix together. Have a positive shared experience and a few laughs. Take it easy. Good luck."

175970868,"You really have to like JRPGs and turn based strategy games in order to enjoy it. If you liked the wild area in Pokemon Sword/Shield, where it's an open area to explore and you can see pokemon roaming around in the grass, then you might like this game. It's definitely more of an adventure than pokemon, I'd say. Pokemon is pretty simple. It's basically ""follow the route from your mom's house and defeat trainers/pokemon until you reach the elite 4,"" but the entire dragon quest game is more like, ""here are 50+ wild areas like in Pokemon shield... go explore them, defeat wild monsters, find loot, explore dungeons, do quests, visit cities/towns, buy/sell/forge equipment, level up, and defeat all the bosses."" But yes, there are cartoony looking monsters like pokemon. You fight monsters as well as people. So it's kinda like an ""open world"" pokemon, except instead of using monsters to fight other monsters, you recruit people to fight the monsters. You also don't ""catch"" the monsters. (There are Dra
gon Warrior Monsters games which are a spinoff that's a lot like pokemon, but that's different.)"

If not, implementing self care and finding out what kind of stress you can remove from your life can be a place to start too. You’re not alone."

175970900,"Initially the beauty of this place broke through my anhedonic state of being. Mountains and sea...who could ask for more? Granted there is every breed of tourist thrown in, but I thought there was enough craziness to keep me interested. Sadly the usual apathy has set in. It took 6 days; longer than usual, admittedly. I don't sunbathe; am not a shopaholic or indeed an alcoholic, and therefore feel more estranged, lonely and disconnected being among such people than if I was alone. It is tempting to score weed, if a little risky considering I know no one. And also, truthfully it may heighten my lack of connection with people; my lack of joie de vivre once it wears off. Considering I am holidaying with my mother...probably not a good idea all round. I guess I'll focus on making it as good as possible for her! Be a little altruistic considering she has less time left on this planet than I. Or maybe I'll hit lucky and die first"
175970901,"You are definitely not alone and not the only person feeling this way. I know its hard that people in your life don't seem to understand and expect you to get over it as if were that simple.. Its insulting when people think you wake up everyday wanting to feel sad. Trust me if it were that easy I would gladly like to ""get over it"" just like that but if you are in the same boat as me then you know thats not how it works. As I am typing I am literally sitting here crying and I have no clue why. I am just sad and my anxiety doesnt make it any better. I thought I was better too yet here I am again, trapped in the same black hole of emotions that I cant even understand myself. I am new to this online community but so far I am finding a bit of peace knowing that there are other people out there who understand what I feel and that I am not the only one. If you dont have the energy to do the things on your list, try picking one and MAKE yourself do it. Kinda like a bandaid, just do it one at a time to ge
t that motivation ball rolling. Dont overwhelm yourself with too many things. Personally I love making lists but I do overwhelm myself when I give myself too many things to do. Of course I want to keep busy but if I find my list to be too long it ends up bringing my motivation even lower. I really hope you feel better and dont ever think that you are alone, I hope my tiny piece of advice about starting your list helps. :)"

I even worry now and again about the future fate of a possible pet when I am old and may die first. I feel I would have to arrange we die together. Soppy I know, but I have always felt closer to animals than humans. Part of my ''existential depression'' is to wonder if I will ever reunite with them after death.

Also, I'm simply going through the motion while replying to 1PolarBear, who was pretty intense too in his negative reaction over my quoting of this reputed forensic psychiatrist. I've been nice to you and everyone else, so what demon has taken over you since we last spoke? Why do you say I'm trying to fake a schizoid disorder? I've never even said I was diagnosed with SPD or anything else (_USER_ID_: I mentioned insomnia actually), which is kind of the opposite of what a faker would do right?

I haven’t talked to my bestie for a week and I miss her, but I need to learn how to validate myself instead of getting a validation from others.

175970945,"Hi _NAME_, I have been in those situations before. Few things will help you. 1) Can you start making your bed, first thing in the morning? It will help you to feel good about yourself. 2) Can you say thanks to God for making you breathe? 3) Can you talk to your parents and say something which will bring a smile on their face. 4) Can you look at one picture from your past which you are proud of or happy about? You are mentioning the things that happened by which you are unhappy, but the real deal here is your self-image. When you put time there, these things look very small. Wish you all the best. You haven't seen much yet, there will be wonderful people waiting to come into your life."

The first day on lexapro I would say was a little more difficult but overall I have had a smooth start up Now ever since I started lexapro 3 days ago I actually felt some immediate relief. Every morning I still wake up with a bit of anxiety but not like before I started the pill, and still sort of in a brain fog. But towards the afternoon I feel a little more like myself, nausea is down so I’ll force myself to eat. I’m happy that I feel as if this working for me already but is this normal? P.s. This is not my first time using lex and I’m on 5mg."

174362830,"I got mostly good reviews but my 6am student complained about me. All we did was do introductions and she complained I talk too fast, etc. So, I have to be careful. My other evaluations were positive. I had a meeting with the manager. He said , yeah, we are happy to have you on the team but we have to accommodate our customers. It is the last time I am thinking introductions are not going to count against me. I had not even taught her yet. The student is an *****. I have to teach her still. She is a living nightmare. I say duh duh and she thinks it is a word. I can't believe she is that dumb. But, she is. Oh well, I can't win them all. I am not going to worry too much about it. I was going to tell my family but they have their own problems. So, I am just venting here. I don't think I am that bad as an employee. But, she made it sound like I was rude and uncaring. I was just doing an introduction to myself. What are you expecting? I hold your hand and we say this is A for apple B for boy. Some of th
ese customers were taught English in school. The biggest phrase they can say is my name is duh duh. It is a shame but, I guess, this is why I have a job. What a living nightmare. I am being expected to teach her to speak conversational English. Please wish me luck!! I need it. She complains then can't even say a decent sentence. Oh well, honey!! I will be ok. She just gets on my nerves. I was trying to be friendly but must have come off as aloof? whatever, the culture here is mind boggling. I hope I don't get another customer like her again!! I had to teach other students while dealing with the manager about addressing her complaints. It was stressful but I pulled it off somehow. I hope this does not occur again!! Sometimes, things happen for a reason. But, she did not even give me a chance to show my skills as a teacher. She just went to the management and complained about me. Whatever!!I am doing well otherwise until I meet her again on Monday. Good grief!! Well, it is just a job. I will be objective and ju
st think this way."

175970989,"Hi Cln77. I know what you mean about these disturbing thoughts coming in your head. I get them on occasion. The best thing you can do is breathe, in through the nose and out through the mouth with pursed lips. It slows everything down, even your thinking gets under control. And like _NAME_ said, try to think positive thoughts. Don't give in to the urges of harming yourself. And if you have a therapist I would discuss this with him or her. You can get control over your thoughts. And disregard the urges,. Keep hanging in there and post when you need. I would talk to a therapist and try to nip this in the bud. Best wishes, _PERSON_, _NAME_..."

I have pretty severe depression so part of me is just resigned to the idea of dying, the other part is like ""wow, I might actually be in terminal trouble"". Oh and I have another sinus infection. So that's cool. Any words of encouragement or whatever are appreciated. Idk if multiple swollen lymph nodes are a death sentence or what. But I'm pretty bummed.

175971003,"Hello, it's such a big step to reach out. I actually just joined Inspire, can totally relate to how you're feeling. I had major depression, anxiety and the 9 yards a few years ago. With prescribed meds, counseling etc. I fought it, now it's back and worse than ever. And I don't really know what to do either, especially with covid going on. I do have a list of things to do to cope, lmk if you want me to attach it. Best of luck getting through this, and just know that you deserve to feel validated, and if you need help from professionals, the crisis line is completely free, and there for you 24/7. I use it almost every day. Text 'hey' 'hi' 'hello' or anything to 741741, and they'll connect you to a professional to help you via text. You don't deserve to feel alone in this, it's as real as cancer or a broken arm. I know how alone it can feel when others don't understand - typically only those that have gone through it truly understand what it's like. I have always wished that the public would see depr
ession as real as it actually is, and not think its 'just sadness'. We're here for you, you're not alone, stay strong and keep fighting this battle! You don't deserve to lose this battle, you're much too valuable for that, and even if it feels like noone cares, I know for a fact your wife would be heartbroken if anything happened to you. Likely she doesn't know exactly how to show you how much she truly does care for you, which is more than you'd ever realize."
175971004,"theHTreturns: Thanks for the super-kind words...your support means a lot to me... getting by: Yeah my wife isn't so keen on the meds...will explain later...thanks for the super-kind words too...hope you have had nice walks with your dog so far...they are Man's best friend! UPDATE: My Bipolar wife is still the same...she laughs a little less nowadays, but still laughs.. At the beginning of the month, I noticed that she was rather shrewd...her hand would go into the medicine bottle and she would pretend to swallow something, but nothing went in...I think this went on for a week until I happened to notice by chance one night...so after that, I made sure that I saw to it (with my very own eyes) that she actually took the medicine and swallowed it...Once, she spat out the pill silently into the cup, hoping I wouldn't notice... It's been very difficult...she won't even think of taking the medicine until I remind her...that means if I don't tell her to take, she most likely would never ever do it...which 
is scary, if you think about it... Her behaviour has become rather strange too...sometimes, she will be walking, and suddenly stop and freeze like a stone...if I call her name, she won't respond...then after about a minute or two, suddenly she will twitch and then respond again...Also sometimes when she freezes, her mouth will open wide...it's as if someone is controlling her or something. Sometimes, she will talk to herself...or talk to someone who isn't there... There are other times when I call her name or ask her something and she doesn't reply at all...and then about 20-30 seconds later, she will reply me... She's still very much on the _PERSON_ midnight/1am/2am/3am fast-food binge... In spite of all this, she managed to get her old job back and some new tuition assignments...I honestly don't know how she manages to fool people...or maybe they pity her or something...or maybe she's a terrific actress with them... She doesn't seem to want to be near me...when I enter the workroom, she will leave soon afte
r...when I enter the bedroom, she will leave soon after... After eating together, she will just smile and say 'bye' as if I'm a friend...I have to wash and clear up everything and every week, I do our laundry on my own now... Tonight, I was very saddened by her words. During dinner, she asked me how I felt about our marriage and where I thought it was heading...I started to feel the first flutterings of panic because this was very much similar to the time before she dumped and divorced me the first time...she said what's the point of hanging on...I reminded her sternly that I love her and I'm the guy who visited her at IMH and got her out and married her and loved her...she kept quiet...she said she seldom saw me anymore...I said I was away at work...it's as if she was coming up with excuse(s) to leave me... When I went upstairs, I cried...silently. Messaged some close friends+sister+close cousins for support...they were all very supportive and lent a listening ear...some offered prayers...some offered advice
...I'm just glad there're still people there for me... I'm trying to remain strong...but...it's very tough. I have this gnawing feeling in me that it will end badly again...because I think she's no match for this Bipolar/whatever illness she might have...it's clear she's losing the battle, which entails that I will lose too... I sometimes check my wife's phone...she's still messaging this one guy, but he has not replied in ages..thank God...I think he realised quite early on that my wife's in her unstable/crazed state... Today, I asked God why I had to go through all this...was He punishing me for something...? I told God I'm not sure how much I can take anymore...I love my wife, but because of my strong wording tonight, she took offence and I've become the enemy again overnight...I'm only human, I can't always smile and pretend to be nice all the time...sometimes, she has to hear the hard truth but she takes it the wrong way... : / Still, I've been keeping afloat buying some things I like...one toy collector 
was migrating to Taiwan for good, so I went to his place and bought a lot of his vintage 80s Transformers for half of market price...also bought quite a few old comics recently at a steal...and have been selling some as well...some fun at the side...decent fun. I think other guys would have gone to find another girl etc to have an affair...I'm not that type of guy at all, so I will just keep doing my toys/comics thing, hoping that one day, my loving, kind wife will return to me... : _ _ ( Feel like crying now, but too tired to cry...wife's sleeping next door now...she will wake up at 5/6am...then leave the house at 10/11am...and won't return home till night...and this gives her the excuse that she doesn't see me at all...we used to wake up at the same time...used to have the same off-day...all ruined by the Bipolar...it's not her fault too...she didn't ask to have this illness also... I'm just surviving day to day...I don't know how I even do it...but still, I press on. I think without the love of God, I woul

175971010,I'm sorry.. How long do your panic attacks usually last? Maybe the SSRI isn't working unless it hasn't been long enough... Try making tea or warm milk. Listen to a guided meditation. I'm gonna focus on mindfulness and spirituality right now that I'm focused. Good thing for you is that you're religious so you could spend some time doing healthy rituals or reading about it - Cuz the info is so deep. Maybe call someone close to you and have a talk. I remember I was having a massive dissociative panic attack and I talked to my dad - He talked to me and made me laugh while the Ativan kicked in. Humour and funny things are like the opposite of panic imo. If you need anyone to talk to just keep posting here no matter how weird it is and we can respond without judgement ^^

175971018,"I’m sorry you’re still hurting That pisses me off. Like my father in law. He had that colonoscopy that blew up his insides and was in a coma for months. After the coma, multiple (more than 15) surgeries, and in 8 months in ICU, step down, then rehab he suffered from some sort of nerve disorder in his legs. He had drop foot bad and it improved with PT but the pain in his feet and legs was unbearable and constant. He was prescribed Percs every 4 hours for 3 years. He liked to socialize so only took them at night - 2 at 11 every night. Well after 3 years they decided he was going to be an addict so they pulled him off cold turkey and gave him gabapentin . He was okay for about a year because he had the leftovers from the prior scripts he hadn’t taken but the last 8 months of that man’s life were HELL. GABA may as well be a sugar pill. The man could barely walk. Like would it have even mattered if he were addicted? He was dying either way ya know? That’s the only thing I can say about cancer 
docs. At least they get it. When my mom died she was on a fentanyl patch, liquid morphine once an hour, and OxyContin when she could swallow. No means of comfort were off limits. Tequila, pot, pharmaceuticals, cupping and all that stuff. Whatever gets you through."

I can’t stop thinking about my family every day and it’s excruciating and it’s killing me. Especially the loss of contact with my kids. I missed my daughter’s last 2 birthdays including her sweet 16, her getting a drivers license and she has a boyfriend now. She hasn’t talked to me in almost 2 years. My other 2 kids are fading away gradually even while I’m working my butt off to be there for them love them and meet their needs and have fun with them.

Essentially, Judge _PERSON_ is saying: ""You gotta fight. For your right. To P-A-R-T-Y"" ~ It's time for some civil disobedience. ~"
175971071,"Most of them didn't know anyone who had caught it. Most still don't, by far. Even though the virus seems to have the potential to easily infect most people on earth in a matter of months if left unchecked, the percentage of people infected anywhere in the world so far is still tiny. And that's already a calamity in some places anyway. The fatality rate seems to be one of the most consistently misunderstood things about this outbreak. For one thing, we only have rough estimates (wildly variable even between places in very similar situations), because we don't have the data that we need to know the actual numbers. I guess that much is part of the public consciousness. But the point most people seem to miss (which is really the whole point of all the drastic measures being taken) is that even if we knew the real numbers, that ratio wouldn't predict what will happen, it would only inform our best guesses and what we could do to improve the odds (like, say, by social distancing, in the absence of a bett
er option). Because the fatality rate is not an attribute of the disease, it's an attribute of the epidemic. You can be sure that the fatality rate will be ridiculously higher in, say, North Korea than almost anywhere else. Because the place (the culture, the shape of social networks, the geography, the structure of government and public agencies, etc -- and most importantly, the resources available and the level of effective coordination in place to use those resources) and the circumstances of the spread matter more than the disease on its own. Snowflakes aren't the problem, the snowball is. Maybe they're making a mistake. Or maybe they have the right resources and circumstances to pull it off (hospital beds/equipment, well-established/far-reaching social services, inter-agency coordination and so on, stuff like that). Either way, there's an abundance of concrete evidence (like, piles of coffins, or even dead bodies waiting for coffins -- there are places where people are having to leave their dead by the f
ront door like trash) that what Sweden is doing doesn't work for most other places, even if it may work for them. The same way that what China did, the way they did it, on such a massive scale, just can't be done elsewhere. Because the Chinese government, um, ""has the structure to promptly control the flow of people as necessary to contain large-scale situations"", we could put it that way."

174363028,"Thank you for your reply. I used to take antidepressants like Prozac or Celexa and Lexapro. All at different times. They used to work untill I had my first real bi polar episode 10 years ago. thinking it was just depression the antidepressants gave bad side effects that I never had before and made my mood fluctuate rapidly from an almost euphoric high to a crushing low as well as insomnia. I was then put on Lamictal alone a mood stabilizer that did nothing but give me bad headaches and made gain 30 pounds. After that I gave up on meds. did therapy alone and was somewhat better for a few years until recently. I have now started on meds again and am facing my fear of them. Trintellix is supposed to be a milder form of ssri and I suppose the abilify is supposed to keep the antidepressant alone from destabilizing me. To my knowledge I was the first in my family to have this.My kids have have both suffered with anxiety and depression and have been medicated for both. I guess I passed it down to them. Ma
ybe my absent alcoholic father but can't say for sure because of the alcohol. I am a positive thinker with a lifetime of therapy, self help and my christian faith.

I don't get up early usually but I did today so I could go mountain biking through the trails. I don't have much to worry about because my disability check is 1700 dollars a month. I feel like I take not working for granted but I know that I have to improve myself because I feel bad in a way where other people are working. I never felt bad for not wanting to work when I had anhedonia. I wasn't on disability yet and just quit cuz I wanted to slit my neck in the washroom and my coworkers were assholes. One kept making fun of me because I never smiled. I didn't know why I didn't smile. Then when I was working in retail, a coworker grilled me because he said that I wasn't showing enthusiasm for the job. He HAS to work because he has kids and was like my age. Like it's not my fault that I'm not happy working because I have to take care of only my suic
idal self. I feel bad now when I don't go to work and someone else has to cover my shift. That's why I don't want that responsibility. I want to work in my own time like how I'm not a machine and would rather live with a tribe in the jungle. If I was born in the amazon, I'd say my positive symptoms would make me a healer and I'd do ayahuasca. I see no difference in how schizophrenia is treated in the west compared to the east. All we do in the west is prescribe drugs that make us tired and boring zombies. Unless my positive symptoms were so severe that I'd be a crazy person that can't function in poverty and magic governed societies, then drugs that do the opposite of psychedelics would be ok. All paranormal activity has happened on psychedelics.. afterlife, astral projection, talking to the dead, etc.. But anyways.. Be careful with the booooze! _NAME_ died of liver failure from drinking.

I'll look up some inspirational people, books and podcasts and get my thoughts and notes organized and then I'll ask you for recommendations.

175971150,"Hi, I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for almost 30 years now. I use several different strategies to keep me sane. One thing that works for me when I am feeling hopeless is I get in touch with nature. For example, even during this pandemic, I make sure to either take a walk at my local park, roller skate by the bay, bike ride at the boardwalk, etc. These activities allow me to meditate and decompress from whatever has triggered my anxiety or depression at that moment in my life. Talking it out with someone understanding of my situation has helped me too. Yoga is amazing for releasing all that negative tension and stress that triggers my anxiety. Now many areas are doing outdoor Yoga. Also, there is YouTube where there are many FREE Yoga videos you can follow at home. Counseling is usually my last resort when I no longer have control over my emotions and suicidal thoughts start taking over. Any of these above strategies may help you out too, even if it is online counseling via Zoom f

I was a few days ago when I went on that hike because I couldn't sleep when I tried to at 5am because the cats were meowing and scratching at the carpet.. So I took a lower dose of Vyvanse (40mg) in the morning and slept in the evening. Right before I sleep, I do a breath-in (God/Mantra) and breath-out (God/Mantra).. I could explain it later if you want... I learned it from _NAME_ (He's a spiritual entertainer or philosopher that studied Eastern philosophy/religion/spirituality but when I focus on those two points while breathing, I don't think..

This thread is for people like myself who want to exchange information about the difficulties we voice hearers deal with, that non-voicehearers don't/can't understand, including professionals.

Why doesn't it occur to intelligent outsiders that it's possible for other parts of the brain to figure out how to talk to the so-called conscious mind? Conscious minds, in real life, talk to each other all the time, using our vocal chords. Why is it so impossible to believe that different parts of the brain can talk to other parts? What say you?"

175971171,"if the symptoms of sz are ever going to improve then it could be apter for conflicted duality to transition into blended singularity. ironically it could ease the burden of black hole style singularity on local culture. trial and error could transition into just experimenting and believing could transition into just subscribing. it could help the grind gravity to be more bearable. about a decade ago i posted about vicarious magnetism, compound channeling and that one doesn't equal one. with a bit of omnisight i would tip anyone starting out with sz to try and channel singularity culture rather than duality culture. the aspects consequentiality could be easier. it's a big ask and i have altruistic intentions like any good minded person but i think it's a practical journey worth going on for anyone with sz or not."

175971181,Hi First of all welcome to the forum. What you are experiencing is a common symptom of anxiety are you feeling anxious? If you are then there is lots you can do to help and by reducing any anxiety you may have should see an improvement in you having to swallow all the time. Have a look at our resources section for some useful self help sites on the web you could also go and speak with a school councillor if you have one. _PERSON_

175971185,"So much apathy.. I tried to make it like that productive week I had. I don't know what I did that made me feel better. I took another microdose yesterday (Just like I did on the 8th of January) and took 600mg of NAC again. Nothing. I'm not motivated when I'm in a good mood (From phenibut) or apathetic. I don't know what to do. I had apathy since I was 10-12 years old. I'm extremely unhappy. ""Avolition” is a term used to describe the lack of motivation or ability to do tasks or activities that have an end goal, such as paying bills or attending a school function. Avolition occurs most commonly in schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder."" ""What are the 5 A's of schizophrenia? Five constructs (the 5 “A”) were identified as negative symptoms namely affect (blunted), alogia, anhedonia, asociality, and avolition and were clustered into two factors: one including blunted affect and alogia and the other consisting of anhedonia, avolition, and asociality (Table 1)."""

175971197,"_NAME_, Don't panic! Keep eating and you call that someone right back this instant and ask them to have that specialist get in touch with you or provide you a way to get in touch with them. This is NOT a matter of being a ""bother"" ...this is your health avid your life and you deserve and owe yourself finding help no matter where you live or how you think your eating/weight disorders might be categorized. Do not fear just because you feel unsure. Rather, be bold because you're unsure what's going on. That's the whole point! I'm not sure where you live, but I took the liberty of researching multiple resources that have lots of info, links, suggestions, hotlines, support networks etc. not only in North America, but internationally as well. I am confident that somewhere in the links below you can find accessible help. From my reading, eating disorders present as symptomatic expressions of emotional imbalances and they are curable. Bulemia, anorexia, and over-eating all have cross-associations so don'
t rule out anything just because you think you're underweight or whatever. I'm no expert by any stretch, but I am damn good researcher. Eat and start reaching out to some places.

175971198,"Therapy is not a magic cure-all, it doesn't work for everyone. He has made it clear to you that it wasn't helping him, by continuing to push therapy you just show him that you aren't listening. Instead of trying to propose therapy in ""so many ways"", propose something OTHER THAN therapy. Eg. a diagnostic visit with someone other than a therapist, who is qualified to identify if he might benefit from medication, or sitting down with him and looking through a job listing to see if there is anything that he might want to do and encourage him to apply."

The request you make to your company's attorneys should be accompanied by a brief letter from your PCP stating that you either are in a high risk category or would be taking an otherwise unnecessary health risk.

This year I went to the gym when I had the chance and didn't stress about what I was eating. This year has been hard in the sense of my eating and exercise but as i reflect on this week I realize how much progress I truly have made.

175971222,"It does sound like an unusual diagnosis, because usually bipolar disorder can only be determined by observing a pattern of behavior over time. And usually the meds prescribed are mood stabilizers in addition to antidepressants. But I'm no doc, just the parent of an adult son struggling with bipolar disorder 1 for six years now. He's had four hospitalizations in this time, not because he was suicidal but because he had psychotic episodes. Bipolar 2 is not as severe. Again, I'd start reading stuff and find out if you think it fits. And a diagnosis is just a start, to get you the right treatment. It's very difficult to figure all this out. The very best of luck to you. (Also, you're the age a lot of people are first symptomatic.)"

175971230,"I don't think there's a timetable when you're supposed to over your grief and ready to be ""normal."" Perhaps your grief and sadness were just not allowed to be expressed in a way that helped you heal. When I lost my husband, I got great guidance from my therapist. He told me there was no getting over my loss, and I shouldn't even try to get over it. Instead, I should ""relocate"" my husband to another place in my being or consciousness. That was beautiful. It helped me find more happy moments thinking of him. I eventually cried less and could think of him without sadness. I'd say it took me more than a year. Until you can think of your brother and aunt fondly, lovingly, without being overcome with sadness you are not really in a place where you can be free with your fiance. It will happen. But for now, you do need to give yourself time to tuck these special people into another part of your being, where you can safely access them. Different than when they were living, they nonetheless will always b
e a part of you. When you're no longer afraid of losing connection to them, in this special way, you will be able to be fully present with your fiance."

It seems like a lot of my behaviors these days, although not many people can see it, are related to my past psychotic episodes. The impulsivity is related, I think. I am not blaming it on that, but it's certainly a factor. What's been helping me lately in living the good life is pursuing gratifications and seeking something outside of my own head to contribute to or otherwise do. I have been teaching as a volunteer, which is something outside of myself, and that has been good. I have also been trying to reach out to friends. That is also good. It is hard, but good."

175971265,"There must be reasons that you know. Things aren't perfect for everyone and it's ok to feel sad. You have a lot to say all the time and you're a good person. Think of everything as a problem that has to be solved. Eventually things will be better and you'll learn and find a way to be happy by ditching old habits and forming new ones. Or it's just a mood problem with your brain chemistry but that can always be changed. There's a lot of things happening in your life with your mom, moving, job, fiance, mental illness. I read that post you've made and you've come a long way. It reminded me of those dark days that I've had with psychosis and depression. I remember just walking to school with my earbuds in and every time I listen to those songs, it reminds me of those cold dark winters where nothing really made sense and it still doesn't make sense but I'm still pushing forward. I'm in a better place now except for all of the overthinking and judgements from people. But I like being a little mental.. You 
probably already know that. Everyone is crazy in some way and I've felt completely mentally stable to the point where I had no challenges and nothing to move towards. You always have to keep moving. It can feel like crap with everything always being a problem but that's what makes us human. It's a circle of the bad and good. I don't believe there's such thing as heaven or hell because you need to see hell to appreciate heaven and a bit of heaven to give hope to get through hell. All the good memories you've had and the hope for the future is what keeps people going. The unknown is what makes life worth living. Bad things are seductive and cool and everything is perfect."

These day I am kind of sad from having the anxiety condition. I like to be alone though. I think it isn't good to be alone ya. I don't know what to do about that. I just think when my medication works then I would be better ya. Thanks. 12 More On Anxiety Panic Disorders How Social Media Affects Your Mental Health CBD And P

175971281,You ever feel sometimes that things are too good? I have a good job. I’m studying successfully. I have a balanced mental state. Everything is going good despite there being a pandemic going on. Inside my mind it wants to push a reset button. Wants me to go off my meds and go crazy. Be delusional and starving myself and washing my hands obsessively worried that if I don’t something bad will happen. I don’t want that. By mind drifts to it. Wants the chaos. I wish these thoughts would just go away.

175971286,"Thank you for your answer, it helped, your diagnosis sound complicated tho, good luck in therapy. What i meant in 'feel like a normal person' is just understanding what things are and doing them from an inner motive, with my disorder i cant understand why people do things, even the most simple such as making food for themselves, cleaning, i dont feel like a normal person in any aspect i can think of, so the inner understanding of 'i want to do it because i like it' or whatever is where i was aiming"

175971291,"I've had this problem for years. I recommend a pirate's bath (a washcloth at the sink), dry shampoo and just trying to keep the sweatier parts clean. Another thing that kinda worked for me was putting myself on a shower schedule. I told myself I can shower 3x a week and choose the days, as long as a reached my goal of 3 days a week. It worked sometimes."
175971292,Can’t wait to go to sleep. It’s been a long day
175971293,I think I'm prone to seizures and fainting. I always thought that because of certain ways I feel sometimes. Right now I'm laying in bed feeling like I could pass out. Almost like I'm going in and out of conciousness or something idk its weird.

175971301,"So in the past few weeks, I've been seeing way too many blades. Letter openers. Scissors. People caring them in holsters. Kitchen knives. Table knives. Anything like this... I get really anxious. I have been depressed, and in the past have had major depression, anxiety, self harm, and a bit of suicidal thoughts. That was years ago. Now I'm currently depressed and anxious, and determined not to go down the road of self-harm and abusing alcohol again. But yet, I'm always thinking about blades, and they're everywhere! Also, thinking about blood. I see it in my head, I try to push it away but it keeps coming back. Scenes with it, bleeding, just in general - to not get into the details. It's quite draining for me to pretend everything's ok, when I'm quite worried about what this could become. How do I get these thoughts to go away?! I just feel so exhausted from trying to be stronger than I feel. Why has this suddenly come into my life so much? What does this mean? Does anyone else ever get this way? Ho

175971304,My therapist and I decided today that I'm not going back to school. My therapist thinks it's too big of a trigger for me and it's something I probably can't handle. They're probably right
175971305,"I feel like now that I'm getting older, I've crossed the boundaries between my mom being as a mother and her personal life. Like that's why I have to walk away when she talks with her friends about personal things - And I don't even want to hear about those things so I walk away. She tried to make a good life for me but I didn't have the common sense that I needed. _PERSON_ told me that I have no common sense. It's true! I don't.. Maybe it's the autism or something. I also think it's the reason as to why I did so many drugs and at such high doses."

175971309,I agree too. I felt this way with my first psychiatrist which led me to thinking how unhelpful it was. I did not return to that psychiatrist. It can also make us feel worst if we do not understand. UA
175971310,I don't feel like telling my doctor about that list of things. I don't feel as happy as I did last night so I'd just read it in monotone and confusion.
175971311,About to take one
175971312,"Well, I've had depression so no need to be too envious. It just isn't existential. I thought about this a bit more. I don't think lack of existential issues is about my age. I think it's because I know what I want to do. I've known for a long time now and I'm even willing to sacrifice most other things to pursue it."
175971313,"When I became psychotic I was overworking myself, the T basically told me that you always have a choice, you don’t have to do anything....now there will be varying levels of consequence but generally things won’t be as bad as you think. For example, if you’re stressed why not postpone getting the tree, do you even need a tree they are expensive and die quickly. Why not get a mini tree you can use year after year, maybe even a predecorated one....look for alternatives.....things don’t have to be a certain way."
175971314,"I feel sad. Just real sad. I feel this way every weekend. Cuz not much is going on. I should be happy I'm off from work, but idk.

175971317,I’d hate to know what would’ve happened to me if my parents weren’t so against pdocs and Ts and I was treated as a teen. It could’ve been a bad thing....or good. Idk. Being on that poison at that age would’ve ruined the good things of my teens and 20s and possible earlier hospitalizations than 2015. Ugh.
175971318,Good morning everyone. How is everyone? I'm more okay than I have been this week. That's progress. _PERSON_
175971319,I guess this is going to be another week at least.
175971320,I understand. Been there. I have a different perspective than some because my dad comited suicide and I've thought of it. What stoped me was not wanting my family to go through the pain again. I've had lots of therapy and it's been 20 years. I can finally talk about my experience to others. I don't want to cause anyone that much pain. That is a dark hopeless place to be. It is possible to survive. I know many people who have committed themselves to local hospitals to help get through. Keep talking about it....your not alone.
175971321,"_PERSON_, There's something that has caught my attention, and it's ""intuition."" Beliefs we have that we don't even know why or how, but they are their. We can't even detect them at first or a million glances later. They are right under our nose and we never knew them, we could never articulate them. Intuitions of space and time, intuitions that there is an external world out there, our concept of relationsal properties in math, intuitions of when we communicate. And then I look at nature, and I can't help but come tot he conclusion that nature has intuitions on how to create life with such complexity, as if nature has done this for eternity, and matter has this entire intrinsic nature from eons and eons ago, and that it just knows what to do. I have much more to say on all of this but, it just makes me wonder how deep our intuitions go."
175971322,"I can see the similarity in our situations. My in law is quite well off but because my wifes mother asked her to care for her father, she said she would. Mom was a saint of a person who my wife loved with all her heart. Yes my in law is manipulative and demanding. I should have said no to him moving in but at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. As for your son and his girlfriend It was a profound thing you did by helping them. I know you said your son was worthless but I hope this is not true. Perhaps in time he will mature and be the son you always wanted. Sometimes we do the best we can given our circumstances. I am now trying to make the best of a bad situation. I am not perfect myself so who am I to judge others."
175971323,"There are not any magic words I can give you to make you feel better, but I can be a listening ear. Depression does rob us of our lives quite often. Even if it is not laying in bed all day, it stops us from enjoying our life when we should. Just keep seeking help and doing what you can. Not much else anyone can do besides that."

175971333,"I saw my psychiatrist. I wrote my psychedelic trauma before I saw him and read it out to him. He said it's very disturbing - Because it is. He's going to write instructions for my doctor to put me on ""Invega Trinza"" - So I'll be getting that injection every 9 weeks. I told him that the olanzepine is a life saver for me and he was surprised that it helps with dissociative panic attacks. I told him that I asked my doctor for 10mg Dexedrine tablets and he gave me two weeks of 5mg tablets so my psychiatrist thinks that my doctor is responsible enough to deal with the stimulant doses. So far things are good. I read a chapter of the book I'm reading before the appointment - Not sure what to do now but I'll sit in the living room.. Hopefully no panic attack this evening =]"
175971334,"Could be sinus infection,allergies, bronchitis, lower respiratory or other lung infection, pneumonia possibly...Please don't worry yourself, sick. Are you taking blood thinners? Are you able to see a naturopath or an allopath for a diagnoses? Are you waiting for an upcoming app.? Raw, local honey & lemon juice in herbal teas(I like TraditionalMedicinal teas) could be helpful as well as a clove of raw, crushed garlic, 2-3x,a day and wild oil of oregano, 1-2 drops in 00 capsule(fill rest of capsule with coconut/avocado oil),twice a day. Higher dose of natural Vit C(or Amla) may help. Higher dose Vit D3 for 4-5 days could help. These simple home methods can help while you're waiting to be seen by a pro. I'm writing what I would do in your situation. If you are on blood thinners (garlic thins the blood) or other pharmaceuticals, I'd check for contraindications before trying anything.

175971351,"I listened to a radio interview with her, it's probably the same you found. I don't know if there is one with video, sorry. It makes sense. Love isn't enough... for what? The title implies some goal to reach with the child. This isn't “love”, to begin with. Love has no purpose. If you love your son, the child, as he is, is enough. That written, I understand that some context is very difficult, and it's normal that you wish a good life for your son, so you need to teach him social rules. My point is that the title implies that love is something that it isn't 'though. I hope that she doesn't mistake “love” for something else, considered that it's an important part of a relationship. _PERSON_: did you read this book? What is “enough”? Nice saying. I find it true. I read once a psychologist (_PERSON_? Not sure) writing: “people become evil, because they strive to be good”. I think it's appropriate sometimes. Lol I am exhausting too... Nope, there isn't anything."

175971377,Hi _PERSON_ That’s great you have got the all clear but sorry to hear it’s still causing you anxiety. I went through a period were I continually checked my lymph nodes and ended up making them swell up due to checking them all the time. Try and do something to take your mind of things and use your coping skills to help with your anxiety _PERSON_
175971378,"But I must look at the present moment which is good now and forget. But sometimes it's hard to forget. I get addictive flashbacks of standing up for myself because I never did. The only time I did was when I said ""Shut up"" while at the house on our lunch break and stormed off then he drove off back to work, leaving me there to think about what I did and have to apologize. It was pure manipulation. The ""My real dad pays for the food"" was physical abuse which isn't even 1% as bad as the psychological/mental/emotional."
175971379,"I feel like smoking the cigarettes I bought in Argentina. I am now back in the USA, where I see that Covid-19 cases are ballooning. This is making me quite nervous. Also I think being back at my parents' house is destroying my self-esteem."
175971380,"It’s good that you’re writing in. You sound a lot like me at your age. Mental illness and negative. My mental illness was and still is, bipolar I, which has the full mania. You said your girlfriend had that. I have my mental illness much better under control. I do not scream at anybody like your girlfriend does. There’s only 1 reason for that: I take Lithium for the mania and Mirtazapine for the depression. I also don’t have longtime negativity that I had for decades because I read a column on being positive that said, going into a problem, believe that you can solve it. Here’s what happened after I read that. My son comes in and says, “The car won’t start. It’s in the backyard.” I think, ""I don’t know what to do. We have a narrow driveway and you can’t into the backyard with a big wrecker. I’ll wait until my wife comes home and ask her what to do.” Then I remembered the column on being positive. I remembered what I had told myself to do the next time I have a problem: An
d that is, next time you have a problem, don’t think about the problem, the problem is not the problem. The problem is your negative thinking that you can’t solve the next problem. So my plan was, the next time I have a problem, get the column on being positive down from the bulletin board and read it in an effort to clear my unconscious mind of negativity. I started reading the column, and by the 3rd or 4th paragraph I said, “_NAME_’s” What was _NAME_’s? It was as garage a few blocks from where we lived that had a small wrecker that pulled a car out of our backyard several years earlier. I wasn’t even thinking about the problem, I was reading the column on how to solve problems by being positive that you can solve it before you start thinking about the problem. And just by reading the column, it had cleared my unconscious of negativity. That same unconscious, cleared of negativity, then set out to solve the problem. And it did. Before my wife got home. I was stupdified. Let me guess, you were r
aised in a negative household, and at a young age you learned to be negative. So, like I was, you're working against negativity and a mental illness, depression in your case, bipolar in mine. That is an uphill climb. Mayoclinic.org says about TMS, which you said you’ve tried, is “Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. TMS is typically used when other depression treatments haven't been effective.” Have you tried any medicine for your depression? Does that run in your family? Anyway you can find out if your girlfriend is taking any medicine, or has, and which kind if possible? Lithium stabilizer and Mirtazapine anti-depressant has helped me."
175971381,I just swallowed them now.
175971382,I guess I’ll always be known by many as “the mentally ill disabled guy” But through therapy I’m starting to realize that I’m so much more than this.

174363490,"It’s good that you reached out. It sounds like you have had some rough parts. One of the roughest is that so many bipolars who go in for help as depressed are never asked by psychiatrists if they’ve ever had trouble sleeping, ever had a racing mind, to see if they might be bipolar, not just depressed. That’s rough also to know that they are being miss-treated by the very people who are supposed to be taking care of them. You say, “My symptoms leading up to this are all textbook...and I was treated for years with heavy duty antidepressants before those medications finally contributed to my severe and uncontrollable manic episode, thus requiring hospitalization and med changes due to my diagnosis.” Yes, anti-depressants do throw a bipolar into mania and panic attacks, which is why they need to get the diagnosis right, for miss-diagnosis leads to miss medications. That’s why, in addition to the anti-depressant (Mirtazapine in my case), a bipolar needs a stabilizer such as Lithium, which is 
what I am taking, to put a cap on the anti-depressant. So, we’ll say you showed signs of bipolar in your teens, we’ll say 20, and not diagnosed as bipolar until your 30s, that’s about 15 years of wasted time that it took medicine to get the basic diagnosis right. 15 years? It should take them closer to 15 minutes. That all here in the 2000s, the era of modern medicine. They could also have the patient fill out some tests on the first or second visit, do you have racing thoughts, so the doctor can have that tool. Yes, people do take advantage of those who are down. You said, “The knowing that this is a life sentence that requires lifelong medications that you hope and pray will keep you stable, and feeling that you don’t even really know who you actually are anymore, because you’ve been plagued for so long... “ My grandmother was bipolar, but they didn’t know what that was in the 1930s and 1940s (they called it schizophrenia back then), and they also didn’t have any medicine for it. So they j
ust put her in a state mental institution, 150 miles from her home, and that’s the way she lived her life. So as hard as we think we’ve had it, we ain’t had nothing compared to what she went through for her entire adult life. We can be very thankful that they’ve invented the modern medicines that we have. You say, “I want to help others as others have helped me and make a difference.” That attitude could be very important to you, because I’ve found that trying to help others can reverse the psychic energy from worrying about ourselves to worrying about somebody else. It’s the same amount of worrying, it’s just going outward."
175971460,"Weight gain or weight loss goes hand in hand with increased anxiety. Anxiety is a culmination of worrying thoughts. My experience is to work on stressful thoughts that are limiting me. As I look at the truth of each of my stressful thoughts, ( I’ve done a lot of _NAME_’s The work https://thework.com/). It’s a method of dropping limiting thoughts I’m suffering over to find the truth. It’s in finding the truth your whole system aligns. And the magic of the weight gain or loss is affected too. All of you is lining up with the truth. For now. You ( and millions ) are in chaos or confusion and your whole system is joining along. Showing you the train you’re on. Get off the train by investigating the truth of each limiting brief. I’m so grateful for this work. And it’s work. ( like Deep internal personal surgery). And it’s so worth it.

175971465,Hi _PERSON_. I would agree that going back to your psychiatrist sounds like a good idea. There’s no way to know if she’ll take you back or not unless you reach out. If you can’t meet in person because of the pandemic she might talk over the phone or something. I’m sorry about the nightmares - that sounds awful. I would talk to your psychiatrist about that too. The more open you are with her the better she can help you. That’s what I’ve found with the counselors I’ve been to. I hope things get better for you.
175971466,"This describes how I ended up on this forum as well, more or less. I had met someone who I thought fit pretty well into my model of 'the kind of person I like'. Obviously, my first instinct was to run away. I have a hard time explaining to people why that is - generally people, psychs included, misunderstand. Losing my initial representation of them by actually getting to know them was a kind of subdued long-term trauma in itself, but once I was through that, things actually turned out quite well. (Admittedly, we've only ever interacted online.) I'm not trying to answer your rhetorical questions, just tossing in a few of my own thoughts. I don't know. I've always felt oppressed by the presence (and memory) of other people (though there are gradations to it), so maybe it's innate in some way. But the wall has also developed a lot over time. Lately, I just accept that the wall is there, and try to find cracks in it when I can. Something apt that was posted recently by our resident polar bear: When yo
ur real self is already vague or amorphous, then exposing it, reifying it, is destructive - because it changes to fit a new shape that no longer belongs to you. Like you said, when you internalize people so easily, it's very difficult to get them to truly leave. Are you happy to see her when she comes back? The pop-psych understanding of introversion is that introverts need to use energy to be around other people and recharge when alone. So, on that level, it's completely normal. Many schizoids may experience that to an extreme degree, but that's a quantitative difference, not a qualitative one - I don't imagine it would be too much of a stretch for most people to understand? I think there are also more happy, successful relationships where the partners need to spend a lot of time apart than is typically realized."
175971467,"I avoided therapy and medication for as long as I possibly could because I thought I would eventually get over it and learn how to handle situations better by myself or eventually grow out of having such depressing thoughts. I did not want to rely on medication and be chained to it for the rest of my life. I did not want to go to therapy because I thought it was stupid and the times I did try to see a therapist it just never worked out because I still felt like they did not understand when I tried to explain what I was feeling and it didn't help that their responses sounded so generic. It wasn't until I found myself in a such a dark state of mind that I literally scared myself. I am 30yrs old now and sometimes I feel ridiculous that I still feel the same if not worse than I did when I started to feel depressed when I was 13yrs old. How is it possible to still feel the same after all these years? Honestly my only solution was to see a psychiatrist and a therapist. Although I will admit the psychiatr
ist did not work out so well because all she did was prescribe me a million medications and she literally could not remember why I was even seeing her, I had to remind her almost every single time we had a session what was wrong. She did not care about my condition, her solution was just more pills. I ended up stopping the meds but continued with therapy. I was determined to find a therapist that would actually LISTEN and I did. Try finding a therapist that you can connect with, I don't think therapists are ""one size fits all"" so you just have to find one that helps you see your life in a different light. And I think seeking help does not make you weak, its hard to accept what you are going through and taking the time to really work on getting better is incredibly brave."

175971496,"Yeah that's the plan. I went back into my room and was having a sort of mental breakdown and then my mom put my sister on FaceTime and she said that I could use her room and that it doesn't bother her - But then my mind just went blank. I lost my thought of what I was going to say. That's the problem with me talking to people. I write 1000x better than I can talk. It's like, - When I'm talking to someone on the phone, in person even - My mind goes completely blank. I wonder if the olanzepine kicked in yet and that's why idk. I feel horrible but I also am OK with it and like it because my mind is trying to figure things out. I used to be so nihilistic and depressed that I did nothing for myself. I said to my mom ""I accomplished nothing"" but she told me not to think that because I managed to complete high school after I got out of the psych ward, I've been able to hold down jobs, I'm a good son, brother, etc.. I'm just having a really hard time. I try not to blame people - I chose what happened to 
me - But I've been traumatized. I have learned from my mistakes though and things will be better eventually."

I’ve had sever social anxiety since I was in the fourth grade and now I’m a freshman in college. I am plagued with anxiety every single day and it does not help that “intro to public speaking” is a requirement for my major. I am actually taking intro to public speaking now and I have a speech on Tuesday that I have been dreading since I got my syllabus. A back story on my speech history: every time I go to give a speech, I feel like I can’t breathe and I eventually start crying before I can even get one word out. I’ve seen a psychiatrist and tried every type of medicine but nothing seems to work. I’ve also talked with a therapist but I still didn’t get any sense of relief. Basically I just want to meet people who are like me and see what they do to cope with their anxiety. I really want to be able to give a speech without embarrassing myself someday so any suggestions are greatly apprec

174363556,"People can live with voices as long as they aren't like messed up telling you to do things or very loud screaming at you. I feel like my voices were mostly hypnotic ones. Most of the voices would happen after I wake up and before I went to sleep. In the day, they were very random and rarely made sense. I 100% knew that they weren't real (Except when my name was being called when no one was in the house - I'd still check). It was stressful but I knew it was because I was really stressed out ""Oh I'm hearing my name and no one is there.. I must be freaking out"". I didn't notice that the voices weren't normal - Even though I never had them my whole life... Which is another strange dimension to this. I think it was because I was asked if I was hearing voices but I was kind of pissed off because they were making a big deal about it. I knew it was stress. That's all I attributed them to and still do.. Although it could be a sign of mental deterioration and psychosis.. Yet psychosis is a checklist of sym
ptoms.. Idk cuz intervoice is a thing.. Idk what they do or say over their but they must think that it's an extra part of cognition like how every brain is different and some parts of the brain are stronger or weaker than other parts. I should look into it but I feel repelled that on one side, people with schizophrenia are tortured by voices and on their side, they celebrate them. They raise awareness that it isn't mental illness but what does that mean for people that do have mental illness and hear voices? Some are mentally ill and others aren't. But 1 in 4 people or something have mental illness so I don't get it. Anyways rant over.."

175971514,I have an interview with the local newspaper.
175971515,"I just went through the most traumatic event of my life thus far recently. I lost my dad due to a massive heart attack that happened suddenly. Growing up we were close and then we drifted apart. We started to repair our relationship when I got pregnant with my daughter 3 years ago. When she was born she really stole his heart, he would do anything for her. He became a major support person for me, as I am raising her by myself. Losing him has taken the biggest toll on me. The day before his funeral I started to go through multiple episodes of severe panic attacks. I’ve never been through a panic attack before, although I have dealt with anxiety all my life. During the funeral was even worse to the point where I almost fainted. Since then, I’ve been hospitalized a few times because of how severe my panic attacks are. I can always tell and feel when one is about to come on. I’ve been in therapy for a few weeks now and although it’s helping to talk about it, I feel as if it’s not actually mak
ing a difference. I feel as if I’m surrounded by people who don’t take my panic attacks seriously and are willing to help me cope. I feel selfish at times because I know my family is grieving along with me but at the same time, I can’t stop my panic attacks and anxiety. I keep playing the last days with my father over and over again on a constant loop. I think what makes it worse is the fact that I had to make the decision to take him off of life support because my mom was too distraught to do so. I was also in charge of all the funeral arrangements, down to writing his obituary. I had a lot on my plate and when I finally crashed because of all the pressure it’s like nobody is here to help me. I’ve been there for everyone else but nobody is here for me right now. The other night I went through a really bad episode to the point where I was struggling to breathe. I kept looking to my mom to help me and I asked for a cold rag to help me calm down. She just sat there and looked at me like this wasn’t 
phasing her. When I finally got myself together and explained to her how I felt she just said “I didn’t know what to do I’ve never had one of those before”. Even though I was telling her what to do to help me. I just truly feel like I’m in this alone while also having the weight of the world on my shoulders. I still have to raise my daughter and deal with her constantly asking for her “Pop Pop” and missing him."

So, now that its two years, she is 30 and i am 31 she told me she is getting married with the same guy and wants me to go back home so that it will be easier for both of us and may help us in being happy once again.

175971544,"Hi Angels007 and welcome to _PERSON_ and the A/P Forum! I understand how you are feeling. It can be exhausting and frustrating dealing with the challenges of anxiety! It is okay and actually healthy to acknowledge these feelings...for a time. Then after having a short time of cathartic expression and acceptance of these feelings, it would be a good plan to let the longing to feel better again, motivate you towards motivation. Keep working new management tools/techniques/plans. Together with your doctor and therapist, and on your own with self help, much can be gained in an accumulative sense. You never know when you are going to find the right combination of coping mechanisms that is going to be the key to your best recovery! There IS a lot of trial and error...and it does take time and resolve to keep trying new things...but it will happen with time and continued efforts. Keep posting with us if you find it helpful.

174363633,Early treatment of schizophrenia may not slow disease progression Saw this new study.....when I first had my psychosis they were all about FEP and early treatment that if you didn’t get treatment right away the duration of untreated psychosis would be bad for you etc. Well with sz apparently even if you get treatment the sz will catch up over time. I’m specifically thinking of what happened to my cognition years after treatment with no further episodes. I guess it makes more sense now and may be related to the original illness but delayed and not the medication....
175971575,Just to let y’all know. There’s a new movie release out about a girl with schizophrenia. It’s called Fear of Rain. I haven’t watched it yet but rented it for tomorrow in my Xbox. I’m sure u can rent it anywhere if it’s not Netflix or something.

I think that's a nice problem to have because me remembering less dreams means me remembering less nightmares. I did have an odd dream a couple of nights ago, however. I dreamed that I had rented a trailer that was right in the middle of the town dump. It made no sense to me. Weird."
175971579,"You're welcome. It's good that you are checking back with us. It's good that you are trying to do some of the things that have been mentioned here. How does she have access to the $450 of rent money? Is it laying around the house? Do you have a joint checking account? I think you need to open your own, separate checking account, so you can pay the basic bills first, like rent and electricity and food. Then afterwards, if there is any money left over, you can perhaps think about other things. The only thing that is keeping you and her off the street is your ability to pay the rent, and food, etc. It is for your safety and hers to pay those basic bills, first. Let this first incident of her finding the money, be a warning to you. If you deposit your paycheck in a checking account, and then pay the rent with a check, the money can't go missing. Since you are the only one working, you don't have to ask her permission to open up a separate checking account. Cash money can always be found in the house. I 
think you are good for her and she is good for your. You two need to stick together. It's not her fault that she is having these difficulties. I hope you can compliment her for the good things she does, to build her self-confidence so that she can love herself. Can you tell her you love her every now and then? Can you get her to go to a free clinic? Can you get her to take her medicine? Believe going into the problem that it can be solved and it will increase your chances that it will. One problem at a time, and be positive about that problem. Thank you for helping her so much."
175971580,Not really. I drink passionflower tea on occasion; it gives me a short respite without some of the issues with a benzodiazepine. I may try CBD too. And I take a sleeping pill on occasion. I’m not willing to take a benzodiazepine on a regular basis and my therapist believes they’re counterproductive in the long run. I’m considering an SSRI. I would like to avoid that but I’m open to it and I have an upcoming meeting with a doc to discuss.

175971582,"Luvs, so sorry to read how the anxiety has it's grip on you again. Wellbutrin is an anti-depressant & it can cause anxiety as a side effect, not sure you are aware of this. A lot of people cannot handle Wellbutrin for this reason. Many years ago I was diagnosed with both depression & anxiety, I was put on Buspar and did well. It sounds like you need to have a talk with your dr about getting the anxiety under control & also doing self help. Keep in mind not only does a surgeon dictate the need for a mastectomy but your insurance plays a larger role in approving any surgery. Good luck with your appt on the 18th, but please listen to you dr. My own personal standpoint is I would not entertain the thought of getting pregnant until I was in a better place mentally, and especially not with the pandemic. Take care."
175971583,"Hi CSA08, sorry to read what you've been through but I'm familiar with some of it and while I know that each situation is different, here's mine and the outcome. I've been on BP medication for years. After a series of crappy events last fall including passing out and breaking a toe when getting up at 4:00 am, I was put through many heart tests because the ER thought I could have had a heart attack. This cranked up my anxiety (thinking it's my heart) and my BP but the irony is that I passed out because my BP was too low and my dosage was too high till that point. However, now the heart anxiety caused my BP to sky rocket despite my medication, and it had to be brought down immediately with clonidine. The heart tests came back fine but in my mind I still thought I was having heart problems. I was sure the doctors and tests missed something. The cardiologist and my regular doctor recognized that my bouts of anxiety (with palpitations) was causing the episodes of high BP, so they prescribed Lexapro on a 
daily basis and buspirone when needed for those strange anxious feelings. Since I could anticipate the anxiety attack, I learned that I could stop them by taking just half of the buspirone dosage I was given. I think knowing that I could do this has helped me tremendously to realize my anxiety could be controlled immediately. Lexapro will have a constant level of anti-anxiety medication in the blood which should help in general but the buspirone is what has helped me deal with the immediate attack of heart racing which I know is my anxiety. Time helps. I haven't needed the buspirone in months. Please speak to your regular doctor for some additional help in dealing with this. I hope you can get over this as I did."

175971586,"Welcome to the forum, Dsptial. Took a while for anyone to respond, but this is, after all, a schizoid forum. Your post is succinct and well written. I can relate to a lot of it. My experience has been that when I am pressured to sacrifice my solitude, my mood plummets and my need for isolation increases. When I am given enough space, I am more comfortable and more functional. I have a friend whom I see about once a month. I usually look forward to hanging out, but if I was expected to socialize with him more than once a month, it would become a chore. When I am given the space I need I'm more likely to be open to socializing because it's on my terms. I think that for schizoids, a deficit of solitude only makes the symptoms worse. If they really understood or cared, they would accept you the way you are."
175971587,"Which is what I suspect is the issue; this is being looked at the wrong way around. People don't get depressed because of an existential crisis, they already are depressed (or prone to become depressed) and use the existential crisis to focus it on. I agree. Belief is easier, and it's accepted without concern for its idiocy, because the person lacks the psychological skills to deal with reality. Belief is a symptom of a weak mind; a clutching at something to remove the burden of reality. The actual reality is: we don't know. We ave no idea what's 'real', but I'll put money on it being nothing we believe today. Religion should be seen as a mental illness. It's like people who make comments like, ""I prefer animals to people. because they don't let you down."" Of course they don't; they're animals. They don't have the complex emotions to form deep relationships, and they can't argue with you. People like that prefer their company, because they lack the skills to maintain complex human relationships. 
What I meant is that fear of death isn't of the act of dying; you fear what death represents to you. The loss of your family, your eventual irrelevance etc."

Anyways, I went ahead and stopped using the term man and mankind, and replaced it with human, humanity, and humankind. My editor said he was on the fence about my use of the gender for all of us as a collective, and it was only right after I thought about it. I wouldn't gender God or my use of the term ""Other"", so to use man as a collective would be to taint my work.

175971599,"I personally have a history of anxiety. I was officially diagnosed at 13. I am 20 years old now. I am unsure if my anxiety might have triggered my dizzy spells. If I were to take everything into consideration that's what it must be. I've had almost every test done to rule out anything else. For some reason, I have all of the evidence in front of me and I still refuse to believe it's anxiety. Like I mentioned earlier, I had it since I was 13 and not once did I have a dizzy spell especially one that was out of the blue. That's the hardest part about my situation, which is believing that anxiety is what caused my initial vertigo spells and the ones following that as well as the physical symptoms that I feel and go through on a daily basis. I've never had this happen to me before and I still don't feel right even during times when I feel calm. The physical symptoms that I would feel regarding anxiety were sweating, stomach issues, having to pee frequently, and an overall sense of tiredness/fatigue. And 
those symptoms would occur when I was getting myself ready for school and while I was in it and they would go away once I was home. Now I have my symptoms pretty much 24/7."

Its not the shrink himself that makes me feel that way, I have felt that way with all of my shrinks. Second, I know he is busy because the COVID-19 is also creating a mental health crisis. I always seem to convince myself that it is not that bad until it is to late. I am trying to be a bit proactive by calling him tomorrow. I have too many thoughts of suicide right now for my liking. My baseline does include some SI, but this is getting out of hand. The thing is, I don't want to die. I just want a break, a pause. But, I cannot see how to get one, so I focus on suicide. Normally, I go through a period of mania before depression. This time, I am just depressed. It is unusual for me. It makes me nervous because I don't have much past experience with this sequence of events, so I am unsure how it will turn out. I know a lot about suicide, includin
g what happens to those left behind. I don't want that for my family. So, I have tried for years to figure out how to make it an ""accident."" For the first time ever (and mind you, I have been trying to figure it out for a number of years now), I have figured out two plans. The only thing is, neither guarantee death, and have a strong possibility of just injuring myself and causing long-term disabilities instead. I don't really want to mention either to my husband (who I have been honest with about my struggles) or my shrink (simply because I don't want anyone knowing what the plans are, and thus removing the accident part). I have no intention or desire to act on these plans, but the fact that I am hatching them worries me. So, for the first time in a long time, I am going to consult my shrink at the early warning signs, not the late ones. Anyway, thanks for reading."

However, his moods change very quickly - almost every two weeks he is a changed person. He recently told me he might be bipolar II but is not yet diagnosed."" mayo.clinic.org says: •Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). •Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. So, bipolar I has mania, but bipolar II does not, but you said he thinks he's bipolar II (no mania), but feels he might be manic (which is bipolar I). So, that's not matching up. If he has full blown mania, the website says that's bipolar I (which is what I have. With no medicine, my mania c
an be really bad). If he does not have full blown mania, web says that's bipolar II. Both bipolar I and II have the below symptoms, website says: Mayo Clinic says ""Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: •Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired •Increased activity, energy or agitation •Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) •Decreased need for sleep •Unusual talkativeness •Racing thoughts •Distractibility •Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Does he have 3 of those? If he does, he's not depressed, he's manic-depressed, in my amateur view. Meaning, he's mis-diagnosed and miss-medicated, and the medicine (anti-depressant) may be sending him from depressed to manic (with no stabilizer like Lithium to control his mania)."

Another way of handling overstimulation is to challenge yourself a little at a time. Start with staying in the environment. Then if you can handle it, try it again for a little longer. Continue in this way. LIGHT Light, or the lack of, can affect how we feel. I recently wrote about how the dark outside can makes us feel sad and lethargic. But too much light and we may feel too energetic. I can’t imagine attending a light show with lasers and such. It would attack my sensitive eyes. Grocery stores can be hard to go too if they are too bright. I know this because this is the reason I will not shop there. That is okay because there are a lot more people for which the brightness of t
he light does not bother them. They are not losing money on account of me. And there other grocery stores at which I can shop. Read more here: https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/11/15/5-factors-in-overstimulation-and-bipolar-disorder /"

I'm on Vyvanse which helps a lot with the sedation. Stimulants don't ever give me psychosis but they do in like 90% of people with schizophrenia which is why I think something like modafinil would help you.

175278514,"Sorry for leaving one more comment, not trying to spam you. I’m from NYC so I feel your pain whoever you are! Luckily I live in Canada now and am a duel citizen, otherwise I would be a lot worse off than I am now haha! Please don’t take offence to this, but you definitely don’t have a heart problem OR need to be seeing a cardio! You described symptoms that I’ve been experiencing every single day more or less since approx 4 months ago. Now I’m getting worked up for a liver disease so it is possible you might have any number of things wrong with your liver (or kidneys for that matter) because gall stones don’t just happen to heathy individuals if you catch my drift. I’m not trying to alarm you, you won’t die so no need to go to an E.R. but book an appointment with your general doc and cancel the cardio, given that I also have been asthmatic since the day I was born, let me also reassure you it is not asthma. Also, given that I’ve been suffering from anxiety, depression and the likes
, I am very well versed in knowing what mental health changes could cause a person to experience symptomatically, and aside from the chest pain, that’s not anxiety or panic unless, you’re having other things happen as well above and beyond these symptoms that you’re just not aware of in the moment, I highly doubt it would be anxiety in this case... they would have told you at the E.R. If they thought you came in due to a severe panic. Please take my advice to go back to your GP and start by saying you are experiencing gall bladder or kidney infection or might have a gall stone of sorts, that will get them to look in the right direction and try to resolve it without running too many tests that are expensive the first time but then eventually you want to shoot for them to do an 3D-ultrasound of the general area to determine if they can see a stone blocking anything up from operating the way it should. Then from there you can decide if you want your entire gallbladder removed or you can just go on living l
ife with the pain in hopes that it will shift again some day soon and the pain will magically disappear until the stone loges itself in a new spot to cause pain elsewhere (which is what I’ve been doing for the past year since seeing the surgeon and deciding to try changing my diet and using exercise as a means of dislodging it or clearing it up naturally- unsuccessfully obviously considering I’ve been in pain for 4 months, I’m not managing as well and gallbladders are useless so I should’ve just had it removed anyways lol). Cheers! Shoot me a msg if you’ve got more questions, otherwise I hope this helps a little bit if not a lot!"
174363796,"I've had a depressing time. Now I'm not getting to deep into detail because I have no idea how much I can post. Yet, I want to see if I'm insane in a way. In a way I'm funny when I say these things but, let's get to the point. I have thoughts of pure apathy towards others in my family, towards my friends or whatever. People really piss me off. I'm sick of all of everyone's nonsense everywhere, and the **** they cause for this Earth. I don't want to live on it the way it's going, people just wont understand this though, they'd laugh at me I feel if I just opened up. I got made fun of as a kid in school and it was an all the time thing for quite a while. Now that's stuck in my mind. I still can't get out of this place where I was tortured in my head by these bullies in school or elsewhere. I still feel down and depressed all the time, I see things going on around me that depress me, and I think at times of even taking drugs and killing myself. I would like to know why I'm thinking like this or maybe 
seek out some guidance before I decide what to do with myself. Not that I'm necessarily killing myself. Though I hate people. I hate their ********. In a way I don't feel anything towards anyone anymore. It's all getting to me in a real personal way, like a complete let down is my life. I'm a loner and no one wants to hang it seems ever. I have schizophrenia and I hear voices and am doing fine with that, it's all good and I'm sane, sane is natural nowadays. Yet there's something else, this thought of complete hate and apathy towards every human being on this Earth. I feel we are the problem with the Earth going in the wrong direction with the environment and all. I really love animals but I can't feel for these human assholes, I'm not crazy, just please believe me I hate everyone. My own family I feel I don't want to be with most often, I don't even want to have friends and family around most often because I like to be alone now. I've adapted. Now it's like, whoever you are if you turn the wrong gear inside m
e I can flip and do something I might regret. I feel like hitting walls when someone beats me at a video game, and cutting their head off. It's just a impulse, or a urge. I don't like living anymore, I really don't like people around me, I don't want friends, I want to be lonely. I want to die! Yet no one gets it. They think I'm fine and jolly. _PERSON_ I hate that BS as well. If you look at me like everything's good I'll just hate that thought of you being there in my mind, in my thoughts, being around. It pisses me off truly. The voices will leave me in a completely hard time, I have to deal with it I know, but please don't judge me and put me down because of it? You get me like, people I feel feel things towards me that I don't like. I get mad because I believe people are out to make me look bad. Make me feel down because of my schizophrenia but I will do something one day I feel. Or maybe not, I feel I'm too much of a complete reject to do anything. So yea, all these thoughts, and what is it all? Depressi
on, psychosis, some ********. I have no freaking idea. Okay so let's get deeper. Possible trigger: I have these thoughts, of homicide and suicide and all these people really get to me deep inside enough to make me break and hit ****, hit walls, bash my head, whatever to get this stress off of my mind. It's a impulse just to get them back, to seek revenge for what they are and have done to me. It's this whole human race though because I see no one with real feelings ever! More like a bunch of assholes who don't take me as a real individual with a heart or anything that matters. What to do? I need some guidance please."

I was in my head and felt awkward and wanted to just be alone. But its getting better, been reminding myself to accept where I am. I wanted to pick up where I left off with friends and family but I've changed and so have they and I don't have to try to be the old me I think they expect me to be, just the me I am right now, depressed and awkward and feeling blah, and that's ok."

175971717,"My mom has been unhappy for as long as I can remember; however, it has gotten worst over the years. She has tried to kill herself at least two times that I'm familiar with. Shortened story of the last time: Last year she had lost her dad. Per usual she was taking it out on my dad and being really mean and rude to him, pushing him away. Eventually, he filed for divorced. This is after 20 - 30 years of abuse from her, and not the first time they had been separated. I watched her get thinner and thinner, and more reclusive. She would be there, but she wasn't. She took some pills one night and fell out of bed. She broke her nose, and didn't call anyone. It was the day before my baby reveal, that her brother showed up and took her to the hospital. Needless to say she didn't make it to the baby shower; however, the hospital let her go. This is her first grandchild of the family, and it really hurt me and upset me for her not to be there. Anyways, my brother flew home from Amsterdam after hearing how bad 
she was. Over the next couple of days, he and my husband took her back up to the hospital and had her committed. She was up at the hospital for 2 weeks or so. She was diagnosed with major depression and physcotic features. She was released with no plan of action, such as being enrolled in extensive therapy. She was cruel, terrified of going back to the hospital, and started messing with her medicine. We tried to get her enrolled in a new program, a nicer program, but at the end of the day it is up to her and she sabotaged it every way she could. She found a new doctor who messed with her medicine, and seems to be working better. However, during that time period we all pleaded with her to get the help she really needed. I got to a point where I gave her an ultimatum: she either gets help or I'm no longer part of her life. She has chosen the latter of the two. She refuses to get help. At the same time she is pleading with me over email and with family members for me to speak to her. She is playing the martyr an
d victim card. She has done this for as long as I have known her. She pushes everyone away, and once they are at their breaking point she starts playing the guilt card. I'm 8 months pregnant, I'm missing my mom, and I'm feeling so much guilt for having put up this boundary. I feel terrible that she is stuck in her apartment by herself during this quarantine. I feel so much guilt. But at the same time, this is the farthest I've ever gone and the longest I've ever gone to stick to my boundary. I don't know what I should do? Do I cave and talk with her or do I hold strong and prove a point?"

My sleep have been extremely messed up for a week. I woke up this morning and I just knew I couldn’t goto work. I couldn’t keep my eyes open for more than 5 seconds. I was extremely afraid to drive like that. Actually maybe I’m a bit manic because of the lack of sleep from this whole week. Man, 1 day that I can’t sleep and the WHOLE week is messed up and I get a bit sick with an episode. I texted my boss about staying home today.

175971760,"Many psychiatrists become doctors because psychiatry helps lots of people. And they find psychiatry as something that's fascinating to them because it changes the lives of so many folks suffering from mental illness in a positive way. However, those who become psychiatrists really have to pay their dues first. For some of them, medical school are the hardest years of their lives. Yet they are willing to go through all of that stress and hard work because they want to help people. Yes, I know psychiatrists make real good money. But to pay their dues like that because they want to help people, to me, is awesome and commendable."

If it doesn’t start working for you then they can try something different. Let us know how you’re doing. I like knowing I’m not alone, too."

174363921,"When I lower my antipsychotic, I have to do it slowly because the withdrawal can cause psychosis and depending on how long and severe it is, it could make everything worse. If I lower it slowly and the psychosis never stops, then it's confirmed that I have schizophrenia which would make it worth taking the antipsychotic. But then they'll change my diagnosis to half-autism (PDD-NOS) if I don't get psychosis and take me off disability. Then I'll work full time and if I don't get psychosis due to stress (Which can increase OCD related to half-autism), depression and trauma (Cured by my good psychedelic trips and made a bit worse by my bad psychedelic trips) then that's great but if I do get psychosis, then it will be changed to autism with psychosis due to stress and then I'll be put back on disability but it could take years. But before that, they'll want to put me on antipsychotics again and I don't want that. The brain can only take so much psychosis before it breaks. My negative symptoms were caus
ed by government and society conditioning and hopefully the rest will be gone if I'm on lower antipsychotic and gives me the strength to work full time again. I was supposed to wait until I'm 25 to stop the antipsychotic because then my brain will have mostly developed but I'm 23 now but don't want to risk brain damage from the antipsychotic until then. It's like a catch 22 and complicated. I just don't want to work right now because I want to spend time with my mom because she has cancer. Then if she dies soon, I'll be so emotionally damaged which is why I'm trying my best to prepare for my future. I wouldn't be able to work with my mental illness without her and she's my caregiver. I hate this. The only solution is to lower the invega injection to 100-50mg and keep my disability because it's less of a risk that I'll get psychosis if I stay on a lower dose of antipsychotic until I'm 25 (I think I figured it out..)"

175971793,"Hi austinw712, I am sorry to hear about the challenges that you are having. But it is good that you are reaching out for help. Even though you mentioned that you are having a hard time accepting that anxiety may be the root of your problem, remember that everyone experiences some kind of anxiety in their lives whether it is temporary or long term. It’s like a battle in the mind and even if we may never completely overcome it, we can learn to cope successfully. Our mind and body are closely connected, so lifestyle changes like diet and exercise are always beneficial whether you choose to take medication or not. It will take time and effort but overcoming or dealing with the problems we have in life can eventually help us to be better, just like fruits that struggle to grow in drier climates are in the end sweeter."

175971818,"Hello Cwa8807 Welcome to the family here at Inspire. The main thing I am feeling from reading your post is to say that you are lumping together two major problems! One major problem at a time, dear one. I am so sorry that you and your wife are having problems, but you are dealing with a very volatile situation there, not just her illness, but the present and future of 3 precious little men who are a part of you. My recommendation to you is that you focus on the one problem at a time, and the situation with your wife and sons are of prime importance. There is a possibility that the relationship with your wife may not improve, but....it is the one that you are in the middle of at the moment...deal with it FIRST. Maybe you have already decided to tune me out, but don't do that. I have been in a very similar situation in my own life, so I fully understand many of the things you are feeling, but.....at this very present moment, you can not trust your judgement on an alternative situation.....NOT UNTIL y
ou have fully dealt with where you are. Your wife has been diagnosed, so I assume she has been for some counselling, but I assume you 2 have not gone for any together...is that so? If not, then do so, for the sake of the children. They are being harmed by living in a household of pain and suffering...yes they are, regardless of their age. So Cwa8807....do the things which need doing, and when that is all accomplished , I can assure you that you will be much more capable of mapping out your own future. At your age I fully understand your need for love, comfort and a happy home...but first things first!"

Finding joy in the littlest thing, for example, the flowers in my garden or listening to the fountain gurgle, hearing the birds, sitting with the sun on my face. Even if for a few minutes. And sometimes, we have to force ourselves to do the things that will make us feel better, even if we don't want to do it right now like our exercise routine, medications, meditation, etc. Below are some excerpts taken from an article titled Comfort for the Depressed found on JW. org. Even if you are not religious, it has some wonderful practical advice and comfort for dealing with depression. You can always find out more on the website if you want to search for topics such as Depression, Anxiety, Stress, etc. There are terrific articles that deal with anything you can think of. I hope you are able to find some peace. ""Practical adjustments in lifestyle can also help one overcome a depressed mood. Physical exercise, eating wholesome food, getting fresh air a
nd sufficient rest, and avoiding excessive TV watching are all important. One woman has helped depressed ones by getting them to do vigorous walking. When a depressed lady said: “I don’t want to go for a walk,” the woman gently but firmly answered: “Yes, you’re going.” The woman reported: ‘We walked four miles [6 km]. When we returned, she was tired, but she felt better. You can’t believe how helpful vigorous exercise is until you try it.’"" ""However, sometimes it is impossible to defeat depression completely, even when everything has been tried, including medical therapies. “I have tried everything,” a middle-aged woman said, “but the depression remains.” Similarly, it is now often impossible to heal the blind, the deaf, or the lame. Yet, depressed ones can find comfort and hope by regularly reading God’s Word, which provides the certain hope of permanent relief from all human ills.—Romans 12:12; 15:4."""

I know this is not the case everywhere though :( Additionally, I’ve researched and found there is at least one private company offering both nasal swabs (for active virus) and blood tests (for antibody if people want to see if they had an asymptomatic case, but recovered). The cost is about $100, no doctors order needed.... though I respect I’m not allowed to say their name on inspire. I found it on google last week easily, out of curiosity just searching “coronavirus testing” with my city name"
175971864,Thanks _AT_MENTION_

175971872,"I try to live as normally as I can. I work but it's part time. I live in disabled subsidized housing with seniors. Now I'm trying to find love. But worry about the sz reveal. I mean i have red flags divorced 3x, daughter lives with dad, son committed suicide. I don't know, but if they even get past those it's a small miracle. Yet I'm still deciding to be pickier about who I date. But I don't want to end up alone. I just shot down a guy who claimed to be really into me. Even after telling him most stuff. Minus dx but ssd. I wasn't into him, despite him being rich as he said. My thought was all I would care about is your money and he would want a prenup. So I told him not interested in getting involved with someone who wants a prenup. His exwife took some money from him now he's bitter. Anyway, worried about the next guy. Talking with one whose a better match on paper but worried about him knowing my truths. I really like him so far and am really hopeful but concerned."
175971873,"Btw I just woke up fully clothed. That’s how tired I was. I put my work clothes on and then after calling work I went right back to bed with my clothes and shoes on.

175971888,"There have been too many for me. In high school, lunch period was mandatory assembly by interspersed large sections of the student body. It was a public high school, in an inner city. Noise, talking, throwing food, fighting, communication...Hell. As I was placed in advanced classes, I knew the main head of the biology dept. and asked her if I could eat my lunch in her office. She said I wasn't supposed to but allowed me to if I organized some of the stacks of paperwork (as a task used to claim assistance). As head of the dept., she was very busy and was usually out of her office during my lunch period. Her office had a computer (with Tetris), and resembled an old hospital concrete office. It was a quiet refuge where I could read and be alone after organizing the reports. Concerning my academic life, I skipped out of my High School Prom, High School Graduation Ceremony, University B.S. graduation ceremony, and University M.S. graduation ceremony. It was time well spent."

175971892,I wonder if I can get pregnant.
174364094,"No! My Dr was attempting to assist me in getting off EffexorER (20 years usage) I was dropped pretty rapidly, while doing this, I found it counterproductive but, she had me on Seroquel, Wellbutrin, aripiprazole, to assist with the withdrawal. I literally lost my mind! I would drive to the clinic yelling at the front desk staff to tell my Dr that she had to do something or I was going to lose my mind. I’m also on Ativan for anxiety. The Dr places me back on EffexorER added adderall and risperdone to the mix now. I’ve not had any episodes since this one time and she stated that I show bipolar symptoms? I’m just wondering if I should be getting a second opinion or if there’s a chance that I have it and the meds I’m on now are what I needed to balance me out! Thank you for responding!"

175971904,"Feeling weak all over I have suffered with anxiety on and off all of my life but I seem to be going through a particularly bad long lasting episode these past few months. I think a good part of it is due to a Trumatic life style change because I am no longer able to drive due to a serious eyesight condition . Having been independent all my life this is very Trumatic for me and it’s making me feel very isolated. What is happening with my anxiety this time around is a general feeling of weakness all over, almost like I’m going to collapse or something . My legs and lower back feel weak and shaky and I’m terrified I’m going to have a stroke or something. Just wondering if anyone else suffers from this with their anxiety. I love this for him and reach out to it whenever I’m having A lot of anxiety because I always feel that the feedback is better than any counselor out there.

You have suffered abuse twice in your life, and it is going to make a very heavy imprint on you, until it is dealt with. Even though you have handled it all like a real trouper, so far, yet it is seeping into your life story on all sides., and will continue to do so until you get professional help with it. Please don't allow that to happen. The past is the past, and it cannot be undone. But your future is before you, and it needs to be protected from the experiences you have had....as much as is possible. You are a remarkable woman, and have handled it all in a very grown up manner, so now get what you need to help undo the damage it has done.

At least I'm not ravenous all day anymore so the appetite suppressant is helping some. I'd rather not have to try a new med because, other than the munchies, I feel normal on the Zyprexa.

175971989,"That’s interesting. I think that is also partly why some people are drawn to becoming, or become, atheists. I actually had that same experience. Thing with me is, I had to reconnect on a different level. I could see the good things happening to me. Now part of that was me. Part of it was praying, IMO. But I also think prayer is 2 parts. Prayer and action. Like instead of praying “please let me get the money to pay for my medical bills” I went to “please give me the strength to be able to do what I need to do to pay my bills”. This is just an example. And I realized then too, so many people pray for THINGS. And when they don’t get them, they get angry at god. You and god are a team. You work together. He’s not a servant."

174364223,I had psychotic thoughts breaking through again yesterday. I don’t know if it’s work stress or what. I felt better after work. See my doctor today and will mention it. Med adjustment maybe let’s up the abilify see how that goes?
175971993,It’s just annoying how all this happened. I was doing so well and taking my meds and then got set off. I don’t know what we’re going to do. I need to be stable again and the current stuff doesn’t seem to be cutting it.
175971994,Hugs!!!!
175971995,If you need the meds it would be far worse. Still. Talk to your doc. You need to be your own advocate for a l lot of it. You really do.
175971996,It was strange on Tapatalk for a while this morning because they moved the URL or something. I hope that whatever your doc is observing passes soon.
175971997,Work is work. Payday tomorrow! Then it’s the weekend! I’m excited to talk to my psychologist next week. I want to talk about OCD/intrusive thoughts and gender dysphoria. I don’t even know if she even has any experience with gender dysphoria. But I have to talk to someone about it. I’m part of some groups on Facebook and that and they’ve been helpful but like they aren’t professionals. I also talk to my doctor on the 22nd. Just for a check in. Don’t know what I’ll say to him. See how it goes with my psychologist first. Idk how far I want to go with things. We’ll see what happens. Mental health wise I’ve been pretty good. No psychosis. No mood swings really. Some intrusive thoughts and OCD bits and anxiety but otherwise pretty good.
175971998,Beautiful!

175972001,Hi Unsure!
175972002,"In your most recent post, you said, ""I can only hope he is better. I still have the feeling something is not quite right"" and ""It is still a mystery to me how a person can change so much in a matter of two weeks and seem like a completely different person. All I can do now is hope he is doing better"" Which connects to your first post of. ""However, his moods change very quickly - almost every two weeks he is a changed person. He recently told me he might be bipolar II but is not yet diagnosed."" And "" When he broke off the other day he mentioned he might be manic but he is not sure. He is on antidepressants for some months now."" And ""I am super confused and don't know what to do. I will try to see him in some 10 days time and talk with him. I don't know whether he really feels that way or it's his mood acting up."" So, it seems you are wondering what is going on with him. Is his mood change due in whole or part to an emotional disorder, or to his simply changing of feelings. If he has an emo
tional disorder, a correct diagnosis would be needed: (1. depression 2. bipolar I [full mania and depression] or 3. bipolar II [depression but not with full mania]). Then, the correct medicine for that condition could be given so he could become balanced. So, it's a guess of what condition he may have, and what his true feelings might be. It sounds like it is a difficult time for you, as it would be for anybody. So, it's good you reached out for help. The resources of this website, seen at the top of the this bipolar forum, mention the importance of being positive, and it is suggested that you read that. I some years ago had an experience with the importance of being positive when faced with a problem, positive that you can solve it, and thinking positive, before you go into the problem, which will increase your chances of solving it. It did mine. I didn't know it, but unconsciously I was negative, and did not solve very many problems. By thinking positive going into the problem that I could solve this proble
m, also, I increased my chances greatly that I could solve the problem, because my mind was ready for that, not ready for defeat, and unconsciously looking for ways to lose. As you say, ""I am still trying to fight."" That's pretty positive. Post Edited (_NAME_) : 6/18/2019 12:30:40 PM (GMT-6)"

I have so much cleaning to do this week. Like an endless amount. Need to make a list of things and cross them off as I go. Hard to believe it's already almost Thanksgiving.

175972010,"I think this would really help me. I believe genius of ideas comes from a hypnotic state in certain brain waves between wakefulness and sleep. An inventor (I forget his name) used to put a bell on his chair so whenever he'd fall asleep, he'd wake up and write down his ideas. Was it _PERSON_? idk.. I think I'm slipping into a deep depression or it's just a Vyvanse crash."
175972011,"Thanks all for your thoughtful responses. As of yesterday, I am weaning off Chlordiazepoxide. Like before, just making me feel unsteady, anxious, beyond clumsy and generally not feeling well. I have tried so many drugs in order to help with my OCD/GAD/depression and all of them have had worse side effects than benefits (at least in my opinion). Right now, I am through with psychiatry. It's just a bunch of doctors loading you up with various serious drugs until they find (maybe) something that works. And coming offf is a disaster. Guesss I will just need to live with my issues. Thanks again, folks. GG"

175972015,"Ok yeah Idk about two but with one you can push yours of right into psychosis just by doing too much work, even if you’re not really stressed. It’s like it just spirals. I thought people were putting caffeine in my water so I couldn’t sleep. Also sleeping meds so I felt randomly tired in the day."
175972016,Great workout on Beat Saber VR.
175972017,"I just started a new medication. I’ve been tired all day and didn’t do much. I was in bed most of the day. I did take a shower and took my dog for a walk. So I guess I did something. Going to my partial hospitalization program tomorrow. I’ve cried all week there. Talking about how these triggers are making me have panic attacks. I guess I’m glad I just rested today, because tomorrow will be hard emotionally. I hope other people are managing their symptoms. It’s so hard in a time like this."
175972018,"If you have mental illness and have decided to seek treatment for it, working with a psychiatrist and/or a therapist whom you think are the right people for you to be seeing matters. Working with a shrink that you don't think is very good at it is not something I'd recommend. However, if you do start seeing a shrink, I would recommend seeing him or her more than one session before deciding if he/she is the right shrink for you. Years ago, I was seeing a mental health provider. After the first session we had, I wasn't so sure that me continuing to work with him was going to work out for me. But after seeing a couple of more times, I came to realize that he was, in my opinion, very good at what he does, and that he was the right person for me to be seeing. So if you start seeing a shrink, you might want to give him/her more than one session before deciding to stick with him or her or moving on to another provider."
175972019,Idk what time I took my Vyvanse but it should be less than an hour ago. I can't focus. The nicotine helped me to focus before the Vyvanse kicked in. If it has already kicked in then that's a problem...
175972020,"Also, my free book promotion went kinda well. Sold like 25 free books, or 30. (Sucks kinda) but sold some paid ones as well. So that’s good. Not as much tho. But my ranking on amazon is going up. Doing another promotion now as well on insta. I got my obgyn appt next week (not this week). But sold an old (old to me) Xbox for food gift cards. Cuz well we need food. It may seem counter productive to sell my books for free from time to time cuz I need money from them BUT it helps with marketing. Otherwise I wouldn’t sell any paid ones much. That translates to 40 sold so far. Not much at all ah well..."

Could that be the root of your anger?"

175972038,You have good points there. Often with stupid quizzes I re-design the questionnaire and formulate questions I feel are more relevant. Apart from having a question on sarcasm I think another question should have been one that explores how provocative one is especially regarding tone and body language. I think we are all gaining skills on Passive aggressive behavior because 'political correctness' is so over the top now. Hadn't noticed that the word @@@@@@@ does have the prettiest filter.

I don’t read books and people say “if you don’t read books, you don’t read”. Like? I read on the internet. And I’m not talking about fb articles. Like I read literature and opinion pieces. I don’t feel so bad anymore. I mean people read ebooks? Why can’t I read articles and stories and the news online? It’s a screen too. Same as ebooks."

174364277,"If I didn't have my mom, my schizophrenia would have progressed to severe and chronic constant misery I think. And I'd be dealing with police that wouldn't be nice to me because I can't advocate for myself and they aren't really that educated on mental illness. It's getting better though.. I think mental health awareness is gonna get 2-3x better in the next 5 years just based on past predictions. The world is getting better.. I think the next revolution would put all the previous ones in perspective.. Although I feel a bit scared about it and don't want it to be too severe. When overdosed on psilocybin and had like 20 different research chemicals in my pocket, the nurses were opening them at the nursing station saying ""Where did you get this hydromorphone? etc"" and I was laughing and laughing and then started crying.. I felt really bad for having so many schedule 1 chemicals.. One cop was very empathetic and so calm with me. She really calmed me down and didn't charge me for all the chemicals tha
t I had. I was sent to the psych ward the morning after.. My mom wiped the tears from my eyes and then I fell asleep. She stayed with me all night in the hospital room. I saw the cop again last week because she arrived to help clean out the meth room that my moms renter turned into a crack ***** house and I remembered her face. I just had a feeling. I didn't remember any of what has happened. I remember being horribly horribly depressed when I was 16.. I was in the hospital for 6 weeks and they took care of me. I didn't understand and because of the lack of mental health awareness, the cops and nurses didn't understand either.. They just wanted me to be safe and to not kill myself. They brought me food and my mom visited every day after work. I went on my computer with a USB wifi stick and read some books - Including the OCD one by howie mandel, ""Don't look me in the eyes"" and watched the movie ""Beautiful mind"" - Hearing voices when they were at the worst. I would like a day where there's all good cops li
ke the ones I've dealt with. I should have had a criminal record - But I don't. It's amazing. And all the people that do are screwed. It's sad. I feel sorry for the prostitutes and the kids living in that house. I want to cure addiction at least - For people to only do hippie drugs - Take meth as prescribed for narcolepsy. Idk how people get addicted and don't just stop.. But all the communities that are poor, they want to escape from pain - They think a stimulant will lift them up or people addicted to opioids move to Possible trigger: heroin because of Big Pharma. I want to take down Big Pharma. I have my little save the world ambitions like everyone else and the convictions etc.. I don't think cops target black men as bad in Canada as they do in the US - It has to do with something really deep - The government.. and I think more black men have schizophrenia than any other race.. Or latino.. idk.. But imagine not being on meds and the cops don't understand, are racist and want to oppress? But yeah.. the wor

I don’t do much cooking, true, but I’m also busy working full time, studying part time, and dealing with my mental stability. She makes comments all the time like ‘maybe if you cooked more’ or ‘maybe if you cleaned more’. I do what I can. Sometimes I struggle just to do my regular routine. And I don’t see her helping our mother a lot of the time. I didn’t see her doing laundry or cleaning this weekend. She made dinner tonight and cleaned the floor and suddenly I have to bow down to her. I just am getting sick of it."

I remember the basics, such as my name, my address. my age,etc. But, remembering where I put my stuff or a word I'd like to use does not come to me so easily anymore. Is this due to psychosis or is this due to age? I don't know. How does everybody feel about their memory? Is it good still since you've been psychotic? I sometimes just go blank. When I'm really stressed, I really go blank and can't think of things. Why is this?"

175972073,"That does sound bad. You can be glad the food poisoning wasn't worse. My lower back went out a couple of years ago, and it was like on a Thursday, like a 4 day weekend. I was basically homebound at the time, and pretty much now. And since I didn't get out much, I didn't know what to do. I hadn't been to a chiropractor near me in a couple of years, didn't know if the chio I used to go to for that was still in business. I couldn't get there to see for I couldn't drive to see if he was still in business. Being old school, I first thought of information was the yellow pages, not the computer, and went to a phone book which the small print said was out of date, but I didn't see that. I looked up chiropractor and called the one I thought it was I use to go to and that phone number rang but it was out of business. My back is killing me, I am taking too much Aleve for the pain, which is having side affects. Living alone, I don't have anybody I can ask about this. With the pain comes poor decision making. A
nd this is going on for days. I finally get my helper to take me to a new chio, who wants to take x-rays. Oh, gosh. I don't want to take x-rays, so my helper takes me back near my house to my old chio, whose son is now in business, but he's not working that day, and won't be open until Monday, which is 3 more days. This is a nightmare. I sit it out at home, taking pain pills which are not good for me, my back in high level pan, which causes poor decisions. It is a stacking up situation. Several levels. I don't know what to advise but I have an idea of what you are going through. How did you get food poisoning?"
175972074,Mine was way past my waist but it was cut a few weeks ago when they had to untangle some matted hair. I'm ok with it.

The soup kitchen was a great outlet for me to help the less fortunate. I am looking for the right med to help me with my anxiety. Between covid and my health I am just being overwhelmed lately. I do meditate and breath which helps. Sleep also resets me when I am having a bad day. Life is difficult as we age. I am just having a hard time adjusting. Because of my spine my pain spikes at times during the day which causes my mind to go places I do not want to go. Thank you so much Miss _NAME_ for caring and helping me as well as others.

175972125,"Sunflower - Hello... chronic anxiety sucks. I've lived with it for a long time. Aside from going down the medication avenue, there are a couple things I picked up from the frustration of your post. #1. Whether you realize it or not, you are taking the most important step already. You are expressing yourself in a healthy forum here. A. You have recognized there is an anxiety/depression issue to address B. You acknowledge you're not efforting enough keep your body as healthy as you should. C. You already possess some innate understanding that deep breathing could possibly help. #2. You correct on all counts! Kudos, take a bow, force a smile please. A. Figure what is really at the root of this depression that symptomatically expresses itself as anything from an elevated heart rate to loss of appetite to perhaps some fears of loneliness and/or panic attacks. B. Time to going since the going got tough. Do you absolutely NEED to see a therapeutic specialist of some sort and get on medications right away?
?? Personally, I don't think that's the best first answer until you can really look yourself honestly in the mirror after 3 months and say that you you really are trying your best. Can you say that right now? Without any intended offense, it doesn't sound like it at present.... and that's okay too! Ya gotta start somewhere, right? Right!!! Ok then! C. You gotta start forcing yourself to get out more, eat, eat more, and eat healthy. Begin a light exercise regimen in the morning that starts with quietly sitting at peace with yourself and focus on that deep breathing before you do virtually anything! Ok you can brush your teeth, please smile. Now ask yourself, what on God's green Earth would make you think that deep breathing would be an immediate anodyne to your anxiety? Because you're instinctively intelligent, that's why! But In the midst of an anxiety attack, this isn't going to resolve everything all at once. However, what I am getting at here is, is that you're not wrong, nor all that abnormal necessarily, 
or even requiring that much more beyond what you can do for yourself _PERSON_. One should always start with making an effort to love themself more.... Focus on the deep breathing, not a panic induced last resort, but make it part of your routine and do it casually every day, in the morning, at before lunch, and before dinner. Maybe 20 minutes each, that's all. It doesn't have to be some big production. Light exercise I enjoy takes me exploring on walks. Sometimes, I find myself daydreaming in front of a bookstore display, or some architecture, or listening to music or an audio book. You must make the effort to reclaim your lovable you! I love movies so I watch a lot of them. Books and movies are a great way to get out of one's own head and allow your imagination to roam free. I like to write, but I probably don't write as much as I should, so hell, I'm writing to you! This is what doing for you looks like and the rest will come easier regardless of whether you seek out some prescription or therapy. The real a
nswers to your issues are already within you. Sometimes people do need a little extra nudge (myself included), but I still remain a firm believer that the heart of it all rests with not losing faith in yourself. And if you mess up, or forget stuff, or allow yourself to let panic get the best of you... slowly drink a couple glasses of water. Visualize water and yourself breathing calmly, slowly underneath it as if it were air. You got this Sunshine... shine on! ~ cres"

175972135,"The first thing I would ask is: who diagnosed you with Psychosis NOS? A therapist? The same therapist as you had been seeing who refused to keep seeing you? Oftentimes therapists will do things like that. In my experience, I've had several therapists just say, ""Enough is enough,"" and that they can't deal with me anymore. It is a road block but it is not something that worries me that much anymore. Let me explain: I mean, I don't go out seeking for therapists that will end up quitting on me. Rather, I think that some therapists get me and some do not. Of course, it's more nuanced than that. But what I mean is, there are some people out there that are going to act like they cannot deal with your delusions (you do say they are delusions, right?) and some who actually can help you deal with those feelings. It's your task to find the person (or people) who will help you deal with those. Also, it would help to know if that therapist you were seeing is the one who diagnosed you with Psychosis NOS, becau
se that would be helpful to know, as if she did diagnose you with that, and then proceeded to not help you with it, then you should not be that worried about the whole situation. You should just seek out someone who does understand what you're going through. I know it's easier said than done, but that is how I would proceed in your shoes."

175972139,"Hi HW Fam, It's been a while. A long while! I hope you all are doing well and hanging in there as much as you can during these weird, weird times. Our state has announced that shelter-in-place will continue through July 6, so it's looking like another month and a half before any resemblance of 'normal' happens! Just wanted to check in and say hi and get some support from my HW family. I went & bad blood work done for a check up the other day and my WBC were a bit low (3.6) and total proteins were high (8.3). I had a 'zoom' appointment with my doctor who told me she'd like to recheck in a few weeks to see if the numbers went to normal. I asked what abnormal numbers could indicate and she threw out the 'C' word, among others. She said it's likely due to some transient infection/virus that I'm asymptomatic from and that she's seen a lot of patients lately with lower WBC and it could have to do with possibly being exposed to covid somewhere. I wasn't really listening as all I heard was 'malignancy.' Sh
e said the proteins were high likely due to dehydration (this was a fasting blood test), and because I went at 7a, it was due to not drinking enough water. I was also low in Vitamin D, but I'm not as concerned with thatas I live in a state where there's many dark + rainy days. I spoke to my cousin who's an MD and she looked at my blood work and said that the protein level was on the upper limit of normal but didn't really mean anything, but said the WBC is 'most likely low because of a viral infection.' I hate that my head goes to the worst place possible. I hate that for the next couple of weeks my mind will be consumed with the 'what ifs' and fears that go along with health anxiety. It also doesn't help that 6-ish months ago I started a diet that made me lose a ton of weight fast, and have picked trail running through quarantine (and stopped Crossfit/Weight Training abruptly due to gyms being closed) and I'm at my lowest weight. Just need some support & virtual hugs. My spouse is tired of hearing about it."

175972166,"Whilst being subject to this strange and sometimes unnerving experience of what appears to be broadcasting silent speech or subvocalization by technical means, as it's what's been termed as 'Cyber torture ' by the UN as it may use digital EMF or Audio sound files, means to transmit. This would include the 'voices' themselves as they control or shape a malicious narrative to I suppose to suit their own need for power against someone sitting in a room, thinking basically. So, would if proven correct this be in violation of one of the most basic standard human rights, the right to privacy, contemplating thoughts, or just living basically as a right not to be tortured or subject to degrading treatment within your own home or indeed harassed or live streamed within written consent. I've noticed they are more active with regards to themes, you'll notice patterns in which they will be more apparently responsive too. You can also, notice the volume of the conversation and in some cases, I've even heard my 
own thoughts being broadcasted back out loud as at times you can hear the echo or last part of the conversation being played as though through a speaker. So, in short, would this be a serious as revenge porn if proven true or a real event taking place clandestinely without the victim's consent or even awareness. Even the fact that these are being regarded by the UN as real strikes me a strange in the first place, as there are many genuine platforms like MobbedUK or Flyingmonkies denied.

I am a 20 year old male with a history of atypical depression and social anxiety but my treatment so far has been limited. The only medication I'm occasionally taking a small dose of insidon to help me sleep. So much regarding the general situation. The reason why I'm here: I have been experiencing some really freaky things and I don't know what the hell they are and what's going on with me. The are basically ""apparitions"", sort of demon like humanoid creatures that are lurking in my room staring at me. I know they are not real, I know they are not there, and I can't even actually SEE them. I just FEEL like I can see them. It's like for example I'm sitting at my desk and I get this feeling that there's someone or something in the room with me and I can exactly describe what that being looks like even though I can't see it. And I know that if I would turn around nothing would be there. Wh
ile at the same time I am like paralysed and too terrified to turn around and check. I don't know what the hell is going on. I'm scared that this might be a sign of something like psychosis but if I were psychotic I wouldn't be aware of the fact that these things aren't real, right? I don't know an awful lot about psychosis so I don't know if that's actually true or a misconception. Additionally, I am aware that demon like creature have a certain religious connotation but I was raised in an atheist household and have no religious belief, so it's nothing like that either. Please, if someone knows what is going on with my brain, please tell me. I'm freaking out."

(We've got the DVDs.) She and I have a regular date to get together on Fridays and we always have a good time. Right now most of my social life is with family, but I've been thinking of joining a social Meet Up group for singles over 50 in my city--there is a big one here. I had a good session with my T yesterday and it helped me begin to process the death of my friend. Possible trigger: I've been feeling stuck because I never believed _PERSON_ would go through with suicide; she was always trying to get attention when she harmed herself in the past or made threats about harming herself. My T thinks her suicide was accidental, that it was another cry for help and they just weren't able to revive her this time. And I know that _PERSON_ hadn't lost the things she was passionate about so she had a lot to live for. Somehow, knowing 
it was an accident makes it easier to start to process. Today will be a lazy day--I slept in, finished a book, will probably watch some Orange is the New Black, start another book, etc. Saturday-type stuff. Hang in there everybody Hugs, Ceara"

175972196,"The mountain air is so refreshing. This is the first time that I can actually smell the mountains and maybe pine trees. I can't believe where I live. It's just my screwed up life. I would be much happier as an animal.. Just worrying about predators, food, sex, sleep, water, air, nature.. But a human can understand the universe. Which is basically what I want. To look for deeper meaning spiritually and understand scientifically. Humans have flaws. And everyone's arguing and being fools. No one does that here. I was lost in hedonia seeking. Now I seek experience, feeling a little hedonia here and there.. The anhedonia is much better. It's what I was mainly complaining of to my doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists. I just want peace. I've had too much fun and pain. But we get it all. We don't really control what happens. That's a really beautiful thing about this stuff."
175972197,I feel sad organizing notes alone I'm not a real INTJ
175972198,"I’m taking 75 mg at lunchtime and 25 mg in the evening. Doc suggested that. I had been waking too early but since I began taking the last 25 mg later (9pm), I’ve been sleeping better. But even after a full nights sleep, I’m tired when I wake up. Need some coffee to function. So be it."
175972199,"Believe me I am trying to do my best, Since I started to saw the situation, I had tried to understand, and that is way I ended here, asking you guys and trying to understand what is going on with my hubby, definitely is hard for him to understand me and the same hard for me to understand him, I try to listen but we don’t listen the same thing, sadly."
175972200,Same. I don’t ever say that to anyone but same.
175972201,"_AT_MENTION_....that's a tough one. I'm sorry you are so tired from the meds. It's hard once your sleep gets messed up to get it back to where you want it. It's encouraging that you have slept during the night the past three nights! That's a good step. I'm sorry that _PERSON_ was frustrated with your sleep. I'm sure he isn't frustrated with you. Just that you know, you aren't feeling the best and having to sleep. It's probably frustrating to you too. I know you want kids and I think you will make a great Mom. May be that your meds needs some tweaking or something like that. I don't really know for sure but if you were doing better on the 1.5 mg of Vraylar maybe you could go back to that if your doctor says it is okay. How are you psychosis symptoms? Plus it is going from Summer to Winter which makes us all go a bit into hibernation mode. I know it does for me. That may have something to do with it too. I'm sorry you are struggling. Wish there was more I could do. Sending you big hugs, _PERSON_"

175972204,"My mom's friend on the hike today told us that she started taking escitalopram (Lexapro) and said she was dealing with brain fog. She was talking about years and dates and said ""I'm good at math.. Idk why I can't think"". It's the same thing that escitalopram did to me. I stopped Prozac (Fluoxetine) two years ago because I couldn't listen to podcasts anymore. SSRI's are terrible for ADD/ADHD I think... I'm not on an SSRI - I just deal with mild depression and self medicate with phenibut (Which makes my depression way worse during withdrawal to the point of suicidal thoughts and I don't even realize it) - But then I still benefit from it 40% of the time.. I just figure that the mushroom overdoses were enough. I saw an episode today on Dr. _NAME_ cuz my mom was like ""Come watch the TV"" cuz a woman with bipolar was manic on the show and said that she was ""microdosing mushrooms"" and ""used to overdose on them"". Don't take them with bipolar/schiz bad idea."
175972205,I already told my therapist about the OCD and trauma so I'm gonna make an appointment over the phone to speak with her about it.

Thing I learned is, if you eat healthy, your food items are very small in calorie amounts. So you can eat a big meal of healthy dishes."
175972212,"For the last two days I’ve been feeling this weird _PERSON_ , zap, Jolt in upper sternum. Have any of you felt this ?"
175972213,Yeah hopefully I sleep well. I don’t really feel tired yet. I’ll put my phone down in a bit and try to sleep. I hope you’re able to get your depression under control.

I'm actually taking a different antihistamine because the Benadryl doesn't do anything for me. Seroquil is no longer working ofr me either, nor is my benzo Restoril.

175972219,Today I have stuck to what my doctor has prescribed for me so far. I am thinking about missing class today since I am kind of feeling a little off. I don't know if I should or not. The director of my program said I could miss today if necessary. I think I may miss today.
175972220,I have to agree with everything going on today the world will never be the same. On top of the virus the US seems to be at war with most other countries. Our allies of years past are now shunning us. I think the present administration has much to do with this situation. I hate feeling in the world we live in now we cannot count on our past allies in the event of a war. The US is becoming more isolated each day. The posturing of the US and China will eventually end in a confrontation. I am sorry for this message it just seems such a morbid time for us all. On the virus Homefront it does seem we may be making great strides in developing a vaccine. Now we are accusing China of stealing all our information. We know China does this so why we don't take better care to prevent the theft is beyond me. God bless the us all

175972254,not today.
175972255,"Hi _NAME_, As I read your post it seems your confusion comes from being pulled to make your parents happy vs. making yourself happy. Sounds like your torn, so torn that your giving up your dreams and picking a career that your parents will be happy with and you are just “okay” with. You said “personally its not what you want to do” (to be a nurse) so I don’t think becoming a nurse is what you should do. I like your dream of going away to school in Rhode Island! It sounds like a great plan, but because of friends and family, you decided not to follow your heart and what would make you happy. I know how you feel. Most of my life I made choices that would make my parents proud of me. Not that I wanted to do those things, and as I got older I found myself in a never ending feeling of being afraid I was going to disappoint others when I made decisions, keeping myself from following my dreams. Something that really helped me was to ask myself “What am I pretending NOT to know?” Listen to yo
ur heart, what makes you get that excited feeling inside. That is where your heart is. That is the direction you should go. Talk to your parents and tell them how you feel. You don’t want to disappoint them, your want them to be proud of you. And if you following what your passions is (helping people) they will be proud of you. There are many different careers that help people, so don’t limit yourself to being a nurse. Explore your options. I really wish the best for you. And I hope that I helped you....I like to help people too!!!!"
175972256,Oh no!

175972259,I forgot to refill my prescription for my Lexapro so I haven’t taken it today or yesterday. I had some weird negative dreams and I’ve felt a bit dissociated all day. I should be fine to do my exam tomorrow but I’ll have to go get a refill soon. I keep forgetting to fill out this pharmacare paper my insurance wanted me to fill out so I’ll have to pay out of pocket again this month. Sucks but at least I’ll be able to claim it on my taxes next year. It’s like $20 or so not too bad.

The judge was mad at the social worker on our case because it took 9 months to get the dv assessment for the parents. They got their marijuana card... kept the house clean for the most part. did a psychological evaluation... drug test only came positive for marijuana. In counseling, have a case manager and a psych doctor that sees all of us. They bring food pantries to us every week or so. They helped up a lot. Down stairs is basically my room with my 58 inch tv and plan on sharing the tv with the kids... we have Disney Plus for the kid. The kids will take the bigger room. Inspection was good and was glad how far we came a long in the house. I've been very anxious on the stuff that was going on. Keeping up with what to do... using my phone to help get reminders on calling and seeing if they have to drop that day. drug test is spontaneous on weather you got to go or not. I saw the kids the firs

They cried when we had to leave. lol one of them broke the glass on the frame of a picture I did for him and he cried because he broke it.

But no amount of pain changes me. My mom is this same way. She's an optimist no matter what happens to her. She always sees the bright side of things. In depression, I used humour.. I still do.

Gonna throw away the old, torn, stained stuff, and gonna wear this stuff again. I always choose extremely unique clothes. And this is like a snapshot into when i was sick. Very interesting. The clothes are sizes 5 in pants and small and medium shirts. Which is crazy. Cuz I thought I was fat then, after high school, because in high school I was size 00. Yes, double zero. Then when I got sick the meds ballooned me to size 5 and I just kept going up. I'm size 15 now at least. 15 or 18 pants. Probably 15 now since I lost some weight. I know if I lose weight now and go back to 120 or 130, I vow very seriously I will try my best to keep weight off. I used to say I'd do anything, but I wouldnt. I wouldnt exercise to lose weight. I'd go about my normal routine. But I FOR SURE, wouldnt be eating the shyt I do now. I'll eat much, much healthier. I hate my 
body as of right now, so, so, so much."

175972291,"I'm so sorry you're stressing so much through all of this, and COVID certainly doesn't help. Perhaps a back office sales position might be more suited to you? Like car dealerships have openings for Internet sales for people who send inquiries about cars and financing? Or in construction supply stores, they have front desk sales and back office/warehouse sales where you would pull the orders for the customers instead of dealing with them directly. Maybe that is something you would be interested in. As far as the anxiety, I hope you are seeking some kind of treatment or therapy for it because as you know, if you don't, you could land the perfect job for you, but if your anxiety is untreated, it won't matter and you'll be back in the same place, if not worse. Doing little things like looking for jobs as I mentioned, taking some time to exercise, even if it's for a walk around the block, setting a schedule for yourself can help you feel a measure of control. And for things that you cannot control such 
as customers, COVID, career advancement, please remember this saying from _NAME_ 6:34 So never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles. Or as my mom likes to say, don't go borrowing trouble. Take each day at a time and try not to waste your energy on things that may never happen tomorrow or in the future. That robs you of peace in the present. I hope you are able to find something and to treat your anxiety and that everything will be alright soon. Best wishes."

Oh well. It's over now. Anyway, yeah, I've learned not to listen to people like that. Only people I really trust mental-health wise are people on PC, my doctors, and sometimes my parents. Sometimes friends are helpful. I just wish that it wasn't so hard to give good advice or real support on mental health stuff. It's super frustrating. Well, that's why I need therapy, I suppose."

Most of my coworkers have no idea that I hallucinate, or that I was in a psych hospital or that my arms are full of scars. I wear long sleeves to work every day summer or winter. Some have asked me about it because it gets hot here, I just say I have a skin condition. I don't feel like that is a lie. It's just not the total truth."

I love reading all the posts... I wish America would open up a bit more about mental issues and I wish it was a bit easier to talk more openly.. when I feel safe I do open up to my friends.. the close ones. But we all do not want to be judged and therefore, hold back quite a bit. It is freeing to be able to speak and be heard and seen.... Thank you"

175972333,"Hi Everyone, I would like to help if I can. I have degenerative disc disease and have had spinal fusion with discs taken out and metal hardware put in. I have taken Gabapentin in the past so here is my take on this med. It works well for nerve pain which is what I am left with after surgery. I still have more levels which need to be fused and will get this done after my cancer surgery I hope. Gabapentin is used off label for anxiety/depression. Now for how it worked for me. When I first start taking this med it definitely takes the edge off my anxiety. I was on a baby dose of 3 capsules per day. Each has 100mg. My dr then increased this to 2 capsules 3 times per day. No side effects which are horrible. You will feel a bit tired and your cognitive abilities are slowed quite a bit. It does a good job of ending my anxiety periods. The bad news is the longer I take it the less effective it is for anxiety. If you come off it for a month then start over it works great, at least it did for me. I am happy 
to answer any questions. I hope this helps anyone thinking of taking this med. I am of course not a dr and this is just my personal experience. God bless us all."
175972334,"I laid down on the floor of my office, which unfortunately is tile. I was just feeling tired and wanted to lay down.

175972335,I just need to rest right now. Everyone loves me and says I'm a great person and good etc etc .. But it's because I've been working so hard on myself. Remember me? Snorting meth off of private parts of people? I go to not giving a **** to completely hard on myself. I need to find balance and I think playing video games would help me really relax.

For the past 5 days I’ve had this horrible cough/chest cold. of course my anxiety is in full force thinking it’s something terrible and life threatening. I went to urgent care to have assurance my lungs were clear and she said everything sounded very clear and it was just going to have to run it’s viral course. She gave me pills as a cough suppressant but reading about them they numb your throat and chest area and lord knows that would send me into much worse anxiety then they are worth. Ugh, my anxiety has been such a struggle lately, does anyone else notice it runs rampid when your sick? I’m so frustrated. My eyes seem to be effected this time; in that I mean I’m very aware for some reason or another that there’s congestion in my head and chest and it’s literally making me feel crazy and anxious and I try of course to not make it obvious so I blame a headache and go in the other room and calm myself down.

175972356,"I see my psychiatrist in 2 weeks (He's the emergency psychiatrist that I saw last summer when I was hospitalized for dissociative panic attacks/psychedelic flashbacks). He's the one that prescribed the 10mg olanzepine which killed my panic attacks so I'm not dependent on benzos anymore. He sees me every 3 months to check up on me. When I saw him 6 months ago, he said that I was having disturbing thoughts and ""religious psychosis"" but all of that is gone now. During the last appointment, he said that he wants to help with my motivation so I'll talk to him about that when I see him. I'm not really sure what to do about it. He said that I could take 1-2 5mg's of Dexedrine if the Vyvanse isn't enough. But other than that, I'm fine.. I see my doctor this week for a Vyvanse refill so I'll let him know these things as well. I might want to lower the Invega injection to a medium dose because I seem to be sleeping a lot like 12-14 hours a night."
175972357,"""Mental illness is a main cause of lack of self-awareness, however it is nearly impossible for a functioning human being to survive without some type of awareness over its environment and behavior. Some reasons for lack of self-awareness may be: -Impulsiveness: Not recognizing the consequences of one’s actions and continuing to behave in the same manner over and over again. -Lack of Morals: Ethics are not prioritized therefore one chooses not to do anything about it even if it is detrimental. -Lack of Consciousness: No desire/will/drive to expand one’s thinking or perception of world around them. -Lack of connection with Emotions: One cannot sympathize with oneself or others around them. -Isolation: Little to no communication with other human beings leads to little understanding of how to fit in with social constructs/beliefs/trends. -Underdeveloped Understanding of Behavior: If one has not taken the time to get to know oneself, they will not know why they do the things they do."""

175972378,"Hi All, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a very serious issue for all age individuals. In the process of survival, humans tend to let go of the mental bruises they have experienced because of several unwanted incidents in their lives. This let go works for a few , however many keep this mental or physical stain within themselves and fall trap to the bigger issues of depression and anxiety in the longer run. PTSD is not something that happens overnight or because of an immediate or recent experience. We all tend to burden all the abuse and _USER_ID_ within ourselves and tend to unknowingly move ourselves into the realm of depression. PTSD till date is still a grey area where the diagnosis and treatment is still not clear. The Internet will reflect upon many treatments however there isn't much knowledge amongst the masses as to which would be an effective one on the specific individual. Also Quarterly and yearly treatment courses are not easily affordable by all. The needy ones who actually are the 
main victims of PTSD, **Can they actually afford them? Do they actually know whether they have PTSD or not?** Anyone can help on the treatment types on PTSD which is in real effective as well as affordable?"

I was treated for sz then but later when i was in my 40s a doctor softened and said he thought it might be schizoaffective, regardless of the label i have delusions and hallucinations seems like the label doesn't change that."

I think it's better for akathisia than Propranolol, although I looked it up and it can occasionally worsen psychosis (that hasn't happened to me, and I've never heard of it happening). I'm on it, and it's helped a lot with the akathisia and I don't get any side effects from it. As for your actual symptoms, you just gotta keep with the program of trial-and-error when it comes to finding the right meds. In the mean time it might be good to do some therapy to work on coping skills and grounding techniques to deal with your symptoms in the mean time. It can take a while so you just need to be patient with the doctors."

175972417,"This is like watching a yo-yo, sometimes it's up and sometimes it's down. Which happens to everybody, I think. You said: ""At first I was cold and replied with very short messages. Then I said I will think about it and if I have some time I will text him to hang out (his words: hang out). Yesterday evening I contacted him and asked very warmly of his plans on that particular day, with the idea to meet him. He still hasn't replied although he was online. ""And that's it. I don't think I can take this behavior anymore. Even if he replies I probably won't agree to meet him or whatever. ""I hope this story can help someone, as the numerous cases I read online have somehow helped me."" That last sentence really tells the story. I went to a website one time fully expecting to spill my guts over a big issue, and I got to reading some of the other problems, and mine seemed to disappear. And by trying to help others, I reversed the energy flow, from going in toward my problems to going out to other people's 
problems. . I have as many problems, I just spend more times thinking about other people's problems rather than dwelling on my own, thinks in large part to this website. But I still have crisis and think it's very good to reach out for help from others if anybody is around and through websites such as this if there are not. I also chastise myself when I don't solve a problem for not having been able to figure it out myself. Or as somebody once said, """"I hope this story can help someone, as the numerous cases I read online have somehow helped me."" Post Edited (_NAME_) : 8/10/2019 11:35:51 AM (GMT-6)"

174364734,"That's by far one of the most horrible things that can happen in reality. I'm sorry you went through that. I don't think my dissociation is that bad. It happened with my last dose of ketamine though. Drugs are really bad for my mental health I've noticed. I'm going to stay away from them permanently because if I ever trip again, I'm sure I'd go completely psychotic forever. I remember in the hospital there was this guy with schizophrenia.. It was the worst schizophrenia that the hospital therapist said he's seen. I talked to him and he asked me if I did LSD or shrooms and I said yes and I asked him the same question. He said yes. Maybe he did them too many times or took too much. Then he just walked away because he lost focus and started spinning around in circles like he always did.."

175972424,"I am so sorry for your loss. I, myself lost a baby 20 years ago and I still think about her every day. And I developed an anxiety disorder as a result. One of the things that helped me was joining a support group. It means so much to be with people who understand what you are going through. Perhaps instead of thinking of ending your life, you can celebrate his life and give it more meaning. For example, many people collect money to build playgroups or park benches or even plant a tree in their child’s name. I write poetry and stories about my baby and if it helps only one person, it will have given my daughters life more meaning. You may feel like you are not strong enough, but you will be. If you spend time preserving his memory and goodness, it will add goodness to your life."

I mean I’m pretty sure it’s legit because I researched the company, many articles on them, and stuff, and it’s just a tier system streaming job. Not a pyramid scheme but you get bonus money from making “diamonds” in the live stream from viewers. But that’s all whose involved. It doesn’t involve like recruiting people or anything. Idk maybe it is a pyramid scheme but it’s it’s with the developers of the streaming app, which I’ve streamed on before a few years ago."
175972429,"I watched ""You're Not You"" this weekend on Amazon Prime. It was super sad. I cried so much I gave myself a migraine. It's about a woman with ALS and her caregiver. The friend I watched it with has Parkinson's and she really likes that movie for some reason."

175972431,"For me the anxiety seemed to stem from the uncertainty of my future, and lack of confidence this brings. Again, health issues were at the root of my distress/anxiety as it puts so many question marks into your life....how much can I work, what activities will I have to forego that I love doing, etc. I found that once I got relief from the medication (in my case adderall for the fatigue, zoloft for the vestibular issues) things seemed to build. I gained some reassurance that things would not be as bad as I thought they would be, a baseline that I could count on in regard to functioning (socially this was huge, I could still do things I loved, just not to the same extent). Mentally the doubt about my life and what I could do/not do started to fade. Sure, I get jolted from life when things happen (like taking antibiotics and being affected negatively) but I have to remember I made it through other darker situations and came out ok. Therefore I can do it again. Hope this perspective helps!"

174364744,Ok so guys.. This is phenibut induced bipolar. I'll have to write self affirmations and stuff about myself while feeling great before I run out of the supplement... Because I was so down today from not taking it.. It's horrible.. I can see how bipolar is so horrible. There's nothing else that I've ever taken that affects my mood this much. If only there was a medication like this. It's manageable. It's not like instability but just a relief from depression. There is a medication called baclofen (Chlorinated phenibut) but it builds tolerance. They're working on GABA type medications for schizophrenia negative symptoms.

Went to Church, did some errands, visited a friend. I think I did something to my knee--twisted it or something. It's been hurting for a couple of days but today seems a little better. I'm depressed.

175972445,"It sounds like you're on three good medicines. 1. The net says Lexapro is for depression and anxiety 2. Buspar is for anxiety 3. Klonopin net says is for panic disorders Has that been holding you of late? When is you next appointment? I have some chest problems, also. If my chest hurts, I can take an Ativan tranquilizer and it calms it down and makes the pain go away. If I feel I don't need the Ativan, I can put a heating pad on my chest which expands the blood vessels and brings more oxygen and nutrients to the injured area and often reduces my pain. The Emergency Room can help you if you need it with either of these two things."

However, if you feel that you are unstable too much and too often, even though you're on pills, then it may be time for an increase in dosage of the medication(s) you are currently on. Or you may need to be put on new pill(s) altogether."

175972478,took my morning
175972479,"i have been hearing voices almost everyday sense 1971. I wish there was a great answer to your question but i will tell you some of the things that over time i have used. when they first started i talked back to them but early on they weren't that threatening. Mostly making me do dumb things like riding my bike down to a local villiage to cut down a small scotch pine tree to bring home to have a christmas tree in my room. I did this in the middle of the night if i would have been old enough to think the whole thing thru i wouldn't have drug the tree thru the house and up the stairs without wrapping it in a sheet, my mother yelled up the stairs the next morning you better get that tree out of this house. Ha i decorated it and it was epic. Ok back to how to handle them, the got more serious around say 1982 when they would use harsh meds at high strengths. During that time i used weird but useful coping strategies , i would go into myself and try to understand them, try to become one with them. I gues
s befriend them. Due to that strategy i became catatonic at times and it ended me up in the state hospital for 6 months. Today i just let them wash over me not take over me like back then. But you have to understand back in the 80s treatment of the mentally ill was far harsher than today. Straight jackets , 5 point restraints and heavy chemical restraints were used regularly and sometimes for no apparent reason. So the catatonia was used by me to survive. For 47 years I have lived with this and it is my normal, I find it sweet that my current medical team really thinks we can change this from my normal to a new normal. After awhile with voices or other hallucinations it gets to be what you know and you don't fight it so hard, the days were its silent or clear i get nervous that something is wrong so i guess they have become part of what is me. I'm sorry i didn't give you much to hold onto but roll with the voices remember they are just voices they can't hurt you make sure they know you make the choices and wo
n't be controlled by them. Tell them you are the BOSS! warmest regards, tams you can ask me anything, if i can help you i'd be honored."

175972487,"Anyone experience relationship anxiety? I'm in my late 30s and this is something I have dealt with for as long as I can remember. I had SEVERE separation issues from my mom as a kid. I read a lot about attachment and I believe I have anxious-avoidant which is a combo of both anxious and avoidant. Almost like ""come here, get away from me"".. is the best way to describe it. I am a very intuitive person and always trust my gut. With the new guy I am seeing I don't believe it is my gut. I believe it is anxiety. I tend to nitpick once I start to like someone and the stuff I nitpick about is so not even important. I think once I get close to someone, I subconsciously turn off as a defense or way to not get hurt or abandoned. I have a fear of loss. I am so aware of my issues and right now I see no red flags in the person I am dating. We have been seeing each other a month and it is early but... he has been the sweetest, most validating man and we just click. Things have felt right ( when I'm not nitpicki
ng and anxious). Yesterday I had a therapy session with my therapist who is a marriage and family therapist. She wanted to challenge my anxiety and asked me... do you feel great in your heart or in your head ? I immediately had a wave of anxiety and started doubting whether I even like this person or care. Meanwhile, before this question, I was happy and talking about how the relationship with this guy feels so different and real unlike other relationships, and how part of me has felt like this may be someone I see as ""the one"" . I like this guy and see so much potential, and vice versa because he has told me. I don't want to sabotage anything. But today my anxiety is so debilitating that I feel like I need to run. I know it will never get me where I want if I run.. marriage and kids etc.. and the most frustrating part is that the way I have been feeling I have no reason to run. This anxiety and feeling is taking over. Please help!"

She told me, you had an MRI a year ago and a mammogram 4.5 months ago and they were negative ,etc. I didn't have time to wait and do an ultrasound because I had to pick up my kids from school. She told me give it a few weeks if its still there we can do an ultrasound. Well it went away for about a week but its back again. These pulsations straight into my nipple, they are kind of painful.

175972510,"So I had an interesting day. Scrolling Zillow this morning trying to get a ballpark value of FIL’s house and husband asks me to check houses in the next town over. Well up pops like my dream home. Within budget, almost 12 acres, fenced acre just for dogs , everything I need in my life. Husband asks if I’d consider selling my home and moving. I didn’t burst into tears. So I figured that was a sign. Contacted agent, asked all my ?s, set up a tour. Specifically asked if there was a basement. 2 agents said yes. Get there and walk the grounds a bit and then BAM there it is... It’s sitting on a damn slab. Complete and deal breaker for my husband. So...dreams crushed. But I guess I’m considering moving Only to 1 town though and there are only 12 houses for sale there."
175972511,Definitely ideal to be on the lowest possible dose. I'm having adverse effects from zyprexa and depakote and my old pdoc wouldn't let me lower the dose out of fear of my symptoms returning.

Only 30 day assignment and like 14 posts for 140. Stuff like that sounds easy to just post social media but it’s not. Especially what most of these contracts are asking for. Like you have to make a video saying very specific keywords but in your own words. The contract isn’t what’s complicated most times, it’s the actual assignment. I’d do it if it was at least 250 but idk. Also applied to a writing site that seems pretty strict but supposedly is one of the higher paying content panels. It’s really not strict, I just think it is because they ask to cite sources for work. I know good and well how to and why I should, it’s just a pain. But it’s work, right? Even writing can be dull sometimes."

174364878,"But you can speak your mind, right? Because, if you cannot, you really, really need a new doctor. My pdoc is a toal genius in my opinion, but he always begins every potential med change by giving a lengthy explanation of his thinking. Then he stops and always, always says: :""But, does this sound at all interesting to you? Do you think you might want to try something like this?"" Or words to that effect. He cares deeply what I think, even though all I really know a lot about is antidepressants. I know little about APs and mood stabilizers. Very little. Gotta gotta gotta tell your truth , Asparagae. It is the only way. Hugs!!!!!!!"

I'm sure I have, but I can't think of any examples.

175972542,"My panic attacks are officially gone! I had a good day today. Woke up.. took a thc gummy, then had a shower.. took a low dose psych, chilled and started reading a book in the sun although it was too hot and I didn't do much reading.. 3 smokers were offering me smokes so I was smoking those.. drinking sangria and beer.. But I was taking such low doses of everything that I was pretty sober the whole day.. I walked to the gas station and bought an energy drink.. drank that.. went back and my moms friend from my old town (In the middle of nowhere) and her daughter (My sisters friend) arrived. We chatted a little then my mom came home from work and started drinking wine. I forgot about the fact that my mom could drink too much wine with her bf and she asked for her beta blocker (Heart med) so I brought her a glass of water with it and told her to drink just water so she was pretty good about that for the day. My sister and her two friends from the old town (The other friend moved here to work) and her b
f started playing music and playing beer darts. She ordered alcohol after we drove to the liquor store to get alcohol. She's underaged so my mom told me to bring my ID. We went to 3 liquor stores. Then they were gonna go in the hot tub but the hotel owner threatened to call the cops so we came back. My moms friend with bipolar is so sweet. She thinks she's fat even though she's skinny and thinks she's ugly but she's not and has a new bf and he says nice things about her so she was all giddy so he picked her up and they went for a drive. My mom was complaining about having to work tomorrow as a hotel manager and it's really stressful so she went to bed. I felt sorry for her so I put on my earbuds to listen to music and cleaned the horrible complete mess in the kitchen. It took me an hour to clean up and clean the dishes. She walked into the kitchen and gave me a hug because of it. Poor thing.. I believe the motivation came from all the drugs and meds that I take in conservative dosing. Like nothing crazy about 
it like when I was a mess and needed to be hospitalized carrying 10-15 types of different drugs in my pocket. Some of them which I stole. So things are good. Tomorrow is Sunday so I suppose I'll sleep in then do some things in town on Monday and then look for a job on Tuesday. I'll have to sign up for september college courses soon. So I'm doing good. Sorry for the long post and if it's boring. I'm just doing good mostly because my panic attacks are gone which is the last mental problem that I've solved other than depression and psychosis. I've noticed that I can never be manic because of my modesty. I'm extremely modest. Like I know moving to _NAME_ has been really good for me. More than good.. But I'm like ""whatever"" and don't notice. My moms friend from the old town was talking to my mom and saying good things about me like how I talk more and I have like.. idk, in other words, more of a personality like I'm more social because I'm not depressed anymore. Although I get really sad sometimes but it doesn't 
last long. Good night all =] Hope ye'r all able to sleep ^^ #ManicPost"

174364912,"My pdoc and I go back and forth about whether or not I have bipolar 1 or SZA. I have had some pretty intense periods of psychosis - sometimes at home, sometimes in public- intrusive thoughts, delusions, hallucinations, overwhelming feelings of ""too much"", etc. All of these things combine to make an experience not unlike what is shown in the 2nd and 3rd videos in this YouTube video BEFORE YOU CLICK ON IT, let me just put up a big TRIGGER WARNING! At least, it was triggering to me. I've had episodes a lot like what are shown here. The paranoia, the intrusive thoughts, the hallucinations, command voices, feeling overwhelmed by my environment... After seeing this, I'm pretty sure I have schizoaffective Disorder. I still have depression and mania, to be sure. But this video clicked with me."

175972551,"My husband, _NAME_ is prescribed Xanax 0.5mg/twice daily (Qty: 60 tabs per month) and has been for over 6 years now. He has monthly psychiatry appointments in order to get refill of the Xanax as well as Adderall 30mg/twice daily (Qty: 60 instant release tabs per month). At first he really wasn’t thrilled at the thought of being on “these” medications considering their high potential for addiction/abuse. His doctor convinced him that in combination, the two meds would “balance each other out” and leave him in a laidback yet extremely focused state which per his doctor, was where he needed to be ...how he needed to behave, I guess. He was extremely responsible and immediately responsive positively within 1.5-2 weeks of beginning medications daily. He felt calmer, driven, purposeful and more than anything...he actually felt normal for once. It was great. Now, 6 years later (72 months - approx. 2,160 days - and 144 combined prescript ions of Xanax and Adderall)...it’s now definitely causing 
more bad than good. Yes, it helps his anxiety and ADHD issues. Yes, he feels great and that makes me happy for him but...4 days of the 30 day month he is living on top of his world in a xanaxed trance and the other 26 days he is actively and consistently searching for them from other ppl, which ends up being extremely costly. I guess, I want to know if anyone has any POSITIVE suggestions and/or similar experiences to this? He takes his Adderall as prescribed. It’s never been an issue for him with that med. only the Xanax. Rather than him stop taking them cold turkey, which could cause a scary variety of side effects including seizures, are there any anxiety meds his doctor and him could consider as a safer, yet similar, alternative? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you."

174364930,"Hi all. Yes the mania.... However bi polar is best managed in three ways. First, the right meds....typically anti deoressants are useless unless in combo with a mood stabiliser and last a psychiatrist skilled in this disorder. Self compassion is crucial as is understanding and ya spot on here. I have had 3- 3 plus months hospitalizations and a dozen shorter every med on the planet including ECT. I am stable....mostly. The _USER_ID_ only lessens via educating the ignorant...something i am keenly involved in from a lived experience role with key stake holders. I utilise a bi polar support service also and am involved in a genetic study of bi polar. It is all about as posted caring understansing compassion and about us educating the masses. Bar borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia it is the most complex beast. Was dx with borderline and briefly at one time a episodic period of schizophrenia. Keep being strong and have accountability for ones self...this is imperative. Learn the warning si
gns and triggers...an action olan can and usually will eliminate a crisis that is brewing. Asking for help is a sign of strength....big time. We got to be proactive. Many healing thoughts. HT Post Edited (theHTreturns...) : 9/6/2019 2:54:15 AM (GMT-6)"

175972555,"hey all! i went to lunch with my Peer support person, Heather, she and I go out every 2 weeks and talk about what is going on in my life. It went pretty good till i went to get out of the car when we got to my house. I looked at her and all the sudden her whole face was covered in blood, i had to get out of there. Once i got inside and calmed down i was sure she was ok but i called my case manager he shares an office with her and he had her call me back when she got back to the office and assured me she was fine. It really shook me up. I'm cool now tho, crisis passed!"

Otherwise I can set 15 alarms on max volume and sleep through them all. Key is to not lay back down afterward. Stay up, maybe take a walk outside, get a cup of coffee, take a shower"

175972560,"It's good that you wrote in. You said, ""Had it for few weeks now but since ive been on holiday which is now 10days I have experienced it more and its got stronger and longer. "" You know not getting out can get to anybody. And perhaps if we have anxiety, I have bipolar so I know what that is, it might add another layer to the problem of isolation, not working, etc. So that the problem might come out in a physical form, as our mind tries to help us, and maybe signal to us that we are having some problems. Maybe it's telling us, hey, this is getting too much for just the mind to handle. As in, maybe we need some more help here. You know, just sitting in the corner is not getting it. Whatever we've been doing needs to change. Our body and mind are both crying out for help. That's where we come in. So I guess if we could get out, maybe work will start back to get some mental relief so that this stress/anxiety is not so bad that it comes out in a physical form. If you can get out that might help, get i
n contact with others, including people on this board. If you have a psychiatrist that might be good. You've contacted the anxiety forum, have you had problems with anxiety? The ice on the arm that helped sounds great. My chiropractor said ice on my injured lower back will help, and it did. I would keep going with the ice, which he said reduced inflammation. He also said a heating pad helps by rushing oxygen and nutrients to the injured area. Do you have a heating pad? Moist heat helps me even better (by moistening the insert or a small kitchen towel and wringing it out. He wanted me to separate the ice treatment and the heat by 15-30 minutes, probably. Multi treatment such as ice/heating pad, getting out, psychiatrist, good attitude that we can get through this, might improve our chances."

174364933,Talked to my Pdoc just now... She increased my cogentin to 2mg twice a day. Hope it helps but at this rate I'll just keep having to increase my cogentin and it stop working all together at the highest dosage and I don't know what I'd do then. So I told her about my paranoia... she asked me if I wanted to increase my saphris... told her that I didn't because of the dystonia symptoms on THIS dosage that I was having. I told her I'll just try to stick it out until then and try the injections when I see her. If all else fails.... I can call her back again or go to the hospital. I feel very discouraged right now.
174364931,"Experience from a former relationship. I (male): Diagnosed ""schizoid personality"" (but not SPD) Partner (female): Diagnosed ""schizophrenia"" and I'm pretty sure also a personality in schizoid direction Didn't work out, I must admit I was the fool that time and screwed it. But I was not that specific kind of fool with other partners that had - as far as I can tell - no schizodid personality traits. So maybe the SP-SP-Relationship was fueling that specific kind of foolishness. Problems: - Two quiet people with less affects form a couple with very low interaction energy. - I had the socially dominating role, but I wasn't used play that role because usually I'm not the one who is dominating a social context. But with a partner who is also less dominating, suddenly I found myself in that position. Although there was a deeper sense of understanding, a perfect fit in how we were seeing the world (maybe she would disagree on that, don't know , there was something missing. My wife now has probably (undia
gnosed, she'd never see a doctor who investigates her and puts a _USER_ID_ on her if s/he finds something ... typical axis-b ... some kind of strong and sometimes very unpleasant axis-b personality. And that's a far better fit. She loves me for being even-tempered and - cite - a rock in the breakers. And I love her emotions and her interaction, that is possible to surpass the walls around me. Anyway, despite having an anti-schizoid partner can be tiresome, I think it works better. Also for the children, now they can take the worst of both worlds into their own personality if they want to (Which doesn't mean, I'd have dumped my possibly schizoid type ex for an axis-b counterpart. I would not have left her probably. Which, again, is strange like the dominating thing, because in the other relationships always I was the one who pulled back. But not here, maybe she was more schizoid than me Ok and I really screwed it, sorry for her, long time ago.)"

175972568,"Oh boy....I don't think it's ever a wise option to assume that people have the same experiences as you. If you read more of this forum, I think you'll find that people have very different experiences. I'm sure you'll also find a couple of people with similar experiences to you, as well, but as long as you don't let confirmation bias take over, you might be surprised. So, in your heart of hearts, you find no joy in others' happiness? You need the social contract to not be terrible and self-serving? Sorry, just trying to understand here, because that's a startling statement. [/quote] whether i like it or not if i want people around i have to play nice, otherwise people will leave, so im already invested doing my part regardless of who's sitting on the other side, [/quote] So, you want people around, but are put out by the effort of being pleasant to them, even if there is an inherent logic in why people gravitate towards people who are nice, and no logical reason to expect otherwise. This seems to be 
dishonest, or at least lacking in perspective. Again, being nice is a choice that people make repeatedly, and not a character trait that people have no control over. It makes no sense for anyone to want people around who are not nice to them. You seem to assume that you make more effort than others to be nice, but doesn't that seem like a dishonest perspective?"

175972602,"I appreciate everything that everybody has said and the encouraging words given. Even though I haven't heard exactly what I wanted, what I needed was the truth, not a sugar coated version of reality that paints the perfect picture. To be honest I didn't expect so many words of encouragement from these responses, I was fully prepared to be chastised by some saying I should be more supportive of my fiance and the struggle he has with his anxiety and that I was selfish to be so concerned with my own wants. When I read the very first response I received from _PERSON_ about narcissistic abuse my immediate reaction was to believe it was me being referred to as narcissistic and that I was hurting my fiance for trying to prioritize myself and I immediately felt defensive. I'm glad I waited to respond and asked for clarity because the fact that it wasn't showed me how quick I am to make myself out to be the bad guy in my own head and villainize myself, which is something I clearly need to work on. Based on 
some of the responses, though, I think there are some things I need to clarify. This pressure that I feel to always put my fiance's feelings before my own is something that I have done to myself and I fully admit that. These feelings weren't caused by him abusing or guilting me, they are feelings that I've never expressed to him that I've put on myself to try and be the best partner I can be to him. I have the personality of a protector who takes on the role of putting those around me first and considering myself last. This may sound strange, but I am almost incapable of being selfish. I think that the two of us can absolutely have a successful and happy relationship, but I also think it's time to admit to him how I've been feeling and start working on myself to become comfortable with the idea of being selfish every once and a while, because that's healthy. The other thing, though, that I've taken away from this and need to address with him is that I can't allow myself to feel like it's my responsibility to 
""fix"" him or take on the role of a therapist. I need to seek out my own help to try and adjust the self sacrificing mindset I've always had, but he also needs to address his issues so that I can have peace of mind that if I say the wrong thing by accident it won't send him into a spiral and be able to let down my guard. I think if we both can get the help we need on our own then our relationship will only get stronger."

I worry more about my lack of accomplishments than I do how I look. I feel like everything is a deadline when it comes to age. I guess cuz my parents kinda indirectly said that.

I see a blurred version of the object moving following it as it moves, I’m not sure what you mean exactly by milky white, the trails for me depend on the object moving Like if it’s my hand it’ll be the same color and lighting like a phantom hand following my hand, I don’t know if motion blur is normal like that, but I think I noticed it because it’s more prominent than normal It definitely happens the most with indoor lighting, and low lighting in general, especially if I have my phone screen on in a dark room, and move it fast in my peripherals I will definitely let you know and I’m going to show this thread to a family friend who is a traveling neurologist. He isn’t my doctor, but after I obtain all the results, I will get copies and give them to him to review as a second opinion... I know all these tests are expensive, and maybe if you feel comfortable enough you could send him results of your tests directly and I’ll tell him your a friend, to maybe get another opi
nion and/or next course of action Thanks _NAME_, yes what you describe sounds just like me, especially how you describe the hand moving. It is like the phone screen moving in the dark, which is normal. Everyone see's this. Yet we see a version of this when we supposedly shouldn't be. Or, are much more aware of it. I had _PERSON_, the OP, go here: https://www.testufo.com/framerates#count=3&background=none&pps=480 If you put your mouse in the middle of the screen and stare at the mouse, do the UFO's going by have a translucent extension coming off it? Or is it another color to you? That is what I meant by like a translucent type coloring extension off of objects. I'm not sure if this is a neurological issue, visual cortex issue in the brain or what. Me, _PERSON_ and some of the others here never took drugs. The only common theme I see is stress and anxiety which millions of people have and don't see what we see. When I can get on new insurance and get some tests done I'll let you know.

I am religious (Catholic) and sometimes I am afraid this contributes to my depression. Last summer I was involuntarily hospitalized and was told I was bi polar ; but my current psychiatric practitioner says no and has put me on trintellix ( the umpteenth anti depressant I have been on.) It doesn't seem to be working. I am also on Trazodone for insomnia and I like that. Any one else been through something similar? I am 63 years old and have been treated for depression since my late teens but I think it actually started when I was 5.

She's pressuring me about whether I'm going to have a child with her and when I'm going to get up there. ALL that stresses me out. I tried to go into a deep explanation as to why or why not and she told me it's a yes or no answer which I disagreed with. She's also talking about getting another Masters. If it was any field that paid better, I could be more supportive, because trust me, she needs money. I've been to a few different mental health professionals. I essentially spout off for an hour, don't put in the time to help myself outside therapy, and come back with the same stuff. I even tried TMS. Waste of money. Lots of money. I'm sure I could find those things out. She's told me, but I have memory issues. It seems like she talks about how birth control affects this and that more than anything. I believe it helps he

175972676,"As far as sleep, I take Melatonin from the health food store, or from the health section at the grocery or drug store, or over the net. It didn't work without me first taking med for my bipolar (Mirtazapine anti-depressant, and then Lithium stabilizer, which keeps the anti-depressant from throwing me into mania or anxiety attacks). As for how much Melatonin, I take 4, 1 mg. pills. I take them an hour or two before bedtime, then take a 5th an hour or two later just before I go to bed, to give me a booster. If I wake up some hours later and can't go back to sleep, I can take another 1 mg. pill. That's just a general, ballpark number. I would start with a lower number. As for the difficulty, I try to get into a positive frame of mind that I can solve the problem before I start to try to solve the problem. This puts my unconscious into looking for solutions, whereas before my unconscious was set on negative, and it was looking for ways to lose like I had programed it because of childhood training and/o

Now I keep seeing ""555"" and it says; I mean I don't believe in these things but it's nice to think about. I would be like ""complete bs"" before my trips.

I have lived my entire adult life with resentment and anger over what was done to me. I have gone to therapy only 1 time because I choose to shove my feelings underneath the rug instead of speaking up about it. Now that I’m at home and unemployed I have more time to think about those 4 years I lived under the same roof with the monster whom still haunts my dreams. He took everything from me, my virginity, my childhood, my self love. And when he would get angry drunk I would get physically abused if I didn’t do what he asked of me. For the longest time I wondered if my mother was in on it meaning being ok with his treatment towards me because she never really tried to stop him other than say “enough” when he would beat me up. I wondered how was it that she didn’t know that he was molesting me under one roof. I am the 3rd child out of 4 siblings. Th
e only girl. We lived poor, always in a 2 bedroom apartment. At the age of 17, he was finally arrested and deported. For years I lived in fear of the thought of him possibly come back into the states. It wasn’t until he died that’s when I was finally able to somewhat Rest In Peace. The memories come back constantly the pain will never go away. Maybe it is time to be medicated? I have lived with this pain med free . I start therapy next week.

It didn’t last long, but I haven’t been the same since. I’m not sure what caused any of it. I think that in a sense, you’re right, we’re all “crazy”. What isn’t some kind of entirely subjective and thus impossible mere perception of reality instead of reality? None of us really know, so really we’re all out of touch with reality in some form or another."

I have literally been gangstalked in 7 different countries where they used the same tactics on me. It's pretty similar to what you describe except I don't understand it to be telepathy. The people involved harass me either in public or in front of my house. They stalk me to various locations using some type of tracking device or app. Then they talk about my private life to make me feel paranoid. As I mentioned, they insult me repetitively and also send cars to honk at me. In some cases they have sent people to threaten me. The intention is to drive you crazy, get you to commit suicide or end up in jail. Watch out!"
175972746,"Hi JRF, I am so sorry to hear about your dad's health scare, and the natural effect it has had on you. You had to be really strong the whole time your dad was in the hospital, and there was a lot of uncertainty that you were dealing with, not knowing if he would recover. Therefore the way you are feeling is absolutely normal. As people with anxiety, we sometimes forget that feeling anxious is an appropriate response to situations like the one you are facing! We tend to want to make it go away, when in fact, it is just part of our human condition that does actually serve a purpose. Of course when anxiety takes over our ability to function and robs us of our quality of life, then of course we need to work to find solutions... ...but in a situational/temporary circumstance such as with a sick loved one, some time may be all you need. Hopefully now that the crisis is starting to calm down, so will your anxiety. You will probably find in the coming week or two, that you will feel comfortable with daily 
check in with your dad/brother to know that he is recovering well...and give you peace of mind. Wishing your whole family well. Keep us updated and we will keep you in support. S.C."

175972752,"_PERSON_, I want to be gentle here. When you and your fiance' have disagreements are you experiencing fear he will give up on you? It took me a long time to realize that upsets between my husband and I were never as bad as I imagined. A strong fear of rejection was what I would find in myself. Even though in reality it never played a part. I had to learn that just because there was a fight it did not mean it would be the end of us. One day I heard a line in a song...""You're supposed to know I love you."" Maybe you will not feel such desperation if you remember that your fiance' loves you. That you're supposed to know he loves you. When you say you messed up so badly. Is this something your fiance' has spoken to you? Sometimes one should take a break from feeling responsible for their fears and insecurities. Yet if you are speaking truth to your fiance' then do not back down. Stand your ground. If he loves you he will struggle with himself to understand you and to help you understand him. Then toge
ther you two can find common ground to share rather then a tearing apart of the relationship. It can take real work...but so worth every minute getting there. Try to understand your feelings, try to find what it is that you are wanting and trying to say. What is feeding those feelings? Perhaps you are not messing up but instead crying out to have your feelings understood. It is not always an easy thing to do. To understand and to be understood while in a relationship. Don't give up. Learn about one another and look not at WHO IS RIGHT but rather WHAT IS RIGHT. At times we do not even know what it is we are doing. These times can be filled with many challenges that we set for ourselves. It makes it all the harder when we also are taking in criticism from family members. _PERSON_, in time you will become a wealth of information and have real compassion for others stumbling through what you may be stumbling through right now. Try to calm yourself, learn to trust your feelings. After all, your feelings are trying 
to communicate with you! Some of your feelings will be well-grounded and come with sound thinking. Some of your feelings will need to be discarded...such as self hatred, or feelings of wanting or needing to harm yourself, feelings of being frowned upon by others. You have a right to live this life. Find the strength within yourself and learn not to need validation from others. You are you!!! _PERSON_, you validate you!!!! I am sure there is a lot of good to say about you. Stand up for yourself and protect yourself. No need to sacrifice yourself for the approval of others. _PERSON_"

Try and not put too much pressure on yourself. Whatever helps helps. And this really is a very low dose. I had a panic attack beginning of the year and in the hospital they gave me 1mg.

175972759,"Very interesting listening to and reading about a guy talking about how Bitcoin relates to mycelium and psychedelics. The fungi.. They collect sugar from the tree.. The tree uses it's solar panel leaves to get photons with CO2 to send to the mycelium.. Bacteria try to attack but the fungi creates enzymes to protect itself - All throughout the world is a layer of soil.. It started in the ocean 500m years ago - They can penetrate through rock and grow - The seeds lighter than air going through outer space. Bitcoin is a combination of 5 or so ideas together - Uses 1% of the worlds electricity supply to mine.. It grows more and more, the programmers defend against attackers, all agree upon value, government can't stop it - It takes away the third party holders.. Migrant workers in Mexico make their money in the US and pay a 20% fee to send the money to their family... People in India get money from loan sharks and have to pay interest. Crypto eliminates all of that. It is an attack - Defending the worl

174365131,"Learning curves for me I like to choose what I do and do not bypass, and I like to be able to see what's going on around me. ^ I'm a lover of knowing ""b"" and it's relationship with ""a"" and ""c"" ^ Anything that hides in plain sight poses a threat and is thus a reason to keep an eye on it. Do have an example of how ""it's useless to see the dancing bear""? Interesting! With the Major Arcana, I always saw The Magician with his hands at ""As Above; So Below"" with his tools, the Cup, Wand, Sword and Pentacle, laying in front of him and ouroboros belt and infinity over his head to be the one to take intention or ""pure potential"" to create dances and spells (and the like) with all those ""tools"" and with ""1"" being a beginning of creating something. I see where you're coming from though: I'm assuming you saw ""0"" as infinite and potential, the fool's blind faith that the ground will be there (and so it is) as the ""pure potential"" as well. His ""simplicity"" also pure I've never in the arcana 
picked up the Fool as the subjective ""no right or wrong"" one. I've always reserved that for the Magician. I tend to see the arcana Fool as pure at heart whilst the Magician orients himself to what's right or wrong in relation to what he wants rather than what's inside of him or even in relation to decency to others. I view modern day Magicians as politicians, policy makers, car salesmen, con artists, corporate CEOs and the like. I'm semi familiar with fool archetypes that also involve the Jungian ""Trickster"" who's not so pure at heart. I know there's also the _PERSON_Wise _PERSON_ that would be a cross between (IX) The _PERSON_ and The _PERSON_. I struggle with that trend because so many people are obsessed with the green haired one after _NAME_ character joker character's relationship with that Harlequin girl and the romanticizing and glamorization of toxic dynamics in behavior, thinking and interpersonal relationships. Dealing with people like that is a complete pain in the ass. + I'm not sure why socie
ty is downright encouraging and promoting the development of Cluster B personalities. ^ This all would be more off topic political and within my scope of working with people - rather than our archetypal discussion. I've never heard of the bard - I wonder if that would also be connected to the Wise Fool I'll have to look that up They are almost always false and they deliver ulterior motives rather than the ""promises"" they're supposed to symbolize. I see that as the Magician. If there was more depth to it, then it would be the Fool/Joker/_PERSON_ etc I agree, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stranger and harder to relate to - I think it's enjoyable though! To me, masks are often a mockery of authenticity. People don't even make their own anymore! They go to the store on Halloween and buy the same cheap, factory-made, trendy and meaningless one everyone else bought. Rules to being a ""good"" person, rules to being a ""bad"" person, rules to being ""normal"" and rules to being ""weird"" or ""crazy;"" rules t
o being ""independent,"" rules to being a ""follower,"" rules to being ""authentic"" Rules everywhere. They're just backwards now. Your character in your video clip said something to the effect of even ""criminals ... used to believe..."" = code of conduct. I find this to be true to across all ""primate"" walks of life. I struggle sitting through movies do I haven't seen it, but for example, the joker you keep going back to seems to offer lessons (the way the archetype would suggest it should) and a while back you said something to the effect that in order to devalue something, you'd had to have had to have held it in high esteem at once point. That would mean to me the character had more idealistic views and values at one point. Then, we can go over to that next joker character guy (bright green hair + metal teeth) with the harlequin girlfriend. ^ He's a ""Magician"" archetype. Shiny for sure (both him and the chick are), but useless. No lesson. No meaning. No code of conduct. The opposite of the joker chara
cter you keep referring to. ^ Regression of rules even in movie theme over time. Then I look at closer to home: ^ Where I used to live, code of conduct was black humor, call people out of their $#%^, not worry so much about social acceptability and even to an extent, morals (unless it really hurt someone). ^ Fast forward to where I live now, code of conduct look and act socially acceptable and fit in. You can do all sorts of ###$ up things behind closed doors and no one will have a problem with you as long as you act right in front of them. ^ Where I used to live, you'd call out the person who does ###$ up things behind everyone's back but apparently that's ""wrong"" where I am now and you'll get punished. How do you mean it's not the mask but the people behind it? Like if the swastika was a mask: At one point, it was spiritual, life-affirming and then it was warped into violence, constriction, and mass murder. No matter what, the ""mask"" is ruined now. The energy it evokes is heavy, the people it primarily 
draws are not spiritual or life affirming. As a ""mask"" it is no good regardless of the original ideals behind it and what was supposed to mean. I'm believing that terms like morals, empathy, and the like, are also becoming empty (albeit not violently like my example) However, I do acknowledge society needs rules to survive. This goes back to a few falling through the net of what works for many. I'll have to look up the term ""dead faith"" I expect persons to have a couple brain cells and some personality - otherwise I prefer the mask. So the masks may be compatible but what's underneath repels the other, and these uncomfortable ""contracts"" are instances where the mask is more desirable than the self behind it. I just don't understand why some people dictate the terms of their ""contracts"" whilst I feel pressured into participation. Maybe it's the whole lack of ""filter"" concept and not understanding where the hell ""b"" is What an amazing way of putting it into perspective! But humanism is an example of 
a mask being a bad thing - exactly because it becomes about the people behind it rather than the principles. The promotion of exploitation in so many areas (extremist feminism, turning passive suicide and self destruction into circus-show enablements, etc) More and more, when people see the ""mask"" (humanism), they see those people's stupidity or warped agendas (hence it's now just an embodiment of the dominant people behind the mask) and bristle, dismiss, discredit and overthrow to a colder opposite extreme like further marginalization and divisions. ^ Like terms like ""morality"" and the (at a different extreme) swastika I still don't think I fully understand what you mean by competitive versus socializing masks (more so the competitive)? Winning choice = mistrust + question everything Fascinating, I never thought of it like that. I guess it all goes back to society needing structure and rules but the goal must be ""true"" and the tools ""good"" I'm at a loss though because, in my mind, it's not working at 
all. Sweet mother of God! I'm uncertain if our definitions line up. Interesting tangent though: When my little snake lines up her rat to swallow she examines and nudges it with the oddest huge amount of tenderness. Still not my definition though! Again, good point unfortunately. _PERSON_ has some sort of quote about how to keep society distracted and under control and it is by allowing ""lively debate"" (or arguments and even violent battles, as far as I see) amongst ""the people"" but making sure to only provide very limited options to use to point the finger at each other. ""Discourse""? ^ That would be an invisible dancing gorilla and exactly why it's important to pay attention to such things! I find this the same as saying humans and animals have rights though. Oh I see, I didn't know that. I was thinking about how people with ADHD really struggle to get things done unless it's something they naturally hyperfocus on and how some label them lazy. Yet, if they receive the right accommodations and allowance 
of focus on their fixations, they can go ""above and beyond"" Labeling them as ""sloth"" is really because they're not ""producing"" the way authority expects people to (which isnt in an individual's interest - especially no minority). As I think about it, for me it's a 70% issue of needing to work on my pride/ego. But how do you do it, when it's in an environment when you know more than your ""superiors"" (schooling, work, etc.) - especially when they're making very obvious mistakes? And then they all realize they're wrong and you could have circumvented the whole drawn out process of, say, trial and error - but instead, you had to sit there and be stupid. This one is very familiar. I need to try to look at it as taking pride in losing to see if I can adjust my attitude to make things easier for me. I also feel this somehow tie into your ability to choose what terms you sign onto social contracts (rather than force/pressured contracts that I always end up in one way or another so instead, I just avoid people
). This is a ""fall through the net"" kind of thing; what works for many, fails a few. ^ Especially in the realm of injured attachment capacities crossing with other factors (like other mental illnesses, being stuck in ###$ up environments, etc.) It can cause more trouble than it's worth. Especially once you start to enjoy and embrace the freedom in it. Of course, as you say, to an extent things like bits and pieces of trust (and then bits and pieces of attachment) happen. Questioning should never end though. Finish off humanism? Yes I'm hearing you, I believe. Power of the group, True goals, Good tools Full circle which makes sense why it's there but it doesn't solve the fact that those ideals are often not how the whole thing works in reality. Revolution? Not quite anarchy, but rebeling or revolting. Then again, people don't even know their own morals and values anymore though, so it might be as bad as current mainstream fake morals and obedience. What a fantastic way of putting it! I go back to thinking I 
need a dictionary and reevaluate my understanding of the English language ! Wild, I never knew snow caves existed It makes sense The shrinkage is made known, yet people seem to forget to add the hope and body repairing itself part of it I was just yesterday reading about the connection between psychosis and trauma. ^ It also mentioned children being diagnosed with the early stages of schizophrenia when the actual problem was the result of stress and damage caused by severe neglect and maltreatment. To bad people who actually intervene and treat the vulnerable don't actually pay attention to much other than politics and pills. That was the type of thing humanism was supposed to address Polar Bear philosophy or language! Translates to how to care about being: Find a reason why you can't go ^ Service & Spirituality Absolutely, you can pile up all sorts of other reasons to ""care about being"" on top of it, but without those roots, all other steps slide away easily and unpredictably leaving you in ruins again and 
again and again... You think I mean by material objects and other external things to try to fix an internal situation. I mean things that feed and fuel the soul. or even palliative care for the soul too, I guess. I think what grieving is supposed to do is another situation of falling through the nets where outsider's solutions worked for many but fails some and then other solutions need to be found. Again, fascinating! It makes sense to use philosophy as guidance and intuition. What else could it be used for today? I don't see how ancient philosophers' understandings of the composition of the universe or our bodies or physics etc to be able to sit at the table of modern scientific theory anyways - but I'm quite new to it In many ways! Yes, I was going to bring my position around spiders and thus flies up in regards to things that feed off carrion along with crows, comodo dragons etc but then I was thinking that that is not the type of fly or squirmy I'd want any spider eating. But, maybe that's why I was ok w
ith hoping for dead things for so long. Maybe crickets are better. I'm not particularly interested in going too indepth with any of it, it leaves me nauseous to do so. I just like the fact that it offers a (very) loose translation of parts of shamanism that match my experiences and it's not as ""make $#%^ up as you go"" as most ""new age"" is these days. I've never heard of pseudo-Dionysus though... ? It's one of the most intolerable customs there are.

Make sure you're safe, then don't think about it again. If you don't think you're safe when you are, thinking about it more is a pure obsessional mental compulsion. Make sure you have your fiance to reassure you. Then do something that helps with your anxiety. Chamomile tea is awesome.

175972780,"I hear you. I have been on a few medications in my life but I am trying to manage my depression without them. I'm not saying I don't ever get depressed or anxious, but it's not as crippling as when I was younger. It takes a lot of work for me to feel even the slightest bit normal and out of that dark place. If I'm feeling depressed for an extended time I find that a combination of meditation, exercise, working on art, being outside, and spending time with my daughter helps. Take it one day at a time, and if that's too much than take it moment by moment. I also find it helpful when my relationship with my husband is struggling, to think or journal about what I'm grateful for about him. Turning your negative thoughts into daily affirmations might trick your brain into thinking positive. Hang in there, you are far from alone."

He said he had the cookies before and didn’t like them. But I told him the cookies aren’t pan _NAME_. Pan _NAME_ is the conchas bread. Shaped and decorated like a conch.

Of MMORPGs the only one I would play is Project '99, but even that is sorry. When you speak of an audience of youth, you describe it seems every MMORPG on Internet. Since each needs several hundred players at least, they may not be good games. A MUD can flower with a dozen or so. Howbeit these are rusting because of a lack of players; only a few remain, and these are Armaggedon, Shadows of Isildur, Harshlands, Haven, and maybe others. A text game may be the reverse of virtual reality though; I must grant I have no conceit of what virtual reality is. Does one wear a helmet over his eyes and see through a screen? In what ways is it unlike the ordinary MMORPG?"

175972803,"It's good she can stay calm when you are having a breakdown. I understand the not knowing what to do part. That's my mom. I don't let her see. She obviously sees the sled harm, but doesn't even ask. She doesn't know what to say or want to talk about it, I guess. My mom isn't the hugging type either. Never has been. Sometimes I wish I could just get some affection from her, but that's not who she is. She's the ""throw money at it"" type. When I'm upset, she will buy me something. When I went into the hospital the second time this year, she bought me a few surprise gifts. I love the gifts, don't get me wrong. They are perfect, but I would like a ""I'm sorry you're hurting"" more."
175972804,"So, I had a friend who had recently passed away. Tomorrow is his funeral. I'm crushed. I'm thinking of him so much. Me and my ex were talking about him not too long ago. My ex told me when I was in Cincinnati during a hospital stay, my ex said how he was discussing it with _NAME_... without skipping a beat he said, ""Well, let's go down to Cincinnati tonight""... him and my ex drove from _NAME_ to Cincinnati (about an hour and a half drive) just to visit me in the hospital. A couple years ago me and _NAME_ were talking every day for a while. I told him I'm starting to develop feelings for him. This was a couple years after me and my ex had broken up. He told me he wasn't able to be in a relationship because he wouldn't be able to be there for that person if he was. At the time I knew he was having health issues and it was pretty severe. He needed a new liver. Thinking about it now he probably knew he was going to die in the near future. He promised me a movie and dinner. Even offered to pay for it. 
I refused to let him pay for it even though I was out of money and asked to borrow money from my mom to pay for my movie and dinner. Just still I can't help but think it should of been me and not him. With mental illness you have a tendency to take life for granted. I don't deserve to live while he died because of it. It eats at me. We lost contact with each other after he deleted his Facebook almost a year ago only to find out a couple days ago he passed away about a couple weeks ago from cancer. I hadn't had contact with him after he deleted his Facebook because I didn't have his number or knew where he live. I guess that's the kind of guy he was... a big heart but rather take on his illness alone. I didn't think much of it because he deleted his Facebook and reactivated it again before. I regret not being there for him like he was there for me. He will be forever missed."

Most people are so stuck in their own heads, so self-absorbed and not in tune with the people around them, that if you do show any outward signs of anxiousness, they're not going to pick up on it. You can be yourself! And if you find yourself feeling pressured into small talk, keep it light and get the other person talking about themselves. Hope this helps!"

174365274,"Lmao someone on reddit made a subreddit which has 230 people and started adding people (Including me) that have depression, schizophrenia, bipolar and that have done psychedelics, etc.. Some people don't even have mental illness and are wondering why they are there. No one knows what the subreddit is for and I think the mods might be crazy but they're leaving hints about what it's for such as ""Helping people with mental illness"". I was going to mention that it could be someone messing with others that have psychotic disorders but someone already mentioned it and he said that he isn't.."
174365244,"For me it was also about people saying that I'm intelligent just by talking to me. My analytical IQ is tested as higher than 85% of the population (Which is why I was so good at math) and my comprehension IQ was lower (Which is why I struggled with English) but it developed over time after I got psychosis but I'm modest and don't think about it like I'm higher than anyone else like doctors and psychiatrists do with their God complex and ego. Empathy is important and ""good qualities"" of being a person. People with ""bad qualities"" are often looked up to as well which is why I'm putting these in quotes. Good can be bad and bad can be good. It would be cool to have an IQ of 140 like _NAME_ and be a computer geek to dismantle the US government empire then flee to Russia but what matters to me is quality of life. With schizophrenia, fluid intelligence drops because of frontal lobe damage and grey matter loss in the brain from the meds or the illness itself. Crystalized intelligence stays intact (All 
of the things that we know of and can talk about) but with lower fluid intelligence, you can't build as well on your crystalized intelligence. That's why I want to decrease my Invega injection but stay on a low dose to prevent psychosis in the future. But there's ways to increase intelligence by doing things such as reading and other ways of exercising the mind, physical exercise and spiritual growth or generally having a good life, being confident, etc.. (Because people that are intelligent often have a trait where they have a lot of patience because they trust their abilities - But that doesn't mean that it's proof of that. A lot of intelligent people have no patience). What I've noticed is that there's no real ""thing"" in reality that you can grasp to be certain of. We're all here on this planet together to agree and disagree on things yet people kill for what they believe in and force it on others.. There's no love.. After I had my first psychosis, I was always told that I'm extremely insightful and it w
asn't until I took the overdose of clonazepam by accident as a disinhibited suicide attempt that I went completely full blown psychotic for months. I never knew that it would cause psychosis because no one told me (Maybe it doesn't.. but I'm sure that it did now that the pieces are all coming together - Yet I was told that I should stay on the injection because I always stopped my meds and developed mild psychosis.. Do you see how I was screwed over here?). Stimulants don't decrease intelligence while you're on them - Yet if you take too much, anyone can go psychotic. They change certain parts of the brain (As does everything in this reality) so long term exposure can cause permanent psychosis unless you stop taking it before it's too late to give the brain time to come out of that crystalized psychosis. So psychosis really has nothing to do with intelligence. ""Psychosis"" is losing touch with reality and if what scientists say is right (That there's no objective reality), I'm God?. But I don't believe that. 
There's objective and subjective reality which are both the same at the same time and all. I think that's why religious people think of the holy _NAME_? Idk I'm just guessing - I never researched into that. But yeah it's just my opinion because not many regular people have had an intense ego death 100 times in one night and no one wants to either. I believe science finds evidence and it can change based on new evidence. People don't have to agree but in society as a social construct, stupidity is to disagree with ""science"" and it's true. People are more likely ""stupid"" when they do. Smart people can do stupid things and stupid people can do smart things and what matters is the opinion that someone has on another or vice versa, what people have on themselves and how people fit into society. The things that happened to us are not our fault. Some are. Others will have the opinion that the things that are, aren't and the ones that aren't, are. Look at the past.. Nothing we can do about that.. We are destined 
for a destiny (Unless time travel is possible in our lifetimes - But even then, there's still no free will. In our imagination, we're here in time and space so it exists as an idea). Is this post psychotic.. I hope not. Don't mind me I'm just talking shite lol (That's how I justify what I say). I'm stupid anyways (It's good to say I'm stupid every once and a while but it's hard... Y'know why? Because all my life, people have called me intelligent.. Even my narcissistic step dad that always put me down.. I admit that he did have a high IQ though which is why he was able to manipulate the crap out of everyone). And when the IQ is very low, it's like tripping.. to a higher consciousness. Autism could be like tripping in a way with high IQ too.. so yeah.."

I'm doing well since my last hospitalization, and the meds are working well, but every one in awhile I'll read something online and think it's about me and get scared. I'm trying to learn to live with this mental illness, so I need to learn coping skills among other things. It's been almost 7 years since this first came on me, and it's been a horrible 7 years. I'm doing a lot better though. I just got a second job so I have less idle time, I have a good plan to use real estate successes to help jump start a charity I intend to create to help veterans suffering from mental health and substance abuse issues, I even reconnected with someone who could help make this dream possible.

I just don't want to let any symptoms of this illness drag me backwards, so any input anyone else has would be much appreciated. I'm als
o wondering when you were in the midst of psychosis do you become someone else at least partially? When I'm medicated I really dislike the person I became when in psychotic mode. I wasn't violent, but I had dark thoughts, that were sociopathic and I dislike sociopaths, so looking back on myself now I feel disgusted. I hope I can do some good in this world to undo the dark thoughts I had even if I never did anything evil or bad. I get into cold analysis mode and I'd go on political sites and write coldly detached things, and when in the right mind I go back on things, I dislike the person I was then. Has anyone else in the midst of psychosis had dark thoughts? I feel I have to undo the darkness even if it was in thought and not deed tho. It bothers me."

Oh wait two mods got fresh basil instead of dried. Apparently I’m now one of those cooks that must change the recipe to my own tastes. Bf is supposed to come over tomorrow to avoid the snow mix so we will eat that and rent a movie on redbox. So I should cook it today although I could do it tomorrow morning too. Also got the stuff for polar bear gingerbreads....I saw a packet mix for gingerbread while I was there but had already committed to the homemade. I think it’s going to be better anyway. I will probably wait and make those next week. I think the coconut cake is probably off the list for now. Maybe at Xmas.

So why not just post stream-of-consciousness writings here? I am trying to solve problems, too. And my dad is now coughing downstairs so that is not good. One thing I never really understood about life was why bad experiences happen. I guess I should probably stop thinking about it so much but my mind naturally goes there. One theory I have is to counterbalance all the good out there, but that can't really explain it, can it? I know there are some teachings out there that say that life = suffering. But isn't that only to some extent? Or maybe it's just something that exists, and it's our reaction to it that places the negative judgment on it?"
175972857,"Why do I always feel like im going to burst from eating half a burrito bowl from Chipotle? :-/ My roommate washed my cat so I bought her a vegan meal at Chipotle for doing that. That was super nice of her. She also cuts her nails, I didn't know this, she just confessed to it. I don't really se it necessary since she never swipes at anyone. I give her carboard scratchers so she wont do that to the furniture."
175972858,I always heard voices growing up. My family assumed it was just an overactive imagination like some people have when they're young. However by the time I was 16 the voices were really bad. By really bad I mean non stop and hostile. Hostile as in the voices would threaten me saying they were gonna get me or kill me or that everyone else was out to get me by ways of poisoning me. I usually hear voices right beside me and can feel the sound penetrate into my ears. When the voices were really bad I would hear them coming from other rooms. The voices would sound demonic or I would hear my family's voices talking with the demonic ones. Most of the time now they are mumbled whispers that are incoherent but if I get really stressed I can hear them talk some. I just deal with it and it's not easy. I used to take antipsychotics but stopped years ago and consider getting back on them. I don't know if it is severe enough to get back on them like how they initially were. Feels better to just share my experience 
and come to terms with the fact it is a part of our lives and we'll just have to overcome them. They're not for the faint of heart and we can show them who's in charge.
175972859,Morning. How’s it going? I’m okay...little tired and hot but still better than the 9 months of cold. Don’t have much ambition this morning. I’m already on the couch It is also the birthday of one of my absolute favorite people. Unfortunately she passed away several years ago. I miss her so much. Anyone have plans today?
175972860,I listen to music while cleaning too... but I use my roommates loud speaker to drown out the mumble rap crap blasting next door since 5am.
175972861,Idk...my dog chewed up my good bra and the other has been giving me bruises. I almost broke down and asked my mom to buy me one. It’s either buy one or no bra.
175972862,That's a very good idea! Me too!

175972864,"I forgot what I wanted to say. I wanted to post yesterday but I hadn't gotten caught up with reading roll call yet. And now I've forgotten. My pig of a roommate has her dirty dishes around and under my bed. I'm taking pictures of it everyday. Yesterday her dirty cereal bowl with wet oatmeal clinging to the sides fell on top of me while I was lying in bed. I'll have to ask the SW to please just let me move asap. I lost a couple of juices, maybe more. Missing hawk sauce, watermelon , and something else. I'll look again this afternoon. I wish we could go to the back yard to smoke again. The wind isn't nearly as bad there. Going out front is colder and windier and very hard to fill the tank without my pliers and juice flying away. I wish I still had tiz and ativan. My headphones got broken somehow in my sleep a couple of nights ago. My friend hopefully ordered and sent my replacement already. It's one side that's broken and it looks like it was deliberately done because it wouldn't have broken that way

I don't have any faith in the medical system either. I've been in severe pain for more than 8 years and have had no improvement or relief despite seeing many different doctors and specialists. I am so sorry you are dealing with so much. If you would like to talk more I am here to listen."

175972890,"_NAME_, given what you wrote back, I'd say that your mom must think you a godsend. My gosh! Look at the difficulty within your family's shared life and there you are helping your sister, your niece and your mom. That sounds like a lot of help that you contribute on a regular basis. No doubt it adds up to much work which you help your family be less burdened with. It sounds like plenty to me. I know how hard it is to try to take care of another person. It can be emotionally and physically draining. A break from being a caregiver usually ends up somewhat a rare occurrence. You are a caregiver, just an unpaid caregiver. Have you any idea of how much money caregiver's are paid hourly? It is certainly not cheap. Where would your mom be without all of your help? Ask her and I am sure she will tell you how much she needs you and appreciates you. Insurance and the way it is applied can be so unfair. Our healthcare system truly fails so many, many people in various ways. You are not the one responsible in h
ow much medicine(s) costs. Nor are you responsible for how your insurance is applied for your healthcare needs. I am glad you let me know how you are boxed in by both insurance and monthly medicine costs. Your mom knows firsthand you cannot help how things are in this matter. Thank goodness you also understand. I am truly sorry you are boxed in by our society at present. It is an injustice so many people have in common with you. Perhaps there will come a time when things will become changed and you will fly like an eagle. In the meanwhile, I think your mother would be lost without your day to day help and all that you do for your family. Take the time at hand for now. I think it is wonderful you want to go out and get a job. It speaks volumes about you. Your desire is to help even more than you all ready do! What a good and caring heart you have within you. Your mom must be so very proud of you and who you are. If you have finished high school, maybe you might want to look into further education. Given your s
ituation and your family's needs I would bet you could get much financial support from the government to take college classes. It may be provided to you free of charge. You could maybe take up classes on-line. Then, with a college degree and even perhaps a chosen profession you will become free from this box society has you in for now. Don't despair, I think you are in for a very bright future. And I fail to see how you are a burden to anyone. Society happens to be a burden to you. _PERSON_"

I keep thinking of the movie A Beautiful Mind. _NAME_ character had the very same illness,but he had it even worse than I did, but he led a productive life despite it all and had a family. He was an amazing man, but I keep thinking, if he can do it why can't I? I'm just now beginning my journey, it's been a long one tho, but I'm finally on the path of light not darkness. I want this path to continue. It's why I'm here, asking you for any tips or insight you might have. I came close to death, I had the means and the will, and was saved by blind chance, my mom so I've had my Jesus moment. For whatever reason God if he exists decided he wasn't done with me yet, for whatever reason. I'm thankful for his mercy, and I won't waste this new lease on life.For all the darkness I typed, I need to do light so if I ever face him, it won't be crawling on my belly in shame. I found my purpose in the midst of all of all this hell though. Odd how life works. I go fro
m nearly offing myself one moment, to being saved by blind chance, now have a real plan on doing some good in this world and with my life which was lived selfishly for a long time once I lost my purpose. I intend to walk the path of light tho this time. I've spent too long in darkness. I've lived a selfish existence for far too long, I need to make amends for it. I will do some good in this world god willing. Let my story be an example, that just because we have this illness we shouldn't let it define us, or beat us. I won't. I hope the rest of you don't either. Even someone as flawed as me has a real chance to do good in this world. I'm thankful for the chance, and I intend to make it more than a chance. I've begun the first step on a long journey, but it's a path in the light, not darkness. I have much to make amends for, but I intend to."

175972901,"Yeah. I probably won't be getting either PS5 or Xbox Series X until they announce a ""Slim"" version or a ""Pro"" version. These companies always come out with better hardware like 3 years into the console's life, and there is usually a price cut involved with the ""slimmer"" versions. Plus, the economy is crap and will take years to recover according to analysts, so I expect a price cut at some point, possibly even 1 year into the console's life because many cannot afford the leaked Target price ($399 for the discless version of the PS5)."

Would these very real tech companies' unethical research explain what is covered up as a conspiracy theory or make-believe?

One aspect is, that introverts for example, are physically drained by the company of certain others. It is the superficial fake relationships requiring tedious small talk and the kind of conversations that demand you dumb down, or, act in a way contrary to your nature,that are difficult to maintain. It is nothing to do with an inability to maintain complex relationships. In fact the more complex and in depth, the more energising at times. I bet you prefer the company of your dog over some humans in spite of being able to maintain complex relationships with others such as family. To prefer the company of animals is nothing to do with an inability to form complex relationships.

175972925,"So I've been talking to my good friend and former Psychforums Site Admin _PERSON_ about literature, and we got to talking about film adaptations of classical literature. I brought up Sense and Sensibility, and he said he's never read it or seen the movie, but he did say that he read Pride and Prejudice (both are _NAME_ novels) and said every film adaptation of that was awful, and I had a feeling, just by looking at the trailers for the Sense and Sensibility film, I wagered that it too would be awful, even before he said that. _PERSON_, however, only has about five or six film adaptations, despite the fact that Sense and Sensibility was published forty years earlier. They're completely different books, not only by genre, but by experience too. _PERSON_ makes you think on things throughout the book, reflect on your life and your feelings on matters. It's an adventure book, yes, but it's a modernist novel, and from what _PERSON_ told me, it's the first modernist novel. Sense and Sensibility, while a f
antastic book, isn't like that. It's quite slow at first, and then bombshell after bombshell happens, and you get excited to find out how the characters are going to react to it. Is the ending rewarding? In some regards, yes, in others, no, but it's still a fantastic piece of literature. Mark _PERSON_ hated _NAME_ novels, and Mark _PERSON_ was a dope Mo'fo, but I sincerely enjoyed the book. I don't think it's one of the greatest pieces of writing ever, but it's enjoyable, nonetheless. _PERSON_, however, will stay with my for a while."

175972929,"I don’t really open up. I make them open up to me first. Most people like to talk about themselves and like to be taken care of, so I focus on listening to their story while giving them some good experiences. “What kind of food do you like? Have you tried this restaurant?”, “How was your day at work? Ah sorry it was stressful, hey let’s go to the Karaoke that’ll probably cheer you up a bit”, “Oh you want to go shopping? Let me help picking up clothes for you”, “You feel overwhelmed? I know this swimming pool that barely has people in it and it has a good view, we can talk there while relaxing at the same time”. I do things like that (won’t do things that I personally don’t like though, so I suggest things that I know I would enjoy as well). Some people say they hate small talks but I think small talks is like a door for the real conversation. We don’t come up to people we just meet and ask them about their childhood traumas or political views for example. It’s just not 
realistic. Once I become friends with people for a while though, when I open up it’s just natural."

So I get off, walk to CVS, grab a few things, and had to walk all the way back. I’m more mad that I put money in the fare box and yet didn’t find that out until downtown that they’re closed. So that’s a wasted $1.50. I know it’s not much but I set aside a certain amount each month for bus fare and it adds up over time. Anyway, I was able to get a few things at CVS. A round brush, eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipstick , and hair dye. I’ll still need to go to Walmart at some point when their electricity is fixed to get the heat protectant for my hair for when I blow dry it. Sorry, this is kind of a rambling post.

175972954,"Cuz that's opening up and looking at the self and spiritual and stuff. Most women are not attracted to that. But I've seen many attracted to me cuz I talk about my feelings. Because women dream about someone that is caring and not an asshole. One had a bf that abused her and thought of me as perfect cuz I told her good things. But it's fun to be with an asshole after abuse and then to get abused, then the woman wakes up and becomes spiritual in that way. Like my mom after my step dad won the lottery. He beat her. Just depends on things. Your ex abused you and then you found someone better. If he's the right person for you, only you knowwww... yeet! Femininity and masculinity. Everyone has both traits. They are both apart of some shakra or something. Like the DMT spirit elves which can be males or females to guide you through the journey. Everything is really mixed paint and must be understood or coloured strings weaving through each other until time stops."

175972961,"I’m 35. I have three wonderful children. They’re all healthy, well-adjusted, doing very well in preschool or middle school. My eldest is 13, he’s in the gifted programs at school. My two youngest( boy, then the baby is my girl) are “Irish twins “. That’s what the nurse at the hospital called them. Because they’re less than 12 months apart. They were born 11 months almost apart. So, every year there is a 3 1/2 week period, where they are the same age. But my youngest turned 5, and 4, this past year. I’m adopted. So is my older brother. I was adopted when I was five weeks old. I grew up in a very healthy, stable, loving family. My parents are my parents I love them dearly. Almost codependent. I went to private schools, went to college. Have seen a therapist for my situational depression, since I was 13. Same therapist. He’s on my speed dial. I’ve taken Adderall since I was 12. it helps me. I have ADD/ADHD. situational depression and a spatial disorder.( I don’t like people in my 
face, if they were not invited to be in my face. I.e. I have to be sedated to go to the dentist, etc.) My children are the exception. I want snuggles and hugs and kisses from them 24/7. They are the lights of my life. However I’ve noticed recently, I’m becoming more and more prone to panic attacks and then anxiety attacks, just going to the grocery store or going to get gas. going to Walgreens. Going to pick the babies up from daycare. I like being by myself, as an adult. When I was a teenager and early 20s-I was a social butterfly. Very comfortable being out and about. I was raised socially, from a wealthy family in the south. I was a debutante. as I’ve gotten older I truly enjoy my own company and the company of my family. But it’s getting harder and harder to get in the car or even go outside. Now more so recently, on the days when I don’t have my children, because they’re with their dad, I can’t even leave my house. I can go to my front porch. And that’s it. I haven’t been in my backyard

I'm guilty of letting people walk all over me because like the fool in the story, because I want to make people happy. The Fool - Fruitsbasket YouTube _PERSON_ has a point Once upon a time, there was a foolish traveler who had gone on a journey. Why was he foolish? Well, because he was fooled by everyone he met! ""Please, some money for medicine...?"" Everywhere he went, people made up all kinds of sad stories to tell him, and the traveler fell for every one of them. ""I have a sick younger sister..."" ""I don't have money to buy seeds to plant in my fields."" Pretty soon, his money, his clothes, even his shoes had been cheated away from him. But the foolish traveler was always glad to help. And he always told the people the same thing. He said: ""I wish you happiness."" But by this point, though, the traveler was completely naked, and with nothing left to cover himself, he decided to leave the main r
oad and travel through the dense forest, where no one could see him... But soon, he was discovered by the goblins that lived in the woods. The goblins wanted to eat the traveler's body, so they begged and pleaded, and used kind words to try and trick him... Of course, the traveler was fooled. First, he let the goblins eat one of his legs. Then an arm. Then more and more... Before it was over, all that the traveler had left was his head. He'd even given his eyes away to the last of the goblins... And as that last goblin was eating the traveler's eyes, he turned and said ""Thank you, traveler. In return, I leave you this present."" What the goblin left was a slip of paper, with the word ""fool"" written on it. The traveler couldn't see it. He didn't know what it was. Even so, tears began to flow down his face. ""Thank you,"" he said. ""This is the first present anyone ever gave me. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Thank you."" Even without his eyes, he cried and cried, great tears of joy. Then, the traveler died, th
e smile still on his face. see? loss, hardship, things like that? you can’t only focus on them. the traveler didn’t…he never thought about his own troubles at all. i imagine that it probably does sound really foolish to some people. but i don’t think he’s foolish at all. even though other people probably think he was being tricked? i don’t think he was. i think he did exactly what he wanted to do. i think, more than anything, he just wanted to make others happy."

175973013,"Well, I gave the example of bears can walk on water (and swim under too!). There are plenty, like people dying all the time around the world. There is nothing anybody can do about it, so it is for the most part occulted, unless it is big or unusual, like a coronavirus. But then again, that virus was there all along, we just didn't see ""b"". And of course, there is no time in studying all of them and care about all of them, and most people didn't know there was such a thing until people started getting sick and dying. But possibly 99% can be safely ignored, and you focus on that one you can't ignore anymore. It is the first card, because he represents wisdom, and the study of wisdom was always considered first, because it deals with first principles. So above is ideas and truth and is considered pure acts. Its where things are eternal, just like laws of nature are eternal, but so are the words. So that is speculative wisdom. Below is practical wisdom, and it is a mix of form and matter, represented 
by the ouroboros. It is preternal, just like sex. It has a beginning, but no end in sight, and it is a cycle, so the individual perishes and is replaced, but the idea stays. Just like Human stays, but not the individuals. Pure potential in that card are the elements on the table, so they are tools to the Magician, but he deals in forms. So that card is a mix between the philosopher and the artisan, or the scientist and the engineer today. The philosopher looks at pure being and causes, while the artisan uses that knowledge and elements to create individual things or those forms. Zero does not exist, it has no form, so it is pure potential. The fool is a dreamer, it is not even faith, because for faith is a form. He just does not see the reality of the ground, even if the dog barks it up. So it is a reckless distraction mostly, which is like daydreaming. But he is still acting, but it is at a music only he can hear. See, that there is a ground and that you have to stay on it is a rule, and dogs are about enfor
cing rules, traditionally, like when they direct sheep where they are supposed to go, or warn of intruders. There is a flower in his hand, which is a kind of love of an ideal, or fantasies. He has no place home, since he is a traveler. Again, home is a form, like a house, it is restricted by form and property. Zero is not infinite, it is indefinite, which is different. It can although be anything you want, just like the elements on the table of the magician. But the magician is bound by rules, not so the fool. That is why he represents as close as pure potential one can be. The magician if anything is the opposite. For having true magic, you have to do it right, otherwise, it is an illusionist that pretends to know something, but really has no power over it. So he cheats and pretend to know. He fabricates dream, and distracts from reality. Those ideas are shown in the movie the Prestige. There is a magician, who knows things others don't, and there is the illusionist, who doesn't know, but take dire measures 
do pretend to know. He would rather die personally to keep the illusion and the mask going. You can see it as pure of heart in the sense that it does not apply to the Fool. But like I said, the Magician needs to be right practically, and its about truth. But you seem to consider pure of heart in some sort of moralistic seeking ideal good sense. That would be more the second card, the Popess, which denotes purity and justice at the same time. The Fool is simply innocence. I see where the difference lies. I would say all those are Wheels of Fortune, except perhaps the politician, who is the Emperor. Primates are Lovers. Or just Polar Bear. He didn't. There is no _NAME_ in the _NAME_ trilogy. Or its _NAME_ and Suicide Squad. They are completely different characters. But overall, they seem to represent individualism, which is why they are popular in general. Because narcissism is the end goal of humanism. Its its perfection. A special individual that rise above the rest, but with no responsibility. The opposite i
s the vigilante, which is also its perfection, but in this case, it is too much responsibility. Both are narcissist in their own way. The first has no rule, the second makes his own rules and impose it on the first. Heroes are the ultimate narcissists, and _PERSON_ joker is like its dark side. Ledger's joker is more like the _PERSON_. He doesn't have a plan, and does not try to rule over people, he just gives them a choice, and both options are bad. So he does the double bind thing. They are the same, except they can sing and make music and poetry. At least the medieval portrayal is similar, and mostly the same. Yeah, I don't think so. You can look at people that give away morals and stuff. They are free, but not happier, on the contrary. People seem to be happy when they have reasonable constraints. The motives don't matter all that much, this is just envy. Maybe the king has bad motive, but it is not what matters, and should be of no concern to the ruled, as long as he does his job. More like the _PERSON_ i
n my view. The Pope is human and has spiritual authority, just like the Emperor has secular authority. But like all humans, they have motives, but in the Tarot, there are their feminine equivalent that are not humans, they are the ideals, and have no motive and are eternal. So in the first it is justice and caring, and the other production. Both are necessary for life. That some people would cheat, or those in charge corrupt, does not make a difference in their importance. The Fool is outside those things. He is not about truth of good, he is about pure being. But in the past, at least in the tradition of court Jesters, he was supposed to show the kings contradictions, and silly things that were going around the kingdom, so he was teaching in that way, by making fun of stupid things, and he was sacred in that task, he could not be killed in theory. I believe it is the same as the _PERSON_, who shows people the error of their ways in some way or another. So their usefulness is to see ""b"". They are applicatio
n of the general _PERSON_, although in its purest form, he is just a dreamer. But you have to dream ""b"" in order to see it, so they go together. I remember doing my own when younger, I had forgotten about it. Yes, there were honor among thieves. That is why they are to be replaced by better criminals, humanists. Or people without rules in that sense. Total individuals. Good catch. Yes, it is part of his origin. Two are given. One is that he tried to stopped his mother from being abused by his drunk father. So he believed in justice above authority, but it turned on him when his father turned on him violently. So individualism failed him, or in this case, heroism. So he was in a double bind situation, where he could be a coward, or be a hero and suffer the consequences. Either way he was to loose. The second, he was trying to empathize with his girlfriend that was disfigured in an accident, so he disfigured himself to show that it did not matter, and she rejected him because of that. So again, some sort of d
ouble bind, where he could say it did matter and reject her, or say it did not matter and be rejected. So by becoming an individual and different, again he lost, and there was no way to win. So he decides that masks are a bad thing, just a rule that nobody really believes in. That following it just leads to trouble, but not following it as well. Again it is an apt metaphor of humanism. They also thought rules of religion were only masks that were unnecessary, so they could become authentic, but reality is different. In this case, authority and looking normal are the masks. He gets punished by leaving them aside to be authentic, but the mask themselves were terrible as well. So he wants to show people what authenticity really means, which is not always pretty. But that's the thing, you need to accept both the good and the ugly. Anything else is an illusion, no different than the original mask, probably even worst. Anyway, you should watch it, there are plenty of things that can be gathered. Yeah, I haven't see
n Suicide Squad, but he looks like a wannabe. I would say the Tower more than the Magician. Its just vanity. Painfully self-aware edginess. Pretty much, it is self-aware, and exterior, not interior. Its an illusion, not a dream. Its just a mask like any other. I go only by the actor and the scenes I saw, but it is my impression. Just a dude, not an archetype. Different types of humanism. So the first is like the Fool, the second is having a public persona, Man, and a private one, that can be anything. The second is what humanism was about, the first probably where it is going eventually. The thing is that aristocrats, and the people that were to be emancipated were not the unwashed, just the few elite. So it is an elite thing to wear a mask, and to respect other people's mask. But more democracy means people stop respecting those rules, and in fact, it has become a sport to kill idols and rip off masks. It's been like that for awhile though, it just keeps getting democratized. Pretty soon it will be hard to h
ave any masks, because people won't believe in them at all, no matter what they are. Nihilism is pretty much inevitable. But lest you think being authentic will make the world better, the opposite is true. The violence will simply be more in the open and nobody will listen because everything will be an opinion. Its what you do that defines you, not the mask. It is a theme in the movie. See, you assume they are different, but sometimes they are the same. Its only when they are different that it bothers you, but not if they are the same, and really it is a choice that people would focus on the difference instead of the commonality. So in the movie, the _PERSON_ has a mask, but it is pretty much the same as what is underneath, both are clowns. So it does not matter whether he has a mask or not, so you could say he is authentic. _PERSON_ on the other hand, is not, and what is underneath the mask is different than the mask, because he cheats. It was the humanist rendition. Life was about complete freedom from mora
lity, that old morality and godly things. It was a common interpretation at the time. For instance, eugenism was seen as life affirming, and Malthusian theories were a given. That prosperity needed death, was not in doubt, and even today, it is still not in doubt, it just takes other forms. Except now the justification is not wealth, but existence itself, but it is still based on individualism and science and social sciences especially. Its what people do that defines them, not their mask. Everybody does it to some degree, you can't communicate otherwise. I guess it is just politeness, but yeah, sometimes they have to be taken down as well. But the social contracts I am talking about are ideals. Its the idea of a few men, without any culture, starting over, and what would be reasonable for them to do. It was the project of the Enlightenment, which is also the basis of humanism, because from those fictitious scenarios, came ideas of rights and ""self-evident"" principles about human nature. They were self-evid
ent to them, because some philosophers had told them so, based on those fictions. However, since the basis of that fiction is man as an individual, then the only thing truly evident, is doh, individualism, which is the end game of humanism. All the rest, the rights and so on, are simply masks, and things people just made up in their scenarios. People are bound to figure it out sooner or later. Its the only self-evident thing, because it is the only thing that was defined to start with, so nothing outside of it will even hold any water. Its what the whole society is based on, so there is no choice there but to accept it. Sure, but the point was to be authentic. Its the hero Faust, which does terrible things and has no principles. He sheds his principles to live an authentic life and people around him suffer, yet he is still a hero, and avoids the fire of Hell. It was and still is, people's dream. Sure, it is inevitable. It was designed for that. The competition was the liberal ideal. So individuals competing b
etween themselves, and creating wealth on their private property, which in turn gave everybody more, because it is most efficient. So it is about creating or keeping an elite that owns production and trade it. The socializing is the individual but as an equal, which derives from democratic ideals, where there is one vote per individual but all participate and decision making is flattened. This also means that wealth has to be flattened as well, because money is power. Both comes from humanism, and ideas of democracy. The second is simply universal, while the former is only for an elite, those few at the top. Both are rooted in an individual without any social responsibility or role, just a free man with ""rights"", which paradoxically are supposed to be enforced by the government, who has no interest in doing so. It isn't winning, just a normal result of humanism and individualism. Its how it started. That's what the liberal believes, it is what the socialist believes. Humanism isn't about truth or good, whic
h is why it is not working. Its partially true, and good is only made up. Its like the ouroboros, there is always a new good to seek, always a new product to buy or a new cause to fight for. Its a philosophy for artisans and merchants especially. Basically, it does not have to be true, it is good if it can be sold, which is the new value. The same goes for the individual. His freedom is in his ability to sell himself, to market himself. So it works quite well for what it was intended. Its just that many people are not marketable, so it does not work for them, or the value is cheap, which is no better. Its the right definition, to want a good. Its the Eros, and is the only one that is instinctual. Other definitions are moral. And by the way, it is the humanist way, because it is the individual that matter, everything else is either a myth or a tool, or both. Yes, but in doing so, he is pointing to the elite, accusing them of doing what he is doing. Of course he also is an elite himself, so it should not be tha
t surprising. Although his whole life work is looking for ""b"" in politics, which is why he got popular. People thought things were wrong, so he gave them a narrative explaining the masks and so on. He is a killer of idols, just like the humanists, and that is also a distraction. If by right people mean obligation perhaps, which for most, seems to be the case. But is is competition. You have the right to succeed, and even the right to fail, but not the right to give up the game. When people have the actual right to give up and still live, then perhaps it will be a next stage of humanism and its end. Maybe, but there is a lack of interest in things spiritual or intellectual as well usually. Or at least it looks that way, but supposedly there are or can be biological reasons for those appearances. Nevertheless, what people called acedia was a spirit in constant distraction or what they should be doing, so there is a lack of care about what should be. It will include chores, but indirectly, more like a causal t
hing. But really they were interested in prayer and contemplation mostly. Attending school is the same thing, its a form of contemplation and you don't get to choose what you may or may not learn, so you are supposed to care generally. Again, it is simply humility of knowing that maybe you don't know, or maybe you do, but maybe the other has other priorities or experience. I mean, you can point mistakes out, but you will have consequences, just like the _PERSON_ did. See, the whole point of being a superior is to be just that, it is the priority. Whether things are mistakes or not does not matter. So pointing it out will just be either taken as a challenge to authority, or dismissed, but will more likely than not lead to resentment and possibly a threat. Its not the end of history. The ouroboros never stops, unless people are all dead of course. Actually, I would say it is the opposite. You need good goals, but true tools. Of course the good goal needs to be possible, so true in that way. But wanting somethin
g that is, is the most sure, so if the good and true are the same, then you already have it. So the truer it is, the closer it is as well. Well, yes, the whole point of ideals is that they are not real, which often leads to deception and resentment, and overall a bad life. They are only good if they are true, or can be at best, but really the satisfaction comes when they are true, when the good is achieved. I don't know, it looks like people have opinions on everything, which is a bit of the problem with democracy, you are supposed to care about everything and know everything, and that is hard and time consuming, although most people just fake it. Another example why to avoid ""b"" sometimes that can be advantageous. But people might know if you watched the wrong TV station. Its pretty mainstream, unless you think love is eating your cake and keeping it too. No, it is a result of it. Education and child rearing becomes a private matter, so humanist thinking means not saying anything in the face of abuse, unle
ss it is some sort, like physical abuse, but psychological and drug abuse are fine. People didn't want to be moralized and do what they thought best, and not only that, but children were supposed to be left to their own device as well, so ignored. The cause was supposed to be social/religious, the individual was good intrinsically. All they needed was to emancipate themselves of bad ideas, and things would magically be good, or follow their feelings and stop repressing, that also was to be good. Giving a pill is individual, and is not moral, so it is fine. No superstition of any kind. Or THE reason, not A reason. There is only one. RIght, like the ouroboros. There is nothing really internal. Ideas and dreams and emotions are still external to your self. Only the self is invaluable, at least for you. Others won't value it any more than what it can be used for. What fuels is good things, like seals, but you think eating seals is not love, which is where the mistake is. If you think like that, and put some weird 
moral ideas over normal things like eating, its just a case for not being happy ever. If you have to feel guilty for eating, you will die. Yes, but if you eat the seal and then feel aggrieved about it after, you just shot yourself in the foot for no reason, instead of cherishing its memory, and perhaps find a new one. The composition of things is not philosophy, it is the thing of artisans. Physics, yes, but aside from details, the Ancients had it right for the most part, a lot more than we give them credit for. If anything, the whole field has become delusional, so I would say they were better, just didn't care about math, which again is a thing of artisans. Measures are highly overrated. Spiders keep their prey alive a long time, alive but not quite. I think he is behind all those hierarchy of things, like spiritual on top, and material at the bottom. He was the one that did those classifications. Anyway,, that is what I think, I could be wrong on that, but he was an influential Christian thinker, whose ide
as lasted a long time, and influenced hermeneutism quite a lot. Its a mix of semi-obscure theology and alchemy. Yes, I don't really know what you mean by those things, like emotional tourism that upsets you. Scholars are known to be in an ivory tower, and these days, they are usually activists, at least in social sciences, and more and more everywhere."

175973017,"Good morning The pilot light went out on my water heater so I had to take a cold shower this morning since I have no idea how to deal with this new heater. I called our maintenance man after and he came and lit it for me. It's warming up now. It's another beautiful day out there today--chilly and sunny, just like I like it in winter time. I've got a couple of errands to run today but other than that, not much going on. Another low key day. Yesterday I began filling out the application to volunteer at our local museum of fine arts, so that's some progress. Hang in there everybody."

175973029,Hi. Just left the Dr. they lowered they Cymbalta to 90 mg and have added 10mg of Lexapro starting tomorrow. I’m praying that this gives me relief.
175973030,Yes I am
175973031,"Sorry BB <3 Your fear centre is activated. Happened to me yesterday but I didn't panic. I was very suicidal but olanzepine is a really good mood stabilizer. Being honest with my family helps a lot. I started off with a panic attack like 4 times a week this summer. Now it's been 2 weeks without one + only a few in the past 2 months since I was in the hospital and put on olanzepine. I think the SSRI that you're on could be contributing to the panic. I felt emotionally numb (A form of dissociation) on Prozac and once I realized that I couldn't listen to podcasts anymore, I stopped taking - But talk to your doctor about it. Humour/laughter helps. It's like the opposite of fear...."

175973035,"I have a bit of this, too, but mine is mostly related to health issues -- my UC and I recently had a very severe 3-day migraine that made me extremely sick. I get very worried about being away from home and getting sick. I also hate being away from home (and my cat) overnight now. That makes me extremely anxious. I also can't stand traffic. I live out in the woods, so I only have to deal with bad traffic if I go to nearby cities. I would never live somewhere where I had to deal with bad traffic often. It doesn't matter how good of a driver you are because there are a lot of terrible drivers out on the road. Sorry, that probably doesn't help your anxiety."

I felt bad about breaking up with Regular T but I don't think you can see two at the same time. And Regular T wasn't helping me that much. I feel okay because I know it was the right thing to do.

175973044,"I felt like the universe was really against me this morning. My mom has a sinus infection or something so she keeps getting headaches and tinnitus. She's getting a CT scan in the city. I was going to go with her and read in the car but didn't feel like going. I lied in bed and my mom told my sister to brush the snow off of the car. I went to get some coffee and my mom told me to shovel the snow off of the steps - So I did that in my pj's - My cat needed to use the litter box and doesn't go on her own. My sister waited until the last minute and when I walked inside, my mom was crying and frustrated that my sister didn't do it - So I helped my sister and took the ski's off of the car. It started snowing again and I was afraid of my mom driving alone but I wanted to take a shower - So I did that but she left already. I'm afraid of her driving with no cell phone service and getting heart arrhythmias (Especially after quitting drinking alcohol cold turkey for 2 weeks since yesterday). My mom seems reall
y stressed out and sad. I feel such mental pain when I'm bossed around by an addict cuz it reminds me of my ex step dad. He was basically like a crack/cocaine addict but really he had high blood pressure and smoked a lot of cigarettes and drank a bottle of _NAME_ a day. I'm worried about my mom driving on her own. I cleaned out the litter box and vacuumed my room and the hallway, filled up the water.. Now I need to keep track of my meds etc.. Nothing seems to be going my way. I just said to myself, ""Stay calm.. Don't have a mental breakdown""."

175973047,"Because of the psychiatric medication I'm on, sometimes I feel a little bit dizzy if I get out of my chair or out of my bed quickly. But I've never had issues with feeling dizzy all of the time."
175973048,I knew about this. Benztropine being one of them (for side effects)
175973049,I went to work at 8:30am. They told me to go home and come back at 11 because theres nothing that needs to be done until the afternoon.
175973050,I should’ve been doing that when it was here but in my recent defense it’s literally been raining every day since the winter storm has been gone. So like for 2 weeks now or so.
175973051,Yeah. I’m probably **** out of luck really. I need to start being more proactive with my health. I’m down 20 pounds since I first moved in with my friend. However I’ve went a couple days without eating much really a few times. It wasn’t because we ran out of food It’s like my apatite went away. I’m also chasing kids around the house and cleaning a lot.
175973052,"It's been years since I've been in therapy. But for a long time, I was. A lot of the advice I've been given by various psychotherapists over the years was helpful to me and was, in my opinion, good advice. It really helped me overcome my mental health issues. And I remember a couple of those counselors told me that the advice they give to clients like me isn't just good for those with mental illness to hear. It's also good advice for just about anyone to hear. I think they were both right. The advice therapists give isn't just good and helpful for those struggling with mental illness. It's good advice for just about anyone."
175973053,Anyone heard from _AT_MENTION_? How are you doing if you are out there?

175973058,"And yes, only listen to psychiatrists as they are the most qualified. I know the idea of not having sz sounds too good but in 95% of the cases its sz with meds for life."
175973059,"Waiting on the grocery delivery, then gonna meditate, read, and listen to some Catholic podcasts."
175973060,I mean you have a good personality so people are more likely to treat you well. It’s always been an asset even when you were sick like five years ago....
174365558,Abilify pretty much did nothing. No real side effects and it was like I wasn't on any meds.
174365539,"I think this ties in with my negative symptoms and positive symptoms are the reason that negative symptoms exist. It's just so hard to think about for me. I want to understand everything but there's the general feeling that I know the truth. What is the truth you ask? The paradox. Is schizophrenia when you don't know the truth but you're seeing messages.. or is it high intelligence analytically for a disruption of being likeable or having friends. Why do people that are in weed psychosis always like to talk to me? What do they see in me? It's very strange Newtus. These things are very strange.. the whole act.. it's all an act.. But I'm on the good side. I'm not evil. I'm Jesus (Jk). But I could think that couldn't I? There's a fine line between the two sides of the paradox. I just can't understand all of it. I look at the big picture... while drifting into ""psychosis"" (I don't understand that really. I should ask a psychiatrist).. and people that are highly analytical tend to pay attention to det
ail. It's quite beautiful.. all of these connections.. but the world is doomed. We're screwing everything up by not understanding. Understanding is the opposite of apathy.. Yes I research lots.. Spirituality and awakenings are true... Some people use psychedelics to trigger it.. Some of them develop schizophrenia.. Weed same thing.. But only people with ""the gene"". I swear what I'm obsessed about it to help me. A desperation. Why do scientists or particularly, psychologists and psychiatrists or any profession study certain things that they are interested in? Why are the interested in it? Family background, childhood upbringing.. It's all crazy stuff.. But yeah I could go on twitter but Idk what to name myself.. Something about psychosis and psychedelics or world peace,.. But something I've always loved is music. I love it so much. I'm hypersensitive to lyrics.."
175973061,"I started to think about my old psychosis and the professors, and how I saw a professor 15 months ago completely lose her self control. I mean, she lost it completely as she shielded her face from me. I understand why but it's been so long ago. Plus, all the things I said that those professors said about me, those were all true. Every single quote I gave them came out of their mouth. I was working alone today for awhile and it got quiet. So my mind went straight towards the gutter and drudged up the past and now I feel awful. I can barely feel depression anymore, but im feeling it bad right now. when I did it, it was me, but it wasn't. Seeing that professor's reactions years later, I mean, wtf. I just think that I must be the really bad guy."

175973064,"Yes I told my psychiatrist I was taking Quinine because _PERSON_ said Hydroxychloroquine prevented or cured covid19. But it does have some uses. Like it helps with muscle cramps, but it can raise your pulse/like a stimulant and can cause hypersensitive reactions. I was taking 500mgs like every other day which was likely a dangerous way to take it. But it did help with my muscle cramps to be honest, and it calmed me down a bit, made me feel awesome. It caused my ears to ring worse/and increased mania. I had to stop taking it…had to get on Ambien too because now I am dealing with insomnia."
175973065,"Desoxyn, if you don’t mind me saying this, you don’t need to learn or know everything to start something. Just start and you’ll learn along the way. Also it’s probably good to know that no matter how smart you are you can’t predict everything. Who knows what investment, a good job, or even a relationship will bring to you. Life is unpredictable. We will find the meaning along the way, there’s always new ideas, there’s always new perspectives, definitions, meanings. I believe you’ll get there one day, I’m rooting for you. If you don’t like me saying this then just ignore ^^"

175973074,"I took Lexapro generic and it seemed to work quickly for me, though my therapist says that isn't possible. I disagree. Some meds work fast for me. I am sensitive to antidepressants. My problem with SSRI's is that I do well for two to three months. Then I get side effects that do not go away. Where most people get the side effects in the beginning and they go away in 7-10 days. And the Lexapro did that to me. But I sure did feel better while taking it. Mentally. I don't seem to get the morning anxiety unless I have something to do or somewhere to go. I think I have anticipatory anxiety. Before I have to go somewhere I get bad. Sometimes I take Xanax and it helps. After I get in the car and out on the road, I am usually (not always) okay. I hate the feeling. And for me it is hard to explain. It is both mental and physical. I hope that the Lexapro works for you and quickly. I hope it lessens the anxiety for you. Do you ever try meditation? Morning meditation is nice. Especially early. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175973075,"As mentioned in another thread, I am starting to taper off my Zoloft. I know that some people experience increased anxiety when tapering. How can I distinguish the increased anxiety that is a side effect of tapering from a ""relapse of anxiety"" that might suggest I stop tapering and potentially even increase my Zoloft dose? I imagine the two might feel very much alike. Although I do not want to me on medication, I am open to ending the tapering if it is necessary because of a relapse. Thanks for any insights on this."

I was watching him talk about conspiracies and explained what the illuminati is and masons etc... Holding secret information.. I hope I can stop my antipsychotics and I don't really have schizophrenia. I believe I was just too young to be able to handle reality. It's ok to talk about out of touch things - You just have to not believe the ideas fully and see it as a playful thing to mess around with - Or else you go insane. In some ways, I believe that my mind was playing tricks on me to how scared I was able to get and I was scared of being scared. Now I'm looking up book recommendations by Bill _PERSON_. I'm also watching a documentary on ""How Bill Gate's brain works"". He's extremely smart. One book I just bought is called ""Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind"". I'm

175973084,"So I don't really know where to begin. I have severe depression - had it 3 years ago, fought it off with therapy, medication, etc. after going into the deep end with self harm, substance abuse, etc. Now it's back, and going strong. In addition, I have major anxiety that controls my life, frequent panic attacks, a worsening eating disorder although people already tell me I'm too skinny, extremely mentally exhausted - I wake up every morning just to go to bed that night. I am extremely weak, and have no energy, but lots of pain around my body. When I try to mention this to my family, I'm told to 'get a life', 'deal with it', 'stop being so negative', and mainly, I get the distinct impression they think i'm 'just sad' for no reason. It's now got to a point where I'm not necessarily suicidal, but I don't see much reason to live either. Some days are better than others, some days are great and I'm just fine, but all too often I'm down and depressed, and the rest of the above list. With covid-19 going on

I don't really think counseling will work this time, but I'm determined not to go down the same rabbit hole of self harm and substance abuse again. Any thoughts on what I should do? A friend I thought had forgotten me recently has started messaging again, but I don't want to scare her away with all of this. I've mentioned it so she knows, but haven't gone into the details on how bad it is. I'm safe for now - I don't think i'll do anything stupid or anything... but I don't know how much longer I'll be able to cope with this. My family/friends/community haven't caught on, or if they have they haven't said a thing, yet people I don't even know have caught on that something's just a bit off. It hurts because you would think those closest to me would be able to detect something was wrong before a distant coworker did, but no, that's not the case. I guess I don't really know what 
to do now, just looking for support and for someone to tell me it's normal to feel this way, and that it's not just me feeling this way, and how others have got through it... I have a list of things to do to help but don't have the energy to do them. I text the crisis hotline almost every day now. I'm doing everything I can, just don't know at what point I'll flip out and things will get very very extreme. I reckon it's only a matter of time..."

And I'm loving isolation, so I can only imagine how the rest of the world is interpreting it. I feel awful that so much of humanity needs a special blathering of word salad to just exist. It's just such an annoying quality to behold. And there's so much of it right now as people I guess try to keep a tenuous hold on their sanity."

175973091,"4th or 5th night in a row I got mostly good number of hours of sleep. But not feeling well emotionally. My mom isn’t doing well. She got the vaccine and has been feeling not well. But it could be anything. She seems to fare on the side of being sick a lot due to different things. Like my sister. Maybe which is why they are hardcore health nuts. Idk. My dad and I don’t get sick often so I suppose we don’t take as good care of ourselves. I’m just scared for my mom. And my anxiety is so incredibly high. It has been this past week, since I learned that my sister is pretty much in a health cult and has been telling my mom she’s gonna die if she gets the vaccine. Some anti-vaccine people cult. And like my moms been calling me scared and doing her will papers. I’m so beyond emotionally not ok right now. I’m having psychosis and anxiety and deep sadness. I have been for a good awhile now. It had let up a bit when I started my meds back this month but past 1-2 weeks with everything with my sis
ter, it’s like it’s back full blown or really bad at least."

175973093,"As some of you know here, I’ve had a huge health phobia concerning my heart and blood pressure. I was convinced SOMETHING WAS WRONG with my heart. In September I had a ekg, a echocardiogram (ultrasound of my heart), and a 24 hour holter monitor on my heart. I waited three crippling weeks for my results. On October 13th I came in to speak to the dr over them. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLY FINE. no heart condition, arrhythmia, or any type of malfunction of the heart at All!!! I was so pleased and veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy relieved!!! I quit taking my blood pressure constantly and having intrusive thoughts about my heart. Although I stick check my blood pressure at least once a day. But today I’ve been feeling off. I’m anxious but I can’t find the root. The intrusive thoughts are coming back. I feel like I’m disassociating from my body and mind. I don’t like the feeling. I know nothing is wrong with my heart. I’m not going to die. It’s more of a fear of losing control/ My mind thing. I just want 
to fall asleep, but I’m also afraid I won’t wake up. I feel as if my anxiety manifested from one fear to another. Can anyone relate? Any responses would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!"

Last year I tried aniracetam and it didn't do anything. I don't know much about AMPA drugs. Ibotenic acid (In the Amanita muscaria mushroom) is what I haven't tried - It's supposed to be an agonist.

175973099,"Hello, First I should point out that I am a schizoid that has been married to a woman with bpd for the past 13 years. And while I’m not sure as to the frequency of these relationships I can provide some context based on my experience. The primary thing to understand is that, ( while I doubt it’s psychologically healthy. ), these two conditions compliment each other in the following ways. 1: They are both schismatic personality disorders that shift between desire and withdrawal. Although in completely different ways. 2: The schizoids external self is extremely adaptive when dealing with individuals. So long as there is no demand for genuine emotional connection. In covert schizoids this external adaptation can become so complex that they can, to some extent, get lost in the illusion. Because people with BPD are hyper emotional, the schizoid takes on simulated emotional traits that for a time provide an illusion of the emotional connection they so desperately desire. In short wether it’s a good 
or bad experience it make us feel temporarily human. If the illusion becomes to intense or runs the risk of generating a real emotional response, the schizoid shuts down. 3: Schizoids have a rather unique ability to intellectually understand the psychological pathology of others to an immense degree, yet are incapable of empathy. As a result of this the partner with BPD finds in the schizoid a partner that understands them in a way that very few others do. 4: The primary issue for people with BPD in regards to a relationship is finding a partner that is psychologically capable of dealing with their ever shifting hyper emotional episodes. This makes the schizoid unique in regards to other partners, as their own internal defense mechanism will disassociate from the emotional onslaught upon the partner leaving or if things get to intense. As a result when the partner with BPDs episode ends, they find that their partner appears all but unaffected, even though at times they are. 5: Another thing to understand is t
hat schizoids rarely directly end relationships. 9 times out of 10 if a schizoid ends a relationship is isn’t because they have been contemplating ending it, but rather because their partner made the suggestion, often as a means of contextualizing the severity of the current issue. And the schizoid, not understanding that this is more of a scare tactic than an actual desire to end the relationship, simply agrees and moves on. In the case of the schizoid/BPD relationship, the partner with BPD is extremely codependent. Often going to extreme lengths to maintain a relationship. As a result of this they tend to overlook the schizoids emotional neglect, no matter how isolated it makes them feel. And so long as the schizoid isn’t pressured to leave, they will stay regardless of any internal emotional damage they may suffer as a result of their partners outbursts. In the end, While not psychologically healthy for either partner, the Schizoid/BPD relationship does provide a form of pseudo relationship in which ne
eds are provided for, that often cannot be provided by other partners. The Schizoid gains a partner, That while like all partners, they are incapable of truly connecting with does ; allow them to feel temporarily human, puts little pressure on them to leave, and is willing to overlook their forced state of emotional neglect. While the BPD partner gains a partner that; Has a very high degree of understanding regarding who they are, is able ride out the emotional storm of their episodes, and will never leave unless pressured to do."

So I'm trying to think of something kind of fun for her. Ideas peeps? I need help! Greatly appreciated!!!!"
175973104,"Thanks all for the warm replies. I got another worry that I need to discuss thought this might not be the right forum for it. Since yesterday I've been having quite panic about this, since I got the diagnose. I've occasionally (more like, rarely) had tiny thoughts of, say, jumping on the road when crossing the street, or like, what would happen if I killed myself? type of short fast thoughts. But I never stressed about those because it was very rarely happening and I was afterwards saying ""don't be stupid idiot"" and continued my life. But back then I wasn't having this desperate mood. But since yesterday as I was anxious about depression, I thought about dying 2-3 times (no intention, just a passing thought for a sec) right after I really felt a strange desperate anxious feeling because of some triggering thoughts. Can it be because I am panicking about my diagnose and magnifying it, and I was talking about that to my friend yesterday and since I think that it is related to depressive mood? shall 
I really be worried or are they just because of the anxiety of feeling suicidal in any ways, shall I ignore those thoughts and try to continue my life? I mean I am pretty sure everyone at some point had some passing thoughts, likely rare occasions. But when to really worry about it? I am really worried now, and I can't see my therapist before 28th."

175973108,I’m so excited for you! I was in a residential emergency psych hospital for 19 nights and it changed my life. I can’t imagine what your experience will do for you! Immerse yourself in the activities and healing. Praying for you.
175973109,I’ll admit - I’ve never been hospitalized for my mental health issues. Should I have been hospitalized at some point but just wasn’t? Probably. There were times I was so out of it I probably could have used a time out. Even recently I could have used one. But I don’t want to step away from all these things I have going on. Work! School! It’s all important to me and I can’t step away. I never could. Even at my worst. Sometimes I feel this puts me at a disadvantage because the psychiatrist says I’m ‘too high functioning’ for blah blah. Honestly I think I just am good at compartmentalizing things. And I hate bothering people.

Failing that, any action on my part, such as turning the music louder to block the noise, or yelling ""###$ OFF"" will only draw more attention to myself. I know this. I tried. I could answer the door with a knife in my hand. No, that would create complications. Perhaps my only recourse is to say through the door, ""I have my right index finger all the way up my ass. Please be advised that as soon as I open the door I will wipe it on your upper lip."" That's a little extreme. But so is some person knocking at my door. It never gets any easier and it isn't fair."

Yet while many people are using marijuana, the FDA has only approved it for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. ""Why hasn't more research been done? One reason is that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value."" _NAME_ has said before that what he found works for sleep was 6 mg. of Melatonin and 900mg of Valarian Root from the health food store or from the health section on a grocery store, or over the net. He said they sell it at Walmart by the name of ""Knockout."" I would check with my pharmacist or doctor about that. I've taken both and didn't have any probl
ems. I'm sorry you're having trouble with sleep. I'm having that lately, too. I take Melatonin (4 mg) an hour before bedtime, one right at bedtime, then I can take another at about 4 a.m. A heating pad helps, and in winter (last night for instance) instead of a heating pad, I sometimes cut on a space heater at the right distance, and last night I slept 8 hours.

I had a sorority sister do this in college but the way in which it was done was a cry for help more than trying to actually go through with it. She begged all of us to please not send her away and so we didn’t and she was able to get help and fortunately thrived after that time.
175973181,"I find myself parenting in a way with my friends kids... I feel brokenhearted because the kids got taken away. Things are said about me and my friend that wasn't true because there's no way I'd threaten the kids. I loved them as my own... I feel responsible in a way because the whole thing about the house being dirty. The youngest was crying when they took her. She was like ""don't let them take me away""... I care for those kids. I care so much for them. I love those kids and the hurt from the separation and not being able to see the kids for over a month is hard."
175973182,It sounds terrible. I hope it will be resolved soon.
175973183,It totally does. I’ve been on meds for like ten years now.....I can’t help but think they’re slowly destroying my brain and completely changed my personality but I also haven’t been totally psychotic in ten years....there have been blips but that’s it. I now accept that I need the meds and that I’ll juts always be different than I was. I’m embracing the new me even if that new me is thirty pounds heavier.
175973184,Should we master the art of photoshop
175973185,I’m trying to accept that’s its anxiety...medical tests seem to have ruled out everything they can think of.
175973186,Right now im in a state of distress. But i have to keep my cool and think of the options and choose whats best for me. Thank you so much for those kind thoughts.
175973187,I’m kinda at where you are right now. I was off then went back on I think in September. I’m on 10mg but things have been rough in other aspects of my life and I’ve been super anxious and depressed lately. Same with just being teary eyed and down and out. I know mine is somewhat situational right now and that’s the only thing stopping me from going up to 20mg. I’m back in therapy as well and so far seems to help as well. My last depressive episode almost took me out so I’m much more proactive about trying to help myself this time around.
175973188,I've done that. I've not ate today because of anxiety...
175973189,Ughhh I slept all day now I’m gonna have to stay up all night and tomorrow to reset my sleep schedule Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

175973191,"Hey _NAME_. I just joined and I’m looking for a depression support group, and I saw your post."
175973192,"_PERSON_ got mad at me this morning. Very angry. I let _USER_ID_ out of the kennel and outside to pee, and then let her back in to roam. I fell asleep and she tore up many things. Like a pillow to shreds. There were feathers everywhere. _PERSON_ was extremely mad. This is an example of how my mental illness causes confusion with everyday things. I was confused cuz he tells me if I'm the first one up, to let her out of the kennel. So I did. But then he told me if I'm going to sleep I need to put her back in. I understand. I got confused. Confusion happens to me a lot. I seem to miss or not understand certain things. A lot of them simple to most everyone. But when I'm told to do something and I'm told a lot of little details, I get confused. I seem to only be able to understand something with a couple or few instructions to them. Things with multiple instructions given to me causes me major confusion."
175973193,Home now. Gonna pack the last little things tonight and up early tomorrow at 8am or so to start. Gotta whole day planned tomorrow. With a handful of people helping us.
175973194,"If a person suffers an incredible amount of loss and trauma and is still breathing, how does that make them strong??!!! I resonate with that statement so deeply. I've seen dozens of psych's over the years and always hated hearing the ""your a survivor"" Like it's an accomplishment? Was there an alternative choice? besides death. Come on... Dig deeper in ur training, think outside the usual reperitoire! Dying will be a relief, it's the continual pain of existing that's debilitating. Ugh,, i'm a downer today sorry.

174365749,I think my doctor is a nihilist.. He just wants his patients to live life as it is and not worry... But there's an aspect to mental health that needs to be addressed which they're doing on the chat.. About support.. Idk how far it can go idk... Idk how far this support can go with the coronavirus because people are freaking out. I'm freaking out too but I suppose I feel a slight edgy feeling cuz I'm probably not allowed to say this stuff. But I don't care. I would say I'm mostly INTJ rn. It's just what the people said on the video chat like 6 months ago get to me cuz it was about my negative symptoms... Like people mostly miss them most times.. They didn't..

175973200,Spending the day with my friend tomorrow since it's his birthday
175973201,Took another nap
175973202,"_PERSON_, I’m not for sure. I ask him often if he’s been drinking, usually on his day off, and he’s always, always said no even when he was. Even said no this past Wednesday and I saw him drinking through the Ring."
175973203,Migraine went away with some meds. Took my night meds too.
174365770,"Yeah, currently I take some Abilify. I still don't know if meds did anything to me. I like to believe they did. But I still don't actually know."

175973206,"They said a few days at the lab since they had to be sent out. I received the ones they could do on site yesterday, within 24 hours."
175973207,"I haven't posted in a long time. I often log in though, comforted to know I'm not crazy or the only one who feels like this. Last few months I've been drinking heavily on the weekends, 1 bottle of wine a night, sometimes two. It helps me relax like nothing else I've ever tried. Anxiety for everyone is at an all time high right now and those of us who were already trying to deal are especially drowning. My kids have noticed, my poor daughter asking me not to drink and my son asking on Friday nights, are you drunk again? Even that hasn't stopped me. I was a binge drinker all through my 20's, spending every Friday or Saturday smashed, often to the point of blacking out. I switched from using Paxil 30mgs to Escitalopram 10mg about 2 months ago. I also take Tecta for gerd. I tried Escitalopram at 20mgs but noticed I was getting palpitations. I only ever feel them in my throat. I researched on Dr. _PERSON_ and noticed that Health Canada issued a warning about Escitalopram increasing palpitations at 20mg 
and recommended that 20 should be the max dosage. So I decreased immediately. I told my doc about the throat flutters and we did an EKG and i wore a 24 holter. Both were fine. But these flutters are still happening several times a day. At night when I'm drifting off to sleep they wake me up with a gasp for air. Tonight I was sitting watching tv with my hubby and I felt like I just suddenly couldn't breathe. It lasted for 3 seconds and I gasped and took in air. But of course with the panic that hit at the same time my heart was pounding, dizzy and a big yawn hit. Is this a panic attack too? I was pretty emotional about 45 minutes before this just happened. Is anxiety that sneaky? Any thoughts or similar experiences?"
175973208,She said chocolate chip so I’ll make a small batch of those for her for when she stops by this weekend to drop off my new Fitbit

175973224,"This is a very true statement. I often find myself internalizing a narrative that is feeding back and fourth with the real world as if I were romancing the world. I remember being younger and I really idolized angels and I would try a lot of ways to communicate with them or persuade them to talk to me back. It became to the point where I would look for signs in the real world to see if they were somehow communicating with me ever so slightly. These days now, sometimes I feel like they are watching me or protecting me. I feel this a lot with general symbolism as well and the combination of scenes or objects that elicit an experience within my mind. I can look at an object and I am able to withdraw a world of some sort out of it within my head with creativity. Those on the autistic spectrum have been shown to have visual cortex with higher activity as well. This is something also present on the schizoid spectrum I would imagine as both exhibit the deeper fantasy life. The only thing is, i often think 
It is difficult to find great resources that properly explore the external worlds or gather the information. Which is a shame, it is one of the things that interests me a great deal. I always would love seeing what other people fantasize within their minds."
175973225,"I was told not to use it for sleep but I still do. I use to get ambien but not anymore. I was told Xanax doesn't let you go into fourth stage sleep but I still dream. So I don't know what to think, lately I can't sleep without it. I usually meditate before sleep and that helps but lately I have had too much on my mind. I only take .25mg and I only get two a day. But it helps. I am surprised they would give klonopin and not Xanax. Klonopin sounds more addictive than Xanax. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175973227,"Hi _PERSON_, I have also struggled with PTSD, though I technically haven't been diagnosed by a medical professional. I've only ever talked to my college counselor about it. I have struggled with PTSD since my sister tried to kill herself a few years ago when I was 18 and I woke up and saw what she was doing. It has definitely been hard. I tried to make myself go on, I kept taking college classes and working but I was struggling and I just remember thinking ""shouldn't I be over this by now?"" Even, after a year of therapy, my sister started to do better and got a job and started college and I was like, she is better now but I still can't seem to get better myself. I used to overanalyze everything she did wondering if she was going to hurt herself again and I would get up in the middle of the night and go check on her while also having nightmares every night. I'm doing pretty good now. I used to think about what happened all the time and now I can go most days without thinking about it."
175973228,"Honestly? I’m so behind on so much because I’ve been sleeping so much lately cuz my meds. I have all these books I need to read and review, and writing I need to do. And just all these games I have backlogged I need to catch up on that I got. Most were free or cheap (like under 5 dollars or around). But I downloaded like 5 free games on Xbox to begin with. These MMO’s. I maybe feel the start of lethargy. Well, it’s been here for a week. I’m starting to feel overwhelmed by how much I’ve gotten myself into with my personal life. The games and books. I don’t have much business-wise to do, which isn’t bad but isn’t great. But otherwise, I actually feel relaxed today and content and I actually feel ok. Cuz the games and books, since they aren’t official business except for 1, I don’t feel tied down. Which is probably why I feel mostly relaxed. I can do that stuff at my own pace, those games and books will always be there. And it’s something to do. I just really wish I had friends 
to play with on Xbox. Gosh I sound like a little kid."

175973231,"Averugen, Accepting help from others who want the best for you can feel weighty. Feeling like you are in the spotlight and feeling like others are watching and evaluating your every move can cause one to want to rebel and give in to certain failure. I would think feeling like that would cause you to resent others and bring about anger in you which you use to lash out at them. Consider this, people help people because they care. That is always a good and kind thing. Gratitude for someone's help is also a good thing. Perhaps there is always something wrong with the help because you may be resenting that help. You probably are frustrated with yourself because you might be feeling like, ""Why don't I just take care of this myself?"" Feeling dead inside is understandable when you are feeling you've let yourself down before you even really get started. Accepting help from others is not a failure. It merely helps you in getting going. Focus on a plan and use shear bullheadedness to get you to the furthest 
reaches of that plan. It does not need to be a huge plan, a successful small plan which you come up with and you shaped will bring to you a small joy about yourself. There must be something in life that sparks an interest in you. Art, children, the outdoors, animals... The list is endless though it may feel like a short list. There are so many unknown choices out there; things you would never, ever, even imagine. Most of these unknown choices people discover along the way. Finding the right niche in this world can be tricky but never impossible! There are 100's of thousands of choices out there and one is the right one for you. Don't panic if it is not right there out in front of you. You will find your way. Start out small and keep the victories at a low level. It is something like climbing a mountain. Your eyes can scan quickly to the top of a majestic mountain, but getting there will take one small step at a time. And if you keeping taking those small, small steps, one behind the other you will reach the t
op of that mountain. Trust in yourself. Remember each small step is a small victory and each victory will get you closer to the summit. Use your own ideas, you can do this; believe in yourself. And never forget that people lose their footing at times and slip or fall while climbing up their chosen mountain. Just keep at it and remember as long as you are trying to move forward and up than you are being successful. _PERSON_"

I am seeking support in living with my bipolar Mom. My whole life she has had mental health issues. Growing up she was a textbook Mom in my opinion. However, through age and experience I am realizing that maybe it wasn’t all rainbows and ponies. I am living with my parents for the first time since high school. I have been here almost two years and it’s been an emotional roller coaster. I’m having a lot of feelings about my Mom because I’m seeing her issues first hand and it’s very difficult to handle the extreme ups and downs and the nagging feeling of always walking on eggshells around her. I’m just hoping there is support out there for me. Maybe there are other people on here that were raised in the house with a bipolar parent? Maybe you’re living with a bipolar parent now? Maybe your spouse is bipolar? Whoever you are, if 
you can relate I would love to hear from you."

It gave the doctors the right diagnosis to get the meds right, which for me include two anti-depressants and two anti-psychotics, and ADHD med, and anti-anxiety medication, and a sleep medication. For me this helped me tremendously to get on the right meds. I hardly hallucinate now. And they are briefer episodes. I don't experience as much paranoia. I do have blunted affect which I think is because of the medicine but I'm not sure. Do you want medication? That seems what a diagnosis is useful for but also for me just for defining myself."

175973291,Honestly I never figured it out.....I started feeling better on fish oil or idk if I would have motivation at all.....it’s really hard when things are more difficult than you expect them to be all the time. It’s like have you ever climbed a sand dune? One step forward but slide two steps back.....you can still make it to the top but it’s just so much work and you’re not sure it’s going to be worth seeing the view at the top anyway.
175973292,"Hi there, a very interesting subject indeed. The thought patterns in Neuroplasticity subject are the default patterns of thoughts. The thoughts on those lines (I would call them lines) are, as far as I am informed, totally re-trainable. It's all about training them for thinking a different thought when triggers come. For example when you see a cup of _NAME_ smoothie makes you think of poison and throws you into anxiety, you get the habit or reminding yourself that the cup is full of delicious and healthy vegetables and nothing is poisonous there. When you do that every time you see a cup of green juice for a number of times, in the end you start thinking of vegetables when you see the cup first. Instead of poison. Same goes for anxiety thoughts (all sorts) just training your brain to connect to the positive thought immediately first. I know its complicated but this technique is used in many CBT related treatments. Just needs lots of practicing :P"

175973296,"I have been addicted since I was 14. All the years of my life revolved around drugs and how to get more. I was able to get into a court diversion program and the program after my 5th possecion of cds charge and it has changed my life. At the beginning I had no idea how to do normal daily living in recovery. But the treatment and support I had guided me even when I would relapse. They understood that someone like me that was a heavy multiple drug abuser would have a harder time than someone who accidentally got hooked on lortab or oxy after having a baby. I am 40 years old and drugs had been the center of my existence all my life. I was raised in a drug culture. My mother was a heroin addict and my father died from drinking and driving. I even chose drugs over my own children. But over the past 2 years I was able to get into an apartment and I had a serious injury repaired, I dont have any clean days right now but due to my treatment provider and the diversion court understanding and having the know

175973300,"I believe I have traits of both Schizoid and Avoidant personality disorder (avpd), yet neither one seems to quite fit my personality. For one, I do not desire friendships and would much rather be left alone 99% of the time. I only wish to see my mother and that is it and only for short visits. This doesn't fit the Avpd criteria as I understand people with Avpd actually yearn for friendship but avoid people through fear of rejection. I used to desire friendship but I was repeatedly rejected throughout my school years and the few friends I did have used me and were generally not real friends - belittled me, just wanted me to do chores for them and constantly making fun of me (and saying they're only joking! such a classic cop out). However, I also get very upset when people are critical or negative towards me, when I have to deal with people. I am not indifferent to criticism and what others think of me unlike a schizoid would be. So, where does that leave me? Is it possible to have Avpd but not desi
re friendships/relationships and is it possible to have schizoid pd but care how others treat you/think of you?"
174365897,I am not sure if I should take the recommended amount of Zyprexa today or if I should just go down on it. My doctor essentially told me I could do both things. I just feel like I have too much responsibility now. He said before that I can go down to 2.5mg on it and then eventually to 0mg (which I feel super uncomfortable about doing) or I can go back up to 5mg of it (which seems safer). He thinks I don't have schizoaffective anymore because I haven't had deterioration in my hygiene and stuff like that. But I don't really know. This is making me anxious.

175973319,you are not sleeping despite the meds because your dr was right about your mild depression. I went tru exactly same senerio and even ambien wasn't putting me out for the entire nite. once your depression lifts-normal sleep will return. trazadone is hit or miss for many. didn't work at all for me. what did was doxepin. its in the sAME class as trazadone but really put me out. a real heavy weight is remerion. will knock a horse out but you will have trouble functioning next day. now that I am depression and anxiety free -o sleep like a baby every night -all night. I suffered tru insomnia for months and know what you are going tru. . getting drs to prescribe real sleep meds is hard these days and trazadone is their go to drug . doxepin was MUCH better for me you may want to ask about it if no success with traz. its an old antidepressant and when used in low doses is effective for insomnia. traz is the same kind of drug.

My sisters still lived at home then, and had their own emotional issues. Along with complicated relationships with my mom. My mom does have PTSD and was standoffish with touching. Both my parents decided to be very religious while I was a child and any time I showed signs of not conforming to their ideals they became exceptional distressed for me. From a young age I shut myself down from being open so that I could ""keep the peace"". It seemed important for their happiness to have religion so I kept my mouth shut and went along with it. I was overly concerned with them being okay and happy since they struggled a lot with that. All the while I was fully aware I did not understand it or believe it at all. I guess it likely made me feel the need to hide and be duplicitous. I do not know how much they tried to comfort me, but as far back as

Then she asked for the book title again. The place we met at was really loud so she thought it was the strong and stress. lol I wish my novel was strong! I'm still proud of it, even though I uploaded like 20 times to correct embaressing mistakes, and trying to make it more readable in p
arts. If she reads even the preface, she will know I have a serious mental illness. The prices we pay to be mental health advocates."

I also exercised by walking outside and going up the stairs 20 flights. I feel fine. I drank my cup of coffee. I have to work until 10pm tonight, then do clerical work afterwards. It's going to be a long day today!!"

175973395,"Need to organize my kitchen cupboards and fridge tomorrow. I'm reading a book I got from hoopla about mindfulness for bipolar disorder. I've always found mindfulness to be a great way to stay calm and in the moment. It's something I try to incorporate into all areas of my everyday life. Also finishing up that other book I got by _PERSON_, a historical fiction novel. Love her books. Tomorrow I'm cleaning.. pretty much all day. I might have to go to Family Dollar and get a few things for the house like oven mitts so I can take the pizza stone out of the oven without burning myself. I need some dish towels too and maybe a few other things. I'm trying to get myself on a good schedule with cleaning. Doing it consistently every week. Praying the Rosary has become a daily habit so now I'm working on doing stretches every morning. Using the Habitica app to track my habits. Anyway, things are good. I'm excited to learn more about cooking and other stuff too by using sites like duolingo, khan academy. YouTub
e tutorials for learning different Ukulele songs. I haven't drawn in a long time. Really need to get back into art. I should sketch something this weekend, there's so many cool art tutorials online"
175973396,"Man I forgot how time consuming online dating can be. There's a CK _NAME_ skit that I'm living now because it's been so long since I've tried dating. It's the one where he compares dating again, after a long relationship, and to coming out of prison. All the cars are driving fast, he's dressing weird, and after the first date he just wants to... okay too dark. lol I'm not feeling dating right now really... I'd rather just meet women in person somewhere, but were is the question. I really need to work on my profile :-/ The reason for that facebook photo was to put it on my dating page."
175973397,Yeah i guess 500 is the max.......
175973398,"Thing is, I really can’t afford therapy right now. I haven’t seen her last month and won’t be able to this month either. It really really sucks. She’s the best therapist I’ve had but it’s hard to fit 70 dollars into my budget every 2 weeks and once a month is definitely not enough. This all is tied to other things as well. I am having the hardest time running my business all by myself, in general, because it’s expanding, but especially when I sleep so much. I sleep all day and then end up working into the night on my business. But it didn’t start out that way. It began with this med dose raise. I was just telling Door2015 that I really need a lot of help with all the stuff I’m actively doing in my life. My business, my social media (because I’ve become a legitimate micro-influencer), my working on my blog, books, and spoken word poetry on the music networks, my second blog which I have partially given up on, utilizing secondary writing websites, the list literally goes on. Plus 
trying to budget, grocery shop, clean, etc. At this point I’m wondering if a baby is even plausible to have. And also wondering where can I get help. I need like a secondary person to help me manage all of this. I’m not even writing anymore, I’m just marketing my business and whatnot."

175973402,Good morning. I had crazy *** dreams. I was wth people during the end of the world. It was like a movie.. Dragging our stuff through the burnt rubble and broken stone walls - The sky was black and red with smoke everywhere (Cuz of war after the coronavirus). I kept putting cocaine or some type of opioid on my eyes and my mom told me to stop. Took the 50mg Vyvanse again instead of 40mg. Will be reading at around noon.

175973407,"_USER_ID_, I just saw your post and although I'm rarely on this particular forum (or post here), I just had to comment that this therapist said very inappropriate and unhelpful, even harmful, things to you. I don't think any licensed therapist should say anything like those things to you, comparing you to any other person's behavior, let alone to someone you've have problems with. And she was making fun of you at your expense when saying that even the cat is tired of hearing what you're saying. I don't know any more details but I would fire that therapist and even make a complaint. I would definitely find another therapist but at the very least I would not speak to that particular one again. I'm sorry for her mocking attitude. That's just not professional. I hope you're doing ok this evening."

I can't process anything right now. I've been saying insensitive stuff without thinking about it. I can't processes it at all. Too much.

175973411,Most of my dreams last night were lucid. I knew I could easily wake up but I decided to just keep dreaming.. There was people behind glass windows watching me fly in the sun. Then it was raining and miserable and I couldn't fly anymore. I walked over to one of the open glass windows and they showed me my granddaughter. She had a brain tumour. I took off my sunglasses so she could see me and I was crying for her. lol..

I was feeling overwhelmed but now feel ok. I am doing fine. The student who complained about me partially was happier I took the time to correct his mistakes. I was happy for him. I also added two more students while two left for vacation but will return later. I am not complaining. Life is ok. I slept the whole afternoon. I was really tired this morning but feel fine now. I think this job is great because I work a little here and there. I don't earn much but am making something which is better than nothing. I am happy!! Tomorrow I have a new student starting. I have to focus and pay attention. I will and do a good job again.
175973416,_PERSON_ I know the meds aren’t great for you but are you a little better at least taking them regularly? At least I think you mentioned missing some. My only agenda is that everyone be as well as they can be.
175973417,Gave _NAME_ another bath last night. More of the transmission fluid came out of her fur. She was not happy though. I think it traumatized her. She scratched my Dad's arm pretty bad but she didn't scratch me. I wrapped her in warm towels afterward and a fleece blanket. She was shivering. She let me hold her for a long time and she purred. I hope she can get her lovely fur back. It's all sticking up weird right now. I wanted to comb her this morning but she didn't really want to be combed or touched much. She did let me carry her to give her breakfast but I had to respect that she wasn't up to a lot of touch this morning.
174366061,"Here's an interesting post I just made on Facebook.. It is inspired by my mental health and spirit journey feeling alone on this space rock that I have to share.. Nothing without everything can be explained by everything and anything can be explained by someone to make it right or wrong to anyone - which can make it right to most - But may be wrong, as it can also depend on perspective of also some or one. This is why everything has a consciousness of everything as it is reincarnated into everything when there is no time-space through infinite time. When you think but don't talk, you may talk. So when you are asleep (Unconscious and frontal lobe/prefrontal cortex shut off) but alive, you may dream. When you are alive but brain dead, you may die. So being alive is a dream. For a dream is not knowing you are dreaming, yet you can have a lucid dream, like being awake yet not knowing you're in a dream.. when you do, you are in psychosis, a schizophrenia (Losing touch with reality). You can also dream w
hile awake (Sleepwalking) or delirium from a fever from alcohol (""Soul eating spirit"") withdrawal, revealing the soul like a psychedelic (""Soul-revealing"") and hallucinate like on DMT to visit the place of dying while alive as it is released in the brain before dying for real to kick start the initial phase of the next flip. As these are all like a dolphin doing flips in the ocean. Underwater, it lives.. or does the dolphin truly live in the air when doing flips like a human that truly lives when ""feeling"" alive instead of just existing? And it dreams and dies, reincarnates like the unknown random hallucinating rock in Japan that generated this post for me."

175973436,"Hey there, I've had pretty bad anxiety my whole life as well as panic attacks. Last week was really stressful (just dealings with life, work, and an ulcerative colitis flare). And for the past few days, I've been in this constant daze-- like feeling a sort of disassociation from my body. I slip in and out of the world. There are a few things that I can do (e.g. listing out all my worries, taking a Xanax, talking things out) that can help get me out of it but it's pretty scary. I can best describe it as when you're at the height of a panic attack and you feel like your perception of the world is off, except it's this ongoing feeling. I went to urgent care and they tested my blood and gave me basic brain functioning tests and everything was fine. But it keeps happening. Has anyone else felt this? It feels like a vicious cycle, that when I feel it coming on, my anxiety kicks in even more and makes it worse. No other symptoms (no pain, no double vision, no motor function problems, sleep is decent). It'
s just really scary. I don't want to become a different person and slip into a nervous breakdown. It should be noted I've been on Prednisone for two months for my flare. Anyways, this is a lot of information. Hopefully someone has felt something similar and realized it's temporary. Thanks, D"

175973447,"People that say that take personal responsibility for their own actions, its pretty much a given for most people, and it works quite well. Of course if someone is only driven by other people, or socially driven, it won't work, and all that is left is trying to manipulate others to make them drive you, which inevitably fails and creates resentments or discontent. So it is a hopeless endeavor, and destroys more lives that can be counted. The only real solution to an external locus of control is an internal one, which means owning what one does. Its actually the opposite of wishful thinking. Wishful thinking is to believe the world can be a better place, and will magically make one happy. Realistic thinking is to realize the world is full of hardship, but that if you are going to so something, to it well, and leave something withchy. But nobody is forcing anybody to do stuff, this is just self-imposed oppression."

175973463,"Depends on the personalities involved. Many with psyche issues are overly self critical, self reflective so it is important to cultivate their own sense of self; to know when to listen to others and when not to. For some, the conditioning you describe is borne out of taking on other peoples opinions and succumbing to the perspective of others. Yes, exactly. Yes. I would urge caution against being overly self critical I get a little caught up in that thinking loop too at times. I do best when I feel okay about myself. Then it flows betters with others."

I will echo the truth that this will pass...and that having a down/challenging day is normal...even for those who don't have an anxiety condition. I think we as anxiety sufferers forget that anxiety is a normal part of the human condition. We get so accustomed to managing it...that we fail to accept it and realize that it just happens to everyone at different points. Great job on reaching out for encouragement and support! That is exactly the thing to do...because, we your friends are happy to be here for you...as you have been for us. That's what this community is all about !!!

175973470,"I don't think it's borderline. I don't think it's histrionics. I think it's _USER_ID_ hypothalamus. I agree with you I do not think it is full BPD nor full APD ( while she does exhibit the characteristics, she also meets about 6 of 7 the items listed by the of the symptoms listed under the According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), for Avoidant Personality Disorder.) I do not know how to respond to the two lives, per se. There is the I'm angry, cold, dispassionate, I will be in control person. And when I say cold... I can tell you winter survival training in _USER_ID_ is more enjoyable. Then after some time --depending on the original trigger-- there is the pleasant person who would prefer to stay home. So maybe this meets your definition. Perhaps the most significant difference between her and your former; is from her comments and one that I found most encouraging a few years back is her complete lack of sexual promiscuity o
utside of her immediate relationship. Oddly enough in that sense, she is highly moralistic. In fact, that singularly, regardless of the offender (me or her), is the absolute death of a relationship in her view. I do get along with her dad. But this is misleading. I would not go have a beer with him. We do not see him except on an occasional holiday and then usually for only a short period of time. He has prostate cancer and only has a few years. Most of my effort with him has been to assist her at mend past hurts/wounds -- hopefully, so she has no emotional regrets when he is gone. As far as I can determine he never sexually abused her. He was and still can be a mean drunk. The few times I have actually seen him really drunk, I shut the issues down- and I think he understands that will not be tolerated. While still an alcoholic, he is in quite a bit of denial from the past years and projects most of his resentment on his x (her mother), despite a divorce which is more than 35 years old. In that one since they 
do share a common bond of dislike. Her dad and her sister are full-blown alcoholics. I do also agree she is a functioning alcoholic, and yes it does runs in her family- she is keenly aware of it. She has asked me to help her quite, but I have read enough to know only the alcoholic can quit. I will make subtle reminders --but -- the response is yes, I know, but it is only one. Interesting point... I thought she might drink to keep from being angry. Yes, the h- therapy was very helpful -but did not abate the drinking. I think repeating the hormone therapy would be useful, at least for a full year, at worst it might help establish a true benchmark. I absolutely am convinced, from the hours and hours of conversation we use to have in the evening and here comments she does suffer ""as an adult from an abusive childhood."" Of this, I have no doubt, which is why I presumed the BPD. The fact is, she does not know what a stable, calm, loving relationship-- without control or rigors expectations-- looks like. She has s
imply never experienced that- by her own admission. Sure she dated peeps that ""cared"" about her but that was pretty much the extent of it. Of course, I am then left silently wondering ""well was this the behavior they experienced?"" I can recall several nights when we dated, she would sit there and suddenly say, ""I am a runner, with serious trust issues-- everyone I have ever know has abandoned me."" Then she would say ""please do not leave me."" I did laugh one night when she said that, and she asked me what was so funny.. I told her ""dear I have been to Ranger School, seen combat several times, do you think I am afraid? I'm can deal with most things. I won't leave you unless or until you can look me in the eye and say with conviction I DONT LOVE YOU ANYMORE. I have often thought about this. OK I think we can effectively rule out HPD. I do want to explore the _USER_ID_ possibility. Like I said I have been around enough to know something is just a few bubbles off plumb- still that could be me! Thanks for 
your input you have been most helpful and your insights very thought-provoking. Any comments of like nature are most welcome."

I'm also diagnosed as of 2 years ago with recurrent depressive disorder, and I've also recently found out that I'm also a hypochondriac, although I think my discovery and acceptance of it has already helped me leaps and bound to such an extent that it's not as crippling anymore. I started having anxiety attacks again recently, but I'm not sure what I'm really anxious about. I thought long about whether this pandemic might be the cause, but I don't think I am that worried about it.

175973486,"Hi, an ok week, my anxiety comes and goes and got a cold over the weekend. But here we are another week."
175973487,"I plan to read ""Beyond Zero and One: Machines, Psychedelics, and Consciousness by _NAME_ Smart review Â– inside the minds of computers"".. ""Do androids dream of electric Kool-Aid acid tests? If thereÂ’s to be any hope for us, they will. That is the message of _NAME_’s splendidly mind-bending book, which mashes up _NAME_, The Matrix, _PERSON_, Â“zombie AIÂ”, _PERSON_, and research on psychedelic drugs. In our age of techno-utopianism, we are routinely told in crypto-religious terms about the coming Â“SingularityÂ” Â– the creation of superintelligent, conscious machines. One problem with superintelligent conscious machines, however _PERSON_– as SF writers down the ages and some modern philosophers agree _PERSON_– is that they might very well choose to destroy all humans. How to stop the godlike robots wiping us out? The best way, Smart suggests, might be to give them a dose of digital LSD to force open their doors of perception. That might sound like far-out hippy futuris
m, but much of this book is devoted to unravelling the woolly thinking of machine intelligence enthusiasts themselves. Against widely held modern assumptions, Smart advances the following claims: one, information does not really exist; two, computation does not happen in the human brain; three, computation does not even happen in computers. LetÂ’s take these in turn. First, it is fashionable in some quarters to believe that Â“informationÂ” is a fundamental entity in the universe. (This may be because such theorists are unconsciously projecting our own societyÂ’s love affair with Â“informationÂ” on to the rest of reality.) But in _PERSON_’s reasonable view, information only makes sense in the context of a conscious observer. If there were no minds in the universe, there would be no information. So Â“informationÂ” is a useful shorthand for talking about the ways we interact with reality, but it is not reality in itself. What about the idea that our brains do computations? This is obvio
usly another metaphor taken from developments in industrial society. But, as Smart shows, it is misleading to think of the brain as a machine that runs algorithms on sets of data. (Indeed, he observes, this is a form of Â“dualismÂ”.) No one knows how consciousness works, Smart adds, and what our brains do might be uncomputable in principle. Researchers hope one day to model an entire human brain in software, but the gulf in complexity between a brain and any computer currently imaginable is even vaster than we had thought. (As Smart points out, youÂ’d probably have to model not only the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses but the dendrites on the neurons, and the dendritic spines that grow on the dendrites.) The problem for neuroscience, Smart argues, is that _PERSON_“we do not currently have any story about the mind that is not computational. We might be at a similar stage in neuroscience that physics was in before quantum physics.Â” Sign up for Bookmarks: discover new books in our we
ekly email Read more Surely, though, we can at least say that computations are happening inside computers? (After all, there is a designer of algorithms, the programmer.) Not really, Smart insists. In a bravura section, he explains how circuits and microchips actually work, which is far from being as clean and precise a matter as we suppose. ItÂ’s a messy soup of electrons, and the supposedly binary values of one and zero (or on and off) are not the only option in town. (Because of the vagaries of voltage, a logic gate, Smart explains, can effectively be stuck on Â“halfÂ”.) All that is happening inside a computer is that electricity is being pushed around. You need a conscious observer to interpret it as a dance of computation and information. So far, then, _PERSON_’s book is devoted to undermining ungrounded nostrums about Â“machine intelligenceÂ” and arguing that any conscious computer will probably be much further in the future than the mid-21st century predicted by technomystics such as _
PERSON_, GoogleÂ’s director of engineering. (People at Google, Smart wryly suggests, ought to be more interested in fundamental philosophy than they seem to be.) But of course, predicting that something will never happen is likely to be a losing bet. So Smart now accepts for the sake of argument that one day there might be machines that seem to us as though they are conscious. What then? The famous Â“Turing testÂ” for machine intelligence stipulates that we may as well accept that a machine is conscious if, in conversation, an impartial human interlocutor cannot tell the difference between it and a real person. Smart thinks a better test is: can the machine experience altered states of consciousness? LSD, in the authorÂ’s own experience and according to cognitive science research, does very interesting things both subjectively to the mind and objectively to patterns of neuronal activation in the brain. Only a conscious being can experience a trip. So if we feed a computer some digital LSD equivale
nt and it reports a weird experience, that may be a better test of consciousness than mere conversation. WhatÂ’s more, on _PERSON_’s view, this may save the human species. For people who take LSD report feelings of wonder, oneness with the universe, and concern for all things. Induce the same feelings in a superintelligent conscious computer and it may, after all, be inclined to help and nurture its creators rather than eliminate them. ItÂ’s a nice idea, though I couldnÂ’t help thinking that a superintelligent computer would also be clever enough to tell us exactly what we want to hear, shortly before it unleashes Armageddon."" and ""Autopilot: The Art and Science of Doing Nothing by _NAME_ Smart"". ""_NAME_ Smart wants you to sit and do nothing much more oftenÂ—and he has the science to explain why. At every turn we're pushed to do more, faster, and more efficiently: That drumbeat resounds throughout our wage-slave society. Multitasking is not only a virtue, it's a necessity. Books such as Gett
ing Things Done, The One Minute Manager, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People regularly top the best seller lists, and have spawned a considerable industry. But _NAME_ Smart argues that slackers may have the last laugh. The latest neuroscience shows that the ""culture of effectiveness"" is not only ineffective, it can be harmful to your well-being. He makes a compelling caseÂ—backed by scienceÂ—that filling life with activity at work and at home actually hurts your brain. A survivor of corporate-mandated ""Six Sigma"" training to improve efficiency, Smart has channeled a self-described ""loathing"" of the time-management industry into a witty, informative, and wide-ranging audiobook that draws on the most recent research into brain power.

174366165,"Hi _PERSON_, I agree with _NAME_. I tried five different things before I found out what worked. Maybe even more. I started with buspar, then Zoloft, paxil, Prozac, Effexor, serzone, Pristiq. Actually that is six. Effexor I took twice. The second time I took it for over ten years. I am on Pristiq now and have been taking it since 2010. It takes awhile for the doc to figure out what is good for you. You could be right about the Prozac though, you may need a higher dose. And generally it takes six to eight weeks for a medication to reach it's full potential. So try to be patient. I know all you want is to feel better, but that takes time and patience. It is so frustrating. I would find a med that helped with my depression and then about two three months into it, I would get a bad side effect. I don't get them in the beginning usually.

I don’t want to leave my family you know...I don’t understand my anxiety root. Planning to go back to the dr on Monday and keeping up doing calming exercises. Has anybody experience these fears?

I assume you are part of a program for recovering alcoholics, if not you should definitely join a support group or talk to a counselor. Better to have like minded ppl and ppl who go thru the same difficulties, that you can exchange with. Church or god does not help me personally, but faith in something is important and even if it is in yourself. If you feel like you are spiraling down, do not hesitate to go see a good psychiatrist. There are studies out that alcoholism and other diverse addictions are directly linked to an imbalance of neurotransmitters in your brain. Meds can help. You have to be open for it, so arm yourself w information. Read about it. Wishing you the best.

174366173,"Here's what I wrote on a FB OCD forum (Beware it's quite messed up); Possible trigger: I started developing POCD after I searched google ""God is a gay schizophrenic pedophile"" and found a philosophy forum post talking about crazy things - She was banned from a ""genius"" or MENSA forum, talking about time machines and going faster than the speed of light and dooms day devices. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia but was sexually harassed and stalked in the psych ward when I was 20 by a crack smoking pedophile. I'm 100% not attracted to children but what if I'm still attracted to people my own age (I'm 24) when I'm his age (50 something), will I then become a pedophile? I'm not a child - But that old man had an underaged boy living with him and likely having sex. The boy killed himself on Christmas day. The old man phoned me the next Christmas day asking to book a hotel with me and have sex. I said I'm not gay or bi and hung up the phone. I didn't realize until after that he was masturbating an
d crying to my voice on the phone. Later he died of an overdose in the psych ward. I then took a lot of mushrooms on Boxing Day and had a bad trip - Thinking love is fake and people just want sex from me or anyone else. It's weird. He was ""Christian"" and a conspiracy theorist - I think maybe _NAME_ is right about interdimensional pedophiles so I'm being targeted by people - But I'm the wrong person and pedophiles run the world and the hype about it all in the world is triggering me. I just want to let this out because it's all driving me nuts. I was treated for OCD when I was 16 but never had POCD until now after reading all of these posts especially about them. It helped to write that out. I'm at the doctors office waiting to talk to my doctor and get refills. Everything will be ok.. idk what I'm gon a do after bit I'll try and find something productive and relax, breathe."

175973514,"Social anxiety has been getting worse. Sensitivity to caffeine also, apparently. I had one cup of cold brew, and a green tea today and I felt dissociative and anxious. I talked to the doctor about how I've been feeling with breakthrough psychotic thoughts, hypersexual, elevated mood, and the social anxiety. He's increasing my Latuda from 80mg to 100mg. He thinks SSRIs aren't good for me and wouldn't put me back on Lexapro. Which is fair. Every time he's put me on an SSRI I've become hypomanic or manic. So I'll pick up the extra Latuda and see how that goes. Hopefully I won't have anymore breakthrough, and hopefully it helps take care of the anxiety too. Just going to limit my caffeine for now."

175973516,"Hi Met and welcome! I am sorry that you are having a rough time currently. :/ I know that it is miserable to have acute anxiety. Only your doctor or pharmacist can answer this question for you, but I would guess the answer would be no. SSRI's/SNRI's do not work in this manner. Often an increase will do the opposite in fact since it takes time (and consistent dosing) after leveling up to get the therapeutic benefits of this class of meds. If you can't get ahold of a doctor on call, try calling your pharmacist for advice...they have excellent Rx knowledge and can help when you can't get ahold of your doctor. Best wishes, _PERSON_ Cat"

A week ago, the US also thought they were exceptional, that the deaths in Spain and Italy were due to being old, smoking, pollution, or bad health care facilities. Yet, now they have just as many deaths per day suddenly, just as anybody could predict. Give it another week, it will be four times more. According to this guy, none of those deaths are due directly to the virus, it's like any other respiratory disease, and Germany is special. Maybe its true, but it makes zero difference in the people dying. He just likes his gregarious lifestyle. I bet he is a super spreader."

I've been alone for a very long time.. I sat outside, waiting for people to show up and they never did. Months and then years passed. I would walk to school/work and people would offer a ride in their car - I say ""no"" it's ok. The amount of times that I've wandered alone. The first time I got drunk, I drank 7 shots of whiskey when I was 16 - Never felt so euphoric in my life - Walked into town, no one there. Dancing, listening to music. Alcohol after that point was my gateway drug. All I have is my imagination - Switching around scenarios in my mind, reliving memories - Living inside of my head. I would lie on the grass in the fall, open dark country side sky.. And I'd look at the northern lights and the stars.. ""Why am I so alone?"". I always never thought that I could control my own destiny. I thought my mom and ex 
step dad would guide me - I trusted them comfortingly. But it was demonic. I wanted to escape the isolation. I owe my life to the psilocin molecules that flowed through my brain, made me see maggots and scorpions, made me realize the impossible. I should be dead. People like us don't just die all that easily. We have a lot to live for. We will be uploaded to the cloud and become technological alien entities - At least that's where my mind goes - Still kind of in the hopeless realm of possibilities and never DOING. People are doers. I dream too much. Way too much. Things around me can be toxic - I suffer through all of it - But eventually it subsides. I want to go back and change everything - But it's all perfect. I could die of a stroke right now - Be completely obliterated from this realm."

Not to mention all the stuff they hear in confession, they've heard it all I guess you could say. I don't think he'd reject you. When I was in RCIA becoming Catholic everyone there (the priest, nun, etc) all knew and understood I deal with mental health problems and were very accepting of me"
175973552,I'm gonna talk to my psych next time about getting off my meds. I think I'd do better without them. Tbh what I need is school.

I’m gonna die someday anyway, so I’m not too worried now because I accept that death is a part of life. So there’s nothing for me to be anxious about anymore though I was in the beginning."

175973562,Oh one other place is our doctors office has them now. You may try there. You mention them not calling and made me recall what our local hospital did. They were calling our elderly and getting them in. This was towards the end of the mad rush of that group but I thought that was amazing. My in-laws got their shots this way. They are not able to stay on phone and call over and over. My mother in law ask me did I think this was legit. The hospital said they wanted all the elderly in our area to get the vaccine if they would want it. Now this is just in our small town. Population about 30;000.

Oh and I have to submit my story to those two writing contests but that's secondary, i really want to start writing that book more than anything, it's been a while since I've written anything. Also, it's been a while since I've written on a philosophical topic. I think i will publish on the introduction on my blog as well. I thought about online dating today. I'm in no rush to date, and I'd like to work off my unemployment weight lol. God, what am i going to do about my hair, it's been like 7 weeks since I've had a haircut too! I thought about buzzing my hair even though i really don't look handsome with that style. I have a weird bump on the top of my head for some reason. When I think really hard i can feel the bump on my 
head for some reason. Strange right? I put off dating partly because i was off-put by that one date who asked me what kind of car i make, if i own a home, and what kind of job i had. Also, how in the world can anyone date during covid? Seems impossible, right?"

Doctor's will not give people who actually have debilitating anxiety Xanax, but you see all these people who are fine and just take them to get messes up or sell em go to their Dr and tell the dr thats what they want and they walk out with it, but people who really need it either get klonopin of valium and that medication just isnt strong enough for most people with servere anxiety...

I feel ridiculous doing this, I mean I'm 27 and I'm in this position where I'm having to basically beg my parents to pay for my treatment. I don't know how to explain to them that it would help me. It's like I'm asking them to pay for my education, honestly. It's like I have to get good grades or whatever in order for them to pay for me. Although it shouldn't be that way at all. I don't know what to do honestly. I feel like on the one hand, it is a big ask because it's costly. But on the other, they are arbitrarily deciding that they know better than me in terms of what is better for my mental health right now. So I don't know what I should do. Keep insisting that I need the program? I mean my mood has been markedly worse in the past couple weeks. I know my mood may get better, and of course, I'm hoping for that, but in the event that it doesn't? Ah..........."

This supplement has been researched extensively and prof berk the leading worldwide guru on bi polar is raving about it. I am using it and i too am on board. Our uni conducted clinical trials...other medical bodies around the world too. It heals and awakens neural pathways...used for post operative wound management...metabolism...skin healing and is boosting anti depressants and mood stabilizing meds. Am more alert and less chaotic. The health benefits i have only touched on. I am a few weeks in. Am using it as an adjunct and recommended as this. Am sleeping better and thinking clearer. Had to share it.

If someone were to ask why I’m feeling this way I genuinely have no idea.

174366250,"Watched a comedy. Now I'm tired. It's like I can DO one THING - Sometimes more, every day. It's not only novelty, but I get really tired and exhausted. Do we have time left on this earth? Do I specifically? I hope my heart is ok and that I don't have cancer or something. I feel like taking a lot of speed or going crazy - Like I once did. But now I have responsibilities. I learn. I can also have fun right? I don't really know how to have fun on my own. I need friends. My neurotransmitters were ok in the first place. I just needed to trip - Not go through hell.. But it made me a stronger person I guess. I feel like people have so many problems that there's no keeping track of them - At least that's how it is for me. ""I need to do this, I need to do that"". I want to drive somewhere but have no license or car. And where would I drive? I just want to drive and think. Constant constant thoughts - Plaguing me every day - Every night. What will my life be? I don't think it's gonna be anything good since 
I barely do things or have been for a while. I only think about certain things at a time. It's like there's no free will. I'm not happy. The soldiers made me feel really bad. The reason is that I don't see the meaning of life.. Everyone finds meaning in things that I don't see. Maybe I hate myself - But I'm not sure. I never really cared about myself. I take abuse. Like - Meh. I don't want to work a busy job. A coworker one said, ""You don't seem enthusiastic about this job"" - I said with a fake smile ""I am enthusiastic"" - Then eventually I told him I have schizophrenia (Which I shouldn't have said). He didn't even know what it means except paranoia - Never explaining this stone cold stigmatized knife label ever again. I can have emotions. I'm not defined by this illness - Or autism. I never wanted to be defined. But that's how people see me, just a label - When they don't know me. Sigh. I don't know if anyone has read this far because what I'm writing right now is so incredibly boring.. But whatever.. I j
ust want cool scientific thoughts.. Maybe that's why I like weed even though it can give me paranoia. I'm a really curious person - Even though I have the delusion that I know everything.. Because everyone does.. All we know is what we'll ever know within current time.. Isn't that crazy? I listened to _NAME_ talking about how we are being pulled towards the future.. And that the Big Bang,.. Idk.. I can't keep track of everything. I try to - Because of OCD... But ADHD makes a mess of it.. The prospecting personality trait.. I really feel constantly tortured by having to live.. I always have to constantly do something. Like my ex step dad saying ""Do this"", so I DO... It really killed my drive to want to DO THINGS. Maybe that's the reason. Who looks at the stars anymore? Why can't I just go to a concert? Live? I'm young and time is wasting. I said my 20's would suck and they seem better than I thought.. It's what I make of it.. I just want to run away.. Do something nuts and not feel ashamed for stepping out o
f my comfort zone. My comfort zone is uncomfortable. I missed out on a lot of things. And I'm gonna miss out on more. So while I wait for myself to get older, when I'm there, I hope I did good things. It's an art to live. With mathematical choices. I don't need to work counting money as a cashier to build math skills - And I often try to solve not very complex numbers in my head. It's good enough for now - No drive to continue being better. The only thing keeping me going is fear - Cuz my dopaminergic system is hijacked by novelty, pills and observing conversation."
175973600,"i don't know what he is but it's something similar. yet, we are also so different. communication is hard. usually it's best if we don't communicate seriously. we usually wander around like a couple of jokers playing slap as s . a real conversation ends with the dead quiet found near a bomb drop. it would be easier if we could just crash together sexually when the need arises and then saunter off to our respective corners. communicate via written word like we used to. instead we have kids. it makes us have to be a team and it's as dramatic and stressful as every other relationship. overall he's much less tedious than other males i've been with in regards to the relationship itself. past boyfriends looked at me like a psychopath. now i'm the emotional one in the relationship, lol. my exes also liked to describe me as manly since i wasn't loving and was mainly concerned with sex. it made me feel detached and dominating."

Yet they all are fighting to be that ONE that can grow into a person. Almost parasitic-like, even a baby, how it feeds off the mother to live. Sperm are a living thing. And then u are born etc. But then on the other hand, because there’s evil in the world, we are susceptible to it. Everything is trying to kill us. Even in the womb. Even before, with sperm not making it through to the egg. People say life is what u make it. And that’s true to some extent. Now we can’t all be rich and wealthy but I do believe we can all be happy in some way. Trying to make the best of what’s killing us.

174366351,"Subtyping schizophrenia can be very tricky as there may be overlap in symptoms from one subtype to another. You could read about th DXM-V criteria for schizophrenia and see what they are, if you want to learn more about all this. Just google it. I have bipolar type 1, but I spend a ton of time psychotic, so, have much in common with people with schz. It has just been my experience, knowing a bunch of people with these illnesses over the years, that some are very open with their delusions, want to convince others they are true, etc., and others are not. I suppose the paranoid schizophrenic may be more inclined to the latter, but the experts here can say more on that much more reliably than me. Good luck to you and your dad.

I tried Lexapro 20mg for about 8 weeks and had another severe flare up 2 weeks ago. I went down to 10mg of Lexapro thinking it might have been too much, but now my psych thinks going back to Zoloft might be a good option. I’ve only been off Zoloft for about 2 months.

Prior, to the virus, were you able to get around people. Did you inherit your bi-polar from someone in your family? I inherited mine from my mother's mother. She was in an era, 30s, 40s, early 1950s, where they didn't have any medicine for bipolar. They didn't even have a diagnosis, it was lumped in with schizophrenia. She spent a lot of her adult life in a mental institution 100 miles from her house. They let her out one time to live with family members and she went to a downtown bar and got drunk, and they had to call her family members to pick her up. So we have a lot to be thankful for, medicines and whatnot, and not having to be in an institution but can stay at home. Prior to the virus, were you able to get out? Did socialization help? Was that about the time, also, that your mental illness started? Here's a joke: You can’t buy h
appiness, but you can buy cupcakes. And that’s kinda the same thing. Human beings only use ten percent of their brains. Ten percent! Can you imagine how much we could accomplish if we used the other sixty percent? _NAME_"
175973652,"_NAME_ good luck to you and know if there trying to shame you thats on them, youve done nothing to deserve it. Stay right in the eyes of God."
175973653,Have you tried outside at night? Very nice. Mostly quiet. Very still. Highly recommended. I'm very guilty lately of sleep-shifting to avoid human interaction.
174366395,Omg when I get back on real insurance I’m Totally going to try this....no weight gain!
175973654,Yes I’m taking citalopram but like you I have an appointment this Friday and I think I might need an increase. I started my med on 08-03 and I felt good within two weeks but after a few more weeks started feeling very anxious again. I had taking those same med five years ago
175973655,I’m not sure. I guess they are. We had them dripping and they still froze.
175973656,Do you have some resources when this happens? Such as calling suicide hotline just to chat with a counselor. DO you see a therapist you can share these concerns with so that you two can come up with a crisis/safety plan? What are some coping skills or distractions to take to get through the thoughts? I get it. I get them too. SOmetimes Im not even depressed!
175973657,In the beginning it’s was a little rough because the doctors try to find what medications works for you . So it’s like your just testing medication . If you feel like it’s not doing anything or feel side effects let your doctor know that it isn’t working and then they’ll help you look for the right one . I felt a little crazy too but I grew patience it’s not a fix all pill but to try to get you stabilize where it’s enough for you to be ok . If you any other thoughts I’m here but you are not alone hugs I hope you feel better
175973658,It’s like it’s getting harder to mentally stay healthy One step forward. Two steps back.
175973659,"My stomach has been ""off"" all day. I have to keep running for the bathroom. I don't think I'm sick. I'm worried I might have irritable bowel syndrome or something like that. I have a PCP appointment on Wednesday so I'm going to bring it up, because this is really annoying. Sorry if this is oversharing. =)"
175973660,"Our son was born with kidney trouble and he had only about 40 per cent kidney function. At about one or two months old they had to operate. So those were some tough times. He's now a 43 year old healthy adult. So it worked out OK. You've got some really good people working on this. If he has his health, I would think that was a good sign. I think you need to keep it together so you can follow doctor's orders and stay up with the situation."
175973661,"HI _PERSON_, Welcome to the forum. Do you get dizzy whenever you lay down, or just when you are falling asleep? I use to get dizzy when I laid down or turned over. Mine was sinus. Sinus problems gave me everything from dizziness to migraines. I hope you find out what is going on. Anxiety can cause plenty of different symptoms. Best wishes. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175973662,Idk whether to switch psychiatrists or not. I called another pdoc's office. Just don't know whether or not to make the appointment or not. My current psychiatrist does give me a lot of angst though for no reason.
175973663,"I see. I didn't mean to butt in, I'm sorry."
175973664,Yes she is
174366414,I am tired this morning. Just trying to wait for the sun to come up. I might get more sleep later in the day. My cat is on my side of the bed sleeping like a baby. I hate to wake her up.
175973665,"I took everything I have, including the fish oil."
175973666,I don't feel good right now. Spirits are telling me to hurt myself. DO IT DO IT DO IT... ****ing do it. Give them it... you're worthless piece of ****. Give them your blood give them all your blood... let them live again... they deserve life more than you. You are useless in life. Join us in the after life. Kill them all... go kill yourself.
175973667,Its storming out and I'm really happy about that! I love rain!
175973668,Happy New Year to all!!! We all have a lot to look forward to. Hopefully the end of covid and things getting back to somewhat normal. I guess it will be a new normal. Hugs to all. _NAME_...
175973669,"Thanks for sharing. You sound clear about wanting to talk to someone about your feelings. I sure understand that. The little money I have, after food, I invest in me.... I have a great therapist and she’s on a sliding scale fee, and she understood me pretty quickly and has been very helpful in teaching me skills when I get off center or my thoughts start running the show. I wish you the very best on your journey to uncovering your thoughts and fears, may you have more ease on your path. ?"
174366431,"so it's been 6 or 7 weeks since i quit my meds. BUT last night and today, after feeling generally feeling ok, i started having new symptoms of anxiety/impending doom/physically feeling #######5. i recognize these symptoms as being very similar to a few years ago when i was untreated. so i think my schizophrenia, to a limited extent, is back. im having no delusions which is good. im debating whether or not to go back on my meds. ###$ schizophrenia."
175973670,I haven't had psychosis since I started taking 5mg every night around 2-3 months ago. Helps me sleep too.
175973671,I have a couple 100mg seroquels. Maybe I can cut them in half.
175973672,"Provided there is nothing wrong with your throat (which you said you were going to get checked out) yes it is normal and common symptom of anxiety. It could be Globus hystericus which can range from feeling like something is stuck there to a lump sensation that never quite goes away. Again, provided there is nothing physically wrong it is just very annoying. Also if you have anxiety that your breathing pattern (short shallow breaths) is drying out your throat which doesn't help the sensation. Mine was brought on after cold/upper respiratory thing and gradually went away. Also my silent GERD was exacerbating it. Might want to get checked for GERD/Silent GERD as well. A third option could be tonsil stones which will work themselves out eventually. I don't think I have ever had these but an ENT could diagnose and flush/remove if necessary. I could drink hot or cold liquids but some people with GH might have difficulty with either or both. If that is the case drink room temp or lukewarm beverages. I wi
ll also note when I had it at its worst I could eat and swallow food just fine. It just FELT like something was caught there. According to internet research almost half the population will experience globus hystericus at some point so if there is nothing physically wrong then just be patient and it will resolve eventually. You have my empathy with how annoying and irritating it can be."
174366338,"This research material presents firsthand experiences of people who observed an unrecognized/unidentified phenomenon on Earth. This phenomenon gives false evidence supporting these delusions and can be recognized as synchronicities. The existence of these unique synchronicities goes back to the 17th/18th century. A researcher who critically analyzes these human experiences will understand that the cause behind these synchronicities is affecting the thoughts and actions of human beings in extremely complicated ways. Due to this nature, these unique synchronicities could easily make you believe that people know your thoughts, and they are indirectly referring to your thoughts and/or they indirectly talk about you. Therefore, these synchronicities are able to establish strongly held false beliefs in an observer's mind. A Brief Introduction: In my main research material, I stated that I observed a phenomenon that was not known to humanity prior I end up concluding that people know my thoughts. Source: 
The Deceptive Nature Of Synchronicities Sheds Light Into The Gangstalking Phenomenon, Schizophrenia, And Our Delusions! – The Ultimate Disclosure Of the Man-Made Phenomena! I observed this phenomenon again and again, and it provided me false evidence supporting the view that ""people know my thoughts."" In other words, at times, people actually reacted to my thoughts within seconds, and these reactions gave me convincing evidence for me to conclude that ""people know my thoughts."" But then again, at times, after I was thinking something, I observed a meaningful event which correlated with my thoughts a few minutes, a few hours or a few days later. These events gave me convincing evidence for me to conclude that ""people know my thoughts."" I faced an extremely high number of such synchronistic events (sometimes more than 15 cases per day). Therefore, these events cannot be considered as mere coincidences. Human thoughts and actions are getting affected due to an unknown reason to humanity. However, this do
es not mean that people know your actual thoughts. Once I managed to correct my false conclusions (delusions), I carried out extensive research, there I came to know that human beings around the world have been observing the same phenomenon. And they also have ended up concluding that ""people know my thoughts"" by observing the phenomenon. Once the false belief which is ""people know my thoughts"" have been established in human minds, some of them also have ended up concluding that ""my thoughts are broadcasting."" I came to an understanding that they have made this conclusion by trying to understand their observations. (For example, if so many people know my thoughts, then my thoughts could be broadcasting.) (Note that people who observe these synchronistic events will first start believing that people know my thoughts. Once this view is established in their minds, they would even claim that ""my thoughts are broadcasting"", ""people could read my mind"", ""I'm a telepathic"", ""my mind is a transmitter of 
thoughts"", I'm a psychic, I'm experiencing Artificial/Synthetic Telepathy developed by NSA/CIA/MI5, etc.) Therefore, these so-called unshakeable delusions are nothing more than erroneous conclusions. Dr. _NAME_ used the word ""synchronicity"" to explain meaningful coincidences/events in his book ""Synchronicity: An acausal connecting principle."" This phenomenon that human beings observe can be recognized as synchronicities or meaningful coincidences/events. Observing a high number of unique synchronicities is the cause behind these delusions. These synchronicities or meaningful coincidences/events can be recognized further as meaningful verbal and nonverbal events (synchronicities will fall under these two communication categories). The person who observes these meaningful verbal and nonverbal events will see clear correlations to his/her thoughts. Since these are independent events, but yet it occurs in such a way where the event will deliver a specific meaning to the observer(s), these events are synchron
icities. For example: While you are thinking of a particular movie, your friend who is next to you start talking about the same movie. Although the word synchronicity is used to explain meaningful coincidences or meaningful events, there's a huge difference between a true coincidence and a synchronicity or a synchronistic event. A true coincidence is an extremely rare event. However, synchronicities or synchronistic events are not rare. Sometimes you would experience 10, 15+ synchronicities during a day. Therefore, the driving force behind synchronistic events is not the same as true coincidences. When you experience such a high number of meaningful coincidences or meaningful events, then you would understand that you are facing synchronistic events and these are not true coincidences. For example, this individual is facing synchronicities, and these are not true coincidences: Source: Original Synchronicity Stories 1 This strange phenomenon could happen with live TV/Radio presenters, TV/Radio commercials, or 
even with TV shows. Assume you are reading something and that has the word ""key terms"" in it. By the time you read that unique text, you hear live TV presenter uses the same word at the exact moment or just seconds after that, in his spoken words. This timing activity could happen with TV commercials. By the time you are about to read the word ""key terms"" in the sentence, the right TV commercial also gets aired which has the word ""key terms"" in its script. Then by the time you read the word, the TV commercial also gets aligned in such a way, where you will get to hear TV commercial saying ""key terms"" at the exact moment of just seconds after that. This same thing could happen with TV shows as well. When you analyze these events deeply, you will understand that your thoughts and actions are being affected mysteriously. Further, according to Dr. _NAME_ survey, the most frequent coincidence was: - I think of an idea and hear or see it on the radio, TV or internet. (Out of 1500 people who has visited the 
site, 200 (13%) had taken the weird coincidence survey) Source: Weird Coincidence Survey Results - Connecting with Coincidence (Dr. _NAME_ is a visiting professor at the University of _NAME_ and a former chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Missouri-Colombia) When it comes to the delusions mentioned in this research material, the following are examples of meaningful verbal and nonverbal events or synchronistic events that you would observe: Verbal Events: Spoken words of a person(spoken words in a face to face conversation, TV/ Radio presenters speech, telephone conversations, etc.), written notes and emails, etc. An Individual would observe such an event by correlating to a thought that the individual had. For example: i). While you are thinking something, the person who stays next to you start talking about the same thing or would say something that would correlate with your thoughts. ii). The person who is next to you would write something, and that will correlate with your thoughts, 
or you receive an email where its title or body would show correlations to your thought. Nonverbal Events: Sudden Facial expressions (smiling, laughing, frowning, etc.), Sudden Gestures, Signs, Sudden Eye contacts, Sudden Behavioral changes, Paralinguistic events (ex: tone and loudness of spoken speech). For example: i). You got a negative thought in your mind about the person who is sitting next to you, and you observe that person suddenly look into your eyes and frown or move away from you. ii). While you are thinking of something, the person who is next to you say something in a sarcastic (voice tone) manner or that person would suddenly smile or laugh, and you see a clear correlation to your thought. How to understand if you are facing synchronicities and that your belief or conclusion is not true: I). You will observe a high number of meaningful coincidences/events. II). You will have to give so many references for your belief to another person when explaining the reasoning behind your conclusion. The me
dical community will consider these references as ideas of references and delusions of references. III). These events can be recognized as meaningful verbal & nonverbal events. Most of the time, it would be like people are indirectly referring to your thoughts / life events. IV). These observable events will make you believe that people know your thoughts / know you / know your life events. V). So many people will reject your claims, accusations, or your beliefs. VI). You will see that your conclusions are controversial yet these unusual events will still convince you. VII). Certain events can even make you think that your government, police officers, people in streets, corporations, your family members, friends etc. are conspiring against you / harassing you on purpose or even monitoring you. VIII). What you observe is not a normal human experience. IX). The medical community has recognized your claim as a delusion. If your experience shows the above characteristics, what you are observing is synchronicities
. People are not aware of your thoughts. Neither your thoughts are broadcasting. The cause behind synchronicities is actually affecting human thoughts and actions, and it will create meaningful events. These meaningful events would correlate with your thoughts. Therefore, these events will give you false evidence to make you believe that people know your thoughts. But in reality, your thoughts are not known by others, so they would reject your claim. These synchronicities or verbal and nonverbal events that correlate with our thoughts are being observed by people around the world who have these delusions. These so-called unshakeable delusions are nothing more than erroneous conclusions made by the observers of the phenomenon. To understand the below human experiences, you may assume that your thoughts are actually broadcasting. I). If so, do you think people would laugh at your thoughts? Will they smile? Will they get angry and show an angry face? Will they move away from you? Will they show a surprising look 
just because you had such a thought? - All these are meaningful nonverbal events or synchronicities that you would observe if your thoughts are actually broadcasting. II). Will they say something meaningful in replying to your thoughts? Will they repeat what you just thought? These are meaningful verbal events or synchronicities that you would observe if your thoughts are actually broadcasting. (By using the words ""Synchronistic Events / Synchronicities"" this material would refer to such meaningful verbal and nonverbal events. The observer will see these events always correlating to his/her thoughts when it occurs.) Human beings who claim that people know my thoughts/ my thoughts are broadcasting is observing a high number of such synchronistic events. This is what empirical observers of the phenomenon have to say: Case Study 1). This individual states: I). ""I used to think people could hear my thoughts, but that was because people would very often say something in response to what I had just thought. It u
sed to scare me a lot."" In other words, he/she observes human beings reacting to his/her thoughts in such a way where these reactions always show meaningful correlations to his/her thoughts; therefore, these are synchronistic events. A high number of synchronistic events as such has provided her false evidence supporting the false view that ""people know my thoughts."" (As mentioned earlier, assume your thoughts are actually broadcasting, if so what kind of possible reactions that you would observe from people? This line of thinking will help a researcher to understand these unusual experiences. Due to an unknown reason to humanity, only certain people in the world are facing these experiences. Therefore, it's hard to understand this phenomenon, if you have never experienced it. This is not an imagination & this is not a mental illness.) Source: Worry about people reading my mind - Social Anxiety Forum Case Study 2). I). ""it is very scary when everyone says stuff that is relevant to what your thinking."" Me
aning, the spoken words of people have correlated with his/her own thoughts. Even for this individual, these synchronistic events have been providing false evidence supporting the false belief, which is ""people know my thoughts."" Source: Worry about people reading my mind - Page 2 - Social Anxiety Forum Case Study 3). I). ""Oh I think something and I hear my dad and his gf talking thinking they're commenting on what I was thinking"". - The spoken words of Dad and his girlfriend has correlated with this individual's thoughts. Observing a high number of such synchronistic events is the cause behind the belief, which is ""people know my thoughts."" Case Study 4). I). ""We've excluded coincidence, like driving past a yellow signpost and both mentioning yellow"" - Which is a meaningful verbal event or a synchronicity. II). ""a new gym instructor. I told her I had spinal fractures and was thinking about the accident when I told her. She said ""from falling of a horse?"" - While she was thinking about her accident
, the gym instructor mentions what she was thinking just like she knew her thoughts. Which is again a meaningful verbal event or a synchronicity. III). She further states that ""I nodded, she (gym instructor) said ""you look like a horse person."" The gym instructor was giving references to the thoughts once again. Therefore, these are meaningful verbal events or synchronistic events. IV). She mentions this odd event to her husband, and she says: ""Anyway I got home and started to tell my husband. I told him she said, ""from falling off a horse"" to which he replied ""she said you look like a horse rider! Huh? I was stumped."" Which is another meaningful verbal event or a synchronicity, since she already heard these words from her gym instructor and now husband is referring to her thoughts/earlier events. Source: https://www.socialanxietysupport.com...06/index3.html Case Study 5). I). ""she actually looked at me when I was getting intrusive thoughts or thinking about her reading my mind""- She is referencing 
to a meaningful nonverbal event or a synchronicity that she observed. If you experience these events, it will quickly grab your attention since these events keep recurring. Therefore, it is not that people are finding patterns that are not there, people are stating what they observe and coming to a conclusion based on what they observe. By making false assumptions, they have ended up in false conclusions which we see as delusions.

I took melatonin, atenolol, zopiclone and olanzepine which knocked me out - Struggled to get out of bed this morning but managed to drink a coffee and make it there by 9am. I've never been late once in the two months that I've worked there! I worked 5 hours today - It was the busiest I've ever seen it today. I'll sleep in tomorrow until 11am and don't work until Friday. On Tuesday, I have an appointment with a new psychiatrist (The psychiatrist that I saw in the hospital was just an emergency psychiatrist). My mom is pissed because they can't just get me to see random psychiatrists all the time. I see my regular doctor on Wednesday to just check up and talk. So far I'm doing good. I'm still taking my meds as prescribed and have been off of phenibut and a
lprazolam for a week. I wrote down two things that I can do today - Which is learning about meditation and to read something.. Although I'm exhausted and worried that I'll get anxiety if I lie down because I've been standing up for so long."

175973701,"I read a study a few months ago which stated that high consumption of low ph drinks (soda) combined with caffeine, and also cns stimulating nicotine from cigarettes/vapes can reduce the efficacy of antipsychotics by up to 99%. Does this happen to any of you guys or is it just me? Can’t remember the link to the study, but if you search for it using ‘aps efficacy inefficient’ you may find it. I don’t get any extra pyramidal symptoms on aps due to cigarettes, vaping and coffee/coke/energy drinks. Let me know what you guys think."
175973702,"I will add some perspective of the astranged ""child"" ...I'm 48. I think it's likely difficult all the way around for everyone. Without knowing the catalyst or v specifics of either of your situations, it's hard for me to say something like, ""It's never too late."" But I do think parents are caught in a Catch 22 being fanned if they do reach out and rammed if they don't. I think the important thing to remember is, ""There's no winning and no prize for giving up."" To heal, effort must shown regardless of the immediate result. Broken trust and broken people don't mend without unyielding sacrifice of sincere effort without expectation ofv anything in return. Not accommodation or recognition of emotions or even acknowledgment that the hope to heal sorrow exists in the other's heart. The point I'm trying to make is forgiveness is not necessarily the end game. The end game is mastering the self-discipline to show your love as parents regardless of rejection, spite, rage, or disdain. If you as parents 
truly possess the love you profess to have for your children; it must be given over without the expectation of reciprocation. It must be without conditions, caveats, or fear of consequence. It must be given over to them in this way because it is your love that is in question. If one needs a return on their gestures, a validation of their sentiments, a proof of purchase if you will... then that really isn't lovev at all. It's self pity. And that's the last thing an astranged parent should want to project upon their child."

175973723,"THIS UN REPORT INCLUDE A DEFINITION OF “CYBERTORTURE” BY THE UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON TORTURE. On February 28, 2020, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Professor _PERSON_, issued his World Report on “Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” This report included a definition of “Cybertorture,” the Crime Against Humanity where millions of targeted victims worldwide are remotely assaulted with Electromagnetic Weapons in actions directed via computer, often from Supercomputers. (A/HRC/43/49) Cybertorture: 1. A particular area of concern, which does not appear to have received sufficient attention, is the possible use of various forms of information and communication technology (“cybertechnology”) for the purposes of torture. Although the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the internet has been repeatedly addressed by the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/32/L.20; A/HRC/38/L.10/Rev.1), torture has been understood primarily as a tool used to 
_USER_ID_ the exercise of the right to freedom of expression on the internet, and not as a violation of human rights that could be committed through the use of cybertechnology. 2. This seems surprising given that some of the characteristics of cyber-space make it an environment highly conducive to abuse and exploitation, most notably a vast power asymmetry, virtually guaranteed anonymity, and almost complete impunity. States, corporate actors and organized criminals not only have the capacity to conduct cyberoperations inflicting severe suffering on countless individuals, but may well decide to do so for any of the purposes of torture. It is therefore necessary to briefly explore, in a preliminary manner, the conceivability and basic contours of what could be described as “cybertorture”. 3. In practice, cybertechnology already plays the role of an “enabler” in the perpetration of both physical and psychological forms of torture, most notably through the collection and transmission of surveillance info
rmation and instructions to interrogators, through the dissemination of audio or video recordings of torture or murder for the purposes of intimidation, or even live streaming of child sexual abuse “on demand” of voyeuristic clients (A/HRC/28/56, para.71), and increasingly also through the remote control or manipulation of stun belts (A/72/178, para.51), medical implants and, conceivably, nanotechnological or neurotechnological devices.1 Cybertechnology can also be used to inflict, or contribute to, severe mental suffering while avoiding the conduit of the physical body, most notably through intimidation, harassment, surveillance, public shaming and defamation, as well as appropriation, deletion or manipulation of information. 4. The delivery of serious threats through anonymous phone calls has long been a widespread method of remotely inflicting fear. With the advent of the internet, State security services in particular have been reported to use cybertechnology, both in their own territory and abroad, f
or the systematic surveillance of a wide range of individuals and/or for direct interference with their unhindered access to cyber technology.2 Electronic communication services, social media platforms and search engines provide an ideal environment both for the anonymous delivery of targeted threats, sexual harassment and extortion and for the mass dissemination of intimidating, defamatory, degrading, deceptive or discriminatory narratives. 5. Individuals or groups systematically targeted by cybersurveillance and cyberharassment are generally left without any effective means of defence, escape, or self-protection and, at least in this respect, often find themselves in a situation of “powerlessness” comparable to physical custody. Depending on the circumstances, the physical absence and anonymity of the perpetrator may even exacerbate the victim’s emotions of helplessness, loss of control, and vulnerability, not unlike the stress-augmenting effect of blindfolding or hooding during physical torture. Like
wise, the generalized shame inflicted by public exposure, defamation and degradation can be just as traumatic as direct humiliation by perpetrators in a closed environment.3 As various studies on cyber-bullying have shown, already harassment in comparatively limited environments can expose targeted individuals to extremely elevated and prolonged levels of anxiety, stress, social isolation and depression, and significantly increases the risk of suicide.4 Arguably, therefore, much more systematic, government-sponsored threats and harassment delivered through cybertechnologies not only entail a situation of effective powerlessness, but may well inflict levels of anxiety, stress, shame and guilt amounting to “severe mental suffering” as required for a finding of torture.5 6. More generally, in order to ensure the adequate implementation of the prohibition of torture and related legal obligations in present and future circumstances, its interpretation should evolve in line with new challenges and capabilities 
arising in relation to emerging technologies not only in cyberspace, but also in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology and neurotechnology, or pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences, including so-called “human enhancement”. 1. _PERSON_, “Next-generation nonsurgical neurotechnology”, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, available at https://www.darpa.mil/program/next-g...eurotechnology 2 See Human Rights Council resolutions 32/13 and 38/7.

But like extremely light autism.. I watched _NAME_ in Wonderland. Damn what a dreamy movie.. And the thing is, I had a childhood friend talk to me on the phone for the first time since we went apart when we were kids and he said ""Are you ok?"" and I said ""Yes.. are you ok?"" and he said ""Yes, but are you really?"". We stopped talking after that phone call. Before that, he told me that he was in the psych ward for depression and psychosis. It was cold and I felt like I was having a dissociative flashback. We said we would text but he didn't reply or maybe see the messages.. I sent him an _NAME_ in Wonderland quote about how we're all mad... He then replied.. My dad is just like me. He says things that would make me think really deep about things he says things like ""You're not crazy"" and ""Don't go mad"". It's 
all nuts. And I walk into my room every day and my cat is just sitting there.. She hasn't been the same since my bad trip.. Always scared.. And if I do let my thoughts go, I can go ""crazy"" and everyone tries to calm me down. This coronavirus thing doesn't help.

As far as supplements not working...I know the fish oil works for me, I couldn’t remember where I parked my car or other things like an assignment from two days ago or even two hours until I started taking it. My focus improved dramatically....I could read novels again. It was the only thing I changed. N=1 Also I know my mom took the AERDS vitamins for her eyes due to macular....studies show it helps.

Understanding the link between your diagnoses and alcohol may be explained a bit better by reading at this link _PERSON_. It DOESN'T however say anything about smoking ""weed"" however that has the same effects on the bran ultimately. Much more research needs to be done and I'm sure ultimately it will be published.

But! Know this I love you EXACTLY as you are ALWAYS! Sassy Linking bipolar disorder and alcohol use disorder Researchers haven’t identified a clear link between bipolar disorder and AUD, but there are some possibilities. Some theorize that when AUD appears first, it 
can trigger bipolar disorder. There’s no hard scientific evidence for this idea, though. Other theories suggest that people with bipolar disorder turn to alcohol in an attempt to quiet their symptoms, especially manic symptoms. Another explanation for the connection is that people with bipolar disorder exhibit reckless behavior, and AUD is consistent with this type of behavior. If you have both conditions, it matters which condition appears first. People who receive a diagnosis of AUD may recover faster than people who first receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. On the other hand, people who receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder first are more likely to have difficulty with the symptoms of AUD."

I told my mom but she didn't believe me and says it's all in my head. I'm not really scared of dying anymore. I just told her casually and she said to sleep in her bed - She checked my pulse and it was strong and fine. I wasn't scared that my heart stopped. I knew this was going to happen one day. I must have have syncope or just fell asleep with a heart palp. So I'm gonna keep taking the Vyvanse but I'll go get another ECG. I'll get an echocardiogram too (I've never had one of those).

It literally sat inside my dresser for a year before I actually gave it a chance. But I got it because I was waiting for pokemon to come out. Lo and behold I finished my first video game from start to finish in over 10 years. Actually probably wayyy longer cuz I started giving up when I was 15.

This is progress...even if it isn't everyday that you feel better...there will be more good days and less and less challenging ones as you progress. You may not get relief from the sleep issues until you reach your therapeutic dose, and stay at that level until your system adjusts to it. Until then, every increase may bring a disruption to what your body has become used to. Since the risk of dependency is worrying you, why don't you ask your doctor about the possibility of switching from Klonopin to Vistaril. (hydroxyzine) This Rx level antihistamine works similarly to a benzo, without any risk for addiction or tolerance. It does make one feel drowsy and relaxed and may be just what you need to get the rest you seek...? Worth talking about anyway! Peace, progress and keep us updated! S.C."

Today I do not think I took my 75 mg at 1pm, but I am not certain. I was distracted. Pretty sure I did not take it but not 100% sure. When I realized that, at 4pm, I took 50 mg, and then I will take another 25 mg at 9pm, as usual. So if I did not take the first dose, I will end up short 25 mg today. If I did, I will end up ""over"" by 50 mg today. I think the former is much more likely. I guess that approach is OK. Any thoughts?

Figured out water gotten inside them. Freaked the **** out because I am terrified of ear infections and therefore-meningitis. I just came back home and cleaned my ears with a q tip and THERE WAS A BIT OF PINK DYE ON IT. It wasn't much and it was diluted (obviously) but still... So I guess hair dye has gotten inside my ears as well...I am very scared. Am I going to die? What if it gets inside my brain? What if it gets into my inner ear and then my brain and I get meningitis? I tried to do everything to get the stuff out but it's not working. There's no pain, my ears just feel a bit full and there's a tiny discomfort, I can't really call it pain.. Please help me.. I have never dealt with such a thing. I also don't know why I got so dizzy. Maybe because I didn't eat at all before swimming? I went to the beach around 5 in the afterno

175116609,I want to thank you for the links Miss _PERSON_. I read through both articles and agree one way to combat the horrors of covid each day is to balance bad new with uplifting good news. Also outrage exhaustion is a real issue especially for me. I absolutely push myself into a corner with both covid and my pain levels. I know many people prefer to wait on the covid vaccine but not me. I already take flu and pneumonia shots each year plus about a dozen other shots for my medical issues. Knowing the covid vaccine is out there makes me feel better. What upsets me is the wait time to get the shot. I agree nursing home and medical people should have first priority. I hope maybe next month I can get this taken care of. Thanks and my prayers are with you all
175973865,"R., Fantastic question! And the fact that you recognize the problem and are seeking to work towards fixing the issue is half the battle won! Repeating positive mantras whenever you feel the negative thoughts taking hold really works to not only help change our thinking patterns, but with time to actually make a physical improvement in our brain chemistry! You don't even need to fully believe the statements you are keeping in your inner monologue/self talk...I didn't at first, but I kept at it... ...with continued practice went from being a negative thinker to a positive one! Therapy Worksheets can also be a powerful tool in de-fusing negative/worrisome thoughts. Find info for using Positive Mantras, and downloads of Therapy Worksheets in our Resources.

Is it as simple as that part of you not believing you're worthy of having good things in life? I know a part of you does want and works toward having good things. Or possibly, is that part of you uncomfortable with having things going too good? When people look up to you, does it make you feel uncomfortable?

175279378,"Hi zehra, There are so many things that are mysterious... You have had some important tests that likely rule out many things, but understand that tests arre not always full proof, things, important things, can be and often are missed or misinterpreted or not caught. I had what at a certain time was the most ""thorough"" bloodwork. They missed a genetic predisposition towards a hypercoagualative blood condition. I also went in prior to my shortness of breath, they misdiagnosed me with asthma. I suffered a DVT with multiple PEs landing me in ICU fighting for my life for a couple weeks and remain disabled. So if you're not getting satisfactory answers, I would recommend not only switching physicians, but registering at a completely new hospital. I think a new blood workup including a check for genetic irregularities along with a screen for Covid-19 (again if you did already), plus other big scaries like MS, Lupus etc. and lesser big scaries like Limes etc. would all be worthwhile endeavors to investig
ate. To me the shortness of breath sounds most concerning. There are a number of possible causes. EKGs won't tell you much although they may take one. I think a reputable pulmonologist might be your best starting point to discuss a CT and chances are they'll recommend one. Additionally a vascular specialist and/or neurologist would also both be high on my list. They could run some Dopplers or Neurological scans to catch clots in your extremities or other disorders related to their specialties that could present pain that is not always so obvious. Start with a new primary physician if you're going to switch hospitals avid try to go in with a strategy by doing the research on who you want to consult. If you can keep all your physicians within the same hospital and insurance network, this will make assembling a care team that is familiar with each other's own hospital and getting referrals much easier and allow them to communicate with each other much easier. it is so unnerving to not receive answers after going 
through so much already. This I understand, but your health is priority #1 and if you're not getting any clarity on how to diagnose and approach what's wrong, then it's time to find the professionals who can provide you with some real answers and not run you through a gauntlet of tests yielding no clues, which simply put is unacceptable. Time to take charge of b your own care and course of actions. Study all your various ailments and document it for yourself. Keep all your tests and contacts organized so that future physicians will have comparative reference points. Keep a regular sleep routine if possible. Try to keep your anxiety as low as possible. Stress can cause pain. Keep asking questions, questions, questions here in Inspire, to physicians, to family, andv friends. This is your team. You are not alone, and eventually you will start to get some answers that paint a clearer picture for yourself. Strength and healing, - cres"

I went to the doctor and the said I have low T 270, went again in the morning he said it was normal range. Now I'm 30 and it has suddenly struck again but this time it's been 5 months. I noticed that it wasn't mental because no morning _PERSON_ to the doctor it was 172 and I had my first injection a week ago. He doesn't seem to want, know, or care what the original cause is. I have been very, very, very active my whole life and this is gradually sudden. Any input is welcome, but my actual question is this; The injection peaks at 3 days and wears off over the next 2 weeks, then I take another every 2 weeks. Does it bring you let's say to 172 to 250 or 172 to 500? When it wears down does it bring u back to your original or doe

But as you said, breaks are good. I want to be in the right mind state all the time - I'm just trying to survive at this point. I like to have ""fun"" less often now when I should. But life is ok..

175973914,"I've been watching the Monogatari series (the complete sequence is a confusing mess, but Bakemonogatari is the starting point). It's... a very mixed bag, but it seems to be like that on purpose. Figuring out what you even think or feel about it is kind of a process. It's part of what makes it memorable. At one point I ""rage quit"" watching it, but then I went back to it, and I think I'll even end up rewatching the whole thing at some point, which is something I never do. I saw the latest season of Black Mirror recently-ish. Not terribly bad (apart from the last episode, which is actually bad), but still disappointing, especially compared to the other seasons so far. I remember someone recommended it to me some time ago, but I don't remember why I decided not to watch it (or if I simply forgot about it). I guess I'll give it a try. Any other TV series you'd recommend that don't revolve around crime and criminals? That ""something"" is: it's bad. Don't bother. The gazillions of people who did bother 
watching it through the end regret doing so."

Nash noticed it too, i think a lot of his work was in essence an attempt at articulating this “thing” in many ways. but yes, i notice this thing about reality every so often when i have a profound insight about something. there is an irony about the religious and hardline atheists at play, well there are several ironies ... at least in my opinion. an interpretation of reality while amazing for creativity and has incredible value, is in the end ultimately subjective ... and has a dark side."

Right at the time when I needed some stability. These meds plus the Abilify and Effexor and Remeron. I know it is a lot of meds, but it is the combo that works for me. I mean, that's the best.

175973995,"I don’t know what kind of topic It is, I don’t really know why I’m writing this, I guess I just need someone to listen or read. When I was 13 years old I saw my mother, she was trying to jump off a building but my dad stopped her. At this age I really didn’t know how to react or do. The next day, everything became more sane and normal, everyone acted like nothing happened. I can still remember my brother screaming to her “ mom your daughter is crying, stop”. A year passed, everything seemed normal. But that day came again. I was then 14, I came back from school, my dad picked me up at school, we were in traffic and he started crying and saying sorry, he told me he cheated on my mom and that at home things were complicated. For several months me and my brother had dinner alone. My school was the only place I could be sort of happy. I was that kid who made everyone laugh and smile but when I got back home It was like the 2WW, at least it’s how I felt it. In some way, I don’t know how, 
they stayed together. They stayed together but conflicts between them were still here. I still remember those nights where she tried to jump out of the car or when she cut her hair. I still remember those screams upstairs and I would always fear of what she would do afterwards. When I went through my last year of high school, all I wanted was to study far away from my home because in a way I felt like I became my dad’s psychologist, he would always come and talk to me about how he felt but never how I felt, he felt sorry to put me trough such situations. My dad was the best father that any one could have but the worst partner in a relationship. My dad was the one who educated me, he made sure that I had everything I needed, he made me feel loved, I learned a lot from him. However, there was one thing missing, my mom wasn’t always there for me. At some point I’ve gain weight and she would always tell me to go run or do something. Don’t get me wrong, I was doing a sport every Wednesday, it wasn’t enou
gh for her. I knew and still do have a better connection or felt closer to my dad. When we had those father and daughter time, I felt very good but disturbed that I didn’t have the same relations with my mom. It might also be caused by the fact that me and my mom couldn’t have a great conversation. With time and years, I’ve grown and the topic of my conversation became more philosophical If we can call it so. She never went trough middle school, she didn’t have the privilege to go to school like I did or my father did. She doesn’t see herself with an other man than my dad. They’ve been married for 21 years. Deep in me, I knew that if my dad stayed with my mom is because he’s also scare of what she could do if he leaves her. I also knew at that time that he was still seeing other women without her knowledge. Before I went to university, like 4 years before, I would be having dinner on my own for some nights because my brother went to college. In a way, I felt very alone but mad at myself for feel
ing sad because I did have everything I wanted and I guess I was thinking that I shouldn’t feel this way because other people could be in a more crisis situation. I lived in a broken family but I was living under a house with food and everything to succeed in school. I would be lying if I said that I didn’t have the thought of suiciding myself at 16. It was only thoughts because I wouldn’t have had the courage to take away something that someone else would want it. I felt stuck in myself, trapped. When I had to leave for university, my parents and I flew to visit some family before. I remember them having an argument on what song to put on the radio, we were heading to see my aunt : we didn’t go. We stayed at the hotel, I still remember her saying she wanted to died, I saw her go on the balcony, she took a chair and was about to jump, my dad got her in time. Now, I’m 19, everything got better, my mom isn’t trying to do things, I’m 20 hours away by plane from my home. I feel kinda relieve that I
m away, I still love them both and still miss them a lot but I do feel sad From times to times like a weight on my shoulder. Thank you for anyone who read or listened."

175973999,"Went to my doctor today shared about what I feel and about my brother who passed away with mass in the brain. Well he told me to do the blood test, it came out normal. Then he check my nose,my eyes,my ears and my mouth. When he touch deep my gums below my tongue it’s sore and he said it’s tender too, so probably the the cause why I have a swollen neck and it’s a lymph nodes, I ask why when I take a deep breath it’s connected to my brain he explain to me like the nerves pushes or working hard to fight the infection. He wants me to go to my dentist and if it’s not going to be okay he will request for a ct scan. I really want to make sure about the tumor in the brain. And btw, he told me to give time for the Zoloft. If it’s still the same he will give me a higher dose. But I told him that my sleeping if great now when I started taking it. But my anxiety like aching in my brain and nervousness still there. As he said Give it a time. I have a follow up appointment with him on January 7. Hope
fully everything’s gonna be okay. I’m praying for it."

175974001,"Using empirical research drawn from field studies on the policing of 'skid row' communities, this paper illustrates some of the theoretical, methodological and ethical problems that confront the researcher who studies surveillance and counter-surveillance within these contested settings. We begin by noting how, with the increasing use of the 'broken windows' policing model to regulate deviant individuals and to secure derelict urban spaces, researchers may be implicated in the use of surveillance and counter-surveillance by community stakeholders. Drawing examples from direct and covert field observations, field notes, and photographs, we demonstrate that there is a significant potential for the researcher to become identified as an agent of surveillance, and as a potential target of counter-surveillance, within such settings. We conclude by considering some of the theoretical, methodological and ethical implications of the researcher's complicity in these dynamics for both the conduct of surveilla
nce studies in general, and for urban fieldwork in particular. (PDF) Observing the Observers: Researching Surveillance and Counter-Surveillance on 'Skid Row"

I still have my job and am able to work from home. And we have plenty of food and are healthy. But my anxiety remains a significant impediment to my enjoyment of life. I increased my medication dose and felt better for a couple of weeks thereafter, but now it is pretty much back to where it was. It is worst in the mornings, as it is for many people. Meditation helps somewhat (but not enough). The past 10 months or so have been hard. I don't know what to do to make it better. Maybe this is just my new normal and I will have to live with it.

174366883,"My mom wanted me to watch an awareness for schizophrenia thing on TV and the doctor was talking about negative symptoms and how they're working on medications to treat them. He was saying how _NAME_ has a lot of money for mental illness and I'm in the best place in Canada for treating people in their 20's and educating families on psychosis. He also talked about depot injections because people aren't compliant with medications. My mom was like ""If the meds didn't work, you'd think I was showing you this as a conspiracy to take your injection"". She right cuz right now I didn't even think of that cuz I have zero psychotic symptoms. Interesting how I trust my own judgement so much and don't even notice when I don't but now I do. When I'm paranoid but not delusional, I notice and just joke about things that like cuz of my sense of humour. Success! I hope they find drugs for negative symptoms :/ I'm looking forward to trying roluperidone. I think I can take it with the paliperidone idk. No one cares a
bout negative symptoms tho and just thinks we're lazy. But I talk about them a lot cuz I had pretty severe negative symptoms although they have gotten better. I remember knowing what anhedonia was before anyone did and there was only one forum post on the internet of some guy posting on it for two years, trying everything to help him with anhedonia. Although I'm a bit weird cuz I'm very interested in psychedelics. It's a curse."

175974022,Hello everyone!!! im 13 years old and I cant stop swalloing every 5 seconds. this situation started happening like 3 months ago and its really emberassing. it mostly happens whenever im at school. I tried stoping it or distracting myself but the more I do that the more I want to keep swalloing. every time i sit next to someone i want to swallow and when i swallow i feel like they can hear me its very uncomfterable. I thought chewing gum will help me overcome it but it made it even worse. whenever i chew gum the flavor comes out and it makes me want to swallow it badly. I tried drinking alot of water to see if that helps and it only helped a little. but now when i drink water i feel like people hear me swallow it and its very uncomfortable like really uncomfortable. sometimes I even wonder if my classmates are thinking that im a weird and disgusting since i swallow my salavia alot. can anyone give me some suggestions please i dont want to have this situation anymore.

But then people like psychiatrists and even my therapist convince me that I need the meds and that it's irresponsible to my health to go off the meds. Like it's their responsibility! I just think it's unbelievable that others have to take responsibility for others' health in this society. I wonder why sometimes. Why ought we trust doctors with our own personal health? I honestly do not know. I know doctors can do wonders for some people but sometimes I wonder if it's all a bunch of hogwash. I just don't know how they're so good at convincing me that I need the meds! Almost as if it's their job to convince people. But if I opt out, then am I a member of some underground cult or something like that? I don't understand. It just goes past my understanding that I need some sort of drug to correct something in my brain. It's just so far-fetched, you know. Ugh. I just wish th

175974071,"Hi _PERSON_. I am interested in your situation because I too am about to start the process of weaning off of Zoloft. I began at 25mg and have slowly increased to 150 mg, where I have been for the past 9 weeks or so. I am taking it because of anxiety (probably some combination of GAD and OCD) and an event that occurred about 10 months ago that caused me a major anxiety attack. I had troubling side effects when I first began the zoloft. It messed with my sleep. I needed meds to help me fall asleep at the beginning. Also, I would wake up very early in the morning and feel super-agitated. The agitation would not subside until I went out for a run. So, at 5 or 530 am, I was out the door to run. Not fun! But I stuck with it and the high agitation and sleeping difficulty mostly went away. I was lucky that I did not experience weight gain. But I really don't want to be on SSRI or any other meds for the long term. So I am going to try to go off of it. My doc says I could take benzos as needed. I don't want 
to do much of that either, but I guess a small dose on rare occasions. My taper plan for the Zoloft is 25 mg reduction every two weeks. I can always stop reducing or go up if I feel bad. My doc basically said ""do whatever feels right."" So, we will see. Let us know how your taper goes. Thanks!Post Edited (medved) : 5/20/2020 10:35:11 AM (GMT-6)"

But I guess I’m inclined to stay w 50 mg for another 4-6 weeks and see how it goes. I know lots of people have to try multiple meds before they find the right one - if they ever do.

174366975,Nvm what I wrote was meaningless. My therapist is just saying that I'm doubting the schizophrenia diagnosis and I'm not. I'm saying I also have a very light form of autism. That doesnt mean that i need to be on all or nothing high dose of antipsychotic or nothing. I just need to lower the dose like SP and stay on that dose to prevent further psychosis. I should have known this years ago. The abilify wasnt working for me so she put me on the max dose of invega. That's not my fault. My psychiatrist only did that because I was having derealization and depersonalization which I never knew would cause panic attacks and I thought it was psychosis because it reminded me of the bad trip which was different than my psychosis I had at 16 (A meth like psychosis with paranoia) Idk

175974097,"I'm not going to play doctor because that's not allowed on this forum but why does your doctor think that you need clozapine? It seems like your symptoms (psychotic ones) are under control. Clozapine is helpful for those who don't respond to other antipsychotics and/or those who are Possible trigger: struggling a lot with suicide attempts, etc. I guess I don't necessarily get the logic behind that. Plus you have to get a bunch of blood draws and that's a pain, etc. I'm not discouraging you from going on it nor am I for going on it either.

175974104,"I didn't really read the whole thing, but I wanted to respond because I think this is what SPD is actually about. People tend to focus on the reclusiveness, but that's just what characterizes it, not what makes it a disorder. Anhedonia and avolition (sides of the same coin) are the issue. I searched for the word ""sleep"", and there it is: Yes. It should be a top priority. The other thing I also wanted to mention is regular physical activity. For one thing, it's intertwined with sleep quality. But there's also all the consistent and well-documented mental effects. And you don't need to look as deep as scientific research, the principle is simple: if you exercise regularly, you get tired regularly (and at the same time, you get a ""rush"", because of endorphins and whatnot), then the simple act of resting becomes a meaningful and enjoyable activity. In other words, it gives meaning to the ""doing nothing"" you're already used to. And then, once you're well-rested (which may take a while if you're no
t used to physical activity), the more lasting (but often also immediate) effect of exercise is your mind gets more active, then it becomes actually uncomfortable to be doing nothing. So you go ahead and do something. Doesn't matter what it is, just do it, and then follow from there. Or maybe stay aimless forever, at least you'll be distracting yourself from the fundamental meaningless of existence (is there anything else to life anyway?). I think the reason why people tend to fail when they try to address the issue of meaningless and lack of motivation is that the natural (and culturally promoted) way to go about it is to ""figure out what is the meaning/purpose of life"" (or the meaning/purpose of your own life at least), as if meaninglessness is curable. It isn't though. There is no meaning or purpose, there is only the illusion. And if you can't acquire and sustain the illusion naturally (most people do it by ""social osmosis""), then the best you can do is deliberately maintain the illusion yourself, aga
inst your own knowledge. So sooner or later, to make real progress, I think you need to come to terms with the fact that this isn't an issue to be overcome so you can move on with your life (as therapists tend to approach it), it is your life."

175974116,"Hello! So I have been with a wonderful man for almost a year. He has made me feel loved, wanted, and respected. He has never given me any indication he is cheating on me and often reassures me he loves me. However, I have been in a pretty toxic relationship a few years ago that really messed me up for lack of better words. I often feel when he is quiet he is mad or upset with me. When I ask about staying with him at his house sometimes he will pause to think. I tend to get upset as I think he doesn't want me there. In the end we always end up making time for each other. He has thoroughly met my family and they adore him as much as I do. I have bonded with his family as well. He recently ask me to move in and I asked him if he was really committed and wanted to marry me one day. He needed time to think and now he wants to visit a friend (who happens to be a woman but is not interested in men if you know what I mean) next week without me. Do I let it go and wonder if he needs time to talk about what 
he wants with a friend? How do I accept his answer if he never wants to marry me? I am so in love with him and the thought of living without him hurts more than words can describe. How do I get a handle on my own anxieties and insecurities before it tears us apart?"

175974118,"I'm not sure if he hears voices anymore. He did. But it was very hard for him to explain to me what the voices were like and I know he's not outright chatting to himself (or the voices). I know he is in his head though, as he has told me he is talking in his head. His med dosage was increased, hopefully that will help. I too believe it is mania. I definitely see him getting restless, VERY restless, and h needs a break so he just goes. Like you said, Under*Over, he just needs to get out. I do care and worry about him, especially after a certain amount of time, and it something I don't think I can keep going through as it causes such anxiety for me and I have my own mental health issues. I know it's not about me or against me or anything but it is extremely hard to live with. Perhaps if he didn't have someone freaking out when he's gone for 24 hours it would be easier for him to return home."

There is likely a very good reason almost all Buddhists are exceptionally happy like 96.836% of the time. They have much figured out about how to successfully operate on planet earth, in my humble view."

I remember the first time I smoked weed - It was also a manic laughter and I had a 'white out'. I had to write down on my hand what to get from the car, kept forgetting the keys... Then the next day, I was extremely paranoid but denied/didn't accept that I was and that I could handle it. After being anhedonic for so long, I actually enjoy feeling intense sadness/depression.. It's weird to the regular person. I think the reason I enjoy feeling down sometimes is the reason that it's hard for me to be clinically depressed. _AT_MENTION_ question, I think the brain does work like that.. But also, I think that the brain can handle a loooot of suffering - I think it might thrive on suffering.. As you said like the fear being a good motivator.

I got him proper winter clothes, he thanked me profusely. He made it through that awful cold.

I basically keep being paranoid that I've had an encounter with a bat that I didn't really notice. I'll be outside and see a swoosh in the corner of my eye and then think that I feel something on my leg and I'll be sure that a bat got me. I've been dealing with it, each time trying to convince myself that I'm just being paranoid but a few days ago, I woke up with a jolt. I felt like there was a poke on my finger so I worried that a bat had bit me while I was sleeping. I've read a lot of stories about people who get bit by bats while sleeping and they don't realize it because the bites are so small and then they die from rabies. I tried to stay calm but in the morning I saw that there was a little black speck on my finger like a small scab so now I feel like I really must have been bit because what are the odds that I wasn't and there just hap
pened to be a black speck in the same spot where a felt a poke. I'm freaking out and want to get a rabies shot but its expensive. I don't know what to do.

I mean the amount of support and level of understanding people have,......it gets me right here (hand on heart),...... .......Ohhhhh no. If you believed that last part then HAHA,...and can I come live at your place? My name really is _NAME_,.... most of the time. I really do suffer from the above mentioned DID (((Split Persa,....blah blah blar))). By suffer I mean, it's bitter sweet. It comes with it's rewards along side the struggles. Lets ask: If I could wander back to any age prior to 40 and prevent myself from discovering this disorder, ultimately preventing the pain, solitude and confusion that I have experienced since,.......would I? The answer would be, ....""Maybe,......No I probably better just keep kic
king my own ass in the direction I've been going. Thanks though."" It really is tempting. Life was easier but ""I"" didn't exist. At least I didn't feel that way. The following period of time on the ""_NAME_ Time Line"", although filled with juicy details, must at last be reduced to outline and abbreviated by bullet point,....for you the reader if you are still following this ""poop"". Wouldn't want to bore anybody! * May 5, 2019. Cinco De Mayo. All of Mexico celebrates my birth, as they do every year. I reach the peak. Middle age comes with slap! 40 years in the bag. * August, Dad gets cancer in his pancreas. He has been incarcerated for years in the State Pen and Country Club for not keeping his hands to himself, especially in the presence of children. * First week in September, he dies. * Second week in September, I lose the job I love. I start using drugs. Meth to be exact. Now I must make a note here. During this same time I am also a great dad to two little girls ages 9 and 6. I get my kids to school, I 
meet their needs as much as possible along with my mother, age 81, who's home we live in, and the girls mother who is still part of our lives but resides elsewhere. But, what i want to point out here is the pattern of self sabotage. * Depression of course. * Addiction exposed,......and continues. * The thought of ending it becomes more than just a thought, but a solution. Not just to my problem but to my whole family and their future. * January 31. I make the decision to kill myself. Yes, that is my final answer _PERSON_. * That same night,.... I know I can't just do it and not have a reason. My kids and my family would surely blame themselves. So I come up with the idea to blame it on a horrible mental illness. I remembered back to a time, a councilor I once had mentioned that my past reflects those with split personality. She said I fit the bill. That to me was about as scary as anything I could think of. The obituary would read ""He finally lost his battle with mental illness last Tuesday"" instead of ""He 
did it for his family"". I am a good actor. I was in drama. Hey _PERSON_! I read for about 20 minutes and the world changed. The article I read could have been titled, ""_NAME_ hold the _PERSON_"". I even found an online test. A score of 30 meant reason for concern. I scored a 79. I didn't find an excuse or reason not to go on, but an answer to all the holes in my personality. First I think I imploded. Then I exploded. When the dust settled I looked up and found out I'm not alone in here, I also discovered, on the topic of suicide, I had been out-voted. * February 1, Not suicidal. Every day since has been a ride. Up Down Up Down Up down. I'm excited for the future. I have hope. I need treatment. Covid 19 had to come up around the same time and complicate it even more. I'm looking now for in-house therapy.

175974242,"Yes, that's all too true. I haven't experienced such a loss in my life, so I wouldn't know exactly how raw and emotional I would feel. I don't want to sound too gloomy, but if you don't reach out for support and get the help you need, these 'symptoms' (if you'd call it that) will continue to worsen. If you're not comfortable getting professional help, please continue to use Inspire, and I'd suggest to do things that you enjoy - things that ease this tension you're feeling, make you reflect on it, or to distract temporarily from these emotions. I'm not sure what sort of things you'd be interested in, but make a list... things like: journaling, exercising, reading, praying for help in this, for guidance and understanding, etc. (if you're spiritual), swimming, going to the beach/lake - my favorite!, meditation, yoga, getting a massage, calming/soothing instrumentals, watch a funny movie, listen to your favorite music... just to name a few. They won't 'fix' how you're feeling, but if you put effort int
o the activities on your list (not just doing them to get the job done), you'll feel better - even if it's just a fraction of a percent. Another thing you could try and I'm kind of a newbie at it... mindfulness. Basically when you have such a wave of emotions, feelings, and thoughts, step outside of yourself and look in on yourself - from an outside person's point of view. State facts, no emotions attached to the facts. You can see you are in emotional pain. That it's putting stress on your body, you can't work your best, etc. Basically you acknowledge these things without judgement, and don't let it affect how you feel. I sometimes even say it out loud. As an example... For me: I am depressed. I have an eating disorder. I have anxiety. I have pain in my body. I'm not happy. I don't sleep well. I have a lot of stress... While I'm acknowledging these negative things, as soon as I say them, it feels like a burden is lifted off my shoulders, and there's added clarity to my life. I have no idea why... or if it'll 
work for you! Hope this helps... Thanks for reaching out. You are not alone!"

It was probably an article trying to scare people. But I have seen it abused, well not the action per say, but the person taking them. But I think that person abused Xanax too. I think because you and I use for anxiety, we don't get the ""high"". I can't even picture anybody getting high off of Xanax. I guess because it doesn't do that for me. If I took too much I would just fall asleep. Yeah, Xanax is only about four hours. Though I only take twice a day. I too saw medication abuse at a young age so I am careful. Especially because it was my family so I figured I would inherit the gene. If I spelled that right. I don't think Xanax helps much with muscles. It doesn't seem to for me. I thought about asking for a switch to valium, as it does relax the muscles. I have never taken klonopin so I didn't realize it would 
relax the muscles. I use to take soma for muscle relaxer but I don't anymore. I doubt they would prescribe it as it is another one that is abused. It is too bad people abuse the medications as it makes it harder for people who do need it. Oh well, such is life I guess. _PERSON_, I hope you have an anxiety free holiday. I will be glad when it is over actually. Not that I don't like it but I will be more relaxed I think. Have a good one. Hugs, _NAME_..."

It is used by many therapists to see where their patients are on the depression scale. You do sound depressed but there is a difference between situational depression and chemical imbalance depression. Because of Covid and your being stuck at home it may be situational for you and go away as the world opens up. One thing I noticed is that you have made plans for the future riding that roller coaster and living life to the fullest.... that is a good sign that you are not giving up. Keep going... things will get better but wouldn’t hurt to go see your family Dr to tell them how you are feeling. Sometimes just talking about my depression made me feel a bit better.

175974282,"I've been dealing with psychiatric issues for most of my life. Hence, I decided to go into therapy years ago. And I elected to see psychiatrists at the same time in order to get on helpful psychiatric medication. When I first went into therapy, the medication I was on wasn't working. And that was a big reason why the talk therapy wasn't working. By not being on the right meds, I was too depressed to believe in much of anything positive any counselor had to say. Also, I was too anxious to be able to be calmed down with psychotherapy. So was the therapy I received at that time a big waste of time since it wasn't calming me down and wasn't making me feel more optimistic? Actually, no. The thing is, once I got on medication that actually helped me a lot with my depression and anxiety, I remembered the advice the therapists had given me beforehand. And since I was feeling happier and much calmer, I was able to finally believe in the positive advice that I had received beforehand. Hence, I started feelin
g even better. So if you're feeling bad emotionally and find talk therapy so far to be unhelpful because you're not on the right pill(s) and you're feeling too lousy to believe in much of anything good any therapist has to say, chances are the therapy you've already received hasn't been a waste of time. It certainly wasn't a waste of time for me in the long run."

In first month when I almost went through with it, my dad found me before I could do it and talked me out of it. I didn’t have the knife out yet so he didn’t see, and now he talks about like it’s a joke. It wasn’t as bad in the beginning, but I can’t stop thinking about ending my life. I have pills in my room, but I really don’t want to die. I wish I could live, but it feels like I have to do it for my family. It hurts all the time like a have something squeezing my chest, and this feels like the only way to get out. If there’s any other option I could take, I would, but I feel empty.

Here is another example that may explain my experiences better: An angel carving I had suddenly became wavy and stood out, almost like a twinkling star (the aura I described earlier). I was immediately drawn to it, since it felt like God was directly communicating with me. Thoughts can definitely be visual. I've had distorted thinking that felt real in the moment, but it was more of a belief than actually seeing an object that wasn't there. Later on I realized it was the illness. No you didn't trigger me. I don't find my experiences traumatic. Have a good day as well."

But because my parents is really restrict my game access, my pressure becomes more. When I feel happy, I just do my activity normally. When I don't feel happy, I feel just like I'm a garbage. Can someone help me? Please let me know."

175974308,"Hey there, I've always been a big-time social anxiety sufferer. The worst part is that no one knows because I come off as congenial and upbeat but most of the time, I'm quite terrified of social situations. Often times, I have that anticipatory anxiety over a future event. Anyways, the pandemic over the last year has made me feel even more frightened of meeting and speaking with people. But I know, once we all reemerge, it's going to be a lot of social situations. That said, I'm looking for any suggestions on books on social anxiety, specifically. I'm also open to other media like podcasts. I'm hoping to find some techniques that will help me live a happier, healthier, less fearful life.

175974319,"If I didn't take it this morning, I'd still be in bed. Without, I just stay in bed for months.. No one believes me though. It's really helpful. I use it as a tool to stay awake and focus - That's it. My focus is so bad without it. I can't even play guitar. I took it and decided to play guitar instead of when it wore off (I couldn't play because I was so out of it) and played it for an hour. It also helps with dissociation - Because when I'm not focused, I can get panic attacks. A doctor told me that he prescribed Vyvanse to someone that was having panic attacks due to lack of focus and it worked - It stopped his panic attacks. But honestly I'm tired of explaining it to everyone because they don't understand. It will be taken away again. I got taken off of it like 10 times by different doctors until they realized that they've made a mistake - Then they put me back on it again. It's really exhausting and makes me scared. I don't react to stimulants the same way as other people - Other people can go w
ithout it and just can't focus. The thing with me is that I also have severe hypersomnia and have had that since I was a teenager. I hate talking about it but I have to because no one gets it. I stopped abusing it 2-3 years ago because it's immature to abuse a medication that is used to try and help me. In fact I'm not abusing any of my meds anymore or taking hard drugs. I'm doing well. But my meds will be changed again.. It's only a matter of time."

Basically, I want to switch pdocs again and just have the pdoc prescribe the same stuff as what I want. I want our goals to be aligned, basically. I feel like that is not all that much to ask.

175974360,"Hi everyone. I was not sure where to post this, basically I am having a hard time dealing with family issues. In particular an on going situation with my oldest sister and Mom which I have posted about in the past in various forums. To make it as short as possible, my mother has felt obligated to help my oldest sister care for her children and herself, this is because my mother feels guilt over never having left our very abusive father, and therefore blames herself for any problems me, my two sisters and my brother have. My oldest sister has taken complete advantage of that, and has manipulated my mother to move into my her apartment with her two children, and help. What went from just ""helping my sister"" get over a ""hump"" due to her husband up and abandoning her and her two children, quickly became my Mother raising my sister's two children for the better part of 14 years. What started out as depression for my sister, became ""chronic"" back pain, and finally a diagnosis of stiff person's synd
rome. My other sister and I felt that my sister was taking HUGHE advantage of our Mother. Whatever happy life my Mother could have had after my Dad passed away, was sucked out of her by my sister. For years my other sister and I would tell my mother that our sister was perfectly capable of caring for herself and two kids. My mother was convinced, through mostly the moaning and groaning daily from my sister, that my sister's days were numbered, and my sister had mere years to live. My mother would not listen to a word we said and kept on caring for her and her two kids, even through Breast Cancer, which my sister kept secret from all of us. My mother didn't want us to know either. We found out through my brother (who is homeless) but had a conversation with my Mother one day when he stopped by to visit. My sister didn't allow my brother to stay with her as she felt she didn't trust him. Basically he told her she needs to take better care of her kids. She smoked like a chimney in the small apartment they lived 
in and drank like a fish. She got money from the state, and her money and my mother's social security paid the rent and needs, except my sister used the money to buy her kids expensive games and phones as well as herself. They owed at least 4 months back rent and eventually got kicked out. My Mother was left to deal with the court hearings to try and keep the apartment while battling breast cancer and even put off her surgery while my sister laid in bed claiming to be in too much pain to do anything. Both my other sister and I called her out on it and basically told her she is killing our Mother, along with calling child protective services on her for neglect. Ever since that day, my sister had full control over my mother, and would not allow my mother to call us or receive calls from us. She kept in her hands the only cell phone that worked, and screened any calls. Almost a year later, because neither I or my sister have heard from our Mother, and we were concerned on how her health was, I contacted my niece 
through an App, for her to tell me what I already knew, that her mother would not allow Grandmom to contact us because she was mad at us. Until 3 months ago, I received a text from My sister that my Mother was diagnosed with dementia. She basically wanted to start a clean slate, and have us all be in our Mother's life. assistance from the state as well as my mother's social security check all pay the rent in a 3 bedroom home they now live in which is 3 1/2 hours away from me two states over. My sister does not work, and is suddenly able to walk around, and acre for my mother so she says. have been to their house. It appeared as if my sister did 360. Doing the shopping, taking care of my mother's drs appointments, and caring from my Mom. She still has pain, but told me it is not as bad as the drs originally thought. MY mother was pretty much bed ridden when I went to see her for the first time. My sister decided to take advantage of a rehab center that would be paid for by medicade, to help get my mother off h
er feet, and healthy, because at this point she would not eat, or get out of bed, and was having fainting spells. After two weeks in the facility, my mother was a world of difference. She was clean, her hair was washed, she gained weight and she had color back in her face. She hated the place, but I felt she was well taken care of. I almost dreaded the day she left that place, because I felt that my sister could not have done that much of a 360. I went shopping for her and bought all of these healthy foods, only to go back and visit two weeks later to see she had not made my mother any of it. As a matter of fact I have been observing when I visit and realized, her two girls pretty much cook for themselves. They are 13 and 14 yrs old. The sink is piled with dishes each time I come over, to the point where I do them each time I visit, and they always seem to be out off food. I know it has to be difficult for my sister. She has to call a cab to shop, and she still has some back issues, but is completely mobile. 
I have bought my Mother clothes, food and necessities. I live 3 1/2 hours away so I try to helo out whenever I can. I am in my own bad situation. I live currently with my ex boyfriend and our daughter in a house we have lived in as a couple for over 10 years. I found over a year ago he cheated, which was just the last straw with him. He has been emotionally abusive and controlling for the 17 years we have been together which is why I decided to not ever marry him. Now I have to move out of his house and get an apartment, which has been taking some time. I have a lot of credit card debt that needs to get paid off before I can get an apartment. He controlled me financially as well, and I was able to put myself through school to get a full time job in accounting. Now I just need to pay off my debt and get an apartment. I bring this all up, as i wish I could care for my mother. Even if I had a place, I would not be home to care for her. She needs someone to cook for her and f=give her her medicaine, and basicaly 
watch her as her dementia seems to be the middle stages. At the same time I am concerned for the actual care she is getting from my sister. I went to visit last weekend, and she had tow bags of donuts on my mother's bed which was her breakfast. I also saw an empty box of donuts on my mother's bedroom floor. THe oatmeal i bought over 3 weeks ago was still in the cabnet un opened, as wkll as the cans of tuna, and pasta. SHe is clearly not making sure my mother has proper nutrional meals. I made my Mother a healty lunch while i was there. I always do. But i know when I leave , they come few and far between. My mother has a nurse come every week to give my Mom a check up whcih I feel better about , but I am just worried for her. I asked her if she wanted to live with me, and she said she would love to, but not right now. She still feels she needs to stay wth my sister. I would feel terrible guilt taking her out of a home with my sister and my neices especially since she has been living with them for 14 years. I d
o not even have the means to care for My mom although I woudl if I had the money to afford a live in nurse, but I can not even afford my own apartment right now. I can not ask my ex if my Mom could move in his house that I am living in now. THat would not be fair for him or my MOotherf, plus I would never get away from hm and on with my life if that happened. I feel at the point that if I speak u to my sister about y concerns, she will get deeply offended and not allow me to talk to orr see my mother. I did express my concerns about a copule of things while i visited over the weekend, and already its been 4 days and she still has not returned my call I even texted her to ask how my mother is, and no response. I feel if I say ANYTHING she does not want to hear, this is the result. I am so very sorry for such a long post. I have been holding it all in for a while, and it just came pouring out once i stared typing. I am dealing with my own health issues, so this does not help. I know it can not be easy caretakin
g for your parent with dementia, so I know she is stressed, however I feel my mother took care of my sister and her kids for 14 years unnecesserily, it is her turn to step up and care for my Mother. She does snot even take good care of herself or her kids, so that is what nauseates me. Thanks for reading Post Edited (FearBug) : 7/22/2019 5:50:54 PM (GMT-6)"

I don’t know the proper way to put this so I guess I’m just going to lay it all out at once. I’m currently a Senior in Highschool a week away from graduating amidst a global pandemic... and that’s probably the least of my problems. I don’t have the healthiest relationship with my parents. I used to have friends... but they have pretty much all left me or I’ve left them. I am in a relationship surprisingly... but I’m approximately 90% sure it’s a toxic relationship but I guess it’s rather hard for me to know for sure because that’s all I’ve ever really known: my parents are in a relationship only held together by what their religion tells them about how wrong divorce is. Yeah that’s another thing: I’m an atheist in a household of very... very religious people who don’t exactly see eye to eye with certain aspect
s of my life (like my sexuality to just scratch the surface of the iceberg). I suppose I should probably stop complaining about my life now, all things considered, there’s people out there who have it far worse than me. Basically what I’m trying to say is that I don’t know what to do at this point. My parents have taken me to therapists when my... situation... has gotten extreme, and I’ve been to two others on my own volition. One of the reasons why I’m here is that we live in such a small town, everyone knows everyone and I had an incident where I was... in trouble... for sharing information with a “trusted” therapist who was apparently friends with my parents. I’ve had pre-existing trust issues before this, but that event certainly didn’t help anything, and I may also have a mental health condition that I’ve never really spoken to anyone about other than my current partner (the potentially toxic one) and I really only have WebMD to go off of, but there’s so much fake news out there abo
ut people having it or not having it, I never considered bringing it before one of my therapists. I’m going to stop rambling now... I don’t even know if anyone is going to see this... but please... if anyone can shed light on my situation(s) I would be extremely thankful. I really don’t know what else to do..."

I visualize my mantra, I see it spelled out in my mind. I breathe in and see one syllable and breathe out and see the next. My mantra is ooom-_NAME_-eee-yom. You can use it if you would like. It is a meaningless word to me. Some say they should be six syllables but mine is only four. I hope that this helps. Hugs, _NAME_... This is something I haven't tried.

I also have used the 4-7-8 breathing technique: breathe in through nose 4 seconds, hold breath or 7 seconds, breathe out for 8 seconds. Listening to meditative music to relax before sleep is helpful . ( _NAME
_ Music for the Soul CD is perfect for this). Does anyone else have favorite meditative practices?"

175974377,"What makes you assume men do NOT act in this way. Some do, some don’t. You cannot generalise And What makes you assume women are stupid enough to NOT see when men act this way? Why do you view women as objects to be ###$ , rather than individuals equally capable of manipulating men if they choose, or not ? Many of your generalisations underestimate other people in general. Perhaps you need to wonder if your perceptions of others are accurate. And why do you want so much to be like others when you have such disdain for them? Again, assumptions about how other people think. Are you assuming others feel a sense of responsibility when you do not. Have you considered they may not? Hard to know if this is a true statement or one that feeds a certain image of how you think you are. Glad to know something makes you happy. Or does it? What things do you get from it ? Pleasure or a further sense of alienation from the ‘normal people’ you desire to understand so much. It can be liberating to accept one 
is different, rather than trying to fit in. One can celebrate this difference and cultivate a sense of liking who they are regardless of others and society's sense of how we should be. ‘Recovered’ cannot apply in my opinion, especially as I think there is NO SUCH THING as normal, but acceptance is a start, a good start and brings its own form of joy. Most of our problems stem from hating who we are. I personally do not respect or like society’s idea of ‘normal’ people enough to aspire to be like them. I thought I envied those who can Love and be intimate with others but upon deeper probing I see their lives can be just as ###$ up as mine. Perhaps a small start for you is to realise NO ONE is happy. NO ONE is normal. _PERSON_ is my philosopher and guru. Again and again his famous quote ''All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players' ' .. comes to mind. whether you find a spiritual, philosophical or scientific path to help you reconcile with life, ‘good acting skills’ always co
me in useful. If you have that, as you have indicated, then count it a plus. The fact you self-reflect and question life is a good thing in my opinion. Even if it means you cannot be 'the average _NAME_'."

What got me out of that was, strangely, antidepressants being prescribed for me instead of only antipsychotics.

The fact that you’re saying this today, that you’re able to ref

Well I did but I ignored them.. I went into addictions to cope. I would eat candy, coca cola or buy food when I wasn't hungry so I could stand and not have to talk to people or make friends because it looked like I was doing something.

I can't seem to drink beers when reading but I noticed that weed gummies make reading more interesting but it's a hit and miss with the 5mg cuz it mostly doesn't get me high and 10mg would be way too much and give me paranoia and anxiety. Right now I'm going to watch _NAME_ and Dr. _NAME_ talk and this time I'm gonna write things down in my notes. Then I'll probably read tomorrow just to chill out. I might go to the library and find some other books too. I kind of don't feel like reading one book at a time unless it really really draws me in.

175974404,"Brainsurgerysfun, hi. Thanks for your answer. Yes, this thing has a name and scientists say it is connected to being or feeling dizzy when standing somewhere high or thinking of a high place which creates some weird reaction in the brain which it registers as “this is not safe, step away from the edge” but misinterprets it somehow and you think you want to jump. It is a brain reaction and I read that people have it a lot, also when there is a train passing. People get so distressed they have to turn their back not to look at the train and the platform. It’s kind of like OCD but this one is more weird I guess. You can read more about this on the net as there are a lot of articles about it. This one is the first I found: https://www.headspace.com/blog/2017/04/09/high-places-phenomenon/ . Don’t feel alone in this. I guess anxiety makes it worse. And in my case I was very anxious. Still am, and I think meds might alleviate this. Also this might fall under the term “harm ocd” but I’m not c
ertain as I’m not a doctor so don’t understand that well. But these are some good leads I think. Write to me if you feel overwhelmed."

175974411,"_NAME_ and theHTreurns Thanks for your time in responding. First in response to _NAME_ posted "" People with a borderline personality disorder also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships."" I have read much on the subject and this does in an indeed too a great degree describe what occurs and then of course over a period of time with enough reassurances she does back around and is the most affectionate -- and by this I mean just a joy to be around too-- however this always seem to be transitory and can last for months until-- something triggers. She self medicates a lot (alcohol) and she does slip into and out of depression. This took me a while to recognize. Of course, she seeks out her longtime girlfriend who then fuels the fire, having no idea what is occur

I know it takes a professional to fully diagnose this but what I have to accept is if she is not ""full-blown"" or as I understand it ""classic"" BPD (there is no evidence of physical self-abuse or suicidal behavior as a rule. She did once put a gun to her head in one of the deep depression moments. The real truth for me is simply, despite my feeling for her with the current anger-fueled ""I want a divorce"" the best step is to say, ok, go for it. Perhaps that will give you happiness.

175974412,"I enjoyed reading this dream. Rome is your psyche. All the citizens(sub-personalities like instincts, desires, bodily functions) turned against the emperor (You). You realized that you have no power and the power resides out of your conscious reach. The real power is in your subconscious. ""You"" exist by eating your own sh*t. The ego is a feed back loop that exists on it's own delusions. If anything this dream somehow remaining in your memory then coming to fruition by posting on a forum for some rando to interpret back to you is interesting.

175974423,No I haven’t been evaluated for ADHD. That would likely be the culprit though. I’ve had these terrible problems with impulsivity and inability to make decisions. My pdoc always thought it was psychosis related. I personally don’t think it is related to psychosis because I haven’t had any other symptoms of psychosis.
175974424,The first time I went to an ER and that was a waste of time. Then I signed myself into a psychatric center where they can keep you as inpatient. After talking to them for quite awhile I was released and wasn't inpatient. They showed me ways on how to cope with things when I'm stressed. They never did say anything about the voices. Then I just had a Psychaitrist say if it's sleep related then it's usually not related to any psychotic disorder.

174367528,"I feel similar while majoring in human services and psychology in college. Especially in the abnormal psych classes I've been in with the professors talking all about people with schizophrenia and bipolar symptoms, medications, etc and then other students commenting on people they've seen or worked with and some of them being shocked by some of the symptoms and stuff. It's strange. I know there's people who have experienced anxiety and stuff in those classes and can relate to that but then the psychotic type stuff most don't understand personally or haven't had that experience and only know of the schizophrenic people they've seen in movies or walking down the streets yelling and whatnot, and it's weird hearing about all that stuff knowing I have the disorder I do and what I've experienced"

The purpose of my post was to show how hard it can be to overcome addiction...I realize that some of 
you won't get that. But that's okay...I thank those of you who are listening. Peace."
175974487,Who is it???
175974488,I had an awful first appt. I was recommended by my obgyn to a nonprofit to do the confirmation of pregnancy and they initially brought me to a back room and talked to talk to me about Jesus for 30 min and then I did the test. It was really really weird and I’m Christian sooooooo. But their test came back negative??? So I went and bought my own test today and it shows a line and another faint line. So I think I’m still pregnant. We will see in a few days. How weird today has been already.

Anyway, how is everyone else doing today?"
175974507,"I would have done the same as you. Your mother reminds me very much of mine. Is your mother ever rational , or does she always expect you to behave according to her unrealistic fantasy script? It sounds like you realize you exist, despite the fact that your mother doesn't treat you as a thinking individual with rights. Having your own thoughts puts you way ahead of the game. It took me decades to recognize that I had rights, and to value my own thoughts. Q: What joy could there be in giving your child stuff they didn't ask for? Who benefits? A: The parent's self-image benefits. In 5th grade, my class made book covers to give as Mother's Day presents. My mother started screaming at me in no uncertain terms because I had made her a gift instead of buying her something. She didn't even look at the book cover I made her. _NAME_'s Day, Mother's Day, etc., stimulate the economy via blackmail. You are FAR more self-aware than your mother in many, many ways, especially regarding society's debt-incurring 'r
equirements'. Sounds like you can't win. I'd be tired of it too. The late teens through the late twenties are a terrible time in people's lives--often the worst part of life. If you tough it out, things often get better. Can you get a job and move out soon? * * * Regarding posting / talking about things, you might be interested in taking a look at the etymology of paregoric (tincture of opium, an antidiarrheal and pain reliever ): Talking publicly about our problems soothes us all in some way. It's not just baby sea turtles who have a lot of shlt to deal with in order to survive. Life is a polishing drum--a polisher of the soul."
175974508,i agree there is a lot of distraction involved with sz. i posted on another thread and was aptly advised by _NAME_ to stick to the topic of the thread. this thread is specifically about manipulation which is the gist of what i have been trying to post about on this forum. i subscribe to the collective cloud as a mainstream label for an omnibrain of existence. i think the gap between cloud and channel is constantly trying to defend itself with distraction. it could be like access points are effectively being framed to entrap channels into biting on fishing edits of manipulation. i see it as apt for the collective cloud to do this to establish and maintain it's authority and to help channels to do less second guessing.

175974513,"_AT_MENTION_: yeah it makes sense, thank you very much for your answer. If I ask a question, it means that I want to know the truth about it, then I am ready for an unpleasant answer, but I could need sometime to elaborate it, it could be not immediate. _AT_MENTION_: it's a subconscious mechanism; it occurs with my closest, or those I feel emotionally very involved with. My words, and sometimes my beliefs and acts, aren't “pure”. I regulate them to get the wanted reaction. People like it, as long as they get what they want. On the opposite, they sometimes move away if you stop and follow your inner direction. Even more because my manipulation is “pro-social”, they aren't damaged; the exchange isn't ""pure"", but mostly they don't realize it. They should realize that they, too, haven't a pure motivation: if they wouldn't wish something, manipulation wouldn't work or I wouldn't “need” it to get what I want. However, in the past, I met someone who perceived and disliked it, I liked him a l
ot and since that moment I am working on it. I could say it's in his “memory”."

175974520,"I've thought about this a lot last year, as I had watched the remaining seasons of The Walking Dead I hadn't watched, so I saw 3 seasons day after day, and watched the entire ""Negan/Saviours"" arc, I saw myself as most likely in real life being on _PERSON_ side...I'd rather be part of the elite ruling class who is willing to kill brutality than the one picking cotton in fear for life. So my plan would be to join a group, but I wouldn't necessarily stay with that group, if another one came along that was more fitting to me and my overall objective, I'd go there and take whatever supplies from previous group I can...if in one group I figured an extrovert would work well as leader and would be willing to do anything to stay alive, I'd try to convince him to take charge and all that...ideally though I join a group with an already strong leader. So with a leader in place, with me siding up to them (I have no strong desire to lead directly myself, its too much to deal with, and I'd rather have power, in
fluence, privileges without full focus on me), I would arrange for our group to come into direct threat from other group of humans, and of course who saves our group? Me and the leader. Now that our group is completely aware of threat from other people, what it takes to stay alive, and who saved them, they will be more willing to follow orders in general, including tough ones. So from there we go to other groups, ask if they wanna join, if they refuse, kill their leader, and take their supplies. I could go on, but end goal would be to clear out areas of zombies, set up blocks, and have a base where most people live, which ultimately will keep expanding, the more zombies cleared out of areas and new blocks put up, etc. That or I'll just go it alone."

175974522,"Hi AK, I have been needing more medication for anxiety and depression. I feel I need it at this time and it is there. If I get dependent on it, I will deal with that when the time comes. I can't live in fear and anxiety. And the medications help me cope. So try not to beat yourself up for taking it when you need it. But maybe try some breathing exercises in the mean time. FP, I am glad you have a new found hobby to keep your mind and hands busy. I like to crochet. I use to make scarves but after awhile everybody had one because I was giving them away and there really wasn't any need to make more. I like the infinity scarves. Trina (the other depression mod) makes lap blankets for people in nursing homes. I might start just to have a cause to make me feel good.

You have had, all in a few weeks, loss of efficacy/discontinuation, a start up with an entirely new med, and finally an increase. That is a lot for your system to go through! Are you able to use all available tools that you possibly can right now? Do you have a rescue Rx? Either a benzo or a benzo alternative such as Vistaril? (prescript ion antihistamine) How about self help coping skills? Meditation and Therapy Worksheets can be absolutely crucial during rough spots in our management.

Felt like I was crazy. But it stabilized! I am back on my Zoloft, just a bit of a higher dose than before. Sometimes it takes a few weeks for something to stabilize. And if you are switching over from a different medication, it can be a bit of a shock to your body to have the sudden switch -- remember that it's actual brain chemicals getting messed with!

175974572,"Reality is indeed weird. Feelings are weird too. They’re fluctuating. What we feel so important now, like material things, anger, happiness, sadness, etc, they don’t last. During the Ancient Rome era purple color was for the royalty only, they thought it was so precious that the commoners shouldn’t wear it. Today purple is just purple, even beggars can wear it. Or like feelings, when I had my first crush in the middle school I thought that guy was perfect. Looking back now I cringe, dude couldn’t even do a simple math. So was anger I used to feel towards my abusers, it has disappeared now. I see both reality and feelings as tools to my goal. I just have two goals for now, making money to take care of my family and people around me, and making a progression in my spiritual journey because I believe in the after life. I want to be a good person. I refuse to believe that we just disappear after we die because that would mean that my struggles and efforts would go in vain. There must be an ulti
mate justice after I die. But that’s my perspective, others might have different views and it’s fine. So yeah, I’ve been trying not to glorify reality or my feelings. Doesn’t mean I run away to imagination’s never land or denying/put aside my feelings, but to see them as tools. Using the imagination and make plans for it to become reality to change the reality I am in now that isn’t comfortable. Processing my feelings to have a self awareness and change them into more proper feelings to have based on the situation I’m in. Idk if all of these make sense ?"
175974573,o.k _PERSON_...so sorry to have misunderstood you. I will gladly remove it. Have a good day.
175974574,"You use some interesting language in your post. “Is allowed”. People make choices. You can’t ethically prevent people from their own agency, and people are imperfect. I’ve lied. I didn’t want to. I don’t like lying. I try not to lie. But I’ve lied. I think that most people have lied at one point or another. Now, you can decide if that prevents you from being able to engage in relationships entirely, and it looks like maybe you have, but any relationships you will ever have will be with imperfect people, although some are more honest and ethical than others. And then, you use the phrase “there is nothing binding me to be nice” and that’s really interesting for me, because there never really is anything binding anyone to niceness except personal ethics. Niceness isn’t a due for moral perfection, because if it were, there would be no niceness. It seems as though this post seeks justification for malice, and if you hold people to the standard of perfection then you will always fin
d reasons to be malicious, but then you fail your own moral test in the same way others do, and then no one has reason to be nice to you either. It is possible that people are lying to you in a non malicious way. They may be thinking that by lying to you they are sparing your feelings. Perhaps they don’t know the way you feel about it. Perhaps you haven’t communicated this to them. I get it — the struggle. Really, I do. A lot of people on this forum have suffered abusive, or unhealthy relationships and it makes many of us hyper vigilant for signs that people will hurt us, so the struggle will always be whether it’s worth the risk of trying for any relationship, the best of which will be an imperfect but beneficial one, and the worst of which will be another unhealthy one. I can’t say that I often take the risk either, but my personal ethics will always influence me to treat others as well as I can."

175974610,"Personality disorders are not that precisely defined. Different schools in psychology have different terminology, so what is called ""schizoid"" for one school may be called ""avoidant"" for another. The descriptions in the DSM are based on symptoms and behavior and are more about how these conditions present themselves to others rather than how they are experienced by the people afflicted. In some schools of modern psychoanalysis, such as objects relations theory, schizoid personality disorder would include avoidant personality disorder. The difference between the classical schizoids and the avoidants is that avoidants are more aware of their longing for connectedness. But ""pure"" schizoids are also difficult to study because they would never voluntarily seek the help of a counselor."

175974612,"Hi all. Ugh, I’ve been struggling. I feel like I’ve had a cold or allergies for a week or so now. Runny nose some, sneezing, and coughing. Of course the coughing is what I’m worried about ????? It sounds kind of raspy and I’m just worried it’s something worse. Since I recovered from phnemonia in December I’m paranoid anytime I get sick it’s going to be really bad. I had a pulmonary function test 3 weeks ago and it was totally normal. I’m scheduled for a methocoline challenge to test for asthma but it was cancelled due to the corona virus. I’m just worrying myself crazy thinking the cough is more than just a cold or allergies it’s phnemonia again or this new virus even though I have no fever or other signs of this virus! I’m 32 and otherwise healthy ?????When I had phnemonia they did multiple xrays of my lungs and looked fine the only reason I was diagnosed was they noticed a small area in my left lung so now anytime I’ve been coughing I notice my left lung feels sore then it 
goes away when I don’t think about it. I’m trying to tell myself it’s okay and just a regular virus or cold but I’m driving myself crazy here. ?"

174367687,"Or they have a different imprint, no different than living as an alien in another culture. Both can be true as well. Just imagine someone living in a world that changes all the time, a chaotic world. Then there is nothing to imprint, things are just too random, so the person becomes random personified. If there were no constants in the Universe, there would be no science. Believing you know something would be delusional and hurtful. Its useful in chaotic environments, or when things change, it allows to find solutions that have never been tried. If you have a filter, then you will loose that ability and you won't even know it and never will. It takes a lot to overcome conditioning, usually a lot of violence. On the other hand, when things are ordered, it becomes a flaw, because you go slower, and if there is competition, it is a weakness. If there is a nail to be attacked, someone that has a filter that says only a hammer can do it, will find the hammer faster than the one that looks at all the too
ls and try to guess the one that might be acceptable for the task. Its also more likely to work. Yes, but that is something else, because it is not unconscious. Norms that are ordered and revealed to people, they don't go through the filter. This is moral proper, not pre-moral. The thing is that morality is simply habits, they can come from different sources, one is authority, the other customs, the other personal experience. You are talking about authority, I am more talking about customs. What is right is usually in the personal realm, because it is contingent on reality. I will take the analogy of food again. Frozen food is the one from authority, the personal is fresh food. And there is a middle one, which is the filter and customs. That would be cured meat and the like, canned food. Polar bears use fat instead. I don't see dopamine being involved. It sounds more like neuron clusters. That is how people learn in general. If there is point a, b and c that follow a logical path, the filter will create new n
eurons that go directly from point a to c, dismissing b. So it is good if you never need b, it is faster, but in the odd case b might be relevant, then you are screwed because you've just made b invisible and inexistent. The only way to get it back is to destroy those neurons, and the most you used them, the harder it will be. So in essence, b is a hole, it does not exist anymore. And they should, only grooming can fix this and there is no magic pill. Either that or get rid of the stress, which means isolation. Its not rocket science. If a child is scared of monsters in the dark, a normal parent would groom, and it fixes the problem biologically. If you give a sleeping pill instead, it is expedient, but does not solve the monster problem, they will still use scare tactics against the child, and if anything you just took out the ability to defend and deal with the monsters appropriately. So the pill will simply postpone and make things worst in the long run. If they be a personality trait, yes. Its a different 
issue than dealing with stress. But if someone is in a stressful environment, especially an early one, and grooming fails or does not exist, it will create odd beliefs, because normal solutions don't work. So authority and customs fail, which means there is a need for independent thinking to solve monsters, and once it is solved, there is no reason to go back, but since the solutions is different than the one of the others in the environment, it will cause clashes in place you would not necessarily expect, like a butterfly effect. That is what I believe. Not only that, but trust can disappear, so if trust is not there, there will be a mistrust of any filter in general, since they will be hurtful and not appropriate ever, because situations are different. And that lack of trust will cause issues by not adopting solutions that could work, or just finding one that works personally, but not socially. Its the whole point of authority and customs, to have something that works decent for most, but if someone falls i
n-between the net, the whole thing fails for that person. It comes from pretty much everybody together. You are thinking too grand scale, I am thinking small. Its usually little things, like having the correctly groomed fur, or how to dispose of dead animals and what is the proper time to hibernate or mate. Its just that in order to understand ""rights"", you have to be politically emancipated, and be under a state that is emancipated from custom/religion/ideologies. That is how the liberal scheme came to be. But it so happens the liberals only emancipated themselves, so now you have a bunch of feudal people that are jealous because constipated. Since they don't understand rights, they ask for privilege, because a feudal state can only give privilege, not rights, since the state is itself constipated. And constipation creates a lot of you know what in the wrong place. Bad diet. Since they have bad diet, they try to ban good diet. Make others as miserable as they are. With good reason. As opposed to the sovere
ignty of God. But understood as it should, so the sovereignty of reality, especially social reality. In a feudal state, the reality is authority and customs, which are more important than even the king. It does not mean the king does not have some leadership, but it is not a totally emancipated one. He is even less free than his subjects, with all the courtiers and priests around, without counting the people who want his head. What he can do though, is give privilege to some classes of people, give them a political existence separate from others, through which they can talk to him. Today it is called identity politics. The only problem is that in a democracy where there is no king, the state is supposed to treat people equally, since it is owned by the people as a whole. Its the concepts of equality and liberty, and rights. So people have individual rights, not class privileges. They are men, not roles. Man is the ideal, the political man, that has no identity, but is a citizen. The real man is free to have w
hatever identity he wishes, but it is one that has no political power. Its the secular humanist scheme, or liberal scheme. Feudal people in such a scheme are regressive and asking for the impossible. The best they can get is a dictatorship, and that is the end of rights and privileges. China for example, is such a scheme. Their population is feudal and not emancipated, and never was, so they can only have something that looks like democracy from their point of view, which is simply totalitarian, but with people equal in misery and a meritocratic way for the peasant to become king. Although they have started to give privileges in the free market zones. Same thing as above. They are old neurons that have been relatively disconnected, so getting back to them take some efforts to get the right data rate. Its like having an old route. with a bridge. The bridge is still there, but the path to it might have potholes, so it is harder to get to, or it is covered in grass, although it still exists, just not working for 
carts. Yes, it looks like it. No, I speak with all the animals of the forest. Its just that there are primates everywhere, they breed like crazy. They self-identify with ""men"", I know who they really are. Its the other way around. Primates and lots of animals can't eat fresh, so you have to either cure it or freeze it for conservation. Primates are like squirrels, they hoard things that they cannot eat right away, instead of doing it right and fatting. I don't eat them, but I read in their entrails. That's what dead things are good for. They can tell you the future. They can also attract animals that can be eaten, although they rarely are of much nutritional value. Yeah, you don't understand what I mean by idealize. Its about freezing it and putting it in cans. In order to devalue something, it needs to be idealized first. Whether you keep it or not is a second step. I just learned that having the right attitude is the most important thing. There is no point in living if you are miserable. See, it relates t
o the above in politics. Man was idealized, although not everybody understood what Man meant. So some accepted it and understood it and thrived. Others rejected it and got miserable. But that is what is there to eat, it is the reality, so its up to people to either accept it or keep hoping for dead things and be reactionaries. Or carrion crawlers as it were. You can feel things without sharing said feeling and idealizing it. That is fresh diet. Frozen and cured foods are dead meat, although better than rotten. Water is emotion, and the unconscious, a good place for ursus maritimus. The land is where other animals are, the social idealized sphere. That is where farmers live, which have not much to give to ursus maritimus, aside from some fresh vegetables, but it lacks fat, so cannot be conserved in the right way. But it can do in a pinch. Ice is the personality. In order for ursus maritimus to go on land, he has to get through the ice, sometimes walk on it and reach the wastelands where primates roam and fight 
for their piece of farm. Primates create global warming that melts the ice. But the real thing about ice, is that you can swim under, break through it and take seals by surprise, or simply wait besides a whole that a seal use it for breathing. Its part and parcel of the traditional hunting techniques. Primates on land have values, which are idealized morality, dead things again. Ursus maritimus is one with his environment in reality, and is properly moral, since natural. One with the sea. Yes -- Wed Jan 22, 2020 8:56 am -- Its one way to see it. Its just that in a case like psychosis, reality and dream become one, so impossible to distinguish except here and there and with efforts. So it gets out of control internally and externally as well. But overall it is the same thing in my opinion, even if the cause might be different."
175974623,"Most mental illness is of the chronic variety which means we must learn to cope rather try to overcome. That does not mean you have to suffer all the time, though. A wide array of treatments are now available that can be tailored to fit your specific needs. Learning the right combo of meds, talk therapies, and physical health management takes time, but is well worth the effort. Always keep in mind that this is an ongoing journey and not a goal to be conquered. Persistence is the key. Keep going not matter what. And keep reaching out."

But since hospitalization has been brought up lately, I didn't want my employer totally blindsided if I do end up hospitalized or something. Anyway, she was super supportive! She said she suffered from depression for 14 years before finally getting the right depression medication and then it just clicked for her! She told me I am not alone. And that my health is more important than work. If I do have to be hospitalized that she will come out from NY to CA if need be to fill in while I am gone. It's like a weight is lifted off of me.

175974650,"*This week has been a marathon of activity in which I have accomplished much but produced little in terms of writing. Continuing _NAME_., a precarious work schedule, and Spring Break for two of my kids have made the challenges of deadlines even more difficult to meet. My intention was to post a piece regarding Borderline Personality Disorder by week’s end. Unfortunately, that post must wait until Monday for completion. (Don’t ask… it’s complicated.) However, as a precursor to my up-coming post on BDP, I have decided to re-post a short and to-the-point piece that I wrote over a year ago regarding a manipulative tactic used by emotional abusers referred to as “The Gaslight Effect.” My hope is that the reader will gain not only knowledge of this diabolical technique but also gain effective tools of response to combat pervasive psychological warfare perpetrated by those who wish to control them and do them significant harm. “Gaslighting” is clinically defined as “intimidation or psych
ological abuse in which false information is deliberately presented to the victim, making them doubt their own memory and/or perception of an event or events.” The most diabolical and deceitful personalities use this tactic in their daily lives to get their way and avoid responsibility at the expense and to the detriment of their victims. Power relationships are hot-beds, if you will, for this out-right evil tool of hidden manipulation which thrives on the aggressor dominating and asserting power, coupled with the victim acquiescing to their demands and giving them power. Although, traditionally seen in male/female romantic relationships, Gaslighting can, and often does occur in parent-to-child relationships with mothers the common perpetrators. Additionally, this dynamic can be found in female-to-female relationships often described as “frenemy” (of frienemy, if you prefer) relationships in which the self-professed Alpha female dominates all others for personal gain. Something akin to the movie Mean Gi
rls likely just sprung to mind which is a somewhat accurate example of the dynamic that exists in such power relationships. Where did we acquire the term Gaslighting Effect? From the 1944 movie, Gaslight, starring _NAME_ and _NAME_ in which _PERSON_’s character tries to drive “insane” his wife played by _PERSON_. Relative to nothing, it should be noted that this version of the film was a remake of the 1940 film of the same name starring _NAME_ and _NAME_. The original film was an adaptation of the play “Gas Light” written in 1938 by _NAME_. Personally, I believe the later version of the film with _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ tells a better story and better defines the hidden manipulative behavior in question than the original film. I strongly recommend to the reader that if you have not seen the film, then go now – after you finish reading this, of course – and rent it from Netflix for a better understanding of the behavior in action. “Enough background!” you say? “What exactly is Gaslighting? Wh
at does the tactic entail?” My hope for the reader in this next section is that it elicits at least one, if not many, “Eureka!” moments as perhaps each of you recognize that you are in one or more of these power relationships and that, no, you aren’t crazy! The gaslighter’s over all goal is to modify evidence then falsify information for the purpose of making their intended target(s) question their own recollection, memory, analysis, and perception of events and/or behaviors. In other words, they reject reality and substitute it with their own for personal gain and entertainment. In short, they enjoy inflicting psychological pain onto others and will stop at nothing to psychologically abuse their targets in order to get their own way. So what is it that they do? The primary behaviors are listed as follows: Deny existence of an event even when presented with evidence (Denial); Deliberately block their victims from source data (Compartmentalizing); Deny behaviors by immediately putting their targets o
n the defensive (Deflection); Insist that their targets are imagining things (Chronic Invalidation); Shame their targets for expressing very real hurts (Minimization); Insist that others are the source of their poor choices (Blaming); Mentally abuse their targets with criticism veiled as “advice” (Depreciation); (Usually) must have the last word (again, Chronic Invalidation); Force agreement by their targets to accept their false reality (Domination); Engage in gossip in order to hurt and control their targets (Humiliation); Has the ability to “sell ice to an Eskimo” meaning that they are persistent and manipulative enough to convince someone to invest in something that they could receive for free (Insincerity). The above described behaviors are perpetrated in concert and incessantly by ambient abusers, always. At their very core, those who Gaslight others are accomplished con artists who know how to select, isolate, and then stealthily psychologically abuse their targets into submission for their own 
personal gain. Gaslighters are bullies who often hide behind a good-guy (or girl) persona and have no hesitation about portraying themselves as a “victim” to be pitied for the purpose of maintaining control over others. They are utterly anti-social as evidenced by their persistent choices in violating the rights of others. They are never to be trusted. Let me be perfectly clear before I go any further that within a parent-to-child gaslighting dynamic the child has little choice but to comply with their ambient abuser so the term “enabling” does not apply in that context. However, within peer-to-peer relationships, enabling drives the behavior forward and does nothing to stop the relentless abuse. Dr. _NAME_, author of the book The Gaslight Effect: How to Spot and Survive the Hidden Manipulation Others Use to Control Your Life describes the dynamic between the abuser and abused as “The Gaslight Tango” which I think is a brilliant description of how the manipulative tool works collectively with thos
e who enable them. She offers a fresh perspective on the enabling behavior of the gaslighting victim which shines a much brighter light on how abusers often get away with their diabolical behaviors. The abuser understands clearly that there is an energy cost associated with their targets disengaging from their abusiveness and they exploit that cost to their advantage whenever possible. Ambient abusers are classic nit-pickers who redirect attention away from their own abusive behavior by engaging in insidious forms of abuse that are not clearly recognizable by the general public as abusive behavior. For example, ambient abusers often publicly shame their targets for insignificant errors as a deflective tactic to keep others from looking at the abuser’s behavior. When questioned about their own behavior they use the following phrases to gain the silence and compliance from their targets: “I can’t talk you to you when you get like this…” (Makes their target sound unreasonable and puts the responsibilit
y entirely on the target.) “After everything that I’ve done for you…” (Routinely tries to buy the targets willingness to comply through gifts and favors only to turn around and, when convenient, demand “repayment.”) “How can you be so selfish…” (Usually said when they meet resistance at getting their own way.) “If you loved me you would [xyz]…” (Classic coercive tactic.) “Can’t you see how you’re hurting me…” (Which is usually said when confronted about their own abusive behavior.) Psychopathic personalities very often hide in plain sight and seek refuge behind those persons whom they know can be easily controlled. The psychological, emotional, and physical abuser knows how to exploit others for their own deceitful gain. These abusive persons – who very often are women – will “gaslight” their victims relentlessly and will also flat-out deny all abusive behaviors even in the face of physical evidence. All that is needed for the abuser to continue without consequence is 
the buy-in and silence of those who know the truth and yet say nothing. Plainly stated, family members, friends, pastors, counselors, teachers, and any other persons that know of and/or witness abuse then do nothing to stop it are complicit in its perpetration. Make no mistake in understanding that psychological aggression is, in fact, a form of violence which leaves no physical scars making ambient abuse both insidious and pervasive. I hope that the reader has found this information enlightening and helpful. I further hope that it challenges those who allow themselves to be dominated by emotional abusers to rethink their choices and then stop the cycle of abuse by disengaging from the madness. There is an energy cost associated with disengaging the ambient abuser; however, it is far less than the cost of allowing them to continue to perpetrate abuse.

I hope others here who hear voices will see your post and respond with their own experiences. Thanks as always for sharing. Sincerely yours, _PERSON_"
175974652,I've tried in the past but I feel guilty for throwing all my problems at them when they probably have loads of others to deal with including their own.
175974653,"I'm disappointed. My sister said the schedule was mixed up. My nephews game is a home game this week and it's on Saturday, not Friday. So I won't get to watch him play football after all. I'm sad."
175974654,"Have taken a bunch of walks today, trying to get my activity level up since it's kind of dropped with the med changes and them being very sedating"
175974655,I could be actually bipolar 1 or schizoaffective I have no idea anymore. I guess the label doesn’t really matter except to help medication. I feel a bit calmer now I took some meds.
175974656,Man. Finally got decent sleep last night. I can control anxiety in the day but not while I sleep. Still worried about my sister and what we’ll find out about her tumor.
175974657,"I think the amoxicillin is helping a bit. Maybe I do have strep. My left tonsil is still swollen but it’s not in much pain like it was yesterday. I ended up going to bed early, I was in so much pain."
175974658,So sorry you feel this way. Have you spoken to an adult or doctor about it
175974659,"Do you agree with the notion that you have to be ""normal?"""
175974660,Happy new year everyone!!!!!
175974661,"Yes, but didn't wash my hair, it gets frizzy if I wash it too often."

175974664,"That would be excellent in my opinion. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to vote on Tuesday."
175974665,Oh no! What's going on?
175974666,Really? I always imagined that you have long hair. It must be something you said one time.
175974667,"hugs, newtus."
175974668,Well now that's weird. I italicized and quoted the poetry but now it looks faded and blends in with the background... Hmm...
175974669,I am having a little clarity for the moment...was talking to my partner and it can be traced back to a month ago when the psychosis possibly began. I hope I don’t slip again. But I don’t feel I have complete control of my mind that its still being controlled by some source outside me.
175974670,"Stimulant abuse!! I only drink one coffee every morning now. I'm 4 days behind on Vyvanse but I stopped myself and taking as prescribed now. If my doctor doesn't forgive me, it will be taken away... It can't really be taken away though because I need it so at least it will be my mom that dispenses it again. But I stopped myself from going further so I'm proud of self."
175974671,For me it’s the opposite it’s so hard to go into the cold when you’re used to be warm most of the time. It’s different when your going to and from work and get used to the cold. I’m actually considering driving instead of walking...
175974672,Sorry she cancelled Hope you're able to figure out something fun to do with your mom

175974674,"From what i read we all should have abusive or neglectful parents, so 1. Do you recognize your abuse? Is the memory erased? 2. How are your family ties regarding the abuse, since it doesnt seem like a little bump in the relationship, our parents literally exiled us from the world, for me its unthinkable to forgive. My parents seemed to not know what abuse im talking about, when i look from the outside i gave little signs at the ages i can remember, but as i watched videos from family events i could see how unresponsive i was, i could see how my dad's touch (trying to kiss me) made me cry instantly at age 3.5, family always said im a attention seeking cryer. Im sure the signs were there for every schizoid, so can you still forgive? I cut ties with my family completely 2 months ago after they sent me to jail because i was trying to get back at them, i never really let go of what they did, i always wanted revenge as a kid, i always wanted to finally be the stronger person, and the way i saw it is stro
ngest person controls the house, but very conviniently for them its not socially accepted to seek revenge after age 13 because by their logic i wasnt supposed to be vengeful at this age, it stayed in me"

175974675,The crisis text person _NAME_ was helpful. Just felt good to let it out. She was very nice and told me that I’m a strong person getting through all this stuff. She suggested I try some self care and just reflect on the good things. I feel a bit better. Not as wild. Little calmer. Hopefully I can last until I talk to my doctor.

My anxiety and panic attacks are not out of control. My sleep is so much better, no more nocturnal seizures. My chrons has improved."

I am sorry you aren't well. Healing thoughts going out to you!! Hibee...you've got this!

175974696,"Relationships have always been rocky for me and I think to some extent, anxiety and relationships is normal. However when the anxiety and relationship takes over your day and changes your mood instantly, that’s when I realize it’s a problem. For example, a lot of my past relationships have driven me to overthink a lot of scenarios because when something changes parentheses like decreased communication or physical touch parentheses, that’s going to break up with typically happen. I’ve spent my whole life jumping from relationship to relationship where it ended up in break ups for various reasons that reinforced my conclusions. Now, I spent most of my days checking Snapchat or Facebook to see if he’s been active but is just not talking To me. If that’s the case, I typically go into a panic attack, cry profusely, refuse to eat, or post something passive aggressive because I think that he doesn’t want to talk to me, or worse, is talking to someone else. And thus, a break up is bound to ha
ppen. Is this an irrational fear? Could there be more to it? How do I control this?"
175974697,"Interesting read. I am drawn to stories of corrupt religious, cult leaders. Loved the documentary 'wild wild country'. I do understand how people, desperate to feel Love, find answers, can deny their instincts when they feel they have found someone to 'save them'. It is not so much the power of the cult leader as the desperation, need and vulnerability of his followers. Years ago I joined a meditation centre based on the yogi traditions. There was a lot of value / rewards in being part of it. I especially Loved the silent retreats but overall, it was tainted by a strong flavour of cultishness. I lasted a few months. ^^ This says it all."
175974698,I feel like I'm in hell
175974699,"Hi there, my heart goes out to you. The first time I remember feeling depressed was when I was a 4 th grader. I know everyone is different. If you feel that you have an Undiagnosed health condition you know yourself. I’m so sorry. Being sick or feeling despair doesn’t make you a failure. I think it makes you human. I’m glad that you have family and a daughter because that may be what keeps you going until you find the right help. Sending good thoughts."
175974700,Trying to not obsess about food but I want to try intermittent fasting. Eat whatever I want. Don't count calories. Try to be okay with it.

175974707,Therapy appointment went well. I'll be seeing her in person next time since I'll be in the clinic to see my psych NP that day anyway (they work in the same clinic)
175974708,Thanks SP and cupcakes are a good idea
175974709,Textbooks make me so mad
175974710,"Just calmly tell him what exactly what is happening to your mood in the afternoons almost every day. To your sick brain. We all know and none of us is the fracking pdoc. Calmly tell him prefrontal catecholamine help due to Vyvanse helps you greatly in staying out of suicidality and depresion tell him. Write it down if need be, so if he interrupts u, u do not lose your train of thought. If he still refuses, find a new pdoc. I believe in you, _PERSON_. I believe u can take it bid without abusing it. Do not let him fack u up. I know Adderall is widely available via other means. If he refusesto help u AND u cannot get a gd pdoc due to Canada's provider shortage, why no t get Adderall or Vyvanse from this other source annd add a second dose yourself. When my pdoc started not helping w SI enough, I obtained an NMDA antagonist that works and saved my own freaking life."
174367876,"Why is she fixated on DID, do you think? Just becuase you dissociate? Plenty of people do that and do not have DID, at least, I think so..."
175974711,"Haha that's scary lol I've never played Oblivion but the lock picking in Skyrim is somewhat difficult, it's kind of fun to do though"
175974712,I'm sorry you are feeling sick _AT_MENTION_. What does it feel like to have your brain fall out? Is your head hurting you? I sometimes feel like my brain is far heavier on the right side of my head than the left and when I get dissociated my head tends to fall in that direction. Don't know if that makes sense either but it is what it is.
175974713,"Yup, Yup, Yup."
175974714,"Let’s be honest here I want to learn everything. I’ll probably be 60 and still going for degrees and learning things hahaha. I’m even thinking in future of getting a Bachelors of Arts in something else. I’m getting a minor in Psychology right now, what if I decide to get a BA? What about finance? Get a degree in finance. Oh the possibilities. One of my friends said to me that none of it is a waste because I’m learning and always improving myself. Learn all things!"
175974715,"I see my doctor tomorrow for a Vyvanse refill. Then I see my psychiatrist in two weeks - I'll get the other refills from him + He said 1-2x of a ""short acting"" stimulant in the evening is no problem.. So I can sleep.. I'm not mentioning it to my doctor cuz I think he's incompetent about psychiatry.. He's a good doctor but has a big ego. Then I will be ok ^-; I've been managing to not take extra long acting stim in the evening - Even though I still fall asleep at the same time (11pm-12am) cuz I can't go a day without and have a limited supply. Work out your thought philosophically... There's always keys that are found by thinking about something long enough (Although can be exhausting), you can see what is real. I've killed people with my mind for example.. I'd like to use the power responsibly and not just kill anyone that I don't like.. But logically I know that there's no evidence for that."

175974718,I’m sorry To hear this and I totally understand. Have you tried taking melatonin? It’s a natural supplement that may help you. I also think the idea of writing down three items of gratitude every night is a great option to focus your thoughts.
175974719,"Agreed. But what do you call it when you finally do start, gain some momentum, maybe even get lost in the flow, and then...stop..? Staying on task seems to be more than 29% of the battle for me. I don't think it has anything to do with how I perceive my power of efficacy or the work itself. Sometimes I think my true calling is to just lie around and do nothing. That sounds like a joke, but it's not. I'm really good at doing nothing. It gives me a kind of peace I can't get elsewhere. I'm good with long term goals. They're long term. Plenty of time to start on them tomorrow...or in three months. About the last part...I think it's common to not just perform better under pressure, but perform only under pressure. Luckily I've learned not to generally give a ###$ what people think. There are exceptions, but I rarely feel the need to prove myself to someone I dislike. Or even to rivals, which I am thankfully in short supply of. I would get more satisfaction from proving to myself that I could do the work
. Saying see? I told you I could do it to someone seems to suggest that they have enough value that it's worth putting myself through hell just to prove something to them. ###$ them . Parental brainwashing can be undone. I'm just guessing here, but I'd say it helps to have some measure of contempt for the brainwasher. Then, once you figure out their motivation for brainwashing you and realize how petty it was, it becomes easier to see things clearly. Their motivation had nothing to do with you. It was just a way for them to achieve some control. Or an end. The passing of time helps with this as well. SO after nearly twenty five years I cracked open the four big boxes in the back of a closet that contain all my old writing and artwork. It was the writing I was after. I'm a better writer than a painter, and any creative recovery I embark on now will be solely about the writing. I think it would be foolish to attempt to rekindle both simultaneously. Besides, success with one may rub off on the other. The sketchb
ooks surprised me. Heavy metal shlt. At one point I illustrated _PERSON_ entire Caress Of Steel album (just spent an entire two minutes wrestling with whether or not I should admit I did that). As for the paintings (also a lot of acrylics), I stare at them and think HOW THE PHUCK DID I DO THAT???????? . Probably not a good attitude. But in going through the writing, of which there are thousands of pages, something weird happened: I felt like writing. There was a lot of good stuff I'd forgotten about, including ideas. Having not been exposed to it for literally decades, it opened up a sense of urgency and possibility. I'm thinking this may be an important key. The right tool I need to break the ice that separated me from not only my will to write, but my need to write. That need is the secret. Now I am afraid of all those pages because if they do indeed hold the key to some sort of block, I don't want to misuse it. I don't want it to become infected with the apathy that has crept over so many other aspects of 
my life. But at the same time, I don't want to dump it in the ''long term goal'' category. I've been scouting out Writer's Forums and I think I've found one that could be of some help. Perhaps a short tenure there will help light the pilot. Until I get banned. As for the painting, I'm thinking I might just splash some colors on a sheet of paper and see what happens. I've been looking at abstract watercolor stuff and I think I could get into that. Oddly, a lot of abstract stuff annoys me, but it's hard to be pretentious with watercolor. Thanks for the pep talk. It will come in handy. There might be more to it than discipline. I don't know where the dissociation comes from, or if there are triggers. I do suspect taking klonopin doesn't help. It seems to get worse in the evenings after my dose when it's highest in my bloodstream. As for the movie, I won't comment because it's my second favorite of all time and if I begin talking about it, I will never stop. Is there a limit to how long a post can be? It's also b
een said that having long term goals is good for the immune system. For longevity of life in general, if that's your thing. And it is mine. Just like they have ""dog years"", someone needs to come up with the concept of ""schizoid time"". I've accomplished in the past ten years what most people get through in one. Interesting what you're saying about the damming-up of creative energy. I take good care of myself physically, and am always trying to do the same mentally, but I still feel there's something missing. Can you point me to someplace where this idea is explored a bit? Chinese philosophy has always made a great deal of sense to me, but I dread plunging into the miasma of googling it. Who knows where I might end up? Besides, I've given up search engines for a week."
175974720,"Yeah that’s what I’m worried about, hopefully he’s just sleeping in or something....."
175974721,How is everyone doing today???

It's very reassuring to know that you have had regular tests due to your previous stroke and all the tests come back normal. Have you had a history of migraines? I had a telephone appointment a few months ago and the neurologist mentioned that it was likely due to constant migraine auras. Just wondering if your neurologist has mentioned anything similar? _NAME_"

175974728,"So it’s just nausea but you’re mentally fine? That’s good then. I’m glad you’re doing better. I don’t know what happened to me nor how I did it but I have motivations most of the time now (like about 4-5 days a week), after years of feeling demotivated and numb."
175974729,Watching The Good Place
175974730,"Avoidance - a defensive measure to reduce the risk of rejection, accountability, criticism or exposure. Yes this is a big one for me. I unconsciously withdraw when i start to feel uncomfortable. In relationship i have to force myself to communicate if i'm detecting that the issue is important. Belittling, Condescending and Patronizing I dont do that. Chronic Broken Promises I try not to make promises in the first place. But that makes me come across as avoidant. Circular Conversations I try not to get into arguments. I hate conflict. I'll only push my viewpoint if i believe the issue is important enough to warrant it. Cognitive Dissonance Not that i can think of Confirmation _PERSON_ I'm human so there is probably some. ""Control-Me"" Syndrome no Denial I dont think so. However i dont usually get worked up about people wronging me unless it was a big deal. Dependency Schizoids being loners and self sufficient i would think would make them the opposite of a dependent. Depression Yes. But its more de
spondency. I'm not sad. I'm unmotivated by life and find everything to be a chore. Dissociation- Not substantially. But this is one area i havent explored much. Entitlement No. Just the opposite. I'm self sufficient. Escape To Fantasy For me its escape to nothingness. I like sleep. I like clearing my mind and dwelling on nothing. That makes the world go away. I also like reading and movies. They put my existance on hold. Feelings of Emptiness Yes _PERSON_ No Identity Disturbance No Imposed Isolation Yes. By choice. Invalidation low self esteem - yes. Lack of Conscience - No - that would be narcissism Low Self-Esteem - Yes Masking No Neglect - Neglect is a passive form of abuse in which the physical or emotional needs of a dependent are disregarded or ignored Not by intent. But this supposes you have a dependent in the first place; something a schizoid would try to avoid. ""Not My Fault"" Syndrome No. I take responsibility. But i try and minimise the number of things i can be held accountable for. Objectificat
ion No Pathological Lying No Projection No. I am empathic. Selective Memory and Selective Amnesia No Selective Competence A bit. I will downplay my competence if it means i can avoid something i dont want to do. Stunted Emotional Growth Of course. Its a consequence of having a PD. Tunnel Vision No I think the list is a pile of rubbish. The author has taken traits from just about every personality disorder and lumped them all in together."
175974731,I've never been this psychologically exhausted in my life
175974732,"Yeah I've heard there are different types of stimulants. I've taken stimulants before. Don't remember if they helped or not in the past. Anyway, I'm just really sick of this wavering stuff. On decisions I have to make and what not."

Afterwards, I slept and woke up then prepared for tomorrow's lessons. I feel great. I went outside for a walk and up the stairs again. Life is not bad. However, I am expected to show up at the teaching center starting in July. I hope I don't get sick!! We have to wear masks but still. I am not sure how safe it is. I am doing well otherwise.

I called, already worried. He said his truck got broken into while he was working. Someone busted the windows, the Locks, and busted the ignition. And he had to call a wrecker to get him and his truck home. To say I was scared and devastated is an understatement. When I heard all that, my heart dropped to my stomach."
175974743,"TimTam, Adderall doesn't act as a stimulant for her because she is adhd. When you are adhd, you don't get a stimulant effect. Just incase you didn't realize. The raripiprazole is something I take and I am not bi-polar. I take it for mood stabilizer. Though it is used for bi-polar and as you said anti-psychotic.

175974753,"I took 100mg Seroquel last night. I should have taken 50mg because the 150mg Invega Sustenna injection kicked in this morning. I took a 50mg Vyvanse this morning, went back to sleep and my god I was knocked out, woke up an hour later but had to get up cuz I'm doing things today. What helps you personally or what can help you with the sedation? I always like my racing thoughts at the end of the injection - Cool, interesting thoughts. But I get stressed which isn't good for the brain as it can lead to psychosis. So I need antipsychotic. I'm going for a walk this morning. So what helps me is; - Light exercise (A little bit because it's hard to motivate self while sedated) - Stimulation (People to talk to that don't judge your zombie state, caffeine, stimulants like ADHD medication - Rarely people with psychosis can take stimulants but I can which doesn't really help on day 1 of injection) - Watching TV (I know... Vegetating watching TV... At least we can absorb some sort of information..) - Keeping bu
sy (Having a job or part time job - Likely this isn't good for volunteering because we have to be social which is hard while sedated) - Sleep (Would suck to be on a high dose of antipsychotic every day because that's basically what we do.. Sleep.. It's a literal nightmare) - Music and podcasts (Even though we can't really feel emotions in sound - Like TV, it's absorbing a slight amount of information) - Idk what else. Leave in comments below what else you have in mind..."

174367925,"It's good that you alert _NAME_ his psychiatrist to his manic symptoms so she could change his diagnosis from depression to manic-depression or bipolar. Why they don't ask a depressed patient if they ever have a racing mind, to see if they might be manic depressed, not just depressed, I don't know. By miss-diagnosing him she miss-medicated him by giving him only an anti-depressant (Zoloft) which threw him into mania (""he became super happy"") by not giving him a stabilizer like Lithium which would prevent that. That's why the diagnosis is so important. For my bipolar, I take Mirtazapine anti-depressant and Lithium for a stabilizer, but I did have to go through the requisite 10 years of being miss-diagnosed as only depressed, which included panic attacks from being given only an anti-depressant. You said, ""He was put on Resperidone at lowest dose. He’s still also taking the Zoloft, 50mg. He hasn’t had a blow up and seems to be less agitated. Otherwise he still has to constantly be doing someth
ing and nothing else has changed."" rxlist.com says Risperdal (risperidone) is an atypical antipsychotic prescribed to treat schizophrenia, bipolar mania and autism. Side effects included: sudden, often jerky, involuntary motions of the head, neck, arms, body, or eyes. They also include restlessness, anxiety, sleep problems (insomnia). So your ""he still has to constantly be doing something and nothing else has changed"" equals to ""restlessness"" and ""anxiety."" I took an anti-psychotic for bi-polar for a year off and on. I had to constantly be moving. If I sat down to eat, I had to tap my foot (movement). It was torture. I couldn't think a thought, my mind was blank or moving to fast to do that. Anti-psychotics have improved in the past 20 years or more. But if you husband ""still has to constantly be doing something and nothing else has changed"" I equate that to the anti-psychotic which I took and it was torture. I'm sure they've improved but I do think that's what his the constant movement is about . An
d if there is no change in his behavior from no stabilizer, only an anti-depressant, he could be on the wrong stabilizer. Amateur opinion. I take Lithium for a stabilizer and there is another one or two, I think. You also note, ""I’m losing hope that he will ever appreciate me and the kids and show love toward us. I’m sick with Lyme disease and currently in depression and he has no empathy what so ever. I deal with my illnesses completely alone. I miss having a partner in life and not just a roommate with a very busy life who’s hardly ever here. Hope you guys can give me some encouragement..."" One thing I might say is try to stay positive, as the resources above the names on each forum also suggest. If his stabilizer is not working, you might want to suggest to the psychiatrist that she try another one."
175974771,Hey y'all having second thoughts now about the stupid IOP program. I don't know if I need it. I can't afford it. Ha. It's so freaking expensive I don't even want to think about it.
175974772,"getting by said... Hi TMO, In actuality, you poisoned yourself with vodka. That is what happens if you over do it drinking. Hangovers are no fun and I don't remember you talking about the headache you often get when hungover. I don't think with over drinking just once will give you any health issues. But daily drinking does in time. I just lost my sister in law to liver disease from drinking daily for many years. I lost a sister (in her 40's) years ago from alcohol abuse. So if I were you, I wouldn't drink much. Alcohol is also a depressant, so daily drinking will make you depressed which is no fun especially on top of anxiety. You are young, I hope you decide not to drink. It is a matter of choice I guess. I have drank in my life, had many hang overs and did throw up on occasion. I don't miss it at all. Choose wisely. I hope you are feeling better today. Hugs, _NAME_... I didn’t have any headaches but the lingering nausea was there. I think I drank too much too fast. I never drink daily. Maybe a 
glass of whiskey in the evening but I don’t over do it. I will be going dry for a month until Sunday 26 April. Could you help me stay accountable and on track towards this goal?"

175974774,"As a painter, I work with a lot of interior decorates. My boss does a lot of assistance with what the client wants. A lot of it pivots on the mind set one has regarding what the purpose of the room is, and how the customer wants to interpret it as. I could never be an interior decorated; I could never tell a person what they want in a room. Usually, with painting, you want a white ceiling with white trim, and a lighter color to make the room seem bigger, with an accent wall that adds some pizazz which connects with the customer's heart. But that's just the case typically, at least for painters. Personally, I stay way from accent walls when painting my own rooms. I enjoy uniformity and a certain crispness. For instance, instead of an accept wall I would place my 3 book shelves there with a large plant."

Ive been like this for too long....5 years is so long. Its not fair that Im living like this while my husband works. I dont even know what ""being in my head"" means anymore because I feel like they are one in the same now for me. Everyone keeps telling me if i just get a job all of this would go away....I guess I feel like I did this to myself because I wasnt always like this....but over time my lack of a schedule etc became bad for me.

175974785,One of mine nicknamed me Motor.
174367940,It took me a while to realize when things were not alright. My memories pretty much try to sugar coat it because my mom refuses to listen to it and basically tell me that I didn't have it that bad. I told my mom my dad locked up in a bedroom without food and other important necessities. They lived in a one bedroom apartment with 3 kids 4 if you add me at the time and my stepmom and dad. Then my mom tried to hide and act like the sexual abuse didn't happen to me from age 2 or 3 until I was like 7 years old. Then there's taking care of my grandmother when I was 14 until I was 17 years old while my mom took her anger out on me. Eventually my mental health problems started to rise and she pretty much said I was doing it for attention. I get what you're coming from and it's frustrating and sometimes the mind makes things seem not so bad to protect the mind from what was really bad.
175974786,That's a good idea but I think zombies can climb trees now.

I feel like it stems from my dad letting me buy multiple things at one time since I was a kid. We’d go somewhere like the grocery or to get something, and I’d like one item but I would tell my dad idk which one I want cuz I like this other item. And then he’d tell me to get both if I want to."

Hard to pinpoint exactly what’s helped but I think cutting down my alcohol/starting drinking later, the nicer weather, getting up earlier and socialising a bit as well as well as most likely being off APs for a bit. I mean I’ve done okay on them the past couple of years but they always drain motivation a little regardless. Tomorrow I am going to stay with my parents for a week. Looking forward to it.

I've never seen anything with better reviews. I researched it for my mom and apparently meds are blocking a major neurotransmitter in the brain called ""glutamate"". Lithium naturally regulates it. It's possible we are deficient in lithium because it's not in our water or veggies because of soil depletion etc. All I know is instead of all of the nasty side effects and feeling like a zombie, this may actually be helping people feel like normal humans. I just wanted to share because my mom's bipolar affected my family's life in a terrible way and if we had known about this I can only imagine how different our lives would've been.

175974827,"Hi there, I have met a girl who told me on our first date that she is schizo-affective. I was not concerned and didn't feel like that should be a reason as to why we should stop talking. We connected on an intellectual and creative level sharing our love of books and art film. The first date went well but the next couple of days became strange to me. Now, I'm very new to Schizo-affective disorder and I'm extremely understanding and compassionate. I'm eager to learn what I can in order to know how to be supportive while still being respectful and allowing her to be her own person. I am going to describe the next few days from an uneducated perspective and end with what I have learned from reading material online and watching videos on YouTube of people with the condition. We went on a second date later that week and I noticed she was withdrawn, quiet, and extremely distant. We sat next to each other and didn't speak and when I brought up topics to discuss she gave one word answers. I asked if everyt
hing was okay and she stated she had something on her mind. I said okay. The night progressed and I felt rejected and as if she didn't want to be there. I asked numerous times thoughout the night what she was thinking about and it was answered everytime with a response I didn't expect, such as, ""I need more vape juice"" or ""I am looking forward to reading when I go home"". I became deflated. It was as if she was not there and was a completely different person from who she was on our first date. She was still receptive to me holding her hand and we exchanged kisses. I thought it was me and she was just ready to go home. A few times when I mentioned topics to talk about she would respond sharply with a ""No."" Or a slightly insulting comment. I ended the date abruptly, and drove her home. On the ride home I stated that she had been distant all night and the tension was very thick. I asked if she wanted to hit me because I felt she was annoyed with me. She said no, but that we are on different wavelengths and 
that I didn't let her just be herself. She said she just wanted to go home and read her books and I was stressing her out. I said okay, well we can go our separate ways. I dropped her off and I have been left with so many questions that I turned to the internet to learn more about schizo-affective. I have learned that there is a ""flat affect"" and people can become distant, emotionless, and withdrawn. I have learned that there are voices that can combat with a person while they are attempting to do basic actions. I have learned that stress can be a trigger to an episode. I am now hurt and dissapointed with myself for not putting two and two together but I did not know of these additional side effects. She takes medication. She has told me her last boyfriend ever things due to her having an episode. My question is pretty deep and I want to do the right thing. I have not spoken with her in 5 days, and I want to reach out and apologize stating I've done some research and I believe I misinterpreted her actions. 
I don't know if it will be recieved in a friendly manner, if I will cause more stress by contacting her again since we agreed to go our separate ways, or if this is the begging of an episode. If it is the beginning of an episode, I want to help and be there but at the same time I do not know her that well so I fear I may trigger delusions in her where she would think I'm something I'm not. I also do not want to act as if I am someone in her life when I'm not causing her to be more upset with me. Should I call? Should I text? Should I wait for her to reach out? Should I call in a few weeks? I only want to apologise and work to move forward learning what I can about this and what I am allowed and not allowed to do given that I am new person in her life. Thank you in advance"

Today at school I was actually not freaking out as bad as last week so maybe it’s a start hopefully down a better path. Thank you very much for reaching out as it means a lot to me _AT_MENTION_. Hopefully soon i should be better and can figure out the future and my mental health. :)"

175974858,"I'm doing pretty good _AT_MENTION_. Just been chilling today at work. Mostly rocking back and forth in my chair but I also read a lot out of Psalm from the Bible. I did work when it got put on my desk but not a lot has come by honestly. So it would have been a pretty boring day if I hadn't done some reading. Still have about an hour and a half left of work. Then tonight I have a call with my case manager. I don't know if she is going to graduate me tonight or wait until next time. I'm doing pretty good, I think she will feel happy with how I'm doing. I'm down to seeing Pastor _PERSON_ only every other week. So I guess I need less support right now. I definitely think the meds are helping me. Just dealing with some hallucinations and stuff but they aren't as bad as before. I'm glad you got new shoes and a crock pot. That's nice. I like cooking in a crock pot. It's just so much easier than cooking any other way. We are either having spaghetti tonight or dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets left over from

Got a little bitty bit of cleaning done, too. Just a tad. Tried to work on the novel--I am in the middle of editing one book that is finished and writing another--and it was pathetic. Just could not muster any interest, which is very concerning for me. Writing is like, my whole life. Or most of it. Oh well, maybe tomorrow. We shall see. Not as paranoid today, so that is good.

I also carried a rescue dose of klonopin withme at all times but since I started celexa my anxiety is pretty much non existent. don't need the rescue dose any more. from what I can see from your posts dependency isn't a problem and I hope your dr can see this as well as you are not always asking for it. unfort drs are being very restrictive with zanax now. be carefull about going to another dr for it as you may be accused of dr shopping and all records are shared among drs now .
175974864,How do you feel about that? I was honestly shocked when my Pdoc diagnosed me with ADHD. He said I have the inattentive type which makes sense because I do make a lot of stupid mistakes on paperwork and stuff even though I don't have trouble getting my work done.

175974870,"Our strength comes from inside of ourselves that is reinforced by the support we get by the people around us. But, the support is not detrimental to your strength. You are in command. I have had to establish which of my relatives and the people of my past are good for me also the ones that are toxic. I've literally had to let people know who I want on the other side of my mountain and who I do not. As hard as it is to tell people that you still love in your heart you don't want them there because they trigger ill effects in you, surprisingly once it was over and I had told them I found it very empowering and felt very good about myself. Nothing in this world is as important as your mental health, your physical health, your stability and how you feel about yourself. If others don't agree, if others don't see that, if others want to have their own opinion of you, let them. But, the opinion that matters is yours. You got this.

175974871,"Possible trigger: My mom seems overwhelmed, they might not do the surgery on the 23rd for a couple reasons and she’s just freaking out. It’s like her whole life is centered on getting rid of the cancer. I don’t think she realizes that she’s stage four or what that really means. It’s just a matter of time, all they can do is slow it down not stop it. I told her if they don’t do the surgery it’s so they give you more time....it’s because they don’t want to kill you with the surgery if you’re not in good enough health for it. I don’t know what the psychology is for cancer but I feel like she would benefit from someone who would talk to her about what her condition means and how to deal with it. She doesn’t want to see a therapist though, I’m not sure why."

175974887,I suggest you contact another dr if you really are not bothered by having a check-up and ask them everything in your mind. I think in your case some tests may give reassurance. You absolutely need to focus on other things in life but I also know that the social distancing and staying at home is not helping. People with health anxiety have control issues and have big problems with uncertainty. It is a very complicated anxiety disorder and may have many hard to detect causes that lie beneath. Ask for professional help in the form of therapy and The dr will guide you. Don't leave health anxiety unaddressed.

Also I fluently wrote this little poem in a minute; Inside me lays a little psychosis A little madness No one knows this And I hope it passes When I research conspiracies, I put on my glasses Drink some whiskeys And smoke some hashes If only I could see the whole truth, I could save the world But I suffer in pain every day And it's all my fault (It's inspired by my dads friend that had weed psychosis showing me chemtrails and such and said ""Do you think I like annoying myself with my thoughts?""). I should write more prose poems but I write a little every day and then immediately do something else. I wish I spent more time writing."
175974890,"I totally get it! Between what my mother was going through hospitalized in the same hospital I ended up in at the same time with my own problems and trying to manage both of our care I felt like I saw every doctor that worked there. It was such a life changing time for me and prompted me to really rearrange how my life is structured but even know it’s an ongoing process. Maybe you could ask one of your docs if there is a social worker or counselor that could help guide you? Things that I found that helped me what getting a good planner with lots of space, writing everything down setting up some kind of schedule, using colored pens for different types of tasks, and making small flexible goals for each week and check in days to see how things were going. Drawing a diagram might help too. I saw a doctor recently online had a diagram of how to get moving forward with life/what worked for him. I’ll have to see if I can find it because it was a nice visualization. And off course we are all here to of

175974903,"I'm sorry to hear that. She might have to have a collapse of some kind before her way of life looks bad to her. I had to have a nervous breakdown before I knew what to do: I had to see a psychiatrist. But I'm thinking, if I had had somebody there by myside, encouraging me to get an appointment, saying, here's the name of a psychiatrist, just call and get an appointment, and see what the psychiatrist says. You don't have to take any medicine. Just get the doctor's opinion. I think that would have helped. After the break, In my fantasy, that would have been what I believed would have helped. If I had just had somebody advising me. You might still want to get the name of a psychiatrist, in case one is needed, you'll have a name right there. Perhaps a name to give to your daughters in case they see a situation where one is needed, and your wife agrees, but she doesn't know who to call. I know at some point in my case, I thought, well, I know I need a psychiatrist, but who do I call? In my manic/depress
ed state, I couldn't make decisions. I also wasn't positive I could solve the problem, I was negative, and it turned out negative. So you might want to get the name of a psychiatrist in case it is ever needed. Deep down, she probably wants some help."

175974914,"I don't think this is perfectly on topic, but it just happened yesterday and I wanted to put it ""somewhere."" Friend of mine from years and years ago, around college era, keeps calling me on game chat things. Relatively infrequently, and usually I have to tell him I'm going to work or something, but I'm not too particularly perturbed. One day he calls me on a different gaming service than usual, and apparently he doesn't even know it's me. He's just contacting this account out of the blue and chatting it up, and I'm only typing to him but he's talking via the voice thing. And looking at what games I play. And I'm not aware he doesn't know it's me at first. And I make some comments like how do you not realize I played blah? Well this christmas I went on a bit of a bender, very painful, and he chats me up and we talk and I'm more chatty than usual. I've known his life is not going good, but it's all really his own fault. He has always lived by some weird hedonistic lifestyle of extreme laziness, sle
eping with anything he can get a chance with, smoking a lot of weed, and running out on anything difficult. Quit the Navy. Gets fired from or quits every job. Blah blah blah. I tell him I just want to keep playing my games, and if he wants to hang out with me, he should just play that game. He says he has no money. I say ""I'll just buy you some game time for christmas, it's not a big deal. If you want to play you can play. Up to you."" I do so. He plays some. Meanwhile his conversations with me are all gross. As I mentioned, I was heavily intoxicated, and I said I was really disgusted with myself, how my skin felt, how I smelled, etc. And he was way too personally interested in it in a way that maybe is his sense of humor, but it creeped me out. He also was telling me things like he visited a mosque and ""those people are different"" and I told him don't go around messing with other people's religions... So he plays for 3 days, and he is constantly wanting my attention, and I'm really busy because I have a m
illion things I need to do as I recover from that bender, go to work, and play this game very seriously. But not just that, he has to constantly be insulting me and saying $#%^ in this guild-space about how I am not as competent at this game as I think I am (when he hasn't played with me in years and these people all depend on me regularly). At one point he starts asking what kind of guild it is and I say ""mostly an adults with jobs and kids kind of guild"". He then asks if there are any single women and I say, ""I don't know, I don't really worry about that kind of thing."" Then he says ""I'll find them out."" And I tell him that we are not that kind of guild, we don't have that kind of drama, we're here to play the game and have a good time. And also anything racist or offensive in general or whatever is not welcome here. We're here to play the game, hang out about the game, etc. And the constant berating of me doesn't bother me as a one-off thing. ""Ha ha, you suck."" But what he doesn't get is in this gu
ild and on this server I have a very good reputation. People are super happy to get me in a group. I never create drama. I'm a little bit funny. I've got some minor memes going on about me, all in a good-natures way. Gaming for me is where I get to be kinda normal cause I can take it at my pace. All I ever want to do is game. He has to keep beating that bush though. I think it's because, all things considered, my life worked out alright and he is feeling really really down on himself. He told me at one point that he feels too stupid to do the things he wants to do. I think maybe he always thought he was ""better"" than me or something, though I guess I wasn't aware of it. Or something else. I couldn't totally figure him. On day 3 I demote him to our ""time out"" rank for all of 1 minute after a comment insulting me, which got various hoots and hollars from my guildmates. Then I promoted him back. And the guild is used to this, we had it happen twice in a night tonight. It's mostly used for things like ""oh no 
_NAME_ bought all the herbs on the AH before I could!"" and it's the most minor of hazing. But after he had insulted me hundreds of times over a couple days and constantly seemed to want my attention and to voice chat, I did this one thing. Then, for reasons I won't speculate at specifically, he quits the guild. Later that night he tries to voice chat me again and I just ignore it. He hasn't logged in this game since, but other games, so I wish him well. If he wanted to just play the game, I'd be glad to play with him, but I don't want to feel like I'm being used as someone's punching bag/ego nurse/attention object/etc."
175974915,So me and my guys wife are like friends now I guess. It’s great and I love hanging out and chatting. But she’s a phone person. This is horrifying for me. I do not do phones like ever. We just chatted on the phone for 27 minutes. Kill me I’m overwhelmed.

175974926,A little over 5 hours at work today and then I can go home and start my three day weekend. I so need a break.

175974931,What's up _AT_MENTION_?
175974932,"I'm taking monday off so I have a 3 day weekend. Ahhh. Tomorrow I see my sister for the first time in 6 years. Possible trigger: Her estranged husband committed suicide. Mental illness is a *****. It's a sad occassion but I'm still happy to see her. I have a date on sunday which I'm very nervous about. My date told me she's been quiet with me because she had a really awesome date and she typically gets quiet with other guys when she feels a ""strong connection"" So now i have that hanging over my head as we go on our first date. I'm actually a bit upset because now that hangs over the date, i have no clue what she was thinking but that was definitely too much info. I hope i can be myself with the expectation now. The new _NAME_ swift album is great, it's dark, stormy, more sincere, less popy, i recommend it. I'm not a fan of anything else she has done but I heard a song played on NPR All Songs Considered and loved it."
175974933,"I feel that. I take care of myself mentally but I eat like **** and barely exercise, not a good idea."
175974934,"Question for you folks. My roommate's brother has confessed that if he killed anyone he'd have no remorse. He was treated unjusticely by a former employer and so he can't get another job if he lists them as a former employer. Also he gets angered, and has had hallucinations. When I'm around him I've seen him flip out about his injustice, and in other situations he yells while having a casual conversation. He's vvery smart, has a PhD, but cannot for the life of him get a job to use it. He's not going to buy a gun, but since he doesn't have access to pot (which he self-medicates with) he has outbursts of rage, for instance, he keyed his car with, ""(F)uck you God"" on the back fender. He was so riled up when he had a job with google maps, that he purposely broke his phone because of frustration. He had a tablet, and he purposely broke that too. So now he's even more frustreated because he can't deliver flowers anymore without GPS. Does anyone have an idea of what could be going on here?"
175974935,"Arguably, relatively few people know first-hand what COVID-19 looks like in the lab and even fewer know how it originated. I do not presume to be one of those people. The idea of COVID-19 as an engineered disease is my speculation. Nonetheless, the gist of what I've read in the linked article and elsewhere is that the number of COVID-19-related deaths is eclipsed by the number of deaths from ""seasonal"" influenza, and that those who have perished came from the same populations victimized by the flu, e.g., the very young, the very old, and those with compromised immune systems. The two COVID-19-related deaths in Italy occurred with people in their 80s. I remember my mother observing, when she was ""caring"" for my late grandfather and thinking of how to speed him on his way, ""'They' typically don't do autopsies on people who die in their eighties."". This was in the US. Maybe the same goes for other countries? It's interesting that the idea of maintaining ""social distance"", thanks to COVID-19, d
iscourages live conversation, which happens to be one of the few remaining ways of communicating which is poorly monitored electronically. Why oh why did I not learn how to smoke-signal when I had the chance?"

175974943,"Me too! Which books did you get? I bought some hamann, vico, and herder which talk about the subject of poetry and I also bought some Pound and _PERSON_ who are poets. =) Oh i also bought a biography of _NAME_, and a biography on _PERSON_, and another weird book on goethe's works. It's called Essential Goethe, but it's just a compilation of this and that which maybe the amateur would be impressed but I'm not at all. _PERSON_ part 1 but not part 2? No _PERSON_? Fragments of this and that. I have no idea what basis this editor went by to put this large book together. I'd rather he just make it a book on _PERSON_ works with excessive quotes, but honestly, that's asking a life time of study, and this was surely more convenient to just smash what a passerby would find eye-catching."

Your heart breaks yet you ARE loved ~ and destiny has a way of working things out if given a chance. Give yourselves time to discover new options.. time is the key here. I have supported others who have talked about challenges of growing up in strict families and dealing with expectations of arranged marriages (and parents dealing with ideas of mixed marriages.. tough for sure.) One friend is an independent young woman who continues dating her guy though her parents visit her in the US each year and encourage other ""interests""... she loves her parents, and she is happy... Times are changing and for parents who want the best for daughters and sons (ok, and for their family as a whole) your struggle is not uncommon (yeah, I know that doesn't help much eh?) Do you have a strong family structure nearby? Or a close relative or friend who can provide positive 
council? Reaching out helps, but I also know it is hard to share.. so easily friends who know you both may play into the drama side. Posting here has helped me sometimes, so good choices so far! Stay strong, be fair to yourself. You got this:-) Blessings to you!"
175974945,"I have used CBD for anxiety, and it did seem to help me, but from what I understand, you have to use it everyday as the effects aren’t instant. Your body slowly becomes acclimated to it. You slowly notice the effects of the CBD. At least that’s how it is for me. I definitely think it’s worth a shot though. There’s not really any way it could harm him/her, just make sure you find a high quality product. Good luck!"

175974946,Ha it says I’ve already saved roughly $23. I put it at roughly $50 a week I would spend on alcohol. Lately I would go to the liquor store probably every two weeks and spend about $100 or so. So yeah. I likely was drinking way too much and it was contributing more to my mania. But it just felt FUN to go have some drinks. Ah well. Maybe I can drink in moderation again one day but for now while I’m getting used to the lithium and managing my mood it’s going to be zero. I like thinking about the dollar amount saved considering I’m trying to pay off debt right now.
175974947,"My mom is like that too. If we talk on the phone, she will unload all her problems on me. I got tired of it one day and set a boundary. So now we just text or email.

Did you stay on the other 3 medicines? Are you doing OK? Yes I'm still on the lithium 1,200 mg, latuda 40 mg, and doxepin 250 mg nightly. I'm doing okay, thanks.

175974968,"Since I've upped my lithium from two times a day to three times a day I've felt a little lightheaded. Especially when I stand up. I had a bit of a foggy head lately as well, even before upping the meds. I mentioned to the doctor on Monday and he said yeah, that happens. Guess I just gotta wait to get used to the increase. Makes me not want to be active. I was going to start doing at least a bit of activity. Maybe 30 minutes of biking a day. But I got up from my chair after work was over and I felt lightheaded and now I don't want to do anything. Part of me wonders if it might be a little bit to do with anxiety. I would get dissociative before with my anxiety and it always felt floaty. Sort of similar. IDK. I was on Lexapro to help my anxiety and it was helping, but I had to go off of it when I got manic. All these med changes messing with me making me feel out of sorts. But hey at least my mood is getting normalized."

175974974,"I am thinking about going off my meds for good. They have done nothing but cause me harm. I am tired of playing the psychiatrist - patient game. I am still seeing a therapist, but I hate this stuff. Why can't others be actually helpful? I know I'm probably in a bad mood right now. But this is getting ridiculous. Why do I feel this way? I feel helpless. I've never felt like this before. I feel like quitting like 8 things I'm doing right now. But it's all linked to that feeling of helplessness that I have. I wish I had listened to my intuitions when I thought I should never be on medication or when I thought of going off of meds like 86 times before. And now, I am just considering it. It is really hard to even consider because my life has been basically governed by the psychiatrist's rule and whatever he wants me to do for years now. Why can't there be another way? I wish there were another way. I think there is. I always am talked out of it. I don't know, I'll probably change my mind tomorrow. I wis

Just thinking about it almost makes me break out in shingles. Hence the working only under pressure. realizing how petty and illogical it was. It's helpful just 'meeting' people who have somehow managed to survive without giving a shlt what other's think. a way for them to achieve some control Thank you. This helps me to realize that the brainwashing lacked any intrinsic value. Changing the circumstances revealed the brainwashing as a liability. Nothing truly useful would lose its functionality so easily. It was was a cheap manipulation to make my family look good in an admittedly sick environment.

I have a hard time concentrating. Therefore, a hard time reading. So I've largely given up reading, and just think. It simply makes sense to me that shlt isn't meant to stagnate, because we're living systems. Used to live alongside a stream. Certain areas on the edge of the stream would stagnate, be coated with multi-color mini oil slicks, or start to stink and breed mosquitoes. Stagnation = bad. Flow = good. Written philosoph

175974976,"Thank you for your reply SilverTrees. I mentioned that I want to move to another state. I know she was just trying to be cautious and helpful, but I run scared every time I bring up any goal of mine. She said I should probably wait to see how the economy will go. What happens if I lose social services that I need. What happens if I have a MI crisis. What happens if that MI crisis scares the people I come to know in the new city and they don't want to help or support me. Honestly, it was the idea that people would be too scared to be around me that got me the most. I already struggle to not feeling like a fatally flawed burden that no one should touch with a 40 foot pole. It's hard to dare to dream that I can do even the smallest thing when I'm constantly worried that I can't manage anything that life requires. Some times I feel like I'll live and die having done nothing at all because I was too afraid to make the slightest move. Some times I feel like I can only reach for the bare minimum because I

175974982,"I agree with _PERSON_. My daughter does not want to look at the therapist so she simply talks to her on the phone- no zoom or anything like that. That may be an option for you. Maybe get your mom to help you pick out some therapists that possibly the insurance will cover. If not, I guess your parents would pay for each visit? We looked for a Christian counselor because of our beliefs. We were fortunate to find one. We went thru NewLife. They were so kind and helpful. Trying to find a counselor was hard for me to do because my other two kids never needed it. but my last child, a teen, definitely had major anxiety going on and it was having negative effects on her daily living and school. The counseling is helping. So don’t be afraid. You can do it and you will be so glad you did. Just take it one step at a time. Your life is a beautiful gift that is worth living."
175974983,"Your symptoms are classic to a mixed mood bi polar disorder that comes in both variants, and a lot in bp2. Mixed mood for me is all over the shop, and in various blocks, minutes hours etc, it can be in mania or in a depressive component. Some have mixed mood, some will rapid cycle, some will crash, some will become hypomanic, in the mixed mood it is more of the sum of parts that are pronounced by us, than just up then down. A shrink trained in bi polar disorders is a must, some are just general shrinks, like a general doctor with a basic understanding of many things. Bi polar is one of the most recognised complex mental health disorders, along with BPD. If your shrink is not a consultant psychiatrist then i would seek further info. Hoping i have been helpful. I live with mixed mood bi polar disorder and this is my diagnosis, HT"
175974984,"I'm not one for prayer, but I do believe in the ability of therapy, meds and ongoing support to help. It's no straight line, there are set backs, but there's potential for progress. I've suggested this so many times to people I should get a fee! I suggest downloading the audiobook, The Transformation: Discovering Wholeness and Healing After Trauma, by _NAME_, and listening to one chapter at a time. Maybe one a day or every other day. And throw yourself into it. Do the exercises. It's wonderful. It feels good, and it connects to others who have moved through trauma and depression/anxiety to achieve some peace and freedom from pain. I hope you also take advantage of all the free online support groups. I am in one. It's just life saving. Good luck."

I can relate as I also suffer with chronic pain and anxiety and one effects the other I like to use Mindfulness Meditation which helps with both anxiety and pain have a look at our resources section for some good links to self help sites on the web. With regards to medication I would suggest that there are better options than amitriptyline such as Cymbalta (Duloxetine) which is really good for anxiety and pain so maybe speak with your doctor about this. Keep us posted. _PERSON_
175974987,"Anyone try any of this VR chat or similar things? I have not yet, but I fell into the rabbit hole of watching youtube videos (first humorous) of people playing in these online games. Right now, and in the past, I've been a bit of an MMO junkie. I play really heavily, usually in a mid-tier guild where I'm the strongest or among the strongest players, but I tend to mostly stay off voice and chatting until raid time. It's a lot of work, but since they made Classic I've been really happy knowing there's a finite end to the game and the rat race eventually ends. It's a lot like finally being given what I wanted. These VR chat things, from what I've seen, seem very oriented towards younger people and certain kinds of socialization. That said, I have a few ideas I'd really like to try, though with my skill set that might be expensive. 1) I kinda want to make some of my ""inner worlds"". Like build them as levels. Hang out in them. And if I so choose, invite other people to look at them. 2) I also want to 
make a couple of the avatars I have in my mind. The characters I've made that most specifically reflect what I want. My robot titan. My D&D characters. 3) It seems like there's some room to make minigames within the game. I feel like once I knew what was possible, I'd be fairly good at this.

175974997,"I think that is very good. One of the things I would like to say is, when you go in to see the psychiatrist you’ll go in as depressed. He’ll sit there for 15-30 minutes and won’t say anything. He’ll write you out a script for a pill, he may mumble “anti-depressant.” You’re fixing to waste 15 years of your life being miss-diagnosed, miss-medicated and miserable. It’s just a wild guess. During those 15-30 minutes of being silent, he could have said, “Do you ever have a racing mind?” He could have thought, “Well, if she’s depressed, she could be manic-depressed, so why don’t I ask her if she’s ever had a racing mind, a sign of mania?” I don’t why they don’t ask that. So, you might want to go in prepared. You might want to download the signs of bipolar, including the signs of mania. Check off the ones you have and read them off to him. OK. Just a little preparation there. Also, if you type into the search engine, “Do I have biopolar?” or something like that. You’
re looking for a site that can ask you 20 questions and if you answer 15 of them in a certain way it may indicate you have bipolar. Again, take the list to the psychiatrist, one for you and one for him. See what he thinks and if you think he’s completely off base you can get another doctor. I have a female psychiatrist so I seem to be better with that. Also, medicine has side affects, but I choose to take the medicine because it helps. Also, I think the medicine will help, but at times I have to remind myself that I have a major mental illness, bipolar. I don’t think about it a lot of time, but I still have difficulties. Be myself, I often don’t feel my mental illness. In a social situation, I can. So, what I’m saying is, there can still be difficult times ahead, but I think if we think positive, we will do better, and maybe even give ourselves credit for doing well a lot of the time even though we do have a major mental illness. I use the positive thinking many times a day. If a container of water sp
ills on the floor, I immediately start the positive thinking, get some rags and clean it up. I can use that process 10 times in an hour, 10 times a project, as I break each part of the project down into one positive step. You say, “I wish I could give my kids the sense that they are okay as they are. But I don’t believe about myself.” Well, if you feel positive about yourself, you’ll feel the same way about them and they’ll feel the same away about themselves. And you can tell them directly, “You did a really good job with that.” And “I appreciate your help.” Look for an excuse to praise them. If you raise them negative they will be negative. Set up rewards such as popcorn and movie night, or bikes in the park or down a nearby road or in a nearby neighborhood. Use your worry and your positive thinking to think up what might be enjoyable for them five minutes from now, a week from now. If a bike needs fixing for that, think about fixing it. Maybe an above ground pool for the summer. You say, 
My “thing” is constant scanning and diagnosing: what’s wrong, what’s broken, how can I fix it, what can I do, what improvements next, etc. I’m always looking for solutions but at the expense of being okay with things as they are.” I don’t think there’s anything wrong with wanting to make things better.

175975007,"Fortunately, cognitive therapies like CR and CBT are time-limited and results-oriented. Evaluating their success is more straight-forward than it is for many other forms of mental health treatment and support. How to Tell Cognitive Therapy is Working for You (or a Loved One) 1. You have learned new skills – A skill is observable, specific, and enduring. It is an ability that combines knowledge and behavior to do the things that make a difference in your life. Having a more positive attitude is not a skill. Using a Thought Record in CBT to evaluate and respond to automatic negative thoughts is. 2. You are making progress towards your long-term goals – Cognitive therapy for people with serious mental illness is most effective when it is linked to long-term goals for recovery such as finishing college or living independently. You can measure short-term progress by breaking these big recovery goals into smaller steps. Strengthening attention and working memory in CR can lead to improved prospects f
or success in college. 3. You can measure the results – It is the therapist’s responsibility to provide you a way to measure your progress. The computer-based drills of the Neuropsychological Educational Approach to Cognitive Remediation (NEAR) allow you to monitor weekly progress on those exercises. CR providers should also offer comprehensive testing that measures overall improvement in your thinking skills over the course of the entire program. In CBT, your therapist should help you set specific goals and a time frame for achieving them. Many CBT therapists assign homework at the end of sessions. Focusing on specific assignments, tasks, and exercises makes it easier for your therapist and you to measure the results. 4. Other people notice you are getting better – Cognitive therapy focuses on helping people achieve specific real-world goals. Once that happens people around you will start to notice and those who are closest to you will no doubt want to share their excitement at seeing the changes you h
ave made. 5. You look forward to the next session with enthusiasm – Cognitive therapy is not about hashing over old problems and feelings from the past. It’s about learning new skills and moving forward in your life. Chances are that if that’s happening in sessions you will feel good about them and want to return. This is the most important indicator of success: your own feeling that you are getting better. http://www.rtor.org/2016/10/18/cognitive-therapy-part-4 /"
175975008,My favorite kind. 70's music.
175975009,Ah great!!!
175975010,Most tests online aren’t accurate. If you want an accurate result learn the cognitive functions and temperaments.
175975011,Hope you have a great start to school _AT_MENTION_ psychotic
174368266,I know psychiatrists don’t want to believe the meds are harmful but I’ve only had one psychosis and my IQ dropped several years after that psychosis not due to the psychosis.. I therefore believe it’s due to the meds in my case.....there is even a study on people with my mutation that says working memory is reduced with APs.
175975012,I've been having baby fever like crazy! For like 6 months. Ugh.
175975013,Iced coffee
175975014,"It's crazy, I never know where im going to get inspiration from. I had a conversation with my niece, who've ive never talked to in my life, and discovered she's going to be a teacher, and she was a better student than me. So I started to map out an education post for her because im an education advocate my self. We can never have any idea where the next inspiration is going to come from. I'm dead for months and then this lands in my lap."
175975015,"Soaked in the tub, but only because I live at the South Pole."
175975016,so i looked at his most recent Facebook post. He basically said he wanted to die and be with his mom and it means he's going to be single for the rest of his life. Sounds over the top for someone i've only met a few days ago and heard about 2 weeks ago.
175975017,Looks like Walmart and target have a Cheesecake Factory sampler for V day......
175975018,Hm feeling uncertain myself Feeling like idk some kind of way about some news I got
175975019,Hope your Mom feels better soon and that her numbers go up.
175975020,Second day of respite. My voices are bad and not making much sense.
175975021,Where I live there's a lot of food banks we can go to. You being where you are idk. Here they tend to have somewhat good food and sometimes even stuff that is usually expensive. Don't hesitate if you need food you need food.
175975022,"I'm pretty much a failure and burden on my family, could have been so far in my life by now but here I am"
175975023,Yeah I could try that. I've never listened to an audiobook before
175975024,It's 2:45am and I can't sleep. So I took an Ativan because I have akathisia. The Exorcist is on. I'm hoping they didn't open my locked drawers. Everything went badly today.
175975025,"Hi, I hope you are feeling better today. I think 18 days may not be enough for your body to adapt to the medication. You may have to wait probably at least 2 more weeks to see how you are doing. I took zoloft for 6-8 months. The 1st month I had diarrhea every single day. I even dropped a few pounds. After that I started to gain weight and get weird muscle involuntary movements. I was able to sleep but had vivid dreams and sweats. I ended up stopping it because of the muscle issue."
175975026,"Best sleep in weeks last night, much needed. Woke up without any psychotic stuff so far, so, the Trilafon is working. Just an awful day yesterday. I rarely get these hallucinations/delusions of doom and gloom and hell and other awfulness. It is never good when you are a Christian and your sick brain tries to tell you your HP doesn't love you anymore. Oh well. Maybe today will be better. Hugs and love to all!!!"
175975027,Good for you!
175975028,Im sad I get so fucking sad
175975029,Oh! That's what you mean by outside access! _PERSON_ my complex doesnt have gates or anything. All apartments open to the outside. And we are on the first floor.
175975030,I feel your pain. I was referred over a month ago to a psychiatrist and still haven’t heard back from them. I’m in the middle of a manic episode and still can’t see the psychiatrist right away wtf. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
175975031,Have a headache and feel shaky. Maybe from tapering off the thorazine.
175975032,I like Jelly roll... my roommate introduced me to his music. Relatable... drown my pain in a bottle and _NAME_.
175975033,Yes definitely my first Psychosis is attributed to workplace stress.....
175975034,"Hey I’m actually struggling with a similar situation. I am in nursing school, but not living on campus. Definitely feeling anxious and depression creeping back up. It is important to focus on your studies because change is definitely hard to adjust, but to also incorporate into your day things that make you happy and clears your mind! I have been trying to write, listen to music, take a walk, etc! Hope you feel better soon ??"
175975035,"My pdoc took away the one sleep med that that had ever worked, Doxepin. I'm guessing she thought it might have made me go into a psychotic break. But in fact it was her suggestion to take my AP before bed, without food. That and I decreased the amount to 60mgs, which is pretty low. I'm still confused about all of that to be honest. I'm no longer panicking though. It's all in the past. I feel safe now."
175975036,I’ll get on more if u get on more bb (and get a membership. Only 25 dollars for a whole year or 3 dollars a month).
175975037,"This is why I bought those drugs. To escape. If anyone has any insight let me know. I'm ****_NAME_. I have no family. I want to talk about my thoughts and feelings but it seems like they're immoral and I get judged for talking about it with my ""family"". They don't admit to their own problems about what they've caused me. They just say I'm mentally ill and need help or to be admitted to the psych ward or I need my meds and blablabla"
175975038,"I didn't know that, I wonder if they'll do any of the LotR ones on Switch. I just have the remasted HP collection for my PS4. I've yet to play years 5-7."
175975039,No thank god.
175975040,Kinda worried about slumberkitty.......haven’t seen her in a while......
175975041,"That's great Cogladaid, we've been low here in upstate NY too. But they don't plan on reopening gyms for the foreseeable future which sucks cause I'd love to get a membership and start working out again. But at least I can walk a lot now that I have my water bottle so I don't get dehydrated"
175975042,Hugs bpcyclist.......I got a solid four hours so far but even broken sleep is a bad sign for me.....
175975043,It sounds like you DO have the energy to fight. Don't give up. Share your story here and you will find compassion and friends.
175975044,I am good now. Realized my mental health professionals were trying to convince me of some stupid stuff. I now am going to stop doubting school so much.
175975045,Just FYI you can’t say no to work while on unemployment you have to take whatever you’re offered. My dad routinely used unemployment between work because he was a millwright and work was spotty.
175975046,More rain coming....I prefer the rain in the city...it seems less dangerous....
175975047,Is it possible you're moods effect your sleep pattern or is there a reason your therapist think your sleep patterns is causing the moods?
175975048,I did DBT therapy and I still use a lot of skills. Things are just incredibly hard right now. It's been 8 weeks since my kids and I were returned home and my husband had to stay. Luckily my psychiatrist just started doing zoom appointments though she can't prescribe or adjust my meds because we are in different countries but talking to her helps.
175975049,"I know you are B.... ...and the same for you. Thanks so much for the kind words my friend, _PERSON_."

175975057,"Thank you for taking the time to read my post and for your comment. I will make an appointment to a psychiatrist I think . I had been using ear plugs, but they were kind of ineffective, making the noise just a little more faint. I actually think this is worse, because it made me uncertain at times if I am hearing the noise or not. I spoke with a doctor and am getting my ears checked, she also recommended a change in room would be best, but she cant really help me ""not concentrate"". She also agreed a fainter noise would be worse, and told me since I already anticipate a noise, even better ear wear might not really help me at this point. I am sleeping pretty well now, and definitely feel a little better. My problem now is that when I am alone, and it is very quiet (a lot of the time), Im having these obsessive thoughts continue, is the sound there? . Ugh, everything was normal just a few weeks ago. Until then, I will just take it one day at a time I guess. I am getting anxious because I cant just g

175975076,Have you tried DBSA or _USER_ID_ online support groups? I can relate.
175975077,"I can totally relate, especially to the multiple factors! My recent move was a huge trigger along with being a care giver to an I’ll parent and my own health issues. It’s not easy when you mix multiple changes. I found fitting in time for a walk/nature time even just a few minutes helped. Reach out for help whether it is for the emotional support or the physical help moving. Make sure to get enough sleep. I found listening to relaxing apps ( some audio books would probably work too) right before going to bed will help me end the day better and gives me something to look forward I as relief when I’m having a bad day. Good luck with the move and let us know how it goes. We’re here if you need to talk!"
175975078,Going to have dinner with my friend later
175975079,"I realized I felt alone last night without my mom and sister in the house. It was a strange feeling because I've never really felt alone before - Not even as a kid, sitting alone in the playground. I just felt alone in the world where no one understood the true meaning to life and just played games, took everything about school seriously, brainwashed - Memorizing information. Maybe I'm just asexual cuz of trauma and need to wait for myself to get better idk.. But I still like being alone.. I just want people and friends to talk to and to connect with people.. I've become way more social after my psychedelic trips because it changed my personality to being more open to possibilities and wonder about life - Something that every psychiatric medication failed to do for me."

175975083,THen don't bother with them. We don't get to choose our family. I do not talk to any of my family and I am perfectly ok with it. If they were in my life it would be fake and full of drama. My life is peaceful and I get to help people and give my time to those that need and want it. All that matters is that you take care of yourself and love yourself. you will never find the happiness you search for in another human being. Humans are disappointing. Look within yourself and you will find what you need.

175975086,"I've never joined a blog or online group before so this is new for me. I'm a 16 year-old girl and from August 2019 to March 2020 I was addicted to coke. I started using drugs to escape nightmares that I was frequently having of my ex boyfriend, who was sexually abusive. I got fired from my job and arrested for stealing because of my addiction. I stopped having nightmares and I still kept using. COVID-19 is probably what made me stop because I didn't have ability to use anymore. I never went through withdrawals and never felt like I wanted it until last week. I snuck out of my parents house and ending up getting caught. It didn't end too badly so I snuck out again two nights ago. My dad took away my phone and won't let me contact my mom or any friends,which sent me into a short depressive episode. I feel like I got off topic, but all I want to ask is how do I stop? I keep indulging in self destructive behavior and doing coke when I know it will affect me negatively. I want to stop but when the momen
t comes I always find myself saying yes, even if I've been clean for weeks. I do think it has to do with something going on in my head, but I haven't been diagnosed with any illnesses because my parents never really thought there was something wrong. I have symptoms of PTSD and anxiety a lot, as well and BPD but since I haven't being diagnosed by anything other than an online screening I'm hesitant to ask for help. Overall, I realized I can't do it on my own anymore and I'm looking for some way to help myself get better."
175975087,When I was in college it was ridiculous. The AC was basically freezing when on a lot of the time but when off the room was roasting. No in between. Plus sitting under the AC was either a god send or involved being wrapped up in a coat lol.

175975093,"Ok first off you should not be ashamed, scared, embarrassed, or anything about telling anyone close to you. There is nothing wrong with you nor is what happening to you your fault or something you can control. I’m telling you once you even tell one person close to you it will take a huge weight off your shoulders. I used to be so ashamed to tell anyone I suffered from mental illness and now I don’t care I tell who ever and I found out so many people are on the same boat as me and I had no clue!! We share tips to help each other out and I don’t have to hide the way I feel. I have debilitating panic attacks I wouldn’t wish them on my worst enemy. Even if you are in 100% perfect health during this pandemic no one can say this hasn’t messed with their head even alittle bit. This is so messed up and it won’t freakin end! It’s beyond stressful for everyone so it’s so normal to feel panic. Please seek some help don’t ignore this it’s a very real thing and you need to get a hold of it. 
There is nothing wrong with you!!! It’s life just becoming to much and sometimes we need to to step back and say ok I need help and there is nothing wrong with that. Good luck."

175975096,"I think you ought to be given a medal for what you say you are going though. It’s good you are communicating with your therapist. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist to see what they may think? You list a number of negatives, but there are some positives. One is that you are reaching out for help, and you’re not having to leave your house as far as this website is concerned. You have to be very smart and level thinking to do that. Another positive is that you have a physical structure for you and your kids to live in and at no monetary cost. You have air conditioning , TV, stove, fridge, lights, furniture, roof over your head, floor, you are protected from the wind and the rain and the heat, and in the winter you will be protected from the cold. You are looking at every negative that you can find, and you are finding it. Your worst condition may be your attitude. I’ve had it myself, so I know that what that’s like. I know what it’s like to be your own worst enemy, for decades, I know that. 
You could be in a much worse situation. _PERSON_ says, “Do all you can to reduce your anxiety through self help we have some good links in our resources section so take a look and keep us posted we are here to help support you.” Those resources are located at the opening page of this forum, at the top of the list of people writing in with problems, titled “Anxiety-Panic Resources.” You can click on that. One of the suggestions is being positive. We can go to all the therapists we want, but if we aren’t positive, we’re still tripping ourselves up. Your description of being in the same room as a football game on TV is comical. You say, “When he watches football on tv, my anxiety is through the roof, I’m not sure what it is but I absolutely detest the noise and commentary, not sure what that’s about. I cannot even be in the same house, I have to leave when it’s on.” Is that why there’s no women in the room when a game is on? Your other descriptions are also that: “Basically, I can’t s
tand living at someone else’s place, it’s his not mine, I’ve always had my own place but I’m finding things really stressful and makes me physically sick like how the interior is, how things are placed in the kitchen. The carpet has made me feel ill because it’s old. I feel like I have no sense of control or order because it’s not how I would have things. The way he had his couch was so stressful and one day he changed it and I felt soooo much better."" You write like _PERSON_. His opening to The Catcher in the Rye is: “If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that _NAME_ kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything personal about them.” And, ""Anyway, I 
keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody’s around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That’s all I do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it’s crazy, but that’s the only thing I’d really like to be."" And, . “It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.” And, “That’s the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if they’re not much to look at, or even if they’re sort of stupid, you fall in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They drive you crazy. 
They really can.” “If a girl looks swell when she meets you, who gives a darn if she’s late?” “Every time you mention some guy that’s strictly a ******—very mean, or very conceited and all—and when you mention it to the girl, she’ll tell you he has an inferiority complex. Maybe he has, but that still doesn’t keep him from being a ******, in my opinion.” That’s what you sound like when you talk. It’s funny. But there's no joke. It's just that it sounds funny. You asked, “Will I ever be capable of living with someone? Is it just because me and him are so different or is it ocd. I need things in order to feel good and relaxed and it’s just out of control at someone else’s place to the point it brings me to tears and makes me feel sick."" _NAME_ wrote in Eat, Pray, Love: Favorite quote: ""People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings 
you to your own attention so you can change your life."""

175975116,"meds: geodon 120mg for delusions triliptal 1800mgs the psychiatrist *thinks* i have bipolar symptoms which I don't! I had one manic switch years ago and that was it. But she keeps forcing these pills down my throat but if it helped it would help me sleep. It does absolutely nothing. Remeron 30mgs for sleep. WIll start tapering off it soon. Restoril 30mgs for sleep. Will be switching to Ativan Men's Multivitamina Vermson 1 pill with dinner Triple strength fish oill 2 with dinner Fiber supplment twice a day. I've tried Sarcosine and it did absolutely nothing. I'm guessing your talking about its afects for anhedonia? It did nothing. It's not just that I have anhedonia, it's that I have a lack of feeling anything. I'm beyond frustrated with my life."

175975118,I’m having some psychosis. I’m trying really hard for it to not come thru. Like utilizing distraction and whatnot. But I’m shaking physically and having an anxiety attack. I still don’t have my meds and they have texted me (my pharmacy) that my meds will be delayed.

175975120,"My mind is on the fact that I need to get my $#%^ together, so I'm hoping to have the ability to step away from here again. This site can be like a compulsion for me. Also on my mind, is that I've gotten a lot of what I've said instantly shut-down lately (elsewhere) - with people going straight to throwing in insults about feminism as if it's going to upset me. I've found the moment I can clarify that I'm not a feminist, it ""disarms"" them and we can have rational, often even research-based conversations (even if we don't necessarily see eye to eye by the end of it). A lot of what I've been saying for many years, is getting automatically clumped in with feminist sjws. I need to find a new approach. I'm not very good at diplomacy or people skills or how to stay calm instead of losing my $#%^. I need to learn to behave calmly in manner that makes me hear the core issues people have with things and gets people to think instead of jumping down their throats.

175975127,"_USER_ID_- thank you so much for your reply. I’m so sorry to hear that life has been such a struggle for you. Your positivity in the face of that struggle is inspiring. I like the advice your counselor gave you and I will try it. There are good days and bad ,as you well know. I have a counselor but she is so busy these days that she’s only available once a month. Think I need a little more than that right now. I am trying to find one that is in my plan. I take Zoloft but have only been on it at a therapeutic dose, for a month- probably not long enough to see a real difference. Was on Paxil for a previous episode but it didn’t seem to work this time. I take Remeron and _PERSON_ to sleep. My mom also died in the year 1997, in July. So sorry for your loss. Being mismanaged is frustrating,but glad that now you seem to be on the right path. I appreciate your input. I will take one day at a time.- you as well. Btw - where was that Integrated therapy program based on Existentialism ? Must have been 
interesting. God bless you, also"

But if you are thinking of staying for your children, I can say that's a bad idea. I had parents that fought all the time, and that never benefits the kids. I hope things work out for you."

175975137,Going to the nutrition class here in an hour
175975138,I've put myself under so much stress.. What do I do? Should I read and ignore the world? I think I should do that
175975139,"Hi I'm new to this forum! So I'll just give you all some background information about when I got my panic disorder. I'm an English citizen that was at the time living in Australia. I was working a double shifts as an English Teacher at a language school doing day and night classes (14 hour working days) The job was both demanding and stressful. I've always been the kind of person that gets stressed very easily, particularly at work, but I've always managed it and it has never been chronic , debilitating or unhealthy. For example, I would have a bad day at work and go home stressed then the next day I'd be fine and back to my normal self. It was around March 20th when I experienced Panic Disorder. My work contract had finished and I'd planned to go up to the North of Australia for a holiday then travel around Asia and Dubai before coming home back home to the UK. I had paid for all of this trip already. It was the 23rd March (the day before I was set to leave for North Australia) that the Australian 
government decided to shut all the borders due to Covid. This meant that we were trapped where we were. The authorities told us that it was time for any expats to go home as it was no longer safe so we tried to book a 2000 dollar flight home and it was cancelled due to the Singapore borders being closed too. We were no longer welcome in Australia but we could not get home either and we couldn't get the money back that we had spent on these flights.This meant that we were trapped in our tiny apartment in Sydney with a significant amount of our savings lost. I'd felt upset and stressed about the situation but it wasn't anything unhealthy. I'd gone from working 14 hour days to spending all day in a flat during lockdown on my own with nothing to do. So one night I felt pretty relaxed. I sat watching a film that I was pretty into when all of a sudden it felt like a big lightning bolt had struck me. I felt this intense feeling of fear and panic that had came out of nowhere for no reason. I had to leave the room as 
I thought I was going crazy. I couldn't breathe, I felt like I didn't know who I was or where I was anymore, I can remember looking at my hands and they just didnt feel like mine. It was like a million voices screaming in my head and I tried to count through it but my mind just felt as if it was depleting and there was nothing I could do about it which was making me feel even more anxious as I was losing control. After coming in and out of this hell for hours into the night and contemlating A and E at times, I eventually fell asleep. I'd realised at this point that it was a panic attack. Sadly, I was hoping I'd wake up in the morning and the feeling would be gone but I still felt the same. I wasn't having a panic attack anymore but I can remember crying my eyes out because it felt like I wasn't me anymore and I thought I was going crazy. I felt constant crippling fear and derealization/ depersonalisation all the time. I didn't recognise myself anymore even though I could mimic the old me to other people, but 
the reality was that inside i just felt like an imposter in my own brain and I craved the old me, I had taken for granted who I was and how happy and healthy i was before; I had began to feel like i would never feel normal again. The feeling was so unfamiliar to me that I didn't know if it was anxiety or whether i was really going insane. I found every time I would try to do something nice to escape this feeling it would ruin my experiences by tainting me with fear and panic so I just couldn't live a normal life anymore. I couldn't eat solid food, I vomited most mornings and lost a lot of weight. I was sure I was going to starve to death. I remember thinking that the old me would have loved losing all this weight, I would be in the mirror trying all my clothes on to see how loose they were and planning my next night out,(when lockdown was over) but I was too scared to look in the mirrors anymore because the depersonalisation was so bad that I didn't recognise the person looking back. I started to get intrusiv
e thoughts. Imagine if you went crazy and they had to lock you away because you were so out of control- i would think, sometimes they would be disturbing and I couldn't watch anything particularly heavy on TV anymore, because I was worried about what weird thoughts my torturous brain would throw at me. I remember having a panic attack one day because I couldn't find my shopping bag which I was adamant I'd left in the kitchen, it made me feel like I was going insane and this triggered the attack, a normal person would have just realized I'd forgot I'd put it in the bedroom but because i felt so unstable I was thinking all kinds of weird things. My friend said I'd made her laugh once for dancing around the bedroom, I couldn't remember this memory so i was adamant that I was losing my mind and had another panic attack- funnily enough the memory actually came back to me later that day. Because of the derealisation I had a real sense that I was in some hyper-real world and those around me wern't real and this conv
inced me even more that I was losing the plot- so of course- I had more panic attacks. It was so irrational that sometimes when I was on the edge of a panic attack, experiencing this impending doom, I felt petrified and overwhelmed by absolutely everything, even hearing certain music, or smelling something deep fried, or seeing somebody in a facemask was all too much and I felt absolutely terrified. It was at night that things got even more scary. I used to get sleep starts and sleep tremors so bad that I would stay awake all night sometimes. I'd feel exhausted but when I tried to sleep my knee would jerk me back awake like an electric shock. Sometimes I would get woken up by nocturnal panic attacks and I swear it felt like I was hallucinating sometimes. My hands would be cold, sweaty and numb and I couldn't breathe. I still get restless leg syndrome, the overwhelming urge to move and kick your legs so much that you have to get up and move around. I would have terrible diarrea, sickness and excessive urinatio
n that I stopped wanting to drink liquid at times. While my symptoms are common to most people with panic disorder there are a few things that are slightly different. For example, most people with panic disorder feel a fear of going out in public places or going to events with lots of people because they feel trapped, I was the opposite. Whilst my panic attacks could come at any time for absolutely no reason. The thing I feared most was going to bed at night. Trapped in the dark with my own brain that had turned evil on me for some reason was the scariest thing. In terms of me getting myself out and about I actually enjoyed this because it would distract me from my intrusive thoughts and kept me busy. Most people say that they only feel safe in their beds but I'd do anything not to have to spend time in bed, alone, with my just my thoughts. I'd get up at the crack of dawn, throw up and then do anything to keep myself busy- one time I even wrote an english essay just to keep my mind occupied for a few hours. T
his was challenging especially during a lock down. It annoys me when people say that if you can go about your normal life then you don't have panic disorder because I went about my normal life but I suffered horrendous panic disorder in my brain and no one knew. i figured that even though I was having a mental crisis I would not stop living my life and I would always be a yes man and I actually think this helped me a lot. I remember being on a run one day, I had been experiencing severe anxiety every day for almost 3 weeks at this point, I was thinking, I am living in fear of fear. This is going to kill me. One of my good friends had committed suicide in January and I was starting to think that while I didn't feel depressed I will eventually become exhausted and maybe even suicidal (this was something I used to fear alongside going insane) and I need to get help because I wasn't getting any better and I was starting to think i had conditioned my brain to think like this forever. I needed to get it rewired bac
k to how it was before. Every night i'd go to sleep and think, please can I wake up feeling better tomorrow? And every morning I'd wake up with that nauseous feeling of debilitating anxiety. I'd started to realise that if i was ever going to get better this wouldn't disappear overnight, it would take time and professional help. The only thing I had on my side was that I didn't have depression but the anxiety and panic was so potent soon depression would follow if i didn't seek help. So that's exactly what I did. I will tell you more about this in my next post! But please share if you had any similar experiences, or if there is anything here that you felt too, or even any advice you may have! Thank you so much for reading!"

175975145,Thanks. I’m hoping this depression will go away soon. I recently switched back to my old dr though because my new pushed ECT only and it hasn’t been helping even after 7 treatments. My old dr saw me today but he still maintains I have bipolar with psychotic features while my psychologist says sza. It’s whatever. I just want stability and this dr has helped me find it in the past.

Otherwise it means nothing. I would talk to her calmly about living arrangements. How do you manage to stay in your vehicle over night without her getting upset? It is totally up to you what you do with your life. But you do have choices and options. You can walk away from the situation and never feel guilty because you have done more than try. You've given it your all and then some. Never feel like you failed her. It's too bad the treatment isn't better. She needs to have some one on one therapy. And I believe an antidepressant. I imagine she probably isn't consistent taking her meds. If she was, she probably wouldn't have the outbursts. I have had a temper all of my life. And I usually ended up hurting myself more than anything. But it can be controlled, though it is work and practice. There are ways she could be helped. T

175975178,"Thank you. This is very helpful. I’m absolutely open to medicine, but I’ve had a hard time getting my doc to agree because of liver enzymes, desire to see if treating thyroid improves the mental/emotional symptoms, and general reluctance to believe that I’m “bad enough” to need help. I can behave functionally because of all my rehearsal pushing through extreme discomfort, but I’m not ok. Like, I gave unmedicated birth without showing unease. You have helped me see: I can schedule an appointment with someone else. My community is in desperate need for psychiatrists, and the wait is very long. Same for primary care physicians. There’s a town a couple hours away that might be worth the drive. It’s hard with kids though. I can figure something out. What you’re saying about positivity is true... I really try to stay positive and I’m currently trying to learn DNRS to try to retrain my brain to be less “activated”. My “thing” is constant scanning and diagnosing: what’s wrong, 
what’s broken, how can I fix it, what can I do, what improvements next, etc. I’m always looking for solutions but at the expense of being okay with things as they are. I wish I could give my kids the sense that they are okay as they are. But I don’t believe about myself. I’ll call for a psychiatrist now."
175975179,"I want to start by saying that I am a 24 year old white male who weighs 180 pounds and I do recognize that I have anxiety, but I feel like something else is going on with me. I’ve had 3 different doctors tell me that they believe that all I’m having is anxiety. For the last 4 years I get random chest pains in the center and left side of my chest. I can feel my pulse in my hands sometimes even when my heart rate is in the 60’s and 70’s. I yawn a lot sometimes which also scares me. And some days when I wake up I just feel like I can’t do anything without feeling like I’m weak and out of breath. I always watch my heart rate and it never jumps up real high randomly (which is what my doctor said is real bad.) The chest pains come randomly though, I can’t seem to find a pattern with them. Even when I don’t feel anxious at all my chest can still hurt off and on all day. I also want to say that on one occasion at the ER the doctor thought I had GERD. Well whenever I first had them I thought 
I was dying so I went to the ER and they did a EKG and bloodwork and said I had a panic attack then proceeded to send me home. A couple of months go by and nothing changes so I decide to go see my doctor. I tell him my symptoms and he listens to my heart then proceeds to say “You have the strongest heart I’ve ever heard, your chances of a heart attack are basement level.” So he prescribes me Prozac and Buspirone. I’ll be honest and say that I didn’t take the medicine like I was supposed to and things never really changed for me. So a couple of years after that I decide to change my doctor and get a different opinion on things. I visit my new doctor and he immediately makes me do a EKG, X-ray of my chest, and blood work. A couple of days later he says everything looks good but your vitamin D is just a tad bit low so that is probably what is making your chest hurt. So I leave there and start taking vitamin D pills but again nothing is really helping. Again after a couple of months I went to the ER in 
fear that something was wrong with my heart. That day, like most days I just “feel off” or like I’m going to just fall out and my chest begins the sharp pains. So I enter the triage shaking and they did a EKG and more bloodwork. They came to the conclusion that my heart and blood looked good and they thought I had (Costochondritis) which is pretty much just inflamed bones in your chest. Even after all of these people telling me they don’t think anything is wrong with my heart I still don’t believe them so I go find a new doctor. I went and seen him this Thursday and described most of my symptoms to him. He listened to my heart then proceeded to do a EKG and bloodwork on me. When the EKG test came back he told me that I have Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia which is harmless and he assured me that nothing was wrong with my heart. He says that I have generalized anxiety disorder. I still feel like the only way I can rule out my heart is by seeing a cardiologist. Everyone around me says I’m being irratio
nal and that I’m totally fine. Please if anyone has been through this or has any advice it would be greatly appreciated!"

175975205,"I’m really sorry your getting picked on like that, just remember that the majority of peoples actions have more to do with them then they do with you. Hurt people hurt people. It’s not normal to pick on someone you live with just because they have a phobia. This person is most likely damaged themselves and there taking out on you, and they prob don’t even realize it. I know that doesn’t make it any better but you need to have the knowledge that there’s something wrong with your roommate, not with you."
175975206,Also it just makes me angry when my parents (especially my dad) think that all therapy is is fun and games.

175975208,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_, it's very exhaustive. Yes, I know _NAME_, I looked two interviews on YouTube. In the first one she still hadn't a “treatment”, the second one was made during the cure. She is actually very different, she seems more present during the therapy, on the opposite seems to be “away” in the previous interview, while describing her behaviour. But I noticed it 'through comparison, otherwise I wouldn't. I thought that she was a nice child in both, and sincere, probably because she is a child... idk. I listened to another interview too, where she is adult and explaining her job. She is even too much “perfect” and I was doubtful to be honest, instinctively I can't trust her. But I do not trust a lot of people, than I guess it doesn't mean anything. About her therapist, it was perhaps a mischance, I hope so. I can't know. However, sometimes this kind of children (likely inmates) attract sadistic people. If you have aggressive tendencies, it's a good excuse to look for people 
in a vulnerable position (under your power), and that “deserve” your “punishment”, so that you can act your pulses with a “good” excuse. Let's hope it's a different situation. Btw these treatments should be monitored very carefully. For psychopathy, I think that we haven't data enough. Unless I missed some point, all we have is some adults having a different brain scan. It's not enough to be automatically sure that psychopathy is inborn. I am not excluding anything, but other interpretations are possible too, for example a different development due to various factors, or an epigenetic origin, instead of the genetic one. In practice, we can't know if it's an organic or functional problem. There is an interesting article published online by Cambridge University Press: ""Born this way? A review of neurobiological and environmental evidence for the etiology of psychopathy"" by _NAME_, _NAME_ A_PERSON_ and _NAME_. It's a bit specialised, but very interesting."

175975248,I'm bored at work today. There's nothing to do. There is one thing I can do but it's not due until like 2021. Not kidding. I can scan three more folders into the database. I scanned two this morning. I only have three left. I feel bad sometimes that I get paid to do nothing. But I'm here if someone needs me. Obviously sometimes I'm busy. But sometimes I'm not. It's never a good sign if I am on PC in the morning during the week because that means work has nothing going on.

175975250,"When I had chest pains from a long term (10 years or more) bad marriage, I was very concerned about that. I went to heart doctors, took tests, and they would say no heart problem. But they wouldn't say what it was. When the marriage ended, the chest pain ended. That was what was causing my chest pain. The tension, constricting of the blood vessels around my heart, reducing the blood flow until it caused chest pain, is my guess. So, I was always very concerned about the chest pain. You say, ""To me this also sound like anxiety or panic attCk symptoms. So because I have chest pains and no other symptom than I should be ok ?"" I think you can feel OK that it's not a heart problem but a chest pain problem (but I would still keep going to the doctor if I had it), from maybe anxiety. Again, when did this chest pain start? Are you in a stressful situation?"

I was asking because I'm still wondering what to do with them; when you have lots of contact its probably easier to argue for cutting them out of your life - like if youre confronted with their crap regularly. I remember confronting my mom for example when I was 16 about her being all ""mhm, aha, mhm"" when I am talking which made me feel like she didnt listen, which made her really angry, which nowadays I see as apparently having been correct in my assumption. Nowadays I barely talk with her at all really, only about really shallow stuff on the occasions when she calls or on christmas etc. Its more like having contact to some annoying coworkers though I think heh."

175975257,He GG. Thanks for the update. I’m in pretty much the same position as you. The only thing that I found really works for me is benzodiazepines. But I will not take those other than on a very rare occasion because of the risk of dependency. I’m going to try inositol— a Vitamin like substance that has apparently worked for some people. We’ll see if that does any good. But I am not willing to tolerate any more of the wild guessing that psychiatry has to offer.
175975258,"I sometimes question whether my faith was real or if it was just the result of mania. Because I always felt like I was connected to god and felt an amazing euphoria whenever I prayed, just like I feel when manic.

After my mood stabilizer was increased a couple years ago I stopped feeling the euphoria and as a result prayed less then eventually stopped that and church altogether"

It's promising because it's related to transportation work a bit. It's a goods store where I'd have to move things around, stock shelves, and unload trucks. I'm going to read about the company and piece together its demography, history, and needs. I feel one of my strengths is reading information to understand situations. My resume will probably also be another strength, as it's a chance for me to verbally express myself. The interview and social environment will be weaknesses."

It's insane how far we've come with treating heart ailments like that. What used to require open heart surgery is now a borderline outpatient procedure. So as someone who has had a loved one go through that, I can tell you that it really is simple, and my dad was in his 70s when he had both of his procedures. I hope that gives you a bit of reassurance =) Deep breathing and I have a hard time getting along. Every time I start to have an anxiety attack due to skipped beats I will start to deep breathe and that feels like it brings on a flutter or a hard thud LOL. So it's like the cure is worse than the condition (which is hilarious considering that beta blockers appear to have gotten me into this situation!) I am a bit calmer this afternoon than I was 24 hours ago. Still having some palpitations, but much softer and less noticeable than yesterday
. That has helped me to relax. I still have that feeling of dreariness and defeat attached to it though. I think just getting the cardiologist on the phone Monday morning will help ease me some more. In the meantime, I'm kind of reluctant to do anything even somewhat physical in case it sets off another run of them.

174368622,I'm sleeping about 12 hours a night with Zyprexa. Geodon was the same for me. But honestly it's worth it for me because it actually works and I'm not having positive symptoms. I'd be much more angry if it wasn't working lol.

Due to the past 10 years (really the past 5) on my phone all day. Man... there’s a huge hump behind my neck where my spine has reshaped itself to accommodate my head being down all the time. Which affects the Chiari 1. Which is my cerebellum having grown into my spinal cord entryway. Apparently it’s genetic. And then the bottom of my spine, where my back end is, is where I have a compacted disc. So I’m in pain all the time. I have to lay down multiple times a day. Like every 20-25 min in order to rest my back. I need to goto a spinal doctor is what i need."

175975305,"Hello Sunflower Of all the illnesses in the world I, believe depression is close to the worst! I have been there, and I never want to go back. It was many years ago, but I remember it well. It is interesting to read your post and to see that you recognize exactly how you got to this point. Are you aware that you know ""why""? You say ""I have had depression since at least high school, but I always hid it and kept it inside. I don't talk about my feelings or my emotions. I bottle everything up"". There is your answer Sunflower. The reason we humans do that is because we have this dumb idea that if we were to talk about our feelings that ""no one would understand, because other people DONOT FEEL THE SAME WAY!"" And that is so wrong! Our feelings are no different than other people's feelings....we are not weird or different or crazy! And what's more, if we share how we feel, it is extremely good for us, AND....it is even good for the other person. Our feelings need to come out and to see the light of 
day...not be hidden away in a dark corner, where they can become sick and give us more emotional pain. If it is possible for you to go for counselling...do it, but if that is not possible, look at Inspire as a good place to come and chat....right here on your thread, and talk about the things which bother you, and first thing you will know....YOU ARE NOT ALONE!"

I can’t wait till I’m back in college in the fall. I feel like that provided a lot of stability for me. These past 2 years have just been weird and not my best.

175975313,"That’s great your np is working with you....I mean if you’re taking it at night and then still sleeping in late that’s a problem. You’ve gotta be able to live better on the med than off. Maybe you could learn techniques for voices, moods and delusions if they’re just minor? As far as ac, you can limit it to the bedroom or turn it up to 78 or so. I keep mine at 78 and it’s like half the price I’d pay for 72. 78 is 78 anywhere and my AP makes me hot too. I’m just giving examples I’ve seen my sister use, for example they didn’t use heat except a space heater in winter and it’s way cold here.

Although I can't say that I like going to my annual doctor's appointment, I don't get nervous about it, to speak of, because they've never found anything seriously wrong with me. I'm less likely to worry about something if that something has never happened to me before. Good luck with your doctor's visit next week, _PERSON_! I hope all goes well for you."
175975324,Is your pdoc changing things at your request though or just randomly? If it’s at your request then that’s a responsive pdoc and often a good thing. Meds definitely aren’t the only thing...I know that I use a variety of cbt techniques including self care and even a small amount of retail therapy.
175975325,Hopefully the beta blocker helps. Maybe you need some sleep? Hope the seroquel helps with that. Plus the CBD.
175975326,"_PERSON_, I am so sorry. I know this was not the answer that you wanted to hear...and you are right, the not knowing prolongs the process that you are going through. It's not right.

I also try meeting new people here at my school but im ALWAYS the one texting first or making the first interaction. I feel like the kind of person that no one would ever think of when they want to hang out with or be around someone.

175975346,I just asked my mom for this for my birthday. I’ve wanted an octopus plushie for 3 years now.
175975347,"My family...idk. I’m sick of asking my sister to call him to check on him. My mom says my sister is a very busy person. I cringe now when people say they are “busy”. Unless they really are. I’ve been told by people that they are busy for their reasoning about why they haven’t called or texted in weeks or months. I just don’t believe some people to be that busy that they can’t call or text someone for 15 min or less. I hate to say this but I don’t believe my sister in that way. I rarely hear from her. Maybe a couple times a month. I text her and all she replies with is a thumbs up or a heart usually. My mom says she’s a very busy person with her business and child. Someone isn’t that busy tho that they can’t make a phone call at least every 2 weeks, especially to their parent. Especially if their parent isn’t doing well. I’m the only one of my dads kids that call him everyday. Never been one to talk bad about my sister but this irks me. Rubs me the wrong way. It’s all abo
ut priorities. And if my sis can get on a plane to go visit her husbands family for a week every month, she surely can call her dad for 15 min every couple weeks at the least. Even my mom has been mad at her for not calling her. It’s priorities and hers is not with her own family. My mom can’t accept that. I can for the most part. I haven’t called my mom in like 5 days. That’s for other reasons. All my sis has been doing is sending him obscure vitamins. Which he’s not interested in but won’t say it. Just sending vitamins every once and awhile isn’t gonna cut it. *Sorry this is so long. There’s specific things I never talk about here or with anyone, but for the reason that i feel it isn’t important but subconsciously i know it is. For me, at least.* Even when I was working and doing all the stuff I was before March, I made it a priority to keep in touch with my parents. It’s about priorities."

175975351,"That is odd. Wellbutrin gave me panic attacks for 4 years even after I stopped taking it. It also didn't allow me to stay asleep. It was a terrible med for me. It can *definitely* cause anxiety, BB. That might be it! It's an upper drug but without being so physically addictive. When i was on 150mgs I coulnd't sleep but it didnt' work either, so he upped it to 300 and bam, met with continual panic attacks even after i stopped the med so I got on benzos, and then an SSRI but the SSRI's might not stop the panic attacks it wellbutrin is still flowing.

175975389,"Let's just say I have grandchildren. Which is how I spend much of my time, writing family history and putting together photo albums for my grandchildren, for my grand nieces and nephews. Yeah, there ain't much going on this time around. I have ""Oh, my gosh!!"" reactions to things to. I panic and my thinking slows down. Just the other day, I had a health food pill I needed to take, but I only have 3 mg. tablets, and I needed 1 mg. and I was out of the 1 mg. My first reaction was to panic. It was a sleep aid tablet and I didn't want to take more than I needed. Then my positive thinking kicked in and actually overrode the panic, and I said, ""Cut the 3 mg. pill in half, and just pick out the pieces that look to total 1 mg."" And I did. And the next night I did the same thing. Then the next day, the neighbor who had been saying the 1 mg. sleep aid pills would be at his back door by delivery, came and said, ""Oh, those pills were delivered to my mailbox, not the back door as I said on the phone a coupl
e of times. "" So, I was very proud that I had not panicked but that, again, that my positive thinking had gotten through my confusion and concern, and turned a panic situation into a solution. That I had solved the problem on my own, using the brain that I have, by switching it to positive by saying, ""Think positive"" before going into the problem. I never thought of myself as a panic person until you wrote that about your family. That's the first time I've even thought of that. I just thought, my adrenalin gets to going to fast, I can't think. But again, my positive thinking l slipped through that and solved the problem. A time when it didn't slip through, I don't drive much and took a daring adventure with my dog to a nearby neighborhood. Like going to the moon for me, all the way to the next neighborhood. And driving. My dog and I took a walk around the block and I can't find the keys to the car. I freaked, and I just a few minutes ago realized this is the panic like you said you family did. I went knock
ing on doors in the dark of complete strangers asking them to take me home to the next neighborhood (with a busy 4-lane in between and I couldn't cross it). One did, I got in my kitchen, calmed down, looked in my top shirt pocket, not my pants pocket, and there were my keys. There was no problem, I just panicked.

Interestingly, my schizoid friend and reading schizoid forums have introduced me to a new way of relating to my inner being, and I almost never feel that emptiness any more. The better I get to know my friend--and he has revealed an enormous amount about himself--the more I realize the way I feel is not and has never been even close to ""normal"". Yet that the way I am is perfectly fine, valid, and can be explored and swum around in like a coral reef. Honestly, I thought most of that article was 
excellent. The only parts I didn't care for were the obligatory, ""It's OK, you're not a freak."", boilerplate. Every psych author must worry that if they don't put that stuff in there, someone's gonna off themselves. However, there's only so many ways in which generic sympathy can be expressed and all have been sat on to the point the foam's lost its bounce. People with enduring psychological problems are WAY beyond the reach of banalities, but that's what teenagers are for--to eat up trends and to accept the banal as profound. It's on them to keep the psych industry afloat. This part surprised me: as it's my situation in a nutshell and I've never before seen it spelled out so bluntly by a professional. IF they have any concrete observations at all, I've found they usually beat around the bush. That specific ""reason"" for parental resentment™ is probably FAR more common than references to it would indicate. Many people never figure out who they are, what they love, or why they are alive. For such ""people
"", the birth of an unwanted child is actually a godsend, providing the perfect lightning rod for the self-loathing they clearly would have felt had they remained child-free. When you're child-free, you're in the chair under the hot lamp 24/365, and that's exactly how long it's gonna take to figure out what you need to do and to get it done."

Also, once you rule out any physical cause...you can talk about a management plan to help you start to feel your best again. Most people find that medication and or therapy...or the combination of both is the way to find relief and recovery/management of the issue.

175975430,"Wouldn't empathy be an expression of positive emotions? It may be born of negative ones, but to express it, you need to holster the positive ones. I'm thinking a schizoid's desk would have an overflowing in box and a practically empty out box. Or maybe it's the other way around, only the out box has a padlock on it and there are only a few isolated moments in the day when he remembers the combination. Well, we were in a relationship for almost five years. From when we were seventeen 'till about 22. This was before my PD traits were in full bloom, and I think of those years fondly because I was normal then. I could enjoy going out and the company of others. So in a way my thoughts of him are a memory of that, and a symbol of the hope that maybe one day I can regain some of that normalcy. And while the passing of time makes that seem exponentially more and more unlikely, I still have hope. Not to sound like a greeting card, but hope is a good thing. It's pretty much vital for me, or anyone who has a 
history of suicidal tendencies/idealization. But like I said, my find feelings for him are more about me than him. He's a badge for the fact that I was once less disordered. The fact that I've been able to keep a friend for almost forty years is a trophy more than anything else. You lost me with the second part of that question. If you're talking about appropriation, emotional or otherwise, I'm not sure that applies to schizoids. Most people cull their identities from their environment. Schizoids internalize everything, so even outside influences become uniquely their own, filtered through their sensibilities and then locked away from the world."

It may take a couple months for what I'm going to relay to him, for him to see the entire picture of what im trying to do. But it could blow up in my face, that's why im seeking his console. sigh... I'm going to put that thought into the back of my mind until I see him Monday evening. But it would clear the air regarding my issue--maybe. Or it could give more ammo to the person who wants to destroy me for some reason. It's crazy that the one person I think about the most also acted to try and destroy me over things she couldn't even understand, things I couldn't even understand.

175975457,"I'm okay with magic--although my parents probably wouldn't let me read it. They still won't let me read _NAME_. But they might not pay that close of attention to it with not having anything in the title to suggest magic. Bookblogger71 on Amazon said it juxtaposed mysticism with Orthodoxy in a good vs. bad battle (with Christianity being all bad). That's where I went uh-oh. I'm cool that people have different beliefs than I do. Everyone has the right to believe whatever they wish. This is America after all. I certainly don't want to force anyone to believe what I believe. But at the same time, I just bought a Russian Orthodox Cross necklace. My faith is important to me. So then I was sort of like, oh crap. My parents would totally freak out if they read any of it and I probably would be uncomfortable. But I want to like it. I even like the title. I love Russian history, Russian forklore, Russian names etc. I collect Russian stacking dolls. But I don't think I could get the second or third book past 
my parents anyway. One of them has ""Witch"" in the title. Even though there's the great classic book The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. For crying out loud, my parents didn't even let me watch Carebears or Smurfs because of the magic in it! But maybe I could check the local library to see if they have it and see for myself if it's what the reviewer described or that is just their opinion.

175975505,"Well thanks for the spotlight. Perhaps your _PERSON_ is aiming for an insurance claim against you. My reasoning is the job has a high turnover rate because it can be stressful and can risk some violence, so they're often short staffed. My boss is also very ""by the book"" and likes that I am too - and that I often do an excellent job with the people I support. They've almost instantly treated me like seniority as a result. Before this, I've always had asshole bosses. I also can have a hard time getting along with co-workers (externally or in my head), and it's not a problem there when I have to. There are a minimum amount of shifts you have to work a month and a maximum you can pass up in a row without losing your job. Since October, I haven't adhered to that. Because of the reasons above, they have allowed it, and have been thinking that, in the future, I'd meet number requirements. Their process of hiring takes at least a month or two, and then a similar amount of time to train someone new and in
tegrate them into working the more independent shifts. I've stepped back as mentioned, and they told me to take as much time as I need, and they'd rather I be in a good state. I think I will dissapoint my boss, and I don't know how likely I'll have one that treats me as well as she has again - at least not in the my current field. On a tangent that Doesn't pertain to me:"

Something happened to my chemistry & medications in my early 30's. Anything that is suppose to calm a person down has the opposite effect on me. Full blown allergic reactions to medications, especially antibiotics is a real challenge to treat me. In the end for anxiety my dr put me on Buspar & that really helped."
175975511,"Well, my friend left. I forgot to hug him because I was feeling faint etc from being out in the heat. So I didn't get my hug. We went out for lunch, which was very good. Went to the tattoo parlor but the piercer wasn't in. I'm so hot and dizzy."

175975519,"I got really mad at my mom yesterday. I don't know why. I just felt like she wasn't giving me validation - That I don't have schizophrenia and it's her fault. I said that I hated her. I don't know why I do that. I'm just traumatized that I didn't stand up for myself or my sister when I was being abused by my ex step dad and I didn't want it to happen again. It comes from regret and OCD thoughts of the past. I don't know why my OCD thoughts are bothering me so much about pointless stupid stuff that happened in the past. My sister talked to me and I was so apathetic and just started crying heavily because I was in so much mental pain - Maybe from phenibut withdrawal. I'm not taking the phenibut today and just going to withdraw from it completely. I don't want to throw it away though because it lifts my mood more than anything I've ever taken and makes me feel normal.. So Idk what to do about it.. I went to the store and bought zinc chelate, vitamin C, vitamin D, Advil and melatonin. I feel like life 
is extremely hard - I realize that that may be why people say that we go to heaven when we die.. Cuz life is hard af.. We deserve to go to heaven. Imagine.. I used to be an atheist until shroom.."

175975526,My family disowned me after my diagnosis and I still live with one that won’t even let me speak about any of my symptoms or my ptsd negative experiences. The whole family does the same thing and I feel like it’s family mobbing. Every one of them is narcissistic..possibly more like sociopathic or psychopathic since they covered up a crime done to me to save the other family member that did it to me. It affected my whole life and still does. I’m assuming they look down on me because of my diagnosis and they have something to blame besides looking in the mirror at themselves and the misery that they give out with a second though since my diagnosis in 1998. It’s frustrating and demeaning and if it happens within families it can happen on another level. People are Cruel and it’s best to watch your own back because not all people are empathetic and compassionate and want to the Best for You..some want you to hurt. Sad.
175975527,Could that have been a hallucination? I mean if you have the drain plugged with a stopper how would the bugs come up?
175975528,"The woman who wrote the column on being positive when trying to solve a problem, said in paraphrase: 1. Some people are good at solving problems, some aren’t.. 2. Solving problems is not a genetic trait. 3. Steps that can help: 4. Best thing for solving a problem is your attitude, times 10. 5. Think optimistically. If you think you aren’t going to solve the problem, you’re right. If you think you are going to solve the problem, you’re right. So, again, it’s not the problem, it’s what you’re thinking (unconsciously) about the problem going into it. 6. Being a pessimist is not genetic, it’s what we learned as children. 7. Problems often have more than one solution. 8. If you think in advance you’re going to solve the problem, you chances of solving it increase greatly. (Because your unconscious mind is dependent on what you think going into the problem. If you think you’re going to solve the problem your unconscious mind look for ways to do that. If you don’t believe you're goin
g to solve it, your same unconscious mind turns off it’s powers, obeys your childhood mindset of negative and looks for ways to fail.) 9. One step at a time. 10. Ask for help if you need it. Don’t ask for it if you don’t. 11. You’re not going to solve every problem, but you will gain experience. Which will help you with your next problem. 12. And lastly, if you can’t solve the problem, give yourself the same support you would give to any friend. One time, before I read this column, I had a big problem. Let’s say, I was in a dangerous situation in the room where I was. My conscious mind thought, open the door and walk out of the room. My unconscious, which had learned as a child to be negative, piped up with a counter-belief to that. It said, “The door is probably locked. Dive through the window.” I dove through the window (a negative because I got hurt), but I solved the problem because I got out of the room (a positive). This represented my mind (conscious is positive/unconscious is negative)
. I walked over to the door and turn the handle: it was unlocked the entire time. That’s a true story, in generalities. Two years later when I read the column and thought back to that tough situation, I saw my conscious mind at work. I remembered it saying: “open the door and walk out of danger.” I also saw my negative unconscious mind at work: “You can’t open the door and walk out of danger because…… (make up any excuse).” When you think positively before going into the problem that you can solve it, it opens up your unconscious that you can’t see, and your unconscious starts to look for solutions, rather than looking for defeat. If you’re negative unconsciously (and you don’t know because you can’t see it), it takes an actual key (“Think positive, Think positive, Think positive”) to open it. It will do either of those things equally well. But it must be set on positive before you begin looking at the problem. That’s why when thinking about how to get the car out of the back dri
veway, I did not think about getting the car out of the back driveway. I thought first about reading the column on being positive. And before I got to the fourth paragraph, my unconscious said, “_NAME_’s garage has a small wrecker. We’ve used it before.” While I was still consciously reading the column."

175975546,"Since the detectives violated my privacy by reading my journals after my mother's murder I have struggled to journal. Everyday I long for the feeling of the pen in my hand and the catharsis of putting it to paper. Even though it has been over 20 years, I am still struggling to journal. Those detectives stole a large piece of who I am and robbed me of a vital coping mechanism. I even struggle writing papers in school but I still get them done. I feel pressured to perform, so I do. With that said I have decided that I need to approach journaling the same way I approach assignments in school; I will do it because I HAVE TO. While I do not get the same catharsis from typing as I do from writing, this journal entry is a step in my reclamation process. I am determined to take my life back and a crucial piece of who I am is writing. This is my first time using this platform, so I am not sure how this works. I have seen others write a daily affirmation so I will follow suit. Today's affirmation: I deserve 
a good life. I am worthy."
175975547,I understand how you feel. So many of our issues are the same. But I also feel unworthy to bother people with my problems. I am also scared to tell people of my illness because they will look at me and judge me. I just want quality of life but the fear is real...

Look at the TV news enough to keep updated and informed about the virus and our country for awhile. Then I try to focus on whatever I can to get through the day. I read books,and listen to audio books, do necessary housework, meditate, listen to music and dance or exercise with it, talk on phone or text friends .

When I was having frequent panic attacks and high anxiety two years ago, that concept ( I mentioned something about my own medical experiences to someone with anxiety and it triggered their panic attack) triggered a major series of rolling panic attacks for me. That fear of inadvertently hurting others continued to be one of the main triggers for me. Now that I’ve tamed the anxiety some I realize that rationally you are coming from a good place when you share your experiences, you cannot control another person’s reaction nor protect them from everything, it may highlight something they need to continue to work on. just be as supportive as possible That’s all you can do!"

It was right after I finished the 3-4 month self ketamine treatment. It lead to no where though. I'm not doing much anymore. I think cuz people have put me down and I'm not on those dissociatives anymore. I can't take most drugs anymore because they cause depersonalization/derealization. I bought sarcosine and NAC to see if it will help with negative symptoms. I'm going to try and look over these notes and make goals from like 10% of what I was trying to accomplish for next week.

175119911,"_NAME_, my father passed away when I was 12. I am now 30. His medical history is not well known. I know he smoked cigarettes in his teens, marijuana not too long after. Maybe his late 20s early 30s was cocaine. At one point he was in a mental institute. I don't exactly know why. But he was able to sign himself out days later. I asked my mom, never thought to ask my aunt (his sister), if he had bi-polar. My mom thinks he did but never diagnosed. The sad news is that his mother was murdered. He blamed himself for that one. Supposedly she asked him to go out with her but he decided to stay home and get high. She was shot to death. I do remember Christmas times were rougher for him. He used to drink a helllll of a lot more than usual. My aunt told me that they (3 kids total) had a good childhood in general. He was raised to never hit a woman..... He FAILED on that one Yes, he was very abusive to my mom. She loved him very much, yet she was afraid of him. She knew his scary side. My mom and I, and somet
imes my brother, would hang out with family friends. When she knew he was angry, she told us to wait outside until she comes and gets us. When it comes to a negative household : that's a hit or miss. Yes my dad was abusive, but I was his ""little girl"". I guess it would be helpful to let you know that my brother is my ""half"" brother. I quote that because I don't like that term. My dad was not his biological dad. Anyways, I seen the abusiveness and sadness in the home. We got hit and treated poorly. Yet, I was treated special because I was the only girl on his side of the family besides the aunt. My dad used to take me to work (construction/handyman) every weekend. I loved it. I was such a tomboy. We spent a lot of time riding bikes throughout the city. I remember him crying because he was proud of me due to the hard work I put into school. I seriously cannot remember much as a kid. My therapist thinks I blocked the memories. I think she's correct... It was about two years ago when I hit my hand so hard lea
ding to bruised fingers. It was late at night. That next day I was off work and went to a walk in clinic because I didn’t know what was happening with the fingers. Lesson learned. More info on the family > I love my mom very much and give her credit for all that she’s done for us. BUT, we butt heads like crazy. The anger in me comes out a lot with her, very unfortunately. That night, I was talking to her about the past and finances. She is horrible with money. Always has been. One questioned I asked : Why did you stay with dad knowing how abusive he was? I’ve been wanting to know this for years. I finally got an answer from her. A true answer. I hated myself for how I talked to her to get that answer out. So I was mentally pissed off hard core. So, like I stated, I’d rather be in physical pain rather than mental pain any day. I’ve learned the past two years that realistically made TV shows, movies, and books cause me to feel down. The recent break down triggered once I finished a TV show series. It 
was a wonderful one, but it got me thinking about my past more than anything else. I think that was the tip of the iceberg for me. This COVID-19 situation has me feeling blah, especially working in the grocery business. I was supposed to have been married by now, but that changed. We are looking into buying a home but want to be married first. So my brain has been scattered for the worst. That Wednesday night I went to bed crying. That Thursday morning woke up crying. I didn’t feel quite right. I had maybe two hours of sleep and had to be at work in 45minutes. I didn’t care. I didn’t want to wake the fiancé. But I knew I couldn’t be alone. My mom lives with us, so I woke her up. It’s hard to explain what happened there. I went to work for half my shift. Thankfully I had a friend who was off work that day. My therapist also was able to schedule me in that day. I’ve truly been down since then, gradually making my way up. That’s why I am so happy I found this site/forum ""Maybe it’s because as c
hildren we learned about our self-worth from people who didn’t have any. And as children, we believed that."" > Holy smokes.. true statement. It's been about five years ago since my self esteem / self worth started to rise. I am very sorry you had to endure the life you did. May I ask how you felt with the misdiagnosing of medicine? Also I’d like to point out that the therapeutic part of this site is that I am able to know I am not alone, along with being able to talk about my life. Again, thank you all for sharing <3"

175975620,"Have an appointment with my psych NP tomorrow (over the phone). Last time we talked was a month ago, I started that new med topamax last month and haven't had any problems with it and it helps so that's good. And in general I'm doing really well. I mean, every now and then I'll have a kind of low day or 2 but that's normal life. I'm happy, haven't had a panic attack in 34 days. That's what I'm really shocked about, the lack of panic attacks. I don't know what changed, because before this it had been years of not being able to go even a week without a few panic attacks and sometimes even more/daily. It's weird. It's like something in my brain changed, in a good way. Maybe my faith is helping too. In addition to everything else. Because I am getting in touch with my faith again and that helped me a lot in the past. Today was day 25 of the year long daily Bible study. Just having that daily inspiration is helpful. Idk, I just enjoy things more, like every little moment. Drinking a warm cup of coffee, 
watching a good show, playing ukulele, reading, arts crafts, my hobbies, all the little moments. Staying in the moment. Yoga, having a healthy lifestyle. Or doing my best to do so. Just feeling really good."
175975621,"So, apparently my friend made his friend really happy for her birthday. She said they rented a car and that she'll tell me more tomorrow. I'm jealous and pissed off. I don't know how many days they spent together. Meanwhile there's a hanging in a corner of the bathroom. If it disappears I won't know where it went. My friend has been in a very good mood this trip. I sure don't make him that happy. All I am hoping for now is that he buys all the stuff I want (out of the money that I had in savings). First on the list, thanks to the threatened vape ban, is a Zamplebox. I can't stock up for a long time but I can hopefully have some decent juices for two months. Anyone who supports vaping should send a tweet (or two) to _NAME_. Things are really making me wonder what's going on. He said last Wednesday that he doesn't like vaping but he was impressed it's a multibilllion dollar industry, but he's considering a flavor ban. Within 72 hours he reversed himself, saying he liked vaping as an alternative to sm
oking. I'm wondering if he's really so flip floppy or is he playing a mind game on vapers. Anyway, if he does go through with the flavor ban he'll lose his second term. There are an estimated 10 million vapers in the US. If even a fraction of that number doesn't vote for _PERSON_ he'll lose. I believe he is well aware about vaping, I just don't know what he's doing."

He said one of his patients was having panic attacks and he couldn't focus so he put him on Vyvanse and it worked (His panic attacks went away). ""DPDR disorder produces a disturbing sense of detachment from one's body or surroundings, often as a result of psychological trauma. DPDR shares high diagnostic co-morbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) due to overlap of clinical features such as inattention and lack of cognitive inhibition.""

175975645,"Hi Ocean. Sorry to read that you are going through a difficult time. I understand how the issues you are dealing with at home, with your father-in-law, plus pain, plus a prostate cancer diagnosis, could cause you anxiety. Even if you do not have a pre-existing anxiety disorder, these events could cause you what is sometimes referred to as ""situational anxiety"" -- that is, anxiety brought on by specific events or circumstances. I also think there is a risk that various unrelated problems can become or at least seem -- overwhelming, if they occur around the same time. You might feel like you could deal with any one of the issues you are facing, if only the others did not exist at the same time. The answer may be to keep the various problems separate, to the extent possible, and make a plan to deal with them one at a time. With respect to the ""father in law situation,"" I wonder whether some counselling with you and your wife together could help. This might be relatively short term counselling, to 
help you come up with an approach that addresses the situation in way that you are both comfortable with, and that does not cause resentment or later regret. This sort of issue can be divisive and cause discord if it is left to fester. On the other hand, if you are able to find an approach that you are both comfortable with, it could make your marriage stronger. I have experienced vaguely similar marital issues and I found conjoint therapy (me and wife together) quite helpful. With respect to the prostate cancer issue, I see that you have posted on the HW prostate cancer board. There are a lot of very knowledgeable and helpful people on that board. It is a tremendous resource. My father had prostate cancer, and I have a high enough PSA to watch it carefully, so I am somewhat knowledgeable about prostate cancer. You are not alone among people with that diagnosis who have anxiety as a result of it -- especially during the time period when you are going through the process of selecting a treatment. Indeed, I thi
nk that sort of anxiety is the rule rather than the exception among men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer. You might want to see a therapist or a psychiatrist to help you deal with this issue. That might be someone separate from the ""marital therapist"" who helps you and your wife deal with the father in law situation. This person could help you process the feelings that arise from a cancer diagnosis, and if you are so inclined could recommend medication. There are a good number of guys with prostate cancer who take SSRIs or other meds. This may seem like ""a lot of therapy"" - with a marital therapist and a separate individual therapist. But it is what I have done and I do not regret it. Best wishes, my friend. Post Edited (medved) : 1/4/2020 10:05:07 AM (GMT-7)"

174369084,"This is what I think happened; Light aspie with OCD and ADHD, developed avoidant personality disorder at age 5-7, manic as a kid, got depression at 12 then severe depression and psychosis at age 16, took psychedelics, helped with aspie, OCD, avoidant and depression. Now when the injection wears off, I get quasi-psychosis caused by autism which causes manic like symptoms. Then when it kicks in, my brain doesn't have enough neurotransmitters to BE MYSELF. Unfortunately I got depression and that's the whole reason why I wanted to die. Now I don't have depression anymore cuz of the psychedelics.

175975659,"Lorasplora: You mentioned your general practitioner suggested taking Paxil and Lexotan. By typing in Paxil in the search engine, one of the sites said that it is used for depression and anxiety. When I typed in Lexotan, myvmc.com said that this was a benzodiazepine. It then noted, ""In general, benzodiazepines such as Lexotan should be taken for short periods only (2 to 4 weeks, for example)."" ""Continuous long-term use is not recommended unless advised by your doctor."" ""This medicine may be addictive."" Well, you know, like you did go to a general practitioner. Is there anyway you can go to a psychiatrist? For one thing, your difficulty sleeping may not be the main problem. It may be a sign of a mental illness. In my case, it's not so much that I have trouble sleeping, it's that I have bipolar and I have trouble sleeping. To treat the symptom doesn't treat the main problem, it covers it up. If you get the wrong diagnosis, such as can't sleep, you get the wrong medicine. First, they have to diag
nosis what is the underlying problem. And then give you the right medicine for that. If you go to a psychiatrist, he or she will first want to try to determine if you have an overall mental condition like anxiety or depression. Then they can first give you an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medicine, then maybe give you something for sleep, or like me, you could perhaps even take something like Melatonin from the health food store for a portion of the sleep problem. You said in your latest post, that Melatonin didn't work for you. I said in my reply that Melatonin wouldn't work for me, either, if I wasn't taking something for my bipolar (Lithium) and for my depression (Mirtazapine). So this indicates you have something more than just a sleep problem, for the Melatonin by itself didn't help you with sleep. As the net said, the benzodiazepines are for the short term. You need something for the long term. Again, can you look up ""psychiatrist for your hometown"" on your computer, or ""mental health or psychiatri
c clinic for your hometown"", which would have a sliding scale all the way down to zero? And set up an appointment? You think you can do that? ."

Around that time, there was abuse and marijuana use, I was sad, but so excited to see the world. And, I found it. I found a world around my world, a harsher one. And, it made my hallucinations turn harsh. Mind reading was the worst, and repetitive thought which was not my own. I could hear the earth and feel everyone's feelings, and, read their mind, too. I got into Tarot when I was 17. I am more than good at it. I can see plans for people's lives just by their thought and how they use their body language. The spirits help me. I can see their colours and I know what they think of me. And now I don't freak out when a negative thought is had, I can reiterate what I was saying to be less.. invasive or pushy. Palm reading, it is like, seeing a picture on a hand. A long life? A frayed life? A solid and direct love? A lonely and desperate heart? I can see it. My psychotic natu

This isn't a decision made out of desperation or emotion. I never thought I'd say this but I have come to realize sometimes the only way to peace is through leaving this world. Counseling and therapy - did all that, inpatient and outpatient, but the only time I feel peace is when I think/dream about never having to feel like this anymore, i.e. getting out of here. My family WILL understand because I know it hurts them so much to see me in such agonizing pain and I know they will feel my relief. I hope I have explained it to a degree that each of you will understand it and possibly understand others that feel the necessity of this cou

I seen him about a week later, he looked at my results from the hospital on his computer and said I was fine.that was two months ago. I’ve been doing pretty good with managing my anxiety and self coping. But today was very ..... off. I woke up shaky and anxious. Palpitations in my chest. And then my mom called me about her cardiology results. She has a blockage in her heart and needs to have a stent put in the blockage. It triggered me and I’m worried. So about two hours ago 
I was cooking dinner and was very very anxious. My heart started pounding, my stomach began to turn, and the nausea set in. I took my blood pressure. It was 117/73 and my heart rate was 108. I’ve beven trying to self soothe and use my coping skills, but old thought patterns and behaviors are trying to resurface... I’m really scared. What if I have a heart attack? Or go into cardiac arrest??? I just really need someone to talk to ??????????? More On Anxiety Panic Disorders Coping With Holiday Anxiety How Social Media Affects Your Mental Health"

I understand your frustration with parents buying you useless crap that you don't want and having to feign gratitude. It's something I've had to deal with as well.

175975748,I have always dealt with social anxiety and have been struggling with my work and relationship with coworkers. I havent been sleeping well and worried about my future. I realize this isnt new but it has been weighing on me heavily. I have two jobs now and am struggling with knowing how to talk to people and wanting to avoid them entirely. I dont have any friends and only have my family. There are certain work related relationships that I dont want to tell them about but I dont have anyone else to tell and maybe if I just vented out what I felt then it would help. If I could talk to someone in a similar situation maybe it would help. I feel like I shouldnt be this weak that I should have more confidence and happiness but im not happy and part of me knows why but also part of me thinks I'll never change. Im scared I'll be unhappy all my life.

His medication was just upped and he has only one appointment with his therapist under his belt - another coming up this weekend. I think it does bring him peace but it worries the ***** out of me!

I originally had a legit use for the meds. But it got out of control. I used to be a police officer and lost my job because of it. You need to talk to your doctor if you have one. If you don’t, you need to get one. They can point you in the right direction. Don’t be so embarrassed and ashamed that you can’t ask for help. You’re young and have a great future ahead. And so many possibilities in front of you. You just need to ask for help. It sounds like you’re ready. Good luck!"

I told my sister that I was exhausted from work and she said something like ""Yeah well now you know what it feels like to work like a normal person"". **** sake. I can't do anything right. I'm always exhausted and have no idea what I'm doing. Possible trigger: I had suicidal thoughts at work today but it feels like no one cares and I have to just not be a person I'm on a long acting stimulant - That's what I get. And if I ask for a short acting one where I can control the dose, I look like a drug seeker because I switched stimulants too many times."

She has however, not had a high temp like last sunday night causing the seizure! That was the most frightening night, she is only 1 yr old and seeing your baby laying there limp and with purple lips was horrible, thankfully she is on the mend now .

175975769,"I feel trapped right now. I need to find a credit consular to get my life back to the way it was before my illness, financially speaking. I make okay money, I mean, for 2019 I suppose, even though wages have been so stagnant for the past 20 years. I do exactly what an ex coworker did 20 years ago and he made the same amount as I do now. That's crazy right? I should be making 1/3 more for sure. I guess I'm hurting so much b/c now I'm on payroll so I don't need to worry about taxes, which lightens the load when it comes to winter. Still, I'm skilled labor. I spent the entire day juggling ladders in the sun so everyone else can have an easy day. I guess I shouldn't complain. I could start my own business... But the stress 24/7 from that I couldn't handle with my illness. I'd lose so much sleep. Case in point: carpenters laid a wood floor throughout the entire house. Then they called in the painters. My boss cut all the ceiling lines in the house. We came back the next day and there was blue tape throu
ghout the house on the new wood floors. The wood floors were so cheap that our stool feet made an indent, it was like the flors were made of cottage cheese. He had to pay for almost all the wooden floors, and this was during winter. He couldn't blame anyone."

175975772,Yes I did
175975773,"""Because organizing your thoughts requires a lot of self-control and mindfulness, and because not so many people are actually capable of such a thing. Here are some tips from what I recently started to do in order to stop being a victim of invasive thoughts (a thing I’ve suffered for years and still deal with) : practice a form of activity that does not require you to think and, most of all, that can learn you how to stop thinking. I personnally chose yoga and meditation, because it was not far from home and it happened to be very surprising. The effects on your mind and body appear within 3 to 5 weeks depending on how regularly you practice it. Two times a week was a good start. Our yoga teacher taught us how to, instead of fighting against them, let the thoughts flow in your mind and body. Surprisingly, they vanish by themselves if you let them flow, whereas if you struggle against them, they will keep haunting you again and again, forever. Don’t forget that anyone who is vulnerable because 
of any situation often tends to keep bearing things that are negative for them. So I would suggest you to give this method a shot, if you have time for it of course. practice a form of activity that is properly physical, such as running, swimming, etc. It aims at bringing out some tiredness inside your body and mind, and thus all the thoughts that are difficult to get away from will then again vanish in your mind. Don’t forget that human modern ways of life usually lead to various worries and thoughts that would have nothing to do in the mind of someone who, at the end of the day, is tired enough both physically and mentally to stop thinking with negativity. Since I started to run along the sea 2 to 3 times a week, I feel like invasive thoughts are no longer a significant part of my mind. However, while running or swimming, you must let all your thoughts flow in. It really works. But as I said it, I have time to spend in such activities. last but not least, accept the fact that being able to organize your t
houghts can take a long, long time and persevere even if it doesn’t work immediately. Organizing someone’s thoughts would be comparable to organizing a messy room full of things you wouldn’t have even noticed was existing. It can also make you suffer, because as your “surface thoughts” flow and get away, they will reveal your deeper, intimate thoughts. And absolutely no one can predict what’s hiding here inside even when you think or try to convince yourself everything’s fine. Somedays it can be terrible to endure, but don’t feel discouraged. It is worth the journey. I really hope I’ve helped a little ! Have a nice day, _USER_ID_"""

175975782,Have you considered backing off the drinking to see if it helps? Alcohol isn’t great when you’re dealing with depression. It just drags you down more. Sorry about the bf. I don’t really know what to say about that. My husband and I pretty much don’t hang out until night time and I’m good with that. He comes home and we usually have coffee and cigarettes together for 1/2 an hour or so. Then he goes outside to tinker with his **** and I do my own thing with the kids. Before we had kids he worked 16 hour days 6 days a week at the minimum so we didn’t see a ton of each other then either. I think you really need to try to find some happiness in being on your own. He has to work and you could see less of each other once you start working. Carve out your own place. It’s the only way you’re going to be happy. You can’t rely on the bf to make you happy. You have to do that yourself. Find some peace in your own world. Also from the other side of the coin...it’s really really hard to have s

I have your address. I was always insecure with the anti-climactic ending. briefly put--it sucked. Now the ending is spot on, super mythic, and I nailed it finally. I finally worked it out and I brought it all together like a crescendo. I still have a few minor tweaks left though to get pagination and headers working. _PERSON_ in his Work Faust wrote his book the same way. I think it's because _PERSON_ was kind of mingled with who _PERSON_ was, and he always added upon it throughout his life. In it he wrote a poem about how it was like patchwork, as he tweaked this, and added that. His first bits started to release in 1790 until 1831 when he finally released it before he past away. There were parts that he still wished he was able to complete, such as a debate between Faust and the devil among the faculty and stud

175975814,"What if I was in a constant autistic ego death until age 21 (After I did psychedelics)? I met someone on tripsit chat that said he was in a constant ego death until age 20. He said he had severe aspergers. Psychedelics apparently can increase pattern recognition or decrease it. For me, it made me solve the paradox in my mind so it increased it dramatically to 100% a few years after my trip. Now it's just up to my cognition. Now I know exactly that IQ test questions are all have the same property of the paradox (I knew this before but it was like being blind to ""Is that how reality really works?"" with the left right, male female, end start, up down, etc etc)"

175975828,"Today I only angered my mom more and she said that my friend would make a better daughter which I honestly do agree on and opting out of existence would be nice but not possible. To sum it up I got up after she asked for help and then she said if I was just gonna look like that I may as well just go back to bed, which I did, and then she got mad and started screaming at me about hating me, ###$ you etc etc, I didn't feel like helping at that point at all since she was so mad which I guess was a bitch move. The next day,(which is today), we talked about it and I told her I took it seriously what she said since she said it seriously and she said it wasn't serious and that ""everyone else/anyone else"" would have realized she wasn't. She brought up she does nice things for me and got me stuff I didn't ask for so I said I didn't needed them and it was just money wasted which is true in my opinion since I didn't need it. That only made her more mad and in my mind if I were a parent I'd be fine with not 
having to spend a bunch of money just because. She says it seems like I don't care enough and she does so I just told her to stop caring as much which she said she can't. She asked if me giving her a present on Mother's Day made me feel good and I honestly said it was just so that she didn't get mad which made her more upset. She's brought up multiple times that it seems like I'm just acting like this because I'm lazy and don't care about anything or think it's funny which I've said before I can't express emotion. I'm just tired of it and the only way to please her would to fake a bunch of emotions and act like someone else which would be too much effort but then she'd probably call me a manipulator since my dad is one. Idk why I'm posting this, just tired of it"

175975831,"Have you noticed that along with your own diagnosis of Bipolar 1 or Bipolar 2, other symptoms or diagnosed illnesses come along for the ride. These illnesses say, “She does not have quite enough yet on her plate, what with the and all bipolar buiness, let’s add a little more.” Thank you , whoever you are. A comorbid condition can also be known as comorbidity. A lot are psychiatric but a some are medical as well. Regardless, you need to take them into consideration for the management of your own good health. The following is a list of some of the comorbid conditions of bipolar disorder. Substance Abuse Disorders About 60 percent of people with bipolar disorder have a problem with substance abuse. Substance abuse includes the over use of alcohol or the use of drugs, perhaps both. Often times a substance abuse problem will occur to someone who presented bipolar development at a young age. Those who experience mixed episodes and those who have a family history of substance abuse are also a target
TREATMENTS: Doctors stress that is important to treat both bipolar disorder and substance abuse disorders and that can occur in a dual diagnosis recovery program. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/07/06/comorbid-disorders-with-bipolar-disorder/?li_source=LI&li_medium=popular17"

175975835,I am super depressed right now. All my normal coping mechanisms are gone right now because I'm not stable enough to do them. I can't really go into detail on here...I'll message you privately.
175975836,"So, I’ve had no choice but to stay at my kids fathers house for the past 6 months. We are on and off. had my own place then I moved which was a mistake and ended up here which I didn’t want to be. Anyway, is this normal or is this ocd... I do have ocd issues and I see a therapist. but not sure if this is part of it. Basically, I can’t stand living at someone else’s place, it’s his not mine, I’ve always had my own place but I’m finding things really stressful and makes me physically sick like how the interior is, how things are placed in the kitchen. The carpet has made me feel ill because it’s old. I feel like I have no sense of control or order because it’s not how I would have things. The way he had his couch was so stressful and one day he changed it and I felt soooo much better. I have felt so sick and stressed staying here that I’ve had to fight back tears. The same thing happened when I went to stay at my parents place for a while, I couldn’t stand how dirty and untidy i
t was and also the interior drives me nuts. Nothing is aligned properly and isn’t symmetrical, it causes huge stress and anxiety. I feel uneasy and can’t relax. I don’t think I’m ocd about cleaning etc when I have my own place but I do have a standard, I don’t mind if things get a little dirty or messy if it’s my place, I’ve had to let it go because I have kids. But if it’s someone else’s place, I feel gross. Is this just the norm when you don’t have your own place? I don’t feel me and kids dad are compatible relationship wise and I can’t wait to move out into my own space again, but it’s made me think, I don’t think I could ever live with him because of how I feel. When he watches football on tv, my anxiety is through the roof, I’m not sure what it is but I absolutely detest the noise and commentary, not sure what that’s about. I cannot even be in the same house, I have to leave when it’s on. Will I ever be capable of living with someone? Is it just because me and him are so 
different or is it ocd. I need things in order to feel good and relaxed and it’s just out of control at someone else’s place to the point it brings me to tears and makes me feel sick."
175975837,"I realize that in order to protect myself, I can't hoard. Like what if someone just comes up to me and wants to look at what I'm doing on the computer? Am I just going to let them see all of my posts on here? Many things I do to protect myself which is why I can't smoke weed. The hoarder person smoked a lot of weed for years."

I should have punched him right in the ****ing face on the shop floor, got a grinder and waved it in the air dare anyone come near me. I say I'm doing well sometimes but I just have to accept that I'm somewhat unstable and will always try harder than I would without mental illness and a really ****** isolated adolescence. Oh and btw I was feeling better after watching some podcasts and _NAME_ Talks. Now I feel like I'm being possessed by the devil again. But I'm good. I'm not a sociopath. I am tortured by my own mind. I have no desire to hurt people. Just the ones that need to learn a lesson. But I always get blamed for **** that I didn't do. It happens all the time since I was a kid. I just have **** luck."

Frankly, not only is there ""no shame in feeling like an outsider"", outsiders are in a position to observe how society harms the individual. Society is increasingly shaped by media moguls, who have mastered the art of using human insecurity to choke the voice of the soul."
175975864,I have been really struggling with feeling alone and just in a dark place. Like not being able to see someone who brings me so much added joy you never really realize how much you cherish so many people in your life. But distance physically and having restrictions really sucks and you lose that sense of hope as this pandemic continues and you just wanna be able to hold that person or kiss that person again and they are so okay with the situation that it’s hard sometimes to get the way you’re feel across in a way they would understand how hard these times really are for you. I just need and want this to be over like everyone else because I wanna feel whole again ?
175975865,I might be too stressed to work but I'm going to try it anyways. I'm not perfect. My cognition has big chunks missing and my memory feels dissociated. I'm not confident - Don't believe I'm worth anything. This is the best I can do. I hope I don't end up quitting cuz then I'll feel like a failure. I feel like I'm going down mentally and things will just get worse. I don't believe that I will live long - It's not possible with this mental state. My mind is torture. All I want is for people to stop messing with me. The torture never ends and my mental health is worse than when I was 16. I should be admitted to the hospital in comparison to back then but right now it would just make me worse. There's no going back. I think this is the end of ever getting better. All the good things about myself are gone or they were never there in the first place. It was all lies. But I'll try until I can't take anymore.

The hardest decision was moving out. Now that I am and making my own decisions my life is far better by like 100x than it was (besides having the enduring love and safety of my dad and sometimes mom), with how I lived and my decision making and so much more. The only thing I can say I don’t have is, financial security. But I swear to you, for my life anyway, might life is still far better. I’m not saying yours will be the exact same way and idk about anyone else here, but I personally was highly hindered by parents and them wanting things to go their way or what they thought was best for me. And it wasn’t I learned. Of course I still heed their precautions on what I do but I don’t like it hinder me from trying new things or business risks or moving risks etc. It’s been fun being independent!"

175975894,"Working, while living with bipolar disorder, can be a real challenge. Some of us are on disability because our illness disrupts our life so much that we cannot work. Even though we might be deemed disabled, we are still encouraged by Social Security to work. My most recent jobs ended due to my mental illnesses. A few years ago, I was working as a barista at a very busy coffee shop in Nashville. We had a line of customers at all times. I was usually on the register talking to the customer because, let’s be honest, I stunk at making espresso drinks. I was anxious at the job. Soon I was anxious on my way to work. Finally, I was anxious to go before I even left the house. I felt physical symptoms like the urge to throw up. It was like being a barista with stage fright. After a few months, I turned in my resignation. Picked up my last tips and moved on with my life. My next job, in Durham, North _USER_ID_, was at a brand new clothing boutique. During my interview, the owner told me she had goggled me 
and, thus, knew I was mentally ill, specifically with bipolar disorder. She was also a psychologist and had knowledge about mental illness. She asked me whether or not I was up to the task of working at her boutique. I told her I wanted the job and she hired me. My job was to be the lead fashion stylist for the shop – I thought that mainly meant dressing the mannequins and staging the front window, it also meant working the register. Right as I started the job, I was directed to change medications. As many of us will say, medication changes are the worst and with this one came the brain fog. This one made it especially hard for me to grasp how to use the register. For some reason, it was too complicated for my brain to figure out. She tested me once at the register when just she and I were working. I could not figure out the right way to navigate a sale. She “let me go.” She told me that as much as it hurt me, it hurt her more. Right. Do not get me wrong, a lot of people with mental illness work and do 
so successfully. I guess I wanted to share those two bits of information to say, “It is okay to fail or to not be able to do certain tasks or jobs because of our mental illnesses,” as well. There is a lot to consider when working and living with bipolar disorder. Consider the length of your workday and workweek. Is that something you can handle? Remember that some of your medications make you sleepy which could affect your work performance. Find a job that works with your lifestyle and schedule. For me, that is writing. I do it when I can, at times when I can. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/09/07/working-while-living-with-bipolar-disorder/"

I was watching Little Women on PBS last night. Great show. Love the movies too. HUGS all, _PERSON_"
175975908,"If my mom is telling us to do a November move in date, then I don't need her for anything. Not sure why she is talking to me like telling me what questions to ask them and such. And telling me not to be afraid to ask them... like...??? I'm not afraid."
175975909,Awesome!!
175975910,Bad news for my family.... Possible trigger: my sister has liver metastasis which means stage four cancer with only an 11% survival rate at five years from now....I don’t know what to do or how to deal with this really.

175975913,"Yup, took everything."
175975914,Thanks. I put in like 1.5 years just about. I have probably 1 year left -- maybe a little more depending on how long it takes me to write my thesis. I just sent an email explaining everything to the program director. I hope he can help me.
175975915,Thinking back for the last while even the last couple years I thought I was stable but it’s all adding up to little hypomanic episodes where I didn’t think anything was wrong because I felt happy but not weirdly out of control so I don’t think I’m as well as I thought I was.
175975916,My sister wasn’t clear on that she said it was confusing...I guess the doctor was at the grocery calling her so it can be really a lot of numbers and letters without them being written down.
175975917,"Ah, I think I understand. When I'm on medication there's thoughts I can't access too. People tell me I am just thinking too fast but I don't think they are there."

175975921,I've been making a mental collection of books about writing that I want to buy/borrow from the library (once they open again). The last one I read was Writing Down the Bones by _NAME_. _NAME_ King _NAME_: Reminiscences of My Life in Camp. It is a memoir of an African American woman who lived through the civil war. I want to borrow some short story collections by _NAME_ once the libraries in my town open again. They don't have them available for digital download. I'm wanting to read widely in the genre I want to write in so I'll be checking out the library's available short story collections for digital download to my kindle. I'm going through From Surviving to Thriving by _NAME_ again. Women's Wisdom: The Garden of Peace for Women by Rabbi _PERSON_.
175975922,"Yeah, I think the black dog has to do with depression but he also bites me. My T hypothesisizes that it has something to do with unmet childhood needs that are trying to get my attention or something like that. IDK I was kind of dissociated when she was talking about it. I usually have religious visual hallucinations or animals or children. But the dog is the only one that bites. It doesn't feel like a real dog bite. But it feels like a sensation. It's kind of weird. But lately he's been licking me too and laying by me, not as aggressive since my T talked about him like an unmet need. I sort of felt bad for him instead of just being afraid of him. I'll try the three senses thing. I made myself read a book yesterday which I finished. I was about halfway through the book so I read 200 plus pages yesterday. I used to really enjoy reading but haven't enjoyed it as much the past couple of months. So I made myself do it to see if I would enjoy it. I sort of did but not as much. I have lost my ability to 
enjoy a lot of things. But sometimes I find if I still do them anyway I get some enjoyment out of them, just not as much. I have two new books to read too so I'm going to force myself to read those."
175975923,having a lot of anxiety here lately. I keep getting the feeling that I'm gonna die. Not sure what or why but I don't even want to get into a car because I feel like it's gonna crash and kill me.

175975928,It's only 2pm... I thought it was like 5pm.. Nice.. I picked up my meds from the pharmacy - Lot of med refills so I have extra. They want me to take half a zopiclone now instead of a whole one because the olanzepine should work good for sleep. I put my meds in a zip-lock bag with a piece of paper saying how many pills there are (So no one attempts to steal them and so my mom knows what I'm taking) and vitamins in the bathroom cabinet. I filled up a weekly med box so I won't be taking anything out of the cabinet for a week. All the meds in my signature is all I take - So imma drink a coffee. I've been drooling because of the olanzepine.. But I feel cognitively fine.. Better than yesterday even. My whole family is happy that I'm home and doing better..

The three main things are my music (listening to), situation comedies (for some reason I feel ""normal"" when they are on), and my dog. When her and I are both relaxed everything feels okay. There are other things that make me happy. Watching the birds we feed, getting out in the wild life, nature and trees. Cooking a good meal. Making peanut butter cookies and eating them. There are so many small things that I can appreciate and that makes me happy. Good thread OceanFisher. I hope you have a good week. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175975937,"Today has been a really good productive day for my environment. I woke up and got out of bed before I took the Vyvanse (I've only did that like twice this year), did chores and then spent 2 hours organizing my room so I could put the TV closer to my laptop - Cuz where I had it was non-aesthetic and horrible.. I'm telling you guys that my environment is killing my soul sometimes. If I had a gaming/computer room like Newtus, that would be awesome. Maybe when I move to the island, I'll have a better living area where I'll be more comfortable. Things are good. Praying that I don't have another panic attack when the Vyvanse wears off. My therapist phoned back and is waiting for a call back from my psychiatrist. If she doesn't call back, I'll have no psychiatrist and just my doctor to monitor me. If he chooses, he can set me up with a new psychiatrist or deal with me himself. I want my meds to stay the same basically. They're good. I get my injection on Friday."

I recently discovered artists, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, are quite similar in style to _PERSON_ski. It's kind of nice to have more to discover in a belovedly similar style, but it also slightly takes away from the ""magic"" of his art. Also, I feel like I would have been diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder when I was a kid if it had been thrown around like it is these days"
175975950,"That’s been me too. I had to actually put way too much pressure and force on them to acknowledge that I did in fact have a problem after a certain point just to get treatment. I didn’t care about what the label was just as long as I got treatment, I was just sick of being told I was too oh so very high functioning and too oh so very intelligent to be having an actual problem at the time.

175975952,"Need some insight guys.... I feel on top of the world right now. Like I am enlightened and all powerful. I heard garbled nonsense last night and a fading figure behind me when I looked around. No one else saw or heard it. I grew up hearing whispering voices pretty frequently, all the way into adulthood. It scared the crap out of me. I remember once asking my dad if the eardrum could make sense on its own without a source and he said no. I think I was hearing stuff on my own. Also it was very common for me to hear someone call my name and no source. I used to go into rooms asking if someone called my name and people were like no. It all vanished on APs. Then crap like believing I had a chip implant as a teen and believing lots of my dads crazy beliefs too. Like I could control people with my mind, move objects, do supernatural things with my powers etc... I feel like I am cured right now of everything. Anyone have thoughts?"

175975955,"For weight loss I would say go to a dietitian or a regular doctor not a nutritionist. I went to one and she didn't do anything for me, she was useless. Don't give up, you have something to live for. I suggest go for walks outside rather than the gym, it's much more refreshing. Watch the birds or the clouds in the sky. Try not to buy any junk food or keep too much food in the house and go for a walk if you're restless instead of eating and maybe join a sport like swimming? All the best."

These past two to four weeks have been horrible my anxiety has been through the roof . plus I have a flare-up with my ulcerative colitis. My niece and sister are going through some tough times right now and it's really taking a toll on the Family. It's hard to see loved ones go through difficult times. I'm trying to be there the best I can but with my anxiety and panic in my stomach so out of whack right now I feel bad I can't be there as much as I should. I do text my sister constantly. I just feel right now this is never going to pass I'm sick of crying. I do see my therapist Tuesday. Has anybody else had severe anxiety over Family Matters and how did you deal with that. Thank you for listening. Hi. I can attest that anxieties over family issues is one of the greatest challenges I face every day. Sometimes, I get so tired and want to quit. I think our love keeps up climbing even with rocks tumbling down upon us. Ultimately, it is a gr
eat strength we have because we sometimes go through pure agonizing times and physical pains because of our love. I occasionally remind myself of this and it seems to help me to keep going."

I've been thinking about killing myself that's all I think about so I dont know when but iam going to try it soon. The only reason why I write in here is cause of a promise I made to at least tell someone before I try I am not worth saving my head is all fucked up with voices and seeing shit like demons It would be better if I was gone

That's why they always bring up stuff that happened a long time ago. It is surprising though how they know so much about me. I wish I could find traces on the internet or whatever they are using. I always see them using their phones. Once I caught one of them getting orders from someone to harass me. I seriously doubt they can read your mind. But regardless you should be careful out there, they are targeting you from the sounds of it. Do they harass you with insults and mockery? Do they follow you around and stuff?"

Anyone found a dosing schedule on Buspirone that provides consistent relief? Thanks so much."
175975999,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if I should get a second opinion. I had someone tell me that I wasn’t schizoaffective/schizophrenic. I told them I hear whispers. But he said that was normal and I mostly likely have Aspergers. After the session I felt really distrustful of mental health providers and it stemmed into my paranoia. The provider said if I was schizophrenic I would have had trauma and I didn’t look like I had it. Any info would be helpful. Thanks."

175976015,"Thanks emillionth , that's a really good point. On reflection a lot of my feeling disconnected comes from expectations from others rather than a lack of connection. I feel like I'm expected to feel things or care about things that I just don't. I do feel connected to some people at some times though, particularly when binding over common interests. For example, I love the game where two people list book or tv interests till they find a match, and then recommend new things to each other. I guess I just assume that if I didn't make an effort, I'd start by feeling relaxed and comfortable, but I'd eventually become lonely and start obsessing over what I was missing out on. Am I the only person who watches romantic movies and gets teary about the relationship between the lead and their sidekick?

175976020,"So, I don't know how clear i can make this. Um that's all I do is listen to people problems. I listen to people so much that it has drained me. Matter of fact I'm the first person they call if something happens to them. If they need to borrow money, if they're boyfriend or girlfriend dumped them and if they just feel like crap. They call me and talk and talk and ask and ask. But let's say I need a shoulder to cry on. I never get that. So, i have taking a step back and decided to think about my self for once. And my post was about how some problems aren't as serious as people think. Because they have support from people that value them. So, let go of the negative energy sometimes and embrace the love. Cause some people don't have that. Nothing about not letting people in or not listening to them."

I’ve been taking it in the day because when I was taking it at night I couldn’t sleep well and I notice that since I’ve started taking it I’ve felt more energy. Especially compared to seroquel.
175976022,I’ve never worked with it before! They had a super sized crochet hook on sale for $1.97 and this yarn was just so pretty and soft I couldn’t resist. For sure would consider making more blankets with really large yarn.

175976030,Hi Welcome to the forum. It does sound like you are dealing with anxiety I would suggest you make an appointment with your doctor and ask them about getting a referral for some talking therapy such as CBT or CAT as both work well at treating anxiety. In the meantime have a look at our resources section for some good links to self help sites on the web. Keep us posted. _PERSON_
175976031,"I’m excited. I get paid tomorrow. Including my work bonus. Going to pay off my one credit card with it, put the balance of another credit card on my line of credit, and also put some money on my last credit card. I put in an application to see if I can increase my line of credit. That way I could maybe put all my debt in one place with a low interest rate so I can pay it off sooner. If I keep my head down and don’t buy random needless ****, limit my spending - I should have it paid off in no time."

There isn't a family history of mental illnesses, etc. I've just been struggling for awhile like I mentioned above. I was fine not long ago just stressed at times. It's anxiety throughout the day and voices at night falling asleep. I get really vivid dreams. I've tried so many different positive things to try and help myself feel better. I've asked for professional help and advice online. I just wish I could find an answer to all of this."

175976041,"So very tired. And not happy with work. The whole work thing is like messed up on their parts. I'm 6 months in and just now turning in my application to get a certificate. Which shoulda been on month 2 or 3. I have a whole bunch of stuff planned. I dont think _NAME_ get much from my tax refund cuz my work history. But, _NAME_ will, and I'll get a very tiny bit. So we might do 1 of 2 things. Put that towards debt or down for a house. But then theres that. The house. I'm gonna do a pre-approval and see how much we can even afford. Then we can start putting down debt and saving up for a house. I think now is the time to know, given how long itll take to save up plus the whole process of buying one. We are thinking a manufactured home. But then we have to buy land. So we are thinking: 1. Cheap rural land 2. Get usda rural loan 3. And then get a brand new manufactured home. I read what goes into a manufactured home. And companies around here will do a lot of extra stuff that comes with the price of a ho
me. Plus usda rural loan pays for something, idr, either closing costs or something else, and then low interest rate, etc lots of other things. We will see. Work as it is...idk...I'm being micromanaged. Plus, just other little things. Plus I'm supposed to have a second PSS there with me, and I dont. And my application isnt even in and it's been 6 months. Like idk. I was ok sitting in my bosses office for the first 3 or 4 months but I'm still doing that. I'm not really working with but a few people, but I'm still considered in training, and idk. Just lots of stuff. It's starting to get to me. And apparently I don't have a few things that everyone there should have. Like a tablet to do work on, for one, which is why I'm sitting at my bosses desk all day twiddling my thumbs, every single day. But if we have all our debt paid off, and have a child end of this year or beginning of next, then we will have tons and tons of extra money. Like if all our debt is gone, we would have like, idk, maybe 1000 or 1500 extra m
oney a month to use for whatever. And I think that's after groceries and gas. So like after utilities and rent, and then after groceries and gas. So that would be good. And I'm doing all this other stuff to make extra money like selling my writing basically to major magazines. Getting into the art district here. Writing books, etc. Lots going on. Plus other minor stuff. Gonna take my cat to the vet for a senior wellness checkup. She will be 15 this year. Nothing's wrong with her. Just want her a lot longer here with me. Doctors and therapy appts, too. Routine appointments. And I'm gonna start going to obgyn for fertility reasons. Etc."

175976046,"Hey Everyone, It's been a little while since I posted but I have been reading content and seeing how supportive everyone continues to be here. It's really nice to see. Recently I left a job that had me perpetually stressed and unfortunately imbibing too much with my favorite alcohol, wine. While I had been planning on leaving that work stress and stopping alcohol, both happened rather suddenly. Good news is my stress has plummeted (except for anxiety) and I have been booze free for 9 days which is a major accomplishment for me. Problem is I am having somewhat bad anxiety unspooling as it were. My spouse is super supportive and everyone I know has been encouraging, but this dang future uncertainty has me in one of those anxious moods that stick around for a while. I realize these situations just take time to resolve, but has anyone else gone through a change where they had an A-HA moment regarding managing anxiety? So far I've been using my usual coping skills, but this is a bit of a big life change 
for me. Thanks so much!"

My post was detailed and took me a while to write, I was up til 3am writing it, with the sole purpose of helping people. I didn't save a copy of it and now it's gone (also please help me to retrieve a copy of it).

If you're real worried about something and deep down you know that you're anxieties about it are way out of proportion to the situation, does just knowing that you're paranoid about it calm you down (or at least help calm you down)? Sometimes I find that to be the case. However, it doesn't always work for me. How about you?"

I have been exercising daily and am going to scale back because I don't need to exercise daily, just five times a week is fine with me. I am happy!! I am taking my medication daily because the shots were not available at the clinic I went. I am writing a journal about taking my medication daily so it is working so far. I feel great overall. I lost some weight. I feel good about myself for once. Nobody is bothering me here!! Yippee!! And, the new company staff love me and told me I'm a star employee- whatever that means since I only started about two weeks ago. After covid-19 situation improves, I will have to show up in person to work though. We shall see how that goes!! I am going to keep myself busy no matter wh
at. I watched some homeless documentaries on youtube to remind myself how far I've come. I was homeless for awhile way back. Thus, I am ecstatic to be working again and doing a good job!! I have to remind myself no matter how hard it becomes that I need to take my medication!! I believe I will this time around. I have been through a lot. I am a positive thinker though. I realize if I put my mind to a task, I can accomplish it!! I have to sleep a lot though still after doing my assignments. But, this is better than not sleeping.

175976123,"I'm trying to figure out how to download a meditation track from an app on a really old iPhone. I don't do iPhones anymore and that app is no longer available even if I did. Oh Google, what did I ever do without you? Once I was stuck and I changed a flat tire on my own because Google was there to show me how. Google wasn't there (at least not in the form of a smartphone internet app) when I was learning how to drive though. I shredded the rubber off a tire because it went flat and I had been driving on the rim without knowing what was going on. The car was vibrating so hard and making thumping sounds - it was disorienting and scary - what rough and callous payment I thought myself to be driving along Google wasn't by my side when I was learning how to handle a stick shift either. I would have my window rolled down and I'd yell at people who looked like they were going to get in my way to watch out as I went around corners because I was still too afraid to switch gears. Many years ago my friend gave 
me a giant (non-crack) rock as a gift to keep in my car. He later told me it was incase I went off the road into a body of water while he was in the vehicle with me (to break a window to swim out) ^ In the past, other friends said that I should line - any car I drive - with tires, so that it becomes a makeshift bumper car. I never decided if I was offended or enthralled by how fun that could be. I'm afraid to drive trucks because they're so big to try to take on, but I don't know how to blame Google for this. Google can't solve everything - even if he's right beside you: I was in a parking lot about to pull out of my spot and some guy stepped out into the lot in front on me. I put on my brakes and he stopped at the same time. We both laughed and beckoned the other to move. I waited for him to move, but he didn't, so I decided to go. He moved at the same time as I pressed my gas pedal which made it appear like I had just lurched towards him. I braked hard as he stopped. He looked at me beseechingly as if askin
g if I was trying to hurt him. I winced and laughed and mouthed ""sorry."" Relief pass across his face and we both paused again. He didn't do anything, so once again, I pressed my gas pedal to go. Unfortunately it coincided with him stepping forward. Again. By the end of our encounter, he had no trust left in his eyes, planted there like a vulnerable blade of grass on an island of pavement. My embarrassment and the humor of the situation had me giggling away. At that point, he appeared to be frozen in trepidation of the person who, not only drove towards him every time he tried to move, but who was now openly laughing about it. He was no longer smiling, No longer willing to accept my apologies or even move. I drove away a bit disheartened that I couldn't convince him that I wasn't trying to hurt him."

175976127,"Hello, my user name is _PERSON_, I am a registered nurse and a baccalaureate nursing student. I am interested in learning more about your experiences with anxiety/panic, and even depression. I was suppose to do a community project but Corona came and I had to cancel my plans. My teacher is willing to let us do an online project. My project is based on anxiety/panic, depression, early intervention, and prevention of lifelong illness.I recently learned about ACE's (Adverse Childhood Experiences), and that made me really think about my own life and how I became who I am. https://youtu.be/95ovIJ3dsNk I have several family members who have anxiety/panic, and depression. I have also developed anxiety over my lifetime, but I didnt know thats what was wrong with me. As a young person I suffered several traumatic events that lead to PTSD or whatever this is. I find my way of coping is to plan, list, overthink. I always thought this was a positive, proactive, taking the bull by the horns. I would analyze eve
rything from several vantage points, only acting when it was a sound choice. Maybe this was healthy. However, as I get older, my kids get older, problems get bigger and bigger. Coping is smaller and quieter. I have worked with a therapist for several years. Initially it was to help me support my child. But... after about 6-8 months I realized it was ME, I was the problem. So my question for the community is did you know you had anxiety, panic, or depression, or did you discover it later on? How did you get diagnosed? What could have happened as young person to better serve you? Did you feel there were enough providers, or did you go through many before someone understood what was wrong? Over time did you feel like they were still helpful, that they helped as much as they could and you took a break, or did you not go into therapy, and why? How could the community of providers/offices have done better? What about family, how could they have understood better? Any specific experience with someone who was spot on 
and was very helpful, understanding, supportive? What were the things that stood in the way from getting help or being helped? I had been to several therapists in the past who were not helpful at all. Early on this was not something paid for by insurance so access was very limited. And while insurance has come a long way, there is still a long way to go as far as payments, providers accepting insurance, etc. Luckily I found an amazing therapist who i have seen for years, taken a break when things got a little too deep, and went back to 3-4 times. Im on a break right now, and even though I need to see her I cant because of this virus. Im going to just keep going to work, working on school, taking care of me and my family, and taking time for myself as often as I can. I hope you are all well and have someone who is willing to suffer through this with you. That is probably the best thing we can hope for in life. Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance to anyone willing to share their story. VioMin."

175976133,Gentleman's Dub Club - High Grade YouTube
175976134,"_PERSON_, a lot of doctors who can't look at you and diagnose you in their pre-determined medical book of diaganoises will say you're fine, and tell you to just get used to it or take antidepressants. For me and _PERSON_, and others I've spoken too, we never took antidepressants. So, while not entirely impossible to be YOUR cause, it wasn't ours. I will say, you should get off of anti-depressants with a set guideline to do so from your doctor. They're destructive and many have bad side effects and/or worsening of problems. Consider _NAME_ for a natural alternative for getting depression under-control. There's other options out there as well, for energy production and keeping your mind calm which all helps keep you well. Sadly, there's a lot of issues in the brain we can't see. MRI's are still incapable of going to a deep enough level to truly show everything. It's likely a brain problem, but that also means there can be a solution and coping through the brain. By not focusing on it, and negatively 
reacting to it, over a long period of time it does get better. It took me over a year, so it's not quick. Especially if you already suffer from anxiety and depression. Finding things that bring you joy, keeping yourself occupied and busy, are good ways to push through. Your mind is capable of ignoring things it doesn't find interesting or a threat. When we make it a threat, your mind will focus on it and you will get stuck in that cycle. It would be great if we could find a Neuro-otologist or Neurologist who CARED enough to involve themselves into this issue, but finding one who has the resources and expertise is difficult to find. 12345"

175976141,"Hi _PERSON_! Try to throw my thoughts in when I can. Ironically I kind of have a similar issue to what you described on your OCD post, though I was not diagnosed with OCD specifically. It was exacerbated by all the stress I’ve been under. I get excessively worried that I’ll say the wrong thing and make someone feel worse especially in regards to mental health issues. Accidentally set a panic attack off on a coworker once and that only fueled the panic in me. That was at its worst last year. I’m on buspar and Zoloft now and it made a huge difference along with therapy. Hope you get some relief soon!"

175976151,"Thanks everyone for your replies! So to clarify, I was taking Cymbalta because at the time I was on Zoloft and then some time after that diagnosed with fibromyalgia. So my doctor had me transition from Zoloft to Cymbalta. I originally had been on Zoloft for anxiety and depression, which I was learning to manage and was planning on getting off of it over the summer. But when I was diagnosed with fibro, that kind of messed up my plans. I decided to try Cymbalta, which worked fine during the time I took it. However, I’m not so sure I need meds for anxiety/depression anymore, and I’m curious if the fibro was a side effect from the Zoloft... Anyways, what happened was while working remotely this week I forgot to take a dose. I then decided to try getting off of it since I am remote all this week. I have next week which I will be working on campus again (I am a teacher) but then Spring break is literally the week after that. So I am thinking this may be a good time to try it... As of now, I am now at 
the 72 hour mark. Muscle fatigue has decreased and I am only experiencing slight “whoozyness” if I shift my eyes too quickly. Kind of feel like I am on cold meds or something."

175976163,"Reddit, facebook and schizoid.net, At reddit they always talk about other people or themselves, _USER_ID_ about either, maybe i could care about them if they had expiriences similar to mine, but they usually sound more awkward and proud than disordered. At facebook alot of self diagnosers, so the few actual diagnosed get outnumbered and outliked, i felt as if i needed to race for attention, no emotions=no attention, so its just unfair for me, i cant win, And schizoid.net are boring, i gave them up in 15 mins. I always feel like i have nothing to say, people talking about themselves and their problems and i only care if i have the exact same problem, and i almost never do, So i wonder if anyone is actually schizoid there, there is no overlap between my problems and theirs. Btw, do you have opinions? Alot of opinions threads in reddit too, _USER_ID_ about anything to have opinions on anything, so im also quite when people share opinions, i have opinions about society as a whole, but thats it"

174369762,"Antipsychotics decrease connectivity in the brain to allow psychosis to decrease (Along with everything else - Which sucks) but as time goes on, neurogenesis happens (Especially if you're under 25) to cause a crystalized contact with reality. Withdrawal of the antipsychotics increase connectivity in the brain to more than it was before you started them, worsening psychosis (Withdrawal psychosis) so neuroplasticity happens to make the psychosis a more crystalized psychosis so when you start the antipsychotic again, it's less likely that the antipsychotic will work. If you use a psychedelic while in antipsychotic withdrawal, it causes neuroplasticity AND neurogenesis to a previously crystalized state of psychosis, causing irreversible psychosis and schizophrenia."

175976182,"RAD kids are often mistaken as psychopathic kids. I believe it's a cop out. Look at the 90's _NAME_ ""Child of Rage"" interviews on YouTube (not the acting movie, the interviews). By 6 years old, she was trying to kill her foster parents on a regular basis, sexually harming herself until needing to go to the hospital to treat the wounds, sexually and physically harming her baby brother and killing and torturing animals, etc. She was even playing with the fear she instilled in them. She talks about it completely non-chalantly too. People keep referring to her as psychopathic, but her real diagnosis was Reactive Attachment Disorder. She received and responded to treatment. Now as an adult, she's trained to work with kids with as severe RAD as she had. * To note: the person who she went to do her live-in treatment with, went on to develop ###$ up treatments and was later charged for murder because she and someone else suffocated some poor child during a ""rebirthing"" technique. Severe physical neglec
t with infants can cause physical developmental delays or permanent problems and a lack of emotional and intellectual stimulation can do the same on the brain's structural development. We aren't born with fully developed brains, and some theories assert our environments dictate a fair amount of its development (though I believe neuroplasticity is a beautiful thing and full of undiscovered potential). I don't know how neglect impacts structures like the _USER_ID_ (trauma does though), but the frontal lobe is definitely affected. My brief understanding of psychopathy is that it's being seen as a developmental disorder, so the biggest difference would be the (supposedly) inherent brain structural abnormalities and thus, not requiring RAD's prerequisites of neglect and maltreatment. However, I'm certain there's some significant overlap there too; example: most psychopathic serial killers have been very badly abused. I'm guessing ""pre-psychopathic"" would be through the lens of the Diathesis Stress Model, so the 
genetics are already there but things like environment will determine whether and how it manifests itself. https://dictionary.apa.org/diathesis-stress-model Any kid in a #######5 environment learns to read people well. RAD kids are the ones who learn it almost as if it's their first language. They have the potential of reading people so well (off of seemingly no information at all) that you'd think think they were psychic. Yet, they remain completely unreadable themselves at the same time and they tend to have the emotional detachment to go with it, so they'll capitalize off it quite well. They can have major charisma, charm, ""hustle,"" and the best street smarts you'll ever see. My fascination is not in disorder or psychopathy or even trauma, but rather by being deeply bothered by society's double standards in choosing who they write off and then bitching and complaining when it blows up in their faces. Even more so, my interest is in the incredible and unique skills that could be invested in - along with w
ondering what skills would be helpful and how to present them in a way that would be most appealing and effective to learn. Lolz. You'll notice I always bring conversations back to my interest in the matter."

I can't work because my anxiety is so bad it literally makes me feel paralyzed. I have a teaching degree and I've been subbing for 3 1/2 years. I hate it! I literally was waking up every morning in a cold sweat and barely getting in 3 days a week. I finally got offered a job this year and my anxiety is so overwhelming I turned it down. I am not unhappy with my decision. I know I couldn't do it, and I did not want the students to suffer or have a mental break at work. But now everyone is mad at me , including my husband. I have student loans to pay back and have no idea what to do at this point b/c I literally can't get of the sofa. I am literally paralyzed with fear, worry and panic. I am al
so depressed and can not concentrate. I am arguing with my family and have terrible mood swings. I think the pressure of teaching and having to go to work everyday to a job that I HATE just set me over the edge and I""m having a hard time getting myself back. Through out my life any time I have have extreme pressure, stress my bipolar gets so bad I can not function. I have been to several different doctors, psychologists, csw and have had dr.'s prescribe many many medications. I DON'T do well on bipolar medications , side effects are awful. I'm currently taking Cymbalta 60mg. 1x a day, and I have Xanax but don't take it b/c it makes me feel worse the next day.

This is the first ****** night of sleep I've had in years. I think its cuz of phenibut withdrawal. I haven't taken it in 3 days. No alprazolam. Just invega, atenolol, vyvanse and zopiclone.. nothing else.. I've even been chewing normal gum instead of nicotine gum. Safe to say that I quit smoking cigarettes for good.. it's been almost 8 months since my last cigarette.. I'm doing good. Havent smoked weed in 2 weeks. That's all.. that's it.. no street drugs or weird analogues.. Been fasting too. I'm gonna get a blood ketone reader and maybe a glucose monitor.. The nihilism last night was at its worst before I went to bed. I wanted to tell the doctor that ""I don't want to kill myself.. I just really don't want to live.."""

175976213,Not sure how to go about it. Have to get off my ass and research it. No. I am more prone to fanciful thinking Always think its gonna be a masterpiece. It never is. As a career it must be hard to have to create what a client wants and put one's own tastes aside. As a hobby... yes... 'diddling' is a great description Artists now seem to struggle with originality. example.. the latest in this country was a penis structure ( for widows) that could be filled with the ashes of their dead husband... so they could make Love to them.

175976214,"Hello there! I hope you and your wife/family are having a good start of the day! You are very flexible husband, human, family man, and employee. I commend you for juggling your many roles that you part-take. flexibility is a great strength! Being flexible does not mean that you are weak. Nor does it mean that you are caving in or giving up. When you are flexible you are showing that you are open. Open to doing what is best for you and everyone involved! Give yourself credit from being flexible, humble, and a great human being. We all have those moments where we feel stressed out and uptight as times and little worried and being afraid of life. However, there moments that we get pass those obstacles and find happiness in knowing we tried! Live your best life! Be kind to yourself! Embrace everyone moment and experience! The best is yet to come! Blessing to you and your family!"

175976245,"Hi WearyRA, Your post is just heartbreaking. I have read your messages and I know how horrible your last few years have been. All of life has a way of just beating us down. I think us older folks seem to know this much better than the younger generation. When we are younger we have more fight in us and are able to bounce back quicker. I know for myself I just don't have that ability any longer. Losing a child is such a terrible loss. It is unnatural for a parent to outlive their child. I grieve for you. I will certainly say a prayer for you. As for your new job--I know starting anything new is hard. I have gone through this many times myself. I have had sleepless nights before just changing locations within the same company. Those of us who suffer anxiety know how hard new things can be. It also sounds as if the person who is training you really is not interested in doing this. People can be so mean and unhelpful. I know this will be hard but please try to relax. I know its easier said than done. I 
am retired and so thankful I don't have to deal with stressful work and people who are only out to make themselves look better at the expense of others. Lastly I know how you feel about taking your meds namely Xanax. I used to be the same way about my pain meds. I didn't want to become addicted. I hated the _USER_ID_ attached to taking opiates. My own family would look down on me. In the end I took the meds and they have helped me so much. I will continue to take whatever will help me cope with life and take my chronic pain away. We are the ones living in our bodies. Please do what will make you feel better about yourself. My prayers and thoughts are with you. Bless you."
175976246,"My mom asked if I'm OK again and I have a very depressive tone of voice when I speak. I told her that I feel depressed and she said that it's good that I told her. I said that I keep thinking about what the video chat people said last year and she said ""What did they say?"" and I said ""They said that I'm lost and need to find one thing to live and die for which is stupid"" so she said ""Well yeah everyone has a passion"", I then said ""I don't have any passion that I can articulate"".. She said that ""Medicine is it"" and I ""Have a lot of knowledge about it"".. I suppose that's true. I said to her that I want to go to school - But COVID so I can do courses online for now.. I just didn't know what to do.. I need to put more faith into myself and trust my own thoughts. A lot of my thoughts aren't even mine - They're intrusive and the opposite of what I think - Just really annoying thoughts that bug me and test me and stir up ****."

175976249,"Yes. The fact that the SPD person has lived for years ""in the grey"" proves to the BPD that excessive BPD emotion is unnecessary to survival . I at least became BPD thanks to having grown up in an emotional war zone, and treasure the example set by my SPD friend--minimal, rational, and personal, utterly disregarding of ""what other people think"". By definition, the personality-disordered are all deeply unconscious of something . However, in general, SPDs seem hyper-conscious, and BPDs utterly unconscious. SPDs somewhat rigid, and BPDs spontaneous, if not unhinged xD"

And ""Not only is there all that, but the IBS (net says Intestinal Bowel Syndrome) is so bad that I feel absolutely horrific and of course terrified it could be something more serious.""

175976282,"My therapist lent it to me. Like most interactive/self-help books, it is not applicable to the way I think or live. I have to translate. But there are occasional nuggets of unintentional wisdom that I have been transcribing into a tiny notebook. Separated from their original context, they hold more weight, as the book is set up like a 12-step program. At the author's suggestion, I have replaced ""higher power"" with something more tangible, however I have been having difficulty inserting phrases like ""fried beef _USER_ID_"" or ""small, overly clingy carnivorous mammal"" into most sentences. FAQ? Fart Atop Queen? Facinorous Armed Queer? It used to be easy. Now it's nerve-wracking. I'm thinking about utilizing ambient temperature: impossible to paint in the winter as it's so cold in here the paper never dries. When my apartment reaches my comfort level, say 90º, it may get interesting. I've been wanting to do more abstract ideas, but that's taking a lot of trial and error. Most of the time it ends 
up looking like a used placemat. There probably is. Some kind of dissociation. I just call it zoning out. It's like a bad habit. The more you allow it to happen, the more it sneaks up on you. I paste notes to myself all over the apartment that say things like ""Be Present!"" ""Cognize!"" https://youtu.be/FxZUrWkWZpE?t=2982 #toolate As someone who experienced what I call minimal parenting (this extended to material items as well: ""Mom, buy me this record?"" ""Why don't you just use your tape recorder and record it off the radio?"") I never understood material minimalism. I like stuff. I want stuff. I pilfer small, useless items from my clients (""whoa. these people have too many steak knives. I'll fix that!"") At last we disagree: hoarded ideas and plans (read: goals) keep me going and assures me that the future is more than an inevitable void. btw, from where I stand, your contributions here have been frequently constructive and always enjoyable. True, but I myself am comfortable with the illusion of legacy.

So if the Melatonin is not working by itself, _NAME_ is saying he adds 900 mg of Valerian Root, also at the health food store, or these days, over the net. My psychiatrist doesn't like health food items for they haven't been tested. But when I saw her last week, she had little clue about what doctor medicine I could take for sleep, and the two she suggested, I had either tried before and it didn't work, or I tried a new one she suggested, and that one didn't work, either. Also, by itself, I'm not sure Melatonin or Valerian Root would work for me. As a bipolar, I take Lilthium and Mirtazapine. Without those base medicines to calm me down, health food pills don't work for me. Sleep problems can be a sign of more complex issues and checking with a psychiatrist might be best. It was for me."

Being addicted to porn has nothing to do with if you love your wife or not. If you've been watching porn since you were 12....that is a numbing issue. This can be corrected. You and your wife should have a conversation and then you or both of you should seek help. This could be fun for both of you. If you and your wife can be open-minded. Stay safe and be well."

I’m using my low quality paper too, only 25% cotton. Layering is hard with this one and it doesn’t really absorb the water but it’s enough for practicing. I’m trying this new watercolor paint that _NAME_’s mom sent me. It’s a really good paint."

175976345,Where is everyone on this lovely Saturday? I'm trying to study but it's hard to focus. I feel great but unfocused. Maybe a little tired. I think that's the abilify making me kind of sleepy. Trying to bring me down! Uggggghhh. I'm hungry but I don't really want to eat more I ate some pork for lunch. I shouldn't snack. Maybe I'll have some alcohol later hahaha. I just want to talk talk talk but I don't know what to talk about I'm afraid I'm annoying everyone I know. Other friends are all busy and don't want to talk. I don't want to bother my mother she's watching a movie. My sister is playing a game. Talk talk talk.

I feel super awake and hyper aware again. My mom took away my seroquel I had left over so I can’t even take that as extra to help me fall asleep. I don’t know how long it’ll take for me to calm down. Hopefully this long weekend I can channel my energy into studying.

I also started taking probiotics! Seems to be getting better. Beano sounds good too but its easier to stay away from beans :D... I did consider s’thicone, i will try that if all else fails. But i do realise is walking for 30mins after a meal seems to lower alot of gastro issues. Awful, tryna lose weight eating greens and getting bloatedness as a side effect"

175976361,How am I supposed start considering my own feelings? I've gone over 30 years putting everyone else first. When I'm left alone with just my feelings it's like I just shut off so I don't need to feel them. How am I supposed let go of caring about other's feelings before my own?

I always feel bad when I do. It is not healthy food either. I keep telling myself that I am not hungry and I walk away from eating, but then a little while later I am eating. I want to loose weight, so that when I get my colostomy reversed it will be easier for the surgeon to perform the surgery and it will help with my hernia if I do. It is just so hard to stop eating."

175976370,"Loners isolate by choice. Schizoids isolate because not to do so would cause stress and discomfort. These people are either sociopathic or psychotic. The news media carelessly applies the 'loner' term because they seem to be conditioned to. Headlines and news bites must be simple and brief. Pulling off a mass shooting would probably entail too much social interaction/exposure for a schizoid to bother. Mostly disinterest, although that disinterest is a camouflage for anxiety. Perhaps feeling disinterest is a way to avoid that anxiety. Also, social interaction involves a good deal of give-and-take. By give, I mean sharing of and exposing myself to others. I prefer to keep my secrets to myself, and by secrets, I mean just about anything I am thinking/feeling. By sharing, I risk contaminating my inner world with the ugly banality of the outside world. Also, getting back to disinterest, I find most people aren't worthy of hearing what I have to say or think. I feel no need to disclose anything about mys
elf to someone I have no interest in communicating with, ever. Yet when I meet people who I find interesting or worthy of my interest, it's still not easy to share with them. It's like intense shyness but without self-doubt or fear."

175976374,"Hi, I thought depression was more having suicide thoughts and bursting into tears a lot. I’ve been unmotivated for years. And not feeling like getting out of bed in the morning is just from my sleep apnea. I read a Facebook post that said that depression was not having the motivation to do anything. I thought that was just laziness. I was bullied my mean women at my part time job for over 6 months. It was constant indirect harassment. I left and the one woman stalked me to the other job. She trashed me to all the surrounding businesses. People I didn’t even know were talking about me. She posted something about me on the internet which I don’t even know how to find. Everyone always says don’t let them get to you, but how? I have no privacy or anonymity because of these women. I walk around stores doing errands and people burst out into laughter and say did you see that facebook post? And proceed to tell them about it. It’s frustrating because i did nothing to these people and they believe 
everything they read or hear like it’s gospel. I have to find another part time or full time job but it feels like this will keep happening to me everywhere i go. My self esteem is very low right now. I’m not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m too pessimistic for my own good. Ttyl, S2bs"

On one hand I want to study math and computers and data and like make an equation that disproves god or something. Then there’s part of me that thinks about finance and business. I’m all over the place sometimes with my thinking. I want to do it all. I want to learn EVERYTHING.

175976388,"_AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_, I think that you are both right, and if I add your answers, I could solve the problem... thanks! On one hand, it's true that I don't trust my intuition enough, and that I should increase my self-esteem about social exchanges; on the other hand, objectively I need to know others' feelings and emotional needs, if I wish to bound. I can agree or disagree with their pov, but their sensitivity and way of being deserve respect - and if I wish their friendship, I esteem them. If they need more tact, privacy, or disinhibition,.. there isn't an objective meter for these things. It's not binary: I am wrong, or you are wrong. All that suggests me this solution: I shouldn't pose my question as a doubt about myself (indirectly calling for criticism), but as a clarification about one's needs and feelings! Instead of: “was I inopportune?”, I could ask: “would you need more privacy in these situations?”. It could work: people wouldn't fear to hurt me and would answer sincerel
y. I would have my feedback, and the exchange would increase my self- esteem in dealing with people and situations, without a self-destructive attitude."

175976398,"I have no idea, but I am trying! I make sure to always have music or TV playing, even if it is just in the background. Little distractions. Books, coloring books, video games, puzzles, cute animal videos online, anything that gets your mind off things, even for a moment. I find that meditation exercises are harder lately because my mind wanders into panic. I've been finding that distraction is the key. Maybe talking or reaching out to others however you can, even through this isolation period. If you want to chat, let me know."
174370050,"I hear you about motivation and learning philosophy. You might like Boethius who wrote a book called The Consolation of Philosophy. It's old school though. Maybe you could do what I do and have a job where you can listen to audiobooks, podcasts, lectures, and songs while at work. Something that keeps your body busy, but like in a meditative state of mind where you can listen well. It's the environment where I listened to upward of up a thousand lectures, way better than a university lecture, although, philosophy in the classroom taught me how to writer better. Having a job for me has brought structure to my life that I found I needed. It forces me to get up in the morning and feel the pull to be productive so that I can pay rent, car repairs (which are the WORST), and pay for food. My roommates brother now lives with us and he has a phd but he wont work, he sounds mentally healthy and lucid. Are you able to feel negative emotions like when you feel like you've let someone down? When I emotionally c
ompletely flat I didn't give a **** about work, I had to fight for my negative emotions so that I could get the anxiety to get up in the morning to help my boss and co workers. My boss is cool to let me have a few beers at lunch, it's the only thing that allows me to feel any positive emotion, although, Seroquel greatly diminished that to next to nothing, but alcohol still helps. I know it's horrible to say that... I only drink at lunch, and when I write, but that's what an alcoholic would say, sooo… I guess of the shoe fits. I don't drink in the morning or evening though. If you need a lecture, podcast, or book recommendation @ me and I'll point you to aa direction, brother. You're family man."

175976402,Hi everyone..happy thanksgiving. Here I am home with what was a chest cold confirmed with an X-ray that it’s pneumonia My anxiety is through the roof and I’m driving myself crazy. Trying to relax and know the antibiotic will do it’s job I’m healthy and young and will be fine. But becauSe my heart rate skyrockets at the drs (130bpm) the urgent care was worried about a blood clot even though the high pulse was my only risk factor which immediately goes down once I leave the doctor or urgent care. Thankfully my actual pcp is aware of my jump when I’m there and knows I monitor it ( more than I should I’m sure) and my normal is always under 100 tends to be around 80s when I’m not thinking about it and up of course some when I am. Hoping this passes soon so I can feel normal again _NAME_

175976405,"Hello, I've noticed over the past month that I have had a hard time texting friends back. I have never had social anxiety when it comes to hanging out with people face-to-face but since being quarantined the thought of keeping up with friends solely through texting and social media is overwhelming. I don't feel too nervous or anxious, just completely drained and exhausted. My friends and family have noticed that I am much less communicative with them. I do not know if this is just me being lazy because I've never been great at texting people back or something else. When I think of how long I've ignored some of my friends texts I feel very guilty but it is just soo hard for me to think of texting/communicating with them. I know to them it must seem like I'm just withdrawing out of the blue and I don't know why I've been feeling this way. Any thoughts?"

He may even think nothing is wrong with him.. which produces hallucinations.. (Idk).. If he has never hallucinated, I would have suggested psilocybin. People can be agitated for many reasons. You won't be able to know the reasons. Saying ""(F)uck you God"" is like saying idk he made a bad choice with his phd.. could be in debt.. can't get a job he likes.. a gf.. hates his life basically.

175976414,"Hey everyone,I hope you all are safe and well. Im a 21yo female living in NYC. NYC was hit the hardest in the entire country with coronavirus. So you can imagine what happened to people with anxiety. When COVID hit, we went into lockdown and I had multiple panic attacks. And I've never had panic attacks that intense ever in my life. Those attacks happened in March sine then i've been trying to cope with my emotions and physical symptoms. I have pains and its been 3-4 months now. Since the severe lung , chest, shoulder/shoulder blades/back area pain. The pain lasted for hours at end with maybe an hour of relief. The pain has decreased now. But naproxen, Motrin, and Tylenol dont do much. Everyone thinks it's anxiety related. But can anxiety pain last hours on ends ( basically 24 hours and for 3 months). I had 2 chest x-rays, a breast ultrasound, an EGD with biopsy, 3 EKGs , complete and thorough blood work, urine test. Every single thing has come back as normal. I had experienced insane jaw , ear, an
d throat pain and went to the ENT. He looked in my ears, looked in the throat, even up my nose with a camera and it was all normal. (He diagnosed me with TMJ because this pain started before the COVID crisis). Even now i'll get heart pain. I'll be watching TV and the pain will catch me by surprise. In my lungs in my chest in my back. I'll catch myself feeling breathless. I get nervous. My pain in my lungs is like a burning, electric-like sharp sizzling pain. They say lung cancer at 21 is rare. But because its rare doesnt mean its not out there. I dont smoke. But its still a possibility. Should I get CT scans done?"

175976434,So I’ve been connecting with people on LinkedIn from within different positions of the company I work at. A lot of people in Vice President or Director roles and a lot in data analysis roles. I found the Director of Data Science and messaged her asking her for any advice she might have in getting into a career of data processing. Gah! So nervous but I did it. I hope she responds and doesn’t just think I’m a crazy person.
175976435,Tomorrow I'll have to see if they'll let me pay for my cell service out of my money account. A relative called the home this morning but no one knows my cell service is suspended. I don't want to lose my phone number. I slept all day because it was too much work to be awake. I hope I don't get stomach flu again. At least one CNA saw me about to take a hit off a disposable today. It's the weird CNA. I hope she doesn't blackmail me. I'm more worried about whether the older CNA saw me holding and hiding my disposable when she appeared at the foot of my bed. I wish my friend would try to get in contact with me. If he lost his phone he's probably really depressed.

174370129,"Wishy-washy. I have none of the light green traits (or maybe ""half"" of one of those), most of the dark green ones, and most of the brown ones. I don't live what people would usually call ""a normal life"" (well... except for these days, when my lifestyle is the norm ) and I'm only very marginally integrated in society. But I'm able to live independently, I'm content with my life, and I consider myself lucky even on bad days (because I know bad days are temporary). I'm yet to hear of someone with AvPD who would say the same. To be fair, I guess the word ""severity"" is very often used to mean ""degree of inability to integrate into society"". But that's because psychology in practice tends to be more concerned with making people ""productive"" rather than ""happy"". Those two things don't always align. So that usage of the word is deceptive. Yes, and I think that's what's most wishy-washy about it. SPD can be seen as ""in between"" AvPD and StPD in many ways, yes, but that's just because the conce
pt of SPD in itself is wishy-washy, so it ends up applying to different things that only look similar. AvPD and StPD aren't degrees of the same thing. StPD is very literally a less severe variant of schizophrenia. It can be complicated or alleviated by someone's upbringing or life circumstances, but it's highly genetic."

I don't think _PERSON_ is going to ban flavors or vaping. What I notice about him is that he will jump into or out of something without knowing the facts. I don't think he knew anything about vaping when he announced a flavor ban in September. I think the number of jobs that would be lost might be changing his mind. And finally, the knowledge that it was contaminated THC that is responsible for the lung injuries and deaths. The CDC dithered a lot and kept it ambiguous as long as they could. The American Heart association is showing me commercials that are beyond anti vaping. I was shocked. The info about vaping is easy to find, and I don't know if this is deliberate or misguided on their part. The governor of NY knows that vaping is less harmful but said ""so what?"" When he announced their flavor ban. They are so dishonest, all because they're losing

175976460,"Greetings folks. I used to post in another depression forum under the same _NAME_ but for some reason, find myself wading in unchartered territory now... Just a little history about me and my wife... My wife and I were first married in 2008. Then in around 2015, a church counsellor diagnosed her with depression(that made me sign up at a depression forum to know more) and also around the same time, she abandoned me. It was a whirlwind few months and before I knew it, my wife filed for divorce. At that time, I was unaware about her mental illness and thought she no longer loved me, so I agreed to it... : _ ( Many months later, while I was away at Army Reservist, she called me out of the blue, saying that she had been warded at IMH (Institute of Mental Health, in Singapore) for 30 days and had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. That was how everything started to make sense. To cut the long story short, we reconciled and remarried in 2017. She was formerly on Olanzopin and Valproate (mood stabiliser 
I think), but due to her concerns with her weight gain, we discussed with the IMH doctor and the Olanzopin was slowly reduced to 0. And she managed fine with just the Valproate for at least almost a year. A few days ago (and over the course of a few days developing), she started to have mood changes, being suddenly energetic, suddenly lethargic, having impaired judgment, hearing voices, not sleeping at all for a few days, grand ideas about getting a new place and applying for new jobs, not being able to focus (blank stare), withdrawing from me and our activities totally, fingers twitching every few seconds, suddenly bursting into tears, irrational fear of dust mites and seeing black shadows in the room. PHEW I think that's about it. So again to cut the long story short, she abandoned me (again) 2 mornings ago at around 8am and I panicked a little when I found out after waking up. Went to NEX Shopping Mall to search for her all over as she said the night before that she would be there at McDonald's. Couldn't f
ind her there or anywhere. Called IMH A&E and IMH Crisis Hotline to enquire for advice. Received it. So yesterday, after she DID NOT return home, I filed a 'missing person' report at the police station. I'm now waiting and hoping for her mania or hypomania or depression to end and return home...so that I can quickly call for the ambulance and send her straight to IMH for assessment. I'm worried and anxious about a few things...namely her safety and well-being and longer-term, her perhaps filing for divorce again months down the road. : _ ( I love my wife a lot and unconditionally. She's my soul-mate and the love of my life. I'm a Christian and have faith in God, so I keep referring to this verse: ""4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, alway
s perseveres. 8 Love never fails."" Some people (like my mother) have asked me to give up and move on but I vehemently refuse. It's very selfish thinking. I will love my wife till the day I die, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health. If there is any man or woman out there in my predicament, take heart in the knowledge that you are not alone and I am struggling alongside you. I've read myriad posts about how so many caregivers want to give up, or file for divorce, or say that it will keep happening again and again so better bail out quickly. Well, I know what I'm in for but "" I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"". This may sound obscure or absurd to non-Christians but it's part of what keeps me going...I'm sure you, the reader, have your own coping mechanism... I would like to hear any opinions or suggestions you have regarding my predicament. And please do not put me down and ask me to give up...if you have to do so, please try to do it in a constructive way; thanks very much a
nd I truly appreciate all your insights... Some questions: 1. How often does your Bipolar spouse return after leaving? How long does his/her mania state last? 2. Should I stop contacting her totally, or continue to sporadically message her once or twice a day (which I have been doing). I don't want to pressure her too much, and yet I want her to know that I'm there for her. 3. Do you feel like life is less stressful now that they have moved away, but feel guilty about it? 4. What do you do to take care of yourself while waiting interminably...? 5. If in the event she files for divorce again, what can I do to delay it this time? Or please feel free to share any insights or experiences; thanks! _PERSON_ from Singapore. Post Edited (_PERSON_) : 5/21/2019 12:55:31 PM (GMT-6)"

175976464,"I don't think it is not having the nerve to ask for help. For me anyway, I'm in severe and desperate need of hope. Just a little hope so we may live to see the day when people realize how incredibly painful that people with bpd lives are!( Maybe more therapist will embrace how unique we are. And help us find our way thru this dark place. They will realize not all people with bpd are manipulative and take anger out on others. I have the bpd gift of being an empath. I feel what others feel, always praying I can take it from them. I can also notice the tiniest change in a persons mood, and many times, before they feel it. I have a chat friend, and she trips out when I know how she is feeling. These gifts may have helped someone in need. I don't think I'll live to see that day."

I’m not sure what this void is, and why I’m missing anything. I used to be that person that thought about good past times, but now I’m someone who ignores my past and only thinks about the future. “If only I had this or could do this, it’d make me so happy”. I had a list of things I wrote down like that, that I found today from 2018. I have half or more than half the stuff I wrote down. Or accomplished. And I still feel a void. Ugh.

175976480,"Hello all. I am desperate to seek answers any where I can as I’ve been racking my brain for a really long time wondering if it’s possible that some people with depression and anxiety just can’t be fixed. When I was a teenager I suffered horrible depression out of no where. I ended up in and out of mental hospitals. Definitely the worst years of my life. I finally found the right mix of medications and was in a really good point in my life and I never looked back. Fast forward to a few years ago my depression hit me out of nowhere again and my life is falling apart and it just seems to keep getting worse. I’m a migraine sufferer as well with no relief so I live in constant pain every day. I know that plays a huge role. I constantly don’t feel good my anxiety never leaves. I wanted more than anything to be a mother I struggled for two years and finally got the most beautiful daughter and now I can’t even take care of myself let alone her. I feel like such a failure. I’ve tried every med
ication for depression and anxiety there is out there and I’ve had no luck. Ones that have helped in the past just don’t work for me anymore. I do keep trying new ones but the Side effects are brutal and the withdrawals are even worse I feel like a lab rat I don’t wanna try anymore just to see if it’s gonna make me feel worse or not. I do believe in my heart of hearts that some people just can’t be helped that they have a chemical imbalance and no medication can fix that. I keep telling my husband and my family I can’t live like this anymore it’s not that I don’t want to be alive it’s that living in constant agony every day is not living i’m just existing. I have a psychiatrist and a therapist and they seem to be of no help. Doctors constantly tell me because I’m such a tough case they don’t know what else to do for me and give up so I don’t know why I should have hope if they don’t have hope for me. I just wanna feel better again and live a normal life. I’m not sure if thats pos
sible anymore. I feel alone, so scared and so helpless. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I want so desperately to feel better again."
175976481,Also I have no idea what I'm really referring to. I think I need to write my novel already.

My sister said my story telling has gotten much better, yet she didn't finish the story, and that first story was just 36 pages. I'm going to ask my editor if he has any idea about what aspects in my writing should I improve upon, and how to reach a wider audience. My friend, who is a creative writing major said I haven't sold many stories because I haven't even tried advertising, but paying to sell makes me hesitant. I am glad I didn't advertise my long story, because I made too many mistakes. Ultimately that long story was, if anything is certain, then it was a learning experience where I learned my strengths, how to format, _USER_ID_, and publish. So I am gl

I’m signed up to start supportive employment but haven’t heard anything back about that though, there’s supposed to be like a voc rehab program I go to, I’ll have to ask her what’s going on with that too. Either way I need something constructive to do with my time until I pay off my student account and start taking classes again."

Think about your personality, how much you push forward with every breath. Most people aren’t like that and it doesn’t matter if you’re temporarily taking a break from pushing I know you’ll do it again. You’re also fun to be around, highly exploratory. And you’re nice, I’ve never seen you be mean except in self defense. Accomplishments per se, well I don’t value them as much as other do but you’re an established mental health writer, your art was displayed and written up in the paper. You’ve got a book out and are working on a second. Just because you did it last year doesn’t make it less, it’s still part of who you are...."

Now, I know that would not be easy....it would mean that you have to walk away...going to a woman's shelter, where you can be helped, in order to get into that new life I mentioned. You would not tell him you are leaving...you just go, because if you tell him you are leaving then he may hurt you, and you have had enough of that. Can you do it? If you do.....ALL THINGS WILL CHANGE, but if you are not willing to take that step, then you have to continue to live as you are. Yes my dear...it is time to go, but not time to leave this world.....but rather....it is time to leave where you are and who you are with.

But I can’t restrict while taking metformin (I’m on it to help with antipsychotic weight, not diabetes) but still if I don’t eat enough while on it I get sick cause my blood sugar probably gets too low. Anyway I lost 15 lbs on it but it just doesn’t feel like enough. Idk. I’m 5ft 4 and 148lbs so still technically a tiny bit overweight. I want to get back to 130lbs. Idk what I’m writing this for.

175976522,"SP, this is a really good question. I think right now in my life, I'm about a 3 on the continuum. I think meds and specifically the med combination that I am on has helped me enormously. I mean like three months ago I was in the psych ward and now with med dosages changed and another med added, I'm like actually happy sometimes. I mean, not today, but sometimes. That's HUGE! But I also think that therapy and coping skills, and for lack of a better term life support has been very helpful to me, so I can't say I'm a 2 or a 1 because I think these things come into play also. And I think getting the right diagnosis or what I feel is the right diagnosis. It's like now things make sense to me and I make sense in the world. If that makes sense. Maybe I'm spouting delusional nonsense."

I don’t want to tell my other friends though or my parents about my depression/anxiety Bc I don’t want to be put on the spot if they make a big deal out of it and I’m too shy/anxious to have to go to the doctor about it. Having my best friend there for me has helped but she’s encouraging me to talk to someone _PERSON_ she can’t handle it all herself if she’s the only one I can talk to. I can’t pay for therapy Bc then my parents would know, but I found this site the other day, and you might consider therapy if possible. Also to take deep breaths and try to find someone to confide in about it, it can really help I’ve felt much better since I talked to her a few weeks ago, as I’m able to vent and lash out at her and ask for help without her getting mad and sometimes ignoring me like some of my friends."

175976530,"Omelets are super easy to make, you start by mixing up your egg in a bowl like you do for scrambled eggs, add your veggies, and meats to it in small pieces, and pour it into a small skillet with plenty of butter melting in the pan. (you can use any size skillet though!). Let it cook for just a minute or two and then, add cheese to one side. Use a spatula to fold the non cheese side over the cheese side. It should look like any folded circle. Be careful how much longer you cook it. Cook until the inside is less runny. Then slide it into your plate or bowl! You can sprinkle it with parmesan cheese, or anything else you like."

175976533,"Try looking into guided meditation through DBT by creator _PERSON_. It can be quite difficult to give it a try on your own at home but if you ever want to give it a try, just be open to asking someone for some help! It’s hard to understand the way post can affect most aspects of pro life without feeling horrible about yourself as if you’re not loving them hard enough, as if you don’t meet a care level for yourself as it is that gets totally neglected despite being so desperate to be heard and loved for who you are and who you want them to see you for and appreciate as is without trying to change, but these sort of thoughts are more or less ways of taking the term of apathy and becoming a lot more disconnected than one may even realize themselves capable of being so off balance from their normal state. Sometimes apathy is ok for a person to feel, DBT can really help teaching you that acceptance of others isn’t what’s required of you to change, and to some level, it’s quite unfair because 
it asks us to always be a better person and sometimes it might appear to us through our own perspective that the people we see causing us resentment; apathetic isolation spatial enforcement; obsession or compulsion; racing thoughts; incorrect or correct awareness for what it doesn’t allow radical acceptance to take place; these are just a few things that can be truly unfair to people in all walks of life. I truly advocate for the schools in Canada that have progressed to include dbt into early childhood education because it is prepping our world’s future with more emotionally equipped adults to handle the problems we leave our next few generations after us to fix. I hope this might help, also, another thing that really helpsAwife is honesty and open mindedness and willingness to change your understanding to what she is trying to say when she keeps telling you to open the door not run and hide you silly bean."

175976535,"I am not giving you this advice, but channeling it from other sources. So I don't know if it works or not. Here goes. You schedule an hour a day to think and feel your worst. You put everything into that hour. At the end of it, you don't allow any more of those thoughts to enter. If they do, you stop them in their tracks and tell yourself, I am not allowed to think about this anymore today. It'll have to wait until tomorrow. When I think of this advice, I can come up with many reasons it wouldn't work. But I have this image from the _NAME_ books where they can remove a strand of memory from their minds with their wands. So perhaps when the thoughts come, you remove it with an imagined wand and repeat, no more for today. Anyway, see if this works for you, along with advice you get from others!"
175976536,"bambola, I have been going through severe anxiety and I can tell you that I have a spot in the middle of the chest that hurts at times when anxiety starts. (I've also had a series of heart tests to rule out heart problems.) The doctor told me muscles will get tight or stiffen up because of anxiety and that's the pain I feel. Now that I know this it helps me feel better. It's a long road though, I know. I realize that when I'm in that anxious state I tend to think of the worst so I don't believe the tests. It's good to have an outlet to vent and relate how you feel. It's safe here because most people understand what you're going through. I find that if I can get myself involved in other things, outside or with other activities I won't dwell on this and that helps me. How are you doing now?"

Honestly, the first session is just paperwork and a ton of questions from her to get on record. If I tried to interject issues, she listened but breezed past them. It's a waste of my time because I got NOTHING out of it. I know it has to be this way for them to understand you and your issues but why do I have to pay over $200 for this? Therapy is so expensive and I don't even know if she is a fit for me at this point and if not, I will have to do this all over again with someone else. She has one more chance for me to see if this is going to work or I will move on. She seemed rather deadpanned to me and not warm and fuzzy like I would prefer."

Over the past few years i've been writing a narrative with philosophy inside, the core of it being about Greek thought. I finished it, then I got some valuable criticism, but I've spent the last couple of weeks fine tuning it. I think stoicism is a good approach to combating the external world and one's inner demons. It worked for awhile for myself, but after a year I couldn't fight any longer. As for high functioning, I've been able to hold a job with major difficulties. It's a physical job so I don't need to show up and give fake smiles to a hundred strangers a day which helps. Sleep and lack of emotions are my two biggest obstacles.

175976605,Hugs bluebird...I hope it’s just the GERD and you get it fixed.
175976606,I presented with anxiety racing thoughts not sleeping irritability and had tried antidepressant which got me very agitated like wanting to fight for no reason I feel better yet don't know if I'm just hopeful to get better I'm sleeping slightly better yet not good
175976607,I can’t smoke that stuff. I get severe paranoia and hallucinations. Idk why. My anxiety gets so bad. As if it wasn’t bad enough. I’ve tried a handful of times in my life and it was never ever good CBD flower on the other hand is just fine but I don’t do that anymore. Idk just don’t want to.
175976608,"Gonna have a cold shower and then the strong coffee with kick in and mix with dextroamphetamine I had low tolerance for pain yesterday and couldn't do it - _PERSON_ weak, shaking.. (When I get my injection I feel the needle so much more but when I have a high tolerance for pain, I can take cold showers and don't feel the needle).."
175976609,"If it causes anxiety and the normal grooming does not work, it can. I am not really familiar with the concept. It would be part of it, but there is another way to look at it. Its just that people have a pre-moral filter, that filter out things automatically from consciousness, and I say moral in a very general way, but oddities are filtered out from people's consciousness automatically. If you don't have that filter, you deal with more information, so may come to different conclusions. Some things simply have to be denied in order to function in society, even if it is right there in front of you. And that is often where conspiracy theories start, an odd thing that cannot be explained in the appropriate narrative. So taking that thing into account would be inappropriate. That goes also for inappropriate connections. Just taking one example of aliens. it is a word used in normal speech to describe some people, but is also used in sci-fi. Mixing up the two would be inappropriate, yet this is what can 
happen, and writers do that often. People don't have a problem with it if it is in a kind of religious setting, like watching a movie, but outside of that setting, it is inappropriate. So people get confused, and end up having to reject one of the meaning, and they choose whatever fits them better. Psychiatrists tend to reject the normal meaning, normal people would tend towards the opposite. I think there is more to it than that, from what I read. Otherwise, it would only be logical mistakes that could be solved easily through cognitive therapy. Besides, people make those type of mistakes all the time, and it is not a problem, as long as it is an accepted mistake in the subculture. That is why there is a moral thing going on here. Part of it is also to think in stereotypes, which again are inappropriate in most circumstances, unless hidden or obfuscated and padded and flowered in poetry so people are not sure of the meaning. Again, it is a moral thing, which the greys will denounce as lacking in nuances. Rig
ht, that is how it will show. It can be done voluntarily. If you loose control or go too far, it can look like word salad, and can be as well if you loose logic entirely. Like if there is too much information or emotions, it can be impossible to tie up entirely and freeze for primate consumption. Its part of it, and yes, it is a bit like we are doing. And yes, I let myself go more than I would usually, since you seem perceptive. Its like a starving polar bear out of water. I don't mind, it has to be done sometimes, to save humanity. Its part of it. That's also true. There's a balance somewhere that is not easy to achieve."
175976610,"So glad you have a therapist... and so glad you are opening up on here...it helps to write it out and realize what you wrote. Important unloading.. good job! Keep going.... btw, I think we all have attachment and abandonment issues.... childhood wounds, parents, close caregivers... there are hickups everywhere. I thought for the longest I was very secure in my attachment but realize that I had trauma too and I’m having a hard time letting go... even if I should and it would be better for me... not that easy. But much talk therapy helps... for sure. Keep going. And journaling helps too. Once you start writing you won’t stop..., it ll be a flow of events and emotions unloading.... very healing. ?"

175976621,"A couple months back I was numb and angry. I found a self help book ""feeling Good, the new mood therapy"" by _NAME_. I started reading about my self-defeating thoughts. How often I told my self: there is no point in doing anything. I don't have the energy. I am bored, tired, i have no life. Or self defeating action: I'll just stay in bed or on the sofa, avoid activities or people. I know with cov-19 we can't minge much. These type of thoughts just make you feel worse. Count the times you say these things to yourself per day. Recognize you are having these type of thought. Catch yourself and tell yourself something good about your life or make some plans, start a new hobbie. Organize your closet, what would you want to do when we all get out of quarantine. Keep your thoughts on the positive and it can help with depression. It did me. Good luck!"

175976629,I have to admit something. I stopped taking my seroquel almost a week ago. I couldn’t stand it. It made me so groggy in the morning. It was taking me four cups of coffee to feel awake. I feel like people are watching me at the gym. Eyes watching me. I felt almost like I was getting messages in music today. Almost there. I can’t take it. I can’t. I really can’t stand to take it.

175976644,"Doing the unthinkable, drinking decaf coffee"
175976645,"Long post ahead but I'm lost and don't know what to do. I've been dealing with chronic insomnia for decades. As I get older (just turned 58), the insomnia has really become unbearable. On a good night, I get maybe four or five hours of sleep and I can function pretty well throughout the day. But there are many bad nights when I get little to NO sleep at all. The days following those nights are unbearable. So about six months ago, I convinced my PCM to let me try some sleeping pills. I was prescribed with Lunexa - 3mg, daily. But as is well known, the Lunexa worked fine initially but as my tolerance to the drug built up my insomnia returned. Lately, there have been nights when I've taken 3, 4 or even 6mg of Lunexa and it had no effect on me. The lack of sleep has made me a very unhappy person to be around. I snap at the slightest things. One recent event: I took a trip to New _USER_ID_ to visit friends in a cancer support group I belong to. When I got to my destination, I went to the car rental coun
ter where I had reserved a car. When I got to the counter, there was no car. Although the guy behind the counter tried to help, I went ballistic. I was screaming and yelling, I was making a scene, etc. My wife was scared, she thought I was going to get arrested. I've always had a 'bad temper' but this was a nightmare. Reflecting on it now, I can't believe I was like that. So almost two weeks ago, I stopped the taking the Lunexa and I went back to see my doctor looking for help. The Lunesta was no longer working and my insomnia was taking a toll not only on me, but those around me. After filling out questionnaires asking me my medical history and talking with the doc for a bit, the doctor felt I had the classic signs of mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Accordingly, I've been prescribed bupropion, 150 mg each morning, along with 100mg of trazodone, which I am to take each night to help me sleep. In addition to the trazodone at bedtime, I am also taking 1.5mg of melatonin ('Midnite' sleep aid, a
lso contains lemon balm, chamomile and lavender) as well as some CBD tincture that I picked up at my local dispensary (one eye-dropper full under the tongue at bedtime). You would think with the trazodone, melatonin, and CBD tincture that I should easily fall asleep when i head to bed at 10:00 p.m. each night. But, nope, I rarely even feel drowsy. I cannot understand how nothing seems to help. I've been using an app on my phone to track my sleep. Here's what I've been dealing with for the past week: Nov 9 - 3 hours of sleep Nov 10 - 4 hours of sleep Nov 11 - 4.5 hours of sleep Nov 12 - 40 minutes of sleep Nov 13 - 4.5 hours of sleep Nov 14 - 2 hours of sleep I am unable to concentrate or focus at work. I'm a software engineer / computer programmer by trade so this is not good. Additionally, I have to drive to the office two days a week, 1.5 hours each way. Today while driving to work, I felt uncomfortable and unsafe. I'm worried that I'm going to get into an accident and hurt myself or others. I don't know wh
at to do. I know these drugs can take several weeks in order to start working but shouldn't I feel at least something by now?. I'm approaching two weeks on these drugs and so far I am not feeling any therapeutic effects. None. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. _NAME_ - Colorado Springs, CO"

My sister says that I'm the type of person that can't do drugs because they all effect me so negatively due to my mental illness."

I just stood there, they gave me dishes, I washed them a little and then put them in the dish spray washer and put them in the kitchen. I cut potatoes for like over an hour though for prep cooking. It felt endless. Like there was so many damn potatoes. I wasn't thinking much while doing this. The only thoughts I had were intrusive OCD thoughts every few moments. I worked from 9am-1:30pm so 4.5 hours. I work Friday, Saturday and Sunday at these times so I'll get 12-15 hours a week. Bit of extra money right? Also it forces me to wake up early (Which was hard af.. My mom had to try and wake me up 3 times ""Take your Vyvanse right now"" - _PERSON_..).

Or what I think of abuse anyway. I cry because he just works all day and then plays video games when he comes home. He barely shows me attention. He just almost wants to be like in the same household but not doing anything together. I guess I never thought it'd be like this. I thought we'd at least do things together sometimes. But we dont. I have to beg him on his days off to do anything. I'm lucky if he does. I dont want my life to be like this forever. Especially since we've only been dating 2 years.

175976693,"Without knowing the details, I would say even if your mom appears to be trying to move on, you won't know until you sit down and talk to her and ask her how she is feeling and confess that you are still feeling plagued by guilt and unable to move on. Perhaps the conversation can help you both to move forward together or at least to come to an understanding and try to heal together. Nothing can be accomplished by silence. And in your own private time, try to forgive yourself. It's terrible when we hurt people we love even if it's accidental, but we must try to forgive ourselves. It doesn't mean the accident didn't happen or that there was no injury, of course. But in order to try to have a happy life, we cannot hold on to the hurtful things of the past. This Scripture comforts me so much when I'm feeling super guilty about past mistakes from Psalm 130:3 ""If errors were what you watch, O Jah, Then who, O Jehovah, could stand? In other words, if God only saw our mistakes and held them against us, how 
could we even go on living? But he doesn't. And if he is willing to forgive us, surely you can give yourself some grace and learn to forgive yourself. I hope you and your mother are able to find a way forward."

At least with masks on it keeps your nose and most of your face warm. It's gonna be like 22 degrees the next two days with a low of 7, supposed to snow. Happy about that. It doesn't feel like Christmas without snow here in New York. We accumulated a lot of snow the past several years but not this year, due to global warming probably. I'm hoping to finish my embroidery project by Christmas or New Years. Not exactly sure how long it will take me, I'm learning as I go. I'll be so proud of myself when I'm done. Actually, I'm already proud of myself for learning how to thread a needle and doing a basic running stitch! Other parts of it will be a little more complicated. I could see this becoming another hobby"

175976705,Wow! I’ve never tried it before but I might have to now!!!
175976706,"Yeah, my mood element largely is depressed. Last winter I was really depressed. I usually get depressed in winter. My depressed episodes outweigh my hypomanic episodes by a lot. I was originally diagnosed as having ‘psychotic depression’."

She's unwilling to try / wants to hide her behaviors and you don't want the ""additional expenses"" that would come with trying Ok I see. Makes sense. I relate to both sides of the fence - the (only sometimes for me) strain of ""providing emotional reaction"" and the need to recieve it to an extent (or some type of reassurance)."
175976714,"I wish I could do that. I have a hard time opening up in real life. I don't socialize well. My parents keep telling me, how are you going to meet a husband? You never go out...."

Going to the store tomorrow. Then to the meeting, bingo, and also cleaning the apartment, and doing laundry. Doing well on my meds."
174370465,So you don’t really want to say much about delusions at all because they aren’t logical. You definitely don’t want to say anything that would make him believe you also believe the delusions. That can make the delusions worse. As far as cancelling could be so many things...a lot of people with sz are lacking in motivation or just don’t feel good that night. A lot of people in general have anxiety in social situations which can make going out anything but relaxing. Another possibility is adhd like symptoms.....I didn’t have adhd until I got psychosis and I’m not sure if it’s from the illness or the meds. Thing is we all have a range of symptoms and none of us have the same ones due to additional illness....some people also have ocd etc....it just seems to be really common to have additional illnesses with psychosis and sz.

175976720,"Preparing for meetings is very important, clearly. I, too, had a high-pressured job, indeed career (now retired), so I spent hours reading and writing before a meeting when I was ""up."" Having said that, however, no one can possibly anticipate all the questions that may be asked or withstand a barrage of criticisms. If that's how these meetings with your boss make you feel, then that's a failure of leadership. What I hope you can do is listen respectfully to all comments and questions, breathe, and then answer to the best of your ability. And don't be afraid to say, ""I don't know, I'll have to get back to you on that."" And then remember to follow up. You are not a walking encyclopedia. Be gracious but clear in what you know and don't know. You can even pay a compliment: ""That's a good question (or insight). I'd like to think more about that and get back to you."" There's no ticking time bomb for when you need to respond. At the same time, you may indeed find yourself under more pressure than is 
good for you or working under a boss that is unrelenting and over-demanding. Sometimes it is best to know when it's time to make a change. I agree therapy is key now to help you deal with the spikes in anxiety and to perhaps take medication to help you regulate. But I hope the more you take possession of what you can and can't give on the spot, in real time, the more you'll feel in some control and therefore less anxious. I feel for you. I'm happy, after 45 years, to be out of the pressure cooker...though my retirement coincided with the pandemic. Not too great, either!"

175976724,My mom and dad are very different... My mom is supportive about the technical sides to my mental illness.. And my dad is completely out of touch - Yet he makes sense to me.. It's a scary thing. They're complete opposites. My whole family has a really good sense of humour.. I don't know how to piece all of this together...
175976725,"Hi alohaknown, Sorry to hear about what you are going through. Anxiety can be compared to a battle that takes place in the mind, and perseverance is vital. Here is a thought that you might be able to relate to and a suggestion that might help: Rather than a single, mountainous problem, it is often the accumulation of small, seemingly insignificant distresses that induces panic—much like the way running too many individual electrical appliances on the same circuit can blow a fuse. One solution is to write down each problem on an index card and arrange them from the simplest problem to the most difficult. Tackle them one at a time. Writing out your distresses changes their makeup from what you fear and avoid to what you can see and resolve. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers."
175976726,I was very very smart and happy after risperdal i never felt that
175976727,"I think sometimes as things go well in life we start getting scared that something is about to go wrong. We’re scared we are going to lose our peaceful life, the things we hold dear will disappear and thus our phobias and our disorders wake up seemingly out of nowhere. I, like you, have a wonderful family, no kids, but an amazing and supportive husband and great parents in law, brother and sister in law. It feels like everything should be good, I should be thankful for my life and yes I am thankful. But fears creep in, fear that I will lose the joy I have, that the things and people I hold so dear will get hurt or just disappear suddenly. I know, those fears are illogical at first sight. But, there is always a reason, it could be hidden. I realized I’m so dependent on my family, and they don’t mind. And if I don’t start acting more independently I feel my own character is going to get erased. I’m too vulnerable on my own, and so I started getting anxiety and depression. It is good that yo
u know what is happening to you. It’s good to catch those things before they get out of hand. My mum suffered from an awful debilitating agoraphobia. She was unable to leave the house for 2 years. But she was an old lady. You are still young, you’re strong, and I do believe you will get better. I wish the best for your family, for your kids. Don’t be scared. Phobias can be treated!"
175976728,You should be very proud.....it’s hard work to be stable....
175976729,"You might want to try an MBSR class. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. There are a number of them available online these days. It takes some effort, but can be transformative. It’s good you are aware of the need to drink less. That may help reduce the anxiety too. And it may enable the meds to work better. I like to drink too but I have learned to limit it to one or two a night."
175976730,"I receive a lot of mental health care: individual therapy, group therapy, case management, peer support and psychiatry. I have at least one appointment per week for something mental health related. But I only see my pdoc once every other month"
175976731,"One thing I've noticed a bit is that I don't want to share anything that I love with anyone. I am capable of having strong emotions and connections to things, but when other people are around it kind of ruins it -- like going to a concert from a band or a musician I really love, it's better if I go alone, and it's much better if I'm alone afterward. Experiencing things with other people is so deepy disappointing to me for some reason."

175976735,"I heard a talk on you tube that helped me during this time. It’s packed with info, almost too much... my biggest take away so far and I have to listen again, is this time we are all in on the planet is a reset button. We are at a critical time....I’m reframing, renaming many of my former definitions of things, right down to the yucky feeling I used to have in the pit of my stomach when I was dreading something. Now I’m acknowledging that it could be something very different and I ask for guidance rather than assume I’m dreading. We’re being asked to sync up to a different energy and getting information in different ways, for our evolution. I’m not sure that helps you at all. I just know finally, how much I don’t know and asking deeply what it’s about. My old self wants to categorize it and “work it” so I can get on with my full life. My new self knows 1 thing....it’s not about getting on to the old ways....and I’m listening more....observing, and reframing. That dreaded feel
ing, I’m now calling something new, and because I don’t know what it is, I’m surrendering to controlling it. Here’s to reframing......may it be more easeful on you and your system. ??"

175976761,"Glad you went for a nice walk. Can we get a repeat of that someday? Can these walks continue with your sister? I think your father in law is there not because of lack of planning, but because he sees a free place to stay. How much would he be paying in rent? If somebody told me a freeloader was living in my house for free because he was here to help, I would probably lose it. And if a freeloader told me he wanted me to work so I could replace my kitchen cabinets, well, I hope I wouldn’t say too much because it sounds like he’s hard enough to live with as it is. I do feel for you, but you’ll have to admit, you had as many complaints before he moved in as you do now. Might want to use this time to figure out why. What is going on with your overall situation? Are we feeling, like, angry, or anxiety or depression? Have you always felt in this superstate? Who do you get this from, either parent? Any siblings with this? Did you feel like this growing up? Do meds seem to help? Can you get out once a

So I have a choice - To be optimistic and use everything that I have. The problem is that I don't see my worth after being on that video chat. That one person and what he said for 10 minutes really messed me up for over a year - I think about it every day. It shouldn't bother me that bad but he got a knife, stabbed it into me and twisted it. It's now apart of my identity. I have to identify with something - That's what people do. I'm rushed as well. My mom drinks and makes drama, my dad is always away - Should have been there for me. I knew that I was being manipulated my entire life (By my mom and ex step dad) but I didn't do anything about it. I didn't question it - I just said that I was depressed and hoped that a medication could save me. I didn't question my overly strict catholic school - I just went along with the torture. I could have done somethi

I have a lot of work on me that needs to be done. ""I don't know how long I'll live"" - Thoughts like that plague me every day because of anxiety. I know what I want to do but I haven't articulated or expressed it. I'm scared of my future and haunted by the past - Like everyone else. I don't think that anything that anyone does is better or worse than another - Maybe that's my problem. I'm too nihilistic. So the choice comes again, - To be an optimist. My dreams are so general. I suppose I want to be happy like everyone else. I need someone to reassure me and not just myself all the time. It doesn't matter who it is - Everyone has flaws.. But it seems to me that I am the only one. Then you think about relationships and such - Why? I feel like it's a waste of time. Everything is a waste of time then. Maybe I'm just too smart - Or too stupid

So I'll hold onto that.. My vacations have been the most cherished memories of my life. That's why my dream is to travel the world. I need to find a way to make money so I can do that - Or friends that like to travel and have my back.. Good people and they can't be like myself. I need people to lift me up.

175976811,Yesterday I woke up and wish I hadn’t. Took everything in me to get out of bed. I felt exhausted and like life was moving in slow motion. I have been successful in forcing myself to go out and do things because on my bad days it’s hard to see a purpose. Been crying a lot too even over little things. Kinda upset knowing that even with medication and help I will probably never be my old self again. Despite this low period I’ve been doing fairly well but I can’t seem to find any consistency. My mood is really great or I’m in a period of crippling depression. I want to work towards finding a happy medium.

I emptied the entire first floor of all the clothes/jackets/shoes/outdoor gear. 12 big contractor garbage bags full of it! Tomorrow IF it’s cooler I’ll tackle the upstairs. It’s like an oven up there so I didn’t even consider it today. It was hard but I pushed through so that my husband didn’t have to do it. I know how emotional and mind ****ing it is to go through your parents stuff.

175976846,"Hello schizoloner: I believe this is your first post here on PC. Welcome to Psych Central. At the end of your post you wrote you need some guidance. Unfortunately I think the only guidance I would be able to offer you would be to find a psychologist or mental health therapist you can work with if you're not already doing so. Many years ago I had some of the same types of school experiences you describe in your post. And I also find myself struggling with thoughts similar to yours. I've also made 2 major attempts on my own life & done some of the same self-harming things you mentioned. But despite that, I don't think I would know what to tell you as far as how to get beyond feeling the way you do. (Perhaps other PC members will have some insights they can offer.) Anyway... thank you for bringing your concern here to PC. I hope you find PC to be of benefit."

I’m mixed with emotions and I’m feeling pressured into things because I want to make people happy. I don’t know what I’m dealing with one thing or another. I’m being vague right now for my privacy and well protection right now and don’t want things I’m typing being tracked back at me and hitting me in the *** because I feel like I’m being snooped on by someone right now.. I’m also dealing with med changes. There was a recall on one of my meds and I ended up getting rid of it because the med night of contained residue from another med. I ended up needing my med temporary lowered because of the situation. Also I was I. The hospital a few weeks ago. I was put on a different antipsychotic. Latuda now instead of the abilify injection. My hospital stay was horrible and the hospital that I liked going to had turned t

And sometimes I think, what if I had one of those conditions where say I was once frightened by a thunderstorm, and after that, whenever it started clouding up, I didn’t want to go for a walk. So, have you ever been frightened by a thunderstorm or some thing like that, and your mind is hyper attuned to that happening again? There are some sayings about this: 1. Sometimes fear is a warning. It’s like someone putting a hand on your shoulder and saying Go No Farther. (From: _NAME_ Rice, Memnoch the Devil) 2. Fear doesn’t shut you down; it wakes you up. – _NAME_, Divergent 3.

Most of them are about video games or movies or similar. Im not complaining really Im just wondering why? Is it because people with schizophrenia, or specifically schizoaffective disorder post in the bipolar (and other subchannels) about their issues? Or is it because people with schizophrenia tend to be less functional and might not spend their free time on here as much as more “with it” users might? Might not enjoy this medium so much because cognitive issues tend to be worse and tying serious stuff on here might be cognitively demanding? Im just wondering why this subforum is SO different from the bipolar one even though the amount of people with both issues (around 1% of the population each) is similar?

175976873,"I was on lamictal. It stopped my panic attacks and my bipolar symptoms. It takes a while to get on the right dosage because of the slow titration. Trileptal is what I'm on right now but beats it if it works for me at all. I was off lamictal or like 6 months and the only problem i had was insomnia and obviously Triliptal isn't helping with that. It's weight neutral and I can't really recall any side effects accept it can cause a rare rash, acne in some cases. It's really weird on the skin for some reason. I'd check and see if Triliptal can help first. I was going to recommend a moodstabilizer for your panic attacks because I've had no better panic/anxiety meds than my mood stabilzers for some reason.

The kind where you feel like you were born in the wrong world because it hurts so much. I've never met anyone who feels like this even though I have been to long term treatment and countless facilities. I wonder if I was not meant to be here. Nothing seems to work and there is no hope. I've genuinely felt like I've tried everything. A lot of days I just want a lobotomy so the pain will end but my family won't have to suffer.

175976899,"Hello. I am a 45 year old working professional. I think most days I identify more what I do for work than what I do for myself or in my free time. I am in a relationship that I feel I am self-sabotaging with my neediness, jealousy and low self-esteem. I think all that goes hand in hand. I hate my self image of myself. I used to be slender and in shape and now I feel I am a fat over-worked middle aged woman. I have no friends really. All I do is work, go home and cook/clean and take care of people. I think I have neglected taking care of myself for way too long. I want friends badly. When I have friends in my life, I seem to put them aside to focus and hone in on the man I am living with at the time. It has been this way with me for my last two relationships. My boyfriend tells me he loves me. I don't believe him and I question it. It is really causing strife in our relationship and I don't want to lose him. He does alot for me and my son and is there for us. I want to find friends and gain some sel
f-esteem back. I want to be the person I was in the past. I feel like I need to find the person I used to be. Where the heck did she go?"

175976918,"I'm not addicted to alprazolam whenever it wears off (Which is why people take it 3-4 times a day), - I'm dependent on the background tolerance (It's half life) so every 3-4 days, I'll take one. It's pretty mild. Clonazepam has a much longer half life so when you go 1-2 weeks without it, you have to take another one. I'd just take it as PRN. I'm tolerant to 0.5mg a day on average so my doctor would probably make me cold turkey it rather than giving 10mg diazepam to decrease by 2mg every 2 weeks."

175976923,"I was watching a netflix show about genetics, was looking up if I got an infection from heroin 3 years ago, then looking at different types of philosophies. Everything is pushing against me but I'm going to keep going on and on. I won't give up. For the first time, I'm not afraid of another panic attack. I'm not afraid of anything. If I get one, so be it. I'll sort it all out. My panic attacks I'm sure would last 12 hours if I don't take a benzo. And I know that I'd beg for mercy and say ""I'm going to die"", end up in the ER, they'd stabilize my blood pressure, say ""you're fine"". It's nonsense. But I have to make sense of it all. I've ignored a lot of notifications online already - But I'm going to open them and take what ever reality throws at me. I don't care. I'll make a plan and do something. I'll ignore all of the people that want to harm me - People are doing their things together. I'll do my things. A friend recommended that I switch my browser to a better one so I'm gonna organize all of 
my passwords cuz I have like 100+ passwords that I don't remember. I'm just gonna do things slowly and not rush - Enjoy what I'm doing in the moment. _PERSON_ was released from rehab to come off of clonazepam so I'm gonna watch the hour podcast that he made on benzo addiction."

I’m actually on a waitlist for a class. I mean for the teacher I chose. Hopefully 4 people don’t pay for the class and get dropped. I feel like this is the academic hunger games. Especially with “pass the initial 3 classes with a B and you will be qualified”. Hm ok. Let me just battle through this battle-royale-style war. Every man for himself to be able to hold the gauntlet of knowledge and be one of the few standing. I hate saying the word “tutor” because my dad used to make fun of me and say “oh you need a tutor? Don’t you already have a tooter? Haha”. Lmao."
175976938,I wish the psychiatrist would call me already. I hate waiting. I wish it was Friday so I could get paid and pay bills. I wish it was the weekend so I can study and crochet and try to relax. I wish it was Monday so I could talk to my doctor again and tell him I’m borderline manic still. I wish I had my tax return already. I wish I wish I wish. I wish I could sleep instead of thinking about everything else.

175976943,My mom got her CT scan back and they found two lumps in her brain. It's what I was fearing would happen. I don't feel anything emotionally - Even when I cry. It doesn't feel real. I don't know exactly how to feel or what to do. My mom is worried about what would happen to me - I want to tell her that I'd be fine. But I wasn't fine today. I drank some very low dose shroom tea before my mom and sister sat me down and told me. I want to support her but I think I'm in shock. She's getting another CT on Monday. Usually it would take 18 months so that's not a good sign. I'm in so much shock. In the morning I'll be as responsible as I can be.

Didn’t sleep much about 2 - 5:30. I’m going back to bed once I bring my daughter to school. Vet w/_PERSON_ today. So hoping he doesn’t have Lyme. Aside from getting sick...I don’t have any idea how I’ll get him to take 56 pills over a month. He breaks up the food and spits the pills out. Smart little punk.

175976948,"Hey everyone. How are things going? So I am recovering from a severe bacterial infection of Haemophilus influenzae. The infection is gone now, but I was in hospital for 4 days on IV antibiotics plus fluids, as well as in a quarantined room. I was severely dehydrated and had lost 20 pounds. I was throwing up and unable to hold food, meds, or water down. If we had waited much longer getting me in the hospital it was possible I may not have made it out alive. Still waiting to see if I had an infection in my bloodstream from this. It's scary looking back. Now I am dealing with Reactive Thrombocytosis as a result of the infection. A temporary, but concerning high levels of platelets in my bloodstream, leaving me at risk of blood clots. I talk to a doctor Friday about that, but if I show signs of clots I will go to A&E immediately. I am just thankful to be alive after all this. It's been a crazy two weeks of acute infection and 4 weeks of ill health."

175976959,"I went onto a stimulant discord (I'm not abusing stimulants but I like to talk to hyper people) and I've been talking with someone for a few days - He's tripped a lot and seems to stand out from the other users. He asked for some new music a few times and I sent him some. I told him that I'm trying to play guitar but don't do it often - Showed him some songs that I wanted to play on guitar and piano. He showed me his living room and it looks professional (He says he likely will never make money from it but enjoys playing). I said that I try to write songs but have no rhythm so I suck at it so he gave me lots of tips on music etc.. I added him as a friend so he could give me tips - Then I can get into playing. A lot of the songs I want to play on guitar are electric so I'm gonna save up for an electric guitar. I remember when I was in a ""band"" 2 years ago, the friends I had were saying that I learn really quickly with the guitar and I would be better than them eventually. I got to a point where I 
was teaching my friend who was teaching me guitar. So I feel good about that.. When I get back from the house on wednesday, I'm gonna play more music as a distraction from my mental issues and such.. Because I love music.. I told him about how my mom was a piano teacher and would teach me as a kid but she didn't have time and it was just a phase.. My mom knows music theory but I'm more of an autistic savant when it comes to music - I can play by ear etc.. It can help my mind from deteriorating too..

I'm gonna keep updating my mental health symptom chart even though I'm doing pretty good now.. That's why I believe that psychedelics can really be therapeutic even though they can cause bad effect short term.. long term is what matters.. My mom has like 6 personalities..

Maybe I'll have to go to work or move. My dad doesn't have a house. He just goes places when he's off work for a few weeks. He said he would buy a house. But then how long is he going to live.. a few years? My mom said that today she just needed to process everything but now she's ready to fight the cancer. She's always been my caregiver. Now I'm hers at an instant and need to be strong for her. I said that I would be strong but she was crying because she doesn't know how I'm going to survive without her. My mom will always be with me even after she dies. That will keep me strong."

175976985,I recently found the PANSS rating scale and I'm filling it out 1x a week to see if there's any changes for me.
175976986,"I learned a valuable lesson yesterday, and that is to not chop wood in sandals. Within 5 minutes of getting to a campsite eight friends, I wanted to try a buddy’s new axe, and long story short, sliced my big toe through the nail all the way through ?. Went to Urgent Care, who took Xrays and they refused to stitch me up because they feared bone involvement and the emergency room would be better equipped. So, I sat in the ER alone for 2.5 hours waiting to be called back. They’re not letting any spouses or partners in, so this added a whole other element of panic in me. I tried to stay as calm as possible, and for the most part succeeded. When I was called back, the attending physician, RN, and NP reviewed the X-rays and concluded the bone was not involved and the injury would require stitches. Stitches are a first for me, but it wasn’t too bad. They nerve blocked the toe so I couldn’t feel anything besides some discomfort and mild stinging. They opted not to do antibiotics -just a tetanus sho
t- because there was no bone involvement, just an ointment and proper wound care, and the sutures come out in 10 days. I feel like my mental state is in more pain and agony than my toe ?. From being in the ER alone and watching everything around me ranging from mild to severe (they called a code blue when I was there??) , to replaying the wood chopping incident, pretty much everything related to this situation was traumatic. I was able to sleep a little bit last night and this morning, but am completely on edge. I’m fearful of an infection. Terrified, actually. Ugh, what a night."
175976987,Going to try to go look at a house today
175976988,"So Valley, what time did the kids get home? Glad everything went well. It's freezing in my room. I'm going to have to put on my winter coat. Looking at watch reviews didn't help. They say battery life is poor, the notifications don't work well, etc etc etc. Maybe this will be just another year of giving him nothing. Haven't heard from him since Wednesday."
175976989,I’ve been so distracted today I haven’t really gotten any work done I just keep thinking things and googling. If work is monitoring my searches they probably think I’m psycho.

I have mood swings, I get angry very fast( maybe I got my temper from my dad or maybe it's just hormones, I don't know) According to my mom, having mood swings is a crime, staying up late and eating junk food like a normal 16-year-old is a crime. I suffer from anxiety, I have been suffering for almost a year now. I tried talking to my mom about it, but she either didn't care or thought I was making it all up. I told my mom I need help, I begged for help and I didn't get any. I told my mom we need to go see a therapist, for my anxiety, and just problems that happen in our family, she simply says that eating good food, going to bed early and not watching too much laptop(point to be taken because of covid-19 my school is online, I obviously have to stare at a computer screen for long hours) requires behaving sensibly and not a therapist. I'm sick of everything happening in my life, I want to get the hell

175977002,"I'm so tired. I've been exhausted since I got out of the hospital. I don't know why. I am fighting some sort of respiratory thing (it's NOT corona virus). All I want to do is sleep. I slept yesterday afternoon before the Super Bowl. Then I did some therapy homework. It was hard explaining to people at Church why I was in the hospital. Plus they seem to think that 4 days IP should have cured me. Yeah, right. I see _PERSON_ tonight. Kind of worried about how that is going to go. I just really want to sleep. I'm at work though so I can't really do that. _PERSON_"
175977003,"BTW, I didn't mean to sound like i had AsPD (which I don't). Just that it's not a very schizoid feature I was describing. In the end I left ""work"" entirely and have attempted being my own boss.... so far the results aren't promising. Good luck."
175977004,I'll have to talk to my therapist today about relapsing on everything and then flushing them down the toilet. At least I did that.. something right..
175977005,"I'm having a good week. I'm not manic or anything because I'm not bipolar. I just don't feel super depressed and crappy. Plus I have tomorrow off of work. Oh that reminds me, just so you guys don't worry. I have three days off of work so you might not see me over the weekend. Don't worry I'm fine. I just usually am not online much if I am not at work. But I might try to check in and say hello!"
175977006,"I don't know who I am. The psychedelic trip should have happened when I was 14. That's the exact age where I wouldn't have been messed up over the coming years after. I'm like an AI. I don't think of myself as a real person. I'm horribly confused. There's so many things that I can do - But I do what gives me dopamine (Listening to music and tending to my chemical crops - And yes it's kinda funny).. But Jesus.. I have mental fatigue. I could talk and talk but I get tired. Everything is pointless to me. I don't want to impress the world, do anything - Get married, have kids, meaningless job. I want to make enough money to consume/create out of survival. I don't consume things - Like TV, movies, meaningless hobbies - I meditate philosophically. I'm just philosophical as hell. All I see are pictures and I'm in the middle with everything - Indecisive, boring - But I don't care. I managed to help a lot of people - Was it recorded? No. It doesn't make me happy because there's no proof - It's jinxed by non
sensical society of delusion. Like a forest of trees on fire, screaming in pain and all you can see is their mouths and eyes. So it's like, with technology and the world - All these scientists are praised but people remember things and get their dopamine from specifics - Ignorant about other possible things. I just can't accept that I have to be ignorant about 99.9% of things - Create a life in this trip is an illusion. I should just study philosophy. But I love music and chemicals - The deep meaning in them. I never liked math - But now I come to see it's relevance in nature - Although I'm always attracted to meaningful things. All I do is talk to myself everywhere I go - I have no connection just addiction. I bleed for understanding because I've put the work all into the wrong things, changed my mind, convictions, beliefs. I'm not the same person. I like people that have ADHD because it's chaos and we're OK with that. It's nonsense. There's a cure for everything, there's hope. I'd like to be a nihilistic as
shole like _NAME_ in ""_NAME_ and Morty"" but I'm also have mirror neurons and empathy. I'm tortured by what is happening in my life - and the world. But I just don't care. It's constant reactions to things. I have insight - Not psychotic. I make good friends that like me - Maybe because I just write and write and they're entertained by my existence. Or I'm weird and somewhat smart. I get mad sometimes but I'm quite calm and see no point in natural reactions. It pains me to see people living when I philosophize things to a deeper meaning waaaay too much. I have my own dealings withishes. I'm just venting. I feel like everything is like black mirror and the philosophy negative nihilist is right. All of these logical people foolishly saying ""You're stupid"" when people don't go in depth to something that never ends and the illogical energy people hunting ghosts. It's like a bad trip. People believe things and have their grounding - Play video games. I'm just enlightened and talk to people that are the same too 
- They are in the most pleasant way, anonymous, modest, optimistic nihilists with trauma. I just want to be a negative hippie. I already am. People say I'm not crazy and I'm ok - I have good insight. Crazy good insight. It's like everything is just a figure of my imagination. I'm Jesus and Buddha."

175977013,Yeah in some ways
175977014,"I know it sounds kind of weird but yknow the way I fear people having sex near me and the average person doesn't really care - Since I feel more fear, is that a delusion? Is anxiety a form of delusion? ""For instance, most of the common anxiety disorders are underpinned by a set of dysfunctional beliefs that simply don’t represent the objective reality of the world, and in this sense they might be characterized as ‘delusional’ beliefs."" But anyways yeah I'm feeling tired will take zopiclone and sleep. Good night SP. Hope you get to sleep soon =] If you're awake thinking and you have no choice, at least you get the chance to solve problems in your head.. It can be fun.. Although considered as a little crazy to do that... Although the Invega must have kicked in so I don't feel the ""sense"" of discomfort from weird things in reality.... Remember, I'm Jesus or Buddha. Not you. You're a figment of my imagination - Hope that helps.."

175977021,"I know, they look gentle in the pictures. But when you see one come out of a small wooded area of your back yard, 50 feet from your house, that's not a comforting sight. Also it's also only 40 feet from where my grand kids jump on the trampoline. But even without that, just thinking about walking down my back driveway not more than 20 feet from where he could be, with his cub, is more than I can contemplate. Also there is a stray cat that lives next door, who walks down my driveway. What a surprise that would be for the cat, thinking everything's was OK. And a stray dog could notice the fox and attack him, like _NAME_ said, and then I could have a stray dog that's chewed up. I called my local vets office today, with _NAME_ nudging and such a suggestion from a neighborhood website, and they gave me the names of some people who trap, and one of them is supposed to come by in a couple of weeks."

175977038,Hi honey my name is _PERSON_ and I am a 30 year old mother of 3. I have been a victim to and the butt kicker of depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember. Victim and buttkicker are the first words that came to mind when i think of the years that have passed. Because yes everyone has good days and some bad but we aren't the lucky ones. The bad days out number the good and the few good we end up with we have to fight like hell to get. But in all honesty I have come to realize that fighting for the good ones make them that much better. I have been on a hand full of different medication. Some I really thought were helping and then others made me absolutely crazy. With mental illnesses you have to go along with the medicine guessing game until you find the one that works for you. It took me 23 years but I finally found mine. Prozac has been a god send. It took a bit longer for me because I put myself through alot of extra problems. Im sorry I feel like im just talking to talk so i will wrap it 
up. Try to keep yourself busy if your unable to do so atleast try to keep you mind. Thats when i become my own worst enemy when i have time to think and get so far in my head i get lost. if you ever need someone to just listen while you vent im here. Just one stranger can make all the difference. #Fightdepression
175977039,"I should just talk on here I suppose. I seem to have even more health problems popping up, seemingly out of nowhere but I know they must’ve been building up over time. Just didn’t notice them. I woke up from a nap today and it felt like there was a space in my teeth like I was missing a tooth. I think because I been grinding my teeth due to whatever. Maybe meds. When I sleep. So my teeth have shifted dramatically my mom is going to y’all and make fun of me if she sees it. I have a slight chip in my front tooth that’s just barely noticeable. But she said if people see it they will laugh and always remember me by that. So I’ve become extremely self conscious about my teeth now. I’ve never had braces growing up etc they were always perfect. Haven’t been for a few years now tho. I was looking at my body in the mirror yesterday cuz my weight is going up and down. My weight is a huge problem. I’m 5’2 barely, and have a small stature/bone structure, so My weight has pretty much deformed 
my spine, into an “S” shape... I can’t do much for long or I’ll get bad back pain. I seem to need to crack my back every 15 min to relieve the pain. But I also have a compressed spinal disk due to my weight. Gosh not to mention My spine has re-angled it self to being on my phone/computer so much. So there’s a hump on my neck cuz it’s reangled itself to adjust to my looking down all the time. And with my Chiari 1, my migraines are unbearable. Not to mention my chest plate has been sticking outward slightly due to the hump on my neck. It’s just a huge S shape now starting from the back of my neck. I went to a spine doctor. They eyed my spine for 5 min and said I need to goto a physical therapist. I felt angry. I waited 3-4 months to see this dude dude to corona and a waiting list and in 5 min he said I need to goto physical therapist..."

175977041,"Yikes. Probably shouldn't have been so **** impulsive in dropping grad school again. Now I have to pick up the pieces again. 'Cept they won't let me back this time. I am so angry with myself. I convinced myself that I wasn't passionate about it. And look where that got me. Depressed again. Not looking for pity here, nor do I really pity myself. Just needed to express that."
175977042,"True, true. I think taking my meds at a set time at night helps sometimes in regulating those thoughts. In terms of the racing thoughts and stuff and it helps me get to bed at a reasonable hour."
175977043,"My issues with anxieties and depression caused me emotional distress back when I was having serious issues with both. But currently these issues have not caused me physical problems. I don't have diabetes or fibromyalgia or anything like that, fortunately for me."

175977045,"Good thing there's a philosopher on here! Yeah I feel like I need to deserve happiness.. By doing something.. When I move to Vancouver Island, I'm gonna have more space to be able to do things.. I want to draw and play instruments. I think being a neuropsychopharmacologist would not make me happy. I feel like my time is up for becoming a scientist - I don't like working on the clock and I can't work under pressure - I'm more creative now. Psychedelics made me realize that to me, my creativity and feeling type personality are more important than the logical and thinking side. But I love learning. I used to just do absolutely nothing but sleep for a few years. The psychedelic made me realize what other people already do. I like listening to podcasts, reading articles or books, _NAME_ talks, Netflix (I never used to do these things). I'll check out the courses. I still have a physics course to do. I'll still do it for a brain exercise and because I'm interested in physics."

It's not hot inside. The air conditioner makes it cold. I like being bundled up anyway. I don't control the office temperature. Everyone else is like it's so hot. I don't know. Got my work mostly done. I can do some more electronic filing. It's boring though. I did one months worth this morning. Will try to do one month this afternoon. If I go at this pace, I'll be done in 4 more work days with the electronic filing. Couldn't get _NAME_ to eat much this morning. She's been catching and killing lizards. Yuck. Then the dog and my other kitty _NAME_ bring them in the house. Double yuck. _NAME_ used to in her prime kill birds and lizards but she would eat the lizards and get sick. _NAME_ doesn't seem to eat them, just kills them. Yuck, yuck, yuck.

175977058,"As a bipolar, I can't really drive a car without thinking the other drivers are out to get me. If somebody is too close to my back bumper, I want to get out and beat the stuffings out of them. I've been in two road rage situations, where the drivers actually got out of their cars, one was about to approach me, and the other one did before I drove off through a red light. I had to stop driving for health reasons, mine and theirs. None of my drivers have ever stopped the car and threatened to beat the stuffings out of anybody. None of my drivers have ever had bipolar disorder. My dad stopped and got out of the car once, but he had anger personality disorder. I can't hardly walk around the block without getting into it with somebody. The only thing that saves me is there are not many people who walk around my block. I used to have neighbors on all three sides of me who I got into it with. I now have only two neighbors who I get into it with because the third one moved, and the house has sat vacant for 
four years. That house I have no problem with. I haven't seen my grown son in three years because he hacked me off. Besides not driving anymore, another thing that helps me is that I take Lithium for the mania part of my bipolar and Mirtazapine for the depression. The Lithium reduces my paranoia. I've had many jobs where I got into trouble with my co-workers. You say, ""I thought depression was more having suicide thoughts and bursting into tears a lot. I’ve been unmotivated for years. And not feeling like getting out of bed in the morning is just from my sleep apnea."" And, ""I read a Facebook post that said that depression was not having the motivation to do anything. I thought that was just laziness."" And, ""I was bullied my mean women at my part time job for over 6 months. It was constant indirect harassment. I left and the one woman stalked me to the other job. She trashed me to all the surrounding businesses. People I didn’t even know were talking about me. She posted something about me on the inte
rnet which I don’t even know how to find."" So, I'm wondering, do you see a psychiatrist? They deal with people like us, thank goodness. They can improve depression.Post Edited (_NAME_) : 2/7/2020 5:11:03 PM (GMT-7)"

175977062,"_PERSON_, I think it is a beautiful thing that you are doing the selfless act of putting yourself outside of your comfort zone in order to see your grandfather. Many people can't or won't, and miss out on some very special interactions and chances to show love to their family members who won't be here forever. Well done. Surely what is adding to your anxiety is the fact that you have to deal with some difficult family dynamics once you are there. I have the worst anxiety while flying to see my in laws. When we are going on a fun family vacation I can fly with little worries...but when going to see my hub's folks...just knowing the stress that awaits me there is enough to make for a miserable flight. So maybe if you can make a plan to limit your interaction with the stressful family members while visiting, you will feel less trepidation about the drive/trip in general. I know you can do this! I just hope that you experience as little anxiety as possible from start to return! Let us know how you are

175977071,"I'm new here and just wanting somewhere to express how I'm feeling i guess. I'm at a pretty low point right now, going through therapy and discussing things I never knew really bothered me has been hard. I find myself cutting more and more people off while I isolate myself (literally) alone. I'm going to be 22 this week and I just keep thinking about how I shouldn't be feeling like this all the time. Recently work has been pretty stressful due to covid, im a healthcare worker (not directly with covid patients) and of course our business is still up and running but with even more restrictions and guidelines to follow and it just seems like no matter what I do, its never good enough. I at one time had to cover for someone who was off for covid and still do my job at the same time, and when one job had to take priority over the other, the other was completely messed up. Things since then have gotten better staffing wise at work but I still go in feeling like my best isn't enough. My manager makes me s

I'm feeling overwhelmed not only with work but everything else too. I'm coming to the realization that a lot of people I love have hurt me so much that it still affects me today. I constantly feel like im a burden to the people around me, my whole life I've been told i was difficult but i was just an inconvenience to whoever told me that. Im writing this as I worry about work tomorrow, in bed, alone. This is kind of a cry for help because I never do this lol.. Any advice is appreciated, or even just kind words.

It's unhealthy to bottle them up. It really does a number on men sometimes. I remember when I first used the term ""cute"", it was difficult to say because it isn't a masculine term, but its an apt way to describe some stuff. So _PERSON_ belives there is a animus (He) and anima (she) aspect to all of us, male or female, along with a shadow(your inner demon) and a host of other narratives in our ""collective unconscious"". Even with the shadow, we ought to work on bringing that one in and acccpeting it, because once we do that it no longer rules us. Individuaiton is accepting all narratives (the collective unconscious) and this carries enlightenment with it."

It is because I perceive things wrong and get panic. I had a hard time looking at the cluster of blisters behind my leg because I was scared of having anxiety. So I was forced to show it to my mom on the phone camera, and she told me that finally blisters are dried and look like they are getting better. I know it sounds funny but. well yeah, even so now I can't look at what's there. At least now I know it is getting better. I have less pain, actually, pain is almost gone."

I know if it was ME I would sure request the test be done, it may just be the cause of all your going thru. Your always in my thoughts so when I ran across this I couldn't help but to post it to you.

175977118,"I went to the doctor the other day to get my breathing checked. When he entered the room he waggled his handshaking hand and said some words. Because I'd been floating around in my mind while waiting, I took in ""shake your hand"" and assumed it was what he wanted due to the additional aforementioned waggling. Being the adept _USER_ID_ I am, along with trying to decipher his odd behavior, I suspiciously appraised the dark thickly rubbered gloved hand and searched for ribbing or any other bells and whistles (reminded me of a meme) - and then made a mental note to decrease the amount of time I look at weird stuff. I also noted to myself that a doctor asking to shake hands felt like a bit of a strange request in times like these. Yet, I justified that it would be ok because I was masked, he was covered from head to toe and surely he must change gloves in between people. Succumbing to my compliant nature and deep compassion (especially for the strange), I nodded curiously, blankly, and then my eyes cri
nkled into a friendly smile as I reached my hand towards his. He looked down at it from behind his eye shield unnerved and jumped past it, and through his mask he repeated, ""Like I said, I'm not going to be shaking people's hands right now."" Similarly, I think, to how a women says ""no means no"" I'd like to say the visit recovered or that it at least didn't decline further, but I can't. It all leaves me wondering"

175977120,"So many different covers of this song Sweet Dreams - _NAME_ Perhaps I'm regressing since I seem to be transitioning backwards to older tool and from there, to older _NAME_ manson like the following from the Antichrist Superstar album Tourniquet - _NAME_ That old cabin I lived in, had a mural on the wall in different shades of blue and white that one of the previous tenants painted. I'd listen to tool's opiate ep and undertow and this album while smoking and drawing for hours and hours. These last few days, I've really felt like drawing. I've even pulled out my drawing stuff, but I don't know if it'll happen - creativity is like being possessed for me; it's rarely a choice The last time I attempted to ""draw"" was on a few of the glass beads I used to lampwork. You melt the bead and then use a really thin rod of glass near the torch to ""draw"" with it (melt it) onto your bead. One time, I caught my hair on fire. Another time, I managed to burn my lip and went to 12 Step meetings looking like I had 
a crack pipe burn on it which got me some concerned looks from people with whom I was aquianted. Anyways, on the topic of symbolism mentioned in the other thread, what I practiced drawing, were eyes for some reason. For drawing inspiration, I looked up Evil Eye - which online tends to be considered synonymous with the Eye of Horus - except in reality, the eye of horus was drawn for protection against ill intent / the ""evil eye"" Later down the road, I finally observed that people draw it in two directions and I wondered about the difference from a symbolic perspective. I learned that symbolically one side is the eye of horus and on the other side is the Eye of Ra, and I discovered I've always drawn the eye of ra on my beads. Both were believed to be protective - except the eye of horus is the receptive, feminine which was used with the hope of absorbing/neutralizing the ill intent (the ""evil eye"") Whilst the Eye of Ra (which I'd never heard of until then), was the projective, masculine aspect. Which makes 
sense since Thoth was the Egyptian version of Hermes, I think - and Hermeticism dictates that there's both gender and polarity in things. I transfer it into humans; that we're all comprised of and capable of both ""good"" and ""evil;"" however, I respect that many other individuals disagree, and I acknowledge that I may be abstracting the aforementioned concept to suit my liking. Unlike its benign counterpart, the eye of ra was drawn in hope of violently sending that ill intention (""evil eye"") back onto the original person like a ""curse."" That being said, I'm a type of Christian, so I prefer to avoid drawing symbols altogether these days - but they're certainly pretty to look at! Lol. I also have the ""I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas"" song in my head. I don't think I want one though. I would love an Alligator, a Goliath Taranula and a pretty Pink and Black one too, one of those dinosaur style Shoebilled Storks and a Cobra (sadly these last two eat snakes, so I could never), an Armadillo, an outdoor P
ink Flamingo, a Black Tiger Snake (if it's not canabalistic), a Boelen's Python, a Boa Constrictor... I'd also like to meet a Giraffe. Why can't I stop procrastinating?"

And the effects of what happened afterwards is very similar - Withdrawing, isolating and trying to make myself smaller and invisible. Because the brain is a muscle so you either use it or lose it. I think one of the problems with making my brain more active is that I'll find it harder to sleep.

The Bible tells us that if we raise our child in God we won’t go far. So all you have to do is repent of your sins and ask God to live inside you. Its that simple. Then you pray and read your bible every day, connect with a prayer group or bible study group. We can encourage and pray for one another. If you put God first in your life, everything else just falls into place according to His will. Be encouraged and know God has plans for you if you will only ask Him to show you.

174371000,"Hello, I have been living with schizoaffective disorder for the last 10 years. I experienced my first symptoms when I was 18 years old. Shortly after that I lived in a permanent state of psychosis for approximately 3 years. I completely lost touch with reality. There was no one in the world that I trusted. Not even my own family. It was very isolating and terrifying. It consumed every part of my life. Fortunately, I ""snapped out"" of my psychosis and came back to reality when I was about 21 years old. Although I ""I am back to reality"" I still suffer from severe paranoia, delusions, and extreme anxiety daily. I have tried countless medications with no success. All I have gotten from the medications I have tried are side effects (extreme fatigue, twitching, blurry vision, etc..). This disorder has robbed me of my friendships, family, and future. I am desperate to get better and will try anything. Have any of you tried (or know someone who has tried) medication that has been effective? If so what w
as it called?"

Not a movie or TV series, but it kinda feels like one in some ways, except it's better: Night in the Woods. It's a really good game. It's not for everyone, but it is very much for people who struggle with aimlessness, purposelessness and being chronically out of place. It changed my general perspective on life in some permanent and significant ways. It's funny that while most reviews praise the game, they all say that ""the main character is very hard to sympathize with or relate to"", but to me the game was so significant exactly because of all the major ways how I did see myself in her. I've seen people dismissing it as ""cutesy"", but it's really not. It's about mental illness, alienation and social decay, and it makes it abundantly clear that it's about those things.

175977199,"Jered, I had long periods of deep self-hatred over my lifetime. What I learned is to let go of the feelings and thoughts about my past behaviors. It is most helpful if you simply recognize that you have tons and tons of company. People are very adept on hiding their terrible secrets from others. Some are out there for all to see. The two types are the same if they had been doing the same things. Doing foolish and regrettable things in life is quite normal behavior. No need in beating yourself up over a most human way of acting. Forget about the past and look forward. Free your heart and become your own best friend. So what about the past! It IS in the past. This day is the most important day of your life because it is now and you are still breathing. Letting go of past mistakes will allow your spirit to lift up. You may even find a smile when you look into the mirror. Just forget about the past, remember that was yesterday and you have a brand new day in today. It is your call what you will do with 
THIS day!! Make it a good day!! Hang in there things can go very well for you. Ahoyha"

I can see the loss of income plus the stress of sickness has taken a huge toll on many. The economy is bad along with the political infighting. I am retired now and have seen much in my lifetime. I have never seen times like this. I used to volunteer to work at our local soup kitchen but its been closed down for over two months now. It does break my heart not being able to help others. I just wanted to say my thoughts and prayers are with everyone here. I suffer as do all of you with anxiety. I pray everyday we can find a cure for covid19.

This is because you can hallucinate that something is present in the recording or have that delusion.

I can have the problem of sometimes running into the same thoughts too many times but sometimes it makes me wonder if those are the ones I need to listen to the most. I see pictures a lot in my head that make me feel like I am watching mini movie clips at times and sometimes that makes me feel like I have a _USER_ID_ picture of the world around me as my thoughts can get in the way sucking myself inwards. When I interact with the outside world my thoughts become more abstract in nature to the point where if someone brings up a certain subject or question, my mind brings up certain key words or pictures to represent an idea. I can derive statements from the images which sometimes present themselves as literal objects or sometimes even diagram like in nature. It is like I am reading the metadata within them somehow and they appear as words on this here, screen."

When I get this condition it is usually along with needing to blow my nose due to a very slight drippy nose. Besides just a cold, you might want to consider if something in your environment is causing the reaction, or even something you're eating."

I already have a T but when I told him I only see her every couple weeks, he said, that's not enough support, which is what people keep telling me. But anyway the reason he wants to see me is because he thinks he can do some ""tweaking"" of my thoughts. He does CBT therapy which I don't like, but with a religious bent I guess. I'm not good at knowing what my thoughts are, but he got me to be able to tell him a couple of thoughts just standing there talking in the sanctuary. He asked me what meds I'm on. I don't know whether to tell him about the Self Harm and hallucinations and stuff or just keep it simple since it's only two sessions. I have to ask my T first though because you aren't supposed to see two T's at one time. But he said he isn't trying to steal me away from current T, he just thinks he has some techniques that might help. IDK what do you guys think? HUGS Kit"

175977245,"So after the realization a few days/weeks ago about how I’m out of touch with my emotions, here’s the keys I found on how to work on it. 1. Figuring out why you’re having the emotion 2. Figuring out what sensation in your body that you’re having 3. Thinking about the deeper meaning behind the emotion. Not just figuring out what triggers the emotion but also figuring out why’s that emotion that’s being triggered 4. Telling yourself that it’s safe to have that emotion 5. Finding out the proper way to direct your emotion 6. Putting the right emotion for things that are really matter in your life. After I got out of the numb feeling that I experienced for years, I became a ball of emotions. I cry, laugh, angry, etc easily. But it doesn’t mean that I’m consciously aware of my emotions. Therefore they just jump out of nowhere, exploding fast and messy, like when you shake a soda and pop it out. So yeah I hope by using these steps I can control my emotions better."

174371130,"Well, it sounds like you hit upon it. You said, ""Hmm...now that you put it this way, I do suspect that maybe she's schizo-affective...? Like maybe Bipolar + Schizophrenic...? Sigh...this doesn't make me feel better too..."" Well, it might not make you feel better but it does sound like you may have remembered what her condition has been called. Typing ""schizoaffective disorder"" into the search engine, it says in the _USER_ID_.org website: ""Schizoaffective disorder is a chronic mental health condition characterized primarily by symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of a mood disorder, such as mania and depression. ""The symptoms of schizoaffective disorder can be severe and need to be monitored closely. Depending on the type of mood disorder diagnosed, depression or bipolar disorder, people will experience different symptoms: • Hallucinations, which are seeing or hearing things that aren’t there. • Delusions, which are false, fixed beliefs that are he
ld regardless of contradictory evidence. • Disorganized thinking. A person may switch very quickly from one topic to another or provide answers that are completely unrelated. • Depressed mood. If a person has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder depressive type they will experience feelings of sadness, emptiness, feelings of worthlessness or other symptoms of depression. • Manic behavior. If a person has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder: bipolar type they will experience feelings of euphoria, racing thoughts, increased risky behavior and other symptoms of mania. • A period during which there is a major mood disorder, either depression or mania, that occurs at the same time that symptoms of schizophrenia are present. • Delusions or hallucinations for two or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode. • Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the illness. • The abuse of drugs or a medication are not respo
nsible for the symptoms. Treatment ""Schizoaffective disorder is treated and managed in several ways: • Medications, including mood stabilizers, antipsychotic medications and antidepressants"" So she may have had the right medicine, an antipsychotic, but she was also not given a mood stabilizer such as Lithium, which I'm on, or an antidepressant, which I'm on also (Mirtazapine). So maybe right diagnosis, wrong medicine. I don't know, but with her condition and mental state, and then her missing, something about that diagnosis/medication was way off, in my view. You said her condition was: ""mood changes, being suddenly energetic, suddenly lethargic, having impaired judgment, hearing voices, not sleeping at all for a few days, grand ideas about getting a new place and applying for new jobs, not being able to focus (blank stare), withdrawing from me and our activities totally, fingers twitching every few seconds, suddenly bursting into tears, irrational fear of dust mites and seeing black shadows in the room.
"" That seems to match schizoaffective disorder. You're wondering, ""Could it still be Bipolar...? Hm..."" I don't think it's bipolar. You asked, ""_NAME_ and _PERSON_, have you ever abandoned/left your spouses for days/weeks out of the blue...? And did you all ever return...? Thanks for the input ya."" I never did that, but that is a good question. I know you're pretty worried. Are you able to get some sleep? Are you getting any help yourself, or know where you can go to get help if you need it? Yes, I think you're right to message her from time to time. I wouldn't blame myself for feeling less stress that's she's away from the house. Are you able to stay busy? As for taking care of yourself, I would try to eat good meals, get enough sleep, work on other things. After all, it's her not you who is having the problems. I would also try to stay positive that you can get through this. If you stay positive, you're going to come up with more good ideas, for you are telling your mind, we can get through this. Post

I didn't think I could get hooked on such a low dose -but I was wrong. trouble is drs are reluctant to prescribe what really works for sleep and that's ambiean. my dr easily prescribed klonopin but refused my request for ambiean and my family dr as well.

175977299,That’s really sad. I was amazed at how many people showed up for my second mom’s funeral. It seemed like majority of the Indian community in _NAME_ showed up at the funeral. Everyone that eulogized her talked about her kindness to everyone that she met at the temple whenever she was there. Some of the people who spoke didn’t even know her name they just called her _PERSON_. All of her nieces and nephews who lived in America were able to attend the funeral as well as all cousins and relatives who also lived in America. Everyone that spoke also talked about her kindness and her beautiful smile. I felt like I couldn’t talk because I was also going through a divorce and didn’t want to bring that up in front of everyone there. My sister was able to talk for our whole family.

175977303,"So my friend wants me to contact people I was rude to and apologize. I used to believe in doing things like that, but my current perspective is to let it go because once people have washed their hands of you they really have no wish to hear from you again. But if he wants to contact people I guess he can. The energy on me today is very heavy. Anxiety mixed with pessimism. I wish I could just be happy. I'm afraid two of my favorite bracelets are lost.

175977304,"I closed that door pretty hard on myself due to this illness and with aid from my exgirlfriend. I had no clue she had that much hate in her heart. I remember when she said she wanted a break, and she teared up, and said she was afraid of losing her best friend. Then I show weakness in a 5 minute conversation 4 years later--while under psychosis--and she felt she had a license to screw me over. It was crazy. I helped her so much, and all she had to do was nothing. Ohwell, I think she fell into her own trap given how she positioned, cornered, herself against me. I guess we both lacked _NAME_. But honestly, I had the best excuse in the world for what I did, there is no better excuse than psychosis. Anyway, teaching is why I write I suppose. I think I have pretty good taste, but my writing isn't up to my own taste, so I have to keep trying until I get to the level where im satisfied. I just wish writing didn't take me so long, and that I had more days to write. Honestly, one of my greatest fears is not 
making a meaningful difference in the world. After college, with no hope for graduate school, I had to figure out how I could still make a difference. I can't think of another way other than writing. :-/"

I can tell you that voice is saying to kill yourself than it's not God; and please remember that you are valuable, worthy enough that God (whatever God is) made the very unique you. Have you checked with your doctor about your medications, some of mine take up to 6 weeks to get to an effective level which really sucks sometimes. I'm with you about the music, love it, and also like to pet the dogs, go outside, play with the kids, and read. Meditation and breathing exercises help me too and my doctor just suggested journal keeping and tracking my sleep with a log; the bipolar sure throws that off. I guess I'm saying please don't give up, keep trying to reach out to people (harder for us schizo affectives) and researching things that might help. It's just that way: some days will be bad, some will be very good, and most somewhere in between; and I'm to always try to think of at least one thing I'm grateful about, I can hear and see

175977314,"Lately I feel more and more withdrawn from others. It seems like everyone I talk to just wants to hear the happy stories and see smiles. People get concerned if I don't wear a ""happy"" face. Comments like ""You seem happier then yesterday"", it just makes me shy away from people more and more. Why are people so afraid of being honest. This world isn't just about happiness, there is so much messed up stuff going on and no one even knows what this world really is. So why are we all supposed to pretend like everything is going to be ok? Why can't we talk about the real world? I've come to realize that I won't change, whatever I have, my sadness, my anxiety, I accept it, I want it, I need it. But I can't deal with people expecting me to be something else and wanting more from me. Where are the people that understand that it's ok to be sad, it's normal to be afraid. I don't want to pretend. I think the it would feel amazing to have someone say ""You look great today"" even though I am not smiling, look

175977322,"Well, with no fear of judgements, I swear to be completely honest and thereby share my story trusting this platform. Two days ago I turned 20 years old. Two years back in time, I started being obsessed over a guy. The guy told me to loose weight like 20 pounds and he'd like me. I became bulimic and anorexic from that moment. Next year I left the guy but didn't leave those habits of throwing up food and barely eating. I always wanted to pursue law as a career field but just to earn more and to seek attention in society, I took engineering (Computer Science). I went college about 2500km away from my native place. I continued without eating and throwing up. It was weird, one day I became happy and on the other I started crying badly and called my parents hoping to die or to leave or to run and next day back to normal, happy as a bird. These things continued, last December I started getting extremely sick and was diagnosed with Tuberculosis, so I came back home. From the day I am at home, I have been f
ighting almost every day. two months back I started hurting myself either by banging my head on wall or punching myself in face or things as such. I have continuously been breaking things or myself, without any reason. One day I plead to join law college and other day I become happy with engineering. I am confused, extremely confused what is wrong with me. From last one week I decided to take a pic whenever I cry unexpectedly or laugh unexpectedly and to my surprise it has been alternate days. One day I love my life, other day I beg for death. I just don't get what's wrong, can anyone help before it's too late."

175977329,"I understood magical thinking to be more than that, so I looked around and am annoyed by the inconsistency. Now, I'm assuming that even though odd beliefs and magical thinking are in one criteria, they are separate? The APA's Dictionary definition (as do other sources) describes it the way you did: ""Magical Thinking the belief that events or the behavior of others can be influenced by one’s thoughts, wishes, or rituals."" The APA's DSM 5: ""2. Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, or “sixth sense”: in children and adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations)."" I realize I emeshed the concept of ""Magical Thinking"" and ""Odd Beliefs"" together with ""Ideas of Reference"" I neglect most people even if I like them because the interactions are a lot of work with very little payoff; it's draining. The drain will cause me to not want to make eye contact or have flat aff
ect and avoid phone calls or social situations, etc. Sometimes I try to interact so I don't totally lose the relation, but they usually take offense (or we drift apart) at my avoidance or my inability to stir up enthusiasm or genuine interest. I wonder how many people have done this to me as well. If I believe something to be purposeful or meaningful, I can turn it all around and become everything I'm normally not - as long as I don't feel trapped. It's not very common for me to meet anyone who brings me enough pleasure to make me want to interact regularly with. I lack a certain level of emotional intelligence; however, I've been learning the last while that my empathy is still disturbingly intact - at least in regards to some populations. It must have just gone into a coma for half a decade or so, but is still alive. I'm understanding the meal analogy to mean that sometimes it's about convenience rather than quality. For me, it's the opposite (I think). If my environment doesn't trigger the mood/emotions I 
need, I go off into my own world to find them. Sometimes it serves as a ""jump start"" if I'm hitting a depression. More like treating a nutrient deficiency. Sounds bad. I don't have this. I experience the odd beliefs (and now learning not magical thinking very often). I'm also not a stranger to ideas of reference. I found that some of the most problematic symptoms I've experienced were full fledged delusions. Largely, because you can't hide them. They were harder to handle than visual ""perceptual disturbances"" I've decided, when at all possible, it's best to avoid picking up diagnoses (and the resulting prescriptions) - and, instead, manage my symptoms on my own (or my psychologist assisting with coping skills)."

So here's how it went down My husband would not tell me how to respond and so they called family members we are estranged from and they are bringing her to them on Sunday! Let no moss grow. Found out because he called his mom as usual on Mondays and she asked did his sister call me this weekend? Because they say she's not happy living there anymore and needs a vacation and she doesn't know why they say that but she is leaving Sunday to go to her granddaughter's house and he tells her they are a-holes and that I didn't get a call but a text and he worked ALL weekend and didn't get to talk about it and you know she just went to the bank on Saturday to close out sons account as if IM the one who couldn't have handled having her here and I feel like a piece of garbage for not texting something but it had to come from him and I would have taken her in a heart beat except I was worrying about if he could deal with it. It's OK. I have resigned my

Or why apparently he's blaming you for ""setting him back several days"" Guess a few days in this world (online and in life) is nothing. Normally its months! If you know what I mean. You're obviously struggling for which I'm so sorry. Is there anyone that you can talk to outside of your family or someone that you trust. Why is your mother calling you a drama queen? And yelling at you for being low. I don't like the sound of that but I've also had that. Millions of people will just not get depression etc. Its SO HARD for them to understand. I know this is your first post but you can feel safe telling us what mental health problems you have. Just so we can understand. Maybe put them in your bio but don't feel pressurised ?please. Its only so we can get to know you and understand you that's all and tell you how we deal with our problems. I hope that makes sen
se . I say things on here that I don't say anywhere else. You can always request to be a friend of a member and send messages totally privately. When you see you have things in common its easier for you to share and unload all that you are going through. I've never been judged nor do I judge anyone. I hope others do the same for me. If anything I hope to find support, much needed support, when the members on here really get what we're on about. That's a huge help. Even thou I seem to be the only ??Irish woman all the way accross the ?world on here, just knowing something like this exists can keep me going. You sound like you're having a very tough time without support too. Is getting a counsellor out of the question? People who cut feel a release of emotional distress. Even tho I haven't done that I can understand what can drive you to it and then become a coping strategy. My ex's granddaughter who was very young had terribly deep numerous cuts all over her. I would spend time talking to her for ages, and jus
t listening. And attending to her cuts which were bad. It was from her upbringing, my ex's daughter whom I cared about too but when partner and her caused that child mental anguish. We said years ago ""god help that poor child when she grows up"" we were worried and rightly so as it turned out. Hope you can post again. And let us know what's going on. I keep saying us but that's to let you know that we are all here for you. I am. Take care of yourself sweetie ????????"

It has a ton of fiber in it so I'm optimistic. I already take a very good multivitamin too. You should see how many meds i take with my dinner. It's literally a handful.

175977366,"Hi and welcone. Each med os different for each person. Lexapro can cause some bitter side effects at first but is generally a great go to med for anxiety and combined depression. Actually it is possible that you will need a bit of time for it to kick...lexapro is more fast acting in the main however. 6 to eight weeks will determine if it is suitable for you. The lyme...bugger... With the lexapro you may need to increase....but give it some time and keep talking with ya doc. Side effects are with any meds...lexapro no different. It is known as very effective if ya brain handles it. You got some wriggle room with ya dose, so keep it mind. Our brain needs to adjust to the medication...nausua is par for the course with a new med. If symptoms are not lyme related and they persist and or worsen consult ya doc. Keep strong. HT"

The total for each lunch would cost me $30 bucks each time. Basically I was lacking self-control in this instance. A friend's wife noticed I lost weight too, that was really nice of her to say it. I've been thinking of dating again. I talked about it with my psychologist a couple weeks ago. It's been a while since I've even put effort into chasing after love. The last woman I dated was _NAME_, and that was... god 4 years ago I think. I was on an antidepressant and I just wasn't myself, will I ever be myself again though?

175977374,"Recently, I was evacuated from Wuhan, China where the Corona virus hit the most. I stayed there for more than 30 days inside my room isolated from the world which was one of the requirements of the university as a safety measure. I could not go out of the dormitory in no case whatsoever. This really took a huge mental tole. I developed severe anxiety and had panic attacks. I did not know that those were panic attacks at that time and i thought i was dying. I had no symptoms of the coronavirus but I seriously believed that I was dying. Although i was made sure that we were safe i would not believe it. After about 30 days, our country made arrangements to evacuate us from Wuhan. It was really hell on earth to travel back home especially because the day we had to leave, it snowed really heavy. We had to walk with our luggage for about an hour in the snow to reach the university gate. Took us around 10 hours to carry out procedures in the airport as well. But with god's grace all of us came back safety 
to our country. But then again we were put in 14 days quarantine in a facility created for us. Now i am back home after numerous tests from the government proving we are free from the virus but still I went to the clinic and did my own tests. Still everything was fine. I had no problems but still I feel i am not well. After finding out from the doctor and being diagnosed with panic disorder and anxiety, my pulse rate is really high. The doctor did not prescribe me with any medication for my anxiety because she said i'm still young and the medication might create an addiction. I am coping with my anxiety on my own and finding out ways to deal with it. I have headaches on the right side of my head when i feel i'm being tensed and i feel pressure in my body. I have developed gastritis and taking medication for it. I have supportive parents and they are guiding me through it. But I do not feel like myself, at around 4-5pm in the evening, i start to have very negative thoughts which i cannot control. I develop irr
ational thoughts which i know are stupid but at that moment i feel they might come true. Please help. I need someone to talk to about it. I feel like i cannot talk to my parents about it even though i know they are supportive."

175977378,"*mod _USER_ID_* Note Dr. Stone didn't say the majority were loners, let alone all of them: he said half were. In debunking the myth that all serial killers are loners, the FBI's affirmation that the majority of serial killers are not loners doesn't seem to conflict with _PERSON_: indeed half is not a majority. But if instead the FBI really meant that loners are less than half, the difference of views could be explained by a difference in degrees: ""loners with mostly schizoid traits"" versus dysfunctional ""reclusive, social misfits who live alone"". For instance, _NAME_ is a poster child for the sadistic schizoid psychopath serial killer, but he lived with him mom... We're not talking about sexual activity per se but torture. If you don't know the difference between the two, I wouldn't want to have sex with you. But if you insist on assimilating torture to sex just because some people are sexually aroused by it, then it would be the most extreme form of sex imaginable; and if a killer needs to tor
ture to really get his rocks off, I think it speaks of a profound inability to feel pleasure, even through sex, which is congruent with the ""has little, if any, interest in having sex"" criterion. Anyway, you only need to meet four criteria to be properly considered schizoid, let alone a loner, so your point is moot. Correct. Correlation with paraphilias increases as we move up the Scale. It's all rational. He looks at the crime, but also the perpetrator. In short, the more the killer is rational and free from mental illness and the more the crime is cooly premeditated and involving prolonged torture, the higher a person is ranked on the scale. Both exist. You can be sadistic without sexual excitement. Ever heard ""sadistic glee""? The apparent source of our disagreement and the problem I see with your approach is that you seem to forget that the DSM and the PCL-R are only imperfect tools. _PERSON_ himself talks about ""white collar/successful"" psychopaths. These people wouldn't meet the criteria for psycho
pathy, or even ASPD, but they are psychopaths nonetheless, like the so-called Angels of Death. Sure, for practical and research purposes it's advantageous to use those diagnostic instruments, but in the present context, clinical judgment has precedence; and since the hallmark of those disorders is callousness, it makes sense that serial murder would be more than enough to warrant the ""antisocial"" label. I agree there could be some exceptions though: a good prospect is schizoid _NAME_. It begs the question: are there any monsters at all? But I get what you mean. Yes, some of the highest ranking serial killers were charming and led double lives. The ""monsters"" are those who are not approachable in conversation and seem to be evil all the time. LOL, I know Wikipedia believe that too, but _PERSON_ name literally appears under the definition of the schizoid serial killer. Perhaps it's possible to be both Schizoid and Borderline. It's related to Borderline Personality Organization in general - therefore schizoi
d - of which polymorphous perverse sexuality is a symptom. Don't assume my lack of response is proof of anything. As it happens, I just don't know. Imagine that. If you don't bother to do any reading or watch some episodes of Most Evil, don't blame him when you run into misconceptions. Cordially."

175977435,"Minipuff: You said for years you have been on 60 mg of Prozac, which treats depression as well as anxiety. But you are still having anxiety and anxiety attacks. He might not be willing to take you off that because you might not go on a new medicine. Which brings us back to: Buspar, anti-anxiety. Try the Buspar and if after a time if it doesn’t work, give him a chance to increase it. From the things you listed in your last post which upset you, you should get down on your knees and thank the heavens above that anti-anxiety medicine even exists. Try the Buspar and then at increased dosages, and if doesn't work maybe ask him about new medicine. Also, you said in your latest post, “If things don't move at my pace, and my pace is very fast, then I get agitated.” So panic attacks is not the only issue. Looking at some of the experiences you’ve had, you need more anxiety medicine. I think your doctor is maxing out on the Prozac and you’re still having anxiety issues, so he’s giving you a secon
d anxiety medicine. You are really, out the widow. I remember when I first took Lithium stabilizer for biopolar, with the 1st pill, I felt like a 100 pound weight had been lifted off of my shoulders, the release of tension was so great. I didn’t know I had been walking around acting like an idiot, snapping off at a lot of people. I thought the other people were in the wrong to cause me to be angry. But you won’t take the next anxiety medicine because of your medicine phobia. Still, the ball is in your court. A possible solution is laid out in front of you, but you won’t take the medicine. And you're looking around for solutions and who's causing the problem. You said you have an appt. with your psy. tomorrow Wed. and noted, “So I will talk to him then about my fears.” That would be good. Mayoclinic.org said about phobias, they can be helped by: 1.Psychotherapy, which you’ll be doing tomorrow. 2. Exposure therapy, which, “if you're afraid of elevators, your therapy may progress from simply thinki
ng about getting into an elevator, to looking at pictures of elevators, to going near an elevator, to stepping into an elevator. Next, you may take a one-floor ride, then ride several floors, and then ride in a crowded elevator.” How about as a baby step to taking your medicine, you take a vitamin pill? 3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). What helped me with a lot of my problems was positive thinking, in that a column I read said that before going into a problem believe that you can solve it. Again, before even thinking about the problem, I first had to believe that I could solve it, which flipped my unconscious to positive and looking for solutions. If my unconscious is on negative (and my conscious is set on positive), I look for defeat, or half win, half loss. So, rather than open the door (which my uncon. says might be locked), I dive out of a plate glass window to get out of a burning building, which is half win, half loss, to satisfy both parts of my brain. I then check the door, and it was open th
e entire time. So, now I say, “Think positive, think positive, think positive” before I even think about the problem, so my uncon. will be looking for solutions. As for sleep, Melatonin from health food store. Ask your doctor about that."

175977439,"Hello. I just joined this community and I know that your post was a little bit ago, but I just want to echo what the other two members said. Finding the right therapist is key. I went through several before I finally found the right one. I would suggest that in your search, you look for a therapist that is trained to deal with PTSD. I happened upon an excellent therapist trained in PTSD and she was the one that told me to ask those questions if I am suggesting therapy to anyone else. For me, she worked through EMDR therapy and that was the solution that I was longing for. It took me a while before I got to that point and I did a ton of work during my time with her, but it was amazing. I would be happy to discuss further with you any time that you have questions. Just know that happiness is not a luxury meant for others. You deserve that too. Just be kind to yourself. It is hard to work through all of the painful emotional scars.

I don't know about you guys, but with my paranoid anxiety coming back after this change and the introduction to a new relationship, I have really had to rely on creating a routine. Does anyone else find that creating a routine has helped them? If so, what do you do? I make sure to wash my face to feel good about myself, make a healthy breakfast with toast, read some scripture, work a little bit, and then do something for myself like bake or craft."

175977472,"[/b] Had I known this years ago, I could have saved a lot of time even trying to accomplish success ( by society's standards) Ha. My idea of status and wealth is so skewered that I barely noticed that. Now that I have, it's pretty disgusting, assuming they mean it literally, which I assume they do. The rest of the article seems so to have been culled from various other sources. I got _NAME_ reading it. But that's Wikipedia for ya. I do. What choice do I have? That points to the essence of the sickness of the wealthy; I'd say most billionaires, after achieving the wealth they've strived for (or inherited, but that's a different story, and a much more pathetic one), find themselves with unlimited wealth but nothing to do with it. The money becomes a means to an end. They've realized their goals but fail to see how empty those goals were. So they buy islands and football teams and elevators for their cars to reinforce and advertise the fact that they're wealthy. They hold their noses high not out of a
rrogance but to escape the odor of the rot inside them. Money does change things. If I came into a billion dollars, I'd kiss it goodnight and take it out to breakfast in the morning. Oops. I mean, if I acquired great wealth, I'm sure it would alter my moral compass. _NAME_ has the power to stop world hunger but instead he cuts his employees benefits. I'm betting he was a different man before he became what he is today. I wasn't necessarily talking about great success. Just the ability to realize my creative passions. Besides, my output would probably not garner mass appeal. There are plenty of artists I admire and aspire to that aren't rich and famous. I have a friend who's a moderately successful artist and he doesn't suffer any of the pitfalls of fame. He just enjoys his success. Maybe I misinterpret what it is to be schizoid, but I find it funny that the words apathy and avolition are only mentioned once in that article. I suppose it's safe to say that society is a failed experiment."

175977476,I feel work anxiety again this morning. My mind is racing again and it’s hard to focus. Fffff. I’m so sick of this.
175977477,"When I look at the different eyes, I get a high emotional reaction and then I look at the words.. Although I was never good at multiple choice.. Emotional reaction like ""Yeah man.. Know.. I know.."" for suspiciousness or.. forget which emotion that was or a woman like ""Really now? XP (;"" for confidence or ""Yeah (;"" for flirtation.. Idk just people hit on me and I don't like it but it's a harmless thing. I never really look at people in the eyes when talking because the fact that other people can't jinxes it and I think about it so much. But when I'm not paying attention to that jinx, I'm looking people right in the eyes until I realize that jinx again. Then I look at the mouth because I have bad comprehension when people are talking to me while thinking that and continue because I'm so interested in having conversations. I like reading lips while looking at the eyes from below. I told my therapist that when people think I have autism, they act a certain way towards me and try to manipulate me 
to act weird so it jinxes the whole thing! It's better to just forget the label and be social weird self. #Half aspie"

175977478,"I have been struggling for years, physically, mentally and emotionally. Not being religious, I’ve always felt connected to God though and have relied on answered prayers to guide me. I’ve decided I can no longer live in a marriage where I feel no love or support and yesterday was the first time the D word was discussed. Basically, it was me doing all the discussing, and deciding I couldn’t continue if my husband was unwilling to show he cared. Now, I’m devastated. I’m wishing it was a bad dream and I want to wake up and be happy! Please someone, I just need some perspective."

175977480,"There have been some mixed signals as well. Not only did she hint at a crush at one point, she also constantly posts about how she's hard to love (her depression). And that if a woman is worth it, it won't be easy. And how a man needs to keep trying if they think a woman is worth it. She also comes from a more conservative upbringing, where the woman is not supposed to appear too eager, and the man is supposed to pursue. This isn't the first time she's gotten close, then suddenly backed off. It's been a running theme these last few months. She gets closer, veers off and goes into depressive mode, freezing me out. Then she comes back and gets a bit closer. That was actually my doctors point with stepping back, give us a chance to build more trust in each other. And that she may be afraid that she will hurt me. That I should stop pushing the boundaries and let her remove them if/when she's ready. I'm just afraid that I took a step too far. And that I may be the one triggering her depression. The anxi
ety just keeps pushing me to stay close, because I'm afraid of being abandoned and forgotten. It's much worse right now because of the state the world is in. And also not knowing when a boundary is down. I am considering talking to my doctor about going on meds for a while. When it was just affecting me it was one thing. The feelings I feel are a me thing, not something she has done to me. I am incredibly sensitive, I would be like this in any relationship. And the highs more than make up for the lows. Also, I've never really agreed with the whole friendzone concept. It's a product of our instant gratification and hookup culture. The best relationships are built on a foundation on friendship. You can't force feelings, but you can plant the seed and see if they will grow. While I know a lot of people believe in it, the once a friend always a friend idea is wrong."
175977481,"My marriage is going to end tomorrow. My mate doesn't know it, but the new doctor she's been referred to is also a behavioral medicine specialist, and her psychosis will be high on the agenda. I loathe being dishonest with her, but I can't think of any other way to get her in the car and into the doctor's office. I strongly suspect that she'll see it as an unforgivable betrayal, but I'm completely out of ideas, much less options, to help her."

I like this job but the review process is anxiety provoking. But, so far nobody else has complained yet. I have not heard from the head of the school yet. I will wait for a week then give it up. I could ask other schools but realize they are all about the same. I hope to hear from him. I am tired as usual. I slept most of the day after doing my morning shift. I have to teach tonight too. I am doing well otherwise. I took my medication in the morning. I feel ok."

I think I'll be applying this sort of philosophy to my life - And as I said, a big change will happen in my life I believe. Staying up until the AM's always gives me Nirvana - No one would believe me though.. Just like that time I thought I figured out the meaning to the universe and I thought that no one would believe me. The deepest fundamental secret that you need to know is that, - ""For every outside, there is an inside"".. Anyways Imma sleep. I will lift you all up in your deepest miseries!.. No. I can't do that.. But I'm here for you all with the power of the Gods (If you believe in them).. Satan helps to make things fun sometimes so remember that.. Gnight =] Tomorrow for you all may be good or bad - But remember, the bad days prepare you for good days... And I can't believe how much my symptoms are basically non-existent.. Eve

Haven't really gotten into any FB arguments myself. But I stay away from politics and anything that seems controversial. I need FB to watch my Religious Study class on Sunday mornings and my Church services Sunday mornings. Soon we might be going to outside Church but right now it is still online via Facebook live and Facebook.

175977490,"Sorry falcon, I know you've been waiting patiently to start the new med"
175977491,That's a good way of saying one of the main things I've been complaining about here.. Like not being able to wake up without a stimulant.. It's really horrifying because we have things that we want/need to do but too tired to do it. 8 hours awake and the brain hasn't fully woken up yet.. That's what I'm going to say to my doctor.. Is this because of antipsychotics for you? I started stimulants after my first antipsychotic so maybe I'm just still exhausted from them - 8 years later..

175977503,"My son is 27 yrs old. He was diagnosed at 10 yrs of age with Pediatric Bipolar Disorder, ADD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Impulse Control Disorder. Now we believe a more accurate diagnosis is probably Borderline Personality Disorder. He started seeing a therapist in April, but I don't think he is getting specialized treatment. No CBT, nothing specific to BPD. He obsesses about not having friends, but no one ever lives up to his expectations. He is severely depressed. When I suggest anything to help, he insists he's done it and it doesn't help. But if he has tried anything, it was for a week tops. He hates humanity, but craves friendships/relationships. He literally wallows in his own self pity. He wants more money (he gets disability) but has excuse after excuse about why he can't work. He has physical pain from a mildly herniated disc and mild degenerative disc disease but he makes the pain worse with his thinking causing himself stress/anxiety that exaserbates the pain. I am at my wit's end
. He keeps saying he just wants to die, today he talked about slitting his wrists. He has a 2 yr old who needs him. I keep trying to convince him he needs to retrain his brain to think differently. From what I understand, there is therapy designed for this. Does anyone have any suggestions please? Thank you for any help"

I had less ideas on average. I had a much stronger sense of time pressure for the project rather than my usual sense of enthusiasm. I would rush through creative tasks such as sketching and brainstorming , not slowing down to enjoy them. I found myself using Facebook more when I would have usually been working, I think this was to fill a mental ‘boredom’ void of some kind.""

Once again, studying DBT made me anxious because it brought back so many memories of past delusional states i've been in plus some bad memories of a place I used to live. It's understandable and I practice DBT to calm myself from the anxiety that reading about DBT can cause. I know that sounds weird that I would study this stuff even though it makes me anxious but the skills I'm learning are so helpful, it's worth it--they are helpful for the triggers when I'm not reading about DBT.

175977536,"HUGS newtus. What kind of coping skills do you have set up to deal with the anxiety? Do you take medication for anxiety? If not, can your pdoc give you some? How about yoga and meditation? Puzzles are supposed to be good for anxiety. Old fashioned jigsaw kind of puzzles. Something about sorting the pieces. Very soothing. Of course I find them downright irritating because I can't figure them out but they are supposed to be soothing. Also like scents like lavender and stuff might help. Praying helps me. Don't know if you are religious. But if not, you might be able to find a saying that you can say over and over that would help. The serenity prayer is a good one. _PERSON_"

This helps a lot. I sleep well too. Exercising has helped me to gain more stamina. Before, I was really tired all of the time. Now, I feel more invigorated. My only vice is I like a man who is far away. He may come to visit me. I am not sure he can due to covid-19 though. May be later in the year, he will come."
175977557,I'm starting to like low THC/high CBD weed. I might smoke some and look up psychedelic stocks again. Taking 30mg of Vyvanse in the morning and 30mg at noon is way better than taking 60mg in the morning - So I'll keep doing that. I'm in a good state of mind. Might read after idk.. I hope I get to work on the weekends again to make extra money. My panic attacks seem to be completely gone.
175977558,"Slept a bit But feeling emotional Remembering the time like a year ago when I got locked out of my car because my key fobs died, and I was still kinda new living in this area. I had 2 different random white men come up to me and I was scared they were going to hurt me. But they helped me get into my car. One of them happen to work at the _NAME_ dealership which is the make of my car and I couldn’t be more grateful."

175977563,"Good morning everyone. Hope you're all well. Having anxiety attacks for the first time ever at age 55. I have undetermined-autoimmune-disease (began same time, diagnosed with Lyme). Had to see a new dr last week. The waiting room was small & there were 5 or 6 other patients & the drs exam office looked like, a converted broom closet(no joke). 1st app. I was in there for 1/2 hour. Was shocked to watch dr, cover her mouth, to conceal a croupy cough. Was given a prescription for, 1 week supply of medicine to try. Went to walmart pharmacy. Pharmacist said script was written wrong & sent me back to drs office. Returned to walmart where pharmacist said he only had 4 days worth, I'd need to return in 3 days. I asked him twice & he said, 3 days, return. I returned & he then said my insurance wouldn't pay until the next day-come back! He became irate when I told him, he'd told me to return in 3 days. Told me I was putting 'words in his mouth' and do i want to switch pharmacies? He said he'd text me when rea
dy but never did. I told him, I was afraid to keep coming out because of autoimmune status & caring for elderly parents. He & another walmart pharma staff said, ""Well we have to be out here and we have elderly parents too"". I left in tears then had to return again, yesterday for the remaining couple days of meds. 4 trips to pharmacy for 7 days worth of drugs. Now this new dr insists on meeting on Zoom app by smartphone. I have no smartphone. Then read of the situation where countless people have been exposed and humiliated by Zoom showing their private chats online for everyone to see! Been having terrible nightmares, am shaking, pacing & chain smoking- can't eat. The pain in my neck, head and spine is nearly unbearable. Having a difficult time swallowing.... Taking Ashwaganda, praying and pretending to feel okay. It's so painful, to see what our lives have become. Those who're designated to care for us have so much power and so little compassion. Should we feel great danger from our healthcare system?- And 
now walmart has only ONE door- farthest from the pharmacy- that is open! The store's big, overcrowded, people are downright nuts and there's only 1 door, to get in and out. The anxiety this is causing is literally rendering me stupid,stuck & sick. Had to vent & get it out. Thanks for listening if anyone sees this!"
174371627,"I went to my new psychiatrist again today, as my anxiety and depression are getting worse. She recommended adding abilify to my lexapro, or switching to cymbalta. I don't really want to take the abilify, because I don't think my lexapro is working, so why continue to take it. Now, reading about cymbalta, I am scared to try it. Anyone have any luck with cymbalta?"
175977564,"Slept all last night and took a nap earlier, still on the verge of falling asleep"
175977565,"I'm in so much mental pain. I'm willing to go through 100x more pain in order to get better but I don't know what to do. I have no direction. I want to stop my antipsychotic injection. I tried lowering it last year and felt good for like 6 months but then threatened someone with a plastic shovel? I just get so damn agitated. My main complaint when I was 16 to the first doctor I saw was ""agitation"" and ""depression"". Nothing has changed. I'm starting to get annoyed - People telling me ""Try this"", ""that"". I'm traumatized by my ex step dad telling me what to do - And never having my own life. All I did as a teenager was school, work and sleep. Once I had a fight with my ex step dad and my mom kicked him out, she neglected me for him. It's the same thing now - I have to take care of her when she's drunk and she has asshole bf after asshole bf. I don't know what to do with the information in my head - I'm not happy now and what are antipsychotics doing at this point? Numbing my mind so I'm compli
ant. I don't want a relationship - Maybe if I could feel some emotions like a normal person. I go into phases where I'm hostile and others where I'm completely harmless. It's like the in and out of insight. I thought about having a panic attack on purpose because it feels painful and I want to feel pain. Sorry if this is too much. I'm fine. My doctor is going to question me about wanting to switch back to Vyvanse. He's fed up with me always changing my mind on the stimulant medication - I think higher doses work like an antipsychotic for me. There will be more walls of text depending on how low the Invega Trinza drops in my blood over the next ~5 or so weeks. I have no idea what's going to happen - Hopefully I'll be more creative. I'm not taking phenibut anymore cuz if I take more, I'll be too dependent."

175977571,My mom went for the hike without me cuz I was sleeping. Now she's sleeping on the couch lol..
175977572,Craving Cheetos. Getting some tomorrow when I go grocery shopping. My sister is coming over this weekend to visit. We're having coffee and those Danish butter cookies that come in the blue tin. Trying to focus to read my book but having a hard time.
175977573,Ah I see. I used to abuse the weekend calling privileges anyway for my psychiatrist.
175977574,I don’t do it either. I mainly focus on my diet. I’m not a healthy eater 24/7. But I am like 5 out of 7 days of the week.
175977575,Feeling a bit better right now. I haven't taken any Xanax yet and there's no demons. I talked a lot with my Pastor's wife. That helped. And work should be less stressful today.
175977576,"I had a really good T session last night. She took my suicidal thoughts seriously. We had previously had a pact where if I was going to commit suicide I had to call her first. She upped the ante and said not only did I have to call her but we had to meet and she had to give her approval. Yeah, I seriously doubt she'll give her approval, but I figure if I do the first two, then I am doing all I can do. She said she would be upset (or something) if I were to commit suicide and it was the first time I ever really felt cared about by her. I am still feeling some of that caring today. It's kind of nice. We talked about angels and demons and some of my hallucinations. She didn't have much to say about that except that maybe I was tuned into a world that is between this one and the next one (not sure I believe that as it doesn't jive with my religious beliefs, but I just let her talk). She wants to know what causes the suicidal thoughts. Beyond this unrelenting depression, IDK. My PDOC doesn't know either
. They just happen for me. I feel a little more hope today. I also told a coworker in the NY office (I'm in CA) that I'm struggling with depression and that's why my focus hasn't been so good. She was really great about it. She told me not to be hard on myself and that she would never judge me for that, and the couple of details that I missed on some stuff we can fix and that she would help me. I feel good about all of that. I'm on a learning curve and doubtless there will be some things that I am going to miss, but I tend to be hard on myself. I was able to tell my coworker on email too so that helped. She was really gracious about it and she told me I'm doing a good job which made me feel better. I am feeling a tiny bit better today. I think it was the T session more than the supplements. I'm really tired though because I took some anti-anxiety medication this morning because my anxiety at work went sky high. I wasn't anxious until I got to work and then I was super anxious. But now I'm to the part where I'
m just tired and sleepy. I'm getting my work done today but I'm also trying to relax and not just be putting out fires but actually doing what I need to get done. I'm glad my T took me seriously. And I see her next week so I am glad it is not a long time between visits. Usually it is two or three weeks, but this time it was back to back and I'm pleased about that. It's nice to have a little breathing room today where I'm not being pounded by the suicidal thoughts. I was pretty blunt with her last night and so I think that helped her to take me seriously. HUGS to all, _PERSON_"

175977588,"My T wanted me to come up with a ritual for the ending of a bad habit/addiction that I haven't indulged in in almost 9 months. So since I am of Judeo/Christian background, the only thing I could think of was getting some anointing oil and a white candle. Amazon delivered the anointing oil late last night, so I found it by my mailbox this morning. I did a sort of ceremony with placing crosses on my wrists, forearms near the elbows and my forehead with the anointing oil while having the candle lit and saying a prayer/reciting some scripture. She said I might have to go through the ritual many times before it feels complete. So far I don't know how I feel. I thought I might feel different somehow, cleansed, renewed but I don't. Maybe that is why she said it might take many times to go through it."

I need to start finding ways to occupy time. I did have a job but I put my status to inactive on there because I was having trouble making it to work. I think I can have meaning in my life; it will just take some effort on my part to find. I was also thinking back to when I was not ill, and I thought that I was a pretty confident kid. I guess this is strange because that's like the opposite of what I am now. But it kind of gave me some hope to think back to that kid who was pretty confident in himself."

175977607,Unless they were ignoring every single of your text I’d say not to take it personally. I’m one of those people who sometime don’t reply to a text for a few weeks because I don’t feel like socializing. I’m an introvert most of time but in a social setting you might think I’m an extrovert due to how good I make others feel comfortable. Little do they know after I did that I’d be retreating to my inner world for days to recharge my battery. Even the fun social interaction reduces my battery.
175977608,"OF, surely your pcp has another dr filling in for him, it would be negligent not to have someone covering his practice. Also, many drs are doing telemedicine appts even with new patients. This past year my husband's pcp put him on Citalopram for depression & anxiety. He started at 20mg & bumped him to 40mg a month later. I knew he was depressed but had no idea how much anxiety was as much of an issue. I can't begin to tell you the difference this made for him. He had back surgery in October & if it weren't for his depression & anxiety being under control it would have never happened. He has done very well since surgery. He's turning 76 this month, not exactly a spring chick. If I remember right you take Cymbalta which really does nothing for anxiety. Try to talk to a dr about putting you on a medication that works for both issues. I took Buspar several years ago & did well with it. I would call the pcp's office Monday & ask who is handling the drs patients. If nothing else, look for another pcp, bu

175977631,"Minipuff: I just looked at the side effects for Buspar and webmd.com said on the outside of the website: 1. Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, nervousness, lightheadedness, restlessness, blurred vision, tiredness, and trouble sleeping may occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly. ""trouble sleeping can occur."" So this would coincide with what you said you had, or trouble sleeping. On the inside of the same website, it said: 2. This medication is used to treat anxiety. It may help you think more clearly, relax, worry less, and take part in everyday life. It may also help you to feel less jittery and irritable, and may control symptoms such as trouble sleeping, sweating, and pounding heartbeat. Buspirone is a medication for anxiety (anxiolytic) that works by affecting certain natural substances in the brain (neurotransmitters). or ""may control symptoms such as trouble sleeping."" Somewhat conflicting, but I guess either could occur. In the fi
rst item above it adds: ""If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly."" I take Melatonin for sleep. You can also ask you doctor or pharmacist if Melatonin is OK with the medicines you are taking. I also use a heating pad on low to help me go to sleep sometimes. I take the Melatonin an hour or two before going to bed so it can be in full effect. 12"

I even slept most of the night past 3 nights but still slept during the day a bit. He doesn’t understand that it’s my meds. I wake up and take my meds and feel sleepy again. Like very very sleepy. When I’m tired I get dissociative-like. You know? The typical, I’m so tired I can’t do a thing, but that plus feeling severely out of it. Like I’m trying to work against the medicine. As if I was working against a sleep aid. I mean I’m assuming it the meds. They at least have partly to do with me sleeping during the day. Vraylar kept me awake at 1.5 mg but once I got on 3mg I got tired. And I think Zoloft doesn’t help at all to stay awake either! Just made me feel extremely awful.

We have to blindly look for it like everyone else.. live life.. Then we die happy. Or we can die psychotic. Who knows. All the creativity, the genius.. Sparks of psychosis coming through.. But not when completely knowing the paradox... I got my hand and cut a line through reality, said ""Enough! I want to go back to sanity. To not knowing what I know.

My mom now uses my illness against me, controls me and still continues to neglect me. She has cancer. She has a severe heart condition. But she said to my dad, ""I know what I did was wrong and if I die, I want you to know that I'm sorry"".. He said ""Yeah yeah don't worry about it"". She keeps saying that she's a bad mother and makes me feel sorry for her. I love her unconditionally and always will so I don't know why she says that. I said not too long ago, ""Mom I'm worried about you - I don't want you to drink too much so that I'll have to take care of you tonight"" and she said (While pouring a drink) ""Well I might do it anyways"".

175977677,Hi I need ideas and suggestions how to help my wife when she is going through a rough time
175977678,"I’m so sorry to hear about your struggles. Definitely seek professional help from a psychiatrist and/or therapist. I’ve been having issues for 30 years, with highs and lows. I’ve been on so many different meds, but it’s a trial and error process. A therapist will help you find ways to cope. Getting set up with good coping skills I think I a key component. Please don’t put yourself down or think you are crazy. These are chemical imbalances within our brain and we have no control over them. Unfortunately, it is a sickness just like diabetes, high cholesterol or even cancer. Don’t give up!!! I found over the years some coping skills that have helped me is journaling, in the moment remember to breathe, close your eyes and breathe, remember you are a good strong person and nothing is going to take that away from you! Have a cup of tea, read a “no-nonsense” book that you don’t even care what the title it. Get lots of rest and sleep, even if you have to go to bed extra early. Lack of sle
ep is your worst enemy. You are a very special person and are not alone by any means. Like I said, I’ve been suffering from anxiety and depression for 30 years and right now I’m at an all time low, but I’m going to fight back with everything I got. God bless and good luck to you!"

I was aware of what was happening, but I couldn't control it. I hope this explanation helps. Good luck, friend. I would check with your doctor soon."

Yet it must be done cleanly, with clear intention for the outcome not to get twisted/ warped into something else. I ask myself What’s your intention. What’s your fear. Then I Ask for my angels and guides to help with clarity. What would you want her to say to you in the same scenario.

175977710,"Sd77_Butterfly2 I see that you have just joined us so | want to say ""Welcome to Inspire"" I am glad you came here for you definitely need support from a ""family"", and one is available here. I invite you to come often, make friends, and feel free to express your concerns at any time. Depression is a common complaint around here, and most especially since 2020 rolled in, with it's compounded problems. We will discuss depression with you, but first, I would like to explore the reason you mentioned ""pain"". Does your boyfriend have a specific diagnosis regarding a pain producing illness? If the answer to that is yes, does he have a doctor who is monitoring that condition, and....if so, has his medication for it been re-examined recently. The main reason I ask is...if he has a lot of physical pain, and it IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY TREATED, THEN THAT COULD BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DEPRESSION. Constant and unrelenting pain...all by itself, can cause depression."
175977711,I was off meds completely for about two years before I started to have psychosis again. My moods were pretty stable until they weren’t.
175977712,"Hey, _NAME_, so sorry you are struggling. Sounds rough. Speaking as someone who has dealt with bipolar 1 for decades, much of what you describe is pretty much a trip down memory lane. It mostly sounds quite familiar. Lots of folks have highly specific and detailed delusions. If this is psychosis, it can sometimes take a few weeks to abate with the meds, so, patience is a virtue. As far as the current state of neuroscience is concerned, no human has been documented to be capable of what you describe. You could always be the first, but it seems unlikely. Good luck."

The powder of sarcosine is slightly sweet so you can add it to like coffee.

175977728,"I used to be a very nervous person. But since then, I've become much more calm. However, when something does makes me nervous for a few minutes these days, it can occasionally get on my nerves. I'm sure it can with you as well, especially if you currently have serious anxiety issues like I used to. But nowadays, when something makes me anxious for a short time, I often succeed at not having it get on my nerves. For example, a few days ago, I was driving my car when I heard an odd noise. I was afraid that something might be wrong with my vehicle. And I hate to have to spend money getting a problem with my car fixed by my mechanic. I'm not a rich person, after all. It turned out that the noise was merely coming from funky pavement on the road that I was driving on that had been patched up fairly recently. No big deal. Nothing I have to worry about. I could have told myself, ""Man, I wish that noise didn't scare me and cause my anxiety for a few minutes!"" Instead, I told myself, ""I'm just glad it tu
rned out to be nothing."" So if something makes you nervous and it turns out to be nothing, you can either tell yourself, ""I wish that hadn't happened!"" Or you can tell yourself, ""I'm just glad it turned out to be nothing."" I suggest going with the latter."

Here I'm pretty much whatever. I'm way more careful on twitter now than I was before where I felt I had to respond to everything. My conscience kicks in when I write a tweet and then stare at it for 10 seconds and delete it most of the time. Twitter has helped my blog, but not my book. I really fumbled the release(s) of my book. I must have updated it on amazon 20 times. I'm so pathetic. A made a friend on Twitter after I read her thesis on delusions and had a back and forth because she's got a phd in philosophy and that was her topic. The advice she gave me was to just stop adding to part one and focus on part two, and 
afterwards, then I can create another ""edition"" down the road. I'm proud of the ending for it now though. Next time I'll sit on the finished book for 6 month and stew on it. Then give it to an editor, correct, and sit on it further."
175977755,"As someone that gets manic or even manic and psychotic when reading a book, my love for books was there, but I couldn't do it. I read all throughout my childhood, and I haven't been able to do it for years. Then, the other day, I tried audio books. My love for books is back. I can listen to a book at work while frying doughnuts, or while hanging with my birds, or while doing household chores. It's so nice. I love it so much. I've been wanting to reread the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I have the books from my childhood (where I read them, like, twenty times), I couldn't. I got manic after four chapters of the Fellowship. Yes yes."
175977756,"Was talking with psychonauts again. I asked for music. One said ""Deftones"". Deftones - Tempest [Official Lyric Video] - YouTube I love this song. Will play games on my phone later to exercise my mind. Maybe I'll sit outside. The sky is grey and yellow like a Call of Duty game."

They just repeat the cycle.. like someone having a baby.. Babies all look the same then they grow up to become miserable adult wageslaves like anyone else. These stupid babbies get showered with love for maybe 17 years tops then its ""you live under my roof get a job why did I ever have you"".. but my parents didn't do that.. It happened to them.. Now what about me? Fear that they die? So I prepare.. It all maybe leads to a tragic end with my declining cognition.. So I'm lucky. But things drive me insane.. all the dehumanizing bitter rules and regulation followers enforcing me to have an eye exam so I get can more contact lenses.. when does the innovation end? It doesn't.

He said, ""I have to write that one down.. never heard of that one b4"".. So not even a professional understand me.. how can the soldiers? War movies annoy me now.. it's not cool to be a solider.. Yet vietnamese forgive.. That's how it should be.. clean up the patriotism and China has to stop having a slavery competition less the Coronavirus speeds that up.. My psychosis is ok considering I didn't take an olanzepine tonight. Still afraid to take seroquel and mirtazepine it will make me fat anyways.."

175977762,Because not having to speak is very relaxing. I would like to take a vow of silence and try it out as a social experiment. I guess it would mean I become unemployable.

Don't you think that his adult personality could have been influenced by his father's beliefs and expectations? 2) Morality aside, I wouldn't teach my son to kill because it's not safe.

I feel apathetic atm cuz I took some kratom. I like the ecstasy of life and adventure. I've felt the most happy when I'm travelling, going to markets, eating good food, experiencing different cultures, learning new things, being with my family..

175977794,Need to send some documents today. US. Immigration. Is. Complicated.
175977795,Phenibut kicked in and I talked to the Greek man. I feel very happy =]
175977796,I just really want to make sure that I don't go into something that I end up regretting.
175977797,When did you see your therapist last? Can you make an appointment?
175977798,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuTfIu7QcJY I literally had to cry to these memories:)
175977799,"Do you think there is a reason your bp was up? Were you running late or did you have a long wait? Sometimes working out can put it up. Did you work out before the health screening? Do you have a way to check it at home? You could check it after various things and see what effects it. Try to eat properly, it helps. I hope you are feeling better. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175977800,Oh ok thanks!
175977801,I get these weird messages of music and information being God talking to me and controlling me and trying to kill me and loved ones. Is it normal to be completely fine yet have this type of **** happen? Idk.. Lately I've been different.

175977807,"I saw _PERSON_ last night and it did a great job at disturbing me. In some ways it felt cathartic, because I could relate to parts of his story... These trigger warnings actually are spoilers Possible trigger: When the joker questions whether he exists, when he asks his social worker if she's listening because all he has are negative thoughts, when people make fun of him because of his job, and also what he wears, when he puts himself out there to try and make something of himself and fails, how the system fails him and he can't afford his meds or see a therapist anymore. Also the environment that _PERSON_ takes place in. The poor versus millionaires/billionaires. I make nickels, when I should be making 1/3 more than I do right now. It's ********. Watching it was so disturbing that I had racing thoughts afterwards until 12am."
175977808,Possible trigger: Voices are telling me to commit suicide. People will be sad in the beginning that I'm just going to be forgotten and they'll get over it they say. They say I'm a no good selfish peace of ****. They say people want me dead and that I'm better off dead. They say I'm not deserving of loving friends and family.

We can't really tell what someone is thinking unless maybe if we know them real well like a sibling. Or someone we have spent a lot of time with. And there are people that act a certain way and think another. There are fake people too. People that play mind games. Which is something that baffles me because living life is hard enough let alone be manipulative. I just don't understand that type of person. I have gotten off track I guess. Thanks for the thread.

175977817,Hi mate. Seems like your processes are pretty fixed....the anxiety is dictating a bit.... Seems like a little randomness may help. We get set in our ways and if they become too set and if other factors like anxiety come into play harder to break from our set ways. I use randomness at times. Still get stuff done. Keep .

174371967,"I have a love/hate relationship with clozapine. It's considered the most effective antipsychotic out there, but you have to get frequent blood work because one of the potential but extremely rare but dangerous side effects is a lowering of your white blood cells. It worked really well for me as in completely got rid of all my psychotic symptoms, but I gained a lot of weight on it and eventually I quit taking it because the pharmacy ****_NAME_ up and I was too paranoid to begin taking it again and switched to Zyprexa. It also was not practical for me (who can't consistently drive to the pharmacy) to get blood work every week and go to the pharmacy the next day, so that's another reason I didn't go back on it. It made me sleep a lot too, but no more than Zyprexa."

Everyone I had left, died, and all I worked hard to achieve like my home and work. It's gone. COPD will take too long. It's been 22 months since my breakdown that followed the unforgiving trauma and loss. 21 months since I started looking for help mostly for bpd but also ptsd, severe major depression and anxiety. 15 months since my attempts started. 1 1/2 months since I lost the last of any hope I had it'll get any better. 3 days since a grief center therapist said she didn't know if they could help me because it's gotten so complicated and I am too low and suicidal. She has to talk to her supervisor first. She called my Dr who prescribes my meds who then called me. Added a strong anti depressant and doubled my anxiety med. Is it ok now? Can I give up or do I have to hear how strong I am? Just because I'm still alive! Cause I'm not. I barely exist. I can't hold in this rage for
ever. I've never felt it that didn't lead me to try and take my life. It's a lonely and scary feeling. And It's the only feeling I can't control once it starts. If even therapists give up on me, is it ok for me to also? Like anything else in life, it can't always work out. Someone always loses."

175977866,I've never tried it but I feel my problems are beyond the scope of psychology. Sometimes I don't even know why I talk to my psychologist. If it cost me more out of pocket I wouldn't bother.
175977867,no but I will tomorrow
175977868,"Went to the Salvation Army for breakfast then to the pharmacy to pick up my meds. Seeing my therapist later today. Lots to talk about. The move, what happened with my cats, the med changes. Also need to discuss budgeting and getting over impulse shopping Today is the first day of tapering off two of the meds, then next Thursday I can begin the zoloft and vraylar. Took a shower, maintenance came over and replaced something. I was just getting out when they came but was able to get my clothes on quickly enough to answer the door lol"
175977869,I treated myself to pumpkin spice creamer by Starbucks from the grocery store.

175977871,That sounds mildly psychotic tbh unless you’re being poetic.....please find out when you can increase your med dose.....
175977872,When is Thanksgiving?
175977873,I screwed up Possible trigger: I binged and purged
175977874,no not today
175977875,"Good morning, it's a rainy day here."
175977876,"I understand not wanting to goto the actual doc for various reasons....it’s never convenient but you can’t expect other people to accommodate problems that can be easily solved with a doctor’s visit if you choose not to go for whatever reason. If you can’t hear, you’re basically giving yourself another disability. Regarding the potential depression...try the pick three technique again. I know you’ve been immersed in VR but that’s still only visual and sound....besides I find tv like entertainment doesn’t really work as one of the three, your mind has to be active in all three dimensions. Missing a week on social media won’t lose your followers, you said the blog was still getting reads and you just posted something anyway. There’s a continuum between productivity and sloth....what you want right now is called relaxation. When you’re depressed its hard to do more than just maintain your basic needs, so doing something for yourself like the pick three is productivity."
175977877,_AT_MENTION_ I hope you feel better soon!
175977878,"Dear _PERSON_, You provide a really good phenomenology of this illness. I wish more people would read your posts and respond to them. Sincerely yours, _PERSON_"

175977882,I want to feel comfort. I'm grateful to be where I am. Everything seems to have stopped... the pain. I don't remember what I was troubled about. I need perspective other than my own.. I need to see the world the way it really is.. Or myself..
175977883,"S.C. I responded back on that thread as well _PERSON_, that is what I’m thinking as well. I’ve never given the generic brand a try which would be better for my bank account. I’m willing to try it out JRF007 I have been on lex brand name at least 4 times in the past. And it has always worked well for me so I’m sure it will work the same for you again. Although each time I start it I always get so nervous to start it. How long have you been on it now?"
175977884,I just bought some herbal coffee. It's like chicory root or something. I think it'll help me not have so much caffeine.
175977885,"All this got me feeling stressed. I have the urge to cut off all my hair, get drunk, and stop taking my meds. But I won’t. I promise."
175977886,My dad is coming over. I hope he brings mufffins. So hungry.
175977887,I'm eager-anxioius to get to my pdoc appointment this week to see what my depakote levels are. I hope they're high so she can lower the dose.
175977888,"You said it's been 2 months since the surgery and that the pain is less than it was. That is good. You also say, ""I still have some pain though. I think cuz I have anxiety so I think about the pain ya."" Didn't you start Lexapro (Escitalopram) a few weeks ago, which net says is for depression and anxiety? Is that working for you? You said you also had some chest pain. Is that still bothering you? I have chest pain from time to time, also. What helps when it is rather mild, is a heating pad. Have you ever tried a heating pad for chest pain? The heat expands the blood vessels, this case, in and around the chest. It allows more nutrients and oxygen to get to the injured area. If my chest pain gets too bad, I have to take an Ativan tranquilizer. I like to read, also. But I also like to see what they're reading on TV, sometimes documentaries about true events. And biographies about people's lives. Last night I watched a docudrama (based on truth) about a racehorse named ""Seabiscuit."" As a child, I re
ad in local history that ""Seabiscuit"" trained for awhile at a horse training center near where I live. That's why I was doubly interested in it and watched every minute of it. Like you, ""Seabiscuit"" was one tough hombre. Give us some updates on how this is going."
175977889,I must have been in semi-sleep paralysis - semi-dream state because I hallucinated an iphone in front of me while I was awake (But I must have still been dreaming) and I was going on all these cool webpages. I could control them. They went from tribal people to black-white shadow ink art. I was telling my sister that I had good hyperphantasia. But it 100% was as vivid as a ****ing iPad. How can my brain visualize so vividly? I put my head on my pillow and songs started playing.. Iron Maiden songs.. And they were loud and realistic.. I hated them. It reminded me of being in the mechanics shop or driving with my ex step dad. Those songs are embedded in my memory because they were played so much. Then this song that I've never heard before played. Idk if it even exists.. But it made me cry..
175977890,"Oooooh no it wasn’t. Let me explain. There was this open thing but it wasn’t a drain, above the drain. Let me see if I can find a pic. It was an old tub. Bugs use to crawl out. Given that there was only one bug every so often, it still freaked me out. Plus at my dads house it was the same but I only took showers. Ugh. Remember that video I made with the scorpions crawling out of my drain? Yea!!! I still have that video! Ugh!"
175977891,Good luck
175977892,"I feel like society wants me to become a very different version of myself than I actually am. Society wants me to become a productive member of people as a subclass. I don't know. I'll perpetually exist in the periphery. I would rather exist this way than become what society wants me to become. I also wish I could become a musician. But at some level, I already am one, and look where that's gotten me. I feel like I am a thinker, that's my allure, if you will. People are telling me conflicting things. You know, like my therapist saying I should have more self-esteem or whatever. I don't get that one. I feel like there's always room to play with people's expectations of us and what society actually expects of us. It's weird to think about, really. I mean, could it be true that everything we've come to believe is actually false? And yet people are always not finding ""meaning"" in life. Not finding purpose or direction. And in some respect, they might have some sense. Though I don't have any perceptio
n on how I am perceived by others. Nor do I have any perception of how others perceive me. And yet it seems like going forward with any sort of ""plan"" in life wouldn't be sufficient. That's why I continue to write. That's why I continue to make stuff up."
175977893,How do you remind yourself that yes you are psychotic vs others overreacting or gas lighting you? I just restarted medication and see a T every 3 weeks.
175977894,"I saw that exact video when it came out too. It's a lot nicer in person than in the photos. The photos don't do it any justice IMO. I still think I'd get the pokemon one, though, if I had to pick. I'm concerned about the joycons, so I think I'll keep the pokemon one as a collector's item unless it's been confirmed that the joycon stick thingies aren't flawed. Oh, and the only thing I don't like about the normal colors of switches is the white joycon stick thingies. They're probably gonna get icky and brown from thumb oil grease, like what happens to the Xbox One controllers. I suppose an easy way to solve that is to put on joycon stick covers, so it's not a huge deal."
175977895,"I had a ""brief"" obsessive psychotic episode last year mostly involving feelings through a person following 1.5 year of no contact and unsolved issue It is possible that i removed a part of the experience from my mind while trying to cope with what happened before and unable to share any feelings about with anyone. One day i saw some updates from him on a social media and i went very alarmed and confused after reading (between the lines) that he had been into some problems and depression -also because of what happened with me -it wasn't explicit at first though-. Like he write short updates, normal things but i understood he had been bad and i had like a sudden epyphany and regret I was so frustated and confused that i vomit twice while crying. i still feel i could have this symptom when i think about though is rare I didn't know what to do and who to talk to, i called a helpline and was not able to explain I was coming out from a period of self isolation and unemployment and possibly ny mental he
alth was really down in that moment because i couldn't realize something in my behaviour I tried to contact him and send confused messages because i felt a desperate need to hear from him He accepted to meet me even if i could feel that he saw that i wasn't mentally ok When we met i was in a catatonic state and it ended with him running away and cutting the contacts again I never found the courage to write to him even if the psychosis climax was over Problem is since i couldn't talk clearly we never had a closure and that was crazy. Never heard from him since them, he blocked me, then unblocked. Silence, fog I should explain more but it's been a nightmare I guess at least now he's forgetting me or moving on, but his life has been damaged, made him lose time This never happened to me in my life before Psychotherapy couldn't help me in time as at first i couldn't reach for it Very bad experience, couldn't fix and also new year started badly I'm praying trying to heal"
175977896,Do u have printer paper?
175977897,That's pretty typical of smokers to blow through them if they buy them in cartons. I thought you two vaped exclusively. Is that now illegal too?
175977898,"The problem with plugs is that, with the noise from the dental drill coming from inside the ear drum, the plugs would increase the sound, for no sound could get out of the ear canal. The noise cancellation technology head set probably wouldn't work because the sound from the drill would get to the ear drum first, then go to the noise cancellation headset. Too late. Also the head set would keep the noise inside the ear. Ordinarily that might work, but I don't think it would in this case. The best combination for me that I've found is, double ear plugs, that look like bubblegum (silicon earplugs, Walgreens, Walmart and net), with non-electric earphones. For plugs with noise cancellation headphones, the electric headphones don't work, because the electronics can't get to the ear drum because of the plugs."

174372085,"I'm gonna try and make another blog except I won't write memory journals on it anymore cuz they can be really dry and boring for people to read. Wordpress offers Ethereum now in advertisement payments. I could study how to make my own website or something. I would talk about a lot of things like investing, mental health, topics on society that I'm interested in like decriminalization of drugs and it's relation to poverty, my family life neuroscience and harm reduction of addiction such as anything addictive including social media, or the conspiring elite, future of physics/mysticism of psychedelics/technology all in relation to my brain and becoming better - Like self improvement, awareness, lessons, quotes.. Someone with schizophrenia-autism that uses psychedelics and stimulants which is quite rare. But yeah my mind is all over the place. There's too much information that I've been blasted with after my trip which makes my consciousness as aware as 99% of people have been their entire life - So I 
have a lot of catching up to do. It seems impossible and it's only logical that I'd break and go completely insane forever. I think I'll have to study philosophy so I'll put that on the list of things to do today or tomorrow. I want to find a way to be optimistic long term and somehow make money."

175030992,"I have dealt with anxiety since I was 8. I deal with social and health anxiety. Just recently I was prescribed with setraline. I've been on it about 2 months. For awhile it's been helping quite well. But I've missed several days. And to make things worse, I'm a WebMD person. Well last week I was scrolling through YouTube and a video came up called My Cancer Journey on the So Fia YouTube channel (rest in peace). I told myself not to watch it, but did anyway. Just to give you a short overview of her story, she had an oestosarcoma relapse, had a lung tumor, and a bladder tumor. Basically she went to this doctor hoping to be in remission, but found the cancer had moved to the rest of her body. Well last night I had an awful dream where my mom got a phone call and was told that I had tumors in my lung and bladder and that the cancer was spreading. In my dream I told everyone I going to die. I remember in my dream I kept asking my mom if it was true and all she said was yes. Well I woke up this morning a
nd was scared because I didn't know if it was real. It got so awful I started bawling in class. I might need to add in to now that I am a very strong Christian believer. I usually pray every night that God would let me have a long and healthy life. I believe that God wouldn't let me die young or get cancer since He knows the fear and pain it causes me. Anyway now, if I have a single pain, I immediately go to it must be cancer. Please please help. I'm so scared to live because of fear that cancer will strike at any known moment. Please someone help. I want to be free of this pain. Please. Thank you to whoever reads this and cares and may God Bless and protect you."
175977902,"Not saying you people should give up hope! Anxiety has never been a thing with me (Generalized Anxiety Disorder). The only time I feel anxiety is when I am dissociating (DP/DR).. The reason I'm never anxious is maybe because I enjoy adrenaline.. The reason that I'm not having dissociation from reality anymore is because I've accepted a philosophy that deems reality to be an illusion.. I have Pure-O OCD and some compulsions.. But sometimes I enjoy thinking and philosophizing.... Being creative.. It's hard to get into this state if you've never been there.. But the main thing is to not take things too seriously as _NAME_ would say.. (Listening to _NAME_ can cause existential dread for me though sometimes). Exhaustion plays a roll. You may be in ""Burnout"" mode. I definitely am - COVID, economy, isolation, etc.. So much fear these days.. Try not to drink as much coffee! Anxiety juice.. Dopaminergic stimulants help me as well. When I can focus, I have no anxiety.. Because then I have the ability to ch
ose to focus on what ever I want. I can even chose to direct my focus away from psychosis idk Very interesting things yet to be discovered in this black hole multiverse of my existence...."

175977909,"Hello, I completely agree with everything that's been said, especially with _PERSON_ advice about controverting your thoughts. I feel like I'm going mad ALL the time. When anxiety sweeps over me my intrusive thoughts make me think i'm going to go crazy and harm somebody I love even though I'm the most sensitive person that wouldn't harm a fly. It's because the anxiety plays on our fears and we often feel like we're losing control and this makes us feel like our mind is breaking. Our anxiety will say ""imagine if you ended up on a psych ward in a straight jacket"" and this makes us feel fear, heightened by the anxiety voice saying ""what if"" or ""imagine if"". I just try to live in the now/ present and ignore the 'what ifs', like somebody earlier said crazy people don't know they're crazy, and anybody with anxiety has probably felt the same as you at some point- you will be fine ""this too shall pass"", it never lasts forever and you are certainly not crazy. I never used to self-analyse until I sta
rted to get anxiety. One minute I would be like ""I didn't feel anxious for that last 5 minutes, I'm so happy"" and then because I'd acknowledged my feelings I'd start to feel anxious, it's like my anxiety was punishing me for not feeling anxious and it almost felt as if I'd brought it on myself, and I'd be clinging to every good emotion praying that the unwelcome visitor wouldn't come, but he always did. I sometimes try to imagine the anxiety as a big bully and if you listen to the bully it will pick on you more, but if you listen to the good voice in your head and ignore it it will get bored and start to disappear. It may never fully go but you can manage it. You will stop self-analysing and thinking about how you feel every single day I'm sure of it, as I said before 'this too shall pass'"
175977910,"Oh, I'm glad it's seeming to subside!"
175977911,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, how's it going today?"
175977912,"You can always decrease the Abilify a little and increase the olanzepine a little ^-; I was on ~30-40mg of Abilify and it did make me spend all of my money, e-*****, drive drunk, run away from home, steal prescription pills, write walls of text, overdose, etc.. It helped me with delusions just not paranoia, impulsivity, decision making, recklessness.. Google ""Abilify Class Action Lawsuit"". Don't take my word for it - You could be different and it could be helping you. I'm just aware of this Abilify side effect cuz it agonizes Dopamine 2 receptors."
175977913,"Yeah, I would rather have that problem. Actually I did for the first seven years of medication. Then I could sleep for 11-12 hours straight. Now I consider myself lucky if I get 6 hours."

175977964,"Heya, Panic attacks are indeed scary. I've only ever experienced 2 full blown ones myself, but boy those were enough to scare me. A big fat man. During that time I couldn't sleep well, similar to what you were experiencing. As I am atheist, I was tryin to figure out what was wrong with my body. But after some checks they said I'm all good even though my HR was elevated and i was so tired. Lying on the pillow brings about the palpitations and the fear. But my mom, she told me to listen to Buddhist chantings and meditate. I'm still not a believer nor am I preaching to listen to chantings, what I'm putting across is meditation. Seek peace. Breathe. Listen to white noises(fan slowly swirling/some waves music/nature). Notice your thoughts come in as though you're a third person. Look at the thoughts through an imaginary glass door, let them flow. And practice this. And if you do feel unease, go out and jog with the thinking, ""If i fall and pass, i fall and pass anyway"". But more often than not, you'll 
realize you're completely fine. And you'll get better. It helped me sleep well from then on. Even when the nights are rough. I wish you success. And stay strong. More On Anxiety Panic Disorders 9 Tips On Getting Over Fear And Anxiety Reduce Anxiety Through Your Diet"

First, voice your concerns to your primary care physician at least. I have similar issues as well as incontinence issues. Rule out a UTI without other symptoms. Also react what you drink but also what you eat. I have learned that veggies are good but some have natural diuretic properties that I have to go kind of easy on.

I learned coping skills through CBT and have been able to rely on those and not have to take medicine 95% of the time. Anyway, I am a very self-aware person and recognize that the COVID pandemic has put my anxiety and lack of control over this all at the forefront of most of my thoughts. It feels like I am on a _USER_ID_ - some days at the top of the hill and feel totally fine and even happy with some things quarantine has given me (more time with my daughter and husband etc), but some days I’m speeding down the incline to a low point. Where a small sore throat or sniffle spins me to thinking I caught COVID... I take my temperature 5-10 times a day! Anyone else finding COVID extremely hard on the mental health issues they work so hard to cope with on a regular day? I feel guilt about getting sick and then getting my parents or daught

It would be nice if I could have more energy to do things. Ya I do go walking around sometimes. I don't know why my leg gets tired pretty easily from walking though. I am kind of sad about that. Is there anything I can take to help with the tired legs though. Ya I don't really do much exercise other than walking though. I think that is not cool ya. Are there any simple exercises I can do to help with my health. That would be nice to know ya. I usually read and listen to music to stay busy. I think it is cool to read about things that I don't know about. I usually like to listen to sad music though. I am just sad about having the anxiety condition. I think that it would be hard to get rid of that condition. I am also sad about having the gerd condition. I think I need to have better health to be less sad ya. I am not sure if I can have that

175978001,"Weirdly, I have made contact with a psychiatrist. I rang an organisation ( some weeks ago) who provide mental health support to health care workers. I was distressed at the time because of a massive altercation with someone. In spite of her argument v's my argument, at the end of the day I broke data protection laws. What irked me the most was the lack of protection I have against psycho litigious beatches as well as the patronising lecture and lack of understanding from my boss. He told me I need to 'pick my battles'. I answered, 'I was doing just that'. I had tolerated this extremely difficult and abusive woman for over two years and put my foot down finally. I transferred her files to a male professional, sensing she is one of these women who respond better to men, and resents women, esp those in a position of authority. Because I did not ask her consent, the shiit hit the fan. Anyway I have an appointment on thursday. I have spoken to this shrink on the phone; told him my life story and he seem
ed ok. but, now with the passing of time I have no longer any interest in seeing him and have NO idea what to say or talk about when I make the effort to see him. The altercation seems like a distant memory. The suggestion I go on mood stabilisers is not something I will be taking his advice on. I am not prepared to medicate myself to that extent, as I am already on antidepressants, just so I can tolerate the general public at work. The problem with therapy is, they are never available when you need them. By the time an appointment comes around, it is all too late, and then one sits there either mute, or talking nonsense to justify being there."

It is all too easy to self medicate when dealing with mental health challenges. The good news is that you are aware of this issue...and from the sound of it, caught on to the trouble early on. This will help you in your resolve to cut back or stop in order to properly address your anxiety and improve your overall health. Whatever method/tools you employ for alcohol cessation...remember also to really concentrate on your anxiety coping skills as well. Approaching this as a combined plan should really help you.

175978029,"My issue is an increase in racism and hate crimes the more people focus on ""bad"" things coming for Asia. Many are already blaming the virus on Chinese people as if the whole country plotted it together or that the people are inferior. News media discourse of ""Invasion"" ""Murder Hornet"" implies they're on a mission of taking over and destroying our livelihood and that they go around killing people (uncommon). Now there are people angrily saying the Asian Giant Hornets are directly from China. ""Stir crazy"" is a thing and I'm sure people flying off the handle and getting violent when upset will increase if this lockdown continues to last. People will lash out on who they blame - Security guards for saying to put on a mask or the ethnicity they believe is taking their freedom, etc. - at least until people behave poorly enough that military enforcement could be justified. As for people's behavior, in the Maladaptive Daydreaming thread, PolarBear did a fantastic job of explaining the behavior of o
thers (and why it's actually kind of necessary for the herd to do as their told) probably the most wisom I've gained in years. I've come to peace with a lot of stuff.

175978039,"This is what I'm planning this winter; I'm on Invega Sustenna 150mg every 4 weeks. I want to decrease to 100mg.. but my psychiatrist will probably put it to 100mg every 3 weeks.. This is why; 150mg divided by 21 days = 7.14mg (Before) 150mg divided by 28 days = 5.36mg (Now) 100mg divided by 21 days = 4.76mg (Next step) 100mg divided by 28 days = 3.57mg (Next step after that) So at least it's decreased by half. Then I want to maybe decrease the 50mg night atenolol to 25mg and keep the morning dose at 50mg. 50mg Vyvanse will stay the same (But I want an optional 2x 5mg Dexedrine to take when I need to focus in the evening). 50mg Seroquel will stay the same. Phenibut taper; 1.5g, 1.4g, 1.3g, 1.2g, 1.1g, 1g. .9g, .8g, .7g, .6g, .5g, .4g, .3g, .2g. .1g (12g taper with 25mg CBD every night - 375mg CBD) - Then that will be gone and I'll use 2g once every 3-4 days. Then I will get rid of the 10mg melatonin at night (To 5mg then 0mg). I have 17 refills of 20x 5mg Zyprexa which I'll use for psychosis caused 
by withdrawal of the injection. 4x fish oil and 1000ui vitamin D every day (Will ask doctor for blood test to see how much vitamin D I need every day + SAD lamp for the winter). Already quit smoking (Will use nicotine gum for a year or two then quit). Then 3mg legal psilacetin (Soul revealing drug) and 2.5mg THC gummy every morning for a month (3g shroom). 20 minutes of meditation every evening. Skiing, snowshoeing and hiking (Exercise), (Summer = Hiking, mountain biking and running). No alcohol (Soul eating spirit). Routine. Solving hard puzzles on brain game apps and internet. Talking to people at coffee connections. Phenibut during talks with treatment team to improve sociality with my thoughts. Reading books at least an hour every day and at least one short story. Podcasts at least an hour every day. Watch interesting Netflix shows. Warm showers for 5 minutes, followed by cold showers for 5 minutes, followed by colder water for 30 seconds and then warm water for 20 seconds. 3 day water fasts twice in one 
month. 10 hours of sleep every night (Instead of 12 - Sleep at 12am, wake up at 9am, take Vyvanse, go back to sleep, wake up again at 10am). Get part time job. Research investing in stock market, cryptocurrency and day trading. Research notes on a few different things such as paradox, anhedonia, cure for different mental illnesses. Writing songs and poems, playing guitar and piano and using synth on computer, find inspiring songs. Add autistic savant guy and transgender m2f lesbian (Two smart people - One is the biggest online dealer in Canada and other is like _NAME_ that creates her own molecules) to my WhatsApp group of research chemical friends. Research about my moms specific breast cancer. Think about what books I want to write in the future - Study omnist religious study, western esotericism, buddhism, science fiction, philosophy (_NAME_, _NAME_). Watch news (And investing news). Learn about one country every day (Learn Spanish). Maybe study cryptography and coding. Find careers (Go back to doing colle
ge courses). Learn about addiction, psychedelic therapy and pharmacology. Learn about hacking and scamming. Learn to draw and how to make money online. Learn one new word every day."
175978040,"If you think about it, those things don't necessarily contradict each other. Near-zero belonging is better than less-than-zero. Chronic solitude isn't ideal, but, when human contact / human relationships actually make you feel more alien, solitude is the better option. ""The need for belonging"" is a basic human instinct that doesn't really translate well to modern life, where anonymity in your own community is the norm. What that means is that ""a sense of belonging"" and ""actual human contact"" often are separate things. And for someone who has difficulty feeling at home in any sort of actual social setting, those things can become almost mutually exclusive. Human contact in general has had an impact on my ""personal growth"" over the years mostly through negative reinforcement. ""Things that don't work. Things to avoid. Things that make me feel like crap."" Most of the positive reinforcement to my sense of self has come from ""arts and media"" instead. Music, TV series, video games and such. Th
at's where I get my ""sense of belonging"" from."

175978060,Had a mind rest and fell asleep....
175978061,Nice! What are you making?
175978062,I seem to be better off with no alcohol in the house. When I don’t have alcohol everything is fine and I barely want alcohol. When I have alcohol in the house I feel this impulsive need to just drink it. My sister drank some of the tequila but I went through a box of wine and most of a bottle of tequila in like a week. Ugh. I’m better off without it.
174372280,"It's good that you reached out for help. I went to the search engine and typed in the medicine Vraylar. drugs.com said, Vraylar (cariprazine) ""is an antipsychotic medication that affects chemicals in the brain. ""Vraylar is used to treat schizophrenia in adults. ""Vraylar is also used to treat manic or mixed episodes in adults with bipolar disorder type I. Important Information"" It said side affects included weigh gain. However, it's also said that the benefits of medicines can outweigh the side affects. drugs.com also said above that Vraylar is used to treat bipolar type 1, a condition WebMD.com says: ""Bipolar I disorder involves periods of severe mood episodes from mania to depression. ""Bipolar II disorder is a milder form of mood elevation, involving milder episodes of hypomania that alternate with periods of severe depression."" Concerning the medicine Ingrezza, which you said you also take, drugs.com said, ""Ingrezza (valbe****ne) blocks certain chemicals in the body that may be involved w
ith involuntary muscle movement. Ingrezza is used to treat symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, a nervous system disorder. Tardive dyskinesia causes repetitive uncontrolled muscle movements, usually in the face (chewing, lip smacking, frowning, tongue movement, blinking or eye movement)."" Weight gain was not listed as a side affects of Ingrezza. I've taken an antipsychotic for my bipolar I, also. And it did seem to help with the mania part of that. Beside weigh gain, is the medicine Vraylar helping with your bipolar I? I don't know what to say about the weight gain. I have that also with the medicines I'm taking for bipolar I, which are Lithium (for the mania) and Mirtazapine for the depression. I don't know what to do about the side effects, either, except to keep taking the medicine so I won't be manic or depressed."

175978069,Anyone know what the process is for Possible trigger: donating platelets? Like how it differs from giving blood? The blood sucking vampires as I like to call them (the blood donation people) called me and talked me into it. I guess it takes like two hours. Sheesh that's a long time. But they are going to do a test for Covid antibodies so I guess I'll find out if I ever had Covid.
175978070,"I’m not trying to hear it. It’s just there. Pulsating. Kind of like a swooshing sound of blood flowing. I can hear it and feel it right now.

I hope things don't go too bad. it almost did today but I think we might be in the clear. I wont abandon a friend like some of my so called friends abandon me.

But I'm already on enough GABA and hypnotic chems. I'm just spiritually drained by my mom and sister and the drama. I don't want to live with them. I'm gonna call my therapist tomorrow and make an appointment to see if I can work part time, go to school with my disability and get an apartment or something so I can be alone and get treated with an addictions counsellor, psychiatrist, doctor, therapist/psychologist, independent living counsellor, etc... To get on the right track.. My mom will have to move away because she needs my money. If this can't happen, I'll just be sitting in purgatory so they can get on with their lives and I sit mindlessly unhappy and zoned out, useless and doing nothing."

174372260,"The previous night before this episode, I had to get up early to see my doctor. I don’t remember much. A week before, I was in an extremely dysphoric state from drinking a glass of wine and that’s when the suicidal thoughts started manifesting. I went outside for a walk - Listening to Linkin Park and a few other artists about suicide. I came back inside and told my mom that I was feeling suicidal. The next day, we went to the renters house (Our old house) because my mom didn’t feel that I was safe to be alone and it was turned into a crack house. It disturbed me but I wanted to get out of the dysphoria so I took a higher than usual amount of phenibut. I was laughing and keeping to myself. When we got back, I was even more dysphoric and I remember explaining to my mom that I wanted to move out because I couldn’t focus - She wanted to talk to her new bf about my schizophrenia and then she started talking about herself. That’s when the paranoia started. I was also feeling paranoid about the 
crack house being apart of a bigger conspiracy like the guy I met online that was the biggest online drug dealer in Canada and would buy houses to send mail to - Someone higher up that would get people to come after me so I had to protect my sister and my mom - I got my machete out of the sea can and put it in the car. I took 5mg of olanzepine which calmed me down (This was the night before I went to see my doctor about increasing the injection from every 4 weeks to 3 weeks). My doctor told me that I’m never happy with my meds and there’s no point of changing the length of the Invega Sustenna injection times. He prescribed 14x 5mg diazepam to take every night for a few days and then just take it as needed in case I need to sleep or have an impending sense of doom (On the trip, my chest felt warm because I was having anxiety and my meds were locked in the car and my sister was away with the keys. My mom gave me a lorazepam and I felt better) and use it to withdraw from the 0.5mg alprazolam every evening. I 
took the alprazolam every evening because my sister was being a ***** to me - I said I wanted to be treated like everyone else but when my dad was here, he was making a big deal about my symptoms - All this happens while I think about what the soldiers and cryptocurrency investor said to me on the video chat - I argue with them in my head every day and whether or not what they say is true, I can’t tell what is real. They picked at my identity so hard, said my mom is a ***** when I told them about my ex step dad and saying that she has breast cancer and that’s the reason that I’m a “Slave of the psychiatric system and can’t get out”, made fun of my lack of facial expressions when I’m being grilled and gaslighted. My mom said to my dad that he needs to treat me with respect and not judge me for zoning out at the grocery store. Usually when I feel unwell, I go outside and make a fire. I was reading and listening to music and podcasts - Just enjoying myself and starting to feel better. I listened to 
a song that I thought was sent from God to make me go psychotic every time I listen to it. As I was walking to look for something to take the cover off of the fire, some drunk and stoned guy walked past the yard and said “I don’t judge you” and when I heard that, I thought he was reading my thoughts and I was in a solipsistic state - Really pissed off that every time I feel good or listened to that song lately, something stupid happens. He then said “You don’t judge me - Can I take a piss here?” and I said “no” and he started pissing so I thought he was trying to piss me off and was sent by aliens or something because I was not social distancing I needed juice for my mental health at the gas station - I was afraid that people would say “You aren’t protecting humanity” and I would say “I’m from the future, sent here on an intergalactical mission to save the world - also that humanity needs to die”.. Anyways, I got the shovel in front of me and threatened him and said “I will kill 
you” - It was complete impulse. I knew what I was doing was just a reaction to make reality conform to my solipsism and torment but he gaslighted me and said “Don’t do that - Do you want a joint? Just be chill” and I said “I can’t smoke that - I’m not ****ing chill right now” so I walked inside and he said “Don’t do that” (Because he didn’t want to tell people) and then said “I know where you live”. I walked inside and told my mom, her friend (I thought she was doing coke in the house because I saw a swipe of water not the counter and powder on the floor that she could have wiped off) and my moms new bf (I was annoyed that my mom was talking to him because of the whole thing that the people said to me on the video chat) and I told my mom and she said that it’s ok - She said “Where is he?” and my moms friend said “Let’s go find him - Come out for a smoke” so we went outside and two other guys with the stoned drunk guy were looking at us and said “We need to pass” so 
they walked passed and stared at me and as my mom and her bf were walking out, my mom let the cat out. I said “God damn it” and went to get ham to catch the cat. My mom caught the cat and then fell and said she broke her toe or something and went inside with the cat. I tried to help my mom but she wouldn’t let go of the cat and I said “Give me the ****ing cat”. She was drunk. I then had a complete spasticated meltdown on the front lawn - Yelling and screaming - jumping around and kicking things, swearing “I’m sick of all of this ******** - Every time I start to feel better, some stupid ******** happens”. Everyone was saying that everything is ok and it’s the coronavirus and we’re all in this together and my mom said “What can you take to feel better?” and I said “A zopiclone” - She said “Go take that” so i went into my room, took a zopiclone and a diazepam and felt more relaxed. My mom asked me if the injection is kicking in and i said no. She told me to go to sleep. She said i
f I feel unsafe that I can crawl into her bed. I heard my mom and her bf talking. My mom said “We can’t do this right now - I’m feeling really horny” so they went into my moms room. I heard them having sex so I went outside and made another fire thinking she doesn’t care because the first time I was admitted to the hospital, I was in a psychotic state and knocked on my ex step dads house door because my mom was always over there. It was locked so I overdosed and got sent to the hospital. I was outside with the fire, walking around it and texting my dad (He’s in Mexico). I told him things and he said “Hope your mom doesn’t get used” and I said “Do you think that guy cares about her when he wants to have sex with her while her son goes to sleep after having a mental ****ing breakdown? He just wants one thing” so I said that I would beat him up if he walks out of the house. I waited.. I thought about driving the car into the house or throwing the fire pit into the house but they’re just m
eaningless thoughts.. I left and started walking downtown and “If those guys that were tormenting me come near me, I’m gonna take them all on or they can beat the **** out of me I don’t care”. My dad said “I’m not sending her any money - Just for you and your sister” which is ****** cuz now I have to deal with this because my dad always says that ****. He said “Your mom is an idiot lost in space” and “I thought that guy was hunting her looking for his opportunity” and “He should not have done that to her in your house she should have gone to his room in a hotel”, “She drinks too much” and “I wish you had another option” - “Don’t lose your shit”. I said “I won’t lose my sit” and “She’ll probably send me to the psych ward for walking around town at night she knows the law she’ll do anything she has full control over me like no mother has over any son” and he said “I know.. Kind of evil. She should be examined”. I said “My sister is 17 - She still can b
ut you’d have to pay because she’d lose her job so that’s not an option”. I then walked around town, passing a sitting cop car and dancing and moving around - I took 400 dollars out of a bank machine because I was afraid that my mom would take my money and then met my friend at the gas station. I told him everything and said “I was walking past someone’s house where people were having a camp fire. I wanted to talk to them because i needed someone to talk to but I’d feel like and intruder”. My friend just talked to me and calmed me down and then I left to go back home. I sat by the fire again in the front yard and a cop pulled up and said “We got a distress call from around here”. I told the cop a bunch of stuff about the cat and he said “Is anyone in the house?”, I said “My mom and her bf”. The cops went inside and I could hear them sleeping but her bedroom door was locked so I said “Mom are you ok?” because I thought that her bf was hurting her or something and she said “It
s just me and your sister” I called my sisters name to make sure that she was there because I knew she wasn’t so I banged on the door and said “Open up”. She probably said to her bf to pretend to be my sister I thought and she opened the door and they were both naked but were previously asleep. I said to the cops that everything is fine and they left. I yelled at my mom saying “You don’t give a **** about me you caused my mental illness you ****ing *****” and she then phoned my dad and we all talked. My mom was making up stories saying she thought I was outside by the fire and I said “Then why was the front door locked before I left?”. My dad said for me to go to bed because we both know how messed up she is. I woke up this morning feeling still sort of confused about everything and my sister phoned me and said that my mom does care about me and she does to. I know my mom can do what ever the hell she want, I can’t change her and I won’t try - But I’d rather be out of the house becau
se I can’t focus, she would rather drink and neglect my mental health and lie and manipulate my psychosis, use it against me, admit me to the psych ward, take my money. I know this. Nothing I can do. Now I have to sort out everything in my head. I was thinking about that crack house and my mom said ""We have such good memories"". I don't have good memories."

175978099,I think I might have accused my _PERSON_ coach of being AI. She said she was from Colorado but that could just be a ploy.
175978100,"I’m supposed to be seeing him once a week. Lately, he’s taken a lot of vacation and rescheduled patients (not just me), as he juggles private practice and a state job.

175978101,"I was on Haldol for a few months and then it gave me akathisia...literal hell. _PERSON_ didn't work, cogentin didn't work, so I had to come off of it."
175978102,That sounds pretty scary....
175978103,"I’m 27 and it took me till I was 25 or so to realize that anxiety was the thing that hurt in my chest/stomach and made me feel like the world was caving in. I am not sure if I’m allowed to list meds, but I’m on an ssri, mood stabilizer/epileptic Med, anxiety Med, adhd Med, and a big time anxiety Med for attacks. I felt like I was finally getting a hold on my anxiety and then i Realized I was in denial about how horrible my relationship was. It started imploding. I took a break for a week and couldn’t stop obsessing. I stepped on a scale because I hadn’t in a month or so and I was shocked because I was 10lbs lighter. Then I realized I hadn’t been eating or showering or drinking water or sleeping or studying... literally all I was doing was worrying. I got to see my girlfriend the other day and I had a panic attack before she came over so I took an anxiety pill. Then I had another one the other day. That’s the only time in the last handful of weeks that I’ve really felt like a person. 
I talked to my psychiatrist just as all of this was starting and I just talked about the problems in my relationship and I said I didn’t think my chemical imbalance was to blame but that I needed to work on my relationship. I obviously don’t want to use the anxiety meds when I don’t absolutely need them. What the heck am I supposed to do to get a hold of my shiz? I literally don’t feel like a person. Meanwhile I have to paint on a happy face for my partner. This is a ridiculous word jumble. I’m sorry I’m so scatterbrained. I just really need to focus on school but it feels like the hardest thing ever when I’m nauseous, lightheaded, my muscles are sore, there’s what feels like a black hole ball inside my stomach. I feel like I’m trying really really hard to make it look like I’m holding it together but I just feel horrible. I can’t even put my finger on the problem. Is it just my relationship? Can I just not handle one? Sorry for dragging this out. If anyone reads this... I’d love some 
virtual company. Like I just feel really alone and misunderstood. By virtual company I just mean like have a conversation. I feel like it sounds weird but I’m not really sure how talking to people on the internet works... this is pretty much my first time doing this."
175978104,true for me too ...i stay alone and all these uncertainties add to my existing issues and make me feel low and anxious at times . Same as _PERSON_ mentioned i too have a decent job and have been WFH since March last year and continue to do so as our employer has told us to do so till June. i feel anxiety related to loneliness ...does anyone else feel the same
175978105,"Went out shopping but I forgot my wallet. My mom covered for me and I got a few things because it feels good. Not too much though. A book, and one of those pore cleaner things. Exciting! I was noticeably talkative and happy. I feel great. Manic energy. Feeling less stress now I finished my exam. Hopefully I can be focused tomorrow for work. Got lots to do."

175978107,Hello Here is my story I have been sick since I start my new job well before I have gone to 2 different doctors and they can’t seem to find anything wrong with me. My charts are normal but I can barely walk thru my house or play with my puppy I have had every test done and still nothing I am starting to think I am crazy and it just all in my head but it’s not I can’t work and I can’t do anything without being able to breath even covid was negative. I am losing my mind I don’t know what else to do

175978121,I couldn't. I deal with enough issues with my energy level from my antipsychotics and antidepressants.
175978122,"What kind of situations? I wonder what it all means in those subtle complexities and nuances to have character and morals, I tend to get told that I have those things more often than not lately ... which is amazing because I didn’t realize it. I got told at a certain point in my life after a series of regrettable personal decisions that I lacked morals and had a rotten character. I don’t know what changed but, I’m glad it did. Empathy is a powerful thing, nobody wants to say it but ... high levels of empathy is actually not a common trait to have."

175978136,"I think it most definitely is abnormal. Outside this forum, I don't think you'll find a lot of people who think the same way about celebrations. It's definitely not a normal thing to NOT want to celebrate. Conventional things ARE normal. They're what's done normally. I think that there is something about the shared milestone experience that makes people feel connected to each other in a way that maybe people with SPD don't get."

Do not watch the news. This is a strange thing, then how do you know what's going on? How do you remain connected? How do you avoid danger? How do you stay in some kind of the know? Short answer... Turn towards your inner light and it will guide the way. Keep clear of the violence and fear and conflict as much as possible this week. It's time to create a new routine of more self-love and comfort for yourself, the basics that make you feel best. Proper rest, a little scheduled light exercise, healthy diet, and relaxing showers. Your interests need more nurture. Limit Facebook and all News on a strict and short leash. Call or text more loved ones and those who love you. Surround yourself with your own positives and neutralize the compelling nature we all sometimes give in to by dwelling too much on what is not within our cont

174372419,"Once I was in a psychiatric unit which I voluntarily signed into for treatment, a few days in I started becoming paranoid and untrusting of the setting I was in, when they perscribed me a medication and tried to urge me or force me to take it- though I was initially told everything would be my choice and I didn't have to take any meds I didn't want to. And that I could leave at any time. Though when I asked to leave they tried to stop me twice. When I refused meds, they continually tried to force and coerce and persuade me. Eventually I played along, put the meds in my mouth. And nodded and listened when they asked me about why I shouldn't leave, as if I agreed with them. Saying, ""yeah you're totally right."" ""I've changed my mind! "" And then I spit the meds out from under my tongue into a trash can, and I snuck out of the facility through the kitchen. Never went back, or took that medication. They gave me buspar and Abilify. On top of what I was already taking, lexapro. LOL"

If the Zoloft does not help me (or if the side effects do not abate), I am considering doing the same thing you are doing -- go off SSRIs, take a Klonopin on rare occasion when I really need it, and try to deal with my anxiety through therapy and personal effort. I just cannot tolerate all the trial and error and side effects, while doctors make wild guesses about what might help. In particular I find the sleep deprivation hard to tolerate. I agree with you that exercise helps. I never much enjoyed exercise, and particularly when I am feeling sleep deprived. But I am doing it every day. I ran at 6 am today.

175978215,"It was my grandmother. I actually mentioned it to one of my pdocs, and she said to be optimistic. I mentioned it to a family friend, and she was also practical but optimistic about it. It's just that my grandmother has a way of crushing my dreams and goals. I try not to let her get to me anymore, but that doesn't work all the time. I think she means well when she offers her opinion, but boy-oh-boy do I feel hopeless afterwards. Yup...I absolutely understand thinking yourself into a corner. I seem to be a pro at that haha! I would like to start thinking of myself that way. I've made some progress over these last few months to start thinking of myself as simply a person with strengths and needs just like everyone else. But I do tend to fall back into thinking of myself negatively. I think that happens especially when I desire to reach a goal or dare to dream anything. I quit before I start because I can't even see the point of trying. I'm trying to learn to think of failure in terms of I just learned 
what not to do...I didn't fail. You're absolutely right about moving. I would definitely need to plan and have those coping strategies. I don't know. Maybe I'm aiming too high? But I can't help but think that this is not an impossible thing here. My pdoc told me to be optimistic about it, and she said that support should be available in the new city. I talk to a therapist. That's a really good idea about baby steps towards meeting goals. I've met quite a few this past year already. Thank you for your support! Thank you so much for your encouragement! I'm working on believing that I DO have value."

I feel pretty dang dissociated now but that's probably the xanax too. I'm getting more xanax at the pharmacy tonight so I'm not going to run out."

175978235,"So....this is new to me. My wife suffers with depression, anxiety, and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Some days are great and others horrible. I have found myself recently retreating into the dark cave of apathy. Some days she’s mean and rude, and usually I can handle it, however, sometimes it’s hard not to take it personal. Sometimes I’m really walking on eggshells. I feel like I can’t be honest about how I feel sometimes because I have sent her spiraling and triggered her so many times for doing it. I’ve even waited until a “good day” to tell her how I feel and it’s almost worst with comments like, “I finally thought I had a good day”, “you see, you’re better off without me”, “you should divorce me” etc...anyone out there on the same page or past this stage with some advice/support?"
175978236,I will tell you later.

175978241,"I think it's great that you've tried writing here (and perhaps elsewhere). My wife also ended our relationship a few years ago...(since then, we divorced and remarried and then she's left again) So, in a nutshell, I understand more or less the panic and anguish you're facing... Your bf sounds a lot like my wife...hence he probably has undiagnosed Bipolar or some relevant disorder. I will be _NAME_. To have a sustainable relationship for any length of time...and I'm not talking about forever(perhaps a year or two, a decade or two; who knows what God has in mind), he MUST be diagnosed and then be either on medication and/or perhaps ECT, depending on how severe his condition is... Mania, if I don't remember wrongly, is more severe than hypomania...so if it's mania, you're in for a rough ride. Still, hang on to the railings and don't fall off! 1. If you want to pursue this long-term, you must try your very best, your utmost, to persuade him to obtain a diagnosis from the MH hospital and relevant meds. 
Otherwise, don't even think about this long-term. Without meds, his moods will be unpredictable indefinitely. 2. How much do you love him? Is he the only one for you for the rest of your life? Cos' for me, my wife is. And I'm willing to go the distance for her. Are you willing to go for him? In his lucid state, how does he feel about you? If he feels the same way, then hang in there and pray the hardest you've ever had to God...and maybe it might work out. I offer you no hope, just perhaps a tiny sliver of it because this will be a _USER_ID_ for the rest of your life. With meds, it's less of a _USER_ID_...more of a ride on a _NAME_ beach on a sunny day, with the occasional lovely seagulls, together with the obnoxious black crows... Since you say you really love this man, then you already know what to do. Post Edited (_PERSON_) : 6/2/2019 6:51:40 AM (GMT-6)"

174372566,"Hi everyone I just wanted to share my story and experience with schizophrenia to see if anyone can relate. In May 2015 I had my first psychotic episode while I was at work. I was working as a barista and had little sleep the night before. I started to hear my roommates voice tell me he was going to kill me if I didn't pay the rent I owed the last month I lived with them. I didn't have the money and my roommates knew that I couldn't pay it. I started hearing their voices that morning and thought they were out to kill me because I didn't pay the rent. I worked in a hospital lobby espresso bar and as soon as I heard my roommates voice tell me he had a gun I freaked out and locked myself in a room in the hospital till the ambulance came and brought me to a different hospital. I was believing my roommates were telling me to pay the rent or I would die. I kept hallucinating and imagining my roommate with a gun ready to shoot me when he was no where near me that day. I was released from the hospital that 
night. The next morning I asked my roommates if that was him I was hearing and he started laughing and responded saying ""no but I did have a doctor's appointment that day"". Because he was laughing and couldn't keep a straight face when I asked him I was suspicious that he was responsible for the voice I heard in my head. I lived with two roommates who were brothers for 6 months while in college and never had any arguments with them. The day I had my episode I heard both of their voices playing with my mind about the unpaid rent. The voices were telling me that I was going to get arrested and the government was after me but I knew these voices sound a lot like my roommates and the voice told me it was my roommates too. I was lost and confused and stressed out from college so I failed that quarter. A month later in June 2015 I had another mental breakdown. This one want as worse because my brain knew it was just my roommates voices. I was still hearing ""pay the rent"" ""my brother is going to shoot you"" ""m
y brother shot your dad and mom"" and I believed it because I still had no idea how I was heading these voices but I knew they were my roommates voices. I went to the hospital that day and was released that night. After this I started to hear them in my head more frequently during the night time before bedtime while we were all in the same apartment. It appeared as if they were doing nothing but I suspected they were reading my mind. Their voices kept asking me questions about my past sexual experiences in my head and that I needed to pay the rent because it would affect their credit scores. This was the first time I started to believe they could read my mind with some kind of software that is top secret. These roommates that I had are Christian and believe in Jesus as well as they knew I was Christian too. We all sat down one night before we all moved out at the end of June 2015 and I asked them if they could help me with my sexual addiction and they said they might have something that could help out but nev
er actually specified or showed me what it was. Another thing that made me believe they were reading my mind is we were all gathered in the living room, I was hallucinating their voices and they were telling me to pay the rent while staring directly at me and their mouths weren't moving. I didn't know what was going on so I left the apartment immediately and went to stay with family. Clearly they were communicating to me telepathically but I had no evidence that they were reading my mind and they wouldn't tell me with their mouths they were reading my brain. Their voices in my head told me they have software that could read my brain but I can't see how a computer could read the brain. For a while I believed this was the truth and listened to whatever the voices told me. Back then I thought they were gang stalking me for not paying the rent on time and because they didn't like that I had sex with multiple women inside of the apartment we all lived in. In my mind they were telling me ""you're not a Christian yo
u have had sex with a lot of people"". After moving out of that apartment with them I still heard their voices and was depressed for 3 months. Couldn't get out of bed. I was enrolled in community college and failed that while quarter because I couldn't get over the intensity of my voices. The way my voices was making me feel was very agitated most of the days and annoyed. At this point I want diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was diagnosed with adhd, sleep apnea, and migranes. The voices began to tell me ""medication is a sin and that I would go to hell for taking drugs"". I couldn't think this was a lie because the voices were controlling my thoughts and I finally threw away all the medication I had. The voices told me this is what Jesus wanted me to do. The voices of my now ex roommates also told me because their computer program was connected to my brain they could feel all of my feelings. I took adhd medication and the voices tried to prove to me that the medication didn't work because it just provides you 
with a feeling. I thought all of this was real and tried to get my family to believe it too. One way I tried to relieve the voices was to buy some noise canceling headphones. I tried them and I could still hear the voices clearly. I can't see how this would be my ex roommates doing this to me because sometimes the voices are loud and sometimes quiet so they would need some way to turn it down and up if mind reading was real. If I can still hear the voices with my headphones on and turned all the way up its definitely not a computer program. No computer is that strong. It's just a really bad hallucination. Fast forward to now a days in 2019 I still hear voices that still continue to tell me they are real and my ex roommates who are reading my brain. I continue to believe I am just hallucinating. I argue with the voices and tell them they aren't real and that my roommates are innocent. This helps me out because the voices have no way to change my beliefs. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar ex
perience to this type of schizophrenia or voices that you may hear."

Before symptoms started (walking into walls, bad headaches, shaky) I played all kinds of sports including being on a traveling women's ice hockey team (played 3 years after DX but when I started shaking-trembling on bench during game I had to stop). In Jan 2014 neuro says I now have SPMS. I get vertigo (85% of the time), pain thruout my whole body. I've been on everything injectable MS med til the point that I have welts all over stomach n butt. I just switched over to a pill (Tecfidera) for MS. I'm on Cymbalta and Clonazepam for depression and anxiety but I still get panicky to the point where my stomach turns. Dizziness (vertigo) are almost a daily thing. Altogether I'm on 10 meds. I've had at least 10 bouts of optic neuritis and on 3 separate occasions I woke up and couldn't walk. I live with my 83 year old father (and a sister who works ft) I feel like a burden but he doesn't think so. I'm on So
cial Security Disability. I've never had a place of my own but I want to. I have a lot of anger regarding MS along with depression and anxiety. Only thing in life that I look fwd to is NY Rangers hockey n my nieces/nephews. MS HAS taken over my life and people (some family members) say they understand when I don't feel like hanging out- (even just by going downstairs to play cards because if vertigo and want to lye down instead of listening to the noise) but than they tell say ""come on, don't be antisocial"".

I remember when I was 12 I had a feeling my sister was not going to be alright. She was going to the mall one day. I told my dad and he didnt believe me. Then she didnt come home for longer than expected and it had turned out her car died coming back home. I've always been like this.

But no one philosophized with me growing up. I was just told to vacuum the carpet over and over again if I missed any spots, swept floors and sanded trailers - No one told me to develop as a person.. Just to self-discipline through mindless tasks.. And now, people think they can change the world and manifest through anything - When if I were to meet a person in the past, it was just a coincidence.. OOooh a coincidence - That means that I wasn't meant to talk to them... In the isolated place, meaningless sensory deprivation and insanity of giving into the pain and walking the highway looking at passing semi's go by Me: I'm not anti-safety! It was an example of posts i see on FB - Note to self: Use examples in more va

My other roommate came into my ""room"" asking for candy, but at least she pulled my curtains back closed when she left. So the horrible one kept playing with her lights, turning them on and off repeatedly at like 3am. She sleeps in her clothes and shoes and then complains that she gets too hot. She could put the ac on but she'd rather fvck with stupid ways to annoy us. She shouted which scared me, and I summoned the CNA and asked if he would talk to her but he said he'd only make it worse. I don't know what to do anymore."

You have to get out of bed before you can work on your goals. Can you take any kind of vacation? Getting away by yourself might be really helpful to try to think of everything you want to do and how to go about it.

175978352,I'm waiting for snack and meds to be over so I can use my pod with less worry. They haven't been this late in weeks. I should have gone out to vape. But I told myself I could stay in and use a pod since I have 2 left and one cartridge. We didn't get to the vape store. Snack just came! I was weighed this morning. Grand total of weight lost since I started is 6 pounds! Better than nothing!
175978353,Yes. I keep hoping there won't be an afterlife so I don't have to carry all my awful memories on. Nothing would matter. That gives me more hope these days. But there probably is an afterlife.
175978354,yes I did and washed my hair
175978355,Maybe get a job in Blackfoot Indian country. I think you'd like it there. They're very generous and trusting.

As long as people continue to be respectful and use this site appropriately I believe it will help many people as it has for me."

175978366,So I think I mentioned here last month I contacted the director of data science for the company I work for on linkedin asking for career advice and she said to contact her in August to possibly set up a meeting. I emailed her today. Ahhhh! So nervous now. I emailed and then immediately shut down my computer. My social anxiety is hoping that she’ll just email me some info instead of wanting to chat on Microsoft teams.

175978371,"Today is a good day. I took 400mg of phenibut to sleep last night and it knocked me out. I woke up, took the Vyvanse and was tired as hell from smoking weed I guess still sleeping on Vyvanse.. Had a coffee, then I went for a 10km walk, went to the pharmacy to pick up eczema cream (Jk Job.. Acne cream..) and another 20x 5mg olanzepines which I use for sleep instead of the 100mg Seroquels.. The pharmacist said that 100mg Seroquel shouldn't cause heart palpitations and I cut it in half (50mg) before I went to the ER a few nights ago.. I'll try it one more time and if my heart/chest feels weird, I can't take the Seroquel anymore. I'm just doing it cuz Seroquel is a really good sleep med.. Probably the best that exists.. I then shovelled the snow, chipped the ice... A lot of exercise.. Had shower, cleaned the litter box, emptied garbages, washed dishes.. Now I'll listen to a bit of music and try to learn a bit about investing until the sun goes down. I might smoke a bit of weed right now. I'm not taking 
phenibut today but I'll take 500mg tonight. Withdrawal isn't as bad as I thought - Or I just feel good for no reason - No irritability, agitation, anxiety, etc.."

A lot of the times I don't use my phone when everyone is on their phones. My thoughts are way more interesting.. But I love music and podcasts which might be making me rely on other people's thoughts to be more extroverted? Idk.. I don't remember anything from a podcast but when I listen to it again, I remember every word. That really bothers me.. Idk what that's about.. Maybe I need more access to my subconscious..

175978395,"All good questions. No serum levels were EVER ordered. I didn’t know I needed it checked Surprise! I trusted my doctor to take care of me. Will now suggest to my PCP at my next physical to check that level. Was on antidepressants years ago but since the oxcarbazepine or at some point of my treatment plan i was taken off and did fine for years with this current combo. Yes I do have anxiety & panic attacks and my life at most times has been in HIGH anxiety mode for me and always needed the Xanax. When he just lowered It I did not have an issue with it. Figured I could try the new dosage. But with the other change so abruptly as well it sent me into a panic in the way he handled the whole situation. Like WTH??? Why now? I wasn’t having any issues. Thanks for all your information. Most appreciative! I have more info now than I did and more homework to do and I hope my new psych (once I find one) will help me get back on track. GEESH. Lesson learned, Sincerely, _PERSON_??"

I haven't fully acted on the impulses, but have half-way acted on them.

175978410,I haven’t been on here much lately. I’ve been okay. Anxiety getting to me here and there. I started seeing a psychologist last week for anxiety. Mainly social anxiety. I’m bad around people. I get real anxious and start dissociating. I’m working on it. I just saw her for the second time yesterday. Going over negative thinking it was hard. I felt some dissociation and derealization the other day at work. Tried to use some grounding techniques the psych had gone over with me. They helped. Aside from that my mood has been pretty stable. Haven’t been psychotic. Just anxious.
175978411,Having issues with my friends and cps. My friends girlfriend has the kids at her sisters. Apparently they are having a hard time taking care of the oldest who is special needs and plans on having the kids split up. That's not fair to him or the other two. They ended up sending him to the cps agency WITHOUT TELLING MY FRIENDS. Hes been there for two days. Just him... not his brother and sister. The kid is more than likely to be scared on top of being taken from the home. probably thinks no one wants him and ****. We're trying to send all 3 of them to my friends aunt and uncle... at least the oldest will be there.

175978422,"Can someone with Schizophrenia & Psychosis also have Dissociative Disorder. My son is Schizophrenic with episodes of Psychosis. He has had visual and audio hallucinations since he was 3. I know it frighten him and we used to put music on at night to help him go to sleep. This way he couldn't hear the voices. The voices frighten him. I was afraid his doctor would put him on anti psychotic drugs so I didn't tell the doc. This was in the 80s when doctors were giving adult meds to children like candy. Any way my son managed well through his childhood years. When he turned 14 he started to have mood swings and issues with maintaining friendships with his peers. He always got along with the girls however. Over the years I have noticed he has distinct personalities that come and go. My son even refers to himself as us. A part of him is aware of the different selves but most selves don't know about each other. He has one part that hates me for things I did in another life, he has one who is young and loves 
me and is very kind to me. He has a dad part that came out when his sons were born. That part is irritated by me but is kind to me. And there are several other parts. I can see and identify five parts. I know how he will be toward to me depending who is out. The doctors said my son is Schizophrenic, bipolar with episodes of psychosis and delusion. He has these things. My question is can children who are experiencing visual and audio hallucinations at a very young age create selves to protect them from the fear? I have asked counselors and therapists but they are not familiar with DID and don't have an answer. I have even written to doctors who have written and studied DID and still have not heard back. I am at a loss to who to ask next. Any information would help. Thanks. Sorry for the long post."

175978428,Do you think the Geodon isn't helping yet? You're on a really low dose right?
175978429,"I totally get that. Unfortunately there is no quick fix to most things in life, but seeing it just as steps that you are going forward each time you try something new and don‘t give up, might help? Like with the medication, even if the fifth one didn‘t work, you at least tried and went a few steps forward towards your goal. And even if nothing is going to work, you‘ve still walked forward and other opportunities might have come up during that walk. Maybe keeping that in mind can help a little."

175978434,"I see my regular doctor in about a month. If I am still having trouble with it I will bring it up to her and see what she says. Although last time when I told her my knee had been bothering me for a few months she just said take ibuprofen. Although now my knee isn't bothering me anymore so maybe she knows what she is talking about. But she didn't examine it or anything. Although to be honest, I think she was more worried about me just having gotten out of the hospital than anything. She kept saying my name a lot so I must have been dissociating some. But my therapists think I am having psychosomatic issues at the moment so this may be psychosomatic as well. Not entirely sure what that is but I think it is where something in the brain makes physical pain or makes physical pain worse. If it doesn't go away in a few hours when I get off of work I will put some heat on it. That should help. HUGS Kit"

175978438,I actually don't have a bed. But if I did I wouldn't share it with anyone. I like my own space too much. It's not always been like this though. I used to love sharing a room when I was in children's homes. I never slept as a child though so I used keep everyone awake and sometimes end up climbing out of the window. When I was with my ex I never shared a space for sleeping but I'd go to his room for sex in the morning. I can never understand all that marital bed business. I think it's just propaganda.

I want to have a piece of mind that’s all. Grounding skills... reality checking... telling the voices they’re wrong...my existence is a horror movie. I see demons lingering... spirits, mainly children, lingering too singing ring around the roses. In the hospital there was writings on the wall with blood that said die. Once looked to the mirror and saw my face deteriorate into a skull like figure. If I’m not seeing figures I’m in my head with the consent blabbing and insults to try to make me feel bad about myself and do things I don’t want to do. I’m crazy. A bit touched. But I don’t want to linger in self pity because there are those who had it worse. My mental state has decreased a lot for about 11 years... rapidly. I hope clozapine helps out."

175978462,For me it’s easier to think of it this way: “I heard “kill this person” in my head” instead of “the voice wants me to kill someone.” Because the voice isn’t a real person so it can’t want anything. It’s just a sound you heard like if you were hearing echoes in a cavern. That usually takes some of the power away from it if you can think like that.

175978470,"E, there are several type of sleep apnea. The most common one is obstructive sleep apnea. This type happens when the throat muscles intermittently relax & block the airway during sleep. A noticeable sign of this type is snoring. Here are the typical symptoms; excessive daytime sleepiness loud snoring observed episodes of stopped breathing during sleep (by another person) abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking waking with a dry mouth or sore throat morning headaches difficulty concentrating during the day mood changes such as depression or irritability high blood pressure decreased libido The above symptoms are on the Mayo Clinic's website. The symptoms you discussed with the dentist are not on this list. I am surprised at the dentist even making the suggestion. If you have been stressed/anxious more lately, certainly that will affect you sleep. Grinding your teeth, stress will cause this with many of us. As a dentist, she should have been able to look at your teeth to look for damage t
o your teeth from grinding them. They makes plastic mouth guards available in drugstores for people that grind their teeth. I worked in a high stress job & would grind my teeth at night & caught myself during the day doing it. The next morning my jaws would ache from a night of grinding. The plastic piece helped a lot, plus it made me feel better knowing I wasn't damaging my teeth. Both my husband & son have apne. My husband will not use a CPAP machine, his is severe. He snores like a freight train, I sleep with ear plus. When he sits down he falls asleep within minutes, in bed he jerks awake. At night he flips & flops so bad he is like a fish out of water. But, his is severe. He has nearly every symptom _NAME_ this list. My son has the machine & says he sleeps the best he has ever. He no longer wakes up tired, he is rested. Most of all he no longer snores! Check out the Mayo Clinics site & read up about this. Unless you are having symptoms listed above this does not sound like sleep apnea. I am not a dr but 
have good knowledge of it, lol."
175978471,"You mention your mood plunged in April, so probably the Pandemic Effect is a big factor. Life as we all knew it abruptly changed for all of us, so it's not the least bit surprising that you--like so many millions--are struggling now to adjust to a new, surreal reality. I've found that avoiding most TV/Internet ""news"" and political chatter is helpful in reducing stress and negative feelings and improving sleep. Also, unplugging a few hours before bedtime and trying to spend as much time as possible outdoors, exercising and looking a natural beauty is very relaxing. The media feeds anxiety because 100% of it relies on hype, hysteria, faux rage to attract viewers and boost ratings. Politicians/partisan media pundits argue, shout, and blame the other party because they think fear and anger motivate people to vote for them or against their opponents. That may be true, but being bombarded by so much toxic media harms the mind.Post Edited (kate333) : 8/18/2020 11:34:51 AM (GMT-6)"
175978472,"Usually, it's service. I like to be helpful. Usually, it's the thing that tires me most though, because I don't have the art of being able to balance my own needs with others' needs in real time. So, I need that balance of being just with myself and taking care of my own needs and doing things that satisfy and re-energize me. I don't know if I can say I have a sense of anticipation and excitement about the future. I'm not certain that I've ever felt that. I find that usually people have these things about personal milestones and achievements and I'm not really into that."
175978473,"Hi Bam, Heart attack pain is often described as a sensation of a crushing weight on one's chest. There may also be pain in the jaw line area, or even upper back, and a shooting/radiating pain going down the left arm. With a cardiac event you are also going to have nausea (extreme) shortness of breath and dizziness/feeling faint. Of course the frustrating thing about these symptoms are that they are also often present with anxiety, especially a panic attack where they might all be happening simultaneously. In your case however, it sounds like you are primarily dealing with the chest pain which would not be indicative of a HA...especially considering that you are not high risk. So do your best to trust your doctor and keep working on your Health Anxiety management to reach the goal of not getting derailed by your anxiety symptoms...and eventually lessening/eliminating them altogether.

When bi-polar people fail to take their medications it can become quite problematic.. Not just for them but for the people who care about them. Like I say, it is up to you what you are going to live with. Granted if she takes her medication she is a lovely person.

175978485,"_AT_MENTION_ Sorry I missed your reply. I think a contact person would be great if they had medical knowledge and experience with mental health disorders. I'm not sure a social worker would be the right person for it because there is such a _USER_ID_ around social workers. Most of them aren't great. I know its kind of ironic to play into a _USER_ID_ when there is such a huge one around mental health in general, but it would be remiss to ignore it. I totally agree though. Insurance companies pick from a list of whatever is closest to you without an understanding of what they actually do. We just end up spending so much money in copays that lead us nowhere that it is crazy! If would could have a go to person or group of people that are knowledgeable about mental health and know the area that would be amazing. They would also have to know a little bit about insurance and benefits as well though. One of the huge hurdles is people being able to afford the care that we need. If it isn't covered by insura
nce or it isn't affordable then it is useless. Going off of what _NAME_ said, there are definitely preferable places to go when in crisis. For example, one of the most common places to take people in crisis is one of the worst. There are other options but the state funds this place over the better facility. When you are in crisis you are often not listened to about where you want to go either. When we are in crisis we need to be able to go to a safe place that isn't just about drugging us up until we are zombies and then shipping us out. It doesn't help anything and in fact does more damage than good. Hope this helps and sorry again for not checking back."
175978486,"Hi Guys, I recently posted this on the UC forum but thought maybe I could get some advice here: I am currently recovering from a nasty ulcerative colitis flare that started in the beginning of June. I am currently tapering off of prednisone. Currently on 20mg, started taking it at the beginning of July. I feel much better and I am currently only going to the bathroom once a day. However my anxiety/stress are through the roof. I’ve never been this anxious in my life. I have panic attacks every other day. I find myself unable to breathe at times and super sick to my stomach. I’ve always had mild anxiety that usually intensifies when I flare up. This past week has been hell. I guess I’m anxious about not knowing if I’ll ever reach remission again. I am stressed about being stressed, if that makes any sense. I know stress is super harmful to the body and I guess I feel like as long as I am stressed or anxious I won’t be able to recover. I feel stressed basically the entire day. I feel pressur
e in my temples. It’s literally preventing me from functioning. I don’t know if anyone has some advice about how I can deal with my anxiety. I am trying to get control of my life again. Physically and mentally. Everyday I feel so anxious that my face feels numb. Has anyone else ever experienced this feeling. I also get this weird sensation in my back which I can’t help but to link to my anxiety. Tonight was difficult. I tried to watch my favorite show and felt the anxiety just creeping in. I ended up having a small panic attack and my mum had to walk me through my breathing."

I think what's central to sci fi, as compared with fantasy, is that sci fi has realism built in. I could be wrong though. My roommate things sci fi is for men but the genre was created by _NAME_, and her book, Frankenstein, might be not just the first, but the best sci fi."
175978491,This is a great plan! I think you are very brave and that you are very wise! I think that you are doing the absolute best that you can. I'm glad you are going to call your doctor. The long time that he has worked with you has proven that he is not trying to harm you. Sometimes these things just happen and its not anyone's fault or blame. Try not to blame yourself. Now you are taking care of yourself and that is a good thing. I am so freaking proud of you!

One is at work, after a long or difficult conversation with a client, knowing I went above and beyond what they expected of my knowledge. The second is the moment after I close my front door. I'm in my own house, and I have a huge, awesome dog standing next to me, and nobody can bother me if I don't want them to. It's really, really simple...but growing up dreading going home, and having a dog being my life dream, it's huge for me. I often just pause for a few seconds and soak in the feeling."
175978497,Hi Folks As some of you know I decided to stop taking Olanzapine and reduced my dose from 15mg down to 0 over a 4 week period and stopped at the end of October last year. Since then I have been experiencing bad withdrawal effects with the worst being not being able to sleep. I was at my doctors this morning and we decided that the only way to sort this out is to go back on a small dose of Olanzapine 5mg for a period of a few months and then start to withdraw again but over a much longer period. I'm feeling a bit down about this as I really did not want to go back on this medication but I can't see any other way. _PERSON_

175978499,"I just feel like everyone in the world is affected by the news and social media and all the stupid opinions about abortion, gays, unemployment, homelessness, like it's all the same same ****. It's all the same. I can't stand it anymore. Then people are like ""I'm a white supremacist"" like why??? They devote their life to it and all these personas that people put on trying to impress each other like tribal stuff. They only difference between the past and now is that there's technology. People want to limit speech and the people that don't want to limit big companies from limiting free speech and all the prisoners in China and the nuclear war that's going to happen, animal cruelty, ""I'm a vegan"" and make an identity about anything they want. It's all the same. I know the truth. I want to go to a reality where there's no paradox and I don't understand everything. It's like people are dead but still alive and not real and I'm the only one that is real and I'm God. It makes me not want to live cuz I 
can't stand playing on the stage and doing meaningless shallow things where people put others down to make themselves feel better, talk behind each others backs. Everything is so dysfunctional and stupid. People paying attention to celebrities and vegetating. I can't stand it.

For years I have told myself to see a therapist but I just have never gotten myself to do it and finally, a few weeks ago I managed to call and get on the wait list.

175978517,"Hi There, It sounds like you both need to seek help together or separate. Does she want to stay? From personal experience, staying together for the children eventually ends anyway. Cheating is a symptom of an underlying issue. If she is not happy, she will probably repeat - this is the way she copes. I think you both need to learn the skills needed for a healthy relationship and how to cope with communication and what each other needs. If you find there is no common ground then, go from there. Her happiness is not your responsibility. Your happiness is your responsibility. There are many books, podcasts, and TedTalks that can give you a lot of insight to help you find your way. Your feelings are valid. You just need some guidance on how to cope with them. It is almost like trauma, you have never experienced this situation before. I am here if you need to talk more. I am proud of you for reaching out. Stay safe and be well."

175978525,"I decided to write out everything I've been thinking since I express myself much better in writing than in speech. I decided to make a 50-minute appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow as of a couple days ago. This was because I felt like we could work everything out. I am beginning to doubt this decision. As a result of doubting things, I made another appointment with a different psychiatric provider on Monday. Now, since I am unable to cancel the one tomorrow, I feel a bit stuck. I am now wondering if I should just keep the appointment on Monday. That is because I don't know whether I would really benefit from doing both. It is a lot of money, but I know that I won't likely get the satisfaction of knowing that there is another provider out there who can actually help me if I cancel the appointment on Monday. Anyway, you guys don't have to read all of this, it just helps me to get my thoughts out like this. The other thing that is nagging at me is the fact that my parents will probably complain 
about all of this stuff with seeing two different providers within a week's time or less. I suppose I just need to explain to them that I won't get any certainty about whether or not I can work with a different pdoc if I don't see both of them."

Just sucks and hits home so badly when there’s none from my mom.
175978527,"I deal with anxiety every day. I get anxious about everything. Especially words people say, like maybe there are hidden meanings in them. Maybe they are not innocent. I have to fight my head to not ask the person what they meant because I don't seem to be able to take it at face value sometimes. Like today a coworker who is senior to me said to me ""we should not bother her today"" referring to one of the owners. I'm like, does that mean I usually bother her? Like maybe I am a bother? Maybe I am bothering people right now. But if I act like that in the workplace then I get labeled as more paranoid than I already am. So I had to fight my head not to ask those questions. I get anxious about work. I get anxious when I am not at work. I get anxious about T appointments. I get anxious about driving. I get anxious about sleeping. I get anxious about my cat's health. I get anxious that something bad is going to happen to my parents. I get anxious about everything. I usually take Xanax at least once a day, 
and usually more than one pill at a time (I'm allowed four a day--but I'm trying to keep it at three.) I'm on Trintellex actually. I'm on the highest dose. IDK if it really does me any good but none of the antidepressants I've been on seem to help for very long. A Pdoc of mine awhile ago wanted to put me on lithium but I was scared of it and didn't want to go on it. Now I'm desperate and I'd probably try anything. I'm not on a mood stabilizer though. I'm on an AD, and ADHD, an AP, a benzo, a statin, sleep med, supplements, medication for migraines, medication for acne, and I can't think what else. My emotions are either really intense or I feel nothing at all, or just anxiety. And the emotions come out of nowhere. Like for no reason I'll just get suicidal and sad and self destructive. My doctors can't figure it out. I think maybe I am cursed. And there are these shadowy figures that keep surrounding me and they have bats and pipes and they want to hurt me. They make me anxious.

175978557,"Thank you so much. I am looking forward to getting the ball rolling. I find it really enticing to be well again. Or at least to reach a stable point. I think I can, I think I can. And there are always things that happen that provide the entire world to be over again. Then I mess up. I need to learn what exactly is a trigger that makes me so unwell. I need to really think about it in my history with this disorder. A trigger is a thing that makes me feel bad in the context of my illness. It means this thing or that thing affects me to be in a bad spot. I need to recollect all these things. (Excuse the language but I thought that was a common way to put it). Anyway, I'm trying to not dwell on the moments because that makes it worse. Carry on, carry on. I think now that tea is sort of bad for me. But anyway, the doctor really saved the day when she said Infused Water with fruit 'seasoning'. I have a stupid habit of drinking water and tea and coffee and soda all day long. I find it hard not to call myse
lf an alcoholic when I don't drink at all. Not a single drop. I feel dehydrated. My 'inner voice' says I'm one wicked abuser of all sorts of things. But let's not dwell on that either. I think that I'm coming into my own and I like it. People are helpful."
175978558,I'm so sorry... There really aren't words that could make it better. It takes time. I'll keep your family in my thoughts.

Also, Saturday, I found out that if I just continually call unemployment, I get through, so that's my goal Monday, so there is hope! I can get unemployment money by Wednesday. I hear Wednesday is when they direct deposit. I have plenty of food until then. Still, I wont be wasteful. If I do get that check though, I might get a rib eye to celebrate."
175978562,I start back teaching next month. This break from teaching went by too quickly.
175978563,"First, it’s good that you wrote in. Second, I think you have a very good therapist. I’ve had a few psychologists, but they all seemed to think they could cure me without medicine. The fact that you have a therapist who would listen to you talk, hear of your difficulties, and realize she might need more than just a pep talk every now and then, and then recommend a psychiatrist, is pretty amazing to me. I’ve had bipolar for many years and remember the first time I took Lithium (for the mania part) I felt like a weight had been taken off of my shoulders. I only then realized how much I had been battling the tension of mania. It was just a natural feeling for me because I had been battling that for most of my life. It was like I had been gritting my teeth and “bucking up” just to make it through a small amount of time. Oh, I remember what I thought now, when I took my first lithium pill after 10 or 15 years of being tense: I thought it felt like the air had been let out of an overly inflated 
balloon. I couldn’t believe I had not taken Lithium sooner. One of the problems was, my psychiatrists had not prescribed it. I would come in in a depressed state, and they would diagnose me as depressed, and give me an anti-deperssant. Because they had not diagnosed me right, then they couldn’t medicate me right, so it wasn’t doing me any good. The anti-depressant alone (with no Lithium, etc., to hold down my mania), would excite my brain and throw me into mania. It would also cause me to have anxiety attacks. Why the psychiatrists couldn’t ask me if I had mania (do you ever have a racing mind?) when I came in as depressed, is hard to understand. But I had several of them who failed to see that. So if you ever do see a psychiatrist, don’t assume they are going to get it right. Keep these things in mind if you do see a psychiatrist, including if you go in as depressed, so you can say, “Oh, but I also have some of the signs of mania, such as…” and give him your reasons for believing you might be 
bipolar. Also, also, also, tell them your therapist believes you might be bipolar. That should do it. My mother’s mother had bipolar and that’s who I got mine from. Did you say you had a relative who might be bipolar? You give an interesting description of this, saying, “From within the 2nd session, she has been recommending me to see a psychiatrist for medication. I am TERRIFIED. I am very much afraid of change. But I do know that I do not want to live with the way my emotions are, especially days leading up to and during my feminine cycle. She even recently stated ""Now I don't want to you think that just because you have a certain disorder that it defines who you are, because it does not... I truly believe you have bi-polar and should be tested for it"" Webmd.com said the symptoms of mania include: • Excessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement; Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile; Restlessness; Rapid speech and poor concentration; Increased energy and less n
eed for sleep • Unusually high sex drive; Making grand and unrealistic plans; Showing poor judgment; Drug and alcohol abuse; Becoming more impulsive; Less need for sleep; Less of an appetite; Larger sense of self-confidence and well-being; Being easily distracted During depressive periods, a person with bipolar disorder may have: • Sadness; Loss of energy; Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness; Not enjoying things they once liked; Trouble concentrating; Forgetfulness; Talking slowly; Less of a sex drive • Inability to feel pleasure; Uncontrollable crying; Trouble making decisions; Irritability; Needing more sleep; Insomnia; Appetite changes that make you lose or gain weight You can check out some of these sites yourself by typing in “bipolar” into the search engine. Again, you said, “I am TERRIFIED. I am very much afraid of change. But I do know that I do not want to live with the way my emotions are, especially days leading up to and during my feminine cycle.” There is a saying about change 
which says, “Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.” (_NAME_, 1818, Frankenstein) Sometimes we are our own worst enemy. It’s like 10 people are keeping you from getting help. Really, there is only one, yourself. I had that, myself, for many years, that’s why I’m an expert on it. My negative unconscious was coming up with good reasons why I should treat myself bad, just like I had programed it to from child hood training or from bipolar, or from both. I had to be taught how to be positive, and then I quit sabotaging myself. There is another quote which says, “Strength comes from your vulnerability, and being able to step outside of your pride, your protective shell, your fear and say, ‘I need help.’ — _NAME_, It’s Okay To Ask For Help, You Know. It’s good that there is a website such as this so we don’t even have to leave home to get help. It’s good that people have the strength to write in. Can your wonderful therapist recommend a psychiatrist? Can she 
give you his or her phone number? Or, can you look up on the search engine “psychiatrists for your hometown” and write down a few of the numbers? You can get a male or a female psychiatrist. Unless your next appointment is far off, I would get a recommendation from your therapist, or call in and tell the secretary you’d like a recommendation for a psychiatrist. Maybe one male, one female, and take your choice."

175978593,"Humans tend to normalize behaviors of close intimates, tucking certain responses and behaviors into folders labeled: “Just the way he is” or “So typical of her.” We do that because, in the moment, we chose to stay in the relationship, even though the sailing isn’t always smooth. Some of the time, we fail to recognize that we’re actually excusing behaviors that should never be tolerated. People with insecure attachment styles whose emotional needs weren’t met in childhood do this more often and for longer than securely attached people who are much more likely to call out hurtful behavior because, for them, it’s anomalous. Those who were used to being marginalized, ignored, mocked or picked on in their childhood homes are much more likely to normalize or excuse bad behaviors. It’s a bit like the pile of boots and shoes by the front door that you get so used to that alas you no longer see it. (For a more in-depth discussion of how this affects unloved daughters, see my new book, Daug
hter Detox:Recovering from an Unloving Mother and Reclaiming Your Life. Tools of manipulation and power All of these behaviors are ways of exerting control over you, and are signs of an imbalance of power in the relationship, as well as clues to the other person’s motivations. Some of them are more obvious than others but the real key is whether or not you’re calling them out for what they are or whether you’re pleasing, appeasing, rationalizing, denying, or making excuses. We all need to take responsibility for whether or how we tolerate behaviors that shouldn’t be a part of anyone’s emotional landscape.

175978603,"UPDATE: Hi folks - I thought I should check in and let you all know how things have transpired in the past couple of weeks. After sticking with the Brupopion for three weeks, and averaging 2 to 3 hours of sleep a night, I had had enough and insisted on speaking to my doctor for a change in prescript ions. That was on Nov 19th. Unfortunately, when I contacted the clinic, I learned that my PCM was out on vacation for a couple of weeks, but they were kind enough to let me come in and speak with another doctor. The new doctor was very attentive and listened to what I had to say, including my suggestions for alternative drugs and requesting a thyroid blood test. Although he completely sympathized with me and and the major insomnia problems I was having, he felt that replacing the Trazodone with Remeron was a bit premature. He felt that the Buproprion was the cause of my insomnia and he replaced that prescript ion with Lexapro. Within two days of stopping the _PERSON_, my sleep improved tremendously. I c
ontinue to track my sleep on a CBT-i application I have on my phone and my sleep efficiency over the past few days has exceeded 80%. I am consistently getting 6 or more hours of sleep a night. Today, I had a follow-up with that new doctor as he wanted to see how I was doing on the new meds. Since I am doing well, at least for right now, he recommended I stay on the Lexapro / Trazodone combo for the next six months at which time we'll do another follow-up and possibly look at possibly reducing these meds. While at the clinic today, I also had some lab work done to (1) Check my thyroid levels, and (2) Check my vitamin D levels (which were considerably low during my last physical in Feb, 2019. So that's where I am. I'm still not sure if I really have an anxiety / stress / depression problem. All that I know is that I'm getting sleep at night, and I can't ask for any more than that. _PERSON_ - Colorado Springs"

Update: 6th June 2019 My wife just said very coldly that she is moving out and she can take her meds on her own without my help. I know that she will stop taking(because she doesn't want to gain weight) and her hypomania will develop into full-blown mania... She says we don't communicate anymore but when I showed her all the messages I sent her the past 3 weeks with no reply from her, she looked confused and went all silent. She said I'm never at home, but this morning and afternoon, I spent time with her...and I had to go work...she knows all this...so not sure why she suddenly said this. All of a sudden, she told me to stop beating her. I was stunned and shocked. I said my hand wasn't even near her...then she told me to stop beating her again...and looked very hurt by me...I totally don't understand...I have never ever lifted a finger on her... I tried to remind her of our love but I think the Bipolar doesn't let her feel it...she's 
changed into a completely different person...someone who looks at me with malice and distaste...and orders me around...and makes me pay for everything... She has memory loss also...in the morning, she asked me to bathe in Shokobutsu body foam, but we last used that brand at least 7-8 years ago...she even asked me how we met in the first place... Last night at about 3+am, I was awakened by her...she was having a conversation with someone who wasn't there...her hair covered her whole face...couldn't see her face at all...it was rather scary... At this point, only God can help me...and that is only if He so chooses to... I wanted to retain my dignity, so I told my wife that she can move out if she wants to. I said my conscience is clear. The last time this happened (before our first divorce), I begged her like crazy and it didn't work...so I figured she won't change her mind either... Extremely physically and mentally drained... I think in her manic state, she will file for divorce..so what I experienced 3 years 
ago, will eventually happen again...I don't want to divorce her...I love her with all my heart... : _ _ / Deep down beneath the bipolar, she loves me too...she hugged me to sleep 2 nights ago and said she loved me...

I am schizoaffective and a former R.N. I remember in nursing school, during my psychiatric nursing rotation, during rounds, the psychiatrist would get all the students and staff together to discuss the psychiatric patients. Each patient was discussed individually and each patient was picked apart, ridiculed and made fun of. Especially the middle aged and older female patients. With the doctor cracking all the jokes and laughing the loudest. I was horrified but I kept my mouth shut as I wasn't a part of the mental health system yet."
175978612,I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 after a suicide attempt in 2018.

175978616,"Hi there I am a somewhat functioning BI-Polar 2 with social anxiety, eating disorder history, and depression. My husband and I have been on a roller coaster ride for quite some time. In terms of your husband, I’m sorry to say but medication is needed. Treated similar to type 1, the medication process can be hard but in the end is worth it. Only a psychiatrist can truly diagnose and prescribe, and they are there to help not hurt. A bi polar talk therapist could also help to truly break down those barriers of honesty with both self and family. I also always advocate that spouses seek therapy as well. Bipolar anything can be extremely harmful, and as my husband and I discovered, there is a very thin line between helping and enabling. We had to learn this line together, and it we are still working to understand the pain that can come from crossing and creating that line, Also, i’m tempted to ask why is he saying no to treatment? Is he truly worried about his creative process- or is he just afraid? 
And what past experience is driving that fear? I always had a reason not to get help. In the end I was just really scared."

175978619,"Your story sounds very complex and I resonate with it on a lot of levels. It sounds like it is overwhelming and a lot to think about. Can you focus on one day at a time, to start. Is there anything that you enjoy doing, just for the pure joy of doing it? Like reading, or art, maybe coloring, or writing? I have a lot of anxiety around social situations and pushing myself outside my comfort zone too, and I find that I am able to recharge, at least a little, from doing a calming solitary activity. Usually focusing my mind on something simple and light-hearted helps to sooth a worried mind. Maybe try not to focus on fixing anything or figuring anything out right now and just give yourself some space to breathe. Sit outside and enjoy nature. That always helps me. I would also encourage you to keep talking to a therapist and work on learning how to value yourself more and how to process and express your emotions in a healthy way. In my experience, I've turned myself into a pretzel trying to get people to 
like/accept me but I am finally starting to discover that I have to accept who I am first. Also, remember that this is a process and it takes a lot of time and patience. There is no deadline or urgency, you can do it in your own time. Have faith!! Also, prayer is powerful, if you are religious/spiritual and that resonates with you."
175978620,"_AT_MENTION_ and WA, I was told on the video chat last year that I should stop my meds and that ""Once you're a slave to the psychiatric system, you can't get out"" + All of the screwed up things they've said to me, I became in denial of psychosis and lowered my Invega injection from every 3 weeks to 4 weeks. Now it's back on every 3 weeks because it has been a disaster. My mom told me that she notices a change in me at the end of my injection and I didn't listen. I listened to people that didn't even know me."
175978621,"IDK why but lately (last six months or so) my hair has been more oily. My Mom has been commenting on it. It is making me upset really. I only wash my hair every other day because all of my stylists have said it is not good to wash it every day and because it is hard enough to talk myself into washing my hair. So I pretty much will wash it on an every other day schedule. Once in a while every third day. So I got a clarifying shampoo and tried it this morning to see if it makes my hair less oily. We'll see. I was reading online and it said not to over do it with the clarifying shampoo because it can lead to your hair overreacting and getting more oily. I'm frustrated with my Mom for continually pointing out that my hair is oily. I feel like I am doing the best I can. I am doing so well in so many other areas. And I was thinking the only thing that has changed in six months is the supplements that I take when I feel like taking them, fish oil and Omega something. I don't know if that could be causing 
my hair to be more oily but my mom is getting on my nerves about my hair. Plus it has been summer here and hot so of course my hair is going to sweat. Or my head. Ugh. I don't know what else to do."
175978622,"Thank you and have checked out the resources. However, I still experience the feeling of a lump in my throat which started last week; it is a horrible feeling.

I love the cat channel, the gaming channels, plus they have live news. All for free. Don’t even need to sign up to watch. Saw a channel on there about naturescapes and whatnot, SP. We won’t get certain things. Like local news but it has Dallas news. Plus i was watching news in New York and LA which is really cool. They have some of the most unique channels I’ve ever seen on a free or even paid streaming tv company."
175978625,"Hi :) This took a lot of courage to post, and reach out. I commend you for your strength to do so! First, I want to let you know there is absolutely nothing wrong with you. Each individual is different, and they battle different struggles. I am sorry to hear the way your mom is acting. You deserve to feel validated and heard, and I can understand that you are not receiving that right now. Your mom may also have anxiety, but each person deals with their struggles differently, do not be ashamed in how you deal with yours. When I am feeling axious, I take some 'me time' I unplug from all technology and I sit outside and just take everything in. Appreciating the small joys of life and feeling at peace with myself. I don't know this your bag but, working out is also the greatest stress/anxiety reliever. This can really be helpful! Thank you again for reaching out, you are not alone."

175978627,"hi, i’m in high school, but i relate to what you’re going through. i’ve had a lot of “good friends” betray me and leave me with no one. i’ve been in your shoes where all i do is isolate and stay on my phone and stay away from everyone, because i feel there is no one to trust. the way i overcame that and am still working on it, is i make myself be around people, even if i don’t want to. when my parents started seeing me depressed and staying in my room all the time, they made it so i could only be by myself in my room for 30 minutes a day. i hated this idea because i would rather be by myself than around anyone. i didn’t think it was fair because i don’t like anyone in my house and i didn’t want to talk to them. but it kind of started helping. another thing that helps me is medication. i’ve had my meds switched a bunch, but when i found the medication i am on right now, i started feeling a lot better and i started being more social. i think what you need is just some people who 
can guide you into the right direction without leaving you or judging you, someone you can vent to or talk to when you’re feeling this way. i will be that person for you, if you’d like. much much love and support to you"

175978647,"Seems like a lawyer or paralegal might be the only way you can get through that logjam. Although the lawyers might be concerned about going up against the DA and the police chief, because as the prospective lawyer might say, ""I have to work in this town!"" Meaning, he's not going to make much money if he takes on those people. Meaning he might be taking your money, but he could be working for those two people. But this doesn't seem right. There's suppose to be separation of powers. In that, if the police chief is crooked, the DA ideally should be in a position to stop that. And a lawyer should be able to expose that. Can you contact a Paralegal, by looking in the computer pages for that, and just ask her opinion over the phone or on E-Mail, or ask how much an appointment would cost, or maybe the first appointment is free, a lot of lawyers are like that, and just ask her, what can be done here? 1 2"

174373120,"After the whole snapcat ordeal I ended up i the hospital for the 4th time. Again was a waste... they didn't want to address the whole anxiety I was having and decided to change my meds from saphris to abilify pill until I got out of the hospital and did the injections. I ended up getting the first shot and was suppose to take it before the 2 week was over. My case manager said she'd take me to the clinic that day. Well after 2 weeks and me calling her and leaving voice mails she didn't come to the house to pick me up and take me there to get the injection. So I was running out of pills and it took like a week of not being on an antipsychotic to being able to get in and get the one shot again and the other shot. I told my case manager boss I wanted a new one after all these ""miscommunications"" she has had with me. THey wouldn't give me another case manager because their turn over rate is high and can't get ""enough"" case managers. Total ********. I've been complaining to them about her since I go
t her. I want her *** fired. so I didn't end up in a group home BUT I did move out to my best friends brothers place. I'm around more people and although my anxiety hasn't gone away as far as eating goes (I've been eating way less because of anxiety but I'm pretty sure switching meds played a big part of it and lost a few pounds since then). Still hearing demons and spirits telling me to cut myself and give them my blood. At one point was telling me to kill myself and others. I'm still struggling. I still haven't had a new counselor but I want to take a break with the counseling right now.I just don't have reliable resources to do so. So being at my best friends brothers place i found out the guy I talked to about a year ago and had sex with and thought we where ""together"" was calling me a psycho and making fun of my mental illness and according to my best friends uncle (who I'm also fighting with) said I looked like a man (and the fat bastard said he wasn't wrong lmao **** you too boy). I ended up in my _P
ERSON_ family drama because I prank called them and made a fake facebook account and just to screw with him and as a way to get back at him for screwing over my friend by having her take out a loan for them and take out over 600 dollars that she has to pay back and claim they will ""pay her back"". She has two boys and a boyfriend who isn't working right now and is in a job slightly over minimum wage. So I gave her 180 dollars, said she can keep the 50 she owes me, and offered to donate plasma for her (before knowing that a schizophrenic dx disqualifies you from donating) and give her the money I got there. My bff's uncle said it was ""none of my business"" like hell it isn't. I'm giving her money (I told her she didn't have to pay me back) to help with the bills stuff so she can get caught up and it not ruin her credit. boy was I pissed."

Well, muting might be ok to an extent, even reasonable. But being afraid of feelings to the point of shutting them off or nearly silencing them isn't the best solution over the longterm. Seems reasonable since, above, you stated your afraid of your feelings."

People don't look down on you for diabetes. They shouldn't for depression or anxiety either. I take medications that work for my condition. When we take medications that work, we can seem normal. Whatever that is. Who wants to be normal anyway? I think in time there will be people that understand and don't look at you strangely. But for now I guess it just is what it is. I am glad we have a place to come to discuss it. It makes us all feel not so alone. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175978689,"Okay so first, marriage counseling, like yesterday. Second, he (or you for him) needs to talk to his doctor and explain his deterioration. By no means are you “responsible” for his mental health. It’s not your job to babysit his mood swings. I would make sure he eats at least once a day and that he still goes to work. Otherwise, he’s an adult and can manage his own health. One caveat of course is if he starts hurting himself, or you, or he starts hallucinating. Then it’s time for a trip to the ER/Mental hospital. Good luck. I’m sorry you’re going through this."
175978690,Hi Welcome to the forum but sorry to hear you are struggling at the moment. It seems to be the norm that when you start medication things get worse before they start to get better again and this period is usually between 2-4 weeks. In the meantime you need to do all you can through self help techniques to help reduce your anxiety we have some good links in our resources section so take a look I can highly recommend the Mindfulness links as I fins them really helpful myself.

Someone said, ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the pandemic increases everyone's anxiety. I've been reading a book about seniors, Elderhood by _NAME_, MD, in which she describe some of the in-and-out-take-a-number doctor's visits these days. It's difficult to find the kind of help one needs to cope. I've been on anti-anxiety medication (40 mg citalopram) for a decade, which has helped to rebalance my brain chemistry. I've also done a lot of work in addition to this to keep anxiety at bay. It's worked pretty well, but there are still days that are difficult.

174373203,"The only reason that I was diagnosed with schizophrenia is because; The psychiatrist decided to medicate me to prevent further psychosis because I was psychotic and the psychosis would have perpetuated into full blown schizophrenia. If he didn't diagnose me with schizophrenia, I would have developed schizophrenia.. Which is the same thing as having a predisposition to schizophrenia. Without antipsychotics, with time, I would have developed schizophrenia - But I needed to be diagnosed and tricked into having schizophrenia to conform to the scare tactics that are true in order to comply to medications. If it worked, I would eventually figure out what is real on my own. I can be cured, with time (They said by age around 25). I truly believe this. They caught it early. I know this because of the thoughts that I've been having.. The end of the injection and the start of the injection has made me rationalize both sides every 3-4 weeks for almost 5 years. So in order to be cured, you have to go through a 
little psychosis in intervals on an injection and not stop meds in pill form, going into too much psychosis in intervals for that long of a time. The posts that I've been making on Facebook about futuristic thoughts on how to make telepathy real and keep secrets by combining the technology with cryptography and using arithmetic number theory as well as the psychedelic trip - The head psychiatrist writing down ""PDD-NOS"" on my medical admission papers, - All of these combined to make me realize what is real and what isn't.

I'm in discomfort and pain. I'm feeling alone. I've undergone so many tests and procedures and spent so much money. And I'm not better nor have I found one person to say, ""Hey, I'm not sure what this is, but I'm willing to stick with you to help you figure it out.""

175978726,"Hi, I have found that moods ebb and flow with time, depending on life circumstances. However, when there is a prolonged feeling of being down, listless, not caring about anything, or a feeling of emptiness inside, it is depression. There are treatments that really work. Depression is often due a chemical imbalance in your brain that can be addressed with the right medication. It is no different than getting a pair of glasses to be able to see clearly. I strongly encourage you to be evaluated by a doctor."
175978727,"I second oceanfisher. In most cases tinnitus is age related and there's little that can be done about it. At least that's what I read and what an audiologist told me after I got tinnitus, some ten years ago. Usually, people get used to it, but that may take time."

175978732,"Yes I find myself counting everything. Things that dont need to be counted at all. Like how many steps I'm taking, or when I'm making stuff at work. It's so annoying but my therapist said what If I just let my brain count and dont fight against it. So I'm trying that out"
175978733,"So I was going to wait on this until it was all confirmed and I was ready to go, but I’ll tell you because I told a couple of my real life friends this evening at dinner. I’ve decided to go back to school part time online university while working pursuing a math degree. Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics. It aligns with some career goals I have and since it aligns with my jobs business bottom line (a lot of data analysts jobs involve math degrees) my job will reimburse me a portion of my courses every year. I’ve applied and am waiting for them to evaluate my last college transcripts to see if I can transfer credits but I should be starting in April hopefully. I’m excited. My doctor and my therapist are proud of me and see I’m excited. So yeah that’s big for me! I’m going to be the broke university student for a while."

175978735,"Cleaned my room and had cold shower. Doing 3 day water fast but my moms friend wants to pick me up at 5 to go grocery shopping to pick out food to make for dinner. I used to be doing nothing really depressed, drugs and overdosing. But now I'm actually doing so many things and my mind is active. I blame the psychedelic trip."
175978736,"Honestly I don’t know. They send him to these placements for 3 months. Which is I guess the limit. His probation officer has asked for a 30 day extension this time because she knows that he is not ok to come home. He is a huge manipulator and with him being 15 he knows how to work the therapist. He knows that if he says what they want him to say then they will write down that he is being good, he is doing what he is being asked, etc. They won’t see through him. Which blows my mind considering they are therapist. Thankfully the one he has now, can see through him and see that he is just doing and saying whatever to get out. I know his probation officer is trying to get him placed in a more intense placement but I don’t know how that’s going to work out just yet."
175978737,"I'm not gonna go over everything I dealt with that led to my PTSD, as I don't want to trigger anyone or make anyone feel sad! But I'm just wondering if anyone else dealing with PTSD also struggles to properly feel their emotions? And does anyone have tips? I feel like I'm in this weird ""survival"" mode where I do everything I need to do (wake up, brush my teeth, go to work, etc.) But everything mostly feels kind of emotionless. I might have a burst of emotion but then it's gone. I even find it difficult to cry unless I feel safe enough. Anyone else struggling with something similar? And has anyone found any good workarounds/tips? I don't wanna suppress my emotions, I know that's not healthy, but it's not something I'm intentionally doing or even choosing to do at this point. It's like I'm in a constant state of paranoia and maybe therefore I feel unsafe to feel my emotions. Much love! <3 Stay positive y'all. We will figure this thing out together. Thanks in advance for any responses. :)"
175978738,"That ****ing sucks but hey I don’t need to say that do I? I get it, actually, I’ve had more than my fair share of interpersonal drama this year too. Gah, it’s tiring and yep mental stability loves to start disappearing on you when you need it the most. Pfft."
175978739,"_AT_MENTION_! We love you! You're doing really really good. Way much better than how you were. It's ok to take a break and catch up on things later. I don't know how you do it - But you do it.. I can't imagine what it must take to be able to focus/ignore all of the things that you're doing like that. For me, I have an extremely hard time finishing things almost as bad a starting things. Most people have problems finishing things but no problem starting things. There's bad things happening - With the world, your mental health, the future, etc.. Idk if you struggle with the past as much as I do - I don't think about it as much anymore because new problems have arisen and I'm focused on those. You don't have to always maintain a steady stability of what you do - Putting yourself out there.. I could possibly do that too but not now. I'm doing self improvement right now - I might not even be known by anyone who knows.. Maybe I'll just be a monk or something... But even today, people on the internet have 
said ""You're interesting - I'd really like to see more of this (Writing)"". You are an amazing, interesting, smart person that has overcome a great deal of what happened in your life. Don't let depression/sadness get you down. I was pretty sad, then happy, then sad, then happy all night - Light chemical use - But what matters is the parts of the brain that the chemicals are effecting - The parts that need to be dealt with. I always have good insights by staying up all night - It appears that you are the same way. I had a realization today that ""happiness is real"". It's profound to me. Also, be careful of letting other marketing companies or labels taking a piece of the pie. Some people take like 40% of the profit for the rest of your life. It's called ""Hollywood.. Something"".. I forget the name.. I have terrible memory recall after being awake for a while."

Psychiatrists are ordinary people with exceptional intellects to be where they are. You wouldn’t want a regular _NAME_ mechanic or _NAME_ engineer to diagnose you?

175978764,"Could Auditory Hallucinations be thought of in terms of as a type of harassment as in theory voices goad and harass us daily? We have to live our lives with what to me seems like a death _USER_ID_ Twitter storm, spewing out Narcissistic abuse towards us, some of this abuse mimics emotional blackmail, entrapment, Bait &Switch grooming techniques. It could be thought of as a strange form of revenge by a hidden foe of Witches or sick *****es. It occurred to me that being on the receiving end of 'Voices' seems to draw a comparison to Cyber Abuse/Hazing/mobbing by its design and function. Would any voice hearer agree with this personnel observation as many will experience different varying degrees of harassment, also could you have nice harassment, for the ones that say their 'voices' are a rich source of encouragement, as there will be of course. So, would it be madness to class the 'Voices' or Auditory Hallucinations as a form of unwanted constant Harassment? Also of some interest would be the idea th
at the 'Voices' in a sense Stalk us as they are always there, even in the loo. So would the concept of stalking & harassment be applied to the experience of hearing voices?"

Life is short, and they really have to do what is right for them. My mother was bi-polar and she was not a very nice person. Though I know she was sick I chose to stay away from her because being around her was damaging my mental and physical health. I have diabetes and being around her was very stressful for me and it affected that part of my life. My blood sugars went out of control. Plus the way she treated me affected me emotionally. So there are some situations that warrant leaving the situation. I am glad you have resources that make you able to live with this situation. I mean it sounds like you are financially stable for when she decides to go shopping. You have the patience to tolerate everything. But make sure it is safe for her without having to have supervision. If she needs hospitalization, make sure she gets it. I hope that things 
continue to be okay. Keep hanging in there but don't forget to take care of you. And for the ones who can't stay any longer, don't feel guilty for having to take care of yourselves. Hugs, _NAME_..."

174373243,"My mind is so open now that I'm open to anything - But need to stay grounded. I just love talking and writing about magic, reality, consciousness, science and logic - It's all valid. You just need to a good sense of self - In order to relate the environment to yourself and trust your own mind, use the right patterns - Don't listen to your own nonsense. It's mostly brain chemicals. I had psychosis 3 nights ago and took 7.5mg of olanzepine and I was completely fine after that. Yet, I find the psychosis interesting because ""I"" thought of it - How I can relate it to my past, present, future.. If I could do something great - Pronoia and paranoia at the same time.. Running away from intrusive thoughts but also towards something great - Being connected to the spirit all knowing matrix grid. I can get caught up in my own thoughts and seem crazy to people around me - I fear my mom would walk in and ask me what's wrong and I'd have to say ""I'm psychotic"". It's horrible. Psychosis is horrible - But so man
y people are interested in it because it gives clues to how bizarre reality is - People looking for meaning, trying to be happy, how to get over pain, society and it's addiction to dopamine, satan, religion, technology and time travel, consciousness... I'm so interested in everything but I know I'm sick - So I take my meds. It's not like I'm not allowed to be interested in my own thoughts - I just can't go too deep into mystery or else I may never come back.. Brain cells will die because the dendrites form wrong connections. In the psych ward, I met some really sick people.. One in particular was so psychotic constantly that it seemed as if he was tripping.. The hospital psychologist said ""He's has an extremely severe form of schizophrenia"".. He asked me if I did LSD and mushrooms and I said ""Yes"" and I asked if he did and he said yes. He didn't believe that I did so he got up, twirled around and danced away. We have to take care of our minds. I think it's very rare to have such openness - Most people hav
e strong religious convictions or atheists, depressed - The other one is psychosis or mania, brain injury etc.. But I will be here for you guys. I hope that what I say doesn't make anyone's psychosis worse - I try to reassure and give support - Just like when I need it.. If I need to just write it out.. My family is really supportive of me.. I don't want to end up homeless on the street. It could easily happen. My mom could have kicked me out but she would never do that. She was always supportive (Although distracted at times) and never got mad at me for trying to cope with so many drugs.. She just took them away and gave me a hug. All I needed was a hug. I didn't want to die so usually I'd walk upstairs, crying and say ""Please flush these drugs for me - I'm not happy with what I'm doing to myself"" or something. I'd listen to songs - And most songs don't glorify drugs. Sure, musicians made good songs with heroin for example but a lot said that they waited like 15 years and could have made better music."

175978777,"Guys I really want to go into the realm without being considered psychotic. I don't want to lose touch with reality.. my mind.. The mind is the most precious thing to anyone. Going into psychosis is the most horrible thing that can happen to anyone. But stories told over thousands of years, what humanity has become, the animals, me... Everything is ok. It really is. People love each other. People hate each other. When was the last time you cried? You will cry again.. It's all just a trip. And it's beautiful, sick, twisted, aweful, magical. Sorry this is my therapy.. I don't mean to say these things but I feel.. I feel emotions right now.. Just ignore me I'm ok.."

175978781,The past week has sucked bad. I am under intense amounts of stress. Like I haven’t experienced since my last break. Tomorrow is my fil’s burial. While it will be a relief to finally put him to rest it will be emotional. My daughter is giving a eulogy. I will likely self-medicate before the service. Right this minute my anxiety is reserved for my _NAME_. I think he’s showing symptoms of his Lyme disease. We just started giving him Doxy last night when it was delivered. He puked about 30 minutes after taking it last night. He didn’t throw up with either dose today but he’s definitely not himself. I’ve also noticed a “hunch” I hadn’t previously seen. I can’t tell for certain if it’s the dreaded kind of hunch or just him being awkward. His tail isn’t hanging so I’m hoping it’s just goofiness. Bringing him back to the vet Saturday after breakfast w/gram.
175978782,One thing that _PERSON_ told me was to take breaks.. I never try to take breaks. She says she'll take like 10 breaks a day. I should definitely do that - Plan increments of activities like 20 minutes for each... I can't focus on one thing for over an hour that's ridiculous.

175978785,"Hello Rich: You may have Agoraphobia or you may be Housebound. It can happen with depression or Anxiety. Sometimes when people are usually tired and/or in pain, it may happen then also. The symptoms are somewhat ridiculous sometimes, however. There are supposedly only 3% of the U.S. with this condition. I find that hard to believe. There are most likely way more. Just that the patients don't mention this problem to their Doctors. If you have a disability or are a Senior, you can look on the net in your area to have a volunteer walk with you to a park or to visit someone nearby, etc. There are also volunteer drivers which you would pay a small amount to go a certain distance. Usually, cheaper than a Taxi, to pick up groceries or buy clothing, go to medical appointments, play cards at a Senior's center, etc. I know that it is easier with your own vehicle but if you don't want to be caught up in traffic( I don't blame you), it would be another resource. If you have a Therapist, Psychiatrist, Psycholog
ist or Counselor, they should be able to help you with this info also or to get someone else to find it for you, if you cannot find the company or government agency, yourself. I'm only suggesting them, if you want them. You could also ask family or friends, of course."

When we went to Japan for example, he only bought himself one _USER_ID_ wallet and that’s all. He’s a man with vision. Very selfless and he puts my needs before his.

If only his *** got caught by my uncle and him knowing what he did to me he might be dead. I don’t fear him as much as jealousy because he’s doing alright while I’m in limbo. **** him and his old looking *** girlfriend. What concerns me is he has picture of a little girl on there. Around the age range I was abused. Scary as ****....
175978812,Hi _PERSON_ I would suggest that you just try and get out for a walk every day start of short and gradually build up over a few days or weeks this will help both your anxiety and mood.

175978827,I went into a hotel owned by a group of hotels and asked for the managers name on the application and they said that she was in another hotel so I walked out. Then a woman came running out saying the manager just came to the hotel that I was at and said she never comes there. So we did a small interview for a position at the other hotel that she works at and she was talking about me working full time but I said that I wanted to work part time so she left and then said she will call me back. 16 days since my last cigarette! My lungs feel clear. I put my 750mg CBD into 30x 25mg capsules. I bought 7g of CBD and will put it into 280x 25mg capsules so it will last like 6 months. I'll save 500 dollars because it's on sale instead of just buying bottles of 30x 25mg capsules because I bought my own capsules and have a mg weighing scale. It helps with muscle relaxation. I have to be stoned to put them into capsules or else I get bored. It's like a meditation thing. I also bought pineapple express wax for my 
DMT pen. I feel really off though. My thoughts aren't coming together and I constantly need inspiration.

175978829,"That lockdown at work through January sends a skeletal chill down my spine. I've had to face the possibility that this place may not let us smoke/vape anymore, it's been about 8 weeks, the smokers probably will try to stay quit and it will be just me and my precious, the voopoo drag. Maybe there will still be a smoker or two who will want to keep smoking. But with this physical therapy, it's a sign that they might be relaxing the quarantine. I am so hoping. They did let me go outside for a few minutes with two other residents. That was nice, if only I'd been allowed to use my vape."

175978866,"Had a very severe panic attack last night. I think it was because of the _PERSON_. Not taking that again. I told my mom to kick her bf out because I couldn't stand the way she talks and the way he talks it reminds me of abuse or stockholm syndrome. She reassured me that it wasn't like that way. I got depersonalization because I was trying to focus outside in the cold while the Vyvanse was wearing off. I didn't want to hear anymore of the drama so I told my mom to keep it down and I walked away, she still continued. I closed my door but the cat was OUTSIDE THE DOOR. So the cat started meowing at my mom and she was ignoring - What do I do in that situation? I lie on my bed, breathing with my hand on my chest - Panting.. intense panic forming ""The door will be opened"" so I opened the door and came to my mom and said ""I don't know what you are"" and not making much sense backing away from her and she said I'm being rude or something.. I don't give a **** about what is rude or not. I never did. I don
't connect with social culture but I've learned to abide over time. She said that I'm not well and got her bf to leave. I couldn't look at her in the eyes - My eyes were jotting around my vision - It was complete lack of focus. I couldn't focus. I told her that I took L-Tyrosine to replenish my dopamine because I couldn't focus. I wasn't making any coherent sense at all - Just ""I don't know what is real because of all the things"" I said I just wanted to go to sleep. So I tried to go to sleep, took 1.5mg of alprazolam - Had a thought that I would die in my sleep cuz I took phenibut but it was an irrational fear - and I knew that. So I went to drink chamomile tea again, watched the news and couldn't understand any of it. The benzo and zopiclone kicked in and I went to sleep. I woke up 6 hours of sleep or something. I could have a panic attack again when the Vyvanse wears off and I can't focus. It's ****ing hell. I went to work though. Had a good day at work. I'll take it easy today."
175978867,It's a blast.
175978868,"Hello, this is my first time posting here and I am not sure where else to turn. My wife and I have been together for nearly 9 years, married for almost 3. She has had depression/anxiety since being in high school, but only started seeing a counselor when we started dating. Things seemed to improve for a bit, but she has not been consistently to a counselor in a few years. I try the best I can to support her, and recently we moved cities because of my job. While we talked about it, and this was something she wanted (gave us the opportunity to buy a house and live somewhere else), it also required her to leave her position and pursue positions in the new city (same state). That was 11 months ago. Cue the pandemic. All jobs in her non-profit industry have dried up, and she wants that career because it is what she went to school for. She has a job working from home now, but wants to quit because it is not in her field, it promises long hours in the next month, and they are inflexible with Thanksgiving 
weekend. Being the breadwinner, I have a hard time seeing it from her point of view... I do not have the luxury of just leaving my job due to stress because we would be homeless. Even though I tell her I do not understand why she wants to leave (job seems pretty solid) I still support her decision to leave. She is upset I do not understand. She does not feel supported. I feel blamed that she is in this position because it was my job that made us move. That part really hurts. I support us, I pay for everything, I feel the emotional toll that she feels, but it is still somehow my fault she is in this position. What do I do? Marriage counseling seems good - we have been before for different reasons, but it is a tough thing to actually schedule and go through with. Any help or kind words are appreciated. It feels so lonely sometimes being in this position. She feels lonely too, for different reasons... Thanks"

175978871,"I don't understand why my pdoc wants to put me on Vraylar. I know that it's a new medication and has an indication for what I'm dealing with but I feel like Zyprexa does the trick for me. It does not seem wise to take me off of Zyprexa, which I began taking again a few days ago and from which I already feel an improvement. I think I would spiral downwards if I were to go off of Zyprexa. I am just not understanding this pdoc's reasoning. _USER_ID_: I guess, disregard this, because I realized the Zyprexa was causing high cholesterol and stuff that is bad. I probably should get off of Zyprexa then. _USER_ID_ 2: No, still not convinced I should get off of Zyprexa. Ha."
175978872,"Yeah, that's what I've been doing, playing Pokémon, taking a break right now, played a lot today. Might watch _NAME_ corwins _USER_ID_ documentary series, I find nature documentaries relaxing. . I think it's stress about getting the new apartment, it seems like I'll be getting it but who knows. And then the whole process of actually moving is stressful. It will be worth it but it still gives me anxiety."
175978873,"_AT_MENTION_ I think maybe ""agnostic"" was the wrong word. Perhaps ""vested interest"" would have made my point more clear. Most people say they want truth or an additional perspective, but what they want is for that to be their truth and their perspective. A good teacher, indeed a good thinker, is a person able to argue in favour of something they don't believe in. Knowing something to be right is the first indication that it's probably wrong; that you lack the whole perspective, as nothing is 100% true or right. Things are only right in context and people seem to be less interested in context. Someone once showed me an idea they used to convey perspective. They showed three people a photo of the same object, although no one could see the other's image. They were then asked questions about the object and none of them could agree on how many sides or shape etc. One saw a triangle, one saw a square and one a rectangle. In essence, they'd all been looking at a wedge of cheese, but the photo was take
n from different angles. There was no way that they would agree, as they were all 100% convinced that they were describing what they saw. What was missing was context, but the only way they could agree was for one of them to ""let go"" of their perspective and step over to the other so that they could see what the other person was seeing, making it clear. One of the most important things we possess is our opinion, but the value of the opinion has been lost to many through the idea of ""it's just my opinion,"" offered in such a way that it can be dismissed as having transient relevance. If an opinion is researched, placed in context and delivered with conviction then it's the most powerful tool a person can wield, but like all tools it needs to be carefully honed and used with care, precision and effect."
175978874,"With depression you can have a tool box like you do for anxiety. Mindfulness helps a lot.. Plus the breathing exercises as for anxiety also help. Depression and anxiety can also go hand in hand. They kind of feed off of each other. You get depressed because you get anxious and you get anxious because you are depressed. Ask your therapist about mindfulness or go to mindful.org. There are a lot of things that can help you there. I hope that the CBT helps. I had a book on it called ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. _NAME_. You may even want to look for it. I wish you the best. Have a good day. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175978875,"Dear Superfinnwoman, Having known and heard your story on Inspire for a while now, I still don't know if the source of your depression and suicidal thoughts are in the present or the past of both. If your therapist focusses only on the present, maybe she is not right for you. If you do keep going to her, can you decrease the 'keeping things to yourself?' If you still feel unworthy, that you are burdening people by telling your truth, then you need a therapist or counselor who is able to reinforce that you are worthy, not burdening people by telling what is hurting you and what you need, or letting them help you figure out what you need, and supporting you in asserting it. Any university with 50 or more employees is subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows you up to 12 weeks per year for medical reasons. It is not paid leave unless your employer allows you to accrue enough paid leave. Some states, at least mine, are starting to fund paid leave. I don't work any longer, but my brothe

I’ve had no coffee. _NAME_ is upset for some reason. I was supposed to goto my moms which is a almost 2 hour drive. And then go see someone who wanted to see me. But also my dad asked me last night to come by before all of that. Like around 11 or 10. And let me say, I was trying to sleep in. Cuz I never get good sleep anymore. I’m up late doing what I need to do. And then I have to wake up early. I shove coffee down my throat and my pills and I have to leave to work or something. Like I’m so exhausted. I just want to give up or stop or idk. I don’t have time to myself anymore. I don’t even remember what I did yesterday or the day before or before.

175978879,"That's a good point. Haha. I don't know why I always think of changing everything. Something I need to work on. Well I guess my pdoc wanted to change things, so that was why I thought of switching pdocs. It's like a recurrent thing with him I think, that he wants me on low amounts of medicine. But I feel like he has like amnesia or something because he always tries this stuff where he will lower my meds. And I'm left being like what? What are we doing?

All I did was chores every day for years - I never even used the internet or talked to anyone in real life most times. I had no friends. I was severely isolated - Then I started having positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The 10 minutes of talking to the owner of a video chat room was one of the worst times. He said I would end up as a serial killer so I should ""Get a dog"" and everyone else was like ""Yeah get a dog"". **** them. My mom, ex step dad and my real dad are all alcoholics.

175978892,My story begins before I turned 2...i was beaten and burned with cigarettes by my birth mother i was raped by her boyfriend repeatedly.. My sister and I were put into foster care by the time I was three where I was molested by one of the older boys. three months after I turned 5 my sister and I were adopted by a teacher and his wife.. That's when the real abuse started From both of my new parents AND by my biological sister who still after 30 years blames me for us being taken by the state and for the adoption . A few months after kindergarten started in 89 I was at the table eating dinner when I felt like I was going to throw up when I said so my mom told me to shut up and finish my food because we don't waste food when i just sat there my dad started yelling at me saying that i was just like my bio dad ungrateful and wasteful and if that's how I wanted to act they would change my name to his and start calling me by it I was terrified that if I ran to the bathroom i would get his belt and when I th
rew up on the dinner table thats what i got .. The early days were actually the best... To be continued

175978895,"Minipuff: So, you are on 60mg of Prozac which treats depression as well as anxiety. And your psychiatrist about two weeks ago added 10 mg of Buspar, which treats anxiety. You were still having trouble with sleep. How is all of that going now?"

175978897,Be careful after he praises you he’ll bring you down He does that with every type.
175978898,"My anxiety has been horrible for the past year or so and I haven't really been able to vent it in any way and for some reason its turned to harming myself or others even though I'm terrified of doing so. I went to the ER last month for this and they just gave me medication and sent me on my way, but its happening again and Im considering admitting myself (Im 19) is that the right choice?"
175978899,Thanks SP!
175978900,"Yes, you can feel moments of anxiety that become bothersome and still push through it. There should be more awareness about feeling the way you described, especially at your age. I'm not a Dr. - you just happen to sound like me when I was your age. Try simple things first like changing types of food/caffeine intake and refined sugars and salt. Stay hydrated enough with electrolytes and see how you feel in a few days. Emotionally sensitive types can have hypersensitivity and make adrenaline like no body's business. Again, just speaking generally and from my lifelong experience with coping, having high energy, overthinking, when being alone isn't fun. All of those attributes can be used in a good way too. You sound like you are very smart and know your body. Hormones will fluctuate and I think the next few years should balance out for you. Also, never feel weak to talk with a counselor or at least journal."
175978901,"Are they're any homeless shelters in your area? Salvation Army will take you in, I've heard. Covenant House in New York City, Atlanta and some other larger cities. That may be just for teens, but I would certainly check. A big step would be to get diagnosed as bi-polar and get on the needed medicine. Can a hospital emergency room tell you where some of the free clinics are? I would suggest going to the emergency room. They'll probably have a psychiatrist on call who can help you. If you can be positive in some of your lower moments it might help you meet your next goal.

175978911,"I am working 20 hours a week and have much stress. I have sza also. I have never been on disability but have been out of work for periods at a time. I want to be able to maintain working at 20 hours a week. It has not been easy though. I am doing ok but my job is not stable and pays by the hour. I like my job though. I wanted to receive SSDI but my shrink refused to help me get it. So, I decided to work and so far it is ok. I think I am ok but the stress is hard to deal with at times. I try to sleep on my breaks and whenever possible. I like being productive but don't like the stress. I am managing somehow. I like my job and get paid for it. It is not a great job but it pays the bills. I hope to increase my hours a little more to 25 hours a week but so far 20 hours has been a major chore for me. So, I will see if it is possible to increase or not my hours per week."
175978912,I feel like I’m a pushover... I’m nice to people and when I get upset it’s nothing but when someone else get upset at me I’m the terrible person. I’m also paranoid about people talking crap about me...
175978913,I’ll never be well again. I won’t. I give up trying to be well. All I ever do now is go in and out of psychosis. I’m fine for a week or two and then I’m back in psychosis for another few days or a week. Maybe this is who I am. School was not a good choice. Working is not a good Choice right now but I need extra money somehow.

175978915,"Hello everyone, This may end up being a silly post in retrospect but I want some feedback. Last night I overindulged in some alcohol (Vodka) and had way more than I intended to. I ended up having my first hangover ever. Normally I can control how much I drink but vodka is sneaky. Last night I threw up a few times. It was horrible. I didn't fall asleep until 4 am and woke up at 7. I felt nauseated this morning and still feel a bit queezy now but better. My question is how long will it take for me to completely recover from this. Also I am worried about lasting health damage. I've never been an excessive drinker as this is my first hangover. I plan on taking a month off from alcohol and seeing how my body feels. I have been drinking ginger tea and that has helped. I figure the first hangover is always the worst but this is a new experience for me. I forgot to add that I am a 28 year old in shape male."
175978916,"Having a glass of wine. The last alcohol I'm having after tonight for the next month or so while I get used to the new med. I just want to give the med a chance to work I tracked my stimulus payment on the IRS site and it said it's scheduled to be deposited into my bank account on the 17th, so St. _NAME_'s day."
175978917,"my mind clouds over occasionally, and my fantasies go to ground. cold corpses. eyes shut. sometimes, though, i'm awake. my fantasies a burning ember turning over in my core. i know they're impossible, but i yearn to act them out as if they were. they fill me up inside until my fingers twitch and i nearly go blind of reality. no, that's not right. reality is still there but it's not so important. the mundane fades as I squirm against my fantasies. they lift me up until i'm breathing great big gasps of air. my car careening wild like an animal, my sick twisted grin shining maniacally, and that greedy part of my soul is filling up as my eyes dilate. clawed fingers stretching from me, casting a shadow on ""realistic"" and scratching at the asphalt to be fed fantasies. to be the fantasy. dreams... i grasp at them unsuccessfully. sometimes i can almost taste them because their smell is so poignantly present. i'm chasing a dream right now. it's like sun rays on the horizon, beginning to change the color o
f the gray sky. yet, i've failed so much. so often. so continuously . i'm reaching with fervor. madly, unrealistically. sacrificing even other people's desire to get there. to keep pushing. i've given up before. right now though. i feel the pleasure building and i know there will be release soon. the clouds are hanging fat and ready to rain down my success."
175978918,Zopiclone worked surprisingly well. It made me hallucinate my thoughts a little bit like when you unplug one of those old computers and it takes a few moments to shut down.... I took 7.5mg but next time I'll only take 3.25mg unless I'm too awake. Going skiing this afternoon =] I rolled some joints. I'll smoke one on the way up.

And primal brain of cats when tripping with their empathy and intelligence is noticed when you trip with them.. and their exact facial symmetry is an evolutionary advantage to make them cute so we adopt and feed them.. And they probably know it too! We talked about AI and particle or plant consciousness and fear of death and the afterlife.. Idk if you call that productive... Idk.. My mom made a coffee for me and herself. I told her not to drink coffee because of her heart condition but she likes to have one every once and a while so I let her.. I told her to take her beta blocker and she did.. Just on her watch it shows arrhythmias when she drinks coffee.. Meh idk.."
175978920,"@ juli_raven8 - Thank you for the compliment and I understand what you mean, how for some the medication is necessity, but is it always? Sometimes. Sometimes not. (half of a half is pretty good!!). I do similar to you with what keeps some edge off. The _USER_ID_ placed upon mental health in America largely comes out of that fear of judgment you speak of... the looks and whispers one imagines (or not). It's time to step up and own it all without shame. The world is ill and depressed and discouraged and dismayed. If we, as individuals are then it should be no surprise, and it's okay to be struggling, to need comfort and support, but we must also look to ourselves and own our self-responsibility to not give up on ourselves, to not quit failing and falling and getting back up and try again and again. Needy is human but not insurmountable. This is not a one and done thing, it's life maintenance. And I think that people are less judgmental than appears. Family, friends, and strangers alike are dealing wi
th their issues, insecurities and fears at the same time regardless. I've found that not only talking to strangers rather than those close to us often can be a more mutually receptive environment because everyone can relate (theoretically) and is why this format and forum takes a lot of that pressure and anxiety away. When I say reach out to those that one loves or loves you, it's not to lay all the baggage at their feet, it's to do the good one can for themselves by showing others care and empathy, whether they requested it or not and even if you, yourself might need it more. It's for the giver as much as the receiver. The act of healing for others is, in fact. part of healing oneself. And then the of unpacking of a more unwieldy suitcase of emotions becomes a little easier for all. So, to me all your observations are spot on juli_raven, but we as individuals, as a country, and world collective community must not forget self-healing is required work for any steps towards significant recovery from the traumas 
of life. Own it and carry on without fear even if it's scary. We must be warriors for ourselves everyday. If not us, then who? - cres"

I think you should invest in some therapy or a psychiatrist. I'm pretty sure they can diagnose things too, and they can probably help with how you feel about your partner. I just want you to know that you're not alone. I go through such things too, needing constant reassurance, trust issues, past trauma. Thank you for sharing, and I hope that you get the help you need."

175978927,"I hear all the time about what music is considered to be ""manly"". A lot of people say it's metal, and I disagree with that. Sure, I greatly enjoy metal. It's not always my go to source for music, but I enjoy it. I really enjoy cold, raw black metal. Death metal is okay, I think it's overrated, but it's not bad. Power metal can be fun, but a lot of it sounds the same. However, I don't define it as the manliest music of all. Classical is my go to for musical pleasure, but it's not the manliest either, Though I do think some of the manliest men to ever live have sung opera You know what I think is the manliest music of all time? This and this . One song is singing about how tragic erectile dysfunction is (trust me, I know) and the other is singing about being in the armed services."

I am putting on a good face. Trying to play with my daughter, take the dog for a walk, do my job, clean my house, interact with my husband, but it is such a chore right now. All I want to do is stop. I want a break from life. A pause button. The truth is, my life is still very good. I have a job (I am working from home right now), which is more than I can say for some other people in food service (I do food service at the university).

175978960,Hi Folks How has your week been? Check in if you have the time. _PERSON_
175978961,"I'm so sorry to hear you are going through this. COVID is already not easy and for young people, it can make a difficult situation even worse. It seems like you're doing the right things, limiting screen time, exercising. Keep that up as that all helps. Is there something you enjoy doing before bed that will relax and soothe you? Perhaps listening to music, writing, drawing, or reading a book? I always curl up with a good book so that I can hopefully drift to sleep. If the anxiety wakes me up during the night however, it's hard and I have to pray. I use Psalms 94:19 to help me get through: ""When anxieties overwhelmed me, You comforted and soothed me."" It helps to have that outlet. If you're not religious however, the Scripture can still apply that it would help to find someone to talk to, someone comforting, kind, and patient so that you have an outlet to explain your feelings. Perhaps a friend or another family member? I hope you find some relief from your anxiety and peace of mind. Best wishes.

175978963,"Hello onlyitj: I noticed this is your first post here on PC. So... welcome to Psych Central. I'm sorry you find yourself to be in such a difficult situation. Hopefully coming here to PC can be of some comfort & support. One additional forum, here on PC, that may be of interest to you would be the Partners of People & Caregivers forum. Here's a link: https://psychcentralforums.com/partn...ivers-support/ You asked what you should do along with what will be in the best interest of your children. And how can you make sure you are safe. Unfortunately I have to say I don't think I am in a position to answer those questions. (Perhaps there will be other PC members who will feel they can.) My own thinking, with regard to this, is that what you may want to do is to talk all of this through at-length & in-depth with a mental health therapist of your own. One thing I was unclear about is if your wife is actually being treated at this point for her mental health concerns. You mentioned her having been diagnose
d. But then it sounds as though you moved to a different city. So perhaps she's not longer actively treating? If she is I would think you might want to see if you can make arrangements to consult with her service providers. (You'll likely need her permission to do so.) They are likely to be in the best position to advise you with regard to concerns such as your safety & that of your children. If your wife is not actively treating at this point in time, I would think getting her into active treatment would be imperative. Here are links to 9 articles, from Psych Central's archives, 7 on the subject of coping with someone who has delusions plus 1 on how to convince a loved one to seek professional care & 1 on how to help a loved one who is in denial: 10 Things You Should Know About Delusions | Caregivers, Family & Friends Coping With Your Loved One's Delusions | Caregivers, Family & Friends 8 Ways To Cope With Someone Who Has Delusions | Caregivers, Family & Friends 10 Things You Should Do With Someone Who Suffe

175978978,"Well, Happy Thanksgiving everyone, I'm very thankful for all here. The food today was horrible. I don't know what changed, but it went from excellent to inedible in not long of time. My Mom's food was horrible too, she's in a rehab place like where I am short term while she recovers from some issues. And I thought a lot about the friend I lost in the 2000's. I'm so regretful of that. Since then I've disappeared. Phone number, etc. To this day I don't know why I did that. Another charger and wall adapter was stolen today. And the original cord was tampered with. Someone cut the plastic to expose the wire in two places. I ****ing hate it here. I hope everyone is ok. _PERSON_, I hope your meds/med changes go well."
175978979,"The problem is "" FEAR ""! You fear of being negatively judged. You fear of being excluded...etc. Because they are SO many in comparison to us. And they know all this, playing on your fears all the time. Do u still have friends, or are u completely isolated? The problem is, you dont trust nobody, even in here. I trust what youre saying, why wouldnt you trust what im saying. Why would you be the only 1 in this position? We are many many thousands in this position, if not millions. You have to start having a life again, go back to who you were before all of this happend, because that is the real you."
175978980,"_NAME_, your story sounds very familiar to me as a sibling of a brother with serious mental illness. The 'system' is too difficult, as you say. Why did they let him out in 48 hours? Maybe it differs by state, but I thought the minimum 'civil commitment' was 72 hours. Was the doctor afraid of him, or something? I can't believe he spoke to you that way. But I should focus on your immediate situation. It is important that you and your dad are safe, and that you both are allowed to have a life. So if your brother is behaving as a threat to others, and not compliant with meds or treatment, you may have to call the police and tell them so. Hopefully they can get him into a better hospital, but maybe he will be on the streets. Are there any homeless shelters he can stay in? How does he get his Klonapin? He must have some connection to some provider? I'm sorry maybe this sounds harsh, but believe me I have been there. I may be able to say more if I knew your brother's approx. age and area of the country he 
lives in. Please do come back and say what is happening."

It can be changed to ""_PHONE_NO_ 0110 to continue as... You know what I mean"".. Kind of matrixy right? It's from my pantheism. I can't explain it in detail here cuz I'm exhausting myself. I guess psychosis in general made me a pantheist and the psychs just made me realize that. But there's a code on futurama in an episode where they used a similar paradox code where ""God"" (A galaxy) gives an orb of energy or something sent to earth which was a time machine for anyone who says the code out loud.

There's one other person there who has Schizoaffective but he doesn't say much. Sad that I can feel lonely even in a support group.

Anyway, it wasn't working to come down on the meds. It wasn't something that was like a given either. Because I thought it was going to work. Or at least we had to try it before we knew if it was going to work or not. But now I know. Hah"

175979008,"We have a son (my stepson) and my husband has been taking care of him since the age of about 15 or 16. Prior to that for about seven years (note: he was born with developmental delays/issues/), he was severely abused emotionally, physically, and sexually by the mom's boyfriend. He had a nervous breakdown in 2018 and is now on medications that don't really seem to help. He has been diagnosed with SEVERE PTSD, Depression, OCD, and Anxiety disorder that is nothing that anyone has seen nor seems to be able to deal with. He has outbursts every day at least once a day and I don't know how much more I can take. Mentally I am worn out. I know my husband feels defeated daily. We have tried programs so before anyone asks it just gets repetitive. I believe he has brain damage. That is my guess, not a professional. I am not sure if he will ever be ok to navigate this world alone. We need help and there is none. Online support is ideal given the current pandemic crisis. even a support line. Note: his obsessive 
thoughts and inability to really reason with others (at times) can be off-putting and draining. There is no way to summarize this. _EMAIL_"

Also my doctor is very reassuring about the whole coronavirus situation and I feel like I can trust her so that makes me feel less anxious too. I’m really excited about the Xbox One.

175979034,"Hey guys! My name's _NAME_ and I'm from Austria...my current state and the desperation for a normal life have led me to try to reach out for some help, and now I am here! ^^ To myself, I'm a rather casual looking CIS male and never thought much of myself. I never really had a ""normal"" life. Sure, probably more normal than other peoples...but certainly quite off aswell... To my problem... I'm obsessed with my partner... Yes...this may sound ridiculous...usually in relationships there is people that just don't try as hard, and just start slacking...I'm pretty much the opposite. Where others do too little, I do too much. As our relationship went on, I became more and more... obsessed and jealous and...all the toxic stuff, that you don't want to... She knows that...and tells me that it is cute that I want her so badly, and that she wants me just as bad...and there is the breaking point. I just know, she can't... She is always so lovely...but when she's having a bad day or so...she can be quite a drag
on...and that makes me feel worse than others would experience it...When I ask something and she semi-sarcastically answers and I just feel dumb...she makes me feel dumb...or when I ask her how she is doing, and...she doesn't ask back...that just makes me feel like she is not at all interested and doesn't really care? We both agreed on, that friends are something we don't like having, and that we only need each other...but over time she has made so many different friends, and even got in touch and hung out with a former friend of hers, whilst I'm sitting here, not feeling the desire to be with anyone but her. She is my world, she is my everything...every thought is her and she is in everything I do...and not receiving that back..hurts. If something as minor as not being asked how my day was, happens, my whole day is trashed, and I just feel in the mood to just lay around and...start crying? Yeah, it's not good...it's unhealthy...and this issue is about me, and not about her. I take things way too personal...b
ut I feel so pointless, it makes me feel so worthless...I hurt...and constantly think about...just ending my suffering... I have no idea where to go from here. I want to end this relationship, and stay alone for the rest of my life, so I stop putting grief on others, but on the other hand...I NEED her...she gives me reason...she gives me purpose...and I wouldn't know if I could do without her...which is also kind of sick, if you ask me... Is there anything...I can do? I want this to stop...or else by chance things might turn a way I rather not want them to go..."

I have been retreating to my bedroom and bathroom so I can be sad by myself. I have a great support system, but it does not seem to be enough. That is one of the issues, I look at my life and cannot find why I would feel this way. I want to lose myself, I want to get COVID 19 and become a statistic. I want to fall asleep and never wake up.

175979085,Yes. I check mine once a year right now. I just sent my brother in law my labs (he's a doctor). But he isnt my personal doctor.

I honestly didn't care if they were having sex. It's just that they expected a reaction from me so I gave them one because I just woke up. People shouldn't talk to me just as I wake up because I can get really violent. I was hearing voices when I woke up. It's like I'm intoxicated on a psychedelic when I wake up (DMT).

Get a psychologist or therapist to talk thru these feeling. Were u diagnosed with a paranoid or delusional label by health pro? Ca ;t u ask supervisors or collegues if said X contacted them? You may be suffering from delusions or just have fear of succeeding because of your father's influence, and are self sabotaging. I don't know. Just saying what I think not pro, could be wrong. I suggest support group for Adult Children of Abuse. Your fathers treatment is abuse. I think you would benefit by having no contact with your father and talkiing with your sister might clear things up. I'd move away from them all, like I did from my abusive father and family,, best thing I ever did, some of them have reached out after years past, and we can talk now, not about past just check in with each other. You will continue to suffer if u let others conti
nue to control your thoughts. Your father wanting you to be less than him is HIS problem. Not yours, prove him wrong and succeed, love yourself and believe u can become a new and better version of yourself somewhere far away from their influence. Good Luck. And it doesn't hurt to take antipsychotic pills to get rid of the delusions. Could be a nice break to only hear your own voice for once."

175979095,"As for the college part I have some experience but being on the opposing side. I hope that my comment gives you insight and doesn't discourage you more. College is busy, hectic and stressful. Not mention the different mindset you take on when attending college. It can be hard to find time to communicate with people back home, and as they are trying to find their rhythm at college it is even harder to connect with those who do not understand the college grind. Some of them (just a suggestion) may be suffering from depression as well with the new changes and challenges they face. Felling lonely and distraught causing them not reach out more. As for people around you, be yourself and those who like you will continue to be by your side."

They sent me this email with this sad little boy on it and I deleted it. Then I went home and they sent me a picture of the same sad little boy through the mail.

175979120,"This ""isolation"" is no different from what I normally do. (I'm permanently disabled due to mood disorders.) The only exception is I talk to a sibling by email frequently. My elderly mother hasn't called me in about 8 years, quit using her internet so can't talk by email anymore, never sends a letter, forgot to acknowledge my birthday this year for the first time in my life, only my sibling did. When I go to a store the checkout clerks usually say almost nothing to me though they chat with other customers. The most I do is see the p-doctor every month or two. As the years go by I realize more and more I will die exactly like this (and sooner rather than later if the coronavirus causes my death.) I've never gotten a decent suggestion from anyone for something new I could do that I want to do. I don't want to do any of the things ever suggested to me like going to a group therapy meeting, a book club, etc. I'm not compatible with those things and don't want to. The last suggestion I got from my pdoc 
is to attend some ""clubhouse"" program they have there. But they won't tell anything about it (what in the world is it?!?) -- says online they work on living skills and self-esteem and peer support, etc -- I have a college degree, I don't need help with living skills!, and besides you sit around there all day -- I'm not going to do that, I enjoy watching my own TV and movies during the day, and reading!"

I will no longer have him pestering me any longer. *dust shoulder* I'm so relieved that I finally got my haircut. I look completely different! My sister said she'd co-sign for a HOUSE for me. Isn't that crazy? My credit is trash but I have a stable job and a few thousand saved up. I hope I can get an apartment just with a letter and stay stubs. I'd love to have my own place again... That way I can get a cat and not deal with roommates. Eek, this one's been a nightmare."
175979122,I have a feeling I'm going to be below 160lbs within the next week or so. Finally. I haven't been below the 160's since well over a year ago. I was 168 lbs a month or so ago and yesterday I weighed myself and I was 160
175979123,Im saying the person i am right now wouldnt like the 'healthy' version of me
175979124,YES I did!!!! And I finally got to wear my duck boots because it rained today. didn't need to wear them because most of the rain was over with by the time I put them on but that's okay. I'm happy I got to wear them.
175979125,"They tend to feel similar to me, which has led me to wonder now if what I've been conceptualizing as my own fear of engulfment is actually something else. I half-remember an existentialist saying that in all of our interactions with the world we leave behind fragments of ourselves for others, and some naturally fear that by leaving something of themselves behind, they become less. That seems a little closer to my experience of it."

175979128,Nobody has perfect parents just in case you didn’t realize. In addition for those of us with mental illness they’re often carrying half the genes we have so they might display mild paranoia etc. For me I view them as imperfect humans who are trying their best just like I am.

174373673,"I phoned my therapist and left her a message. I'm very unhappy and scared. But at the same time, it's all good. Maybe I'm just freaking out. 1-2 weeks ago, I was on a schizophrenia facebook group and the owner was like ""No one is better than anyone else"" - I wrote a message in psychosis and I got banned without ""without warning"". So I just think about people thinking they are better than others and it spirals down to uniqueness, people defining themselves by not getting better with schizophrenia, the fact that I think I can cure it - Due to my solipsism or optimism, the race thing and _NAME_ followers stating facts and people being held responsible for things that happened before they were born, the left, how it relates to creative genius and no common sense, people talking to me about things I don't agree with yet want to be their friend so I don't defend myself and instead keep the peace - Like how I was with my moms ex bf, her new bf's, the video chat people and my identity, not being able t
o reassure myself, the confusion, the high school conspiracy friend that deleted me for making fun of anti-vaxxers, me not giving a **** about vaccinations, making fun of the virus, swirling around a vortex of news and media and propaganda and wanting to read history books, not being taught science in school but having to learn about religion and irish history - It's all ****_NAME_."
175979132,"I have been going through... a lot lately... All my live I've hidden who I really was from the world. All my parents ever said was : 'Sit still, act normal, adjust, change!' Lately I have had shock upon emotional shock, forcing me to open up more. It helped me grow as a person, but caused a rift between me and my family. Those who matter most to me... Before my sister had children, I didn't care about anything. I was a criminal, I hurt so many people I've lost count. I thought I had left all of that behind, but now... my family is under threat. I can hear the monster growling. I don't want to listen, but its there. I need to get a handle on this before the beast gets loose. I hate it I am afraid of it"

175979140,Funny you asked that because I just took some. I'll see if it helps when it kicks in in 90 minutes - I'll see if phenibut is at least part of the problem. The injection will kick in and olanzepine. I'm not sure which is the problem but I'll see in 90 minutes..

175979145,"Morning was filled with tense anxiety but it subsided by noon. Had a fun day at work with the new guys. We get along very well. I paid my car registration online this year, looks like it will come maybe a week too late but all i can do is all i can do. Much easier than waiting in the DMV anyway, especially since they are closed. Ordered my first pizza in a long time, nobody wore masks there. Strange. Installed a few games on my computer, including Grand Theft Auto 4 and Quake Live. I should get my copy of my book by monday. Really excited about that. It's really original so I'm looking forward to seeing people's reactions to it. Takes on the problem of evil and redemption in a new nuanced way,"

First I want to read _NAME_ - Way of Zen cuz I have it bought already. I've been interested in spiritual type esoteric philosophy and eastern philosophy but not really interested in studying a whole religion. I'm interested in fiction and science fiction more than non-fiction. That's just kind of where my mind goes.
175979147,"a few days ago i got an email saying that i would need to pay to be on here, but today i found i got another email saying that's not true, and i feel really relieved. being on here even though it was for such a little time, made me feel not as alone as before, and i turn to this to share my thoughts and how i feel. it's something about sharing how you feel to someone you literally don't know, but you know they're going through the same, that's just really relaxing. i've been having really rough days and i just don't have anyone to turn to. my best friend is dealing with a lot of shit on her pwn, and there's no way i could pile on my problems on her own. in general, i feel like opening up about your feelings can really ruin you. in the past, i've gotten blamed or silenced for how i felt, and ever since then i've grown to never talk about how i feel, and when in an argument, i get so drained, and just tell the other person what they want to hear. sometimes when i scroll through twitter, i see so many 
countless arguments, and it just gives me so much anxiety, and gets my heart beating so fast, and i don't know why. i, myself, have gotten into an argument very recently about body shaming, and the opposing argument was that people shouldn't complain about their body weight, and that if someone were to be in their eyes, ""fat"" or ""skinny"", then they would shamelessly tell them. as someone who's weight is always being commented on, it triggered me so much and i ended the argument completely. i felt so judged and suffocated. today was just a complete shitshow for me, and i feel so uncomfortable talking to the people i already know, and i try so hard to hide how i feel, because i know that no one actually wants to hear about my triggers and anxiety, so no one notices how badly i'm hurting inside."
175979148,The storms are starting to scare me right now
175979149,Thank you very much for your response. I managed to get in contact with a local coordinator who provided the in person schedule. Again I appreciate your response!!
174373694,"I don't have schizoaffective disorder, I have depression with psychotic features, but I've done this. It was more back when I wasn't medicated and although I was never gone 24 hours, I would easily be gone 6...8...whatever, just walking all over town, miles and miles, or out in the desert away from everybody and everything. I haven't done it since I've been on a more regulated medication routine with therapy mixed in. IDK if it is normal, it seemed normal to me at the time and it helped my thoughts to calm down. Also I was suicidal a lot at the time and that walking seemed to help me be more at peace. I can't say for sure if that is what is going on with your partner. It might be something to bring up to his doctor if you are able to talk to them. I'm sorry you are struggling with the worry and the fear and concern. I certainly never meant to make anyone worry about me. But I'm sure I did. _PERSON_"
175979150,I see my therapist for the first time since March tomorrow
175979151,I feel really really clear minded today - I don't know why. Like it's incredibly clear. I only feel this way sometimes - It definitely has something to do with the morning coffee. I didn't take an olanzepine last night. I might only take it PRN again or lower the dose to 2.5mg (Half).
175979152,"I just read this in a different forum somewhere. Reminded me of my post. Hopefully it helps your mum. ""Generics are cheaper because they aren’t the brand name formula, and many people ARE sensitive to the different “inert ingredients” different manufacturers use. If changes occur with a change in manufacturers of a generic ask the pharmacist to refill with the previous manufacturer, and if switching to a generic from the brand name causes problems ask your doctor to write for the “brand name only”, documenting the problems. Insurance will often approve the brand name for this reason. They just insist that the generic be tried."""
174373695,"I am in that unfortunate 25% of schizophrenics that medication does not work for. At this point, I have tried literally every single antipsychotic in existence, and in a myriad of combinations and dosages ... Yes, clozaril included in the mix. Nothing is any match for my schizophrenia. The ""specify if: with catatonia"" that has been on my chart post DSM-5 that was schizophrenia: catatonic type before, will not bow to anything. Benzodiazepines bounce right off of my schizophrenia specific catatonia, also. Outside of more ECT, because yes I have tried that too also, I have tried literally everything. (Yoga and meditation are indeed generally good practices, however, I recommend them both.) Therapy is not a good idea for me nor is it feasible which is unfortunate, due to my continuous psychosis and also due to my inevitable alarmingly frequent catatonic episodes ... and my overall level of withdrawal from the environment, reality as most people know it ... and from my own self ... Yes, that word ""co
ntinuous"", is also specified. While I am not constantly in crisis, my connection to ""consensus reality"" is at most extremely tenuous at best. Over the past several years I have severely deteriorated. I cannot live by myself. I cannot do most things. I have been rendered non functional in one too many ways. I can barely go outside, I think I have only left this place to be taken to see my psychiatrist in the past four months. I am not religious, and I certainly do not believe in any sort of supernatural forces of good and evil (boy that always got trippy when I believed I was The Devil ... lol). But, when you are the one called the evil monster enough times due to psychotic episodes ... you start to believe it ... and it got to the point that I saw a monster when I looked in the mirror. This is a nightmare, and this is what schizophrenia looks like when it deteriorates ..."

I mean it seems selfish that I need to goto parks and such but it’s part of my basic maintenance of mood. There is definitely powerlessness going on....that’s in general a trigger for my anxiety....like I need something to do to alleviate my pain, it might be sending flowers but she doesn’t want anything, if anything she’s trying to downsize her stuff so if I send flowers it’s for me and not her and that negates the whole thing.

175979177,"I might have OCD or GAD, depending on who you ask. Maybe both. This is my usual pattern: I do something, then later I regret it, then castigate myself for it, and worry intensely about the consequences. (I also tend to ruminate; that is replay the events over and over and over again in my mind) I’ve suffered from this for more than a decade, episodically. But these days, I am going through a particularly bad stretch which has now been going on for about 15 months. Some of the things I worry about are health related. But other stuff too. I’ve tried therapy, with a highly regarded (and very expensive) psychologist, medication, meditation and a couple of other things. Nothing has worked. For now, I am off the medication because it was not helping. I do have Klonopin and Xanax, but I take those only on extremely rare occasion, and then in very small doses, because I do not want to get addicted Exercise provides a short term temporary reprieve. But an hour later, the anxiety is back again. When I am 
hard at work, I also get a reprieve from the anxiety. But that’s not a great solution because I really don’t wanna work 12 hours a day seven days a week! In many ways, I am very fortunate. I have a good job, enough money that I do not have to worry about money, a nice house, a great family, friends, etc. but the intense and almost ever present anxiety that I suffer from makes it hard for me to enjoy my life. And despite trying I’ve not been able to find a solution"
175979178,"Problem solving... Oddly my Dr brought that up. With covid, my son's school recently went 100 percent remote. There are times I feel stressed bc I know there is a way to get him to understand what is being taught, but, since I'm not a teacher, I don't know all those little tricks of the trade. He said, instead of beating myself up or getting stressed, he said to reach out to other parents in the same boat (fyi not as easy as he thinks to find ppl willing to communicate w a stranger from school during a pandemic). He also said, it's ok to not be able to do it and giving up and moving on to something else, was acceptable at this time in my life and health. That will be hard for me to just skip and move on. But, I'll work on retraining my brain. Retraining brain isn't as easy as I had hoped. When someone, does something that bothers me, instead of getting upset or agitated, I've been trying to stop my brain and force it to think of something wonderful about that person and how blessed I am to have the

People are also convinced that I'm this optimistic and great person when I know that I'm not. I even served as the president for a club dedicated to helping others regarding mental health!!! I try my best to help others but I actually need help too. But people don't see that and I can't bring myself to tell them. I tried but it gets messed up every time I explained. I don't get the help that I seek and I end up faking again. 3. Apathy: I can't connect well with others. I act as if I'm this caring best friend (They believe me!) but deep inside I could care less. Whe
n everyone else gets emotional and cries because of one of my friend's problems, I try my best to cry too because I think that's what I should do. But the truth is, I don't really carel. It's scary!!! Why don't I feel sad like them? 4. ""Sadism"" : Maybe this is the reason why I feel apathetic? I like seeing others suffering. I think they look cool when they go insane and are forced to do reckless things....... Joker? Hahhaha idk :( 5. Relationship problems: I'm stuck in a relationship that I don't want anymore. He cheated on me several times but I can't break up with him because of some mistakes... I'm scared he'll post or share those things online. If he does that, my family will abandon me for sure!! 6.""Daydreamer"": I like imagining myself as the main character of something amazing! I dream that I'm this and that. Been doing it since I was a kid! That's why there are times I don't know if what I remember are actually real events or things that I've dreamed about in the past. Maybe this is why I have iden
tity issues? 7. No motivation: I lose my motivation easily. There are days that I suddenly want to start doing a hobby or learning a skill and at first I act really motivated. But after a while I get bored and lose my energy. 8. Lazy: Umm I think this might be a common problem but somehow I feel that my laziness is becoming extreme? I just really lack energy to even do simple things. Everytime I wake up I feel tired and want to sleep again and because of this my attendance in school was really affected. I keep on saying ""I'm tired"" everyday. But I'm not sure why exactly. I'm just tired of everything. 9. Academic problems: I used to be in the top of my class but now I'm at the bottom and my grades are getting worse! And with that, people are getting disappointed in me. Especially my family. They keep on asking me what happened and that this is not me but I just can't keep up with my lessons anymore. I don't want to fail like this too but even if I tried to study like before I just can't ace it anymore!! What 
happened to me? Does this mean as I grow older I'll become more of a failure than I am now? 10. Hope or torture?: I failed a lot of times in my life. But I didn't want to give up. So when people gave me the opportunity to be the president of my school, I decided that I'll use that to grow and to stop all the negativity in my life. But... I failed. Instead of fixing myself, I ended becoming more negative. BUT that was when I had another opportunity to change myself. I passed in a leadership program overseas. But again, I failed. I became a loner in that program and I embarass myself by failing a project. At this point, I was really considering dying. BUT THEN!!! Here comes this guy who motivated me to keep on holding on. But sadly, again.. it failed. This amazing guy who helped me is now breaking me :) Then after that there's also the case with me becoming the president for the mental health related club - did that help me at all? NOPE!!!! I failed again.Why is this happening? Every time I thought there's stil
l hope for me, I end up getting worse? That's why when I saw _PERSON_ song ""Rolling girl"", maybe like her.. death is really the only salvation for me? I tried to change but now I'm just tired. But still some part of me is still hoping lol maybe I'm also masochistic? HAHAHAHAHA Anyways, I tried to summarize everything as much as possible so I wasn't really able to give details but I think I was able to say what I wanted. Honestly, I don't know why I'm saying these things now. I mean, people are experiencing worse things because of the virus but here I am whining about myself. I'm really a pathetic mess. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But if you got any ideas on what I can do, please please please tell me :("

175979202,Eh haven't posted in this thread for a while. Listening to music. Drinking coffee this morning. Taking my meds. Doing my meditations for anxiety and regular meditation. Deep breathing. Checking in with myself during the day for anxiety symptoms.

175979204,"I've been there and done that.Initially, you will be able to get alot of things done, but sooner or later you will become ragingly psychotic eventually, well, in my case this is what happens. Mania with psychosis is my downfall from not taking my medication. It made me homeless, made me hospitalized, made me disabled, made me unable to take care of myself, and made me hopeless. Please ask your doctor to adjust your medication if you are taking them. If you are not taking them, please take them. I become psychotic then lose my good judgment and forget to take my medication. I hope that you don't fall into the situations I've been. I wish you the best. Sleep is necessary for one's functioning and good health. I realize this after having been manic/ psychotic. My brain becomes fried after mania/ psychosis and the recovery time becomes longer after each episode. This last time it took me two years. Please seek help immediately and take your meds. The best solution may be to get a shot of an antipsychot
ic medication to calm you down immediately and help you sleep. Please ask your psydoc!!"
175979205,"I did well today. I edited my story for 6 hours! I made some great edits that I have missed before. I'm not sure whether I like writing narrative or editing, but I do appreciate my story as I read it in 5 spurts every day. I did a lot of organizing, and rewording, even restructuring. I think my greatest flaw as a writer is finding difficulty in active writing instead of passive writing sentencing structure. I looked it up online and I would need to think differently to be able to do it naturally. The greatest flaw is using ""was"" in certain ways. I'm just going to have _PERSON_ with _PERSON_ today. My check should be coming in the mail by the end of this week I believe. I'm no longer going to use negative and positive anymore. I think that was long enough to change my thinking pattern."

175979208,Yeah since my mom is trying to lose weight we’re just eating healthier in general. Got a lot of vegetables from the store the other day. So it’s going to be good. I’ll be good. Eat healthy and don’t feel guilty about eating. I can do it.
175979209,"Hi _PERSON_, This is a brave post, and I love your dedication to your marriage. There is a lot to be said for that I have known my husband for 12 years, married for 6, and doting mother for 5. It’s been wonderful, but we can be haunted by my mood swings and internal battles with depression. Recently diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, I have been a challenge (to say the least) and am guilty of running away from my husband, hurting with words, paranoid, low lows, and high highs. I once made a budget for an entire two year period... and thought I could write a novel at the same time (I don’t write lol). Now that I am well medicated, and working through nutritional improvement, activity improvement, and step by step therapy I feel like my eyes are just starting to peel over the fishbowl and see the world. This took work, dedication.., and personal accountability; despite the overwhelming guilt. As my husband and I work through this, one strong peace of advice comes to mind. You are a caregiver, and 
you can’t forget about you. You can’t fight the hidden world of somebody’s mind, and you can’t do it alone. And, to a certain extent, neither can your wife. Burnout on both ends can be catastrophic in both worlds. Often times my husband used to try and pacify me, or just fix it, and when I was in a state of mania... there was no coming back. My reason was gone, sanity was gone, and my kindness was gone. And it was never his fault (no matter how much my I told him it was). So I guess what I’m trying to say, is a healthy caregiver is a good caregiver don’t forget about your own mental health, and reach out to services to try and understand not only what your wife is feeling, but what you’re feeling. I know that sounds like a tall order, but it’s worth it to make sure everyone is ok Bi-polar can be incredibly unpredictable, and in that world help and healing is a strenuous and daunting process. Some of the musts got us: Complete transparency with each other and doctors (they’ve heard it all) Nu
trition changes- we eat 90% plants ( my husband says if you want to feel like sunshine you have to eat sunshine haha) Well balanced meds Working out Hygiene lists and daily task lists ( I need reminders for everything) so, even when I’m down I know I need to brush my teeth Talk therapy And most importantly- sleep. The manic get worse with no sleep For what it’s worth... I used to run because I was terrified of being alone. Strange lol."

Not the actual music making but the promotion details and heart break that come with it. My voices are bad. They normally hum melodies and I don't notice them too much. But now because I am so stressed out, they are saying nonsense words to me. Over and over. Very loud too. I can never work again. I can't deal with the pressure. And I'm very depressed.

175979220,snoopy is right on about klonipin vs Xanax. klon has a much longer half life and therefore less chance of addiction. klonopin withdrawl is hell but vomiting is not one of its symptoms. addiction to benzos is not a light matter and I urge everyone to find an alternative med to a benzo. use them sparingly and for emergency use . you will be suprized how effective some herbal formulas are but it takes research and trial an error to find what works . when I was looking for an alternative to klonopin I did loads for research and found some one who had tried all the strongest natural herbal remedies. at the top was kava and chamomile. I already knew about kava but its controversial about long term use . I found a store that had chamomile capsules and darn if it didn't work. and well!
175979221,Sorry to hear that going through the same thing
175979222,Have a good weekend everybody!
175979223,Oh and also I read something on mental health that said to look your best every day. Which means like to look good even when you're wandering around the house aimlessly. I don't know if it means that necessarily. I think it just means that I should be dressing how I please. For me that means wearing a sportcoat sometimes. But I think people around me think that's stupid. I don't know... I am not giving up on the sportcoat though.
175979224,Oh that sucks......

I will wish that for the rest of my life. just don’t let it become what you wait for forever because it most likely will only end up hurting you and slowly killing you. Let go this year and be. Do you and enjoy every moment of it. I k ow exactly how you feel and in 2020 I decided to let go of those people. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I know it. Look forward and hope for better that yesterday. It’s all we really can do. One foot in front of the other. Wishing you love peace and happiness this new year. ?

I met someone on the trip chat and he has schizophrenia and is really struggling. Has no family or friends just pets and a girlfriend. He had schizophrenia at 13 and started drugs at 15 and now he can't stop. I'm on the other side and trying to be sober. There's many people on that website that take drugs and have schizophrenia.

175979240,"I'm having a difficult time recently with smelling cigarette smoke-it's been daily for the last week. This has happened to me before and it's gone away... and come back and gone away over the last few years. I can go months to a year without experiencing this, but when it comes, it's maddening and extremely uncomfortable. I also just so happen to HATE the smell of cigarettes. Back when I first began having severe anxiety and experiencing derealization, 7 yrs ago, I noticed that my anxiety/DR often came about when I smelled actual cigarettes. Now, smelling actual cigarettes doesn't always trigger me, but having this phantom smell sure does worry the heck out of me. It's hard not to Google it. Even though, for the most part, things I find about it talk about it not being uncommon and that it most often has to do with a sinus issue - which I have a deviated septum and allergies, and have gone through periods of sinus issues on and off since I was a pre-teen. Anyone else ever deal with phantom smells??

I was so messed up after talking to him we just walked right out and went home pussled. My Mom is one of my main support people for my mental illnesses. Without her I would be a mess. My mental illnesses are not from my childhood at all. My Mom raised me good and did everything to make me a great kid. Just bcuz my parents got a divorce when I was 15 dosen't mean I am a mess from it or ever was. I delt with it as best I could and after I understood both sides of the story I was fine. I had a great childhood awesome parents and grandparents on both sides I was a good teen I had a great time in high school. I had all the friends you could imagine a great job while in high school that I started when I was 15 so I had everything anyone could want. All my mental illnesses especially depression came after all this. There is no way this Psychiatrist should have spoke about my Mom the way he did and 
he was so abrasive I couldn't even talk to stop him from going off about it all. So I sat and waited until he was done then left.

174373883,"I was a crazy autistic when I was a kid. Or I was just being a kid although no one could control me and I was lost in my own mind really hyper. Very popular because I was funny. Could be just ADHD but then I got negative symptoms of schizophrenia, calmed down and isolated myself and then I got psychosis and wasn't calm again. Now I'm on meds and I'm calm again and I'm social normally. ""Autism was initially believed to be a childhood form of schizophrenia, which would emerge as full-blown schizophrenia in young adulthood"" which is now believed to be wrong but I think I have PDD-NOS (Pervasive developmental disorder - Not otherwise specified) and schizophrenia so maybe the psychosis lit up the creative side of my brain rather than the analytical because I was really really good at math.. Now I'm calm and have ADD instead of ADHD and my OCD was cured by high dose of psychedelics. I'm was a mental mess until now.. But no signs of bipolar other than severe depression which is half of it I guess.. I wo
uld think of myself as a kid as manic."

I'll study psychology too so I can then participate and train the psychedelic therapists, study neuroscience and chemistry. I also want to study sociology to understand the brainwashing of society and free people, be motivating and help people that were like me. Or no? Idk.."

175979297,"I've just admitted the possibility that I may have had/still sometimes have psychotic symptoms caused by trauma. It's very difficult to process the fact that I am more mentally ill than I thought. Yes I knew I had CPTSD, but realising I may be sometimes psychotic is something very different. How did you process it? How do you learn to live with that realisation?"
175979298,"It depends on my mood. Most of the time, I feel nothing. Other times, I feel paranoia, but it's not necessarily directed at a specific individual. It's more often directed at my perception of my own vulnerability. On occasion, I will also feel extremely nervous, irritated, or otherwise uncomfortable when interacting with another person, but it's never directed at the person. Instead, I just feel that way about the fact that I am interacting at the moment and begin to withdraw or become noticeably distracted."

175979303,"It’s good that you know where this anxiety and depression comes from, that it runs in your family. You said medicine is looked down on in your family. You said you’ve taken medication before after a bad breakup. You said, “I feel like I have cortisol pumping through me all the time so maybe thats why I have impulsive and angry comments too.” Mayoclinic.org says about cortisol: ""When you encounter a perceived threat — such as a large dog barking at you during your morning walk — your hypothalamus, a tiny region at your brain's base, sets off an alarm system in your body. Through a combination of nerve and hormonal signals, this system prompts your adrenal glands, located atop your kidneys, to release a surge of hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol.” • It says this can cause: Anxiety, Depression, Digestive problems, Headaches, Heart disease, Sleep problems, Weight gain, Memory and concentration impairment. Do you have that? If you don’t want to take medicine, you could look 
at the “”resources” near the top of this anxiety forum. Or you can combine the two. Are you still getting out for any walks?"

So I'm also looking for support and groups and advice on anything that would help me with my problems and will help that someone will recommend. I believe you have come a long way and you have obviously done what you have and things have gotten at least somewhat better so if I could give you advice I would tell you to use your coping skills that has helped you and use them in your life today. I bet it would help because you are very informative and know your issues and have learned so much on your history. I have a doctor and not once has he ever told me that I can do all these groups and etc and I believe that it will truly benefit me.

175979308,"My mental health and my actions are causing irreparable damage in my marriage. I lie and do things my husband doesn’t like or want because I’m afraid of his reaction and it’s easier than to deal with my issues or communicate with him. It’s easier to avoid. I went to therapy last year to be a better wife, mother, and me. But I mostly talked about how my husband’s mental health issues affect me instead. This caused me to be more vocal and defiant and he still brings it up in arguments today. He lives his life believing I don’t love and respect him because why would I treat him this way if I did? Why do I do these things? Sometimes I am resentful and it is more important to consider my feelings. I become very selfish. Issues that I have caused 6 years ago still resurface today and I don’t know why I can’t break the pattern. He just caught me in a very big lie that has affected our relationship since the beginning and he doesn’t know if he could ever trust me again. Why didn’t I tel
l him the truth 6 years ago? Because I was afraid. I make mistakes and feel bad but can’t offer him a reasonable explanation why I keep doing them. He usually gets angry and and says awfully mean things and I sink into a deep hole. Maybe as a defense mechanism I avoid my problems and him. I have asked to go to couples therapy but he won’t because he doesn’t believe he has anything to contribute to therapy. Now he doesn’t know if he can get over this and ever trust me again. He believes our whole relationship is a lie and I don’t blame him for feeling this way."

175979327,"Hello HealingWell-ers. I realise that this is an old thread but I thought I'd share my experience with the same visual issue that's discussed here. I first began to notice some odd trails as I walked past objects in my peripheral vision. I first noticed this about 10 years ago - I was walking to work and as I walked past lamposts or trees I could tell there was some kind of ghosting going on. As it was only in my peripheral I knew it was there but couldn't look directly at it. Soon I also noticed it (as mentioned by someone else in this thread) that it sometimes happened when I walked into a room, as I went through the door frame. I also have the exact same visual issue that has been described in this thread as a milky shadow playing catchup. In the right conditions (for some reason dim light and after waking up) I can move my hand Infront of my face and clearly see a trail of some kind. It is not a motion blur as it is still present no matter how slowly (or fast) I move my hand. Sometimes, as also 
mentioned in this thread, I will catch it happening if I go to pick something up with my arm. My history is that I suffer from anxiety and depression. I take anti-deppresants. I have not taken illegal drugs since I was 17 but experimented with LSD twice (I am currently 42). It doesn't seem to be drug related as most people here have never taken drugs. Last summer I had a Stroke but I know this is not related as I noticed the visual issues many years prior to that happening - I am due to have a hole in my heart closed in the next few months (apparently this was likely the cause of the Stroke). I have astigmatism and wear glasses to correct it. 99% of the time I have no issues with my vision but every so often these symptoms seem to show their ugly face. Keep well."

Had my appointment today with the therapist. She read through my CBT-i sleep logs and was quick to point out that I'm having a very difficult time. She must be brilliant. All she did was then give me a couple of handouts regarding calming / relaxing the mind and ways to distract the mind with useless tasks, like counting ceiling tiles and the like. I brought notes that she was going to pass along to my PCM: (1) I've requested that we try Remeron as a sleep aid versus the Trazodone. (2) I've requested that we look at alternatives to Bupropion. I've read that if one has anxiety / stress issues, then Bupropion is not really a good antidepressant to prescribe. (3) I've requested a blood test to look at my thyroid levels (T3, T4, TSM). I want to rule out a physical cause of my insomnia, if possible. So now I'm waiting to hear 
back from my PCM. In the meantime, I am continuing on with my current medication routine and schedule: - 100mg of trazodone at 10:00 p.m. - A dropper full of CBD tincture under the tongue at 10:30 p.m. - Bedtime at 11:00 p.m., 5mg of melatonin at bedtime. - Out of bed at 6:00 a.m. _NAME_ - Colorado Springs"
175979348,"MV., Vistaril/hydroxyzine (prescript ion antihistamine taken off label for anxiety) can be a great alternative to a benzodiazepine. It is taken PRN for times of acute anxiety/panic just like a benzo, but does not carry the risk of dependency. The downside is that the efficacy may not quite match that of a benzodiazepine, and some have reported that the sedation effect was too strong for functioning well during the day... ...but everyone has a different experience and needs, so I absolutely think it is worth trying! It could be just what you need for your management regimen! Let us know what you decide and how it goes if you do give this Rx a try! S.C."

175979359,"No it's ok I'm pissed at my mom for being so drunk last night. She drinks every single night. But it was her birthday so I'll let it pass. I dont have a nurse personality so I'm absolutely useless at taking care of people. I was worried about her heart going into arrhythmias and she was wasted and delusional. It was like taking care of someone that is psychotic in real life but I felt like she was doing it on purpose for some reason thinking it was funny. She tried to eat her soup with a fork and wouldn't let me help her like to even give her a spoon. She spilled the soup all over her bed. Every time we went to sleep, she'd get up and say ""location"" or something. I was so pissed off. Why? Because I said to her while she was pouring a glass of wine, ""Dont get so drunk that you wont be ok and I'll worry and have to take care of you"" and she said ""I might do it anyways"". That really pissed me off. But shes dealing with a lot of **** and her cancer. Her car got tode last night She had her ex bf i
n bed with her and I was complaining that she was giving him mixed feelings saying to leave and then stay then leave like she was borderline or something. I was soooo mad. I went psychotic for an hour because she kept saying ""Am I a good mother?"" And I said yes but honestly I dont know. She shouldn't have cheated on my dad in the way she did and said ""I have feelings for *ex steo dad*"" like every other guy and continues to neglect her children for being drunk and reckless then having anxiety, walking all over me, never letting me have a say in anything. Although I did make her care for me when I was doing so much drugs (because of my step dad and her neglect - always being at my step dads house while I was full blown psychotic thinking they were going to kill me, running in the freezing cold, knocking on their door and running back so I swallowed a bunch of klonopin) so I feel like I deserve it. Is it possible to be psychotic for a moment when triggered by intense emotion? I was thinking that people creat
ed this reality to torture me and that nothing is real and when my mom says she loves me that it isnt real and shes actually a simulation cyborg. Screwed up stuff.. That's why I'm so pissed off about what the person and the soldiers said to me in the video chats. It still really gets to me because no one tells the truth to me like that in real life and lies."

175979369,"What you grapple with regularly sounds much more challenging than anything I have had to tame within myself. That said, here are some things which have worked and are working for me: Lately, I've been doing the _PERSON_ meditation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxgD9En6Vso I have followed the above practice for 17 days expecting nothing , simply 'showing up'. However, for the past few days, my productivity has increased appreciably. This is saying a lot, as I am normally a pitifully disorganized procrastinator who keeps erratic hours. This is by no means my first attempt at meditation--I have repeatedly failed in the past because the challenge of keeping my mind still put me off. The fact that the _PERSON_ video is set to a voice helps immensely . I'm using it to get in the habit of stilling my mind twice a day. After many months, I plan to wean myself from the video and revisit the meditation practices which I found too hard years ago. Personally, I believe that all contemporary famous guru
s, especially since the 1960s, are charlatans and manipulators cashing in on a venerable tradition. To me, _PERSON_ is a pleasant-looking man with an agreeable speaking voice--nothing more. However, the twice daily habit of sitting cross-legged, spine erect , breathing deeply, accompanied by the voice in the video, and largely unencumbered by thoughts, is something I look forward to which calms my mind. Behaving well with the body has frequently helped me to bring my mind under control. You might find _PERSON_ meditation beneficial too. The Power of Now , by _PERSON_ ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Now ), also helped me immensely. It's pleasurable to read, accessible without being dumbed-down in any way, and presumes zero knowledge of spiritual practices. I bought a used copy from Amazon.com for under $10. Although I normally have a hard time concentrating long enough to make adequate progress reading, I managed to finish the entire book and found every morsel worthwhile. If you have a library ca
rd, your local public library almost certainly owns it. Many times, experienced meditation practitioners have advised against ""ignoring"" intrusive thoughts. Instead, they have advised passively ""watching"" such thoughts--neither ignoring nor engaging with them--just watching them appear, pass by, and vanish . Getting in the habit of simply quietly watching them. I believe that the ultimate function of this is to wean us of the deeply-entrenched habit of identifying with our thoughts . Illusory thoughts."

I started watching videos on youtube to learn how. I even watched videos made for children. It felt strange at 1st but now I enjoy it. They diagnosed me with ADD anxiety depression(20 years ago). Changing my diet, taking specific natural supplements, stopping the ton of prescript ion drugs and learning these meditation techniques, changed my life. I began everything slowly. Changes were incremental but consistent improvement. Mild, occasional anxiety is the only issue I have left. Ashwaganda helps. It isn't always easy to live such a disciplined life but the results are worth it."

175979392,"My father was an English teacher for high school students. He is retired now, and attempting to write a book. He has written many poems and essays, and even gave us (my three sibs and I) copies. He just gave me copies of his latest work. In it he reflects on his life and his four children. When I read the paragraph on me... I was heartbroken. I do my best to say ""I have bipolar disorder"", not ""I am bipolar"". My medical condition does not define who I am. I have had many medical conditions throughout my life (starting at the age of 2 days), and still do. But, that is not who I am, it is what has happened to me. The paragraphs on my siblings are about being loving, driven, caring, outgoing, etc... The first nine of twelve lines in my paragraph talks about all my medical problems. Even the sentence about my daughter mentions I went through IVF to get her. Is this the way people see me? I am a medical anomaly walking around? I have had three major medical conditions all my life. Two of which are ch
ronic. But, I have had years when I am doing well. Even when I am dealing with my medical problems, it is just a part of my day, it is not my day. I am not bi-polar, I have bi-polar. I am not gastroparesis, I have gastroparesis. However, I AM a mom, a sister, a wife, a daughter, an exchange student, a college graduate, a boss, an employee.... that is what I AM. I called my dad after reading his essay. He felt terrible about it. He was just trying to show how resilient I am through all my issues. How I do not let it get in my way of my life. He did not mean to make it the focus of the paragraph. He is going to rewrite it. I am sad that I made my Dad feel bad. It was neither of our intentions. He thanked me for talking to him about it. He sees how the way he wrote it does make it seem like my medical issues are who I am. It does not help that I am having symptoms of both my chronic medical conditions right now. Stress makes them worse, and I am very stressed right now. COVID-19 is disrupting my life quite a bit
, and my daughter (who is an only child) is confused, because mommy is home, but cannot play (I am working from home and expected to work from 8a-4p). She misses her friends and cousins. Face chat is fun, but it still is not playing with someone. The weather is going to be awful the next couple of days, so going outside on a dog walk or riding bikes will not be possible. I am seeing a therapist and my shrink regularly. I am eating healthy, getting exercise and taking my meds. I practice my coping mechanisms. I do what I am told to do when I am struggling... but it seems fruitless. When you add having symptoms plus being shown that your medical issues are what defines you to other people, it is hard to want to go on. My ""baseline"" is thinking about suicide and researching it a lot. I look for new ways to die that might be considered an accident, not suicide.... that is normal behavior for me. But right now, I am not researching. I am not planning my funeral (yet another baseline for me). I am just wishing I 
could sleep forever. I could just get ""out""... what ""out"" looks like, I do not know. These thoughts and feelings are known to my care team and family (which IS odd for me because I normally hide it). Thanks for reading my rant. Stay safe and healthy."

175979407,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar I two years ago. Was hospitalized numerous times, once for 36 days. I can trace my symptoms back to when I was a teenager and it took till my 30s to be properly diagnosed and treated. But I’m still not where I want to be, and I don’t know if things will still get better, what my ‘normal’ is or if another dreaded relapse is just around the corner. My symptoms leading up to this are all textbook...and I was treated for years with heavy duty antidepressants before those medications finally contributed to my severe and uncontrollable manic episode, thus requiring hospitalization and med changes due to my diagnosis. My symptoms of mania were also classic - spending sprees, erratic speech, not sleeping or eating for days, 1000 amazing ideas I wanted to do but never finished one, thinking I was psychic and wanting to be a famous singer. I had people who I thought were friends take advantage of me and steal from me, even when they could recognize I was sick. And I was a
lso highly irritable and took it out, over the years, on almost everyone that is close to me, and I hurt so many people. The worst part is having the judgement from those who don’t understand and the guilt about things you’ve done and said when a lot of them you don’t even remember because you were so sick. And trying to repair the damage done from an illness that created a monster... The knowing that this is a life sentence that requires lifelong medications that you hope and pray will keep you stable, and feeling that you don’t even really know who you actually are anymore, because you’ve been plagued for so long... I want to believe in happy endings and choose to fight. I want to spread the word to end the stigmas and educate those who haven’t a clue. I want to help others as others have helped me and make a difference. I want to thrive and to survive. And I hope anyone else struggling or dealing with someone struggling can try to be gentle and compassionate with themselves and others because t
his illness is not a choice. You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice to survive."

His shrink has been urging him to leave me for 19 years. He recommended metformin for me and told my friend that it's very hard to lose weight from exercising. So.. So, for my own better flexibility I want to lose weight. It will have the added bonus of my friend stopping talking about my weight everywhere he goes.

I have been open and honest with my care team and husband (this is actually new for me, I am usually very private about it until I am over the edge). But, I see myself slippping just a bit each day.

My family has taken to going for walks at a local (closed right now) camp ground. There are not people there and my daughter can ride her bike on the road without worry of any cars. The fresh air and getting out of the house does me a world of good. But, in the last two days, even that is getting harder to do. I just want to sleep. I want to sleep and wake up years from now when life is good. Will it be good years from now though? I sometimes wonder. I have no plans or any intention to act on anything. But, I have t

175979446,"I did have that general recurring feeling for about half a year, ""coincidentally"" starting right after the last presidential elections here. I think it's very much a normal reaction to a highly abnormal state of affairs, and it doesn't have much to do with what mental conditions you do or don't have. It went away with time and active distractions. It's essentially a mourning process. Okay let's go over those other bullet points one by one then: That's an obsessive thought pattern. Obsessiveness may or may not be present, but it's not part of the usual descriptions or definitions of SPD in any way, it's just something else. It is part of StPD, and the distinction between SPD and StPD is arguably arbitrary, but even when it comes to StPD, there's a subtle but significant difference: the person's level of enjoyment and engagement is lacking regardless of whether they've been obsessive lately. If anything, that ""search for a bigger meaning"" happens because of that persistent lack of enjoyment rathe
r than the other way around. This is a dogmatic way of thinking. Again not particularly related or unrelated to SPD, I think (more common and specific to the slightly more distant cluster-A relative, PPD). The ""futility"" part kinda touches on it, but it has a strong and specific connotation that won't necessarily be there in reality. ""Changes in anything are moot"" would be a more characteristic belief. This specifically implies a changing state. ""Becoming"" disconnected and isolated rather than ""being"" disconnected and isolated. Again subtle but significant. Kinda sounds like a rephrasing of the previous point, except for the ""completely different level"" thing. That feeling may be common in SPD (don't know if it is), but it's not specific to it and it's not integral to it. ""Just something else"", like the obsessiveness from the first point. Again the ""being"" versus ""becoming"". If you have low motivation to do things you normally do, that means that having motivation to do those things is (or was
, until recently) ""your normal"". It specifically implies a break from a ""normal"" baseline. Good-old existential crisis. I don't get why you connect this one to SPD. Suicidality is unsurprisingly associated with mental disorders in general and with anything that alienates you from society no matter the cause, but I don't see any particular link to SPD (unlike, say, BPD). The main thread connecting all these points is the ""becoming rather than being"". It's not trying to describe what someone may be like, it's trying to describe what someone may be going through. Well the Dalai Lama is a public figure. You don't see monks giving talks and interviews, and you don't see the Dalai Lama doing anything other than that. Not really a fair comparison. Neither is representative of ""Buddhists"" in general anyway."

I have co-workers, but since I am the boss, it is inappropriate for me to have an outside-friendly relationship with them. So, I understand. It is hard to make friends as an adult. My sister has good luck finding friends at her work, but then she is not the boss there."

175979466,"It’s been there before I’m taking Zoloft, the doctor said it’s from the anxiety and stress but supposed to be the Zoloft will help out my anxiety. I’m always out of breath. I wonder if I could ask for an X-ray. I’m really worried about it. My husband said it could be a muscle spasm. But it’s been like 3-4months of agony. I don’t want to end up like my brother with the mass on his brain. He passed away with that. And I don’t want also to have a clot clogging or something about blood. I know that when you are stress your blood pressure went high. I will talk to him about my blood pressure too. I’m just worried freak about my health especially I have a son to take care of. I’m sorry guys, I just need to vent out my worries. I change my time taking the Zoloft btw, I took it last night at 9pm now."

175979497,My moms friend with bipolar said that she had 150 dollars and God said she needed 200 dollars to win in gambling so I gave her 25 dollars and said not to go cuz what if she loses? She'll feel even worse cuz she's just trying to make herself feel better. She said I was giving her bad vibes but I said that it's cuz I care and that I have the Gods telling me to do things too and know what it's like and people care about me which is why I'm stable..
175979498,"I read most of the comments here and i thought of a better idea that i know would suit me and possibly more people here better- Some kind of an open online skype room where you meet the same people, if you feel like it you talk once in a while, i guess it would be silent most of the time. I thought of it because as i know myself i cant fill the silence with voice without forcing it, so that idea to meet makes me feel something is supposed to happen but it doesnt, so a skype room where you can just not speak (with the same people, maybe 10-15 people) would be less challenging, more natural, you can keep mic off most of the day Most of all there isnt this unwanted commitment for something you dont enjoy doing, but have to do for your mental health"
175979499,"Texting is super hard, I agree. Yeah maybe if you feel up to it, calling her might be better. Also, sometimes for me, focusing too much on how I am feeling can make my mood get even worse. So I find something to distract myself and laugh or do something completely different. I find that helps most of the time. I do understand though, that sometimes the feelings can be overwhelming."

You can write down the ones who work in the category you are interested in: wrongful death, might be a guess, or ""cause of death"" or something. After getting a list of 4 or 5 attorneys, and writing down their address, phone number and email address, you can pick the top one you want and contact that person. You can choose a male or female attorney. They will surely have an email address, and ask them if they handle your type of legal concern. If they do, maybe tell them the problem you are having with phone calls, and can you tell them the problem by email. With cell phones, can you call them after 5 p.m. closing time?

175979530,"No. Guess I'll die and you'll live A lot of scientists have said a lot of things, for example, that the fat content of food, and not high fructose corn syrup, was responsible for obesity. Many of the things scientists say are subsequently debunked. Unfortunately, unless one knows for oneself (i.e. are you one of those scientists?) the details of a specific issue, it's almost impossible to distinguish truth from what is nothing more than paid advertising. One thing I do, however, know, is that to be a ""scientist"" nowadays typically requires a great deal of funding. And that funding comes from somewhere, typically from someone with a vested interest in the lab results. It is not unheard-of where scientists who did not deliver their sponsors' desired results not only lost their funding but had their careers ruined."

I cstill feel anxiety, but the biggest thing I miss is that connection with music I once had, or that passion forcing me to express myself in writing. I no longer feel wonder as an emotion."
175979534,"Additionally, there is a point I must disagree with Speedwalker on and that is you or anyone being ""past the point of self help"" which could too easily be misinterpreted as "" beyond any help"" or just operating from a viewpoint looking backwards rather than forward. Personally, I think operating from a platform in the positive and proactive is better than doing nothing or operating solely from the negative. This is why I made the entire beginning of my initial reply about how you, _PERSON_, are beginning to take responsibility for yourself by posting, explaining, and reaching out. That's you doing for you in crisis mode. The greater point I try to continue explaining is that it's not just about crisis mode and seeing a doctor or getting on a medication is not a free pass to complain about your state of being without continuing to act upon it for yourself in general. Too many people fall into this way of thinking which does not serve one's best interests. They see a therapist or several and/or go 
from med to med throwing their hands up and pining over why nothing seems to be working without putting the REAL work in to discipline the mind and body to relax and work together. Make no mistake that it is not always made easier by therapists or meds, it all requires WORK you must do for yourself as well. Otherwise you're just throwing money out the window, wasting away, and expecting wine from water out of meds and therapy if you'll pardon the metaphor. ~ cres"

I noticed that my cat doesn't know what to do all the time but want my attention. She's very needy.. Then she sleeps, eats, drinks, scratches the carpet.. All these little things that I do are important. I shouldn't focus so much on what other people think and just live in the moment.. But people make it hard. Cuz my mom was just trying to live in the moment by going for a walk with her friend that got back from Mexico but we were staying 6ft away from each other and we were that caring for each other that we would at least stay that far away the whole time.. But someone drove past us and waved and smiled (She hates them) and started telling everyone that we weren't supposed to be doing that.. So now my mom is arguing with people on social media about the whole thing and becoming stressed. She said she was going to go to sleep 2 hours ago and 
she works in the morning.. I told her to just look at videos of animals before she goes to sleep.. She won't listen.. When my mom was in the compassion house for breast cancer, she was talking about how if she won the lottery, she would move to Australia and take care of the koalas that were being burned in the fires...

He's the one that gave me the ""An unquiet mind"" book and a few other books. He reads a lot. He says he's straight so I shouldn't be worried about another old man doing this to me - Possible trigger: Last one was bisexual and masturbated to my voice on the phone on christmas while crying because an 18 year old or someone that he lived with committed suicide on christmas day. He wanted t
o book a hotel with me and then I hung up the phone horrified. The friend I'm talking to now says I look good but he didn't compliment my eyes and **** like the other old man. I'm just paranoid so.."

174374344,"When I went on Clozaril back in 2011, I took one and a half pills in the morning and one and a half pills just before bedtime. But it was making me sleepy during the day too much. So my doctor at the time told me to take just one pill in the morning and two pills at night instead. It worked. Ever since making that change my Clozaril no longer makes me tired during the day."

He said to come at 6:30 PM. He is going into private practice, cash only at the end of the year. I want to find out how much his cash price will be. He's moving his practice to Palm Springs too which is quite a long way but I don't care about that. I just need to know if I need to find a new pdoc or if I can afford his fee. I'm hoping it will only be like $150. Because then I could do it for sure."
175979592,"There is life in me. But these days the calmness and boring mundane life stretches out for weeks or months at a time. I barely get any ecstatic glimmer that I often crave and I only occasionally feel it by holding onto my good memories. I need hope. I forget what I'm really here for. It's not that I don't have direction - It's just that I can articulate what I want because it's in a way, non-physical but not completely just that. Something unique - And I know that it is shielded from any criticisms that people can use from it to bring me down - Cuz it's my true being. I like to be mysterious as well - So all of these things are in any person.. But most people I think have a learned helplessness and put others down. I will need glass vials for my LSD and MDMA rocks - No jk... I went on a 5km walk with my mom and a couple other people for cancer awareness - It was good. Nice weather and good exercise. My sister and her bf drove me home. My sister told me what I did today and I said that I was writing 
things down but didn't do much - Just revised the crypto and used some to buy more phenibut because I use it to tolerate my mom and her friends on the hikes. I said that I was taking shots of rum yesterday and got a hangover in the evening. My sister got the vaccine and said that she can drive me to the city later so I can get mine. My sister knows that I microdose mushes. I wish I could be more open about things like this to my family or regular people - But anyways.. What I want to do is read more books and gain knowledge. When people strike up a conversation with me, it seems like the only time that I have something to say is when I'm having disorganized thinking. It's like a curse that when I'm clear minded and organized, I have nothing to say.. But when I'm disorganized and foggy headed, I just never stop talking. I listen to music and talk to people online and I do that a lot - It's hard to focus without music. My brain is musical and likes rhythm - lalala, lalala, lalala - THAT... And in depersonalizat
ion, there's always a song stuck in my head. I don't get dissociation anymore which is why I'm starting to feel better. I accept that there's a duality of physics/_NAME_-physics and I have to dance along to it instead of fighting the uncertainty between the two. I accept that reality is an illusion - Which I realize that most people already know. So I am but a new soul, walking through the flashing lights and surprises."

Perhaps this isn't the right forum if they are hypnagogic hallucinations however since I have prior experience of psychosis maybe it is, idk. But, anyway, woke up to voices once, and I don't know if this is psychosis or hypnagogic hallucinations, or both, or whatever. I don't have much knowledge of hypnagogic hallucinations and hoping someone may be able to tell me more... I did not use substances the day of the auditory hallucination and went to sleep earlier than I usually do. The date of the supposed auditory hallucination/hypnagogic was about a month ago, hasn't happened since. Obviously, none of you were with me when this happened, so you can't tell me whether it was hypnagogic or psychosis (whether they're the same thing or different, I don't know much about) but maybe hoping someone can provide me insight. Thanks."

I already dropped the course and have signed up at asu again. I know everyone is tired of me doing this. I know. I am too. _PERSON_ wants me to take earned admission courses too but because I dropped out of some things I did with them before. Good thing is like before, I don’t have to pay to take them unless I pass. If I don’t, I don’t have to pay and can retake them as many times as I want. Cheaper education too. Has my exact major I want. But the quality? I’m not so sure of. I think it’s quality but it’s definitely not HES quality. But, idk...it’s cheaper, has my exact major, etc idk... It’s fully online. I just idk what to do anymore, I don’t."
175979602,Hugs could it be because you’re losing unemployment?

175979605,"This is the odd bit: she's very hung up on how people perceive her. She drives an expensive car with personalised plates, spends £200 on a hair cut once a month, shops at Waitrose (higher-end grocery store) and makes sure everyone knows it. She's also aware that her errant behaviour would cost her her job, if she were ever caught. There's a danger to her behaviour, as she often pisses random people off and her husband isn't capable of backing her up if she got into trouble."

174374374,I believe I was targeted by some sort of government surveillance program. Not just on the street or online. I believe there's a certain section of the media who are also involved. I pretty much dont hear voices anymore since being on clozapine. One thing that helped me carry on with my life was that I stopped caring about what they were doing to me and i think they just gave up because i didn't let it bother me anymore.

If I start a sole proprietorship, but advertise to a big population, I alone won't be able to serve most of the individuals and my business would soon be publicly known as inefficient with respect to the ratio of actual clients to potential clients. smaller populations include those who live in certain neighborhoods or buildings, those who are physically disabled, or those who are elderly. Outside of sole proprietorship, I'm still doing research into a company that I'd like to work under. Once I'm done with the research, I'll construct my resume with the information and apply for jobs there. The sole proprietorship is more like an alternative plan.

I feel like I am getting my finances in order. I don't like owing people. It makes me anxious.

It helped in some ways (Made me realize that reality, free will, belief in God etc is all an illusion) but made it worse in others (Depersonalization/Derealization or dissociative panic attacks). I think they just wanted to diagnose me with schizophrenia so they could put me on the antipsychotic injection because I always stopped my meds and would get severely agitated with disorganized speech and thought blocking like really bad formal thought disorder.

175979672,"It's good that you're doing the dishes. I once read a story in the newspaper where the firemen told a mother of 3 young children that she needed to clean the grease off of her stove, for it was a fire hazzard. Well, from that grease, the house caught on fire one day. And she and two of her children were killed. I thought, if the fireman had stopped and cleaned the grease off of her stove himself, I mean, she had a lot to do already, raising three kids by herself, maybe that fire wouldn't have happened. So I'm reading where you see the sink full of dirty dishes, I'm thinking, why didn't she wash the dishes? And I see that you did. That's very good. I agree that it's a heck of a situation. It sounds like it's the kids who should be getting everybody's concern. Like this website advocates for problems, as noted in the anxiety resources at the top of the list of problems, including yours, that if you're positive going into a problem that you can solve it, vastly improves your chances of solving it. For 
you mind is looking for ways to solve it, not for ways to lose. So, your help is probably needed. I agree with you, I think the money should first be set aside to pay for the rent, food, electric bill. I agree with you, buying expensive toys and cell phones for everybody first, and then not having enough money to pay the rent, would flip me out, also. That would do it for me. What is the biggest one or two problems now? These people need you."

But she was very nice about it. Had a good chat. I made a joke that next time we should talk about something fun like intrusive thoughts and she marked it down, so I guess I’m having that conversation next time. I mean they’re not bad and they don’t interfere with my life, but damn they can be annoying sometimes."

175979683,"Gotta admit for a while I was drinking alcohol way more than I should. Like every night and sometimes even during working hours (working at home) I would sneak a couple shots when no one was looking. I never counted how much I drank but I would get a good buzz on, and sometimes get drunk. I’m a heavy free pourer I’ll tell you that. But I had a conversation about it a bit with my family and decided to not buy any booze for a while. Not only to save money, but because of concern over my drinking. Don’t want to become an alcoholic that’s for sure. Anyways I haven’t had anything to drink for like a month and I’m not buying any booze for a while. Thought about getting some tequila for Canada Day but eh a bottle of tequila my sister and I like is almost $60 and I didn’t want to spend the money! Gluten free beer is also like almost $4 a bottle! I forgot to tell my doctor about this when I talked to him this week, but I’ll tell my psych when I talk to her next week. I had said to her last t

175979703,"I do have insight as to why I feel like I do. All of this time while looking for help, I learned a lot. I have tricked my mind into thinking certain ways. Or how not feeling when I do talk about losses or traumas as long as they are brief thots. Sometimes my mind gets tired and I either dissociate or I can't stop the feelings, but I am 'safe' till it turns into rage. I know what I should be doing, but I don't know how to get out this deep hole I feel trapped in. I thot I had found help at a grief center here. At 2nd visit yesterday, they told me they can't treat me there. The reason was I needed more help than they could provide me. Hearing that felt like a death sentence. I know myself enough to know I can't do it without help. I needed help. I have no support in my life anymore. Nobody to help me take another step. I am too defeated after being turned away once again. I can never explain how hard it was to go to these appts. To even leave this room. To take a shower. To talk about why I was there

175979704,"I get that. Interestingly, a song can be ""playing"" and still slip out of the forefront of my consciousness: I'll be aware of it for the first few minutes, but if I get distracted some way, it will continue playing, but I will barely be aware of it. Once the distraction passes and I return to the default state I was in, the song will resume as if it never stopped. It's almost as if the music plays in real time. I attribute this to the inner idiot-savant that has, on occasions far too often to be chalked up to coincidence, allowed me to open a book to the exact page I was looking for or to know exactly what time my clock will read when I wake up in the middle of the night. Sometimes songs hijack my head. If I'm in the grocery store and am some soft rock song I never much cared for is playing, I'll keep hearing it for the rest of the afternoon. I consider this to be a nefarious form of psychic surgery. It's intrusive, manipulative and should be illegal. Heed the lyrics! It could be your subconscious

175979708,"CSA08, I think it's reassuring to anyone when the medical tests are done and you see the outcome. In my case, I had several, some were repeated from months before, but in the end they found it was my anxiety. Now that I have understanding of how anxiety was causing my own symptoms of heart and high BP problems, I have the medication that helps me deal with it and also a better outlook. All the medical personnel took my symptoms seriously and we went through the tests. And there were long discussions of how anxiety can affect our BP, heart rate, irregular rhythm, etc. Hoping you get resolution for this! Good luck with these tests. Stay well and stay informed but start back enjoying your life!"
175979709,"Hi AM and welcome to the A/P! I am sorry to hear of the past struggles you have had with your health...and the understandable anxiety that it has left in its wake. It is not unusual for an illness to be the catalyst for anxiety...especially if it was a preexisting sort of issue waiting for a trigger of sorts. The good news is that you have come very far in your journey, but wanting to feel your absolute best is of course the goal...so I am glad you are not complacent with how things are at this point...and are looking for more answers. Stress in and of itself is a normal human condition, and not always a negative thing. It keeps us sharp and motivated. It ensures we do what needs to be done, and is part of a healthy and necessary state of being. However, when it gets to the point where it affects our quality of life, or we can no longer function because it has reached toxic levels, then of course, it is time to seek help. You mentioned being on medication, but not having a very good experience, so 
not wanting to go down that path again is understandable. Have you tried the other two most reliable treatment options, therapy and self help? If not, I can't urge you enough to do so. You can find the latter at the top of our forum page in our Resources. There is lot of great material to be found there, so do have a look... ...and talk to your doctor about the therapy option. Working with a mental health specialist could help give you the tools to help manage your stress. Keep posting with us as well if you find it helpful. We understand, care and support is key! _PERSON_ Cat"

175979721,"As a bipolar, I think your doctor is doing her best to help you. You said your doctor, ""places me back on EffexorER added adderall and risperdone to the mix now. I’ve not had any episodes since this one time and she stated that I show bipolar symptoms?"" There were a number of places on the net (drugs.com) which cautioned about adderall (amphetamine) and Effexor XR (anti-depressant) together. In one case there was ""jitteriness, racing thoughts, stomach cramps, dry eyes, palpitations, tremors, and restlessness."" You can write into the search engine: adderall and Effexor XR (that combination) and see what those sites say. If you've been doing OK on that, you might want to stay on it or talk to your doctor about that. You say, ""I’m just wondering if I should be getting a second opinion or if there’s a chance that I have it and the meds I’m on now are what I needed to balance me out!"" As you say about the definition of bipolar, NO! As an amateur who does have bipolar, I don't think you hav

175979723,"Hah. Though to be fair, society should probably be open to the idea people will occasionally need mental healthcare even if they're ""normal"" and ""healthy"". Someone has their first unexpected experience with death or some other trauma? Perfectly fine for them to see a mental healthcare provider of some sort without having to have some specific diagnosis. I was talking to a teacher friend last week and he told me a story where he got in trouble during his training period. Some kid was acting out. All the other teachers seemed to have armchair diagnosis and think the kid should be medicated. My friend said ""probably not"" and that was somehow someway some kind of reprimand against him. The kids mom died. That's just rough for a young person. $#%^ happens. It's alright to feel bad sometimes, etc."
175979725,"I feel so much better today. I took 150mg of Seroquel last night.

I don't think I'll increase the injection back to 21 days. I might. I want to try 100mg Seroquel at night first. Antipsychotics make me feel kinda good! I went for a long walk today as well. Good exercise. Took 1 gram of phenibut today (I'm tolerant to 1 gram). I'll slowly decrease that and take one alprazolam every night for a week and then stop once I'm on the 100mg of Seroquel. I might take a few PRN 5mg olanzepines until Friday when I see my doctor. He'll refill the Vyvanse, Seroquel, acne cream.. And.. that's it? Yeah.. Then I have a week left of atenolol and I'll see him 7 days later to refill that and have another talk with him. So far I have it all organized and kept track of. Yesterday I couldn't keep track of what I was on and phenibut withdrawal also exacerbates psychosis. But the 
Seroquel made me more clear minded. I'm gonna research investing for a bit cuz I have all this energy and maybe do other things. I might take a 5mg olanzepine after and start reading. It seems like a stimulant or antipsychotic allows me to calm down but in different ways (Stimulant allows me to focus and antipsychotic takes away distractive thoughts).. Y'know???"

I can sympathize with what you are going through because I have some of the same thoughts and feelings that you are describing. They started when I was very young and it wasn't until I got help that I knew why I was having these thoughts and feelings. I am a very blunt person and believe lies are just some BS to hide behind. Trust me when I say I will be real and not lie to you. While I still struggle with my gender identity, harmful thoughts and my emotions it does get better! I finally decided to get help after two suicide attempts. Please don't let it get that far for you. I finally decided that it was time to get help and things got so much better for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I got on my medication and I am in therapy once a week. The fear that you talk about seems like the same things I thought. I tho
ught if I got diagnosed then people would think I was crazy and all the other _USER_ID_ that goes along with mental illness. BUT...that fear is just the negative thoughts winning. The fact that you are posting on here shows that you want help. You have taken a big step. Now it is time to reach out and get the help that you may need from mental health professionals. The nice part is that you are old enough that your parents don't even have to know that you are going to get this help. If you decide that they need to know then you have the freedom to let that be your choice. I'm not saying it won't be hard. Mental illness is hard. That's not to say that it isn't worth fighting. In the meantime there is an app that I use called Calm Harm. It helps give you distractions so that you can calm yourself and ride the wave so that you don't feel the need to self harm as much.

I have never had so much trouble training a new guy before. The boss said we'd all get to train him, but he wasn't picking up what I was laying down at all. I had to work late, a 10 hour day because I spent most of it trying to create good habits for the new kid. At my old job I was always the one to train because of my patience. Ordered a copy of my book so I can go over it on paper. I cleaned up chapter 3 and 4 a lot, plus Grammarly was a big help, thanks to my niece (sister's daughter) My nieces are really cool. I have I have 7 nieces lol isn't that crazy? My brother had a vasectomy and then he got his wife pregnant with TWINS (both girls). So he has 6 kids. Can you imagine that?

175979811,"Thanks for your note, ForeverPositive. (I like your name...) I might try medication but there are so many different ones, and the trial and error process can take a long time, and then there are the side effects... If I were retired, I might be able to deal easier with the side effects. But I am still working (at a fairly demanding job) and it is really hard to have serious side effects and still do my job. about 8 years ago, I tried Lexapro briefly - maybe 4 months or so. I started on 10mg but I could not deal with the side effects, so I reduced to 5mg. At that point the side effects disappeared but I think it was a subtheraputic dose and was not doing anything. So I went off it. (I also tried a beta blocker but it made me dizzy). The issue of other people who are close to us ""not understanding"" is a real issue. My wife's view is ""you are a strong person; just get over it."" She does not say that out of malice, but just some combination of lack of understanding and I guess frustration. Of cours
e, if I could just ""get over it"" I would do so -- gladly -- and immediately. Nobody wants to suffer. Anyway, I appreciate your note. It is good to hear from someone who can relate."

And also, am I this great guy that everyone else seems to see in me, or am I really just a tragic train wreck that I know myself to be on the inside? How much of my identity is connected to how other people see me? Do I even exist without them?"
175979814,"You said, “My doctor thinks I have anxiety and depression.” Then you say, “I havent came to a decision about taking medication.” What is it with taking medications? You’re willing to deal with turmoil for years, but taking medications that might make you better is out of the question.No wonder this keeps going on and on and seems insolvable. You won’t take your medicine. Has the doctor prescribed any for you? Have you ever taken medicine before? Webmd.com lists 10 medicines that treat both anxiety and depression. What do you have against medicine? Has not taking medicine the last 5 years helped you? Where do you think you’ll be in 5 years from now without it? According to your glass theory, about holding a glass until it gets heavy, you say, “And they relate that to how small problems begin to feel when you dont deal with them.” How are you dealing with your small problems? You said, ""I was social isolating before we all had to social isolate...I dont leave my house often bc it m
y safe area. I have a car but I get panicky driving"" If you could take your medicine it might calm you down enough to where you could drive and leave your house more often. You might be pushing yourself into a box where, even if you had to drive or get out, you might not be able to do it. Solve one half of that now, before a possible worse situation, by taking your medicine now and showing yourself you can drive and that you can get out if need be. Divide the problem in half. You are procrastinating, losing time, when perhaps a worse situation is on the way. From getting out, you might could volunteer. From volunteering, perhaps get back into the work force. Step by step. And again, did your mother or father have problems with anxiety or depression? Do any of your siblings or other relatives, aunts or uncles, have that? If they did, what did they do for it? I think it’s good that you want to continue your walks, and that you’re going to your appointments.Post Edited (_NAME_) : 4/5/2020 6:13:39 PM (GMT-6)

175979819,"It's just something I accept as a part of my life. It's the most horrifying thing ever. I have good days/weeks/months and bad days/weeks/months. So far this month has been a good month. Better than last month. I'm able to talk and be open about this fear which comforts me though. I remember saying to my mom ""I wish this wasn't a part of my existence"" and she has an aortic aneurysm, long qt syndrome and a mitral valve prolapse and she doesn't even worry about it. I believe my bad trip caused neuroplasticity (Connecting neurons in my brain very strongly) while I was checking my pulse during the trip. I believed that I died that night and I'm in another dimension where I continued to live. It's goes deep deep deep into the realm of physics and psychosis. Now I understand everything about the universe and reality and how scientists disagree and agree about the possibilities of theories. And if I could go back I'd do it all again to be as conscious and quasi-psychotic as I am. But I can't go too far i
nto the realm or I might not return. I thought I'd never return. Psychosis.. To have a bad trip is to say ""This will last forever"" (I listened to this from _NAME_ on the _NAME_ Rogan Experience). It's all real stuff. Scary but the world is making sense of itself and the awake ones like us can't take anymore chemicals. We need antipsychotics. But in the end, we don't want them because of the illness. Psychosis is the loop of fire."

He slept early last night, and has been sleeping till now, 2 PM afternoon. Says he feels tired. Does anyone have experience with this medication and had the tiredness side effect? Did the tiredness go away over time? I have a call out to the doc, am hesitant to continue given this side effect. Thanks in advance for your support!"

I gotta grow and learn and be okay. That's a good point about people being happy for me. I think it's because a lot of people are telling me I can't do X and I need to go 1 or 2 years without doing X and it feels like my performance is tied to their expressions of happiness or being proud of me. But that is a man-made expectation. I've been telling myself (because I am rather religious) to look at what God would say. I think He would look at my heart and not my performance or behavior, and I think He would accept me either way. I think I am putting unrealistic expectations on myself based on what other people are telling me to do or not to do regarding X. I just need to chill and go with the flow.

I did about half. I need to get the outside accountants to unlock July and August so I can do those months. I will try to do that tomorrow. I skyped one of the owners to ask who my boss is. I know that should be obvious but it isn't. She actually called me back to discuss it with me because there are different people to go to for different stuff. But I think how I have been doing it is okay. I like that owner she is super responsive. Her husband--the other owner--might be here tomorrow and for sure next week. I don't deal with him much. I think he is more on the manufacturing side of things and she is more on the accounting side. Occasionally he will ask me for financials or something a

174374709,"Thanks _PERSON_! I recently lost 25 pounds and am finally comfortable in my skin again. One of my fears is gaining all that weight back. Congrats on your weight loss! _PERSON_ woo! You should be really proud of yourself! It is definitely hard to lose weight when your on meds and dealing with mental illness. I ate like that too when I was on Seroquel. Abilify was not much better either. I'd eat double and triple portions of EVERYTHING. It was always at night too. I'd wake up surrounded by empty Cheeze It boxes and cookie packages that were full the day before with no memory of having eaten them. I went from 125 lbs and in just 3-4 weeks had gained 35 lbs. It didn't even help my schizoaffective disorder either. I was so let down and felt like I was a failure. Yesterday my psychiatrist started me on Vraylar (antipsychotic) and Inderal LA to control any tremors/twitching. I like the medicine so far. Yesterday I was pretty tired and spacey, but today I feel a little more awake and alert. It made me real
ly nauseous too, but I started an anti-nausea med yesterday night that actually helps, yay! I am not eating everything in sight either. It actually has the opposite effect on my appetite so that's a good sign. I am really hopeful that this will actually work for me! I've gotten my hopes up like this in the past though and been let down so I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much. If this does not work I will take your advice and check out medicines on drugs.com to find something that I think I'd be compatible with. Thanks again for taking the time to share your advice.

It utterly breaks my heart to know and see people over this Earth suffering because of this virus. I take my meds and pray daily but I am just like everyone else here who suffers with anxiety and fears.

175979871,"That overbearing and neglectful leads to ambivalent binding is well known in psychology. May also lead to borderline disorder, showing this ambivalence. But the main cause in all disorders is a trauma in early childhood (age 1,5 to 3) which results in a complex PTSD. In a normal neurological development you would learn in that age from your primary caregiver(!) to autoregulate your emotions. Although it's learned in a brain area that does not know speech or rational thinking, but only emotions, it's a kind of internal mother that is always present to calm you down when something frightening happens: ""Calm down. Mother is here. You are safe"". In order to internalize this, you need emotional experience at that age (later you don't remember) and a mother/primary caregiver who calms you right at the moment you experience it. If you don't, you will never learn, because the time window of brain developement is closed and brain developement goes on. No matter if your parents are overbearing or neglectfu
l, in both cases you don't learn to autoregulate your emotions. And you will suffer the rest of your life - pychologically and physically, including many social problems. And all ""discorders"" are just compensations of that. You develop them to get along with life. They are a cure, not a problem. But of course neurotypic people do see this differently, as you don't fit into society like they do."

I carefully experimented with what worked and what did not. I am extremely vigilant to make sure I know exactly what I am using. I learned that using any type of Sativa made my anxiousness skyrocket and I cried hard on and off for no apparent reason. That took about a year. It was before commercialization and it was under a doctor's supervision. I now choose ONLY an Indica or heavy leaning Indica Hybrid. My anxiety level decreases and my mood brightens. I am calm and can eat. I found it extremely important to make sure my environment is a place I can focus. I don't rush and imagine an inhale of medicine and an exhale of toxins. I allow myself to feel my muscles release. I have ADHD and for me I need a distraction close by. I avoid all things stressful, like knitting - I'm terrible!

I have something to feel good about for a change. My wife and I cut out roughly five hundred masks for our courageous healthcare workers!!! We were given a set of instructions on how to make the masks. I told my wife I have to do something to feel as if I am helping. There are plenty of groups on facebook asking for help or volunteers. We were putting the masks together but it was too hard as I have degenerative disc disease. Instead now we cut up all the fabric to make all the parts of a mask. We then give it to another person in our area who distributes the pieces for assembly. Its teamwork which carries the day. We have cut out five hundred over the past five days. I hope to start on the next batch of five hundred soon. God bless us all"

Then she basically told me I was wasting her time and escorted me out of the house. I wish I could of remember her name.

175979933,I’ve had issues with anxiety/stress most of my life. I’m currently taking Klonopin and Mirtazipine for anxiety. The Mirtazipine helps the most. It helps me sleep most nights. My therapist agrees with you that it’s just stress and anxiety and encourages me to resist the urge to seek more testing and doctor opinions but the pain just gets overwhelming at times. I think my GI doc suggesting another test really opened up the floodgates of doubt about my heart again. I don’t know if these things are hereditary but my late father had the same issues with chest pains but they could never find anything wrong with his heart either. To answer your question yes I’m fully vaccinated. I appreciate your response.

175979935,"Oh, no worries. I realize how odd it probably sounds. It’s difficult to see it as much of a problem as I’m not at all distressed by it, I’m far more curious about how it “works” (or doesn’t work.) It seems like fear is a form of torture in and of itself at least in the extremes, however, from what I’ve read about the entire topic and from what I’ve learned more directly over time. I can see that fear torments you. It does sound rather painful in many ways, painful in the psychological sense and, in the physical sense as well ... I think this lack of fear is why I’ve never been truly affected by what would have been catastrophic trauma for anyone else."

It might be a PTSD thing? I had a really bad experience with a procedure a few years ago and I think the anxiety built up over time. You might be right about it being too much, it kind of feels like when autistic kids have meltdowns because of sensory overloads. I don't scream, though, I just cry."

For example, I take Effexor and Remeron (a potent combination and one that a psychiatrist has to take seriously because it can cause serotonin syndrome) plus my antipsychotics plus Xanax. I don't know if since you technically have bipolar that you're supposed to avoid antidepressants. I think we may have talked about this on here before.

I took cough meds per doctor's advise but it created digestive sensitivities. Anything I ate gives me discomfort and It seems to be on my throat forever. Then breathing becomes tough. I get chills. Feeling light headed. I found a you-tube site on calming music and some Christian music and inspiration. This had helped calm me down. But when there's any discomfort in my body especially on my stomach area this triggers breathing and chest congestion. I feel bad as my husband panics every time I feel this way. Any suggestions. Thank you."
175979971,"Hey there, that must be terrible to be dealing with in this time of uncertainty. You deserve to feel validated about how you’re feeling, and I’m sorry that this lockdown has affected you in this way. It’s difficult to stay away from public places for an extended period of time, especially with your loved ones moving away so soon. I can’t even imagine the amount of emotional stress this would cause, when you’re already living a life apart from others. I’m so glad you have a cat, it’s really a blessing because they are amazing to keep me sane as well. I’m not 70+, but we are living very cautiously as my father isn’t strong at all (if he got the virus). I’m really glad you are able to do face time with your therapist, that will prove to be very beneficial to continue to receive support when you can’t drive to meet with her. Have you mentioned these feelings to your therapist? A few things I’d recommend: - Face time/message your loved ones often – you’ll feel more connected, 
especially with them moving soon - Have alarms set and a schedule, as if this virus didn’t exist. Set an alarm to wake up, have breakfast, get dressed for the day, have your morning coffee, laundry, cleaning, etc. This will help you to feel like life is more normal, since your body is used to the usual things you used to do every day. - Find a hobby to keep you busy when you’re at home - Playing a virtual game with family/friends – something like Yahtzee, Uno, etc. Also, finding things to do to calm your anxiety could be: listening to calming instrumentals, coloring, spending time cuddling with your cat, knitting, praying, reading, journaling, having a bath with a bath bomb, etc. just to name a few. Find what works for you, make a list so you can turn to the list whenever you have time or when your anxiety increases! Thank you for reaching out, I hope something I have suggested will help you. Keep fighting, you’ve got this! xx"

Last year on Thanksgiving night I Possible trigger: attempted suicide and even though I didn't go to the hospital or anything afterward, which looking back was really stupid of me not to have gone, and even though I am in no way Possible trigger: suicidal this year, just thinking about last year makes me worry that the same thing is going to happen this year which is ridiculous, or so I thought. I texted a friend to talk to her through these thoughts. And she was like, It's not silly. It's documented that anniversaries trigger memories and prompt repeat behavior. (She didn't cite her source so I am just taking her word on that.) So at least I am not being silly and/or ridiculous. But now I am dealing with the anxiety. EEK. It seems like I am super sensitive. Even when coworkers and stuff are responding to me, I'm taking inflection and lack of detail

175979991,Wow I'm learning about stimulant-antipsychotic dopamine theories. It's extremely interesting. Stimulants increase dopamine and cause tolerance over time. Antipsychotics increase dopamine but cause intolerance over time. Using them both together cancels each other out yet still increases dopamine so you don't build tolerance to either. People with ADHD have larger bursts of dopamine but lower dopamine in synapses.

175979993,"Hi _PERSON_, Is it winter where you are? With snow and all? I been having a hard time getting out this winter. I just don't feel like making the effort or dealing with people. I am waiting for spring and hope that when it gets here it will be easier for me to leave the house. Don't feel bad that you are not working at this time. But keep actively seeking. I think it would be good for you. It stinks when you don't feel comfortable in your own home. Been through that before. I am glad your father in law's stay is only temporary. You mentioned before about feeling like you are leaning on alcohol too much. Do you ever think about going to AA? Alcohol is just another crutch. You think it is making you feel better and relaxed but actually it is a depressant and it adds to anxiety. I probably wouldn't feel so concerned but my sister in law may be dying from constant alcohol use through out her life. She is in the hospital right now barely hanging on. It makes me so sad. You are young. Try not to depend on 
alcohol to feel better. It is a bottomless pit. Can you volunteer somewhere? Often it can lead to a permanent job. There are so many different gratifying things that you could do. Even making things and donating them to a senior center??? It sounds like you need something constructive to make you feel good. Depression often causes a person to feel tired. Anxiety makes you feel stressed. You have both going on by the sound of it. I can't remember if you go to therapy or take meds??? It kind of sounds like you need to take some steps to move forward. Find something you enjoy doing, or volunteer. Start a project, a good book. You have the tools, you just have to realize it. I think you are stronger than you think. Have a great rest of the day. Best wishes. Hugs, _NAME_..."

I'd feel alone and not sure what to do - But I'd have my own space. I want to go to school and eventually get off of disability. I'm just extremely confused. I'm only starting to realize now that on top of mental illness, I have to go into a completely new realm of adulting that I didn't really know existed.

And that should be a comfort right? But it is hard knowing that you’re living not because you want to but because you would make someone else sad. I just try to remind myself that I can be anyone I want to be. Because my family loves me I know that I can do whatever I want with my life and they will still be there. The thought of screwing up and having to drop out of college terrifies me, but I know that I can leave it all behind and do whatever I want because they love me. I don’t have to be stuck.

Now I see people in our government who only wish to further themselves at the expensive of the poor and those incapable of taking care of themselves.

175980048,"First check his medicaid program to see if these treatments would be covered by his current NY Medicaid anyway. You could also check the Medicaid program in NJ, and see if they are any more generous than NY. Each state runs its own Medicaid program, with federal 'block grant' funds and their own contributions. I would suspect NY would be more generous because the state is bigger and may have more funds. If NY is more generous, maybe he should keep or establish residence in NY. If NJ is more generous, he could establish residency with you. He could try to fudge it, but penalties for fraud are serious. Lastly, SSDI is a federal program, so it won't matter which state he lives in to keep it.

Like everyone else, I feel frightened when checking out the latest news - I always hope to see something optimistic to hold onto. And, what has not helped, I believe I am experiencing a negative side effect from taking a recently prescribed medication - doxycylcline. I had a tick bite and although it was a deer tick which tested negative for Lyme, I did develop cellulitis, probably from scratching the itchy bite site. After taking it for the recommended 7 days, I started experiencing anxiety. _PERSON_, I came across your site with the topic of anxiety and doxycycline - so knowing it is a probable cause does help lessen my fears of it not ever going away. I am hopeful that after a while, this unbearable feeling will start to leave me.

175980102,"I put all the stuff in the crockpot for the hamburger hash recipe. It's cooking now. I had an issue with the 2nd can of condensed mushroom soup. The pop off lid broke off of it and my can opener wouldn't open it. I don't have a knife strong enough to bust it open so I had to replace the 2nd can with some plain yogurt. It should take on the flavor of the other can of mushroom soup, meat, cheese, potatoes, onions and garlic powder once it's cooked, so I hope that will be alright and not turn out horrible or something. I didn't know what to do cause I didn't want to waste everything I put together ."

I don’t know why I suddenly want to learn these art things. It makes me happy is all I know. I painted for 7 hours today and it was really relaxing. Once I was done though I started feeling empty.

175980108,"Morning Been up all night. Because I discovered Steam and PC gaming and all the games it has. Yikes. I was eager to set aside 20 dollars for final fantasy online. I’m tired. I think I’m a bit sad too tho because I keep thinking of my neighbor. I left his wife a message on her Facebook. It’s insane how everything is right now. Just insane. I keep seeing someone famous people die everyday from Coronavirus. I mean he died from copd but the world is just insane. I did a lot of sitting at my desk and just thinking. Mainly cuz there’s nothing else to do at night and I was waiting for my debit card to reactivate for the day. My bank always freezes it for stupid reasons IMO. If I make a large purchase, or use a different computer to buy something, or whatever. Etc too many purchases. I make a lot of purchases some times but it’s always multiple purchases for stuff under 10 dollars. Like a 3 dollar game or paying for my Apple Music or iCloud storage. Or apps I have. But I feel like the ones I pay 
for, I need. I listen to music now almost 24/7 practically. I have since January. I took like a 6 month accidental break from music cuz I was working at the time. No free time. All of a sudden I’m a gamer ever since I bought Pokémon in November. I’ve been playing games more and more since then. (After 10 years!) but _NAME_ says my choices of games are weird. He’s very straightforward. Likes call of duty and really popular games. I like Japanese rpg’s and indie games like those mental illness related games. I’m ok tho. Took my meds and ate. Im just kinda bored but I shouldn’t be. At all. I’m tired too. I have so much technology at my fingertips that I don’t even know where to start or what to do with these things."

Also they asked us to pay with money orders for payment style plan. Which is weird.

But there’s multiple violations within all this situation. So I’m writing to corporate and the city here."
175980115,I'm scared. I want to read. I'm still. I had a ****_NAME_ up life. So did my parents and my whole family. Life is this way for all.
175980116,"Hi LMD...I too have recently had to deal with sleeplessness due to anxiety. What helped me was reciting a quote I got from one of the links in the resources section namely, 'Stop! These thoughts are not good for me. They are not healthy or helpful thoughts and I have decided to move in a better direction and learn to think differently' and also 'I will be alright. The feelings I have are not rational. I'll just relax, calm down and everything will be alright.' I was able to regain my sleep. I've read that you have to stop the thoughts because they are causing the anxiety and related symptoms. Also I used melatonin to help me sleep until I was able to come off of it."
175980117,I hate my life. What I go through to keep on working is torture. I just dont see a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe I could get back on another ssri for my anxiety but then I'd be more of an asshole. It's tough to work when the only thing I feel are negative emotions.
175980118,"If you’re a star trek fan, it’s like watching a human explain to Data what an emotion is. Data studies it, knows what it is, observes it in his crew mates, but he himself just doesn’t understand because he doesn’t experience it. But let’s call Data an expert in human emotion."

175980125,"I took an Ativan because I felt better the other night when I did. I do feel better but I want to take a tiz too. That would be a good combo and I have Benadryl too, although it doesn't have much of its own affect compared to the antihistamine I can't remember the name of. I could take half a tiz and a Benadryl and I think I'd have a much nicer evening. Have to wait until after they bring my nighttime meds."
175980126,"Still obsesseed with Stardew Valley so I played that last night I downloaded the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon demo too but haven't tried it out yet, maybe I'll do that later Fire Emblem looks so good, that's definitely on my list of games to eventually get I'm trying to complete my Pokedex in Pokemon Sword, got a long way to go, then shiny hunting after I get the shiny charm. I came across one randomly recently and caught it, a gastrodon. Would be cool to be able to get a shiny of all the Pokemon, that would take sooo long lol but would be a cool goal."
175980127,"Session with Dr. _PERSON_ went okay yesterday. It is weird doing telehealth with him sort of because I have never seen him in person. Whereas with Pdoc I've seen him in person and regular T does phone calls only or in person. He kept reminding me that I have a thought disorder (schizoaffective disorder depressed type) and that some of my thoughts may not be real. This totally confounds me. I mean I *have* them so how can they not be real? I mean, they certainly exist. I'll give an example. Sometimes there is a demon in my head and he tells me things mostly things like to hurt myself. But he isn't always there. And his voice is inside not outside which is how I know he is in my head. I have voices that are outside of my head and they are not in my head but I hear them. But he is in my head because the voice is inside of my head. He said lets just suppose this isn't real. He said some people think they can communicate with aliens or that the CIA is after them (who knows, maybe they are!) and how that 
isn't real. Now I don't know if aliens exist but if people think they can talk to them, maybe they can. And the CIA well who knows what they are up to. I generally think my life is far too boring for the CIA to be after me personally. Like I think they have other suspects that have much more interesting lives. But who knows, since I was hospitalized IP maybe they do have me on some sort of watch list and monitor my movements. If so they have a very boring job because I go to work, Target, home, Del Taco, and Church. Pretty boring. Back to the demon thing. Most of ya'll know that I am very religious. I believe in Angels and so I believe in their counterpart, Demons. To say they aren't real goes against some pretty ingrained religious beliefs that I have, which are not likely to change. Actually he didn't say they didn't exist. He said the opposite of good is not evil, it's the absence of good. But I don't know that I believe that either. Too much fire and brimstone in my religious background. So he said when I 
have a demon in my head then I am supposed to think good thought and if I can't think good thoughts I am supposed to read good thoughts. Like affirmations or a religious text. Ha. I should read _NAME_ or Revelations. That's a religious text but one that scares the bejeebies out of me. He said if I was Catholic I could have an exorcism. I told him I'm not Catholic and that my denomination doesn't do exorcisms. But doesn't that mean that they are real if you have to do something to get rid of them? See the whole thing was rather confusing. I do like that we did at least talk about it in some detail. Regular T just skips over stuff like this and I am left feeling like I don't know what to do with it. I'm just not sure what he is trying to tell me. The whole thing was rather confusing. Anyway I see him in two weeks. This time at 4 PM so I won't have to miss any work. I'm happy about that. Comments are okay. I am rather confused on how the whole thing went anyhow. I don't think I could be more confused than I am n

I remember someone saying in a reply to a previous post of mine a few years back, I think it may have been you, to go into a psychiatrist and the best time to do so is when you are feeling ok and stable not when you are in the midst of panic, which I have been apart from the living situation but that’s a separate issue. that made sense to me and stuck with me and I did it. I only went a couple of weeks ago and I’ll have to wait 6 weeks to take anything as I’m currently pregnant unexpectedly yet again, but near the end. It’s another reason that’s pushed me to go because how I’m going to look after 4 kids and feel the way I have I have no clue, it doesn’t sound like I’ll have much choice but to take this medication. It does sound like it could benefit me, I’ll have to mentally prepare for potential weight gain, hopefully I get lucky and it won’t happen

175980161,"I was wondering if you could expand a little more on this (or anyone here). I had a similar thought as a kid, I was extremely uncomfortable over the concept of living with another person when I thought about it. To this day it still makes me uncomfortable. As for the OP.. I have dreamed about some of these things below and I really think that these are the visions I think of the most. I am interested in world building a lot and i like creating a lot of environments, i apologize if some of these are a little over the top. A crystallized blue castle sits alone in an endless black void. There are trees that glow but they are made of spheres and not leaves. I wouldn't know what was in it, I don't want to go inside because I dislike big spaces. i would hope if anything there were many small rooms in the large castle. There is a forest covered in Sepia and people are tied to the trees or hanging from them. I recently found out my name meant ""Tree Dweller"" in a certain mythology so now i just want to im
agine the trees. Sometimes people and their limb like arms/fingers/legs morph into the tree like structure. I just want to incorporate as many trees as i can in my thoughts now these days. I also imagine angels staring at me as i walk through forests. Though i see them more like lively decoration. I never really think about what they are like as beings. On the other hand, i draw a lot of patterns in my art. I imagine the way they look in my head a lot and i see them twisting and turning, i see them more as alive for some reason. I have some rooms from my personal life I think a lot about. I remember the dark green carpet and white walls of my grandmother's house as a kid. I really like incorporating that dark green carpet wherever I can. It brings back a lot of nostalgia for some reason. The broken down theater i used to frequent in, in college. I still think about it to this day because it would always be unlocked and i would always sit on the dark staircase between classes."

175980164,"Well tbh big pharma is a big conspiracy and we all know this. Look how much our meds cost. The government will be cracking down on pharmacists, more people are becoming pharmacists and they're already making less money. Also, AI will replace pharmacists. So I thought about becoming a pharmacologist (Which is what I really wanted to be except I didn't want to dedicate my whole life to working) but really I'd probably go into other fields of research like my cousin. So basically I have no idea what I want to do still. I don't want to be chasing money either but it would be nice to find a way to make enough money that I can be comfortable for the rest of my life and travel etc..

With a kid that used live with him where he hung himself.. on the anniversary he wanted to book a hotel with me what a sick ****. Then I think well, other labels aside, I'm not a pedophile but what if I'm still attracted to people that are my current age when I'm his age before he died (50 something)?

175980172,I have really bad anxiety when it comes to thinking about the possibility of other conditions. I sometimes feel like I am on the verge of losing it and then I think when did the people who lost it know they were going to lose it. does it just happen out of nowhere of is there a period of slowly losing it? then I work myself up and then panic sets in and I'm going into a panic attack. I have spoke to my therapist about it and she said that most people who lose it don't know or are aware they are losing it. gave me little to no comfort. but I get where you are coming from. seizures happen in my family and I sometimes wonder if I am going to have a seizure and I live alone and get scared who would be around or what will happen if I have a seizure. not sure how to get by with this. just kinda vented don't know how I contributed to the topic but thats my experience

175980178,I haven't played much the past week. Not as much as I normally do. I think once I'm finished packing and getting things taken care of at my old place I'll be able to focus and play more because that has been stressing me out and taking up time each day.
175980179,"I know 2020 has had an awful ripple effect on the mental health of many people, and I'm no different. I've always had a rather unstable mental state, I'd go from being all smiles and upbeat to downtrodden and bleak in a short moment. I'd literally feel like I was being weighed down by my negative energy. Every day I have horrible thoughts about myself, saying that I'm an awful person, that I deserve to die, that everyone would be happier if I was gone. Sometimes I can kick those thoughts. Other times I need to cope with them by joking about it (i.e. jokes about being bad at something or unloved). But some days it just reaches an apex that nothing will solve. I'm also a drinker. I honestly do not believe I am an alcoholic, and I certainly don't display the symptoms associated with alcoholism, but it never helps my thoughts. I'm constantly worried that as time goes on, my reliance on alcohol will grow stronger. The other day, fueled by self-loathing and propelled by lots of alcohol, I prepared to jum
p off of a hotel balcony. Everything just felt so hellish. I always feel like I'm going around in circles, never accomplishing anything. I can never escape myself or my reality. I'm always going to be a panicky, depressive mess who missed out on every good formative experience. I figured, it was too late for me. Thankfully my brother and his girlfriend were there to stop me from jumping off of the balcony. In hindsight it wasn't tall enough, but the intent was clearly there. What feels so awful is that on days where I don't want to die, death terrifies me more than anything. Literally my biggest fear. So I'm caught in this cruel catch-22 where I simultaneously can't stand being alive but also am too scared to die. Except when I'm not. I just want to break the cycle. I just want to actually enjoy life. I just want the nightmare to end."

175980204,"Very Interesting - thank you for answering If you decide to add more, I moved my response over to the Maladaptive Daydreaming vs. Schizoid Thought Life thread to prevent this original thread from getting too off-topic (habit of mine) Also, over to that thread because these are all topics and ways of thinking that make up my ""thought life"" + being able to graze on relevant information can lead to me being less ""maladaptive"" in my visions and behavior as a result (albeit only incrementally less because being the stubborn and defiant soul that I am, most of it passes right through me). Because of this, trying to sort through my disorganized ideas under that thread can qualify as on-topic for this subforum (I believe) However, if you prefer to respond over here, I won't argue that either."
175980205,"Hey! I diagnosed with adhd when I was an adolescent. In 2012, I attended my first rehab facility and was diagnosed with anxiety depression and ptsd. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, after years of people telling me that I had bipolar and me never accepting it. My god puts my boyfriend in my life. He sits me down and says “ I really need you to listen to what I’m about to tell you , because I’ve been there, and I’ve been treated for multiple things, and now currently I’m not taking any medicine. “But I think you are bipolar and you should talk to your doctor about it.” And for once in my life I didn’t freak out and listened to what he had to say. I’m not accepting of the idea that I have BP1. I had acceptance to listen to him, and willingness to talk to my doctor about it. But I’m embarrassed that I have it. And friends and family aren’t sure if it’s a true diagnosis or not. I try and knowledge myself about it, but it really hurts me .. god planned it out for me, and kept 
me sober this long for a reason..."

175980213,Hi. I certainly cannot say what you should do but when I began Lexapro years ago the doc said I could take a benzodiazepine as needed while getting used to it. And when i recently began Zoloft the doc said the same. I couldn’t tolerate the Lexapro at my starting dose. In hindsight I should have started with a lower dose.

175980215,"In some parts of the United States snow is already on the ground, in some places it has been for quite a while (hello, _USER_ID_). I do not care for snow. I have lived places with blizzards and they can be fun for a bit but then the dirty slush is left behind and it just feels dirty everywhere. I now live in the South and prefer my winters. I did not see a single snow flake last year and that was perfectly fine with me. Seasonal Affective Disorder, or S.A.D, is a mental condition in which a person’s mood is affected by the season. Although this a condition that can be diagnosed, I believe a lot of people feel the effects of seasonal change, including those of us who live with bipolar disorder. Already with the waning light, I feel more lethargic and sad. This happens every year. My deeper, longer depressive episodes lurk in the shadows of winter. Conversely, my manic and hypomanic states tend to occur in spring and especially summer. Read more here: https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/20

175980216,"Depended on the situation. I did well as a store manager. No one hovering over me, was mostly dealing with training new employees, customer service, and doing my own thing. The owner, when there, was mostly in their office. It was easy and people found me pleasant. However, office setting middle management was a nightmare. The standard employees were fine but the people with power were too much to handle. Always asking for things and wanting more (things I didn't even do), always blaming me for mistakes, always judging me for how I did things and complaining. Once I quit they asked me back. It was ridiculous. I quit the store manager job for essentially the same reason though--hating my boss. Once I spot blood in the water I develop a rich resentment. I guess this is more an antisocial PD thing, issues with authority. I despise all my bosses."

Im stuck in a emotional wast land with out the energy to get out. Im afraid I'll never get my strength back to fight my way out of this. I know I will never be the person I was befor all my traum. Im afraid life will always feel like this. Im afraid I dont have the strength to keep going. Im afraid of giving up.
175980223,"Weed does that for me, to a point. I think it's because anxiety freezes up my head. It restricts free thinking. Once relaxed, I can access my thoughts more easily. Anxiety seems to put up a barrier between me and my thinking. I know this to be true because on workdays I do crossword puzzles while commuting to work, but I only am able to get the obvious answers. Later that evening, if I take out the same puzzle after smoking, I'll nail it."

I am having this anxiety that I may leave alone for the rest of my life. I had cancer 10 years ago, but I survived, at that time, I was all alone and did everything to survive. After that, someone came into my life and I was so happy, my world changed, and felt like I got a family now. That, someone, was my girlfriend. My family was not able to accept the fact that I was lesbian, and they end up abandoning me. But my girlfriend's family accepted me, especially her mom. I thought now I will never be alone again, but just this year, we broke up. We stayed as friends, we used to text each other and call whenever we got time. Her mom was still in contact with me. Sometimes we used to meet at Target. But soon, out of nowhere, she blocked me from everywhere, even though I accept this reality and respect her decision, I don't like the fact that I told her time and again, that I 
have no one other than her, but even then her mom also blocked me and now I am left alone. My worst nightmare of alone coming to reality. I am just not liking this. :("

175980238,For a long time now I’ve been suffering from anxiety and depression. My anxiety is usually triggered when in big places or when I kind of feel like I am not on a path of life and I’m feeling just lost in general. Sometimes I have zero idea of why I get anxiety. I am currently in a new relationship and due to covid it’s honestly been the hardest so I’ve been struggling between staying in school online and balancing this long distance relationship at the same time. I have faced abandonment my whole life starting when my dad left and now it has just been a constant pattern of male figures in my life just walking out on me. Obviously with that you start to think about wether you’re enough or not or if it’s even your fault to begin with. I struggle to keep those thought and letting my past creep into my present and it truly has been affecting our relationship because of the fear I have of yet another man leaving me. My depression comes more in waves of just sadness I don’t really get harmfu
l thoughts of suicide or self harm like I did in the past I just get upset and I get into this mood where I struggle because I am just constantly trying to figure out why I am upset and it’s frustrating.

Its interesting to me because I think I may have a ""disorganized thinking"" type of schizoaffective/ schizophrenia, and this is vital for actually accomplishing anything, but the more advanced you get the more vital it is it seems. Like coding I would think requires a great deal of ability to organize your thinking/thoughts and apply that organization. I think (after years of struggling) that the basics seem to help... Like reestablishing order through reminders and actually manually organizing things on paper so they cannot get distorted. As far as coding, this may give you an impression of my ability to code. I think it was last year I spent like six months trying to make a basic portfolio website, can't handle CSS and HTML. Come to think of it maybe that might be something you could do.

I had a psychotic break do to having schizophrenia at the time I had no idea what schizophrenia was and would’ve of never guessed that I had it. Well it lead to me having a run in with a couple of police officers. Instead, of the police officers trying to help me at a time where I desperately needed help I was tazed multiple times and repeatedly kicked in the head and stomped in the head. In the end I had a gun shoved into my back and pushed against my spine. The officers where screaming to stop moving but it’s difficult when you’ve never been tazed before, and you have multiple electrical currents coursing through your body. It was my first time ever having a run in with the law and I thought it would be my last. I forgave the officers because it’s more imp
ortant that I heal and recover rather then hold resentment. I hope you know that your life has value and that you are a blessing everyday that you’re able to breathe. We all have meaning to our life, we wouldn’t be here if we weren’t. I encourage you to go outside and look at the sky and notice how beautiful it is. I had to let go of the past to move forward, I hope you realize that if you are alive and still breathing, you can make a difference in someone’s life.

When my Dad had cancer, he was diagnosed at a regular hospital. They said he had lung cancer. My dad never smoked or anything. They tried to do a biopsy two or three times but couldn't get a bite out of the tumor. They were going to take out his lung. My Mom was like we are going to City of Hope which is a cancer hospital here in So. Cal. They did their own biopsy and it was not lung cancer, it was Non-Hodgkins lymphoma which had formed in the lung. The other hospital would have taken out the lung and wouldn't have cured the cancer! Plus when they thought it was lung cancer, it was like really bad prognosis. When they found out it was Non-Hodgkins lymphoma stage 2 they were like, you're going to be fine. Chemo. Radiation. You'll be fine. And he was. And he is 9 years cancer free. But I think a cancer hospital is so important 
to ""get it right"" I mean, that's what they do all day every day so they have the knowledge and the resources. So if you Sister can go to a cancer hospital, I would think that would be really good. Best wishes to her and you. And your Mom. and lots of hugs too. _PERSON_"

Finally figured out it was the 10mg increase on the Vyvanse. I didn't have any more refills of the higher dose Vyvanse but I did of the lower dose, so I asked the pharmacist to just fill that. So she did. And now I can sleep much better. So I asked the Pdoc just to write it for the lower amount because I cannot sleep on the higher amount. So he did."

So, I bought myself a very small (3 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" ), silver recorder and player from Amazon. I used it to record/play music also. I put it on record when I'm at the Doctors or at a meeting, etc and play it back when I am at home. It works well and wasn't expensive."

175980298,"Thanks people for replying! I also wanted to know about another thing. I often will act on impulses to remove all notifications from my iPhone. Do you guys think this is a strange behavior? I sometimes think I am acting weird by doing this. I guess I think by removing all of the notifications, I will become undistractable or something of the like. But I often cannot persist with this behavior for long because I need to know certain things, like WhatsApp notifications and texts, etc. I was just wondering if you thought this behavior was strange or if you have any tips on how to change how I act around this. Thanks. Also, as for drinking, I am going to keep it to a moderate amount, since I know drinking too much is bad, but I think it's fine with my meds. (I don't take Xanax very often though it is prescribed for me for anxiety if I need it)."

175980300,I had a pillow for the floor when I had an office to myself. Occasionally I would rest under the desk. I never did that before psychosis though.
174375382,As far as religion I meant for the exploration to give your subconscious more choices than pure evil. I don’t know why psychosis tends towards the spiritual even among atheists but it does....with a little luck your brain will focus on shiva or Vishnu instead ? I personally found animal spirits most interesting thus shamanism dominated for me.

175980303,"vkj: I don't think like that. I enjoy living alone. Earlier in life, I didn't like the idea of being alone for a long time. But after I was in a difficult marriage for many years, when that ended through an illness, I didn't have any desire to be living with anybody. I am concerned about health problems and nobody's in the house. Then I thought, why not learn to use the cell phone and carry it with you in case you need it? That was a good idea in theory, but then it keeps running out of battery power, then running of minutes, then they change my number because I haven't updated the minutes lately. So, my self-help system is in _USER_ID_. Sorry to hear about being raised in a difficult situation. I was raised in a negative household. Glad you learned how to be more composed when problems occur. I just assume if I get sick, if I can make it to a phone, I will have some help come in and prepare my meals, sort of thing. And if its bad, I'll have to go to a nursing home.

health while I have it."

I think it takes genius to shorten an idea down while keeping the denseness, these books ahve done that. You might laugh, but i also bo
ught one on Jesus. Then maybe I'll read the new testament again. Maybe I'll write a book on the new testabment because the best way to learn is to write about it. My grandmother would certainly appreciate it. I have more money saved up than I ever have in my life now. I have to figure out what I should do with it, certainly not spend it.

175980318,"I have seen 3 psychiatrists and 1 psych RN. Two of the psychs were very laid back and pretty much said maybe we could try some ssris and maybe they would help,which one would I like to start with. Lexipro caused itching and swelling (no help w/anxiety), Zoloft caused suicidal thoughts (not helpful with anxiety), Prozac at best numbed me a bit, but did not help enough with the anxiety and caused a 30 lb weight gain within 3 months - 4 yrs later, I still have been unable to lose that weight, which has been a major blow to my comfort and self esteem. I was also given Xanax which did/does help w/panic attacks, but isn't a daily med. Psych RN offered medical marijuana - not really helpful for daily anxiety and DR, but has been helpful for my menstrual discomfort. One psych said that she thought I was bipolar (even though I have never had a manic episode and do not experience any big highs) she said she felt this was a possible diagnosis because my reaction to Zoloft (suicidal thoughts) was ""not normal"
". No p-doc has ever addressed any of my physical symptoms. It's usually completely glossed over. I've been reading a lot of books about thyroid health - of all the symptoms I have had, the one thing I have actually been diagnosed with is hypothyroidism, which apparently is tricky because everyone has their own level of thyroid hormones that is best for them. It's also not something that is tested unless you have symptoms - so I have no idea what my levels were when I felt healthy. Also, since the thyroid regulates and is involved with so many different biological functions, it can cause somewhere near 300 different symptoms! The problem is, I can't find a doctor that tests all of the thyroid functions, the gold standard is TSH. And most doctors say if your TSH is within the normal range, you're fine. The normal range is very broad (0.4 - 4.0 or some doctors go by the older standard of 0.5 - 5.0), but a lot of my symptoms seem to be on that long list of things thyroid patients deal with (painful/heavy periods
, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, sore throats, fatigue, feeling cold, exercise intolerance, inability to lose weight, gerd, etc.)."
175980319,"_PERSON_ said... The 10 mg seem to be a better dose. The nights seem to be the worst and at first they were giving me Ativan to calm down a bit. I am also no Metoprolol for PVC's. She added Klonopin for nights instead of Ativan and I tried it last night but it didn't help me sleep. I tried the Melatonin instead for nights. Trying to find the right fit for me. I will meet with a therapist on Tuesday to start therapy to help. You sound like you have a doctor who is really engaged in treating you, I haven't found that in a doctor in a while though. I wonder if this medicine can help me with anxieties and depressions."

""How's your schizophrenia?"" I said ""I'm doing great"". I feel like he judged me for having schizophrenia. I hate that. Got my meds refilled. It was a 4 minute conversation."
175980325,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. I sent him a really nice thought out email (in my opinion) and told him that our goals were diverging and I really needed to focus on my goal and that was not happening and that doing Skype in my dining room was really not a good option for therapy. I told him he was very helpful to me and that I planned on doing a lot of the stuff that we practiced (there's a few things I'm not going to do). And that I thought it best if we just went back to being Pastor/Parishioner and of course stayed friends. He took it well. He said he wants the best for me and if I get in a tight spot to call him.

175980333,"Hi all, I went to my primary care doctor today for bloodwork, since I know that thyroid problems can cause anxiety. My doctor ordered the tests and we talked a bit. She was surprised that my new psychiatrist ordered me to take the buspar as needed. She says it should be taken twice a day and may take a couple of weeks to see improvement. That seems to be what I'm reading online. We are stopping my thyroid med and if needed, will switch to synthroid. I was taking Armour thyroid, which apparently is not stay at a consistent level in your blood, causing ups and downs. Now with the anxiety, depression has reared its ugly head. My doctor said a switch may be in order from lexapro to another ssri. She knows I went to see a psychiatrist, but I think she just wants to help me, since I was basically bawling in her office the whole time. I will take the buspar twice a day. Just confused about going back to the psych. All in all, this stinks right now."

175980338,"I love video games also! It makes me happy to read about anyone who has a passion for handheld devices particularly! I probably own most of the 3ds games the original post mentioned. I also own a variety of retro Gameboy, Gameboy Color, and Gameboy Advance games that I enjoy playing along with my gamecube and N64. The Switch is pretty cool as well as far as contemporary stuff goes. (Obviously I'm a Nintendo fanatic!) I'm a huge Pokemon fan. Some other favorite titles are _NAME_, _NAME_ Bros., Animal Crossing, Final Fantasy, Monster Hunters, Stardew Valley, Terraria, Tem Tem, Diablo, and many others. When my mind won't shut down an ol' nostalgic video game is the best medicine for me. It only takes ten minutes and that's enough to jump start me back into a normal rhythm and continue on if I need it. I've never really gotten into open world games consistently but I have had fun with them. They are very involved and that is what tends to turn me away. I have a big enough checklist of games I want to p

174375428,"Schizophrenia chances increase 50 fold with Possible trigger: Childhood sexual trauma When I was a kid, I was way too smart. My IQ must have been way higher than average for just a kid. I remember making a bowl of cereal and my parents said ""We're going upstairs to sleep"" in the middle of the day. I could hear them. Theres been many really disturbing instances like that. They thought I was stupid. And not only that, I knew they knew that they thought that I was stupid and I knew I was supposed to be too stupid to know. I knew that I was just a little kid (Like a few years old). I felt psychotic in those moments. It's probably why I'm asexual. It's nothing like what has happened to most people with that type of trauma but I had terrible OCD as a kid so it replayed in my mind over and over. Now I know that's completely normal. But I didn't know that when it happened. I thought I was solipsistic and I was the only one in the universe and I was God. That's kind of why I hate God. Because he was me."
174375415,"Yeah I mean people say bipolar isn't a chemical imbalance unless they've seen someone with bipolar having a severe episode. If that's not enough, I'll ask them what happens when they take MDMA.. woosh.. mania.. chemical imbalance.. Schizophrenia is a tough one too because the only thing that seems to really help is antipsychotic medication. And they're trying hard (I hope) to invent and test better antipsychotics that work for treatment resistant people with less side effects. Reassurance always makes me feel better because part of it is not trusting reassurance but also not trusting yourself. Reassurance just to trust yourself makes the psychosis at least a bit more manageable and less of an alone feeling."
175980340,I'm glad you're getting something out of the forum. Where else are you going? There aren't a lot of places for schizoids that I have found.

I was torn up for a good 2 weeks about that and that experience at that clinic. But other than that I’ve stopped drinking for now. Drinking does slow me down to the point where I sleep But I noticed in the past year it gives me anxiety. Alcohol does.

( Tell boss you work better and harder this way! ) 3. Use a ""white noise"" machine or listen to earphones to drown out other sounds at work. 4. Stick to doing just one task at a time .

175980397,"best thing to do is therapy, secondly i'ld try to check for a problematic behavior in the family, it could be a trauma she had been through, it could be a long lasting behavior that maybe you dont even notice, what im saying is that its important to make sure the source of the disorder is not still floating in the house, the reason for the behavior is early childhood-infancy intrusion of privacy, so try to check that field and be honest with yourself for her sake, maybe even try to get an outside opinion, my parents still dont recognize / deny their behavior, so it could be something you aren't aware of. about expectations and pushing - this subject is problemetic, if you push her you might make her do something she isn't interested in doing reluctently, if you dont push her she might not do anything at all, i dont know the situation so i cant know the right thing to do in her case, but what i do know is that you have to notice the implication of your expectations, try to notice when she doesnt wan
t, try to give her a voice because we usually struggle to express our needs, ask her for her opinion, keep in mind you may be asking for her opinion for years untill she might finally develop an opinion, im not talking about an opinion about a future job, but about small things, what food she prefers and so on. on the same note- try to let her feel free to get mad at you, i think anger is the first step of leting things out, the first emotion that pops up, you can do that when for exemple you noticed you did something she didnt like, you may say - does it make you feel a little upset? again, you may ask this question 1000 times before she will actually answer yes. that's all i can think of right now. my answer is only valid if your daughter was diagnosed by a professional."

When the dust settled and I was able to reflect, it hit me very hard mentally. Some of the things that helped were therapy, meds, continuously making a purpose for myself, getting engaged with a hobby or distracting activity among other things and reminding myself as much as possible that those thoughts in my head are only thoughts, sometimes t

Eveything came back normal and they said it was a flu like virus. I was prescribed a med for anxiety attacks as needed. It has helped some, but isn't fixing my problems. I never had any mental health issues in the past. Then went to a Psychatric Center for a mental health assessment. They weren't exactly sure what's going on with me. They said it could be stress and referred me to other mental health places. I looked into the places they recommend and they have horrible reviews. I'm keeping myself busy everyday with hobbies, excercise, work, etc. I still don't feel like myself yet. I have some up times, but still struggle with anxiety. I think maybe not feeling right might be making me feel down."

You're saying you were seeing this guy for 4 years? That is going to be tough to get over. As has been asked, are you seeing a therapist? Is someone helping you with your OCD? For him to have replied to your correspondence in such a hard manner at such a hurtful time of your life, seems to indicate that somebody hurt him real bad, and he's now trying to lash back at somebody else. But for you to have dated him for 4 years, there must have been something there. Did you notice anything during your relationship about his behavior? Is this disrespect a pattern of his? He could come flying back to you when his present girlfriend dumps him. As the song says: ""One fine day, you're gonna miss me, And a, one find day, you'll wanna kiss me, And a, one fine day, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.""

soon and that will help you forget this person. There's also the song: ""Got along without you before I met you, gonna get along without you now.

175980466,"I had like 6 apts at a dentist that took my Medicaid. It was zero cost to me and she fixed all my cavities, I had like 15 cavities I had gone to a dentist before her but he refused to help me saying he wouldn't get reimbursed enough from Medicaid for all the work he'd have to do on my teeth The dentist that did graciously help me told me that my medications cause dry mouth and that long term dry mouth can cause a lot of cavities"
175980467,"I think what I do is more result than a cause, but maybe I'm looking at it wrongly. In any event im a total PC guy, I basically live in front of my PC. At the moment, except for the usual chatting with people I have been online with for ages, checking news etc I'm either producing music or programming. In the evening at the moment I'm playing BF5. Im also a total Anime fan so im watching a lot of the current season anime. As to what causes me to cultivate it, I think that sounds to me a bit like its a conscious thing. I think its mostly unconscious and I guess its a result of a lot of stuff. One part of it is the schizoid / dissociative nature of my mind, where a lot of the natural aliveness is simply somehow split off. Then there is a negativistic outlook/schema where I think everything will ""end in tears"" anyways, so doing anything doesnt make a lot of sense. The latter has started changing due to therapy though and is not as extreme as it was a few years ago. Then I actually have been relative
ly deep into Buddhism a longer while ago and some of the tenets still linger on, because they resonated quite well with my outlook on life as being full of suffering, or about everyone and everything as being basically empty machines. Another cause is o course also my childhood, where I've been brought up by a rather absent grandmother who couldnt deal with at least 50 percent of human emotions, so I kinda just withdrew into my head and kind of stopped expecting good stuff to happen."
175980468,"_NAME_, & _NAME_ Thank you, for your insight. I had been on Citalopram (20mg) for about 12 years, had a setback and went to 40mg. Was good for several years and decided to cut back ( Dr's) permission. I went into a colitis flare and the anxiety came back that I went to full dose of 40mg, and full dose of Asacol. At this time during the Pandemic, I cannot see a physiologist in person, and the trauma I am dealing with I could only discuss one on one. I think I will try and download some excerises, or purchase books on self. I've been blaming myself for not recognizing my child needed professional help as a child, now the whole family is torn up. It's too much to handle at the moment, but i am trying to get better for the sake of the family."
175980469,"The interview went fine, it was just basically filling out some paperwork/updating it. They had me set up in a room with a lady video chatting on the ipad/guiding me through it.

I wanted to call into work today and take a mental health day but I didn't because the other two people who answer the phones are off due to furloughs and that would make it hard on the people who are here.

175980473,"Have you guys tried NAC? It's very effective for skin picking and trich. You can research the studies, they are pretty remarkable. It's over the counter. N-acetyl cysteine or NAC. Cysteine boosts our body's ability to produce glutathione. It's the body's main natural antioxidant. The quickest way to boost it is with NAC or Whey Protein Isolate. Anyways, you can do the research but it works for a lot of people, it may not work for everyone but it's worth a try. And as an added bonus it's a great way to fight off or reduce symptoms of COVID too! :o) If it makes you feel any better, NAC is actually found in the physicians desk reference and is used by doctors to detox the liver in emergencies when people overdose on tylenol. Just be careful with dosage, start low and gradually work up if needed. ...and give it several weeks to work. Best to you all!Post Edited (_USER_ID_) : 6/8/2020 10:22:39 PM (GMT-6) 12"
175980474,"First day on my lower dose of 1.5mg of VRAYLAR. I feel great, just fine, and not tired. But not manic either. Not depressed. This is how it was before with it. It balanced me in the middle. I’m watching unexpected. It’s like teen mom but a new series. Exactly like teen mom. I reallly think I could care for a baby. With as much energy I have on the right meds/dosage. I can do a lot of stuff. I’m extremely caring person naturally. It’s hard to pry me from the people I love. That’s why I was with my ex’s for so long. Would’ve been with them longer if they hadn’t pushed me away. Was with my high school bf for 6 years and then he just disappeared. He had bpd tho. Like he literally fell off the planet. Never heard from him again. _NAME_ acted that way too sometimes. I think I’d be a good mom. Since fiance is feeling a bit better we are having fun today.

175980480,"Hi there. I have heard your words and I am sorry for all the traumas you are going through. Let's break things: you are not functioning well and you also have a panic attack and you are in the fear because you think you will lost the job and you are feeling devastated because of the loss of your father. looking at your case, it seems like there is a connection between panicking, and fear of losing job. U know you are a smart and good worker. Do not fear of losing job. I know you lost your significant one but know that your father do not want to see you in that devastating condition. if he was alive he would wanna see you successful and happy. have a self positive talk. know his soul will be happy if you try to be a better person. once you accept this your panicness will do down and therefore you will not fear of losing the job. everything will be fine."

174375584,"He was a REALLY good psychiatrist. Asked all the right questions and listened to me and my mom. Best psychiatrist I've ever met. He was conservative and seemed really smart cuz he could keep track of my complete mess - He looked up everything that I've been prescribed in my life and we discussed a lot and talked for over an hour. He decreased the Vyvanse back to 40mg (Because changing it to 50mg is when I started to get bad symptoms - I think it's dopamine depletion) but he told me to take it at 10am instead of 8am in the morning and said if I still get dp/dr when it wears off, he can add a short acting stimulant in the evening. He increased the olanzepine to 10mg at night - So I'll have a really good sleep tonight with the zopiclone too (He didn't change that). I told him about my drug use and shroom overdose etc.. He said that my uncertainty and fear of my mom dying and me dying is excessive - Like my mom said. The fear of my dad being in on a conspiracy with everyone out to get me is just though
ts - Same with my suicidal thoughts - Just a coping mechanism. I'm staying in the hospital for now so they make sure that I take my meds as prescribed. I put them in my signature as a verification to myself and so people can help me. He mentioned that being on the Invega injection and Clozapine would be all I need (But I said that I would be way too tired and gain a bunch of weight - Although he said that it depends on the dose). We're keeping clozapine in mind.. He wanted to confirm my diagnosis short term and long term and said that my symptoms are likely schizophrenia/psychosis. So all's good. I'm gonna watch _NAME_ talks and hopefully not have a panic attack with the prescribed alprazolam.. Side note: It's all quite ****_NAME_ up and I want this to stop lol"
175980484,I took 1.5mg xanax last night and I couldn't feel music! It was horrible! But I knew it would only last for the night.. I hate benzos. They're like friendly antipsychotics.

175980492,"Well first and foremost, your mental health needs to come first. If it’s too much to be around your twin and nephew, then you don’t have to. Remember that you don’t have an obligation to your twin or your nephew. If you feel that this is something you want to do and have the capacity to do, then you need to set boundaries. Write down what triggers you and talk to your sister about it. It seems that neither you or your twin have had boundaries in your family relationships, but now that you’re adults you need them. If she refuses to abide by your boundaries, then it isn’t worth it. That isn’t the answer you want but it’s true."

175980508,"It's like I don't like going to the dentist so much, I try to make sure I don't have any cavities. It's not that I don't like going to the dentist, it's that I can't. In that, with my sensitive ears to noise, the loud steel dentist drill on the hard tooth is only 1-inch from my ear drum, one of the loudest sounds you can imagine. So, I can't get a cavity or they'll have to pull a tooth out. So I reverse engineer it. That is, I don't get any cavities. Hello!!!! I haven't had a cavity in 15 or more years. How do I do that? I don't eat any sugar, which started with a 2nd health condition I have or, sensitive ears to noise, in which, sugar doesn't help that, so I stoppled eating sugar for that reason. So that might be called half the battle. When sugar hurts your health, you'll stop eating sugar, hopefully. I don't eat desserts, sugared-drinks, candy or sweets of any kind. (There's some sugar in canned foods, but i try to rinse it out with water.) I drink a non-sugared drink, it's called water. Whoa, h
ow tough is that? OK, after my meals, I brush my teeth. Very tough. i also rinse very vigorously, meaning squishing the water between my teeth for 5 or 10 seconds to wash out any small items between my teeth. I then floss, to knock out any food particles between my teeth. I then rinse with Listerine Total Care which can kill the germs that cause cavities. Brushing or flossing does not kill germs that are on or between you teeth. And that's where cavities form, between two teeth. Listerine Total Care gets between the teeth and kills germs that cause cavities. Sometimes at night when I'm lying in bed, I'll feel a tingling between two teeth. I know what that is. It's a pre-cavity starting to form. I very often get up right then, floss between the affected area(s), gargle with Listerine Total Care, and the tingling stops. I know what's just happened: the Listerine (and floss) killed the germs that caused the pre-cavity. It's like a miracle. If an hour or two later or the next day the tingling is still there, I re
apply that. It's that or have my teeth pulled, what do you think I'm going to do? (Sometimes I don't floss (or use Listerine) after every meal, but I do rinse with water thoroughly for 5 or 10 seconds. Sometimes I even wait for a tingling between teeth, which might not be a good idea.)"

It is weird...and sad...I am a danger to the society in which I have never fit anyhow and nobody wants to be around a serial arsonist. I got caught for 3 of my fires, but there had been so many more that they don't know about (but harmless -- just boxes and papers and junk I'd found along the railroad tracks)...and I have done prison time (one year) for arson-2nd Degree. So I am here for you. Send me a message ANY time ok? _EMAIL_ is my email and I check it almost obsessively during the day. I am afraid for myself right now because I haven't been able to burn a damn thing in 4 months.

175980520,"I am not autistic, yet I notice patterns such as these as well. I see numbers in sounds, especially music but in people's voices also. Numbers talk to me but it seems they do not talk to other people. I do not know why this happens but I enjoy things like music as much as I enjoy mathematics, I remember when I started playing the piano ... somehow I understood it all without being taught. It was weird, I looked at the music and started playing it but I had never played before. Certainly was never taught music theory of any kind. Yet it was there in my mind, as if it had always been there. Bizarre. I also can randomly speak languages that I do not consciously know. I am not a demon, lol ... sorry if that news disappoints anyone. This is weird **** though, could never quite explain it and no one else could ... the only explanation offered for these oddities has been my IQ, pfft. I am rambling a bit ... apologies ... The ability to see patterns in the proper context is what is behind many of the scien

My pharmacy didn’t have exactly what the doctor requested so I had to have it transferred over to another pharmacy because I wanted it ASAP so after like an hour wait I got it and now I’m going to try to sleep.

175980534,"Yes, firemonkey. I am on 3 AP’s for the last 8 years and doing very well on them.

I hope she’s more open to it than my last two doctors were."
175980535,"Don't make me come up there. You said, ""Really?? I thought muscle pain cold helps ?"" Are you still breathing? A cold pack on chest pain? My chiropractor told me concerning my bad lower back, I have an extra vertebrae, and it slips out every now and cause me pain and he pops it back in. So he told me, in between visits, to alternate heat and cold on that or most any injured area (not the chest, I would think). So when my back is hurting, I put my heating pad on it and it increases blood flow (more oxygen and nutrients) to the injured area. Moist heat, wringing out a small towel for instance, might work even better, but the towel can't be dripping wet. This for about 10-15 minutes. On my same hurt back, or most other injured areas, after waiting some 10-15 minutes, I can apply a cold pack to the same injured area. This helps to shrink the inflammation. They sell cold pack granules at drug stores that conform to your back, arm, etc., and they stay in the freezer. Might buy two so one can still be in 
the freezer."

Getting on ABlifiy instead helped, but the bike is what keeps me back at my regular skinny weight of 185 or so. It took quite awhile, of course, but I try my best. But the Zyprexand and the Seroquel are what killed me weight-wise. Hugs!!!!!! Geodon and Abilify are the 2 I have heard most people say they have had best weight luck with. Hugs!!"

I don't think I have either. It's high blood pressure or something. I think it's because of lack of sleep from waking up early for work.. It could be from eating or drinking too much water. I'll pay more attention to it from now on and ask my doctor. It's terrible because I wanted to rest but these symptoms have to make me want to sit up all the time."
175980561,"I don't know if _PERSON_ was specifically researching synchronicity. He was mainly researching mental telepathy. Having subject guess the symbols on these Zener cards. He then analyzed the results after many trials and did a statistical analysis of that to come up with the odds against chance. Out of the 5 cards, random chance would be 20% for a correct guess. I think this is where _PERSON_ saw the connection with synchronicity. Most psychiatrist today believe that thing just happen randomly and there is no hidden meaning behind anything. Most think if you see special meaning in something, that is magical thinking and you need to be on medication. There are a lot of book on Synchronicity now and a lot of people think there is something to it. As far as questioning your beliefs when you mentioned working with a friend, here are 4 simple questions this author _NAME_ came up with. I just copied this off Wikipedia. I don't know if you could use it or not, but I thought I would paste it in here. Specifi
cally. The Work is a way of identifying and questioning any stressful thought. It consists of four questions and a turnaround. The four questions are:[8] Is it true? Can you absolutely know that it's true? How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought? Who would you be without the thought? The next step of The Work, the turnaround, is a way of experiencing the opposite of the believed thought. For example, the thought ""My husband should listen to me,"" can be turned around to ""I should listen to my husband,"" ""I should listen to myself,"" and ""My husband shouldn't listen to me.""[8] Then one finds specific examples of how each turnaround might be true."

175980566,"about the pinched nerve you say, ""I know I have a pinched nerve in my neck I’m working on getting fixed."" That's very good. You're taking care of yourself. From having a bad back and learning things from the chiropractor, he told me that a heating pad, alternating on the injured area for 15 minutes, some time in between with neither heat or ice applied (30 minutes?), then ice pack on the injured area. I used moist heat, which I find seems to go deeper into the injured area. Wet a small towel or the insert which comes with the pad, and wring it out. Then put the moist pad between the heating pad and the injured area. The heat increases the blood vessels, which bring more oxygen and nutrients to the injured area. The ice pack reduces the inflammation. It works very well on my back. (I also use both on my ears, because I have sensitive ears to noise. But both help calm my ears down.) The name of the ice pack, is the gel pack. For instance, when I used to use ice cubes in a container, they were roc
k hard, but that's all there was back then. This gel, it might look like soup at the store in its warm state, when frozen will better bend around the injured area, and apply more coldness to the skin. Sometimes I only put it on the injured area, like my lower back, for 30 seconds because it's so cold, then move it to another area of my back. It really helps reduce the inflammation and the pain. As far as the anxiety, are your seeing a psychiatrist? If you're taking Xanax, that's only a short- term tranquilizer. Is that from a general practitioner? I think a long term anti-anxiety would be better. Can you see a psychiatrist? As far as the concern, you said, ""I know I don't"" which is a big help. So, it's a big help, also, that you don't have the problem. Maybe that's how your stress is coming out. If you could relieve the stress, maybe you wouldn't have that. As for sleep, I take Melatonin from the health food store. The grocery or drug store health food section might have that. Or it can be ordered over the 
net. Or, the grocery stores that deliver might can deliver it to your house. They deliver every thing else. As for the Melatonin, I would get it in the 1 mg tablets, that way you can get the right dosage. I take 4, 1 mg, 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, which gives them time to take effect. You'll know when they start to take effect, you'll start getting sleepy. I then take 1 more right before I go to bed, to space them. If I wake up at 5 in the a.m. and I'm not sleepy, but have had only 4 or 5 hours of sleep, I can take another one, if I don't have to get up early. If I'm not taking psych medicine, Melatonin doesn't work. But as a bipolar, I take Mirtazapine anti-depressant and Lithium as a stabilizer, with the stabilizer keeping the anti-depressant from sending me into mania."

175980572,"Hi. I know how you feel. I have been stuck in a black hole for 3 years, but mine is bc I can't find mental health care that takes Medicaid. Is your boyfriend your daughters father? Are you in love with him or just with him bc you need him financially, physically, emotionally? The reason I ask is sometimes, the person we are with is not the person we should be with. We ""settle"" and than feel life is unfulfilling and that we failed, when the truth is, we become so stuck in the life we are in, that we give up trying to have the life we want. And we can have. If you are with your boyfriend because you can depend on him, he helps you with your daughter, you are afraid to make it on your own, or bc he is taking care of you and you are not in love with him, than it's not fair to you, your daughter or him. If you are in love with him, and he is in love with you, than you have a good foundation to start from. Once you are sure of your true feelings for him, than you can move on one way or another. Think o
f yourself as a beautiful butterfly who is stuck as a caterpillar in a cacoon. Why are you stuck? Is it bc the tree you are in is comfortable and you see no reason to change anything? Is it because if you become a butterfly, you will have to make it on your own and that scares you? Is it because you are afraid if you come out of your cacoon, you might fly into a window fan and get hurt and fail as a butterfly. Is it because you are afraid if you become a butterfly, you might not be able to fly, and then you can't fit back into the cacoon and you will be a caterpillar stuck in a butterflys body? These are metaphors, but you see where I am going? What is keeping you trapped in your cacoon? You have accomplished far more than you realize. And you have many gifts you may not even realize you have. Only you hold the answers. Once you answer why you can't seem to grow and blossom, than you can work on how to get where you want to be. Depression is a part of you like the color of your eyes. Don't push it away. Embra
ce it and use it in whatever you decide to do. There are so many people in this world that have depression and anxiety and panic attacks and refuse to admit it. So, they drink or do drugs to squash the feelings. But that doesn't work. Imagine if they could scream from the tallest mountain ""I'm depressed, anxious, and have panic attacks!! But I am going accept it, and try to make my dreams come true anyways!!"" People would look at them and say ""Good for you!! I'll be there if you need help on your bad days!!"" I did it. And it felt great! And I did things I never thought I could ever do. And you can too. Get into counseling if you can. And work thru this and stay busy. A little each day. Take a walk with your daughter, even if it's only half a block. And increase it a little more each day. Did you ever see the movie ""What about _NAME_?"" It's a comedy and kids can watch, but it has a message in it too. With Bill _NAME_ and _NAME_. Try to find it. You will love it. Good luck honey. You can get out of that c

175980584,"I have been experiencing mental health issues for about a year and a half now, a few months ago I got to an extreme low that finally pushed me to get help. I started my journey for help by seeing a counselor and after only two visits recommended me to see a psychiatrist, who immediately started me on mood stabilizers. It was a rough first couple of months with the dosage being increased first every 2 weeks, then every month, until finally last month we found a good dosage that helped me function the best. Since I started experiencing symptoms I have always hated the thought of being on a medication on a long-term basis and now that I am on medication I often wonder if they are actually beneficial for me. When I do forget a dose, the change in behavior is very noticeable, but yet I still hate the fact that this is my new normal. At times I can't help but hate myself for not being able to function properly, specifically my mind, and wonder if there will ever come a day when I won't need the medicatio
n anymore. Is this normal? For me to not want to be on medication even though I can see myself that it is helping?"

175980592,"Hi _PERSON_, I am sorry that you continue to have to deal with a person that has caused you so much pain in the past. I am glad you see that it is HIS deficit, and nothing to do with you personally that makes him act the way that he did toward you. For whatever reason your ex sounds like a man incapable of having a successful romantic relationship as made clear in not only his treatment of you, but from what you have heard about his past. I applaud you for getting out of the relationship when you did! From here on, you need only to have a business type of relationship. Co-parenting can be very personal, with the two parents working together closely as partners...but in situations where an ex is toxic, it is perfectly alright to keep your interactions with him brief and strictly matter of fact. Someone can only hurt/belittle/abuse you with your permission. Don't allow him any more power over you than he already has had in the past. No longer tell him anything of a personal nature, keep the small tal
k brief and general...and if he tries to say anything nasty to you shut it down. You could reply with, 'Do not continue to talk to me like that, I will not allow it any longer.' If he tries to persist, hang up, walk away, and basically disengage. Arguing or replying just gives him leverage to continue the harassment. It may take a few tries and some time to break the old patterns of how you interact. However, if you persist with the zero tolerance of disrespect, and set the boundaries for YOU to dictate how the relationship/interaction is going to go...he will eventually have no choice but to comply with YOUR rules. Don't view yourself as the victim....make yourself the boss! Best to you, and continue posting with us for support. _PERSON_ Cat"
175980593,"I was afraid this was coming, paying people based on their health. But now bonuses based on Body Mass Index (BMI) are here. Healthcare costs companies a fortune. 35% of employee compensation is in benefits, and the largest share of that is health insurance. Of course, companies seek to decrease these costs. Annual biometric screenings, a measure of health data collected for each insured person, have become commonplace. Blood tests, health questionnaires and body weight go into a database to be used, say the companies and insurance companies, to recommend ways a person can improve their health. But it’s not a big leap to see the employers and insurance companies using this data to maximize profits by trying to minimize healthcare costs by favoring workers they perceive to be healthier. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/older-bipolar/2019/08/overweight-people-to-be-paid-less/"

175980643,"super20dan said... Xanax should NEVER be used for sleep. fastest way to become addicted. same for klonipin. Z class of drugs can become addictive as well to include Ambien. It would be nice if nobody ever needed benzos and doctors were more knowledgeable and compassionate regarding the prescription and withdrawal effects. Sadly most are not aware or don't care. I was prescribed ativan and like another poster was having inter dose withdrawal symptoms. I found a very nice compassionate doctor and was able to start a taper process. Anyone who is on benzos and wants to reduce or get off try to find a good physcian or psychaitrist. You will most likely have to switch from a fast acting benzo to a slower acting one like valium. Valium can stay in the system for 200 hours as opposed to the half life of ativan and xanax. Once you are stable on the longer lasting benzo you can start a tapering process. The _NAME_ manual was created by a British doctor who noticed all the issues that came when people quit be
nzos cold turkey or were lowering their dose faster than they needed. Some of her initial information is great and some has been improved. There are many forums that are dedicated to benzo taper and withdrawal. It is a double edged sword as you will find lots of nice helpful people and situations similar to your own. You will also read lots of horror stories, symptom lists and encounter a few who let benzos withdrawal define them and they get off on the suffering. So take things with a grain of salt. I hope this information helps someone."

I called the other doctor in town (I live in a very rural area) and they are making me send over my medical history before I can make an appointment.

175980668,"Psychiatric medications have come a long way over the years. However, like all pills, psychiatric meds have their trade-offs. They all come with the possibility of unpleasant side effects. That's a big reason why some people with serious forms of mental illness elect to seek professional treatment with psychotherapy without trying medication(s). So is it possible to overcome moderate to severe anxieties, depression, bipolar disorder, and other forms of mental illness with psychotherapy alone...therapy without medication? Maybe. But I wouldn't try it. The thing is, if someone has mental illness, they need to get mentally healthy as quickly as possible. And psychotherapy is a slow process. Also, talk therapy has only limited success. Therefore, I think it's a bad idea to try to overcome serious forms of mental illness with psychotherapy without medication(s)."

175980684,"Thanks for your reply We took her to an in patient program at one point. She spent a week at a facility. But for the last few years I haven't had consistent insurance coverage for mental health coverage, and we can't afford to send her to the doctors she needs all the time. Right now I have no coverage at all - not even counselor. She has prescript ions that we pay for with cash (thank god we have a friend who works at a pharmacy!) but being bipolar, she doesn't take them regularly. She does self medicates with marijuana consistently, and that helps most of the time, but she has so many co-morbid conditions - PTSD, sexual assault from the past, anxiety, agoraphobia, seizures, etc - that Marijuana isn't enough sometimes. If I called her up today and told her we are short on money this week because of bills, for example, she would probably get triggered for the rest of the day and self harm. Her triggers are very sensitive, and that's with all of her medications and marijuana being taken. I love her 
dearly and when she is in a good mood, she's my favorite person in the world. But when she's in a bad mood, I just don't know how I can handle it long term. At this point the only question I really need answered is **how do I respond to self harming behavior**. I have been told that I should just let it happen because it will happen anyway when I'm not there to stop it. If I were to wrestle her to the ground, for example, to keep her from attacking herself, she lashes out and says she will call the police and have me arrested, sue me for divorce, etc etc (you know the drill). If I let her do it, she sometimes hurts herself badly. One time, for example, she punched herself in the head to hard that she blacked out. Am I just supposed to let it happen, since it's her way of blowing off steam? I told her she can even hit me instead of herself because I can take it better, but I feel that it's just transferring one bad behavior into another.

It is initially easy to feel confused, until we realize that, naturally, each of us is interested only in certain specific 'hats'. Yes, very much so, because it's true. Having been raised for the most part almost diametrically opposed to wisely, I was an impostor for a LONG time. It has taken my whole life so far, and great cost to me and everyone who had to deal with me , for me--one person--to even begin to be genuine, and then only in lucid moments. To some extent, yes, to ""fake it"" in order to survive and have the opportunity wise up (it's an endless process the outcome of which is never a given). No one gets out of here alive, and if we lack the courage to meet and to battle consistently and relentlessly with our most shameful flaws and to free our deepest selves , we will not die satisfied. Code: Select all Regardless of how socially popular we appear, regardless of how good-looking 
we appear and how numerous our sexual conquests, regardless of our income, of our credentials, of our assets, of our job title, of the size of our office, of our community standing, of our celebrity, of our power of life and death over thousands, even millions.

And, if we cannot do that, not much else matters. https://i.imgur.com/VCFNPW7.gif source: https://allpoetry.com/The-Man-in-the-Glass Often, 'an obvious security hole', is a trap While I don't believe emotions are necessary to experience the most important thing in life, I do think a conscience is. Those who maybe lack what's called a conscience, who maybe are born with an inability to feel responsibility, may very well get through this round of the polishing drum called Life unscathed, unaffected, unpolished, un changed , and unimproved . Such people (some believe Bill _NAME_ may be one), such 'winners' on paper, will have experienced a life analogous to endless, meaningless toilet paper y
ardage. Although, maybe even a conscience isn't necessary. It is the stuff that harms our egos and ONLY that stuff that transforms us for the better, and if we lack the ability to respond bravely to harsh Reality, we will miss entirely the purpose of existence.

175980729,"I have to tell you what happened today. First, a little history. I had a break about a month ago and thought the neighbor upstairs was plotting and making obnoxious noises. I heard two people, a man and a woman, upstairs OK? Well at the apex of the break I ""talked"" to my neighbors through the ceiling. Kinda let a lot of things off my chest. A month goes by I'm getting better and I decide to write a letter of apology to my neighbors for the unkind things I had unleashed on them. I left the letter and a gift from Amazon at their door. BTW the gift was a crock pot....who wouldn't want one of those Afternoon of the same day I hear a hard knock on my door and answer it. A big fellow holding the box with crock pot and my opened letter says it must be a mistake...the letter didn't make sense. When I asked him about the woman upstairs he said he didn't have a girlfriend. It dawned on me that it was all a big psychotic SNAFU. I had had auditory hallucinations for months which had a man and woman as the pl
ayers. So the crackpot downstairs is giving the crockpot to her brother. I feel better....."
174375896,"Hello all, I know this is a small subset of the forum and in my last post I already mentioned that I haven't been here in a while. I guess I just have had some things on my mind that I wanted to share some how and it makes me feel somewhat emotionally alleviated if I post here. I have really been struggling a lot lately with constant voices and coded messages to the point where it is disrupting my daily life. I deal with this on a regular basis, but normally I am able to muster the energy it takes to ignore the noise and chaos in my mind and do what I need to do to live. I guess the reason I wanted to post here is because every so often, I feel like I get the message from people that they think I am somehow lesser of a person or stupid because I say I am lonely and don't have friends in real life and I often find support from people on the Internet, most of whom I've not actually met and can't verify if they're who they say they are. I follow some other schizo communities and sometimes I hear comme
nts that schizo people should just ""get out there and be more social."" I know that that is probably in frustration to seeing those with mental illness struggle with isolation and depression. However, it frustrates me because it's really ignorant. The thing about socialization in the real world is that it takes time, energy, and effort, for the normal, average person. Some schizo people might have a lot of time, if they are on disability or don't have to work. For me, I am already at a disadvantage because so much of my energy is spent on my regular day-to-day duties like caring for my children and home and working part time. But in addition to that, I think that people don't understand how exhausting social interaction can be when you are constantly fighting to ignore or silence voices in your head, or feeling paranoid and seeing signs and codes and threatening messages everywhere. The truth is, first, it can be hard to even find friends as a normal adult. Second, most normal adults are either scared/unsett
led by psychosis, or they don't understand how to talk to someone who is struggling with it so it makes them uncomfortable. So I don't normally even disclose my mental health issues to people who are new friends, because I don't want to scare or burden them. For me personally, it is extremely difficult to be in an environment where there are several conversations going on at once or there is a lot of fast verbal ""back and forth"" and noise. It makes my wires feel crossed and it agitates me to the point where I start feeling violent and want to lash out at people. I try to avoid this situation at all costs because I have learned to manage myself and I want to be a good friend, coworker, parent, etc. The reasons why it's often just not possible to say, ""hey cool, i'll get off the Internet and go make friends"" as a schizo person is because every time I go out to do something fun that regular people do, I risk the chances of putting myself in a situation where I cannot control what is happening and I needlessl
y make a scene, embarrass others, or have to rely on others or end up in a costly hospital stay. Or, I risk the chance that it takes so much energy to engage in social interaction that I don't have enough left over to care for myself properly and make sure my bills are paid and my family is fed. Additionally, with mental illness, there are so many times that you cannot predict whether you will be capable of doing something that you promised to do. I know that depression can literally make my body feel achy and weak, or that my mental illness takes such a toll on my physical state that I have to lay in bed and just watch Youtube or sleep for hours to recover enough to manage getting out of bed. There have been times that I volunteered to work with nonprofits or community groups and was really excited to help, and had to cancel because I just did not have the capabilities at the time of the event. It was sad and frustrating and embarrassing for me, but because of situations like that, I have learned to be reall
y cautious. When I see others having fun, I often feel lonely and I wish that I could just be outgoing and make a bunch of friends and go do things together. But the reality is that, in terms of what is socially expected of a friend, I would make a really terrible one because I cannot be relied upon or dependable. I don't have any control over times that I am just not able to keep appointments I have set. For these reasons, online mental health communities are really beneficial. There are other reasons, as well. For instance, regular friends shouldn't be relied upon constantly to be your only source of support, or they will burn out. That is not fair to do to any one person. If you make friends with a lot of people online who understand, generally, mental illness, then you can rely on several people, and you can also provide support for them in return when they need it. Not only that, but many times, I might need to talk to someone at really weird hours in the middle of the night, and it would be rude to regu
larly call an IRL friend for that kind of thing. Additionally, sometimes staying distracted can help and posting on forums or chatting with others can take your mind off of voices and things that are bothering you, without just sitting in a room alone and going insane. But if you are really tired, or if something is triggering you, you also have the option to shut the computer and sleep or go for a walk, and care for yourself in the best way that you can without offending people. Obviously if I invite a friend over for the afternoon, I can't just disappear to practice self care. The threats of being homeless, being destitute, losing loved ones, or ending your own life can all be very real and very scary threats that those of us with mental illness face on a regular basis. I know that a lot of people think getting support or making friends online is stupid, but for me it has probably many times been the difference between staying alive or committing suicide. I do still feel very lonely, and I do still long for 
real life relationships and activities. But I am really thankful for the connections I have with strangers from other places, because it has allowed me to cope."
175980730,"I went to the bar to have a few drinks. My waiter actually bought a beer for me, that's the 3rd time that has happened at this place. I truly don't understand why they treat me so nicely there. I stay there for 3-4 hours and tip 50% but that's no reason to buy me a drink. They need to save that money for college, seriously. I feel so bad for millennials and younger generations. They are getting screwed by stagnant wages over the past, I thought it was the past 10 years, but it's been the past 20 years. What else I did today: Went to the grocery store Paid my T Mobile bill Went to GNC to get protein powder Went to the pharmacy Then I got pizza I did all of this to prepare for rush, the two week period when university students move out and then new students move in. I have to make sure houses and apartments are painted, all drywall finished. I got this."

175980733,"I think I gotta tell T on Saturday that I'm stuck. I'm stuck and I'm tired of pushing through which is what it feels like I'm doing and I just want to disengage from everything and everyone and go back to bad coping mechanisms. I feel like I'm going to relapse or fall apart or maybe both. This is bad timing as my parents are going away this weekend. I need to keep it together this weekend. But I'm exhausted to the bone of just pushing through. I need someone to carry me for a while. I feel like my nephew must have felt like after a long day at Disneyland where he sat his butt down on the ground and did not want to move. I couldn't carry him because we already had his little brother to carry and the packages and everyone's stuff so he had to walk. I was like, ""Honey, I'm so sorry but you have to get up and walk to the tram. You have to. I can't carry you."" But when we drove home I carried him from the car to the bed because he was just done. That's how I am: done. Except it hasn't been a fun old d
ay at Disneyland. I know I need to text my support people but I'm tired of doing that too. I just want to **** up. And then have to deal with the fall out even if it means hospitalization. But I know that's just part of me talking because I really don't want to be hospitalized so I have to have to have to pull it together. **** it!"

That's what ketamine did for me. It dissociated me away from my thoughts and this can be obtained through meditation. With psychosis, I feel like thoughts are too closely identified with the self - Especially with depersonalization. That's just my take on it.. Antipsychotics prevent me from having positive symptom thoughts - They're gone now.. I feel pretty good. I'm going on a hike today ^-; My mom woke me up early after I took the Vyvanse which didn't wake me up. She made me a coffee and I was pretty sure that I wouldn't wake up but I'm wide awake now.

I always wake up and go to sleep feeling completely useless as if I have no place in this world. My mind is always awake trying to figure out what it is I could do to stop feeling this way. It feels as if I’m alone in this and no one around me understands. I was depressed before but now I feel as if I’m in my worst. As if I’m already dead inside. I’ve seen therapists but it’s always the same, I don’t see a change in me. I get easily triggered being around lots of people and start to panic, I’m always crying when I’m alone and it’ll be for no reason. I just want to look for answers or talk to someone that could help me"

175980770,one of my voices wants me to hurt myself. it's relentless. I got a little mixed up on my medicine and I thought i got it straightened out. Then I went out to dinner last night and forgot to take the medicine with me (it's supposed to be taken at night with food) so I took it when I came home. I don't know if this suffering is self inflicted because I messed up on my medication. Argh. I'm frustrated with myself because I am not doing it purposefully. I even asked my Dad to help me with my medication. I want to cry but I can't cry.
175980771,I ate some grocery store pizza (oven baked) and 15-20 min later I felt really depressed about my dad. It made me think back to those studies that showed that high carb diets are linked to depression. Idk why I got depressed. Just came on all of a sudden or so.

175980799,"I have been working on systematic oppression for the last twenty years beginning with Re-Evaluation Counseling (RC) but the current pandemic, coupled with protests and riots has made race relations very troubling for me. I have to risk that conversations may get messy and new ideas may need to be defended. I hate confrontation so having a white gay man acknowledge his privilege to me isn’t useful. Witnessing white people protest that Black Lives Matter (BLM) is negatively restimulating. I fear crowds of any kind so I’m unwilling to participate. However, acknowledging people taking a stand for others is encouraging. I am encouraged by the news reports of ending unlawful police practices. A friend said it best, everyone that wears the uniform isn’t bad; some officer become bad over time but it’s rooted in fear, insecurity and trauma. I was a law enforcement officer in the late 1990’s for six years. Mental health oppression is real. I started weekly counseling with a female therapist. I pray

Perhaps this is just my philosophical perspective, but I find that remembering that sometimes humans have nothing to do has helped me when I'm bored.

Is this really all medicine related? Ugh I wonder if I have a physical condition going on. This makes no sense. At all. When I was working and making myself get up in the morning, I was so incredibly tired most days. Or at least half the days. But I still stayed up, even after work, and my sleep schedule was on point. I slept every night. So I feel perhaps maybe some has so to do with me not being as active in doing things during the day, but there’s gotta be more to it. I’ve been dealing with excessive sleepiness since I been on AP’s starting with seroquel or haldol, one, back in 2007. Whichever I was on first. I don’t remember. Before that, I was in high school and still on meds but not AP’s. Just AD’s and AA’s. So I was still sleepy but that also could’ve been teen issues cuz I was staying up into the night, etc and school 
is exhausting of course on top of that. I literally don’t know what’s wrong anymore. Idk if it’s the meds anymore FULLY or idfk. It’s driving me insane for a straight decade now. Fckkk."

175980811,"It is possible your anxiety episodes are a result of thought patterns that are being triggered. You might have to see a therapist to determine what are the triggers that start those thought patterns. If you are not wanting to go that route just yet, maybe find self help or psychology books that are specific to anxiety triggers. If reading is not your thing, try yoga, meditation, and/or mindfulness techniques to see if one can calm your mind. Aging and death is a natural process in life. Those are two things every human being share in common. It is also two things that humans cannot control. Most people with anxiety problems are related to things that they cannot control(other people's actions, aging, death, etc). I see a connection with your isolation(few friends and family in your support circle) with your desire to have children. This obviously would give your life more purpose and fill your support circle with more members. But the average age of women who have children for the first time is alm
ost 30. From my perspective, you have time to wait. I hope you can find some internal peace and continue to grow as a young woman."

175980865,"Thanks, I genuinely mean that as usually, I don't take these comments too literally, to be honest, it's my insight with toughing out all the 'voices' and mind games that are displayed in front of me upon a daily basis that gives me a sort of edge to studying just what this thing is, if I was heavy medicated I would not be able to see or understand things like NLP, Cyber Abuses, Mobbing,Molka and to tell if something is a modern form of deception aiming at baker acting someone through the use of gaslighting mind games. I would not have drawn comparison to the experiences of hearing voices as a form of live streaming 24/7 and understood what subvocalization is with regards to it. It would not be a hidden abuse or form of Zersetzung aimed towards marginalizing members of the community, as I tried to highlight that there is no anti-abuse any anti-harassment treatment there is no anti-hate medication so what would be the logic in taking any! It would be like saying your Bio-Polar because you've been Dox

175980872,"It is tough to feel like you do. You do deserve to feel loved. This may not apply to your situation, but may give you pause for thought. Something I have learned over my 14 years of marriage is that how I show love is completely different to how my husband does. So there have often been times that I feel completely unloved and unappreciated even though he thought he was doing his best. I show love by doing - making favourite food, organising outings, surprise him with intimate times in places he doesn't expect. He thinks he is showing love because I never have to take out the trash, or worry about money. I want him to take me out to do something we both like - movies, dinner, hiking with me and he wants more 'one on one' if you get my drift! So neither of us feels loved even though we think we are showing it. Talking is the only way to figure it out, all the best!"

175980890,"By typing into the search engine in the opening page of the browser, ""antidepressants that don't cause lowering of sex drive"" you can see these same results in the opening 8 or 10 topics that come up. I think, too, there are other factors which need to be considered by you and your doctor. What I found was, that the antidepressant Bupropion, sometimes known by its brand name, Wellbutrin, came out at the top in every study. I even anticipated the next problem of weight gain from various such medications, but it said about Bupropion (Wellbutrin) one of the side effects was: weight loss. First, webmd.com cautioned, ""Treat the Depression First"" in that ""Whatever is happening with your sex life, it's important to treat depression first. Address any sexual side effects later."" *One website, in an article written by _NAME_ Block at www.jennyonthepage.com said “In fact, antidepressants in the SSRI family (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are known to cause low libido. Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa 
and Paxil are all SSRIs and all have been documented as having sexual side effects.” “Changing to Wellbutrin (another antidepressant that works only on dopamine and norepinephrine receptors) or adding it to an SSRI can help counteract sexual side effects,” he said. “Wellbutrin has been shown to have no sexual side effects due to its mechanism of action,” Collom said. In fact, “Wellbutrin can actually increase one’s sex drive.” *www.verywellmind.com suggested 1. Take a Lower Dose and to 2. take the Pill After Sex. *Health.harvard.edu More sexual side effects: citalopram (Celexa); fluoxetine (Prozac); paroxetine (Paxil); sertraline (Zoloft) less sexual side effects: bupropion (Wellbutrin); duloxetine (Cymbalta); mirtazapine (Remeron) *psychcentral.com A 2001 study out of the University of _NAME_ said ""serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, such as Paxil or Zoloft) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, such as Effexor and Cymbalta) were associated with a higher rate of sexu
al dysfunction, other antidepressants were associated with significantly lower rates, namely bupropion (Wellbutrin) and nefazodone (Serzone)."" ""Wellbutrin, the brand name of bupropion, had the lowest overall rate of sexual dysfunction. It was associated with a rate of 22% of the overall population."" *psychologytoday.com Wellbutrin is just as effective as the most popular class of antidepressants, the SSRIs (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro, Luvox). Its nonsexual side effects are no worse, and it’s unlikely to cause sexual side effects *Livestrong.com Bupropion, sometimes known by its brand name, Wellbutrin, is an antidepressant...Side effects relating to sexual dysfunction do not occur; however, headaches, weight loss and nausea may be potential side effects that patients should be aware of when taking this medication. Mirtazapine is another kind of antidepressant medication...sexual side effects, such as a loss of libido, do not occur while taking this medication, but patients may feel dizzy, anxi
ous or confused. Somnolence, or excessive sleepiness, occurs in more than half of patients taking this medication. Venlafaxine is known as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor--While sexual dysfunction may occur, loss of libido is a rare side effect; according to the medical reference ""UpToDate,"" only about 5 percent of patients will experience this unpleasant effect."

175980897,"Hi. Along with OCD/anxiety issues, I also have reflux and swallowing problems due to Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EOE). I would definitely suggest speaking with your doctor if you continue to experience difficulty swallowing. It could be that you're refluxing which is causing inflammation in your throat. This exact symptom of difficulty swallowing was the reason I went to my doctor a few years back. I did not find out it was also related to having EOE until I had an endoscopy and biopsy which showed that eosinophils were the culprits. You might want to check out books or YouTube videos by two leading reflux experts, Drs. _NAME_ and _NAME_. They have some great advice and plans related to lowering reflux (which you may or may not have) caused by excess acid. You should also keep a food diary to see if any specific foods cause you to have swallowing difficulty. Good luck. I hope it all works out for you."

175980903,"Yes. And so often we pride ourselves on having figured another out; what makes them tick, where they are coming from. The truth is, one can NEVER know or fully understand another. It is impossible imo. It is better to focus on oneself and try and ease up on being judgmental and critical of others ( a natural human tendency). Not saying I can do it, but I am aware that by harshly judging others all the time feeds my misanthropic nature and is at the very least energy draining. Hah, this would be my argument for NOT listening to others esp. those who lack the ability to self reflect or view things as objectively as possible. Those who are too self critical come across as weak. Those who always feel they are 'right' are pains in the ass... so it is better not to think much about others at all. Especially in a working environment. I think, letting go of needing answers can be a relief."

175980942,"i'm with spikes with the love hate relationship with clozopine. the blood work is weekly for some time before it changes to bi weekly the lab has to forward the results to the pharmacy before it can be picked up for the week. I made it 6 months and was so over the med. it didn't work well for me although i was on a high dose. the accompanying slurring words and drooling was like thorazine and i felt so confused often. I went to the pdoc one day and said i won't take it anymore and that was that now i take Seroquel and Geodon and its better than nothing for me. i know clozopine helps lots of ppl if you are having psychosis and have never tried it , then talk to your doctor it might be the med for you, it just wasn't for me."

175980961,"i did shower this morning and washed my hair , dried and ironed it to look nice. i should shower more often."
175980962,I can't get motivated to do anything. My parents are telling me that's b.s. and I should just get to work and stuff. I can't believe this. I just cannot get motivated to do anything. It's a completely ridiculous problem to have. I talk to a therapist and take my meds and stuff and I still feel this way. I guess meds cannot just cause me to have motivation again. I need some sort of change but I don't know what it should be. I was also seriously considering leaving the country again and going back to Argentina last week. I am still considering it. I think I have reverse culture shock from when I lived in Argentina for a year or so.

He looked melted, like a candle. *8-foot tall malevolent nun. Very shadowy and dark even on a sunny day *A giant in the neighbor's backyard. Every once in a while it's just a regular person. I saw my friend on one occasion. Other than that it's just faceless random people that disappear when I look at them. For a long time I was stuck thinking of everyone around me as a potential threat in the same way a strange, nervous dog is a potential threat. They could be my best friend, or they could rip my throat out, and they could change their minds about it at any moment. Most importantly, they were animals, and ferally unpredictable."
175980965,"G'morning _PERSON_ and everyone. I'm doing bad. Having lots of sui thoughts. Went back and forth this weekend about going to the hospital or not. I ended up not going. I looked at the hospital's website where I would like to go if I have to go but they still don't allow visitors because of COVID and that's one thing that is making me definitely not want to go. But on the other hand I gotta keep myself safe. Don't know what the right answer is. HUGS All, _PERSON_"

They can appear suddenly and then just disappear. Try not to let the catastrophic thinking get a hold of you. Use your positive mantras and other coping skills to get you through until you can see your doctor. You have had similar worries about health issues in the past, that have turned out to be nothing. This is going to be the same I am sure. Let us know how you are doing soon, S.C."

I goto bed about 11pm but then I’ll wake up at 3am cuz I deal with insomnia my whole life. That’s usually how it is. That’s how it’s been all my life. Messed up sleep schedule since I was a kid.

175980983,"Hey there, I currently have a new symptom and am curious if people have experienced something similar. Lately, my head has been tingling in the way that it tingles when a movie or song moves you, or when you scratch an itch or clean your ears--it's not a painful feeling but it's as though my brain is over-firing. It lasts about three seconds and it keeps happening a couple times per hour and I'm not sure if I'm making it happen or it's happening on its own and it's something I need to get checked out. If I busy my mind (or take a Xanax), I think I feel it less. I am, of course, thinking the worst: early MS or epilepsy, a tumor, small seizures, etc. I know it's unlikely but alas. Full disclosure, I've had major health anxiety over this last year (from shortness of breath to heart palpitations, to brain fog, etc) and so I feel as though this is another way my brain is tricking me into thinking I have something more serious. It's so hard to tell because the symptoms are very real but whether or not it
's a sign of something serious, is hard to tell. To clarify, I don't have any other symptoms (no pain or double vision, no balance issues), just this head tingling. Any thoughts? Thanks"

174376258,"Well the plan is to eventually get onto Vraylar. I wish this weren't so difficult! On top of that I am constantly changing my mind about things. Like, my pdoc wanted me to try to phase out Abilify by using Vraylar to taper between the two, you know, and then I was just like, I can't do this. That was because I felt slightly uncomfortable with the change. I don't know what gets into me these days. It's really annoying because it goes against what my pdoc tells me to do. Then I just feel like a crazy person for not being able to follow his advice."

175980994,"I'm new here and really struggling. My 25 year-old severely bipolar daughter lives with me until she's approved for low-income housing in our community. I lost my job in May due to the pandemic, and haven't found anything yet, although I've been looking. Being isolated, and having to be at home almost all the time has exacerbated the tension between us. She's been lashing out at me - threatening to hurt me, threatening to hurt herself, and it's pushing me to my breaking point. Any concrete strategies or suggestions on how to defuse her when things get bad would be phenomenal."
175980995,"I don't suppose it has to. Or else the ""depression"" part of the name wouldn't be necessary. I think it's easy to understand why it can be linked though. If something has long been part of your understanding of yourself and the way you relate to the world around you, then once you realize you can't rely on that premise anymore (or realize you never should have), it's just like a literal depression in the ground beneath you. You can't just keep walking. Or worse, if it turns out to be a gaping hole under a house you've built or let someone build for yourself. It all comes crashing down, and you're homeless all of a sudden. Yes. Freedom isn't an inherently good thing though. More freedom entails more choice, and choice takes effort. There's a point where you get diminishing returns. The choice of limiting your choices is just as logical as it is inevitably arbitrary. Belief systems are one of the main ways how people limit their burden of choice. The main problem with it is that it's generally impos
ed more than it is voluntarily accepted. The chance of individual incompatibility is high. But then again, the option to freely choose what exact belief system you're bound by (or worse, a sense of urgency to choose it because you currently lack an effective one -- AKA: an existential crisis) is much more daunting than the everyday burdens that a belief system is supposed to relieve you from to begin with. And that's a big part of why people tend to cling to (seemingly obviously) questionable things right up until $#%^ has undeniably hit the fan. Of course you can. Fear doesn't arise out of deliberate contemplation or logical conclusions. It arises out of instinct."

Weed has never been a problem. I have too much anxiety and have tried everything...benzos (sometimes crushed and snorted), alcohol, meditation, self harm. Nothing works like weed. It comes on quickly, like alcohol, but alcohol (and benzos) only cover up the anxiety: you can still feel it squirming under your skin no matter how whacked you get. Weed distracts me from it. Now they're saying weed can cause schizophrenia. I don't see how that's possible. Psychosis maybe, but not full-blown schizophrenia."

As has been mentioned in the past, it normally really does take skills like a huge degree of adaptability, a capacity for psychological (or emotional) closeness, willingness, ability to trust to any real degree, etc. in order to have and maintain something complex. If those skills are unrealistic, then at least for the time being, one might as well focus on having a pet dog or God or whatever else improves quality of life."

175981037,"Thanks for your response, S. Cat. I will ask the doc about vistaril. I actually tried another first generation antihistamine, Doxylamine (which is OTC), as an alternative to the benzo, one night. I had used Doxylamine in the past, before I was on the Zoloft, on occasion, so I figured I would give it a try (and my doc said its OK to try it). It did put me to sleep but I was very drowsy the whole next day -- the so-called ""hangover effect."" Fortunately that was a Saturday, so did not interfere with work. But still.... Tonight I plan to experiment with half of a Doxylamine pill. I am thinking that might be enough to get me to sleep, but without the hangover effect the next day. In addition to the difficulty falling asleep, I have been waking up very early (515 am or so) and with an uncomfortable activated/agitated/jittery feeling. Last night I tried taking .5mg of the Klonopin rather than .25mg, and I slept better and had much less of the jittery feeling in the morning. (Not zero, but less). The doc 
has approved that dose. But again I am trying to limit my use of the benzo. Of course, none of this is a good long term solution. I need to be able to fall asleep without benzos or antihistimines or sleeping pills, and sleep through the night, and wake up without this very uncomfortable agitated feeling. Time will tell whether these Zoloft sleep-related side effects will dissipate with time, or not. I guess they usually do. But usually is not the same as always, so we will see... You also mentioned the possibility of increases in my Zoloft dose. That is not something I am going to be willing to do. It is true that many patients with OCD anxiety require a higher dose of Zoloft. (My doc put the odds that 50mg would be sufficient for me at around 50%). But I am just not willing to deal with the side effects of an increased dose. The cure can sometimes be worse than the disease. And I need to be able to function. So I will get whatever benefit I can get from the 50mg of Zoloft -- assuming I can resolve the sleep 
issues -- and then deal with the rest through the CBT/ERP I am doing."
175981038,Sounds awful.
175981039,"I had a volunteer job as a telephone counselor. I'd recovered from a few years of bad depression, and I felt obliged to do something for other depressed people. Don't ask me why I thought one-on-one counseling would be a suitable activity for me, but it ended up having a lot of benefits. The training is actually really good for learning how to talk to other people in all sorts of situations, and I could get out of Christmas, New Year etc. by scheduling shifts. It's the only time in my life I've had a cast-iron way to get out of social events where I actually got social credit for escaping. ""Hey, that's so generous of you to give up your Christmas."" Ha. Hardly anyone calls crisis lines in the middle of the day on public holidays. The peak comes afterwards, when people have spent the day lonely or arguing with family. So I could put my feet up in an soundproofed call room and read a book instead of having to go to a party. That's probably the most schizoid moment, but when I quit was typical too. I
t was one in the morning, and I was listening to someone who was really depressed. I realised that I was actively hoping that they'd turn out to be suicidal so I could call in a police intervention instead of having to listen to the details of their life for another ten minutes.

175981043,"So, the class I taught last night just didn't go well. I guess I felt like I was talking the whole time. Which isn't necessarily good if you're not giving a lecture. I guess I feel like that is somewhat contributing to wanting to go off of Zyprexa and Xanax. I don't know. It's weird. I don't know why I have these thoughts about going off of those meds even after I've kind of confirmed that they are working for me. Hmmm...."
174376335,You're not whining. These are hard things to deal with!
174376347,When I was on Geodon it took away my apatite and I lost like 17 pounds in like a month and a half while on it. I know Abilify is pretty weight natural as well. There are other options. I talked to my pdoc about my interest in CBD and because she's not up to day on research on CBD she claims it'll make my symptoms worse.
175981044,I never thought that girl would do that to me. I considered her my best friend. I guess I'm still hurt a bit.
175981045,"I just want to say a couple of things that helped me. I also used to say, why me, what did I ever do to deserve this kind of anxiety. One day it finally dawned on me, why not me. Every cancer patient says why me, every heart attack patient says why me, every person that can’t afford their rent says why me. There are millions of people in this world walking around saying why me. So, why me, because we are all human beings and we all have something bad Also, I kept wondering when my anxiety was finally going to be cured. The day I realized that anxiety is not cured but rather managed, it really helped me. And I work hard every day to manage it and I have more good days than bad days. Finally, I am a good bit older than you and have a daughter your age. If I found out she was suffering from anxiety without telling me I would be very upset. I want my children to let me help them with all their problems. That is what parents are for."

175981060,"You’ve been on Lexapro (net says for depression and anxiety) almost a month, isn’t that right? I think it says 6 to 8 weeks to take full effect. And your surgery was about two months ago. Glad you're trying to stay positive. It helps me a lot. Were you raised in a positive household? I did not know carbs were not good for gerd. I had mentioned I had diabetes and was supposed to eat less carbs (potatoes, rice, bread) which turn to sugar. You wondered about getting diabetes. That is the time to think about diabetes, before you get it. Net says to reduce chances of getting diabetes: 1. Cut Sugar and Refined Carbs From Your Diet. 2. Work Out Regularly. 3. Drink Water as Your Primary Beverage. 4. Lose Weight If You're Overweight or Obese. 5. Quit Smoking. 6. Follow a Very-Low-Carb Diet. 7. Watch Portion Sizes. 8. Avoid Sedentary Behaviors. Best foods are: Fruits (blackberries and strawberries are best for diabetics), vegetables, whole grain bread, brown rice, beans. Instead of refined carb white bre
ad, eat whole grain bread; instead of refined carb flavored yogurt, try natural yogurt; and instead of refined carb breakfast cereal, try oatmeal. Also watch what you buy at the super market, with canned food having the most salt, frozen much less, and fresh food the least of all. For instance, canned corned beef hash has has 980 mg. (40% daily value) of sodium, compared to 43 grams for frozen fish, and 70 mg of salt for fresh chicken, which is lower in cholesterol and fat. Canned lima beans have 300 mg. of salt, while frozen lima beans and broccoli have none (1% for broccoli). This website has a diabetes forum where the moderator, _NAME_, gives a lot of good information. By reading the questions and replies, you can get a lot of help, including how to reduce the chances of getting diabetes."

175981067,"I am kind of okay with having support for an experience of suffering, if that support is stoic and quiet rather than an incessant talker. When it comes to something awe inspiring, like stunning views, sunsets, great movie, being in nature; or something that triggers creative thinking, I prefer to be alone. Then, the presence of another, even someone quiet, can interfere with my introspective processes. I guess sharing suffering offers a distraction and dilutes the intensity of pain. Sharing something magical is a distraction that dilutes the intensity of joy."
175981068,Yes I did. It felt good.
174376366,"One take away to learn from this is that everyone's schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar, or depression, everyone's is different. They try to squeeze them in neat categories but life is way too complicated to be simply diagnosed into one category. When it comes to any kind o life, we always have to make qualifiers such as ""Generally"", ""for the most part"", ""by and large."" I apparently have schizoaffective, but I have no cognitive decline, and my doctors have noticed that and it makes them squint a bit."

175981076,"If your situation is one in which you need to remain living at home, I agree that your instinct to remove yourself from the situation is good. Without knowing very much about you or your neighborhood, I can only offer an anecdote. As I grew up in a small town and was dealing with anxiety and depression, I found that walking/jogging/running was a very good outlet for me. Not only did I have a legitimate excuse to escape the house, but the exercise invariably helped me with my headspace. There were many, many runs fueled by anger back then. If you’re in high school, I would really suggest joining a club or team - even if you’re not athletic. I know Covid throws a wrench in this, though. But trying to improve your situation is never pathetic. If you’re out of school, I agree that writing is good, but it is a solitary endeavor which will not help you to meet people. Community is pretty important. Is there a book club or writers’ group in your area you can join? Maybe there is a virtual group? I 
know that initiating these activities seems overwhelming… I’ve been there… but if you can get over that one “hump,” it’s worth it. Also, have you told your family how their fighting is affecting you? Do you feel safe doing so? Additionally, if they can’t love and accept you for who you are, your sexuality and identity are none of their business. Of course it is not “a choice.” Keep yourself safe - both physically and mentally. I do encourage you to reach out to a support group for this. There are several hotlines that can help! Although it may feel like it, you are not alone. You just haven't found your people yet. When you do find them, it's so worth it."

Rather I'm telling people that the interaction or the shadow of interaction of online video with peers is helping me.

He is depressed and has self hatred and feels judged if medical help is suggested. He has lost job and vehicle and is isolated and slipping farther away. What can I do. No insurance no income he’ll eventually lose his home. I am on social security and cannot keep trying to help him limp along. It’s killing me

You have to be at a certain place every time... just too much of a hassle, as much as I need it. I’d rather talk to my friends, like here. I’m starting to be unable to have time to do anything extra. By starting, I mean within the last couple of years or so. Compared to 5 years ago or so. It’s not that I technically don’t have time. It’s that I require so much time to recoup many times a day cuz my mental health. Which I need a nap or multiple quiet times. So I don’t technically have time to anything more or extra."

175981089,"I sometimes envy people who have so much confidence in themselves and have a great relationship between their families. I'm currently a college student in my 2nd to 3rd year intending to graduate in 2021, but I just feel so much anxiety about my future that is not driven by my own ambition in the slightest and only done by just out of spur. I currently still live with my family and I can say with confidence that I do not have a good relationship between my own family members that I am seen as the least intelligent due to my lack of experience. I've lived quite a sour life of thinking I have friends and that I'm socially healthy. But I realize more and more that I'm just lying to myself to ignore that I'm actually quite socially isolated even if I'm living with my family. I'm currently struggling with academic progression and being constantly pressured and blackmailed by my mother that I will be punished because I'm consistently lacking in academic performances and I personally am aware that I do no
t excel in academics and have been trying to muster confidence in myself. But with every occasion, I am pushed back down once more as I'm constantly reminded of my failures and I can't even express my own feelings without having my failures being used as an excuse to put me down more. They call it a reason to make me motivated because I am told they do not know what to do with me anymore and it's not like I would know either. I've only felt more guilt and uncertainty and anxiety when I am taking classes unsure if I'll even pass the class given how much pressure is placed upon me and that I'm only left with ""punishments"" and harsh words just waiting for me. I can understand that they wish to support me in some shape or form but I just cannot understand or feel any comfort or confidence from their choices of words. I can't even muster any confidence in the slightest to wonder if I've become bipolar or depressed but I just can not live a genuine life in the slightest. In every occasion I am brought down due to 
some reason that may displease my family, I just contemplate suicide and I have my mind in the gutter and I try my best to hide my own emotions because I just do not trust my own closest family in my own emotions and I feel like that's a big loss, and I can't even ask about visiting a specialist as I suspect that i'll be criticized once again by my mother of whom I'm thankful for but I just cannot trust her in a lot of aspects. I would love to have help before I find myself genuinely lost in my own life with a crisis."

I remember him saying normally if a person would describe their experience to a psychiatrist they maybe misdiagnosed as psychotic. I have experience both myself, and there are some similar characteristics in the hallucinations, but they are two different things. When they do happen they can be kind of frightening but just try and think to yourself ( well that was interesting ) I think it was _NAME_ that said, knowledge is the antidote for fear."

Idk anymore. Between the severe psychotic episode I encountered a week or so ago and this depression, I really, really want to give up on my life goals. Like I haven’t really been inspired, or writing, or reading, or anything. I’m pushing myself to post on social media.

Hugs and love!!!!"
175981112,My family got an order that kept me in health facility to get help. I would suggest looking into that for whatever state you live in. I believed my delusions sometimes but one of the delusions I had was that I didn't need help and that doctors didn't know what they were doing. I get a shot every month so I don't convince myself that I don't need it. It is the best solution and it saved my life.
175981113,"Not sure one is ever ready to deal with them. The main draw back of this is, it takes a few sessions. If one has a seemingly bad experience with lots of traumatic memories, that is supposedly good. With the right guide, one is then encouraged and supported during their next session to work through the trauma, by taking more. If I had money I would probably go through the lady associated with this website, in Peru. I like the honesty of this particular website where it also discusses those who have bad trips, the solutions and how a bad trip can be part of the processing. I cant do it because I am on ssri's. But one day i would like to. Finding the right therapist is essential... ( lots of charlatans out there). Overall It has a good success rate with ptsd. It is also being used successfully for people who are terminally ill and terrified of dying. It is interesting in my opinion."

175981118,Well I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was 14 on and off medication. When I was younger they said depression . At the time I didn’t know it ran in my family. As I got older things were on until I was about 26 I started taking risks drinking a lot . Doing dumb things and going through long periods of regretting what I had done. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 around 28 and it has been a roller coaster ever since.

175981124,"Wow, _NAME_, you tried a lot of meds. I don't think I could tolerate all of that, knowing each time that the med you try might not work, and dealing with all of the effects of withdrawal, or cross tapering, and the start-up side effects, etc. You must be pretty strong... i sometimes think something more ""sedating"" might be OK for me, since I sometimes have trouble sleeping. So it might help with that and also calm down my anxiety. But of course I would not want to be, or feel, sedated during the day. (One night a week or two ago I took a Unisom Sleep Tab at night and I was drowsy the whole next day). The p-doc said he would suggest Paxil if we conclude that Zoloft does not work for me. But after reading some about Paxil, I don't think I would do that. Too many side effects and difficult withdrawal. I asked my doc about Buspar and he said it usually does not work for his patients. I also asked a friend who is a psychiatrist and she said the same thing. I think I am going to stick with the Zoloft 5
0mg for another couple of weeks and see if it helps -- and also whether the side effects -- which for me are mostly sleep disturbance / morning agitation -- subside. Then I will figure out what to do. Maybe go off all meds, or maybe stay on Zoloft 50mg, or maybe increase to Zoloft 75mg, or maybe switch to a different med, though I am not sure I can deal with that..."
175981125,"I have a form of dissociation - Maybe from the small micromushdose and not being productive. I thought of taking an extra Dexedrine but an extra 5mg olanzepine works just fine. They both do the same thing except with the stimulant, I don't sleep. Weed could trigger panic so I'll drink rum. ^ Someone with good mental health coping mechanisms (Not.. Never had..)

My face hurts from drooping so much and I feel like one part of me is slapping myself silly trying to say GET over it. And the other side is numb and barely alive.

175981134,"I’m so sorry your going through such a rough time! I hope your aunt has good results from the chemo. I have crohns and have definitely had issues with the most significant trigger being stress. My last flare I had been in what appeared to be remission, no symptoms for about a year or more, then my mom who has health issues to begin got very sick and I was told she had a low chance of making it. She made to through thank goodness but it was the most stressful time of my life. Out of know where I ended up with a stricture and partial obstruction, hospitalized and very ill. Had no symptoms prior. I do believe stress played a role. Every flare I’ve had I could tie to some stressful time. That being said once I started on remicade the stress has no longer brought on crohns flares, just anxiety and panic attacks haha. Stress is known to mess with the immune system so it makes sense that it contributes to flares of IBD."

175981168,"I had wanted to post this in the thread about the book by _NAME_ Stone, MD, entitled, The Anatomy of Evil , which began with the _PERSON_ diagram labeled, Where Personality Disorder and Evil Intersect. According to the original post in that thread, Dr. Stone has concluded that, while schizoid personality is present in only about 1% of the population, it is present in 50% of serial killers. There was so much wrong surrounding the _PERSON_ diagram and its author's conclusion that I don't know where to begin. To many lay people, the medical degree can imply virtual omniscience. Many do not stop to consider that, to know anything deeply, the boundaries of one's specialty must needs be narrow. Not only that, but as schizoids know all too well, few medical specialists are even acquainted with, much less experts in, diagnosing SPD. In my very limited reading about SPD, I have never seen Dr. _PERSON_ name mentioned before. To arrive at such an alarming conclusion credibly, Dr. Stone would have had to have 
treated many schizoids for a long time--long enough for a statistically significant number of them to have opened up to him. Ideally, Dr. Stone also would have had to have met and worked directly with a statistically significant number of serial killers. Did he do those things? Another problem I have with Dr. Stone is that he titled his book, The Anatomy of Evil , as opposed to, An Anatomy of Evil . Not only does Dr. Stone seem to imply that the buck stops with his book, but he appears to be attempting to connect objective analysis ('Anatomy') with morality ('Evil'). How Medieval. Dr. Stone presumes to be an expert in a rare personality disorder whose sufferers even more rarely seek treatment, an expert on serial killers, and a _USER_ID_ who has managed to apply scientific methods to the study of moral failure. I don't think even _NAME_ would have presumed so much. And the _PERSON_ diagram. How did Dr. Stone arrive at the relative sizes and arrangement of the sets? How did he arrive at the amount of overlap? 
While what was shown is, of course, not the whole work, the assumptions, generalities, and apparent lack of rigor, compounded by the lurid conclusion, make this a dangerous book. _NAME_ Stone, MD, appears to be assigning the blame for some of society's ugliest crimes to an already marginalized population, one often afflicted with indifference regarding its own existence . That Dr. Stone appears to do this in such a cavalier manner is not only unscientific but ignorant, criminal, inhuman, and, dare I say, Evil."

175981195,"What I know about it is that the legal definition is different than the psychiatric definition (if there is a psychiatric definition of it at all). I know that if pleading the insanity defense, the defendant claims that he or she had little or no control over his or her behavior that led to or caused the alleged crime. People who use the insanity defense often claim that mens rea is impossible or unlikely to be proven. Mens rea, or a guilty mind, has to do with one's intention to commit a crime. Hence, the argument goes something like: if you cannot know that you are committing a crime, then you won't be able to prove mens rea because you don't have a state of mind that permits you to have the knowledge that you are committing a crime. The other element of criminality is the actus reus. This has to do with the action that is prohibited. I am not a lawyer, but I think it's probably equally hard to prove both mens rea and actus reus. But, if you cannot prove one or the other, then that will lead to t
he person not being convicted. I think that the insanity defense mostly influences mens rea. I think that either way, even if you get off because of the insanity defense, you are still liable to be committed to a mental institution for an indefinite period of time in a lot of cases. So it's not like pleading insanity is going to get you off lightly. I am mostly looking at this from a philosophical perspective, as I wrote a paper on the insanity defense one time for a philosophy of law class."

174376498,"For those of you who don't already know- there is a large percentage of society who are verbally and/or telepathically abusing people on a consistent basis. They mock and tease and harass without regard for their fellow man until the targeted individual is pushed over the edge to either lose their minds or to lose their heads(end up in jail). After several years of being abused I have been pushed to the fringes of society, and yet they pretend as if this reality is some sort of secret. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and prescribed an unnecessary and ineffective medication while my abusers run freely to torture whomever they please. If you ask these individuals about it they feign ignorance, and there's no point in having a discussion with them. Please respond if you are in the same situation as me. Hopefully, Everyone who is living the lye will end up in hell for it, but I would like to propose an alternative for those who actually care. There's something called Chakra release which I hav
e mastered and this power will replace telepathy if the people will accept it. It sends a sort of shock through the nervous system which is very pleasurable. The only problem is that telepathy interferes with this amazing sensation, and the people who use telepathy are abusers whether they know it or not. They are preventing the future which is one of pure bliss through Chakra release from taking over. Telepathy is a tool for those who like to manipulate others, so join me in the fight against the unnecessary evil of this world! Electronic harassment, electromagnetic torture, or psychotronic torture is a conspiracy theory that government agents make use of electromagnetic radiation (such as the microwave auditory effect), radar, and surveillance techniques to transmit sounds and thoughts into people's heads, affect people's bodies, and harass people.[1][2] Individuals who claim to experience this call themselves ""targeted individuals"" (""this""). They claim they are victims of gang stalking and many have jo
ined support and advocacy groups.[3][4] Multiple medical professionals have evaluated that these experiences are hallucinations; the result of delusional disorders or psychosis,[5][6] the same sources from which arise religious delusions, accounts of alien abductions, and beliefs in visitations from dead relatives. It can be difficult to persuade people who experience them that their belief in an external influence is delusional.[1][2] The experiences of people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment using esoteric technology, and who call themselves ""targeted individuals"" (""T.I.""), vary, but experiences often include hearing voices in their heads calling them by name, often mocking them or others around them, as well as physical sensations like burning.[1][2] They have also described being under physical surveillance by one or more people.[1] Many of these people act and function otherwise normally and included among them are people who are successful in their careers and lives otherw
ise, and who find these experiences confusing, upsetting, and sometimes shameful, but entirely real.[1] They use news stories, military journals, and declassified national security documents to support their allegations that governments have developed technology that can send voices into people's heads and cause them to feel things.[1] The New York Times estimated that there are more than 10,000 people who self-identify as targeted individuals.[7][8] Psychologist _NAME_ co-authored a study of gang-stalking in the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology. According to _NAME_, ""One has to think of the T.I. a phenomenon in terms of people with paranoid symptoms who have hit upon the gang-stalking idea as an explanation of what is happening to them"".[7] Mental health professionals say that T.I.s can experience hallucinations and their explanations of being targeted or harassed arise from delusional disorders or psychosis.[1][6][9][5][10] Yale psychiatry professor _NAME_ states that people often ascribe voice
s in their heads to external sources such as government harassment, God, or dead relatives, and it can be difficult to persuade these individuals that their belief in an external influence is delusional.[1] Other experts compare these stories to accounts of alien abductions.[2] Press accounts have documented individuals who apparently believed they were victims of electronic harassment, and in some cases persuaded courts to agree. In 2008, _NAME_ went to court claiming that his former business associate had threatened him with ""jolts of radiation"" after a disagreement, and later claimed feeling symptoms such as electric shock sensations and hearing strange sounds in his ears. The court decided to issue an order banning ""electronic means"" to further harass _PERSON_.[11]"

175981214,"Hello forum, It's been years since I posted on HW and wow a lot has happened in my life since! Short background - I am BP type II with ultradian cycling. I have tried a lot of meds over 12 years and finally tried Lithium this past year which was truly the only medication that I found helpful (other than my Seroquel that gets my sleep for me each night) however I couldn't stay on it due to the stomach side effects. Within the last year, I lost my career that I loved more than anything and had to start two new jobs. My Mom's stage IV lung cancer which she has by total miracle survived for over 8 years has come back to a new spot close to her other tumor on her right hip. This happened in June. Just before Christmas we found out the cancer has spread to her throat - she is consulting with an ENT surgeon tomorrow. She is actually seeing the ENT surgeon that saved my own life this past year after I suffered a bleed after a tonsillectomy. Ya that happened. I had emergency surgery and a brutal recovery bu
t obviously so grateful to be alive! She is good hands but with throat cancer I don't know what we are facing and tomorrow will be a tough day of answers. My step dad also now might have cancer they are looking into. The other biggest stressor for the past 1.5 years - my relationship. Reconnected through facebook with a man I went to highschool with 19 years ago as he was being transferred in the military to my area. We fell in love very quickly - he was the most wonderful guy in highschool and for the most part he is a wonderful man. Unfortunately he has a temper that can come out often enough and I""ve been down that road before. Also - he was transferred back out of my area within 6 months so the bulk of our relationship has been long distance (1.5 hour drive). I have been single 5 years since my last relationship before him and all I want is to have someone under the same roof. A real partner, to come home to. Our long distance doesn't have a chance at changing any time soon. He hasn't dealt with his lega
l separation or divorce from his ex and we've run into new issues with her. He has two wonderful kids who I love. But as a totality this relationship has almost constant triggers and doesn't have a good foundation (I have ended it 6 times) nor does it appear to have a good future .... SO. Needless to say, I have had WAY too much on my plate and as we all know stress is one of our biggest triggers. I don't know how I haven't ended up in hospital. But as mentioned in my subject line I did go off work two months ago today. I have 7 remaining paid weeks left before I would have to return for financial reasons. I am dreading going back. The people there have been ignorant in asking about me (a friend of mine has reported to me who works in the dept). I hesitated taking a leave for the _USER_ID_ reasons for over 6 months and now I will be heading back into exactly that. I am just overwhelmed so thanks for reading.

175981226,"This reminds me of the schizoid fantasy thing. Not wanting to be anything, able to be everything. I can imagine, if that kind of thinking dominates a person, then that specific step will be very hard. It might also explain a heightened fear of ""suddenly taken away"", because imagination quickly vanishes and reappears, while reality normally vanishes more slowly and there is more constancy. I find that weird. I think its essential to know, even before you chose to start. Hmm dunno, I dont have it like this. It reminds me of what I've read in some books (lel) about pwSPD having engulfment fears, or fears of being devoured by another person. I'd probably look into that direction. But can be many things that trigger this of course. I dont know if its a normal thing with stuff that gets blocked like this but there is a high anxiety towards emotions., and certain emotional stuff in others makes me remote embarassed, too.

I forget all about my problems because I can't fit them into my conscious awareness at a time. I talked with my sister for a couple hour. Walked to the mail box, nothing there. Waiting for the IRS website to update so I can get my stim check. It's not all bad. I had a tuna fish _NAME_ for lunch, edited my book again, and watched Better call _NAME_ and Game of Thrones. This was the perfect time to get HBO Now. Me and my sister asked ourselves what are we going to do about our lives, both feeling existential angst. She wrote two children's books that were very good. I loved them. However, writing is our passion, we won't make money I feel. I could try to be a therapist, my roommate said Id make a great one after she told me her psychologist reminds her of me. The woman I work said I should be one because im so good at asking questions. I'
ve done so many wrong things that I'd be a hypocrite to judge anyone. It's not that great of a jump considering psychology was my minor and I wanted to specialize in philosophy of psychology to be precise. All of my books are psychology in narrative.

175981237,"I gathered from the fact that you posted it. Cigarettes deserve their warning label. WHO publishes that it kills 7 million people through direct use and another million through second-hand exposure. Moreover, the mechanism through which smoking kills people is documented. Sugar MIGHT deserve a warning label, but not for the making people fat and the rotting teeth. As a part of a bad diet with fats and processed foods, it's a large contributor to heart disease. It's just that the science is a little murky outside of linkage studies. I think we'll eventually get there on the warning labels for fatty, high sugar, processed foods."

175981240,Google gave me like no results on anything. _PERSON_. Nothing that makes sense to me anyway. It says I’m crazy that I’m psychotic. Am I? I feel people are watching me. These meds are supposed to stop that. My mood is ****ing around with me it’s too much for the meds. I’m not stable at all. I’m not fine. These meds aren’t doing anything except make me not depressed. I don’t understand. It’s annoying. I’m trying to study but I can’t focus.
175981241,Great it's starting to rain
175981242,Good Luck!
175981243,Thank you for the reply. I have quite a few friends at church so that helps me. Today I was going along ok then out of the blue I started getting anxious and unsettled. I cannot concentrate when this happens to me. Every little thing worries me and I have enough to worry about having cancer. I am gearing up for a migraine right now as this happens during a bad day of anxiety. I can feel the pain around my eye building. I would love to have valium to take but my dr said no. It has gotten to the point most drs don't like prescribing meds any longer. God bless you all

174376561,"I’m basically back to square one with my medicines. Not enough so I go up. Too much cuz I’m sleeping and there’s nothing in between the doses. I’ve literally tried every AP on the FDA approved list except clozapine (I cant due to some underlying health issue or something. Was told that years ago). Plus niacin, sarcosine, b3 and a load of other stuff. Meds either don’t work at all or the side effects are not able to be lived with. It’s so disappointing and just reiterates the fact that I have schizophrenia which id rather sometimes not think about. I’m one of those few people that will always live with voices going on in the background and will have to take meds to keep them in the background. They never go away and I think that’s what people don’t understand. The delusions go away but then they come back under high stress and they been coming back. I keep having this thought that I did when I was real sick, about people not telling me the worlds secret idk. And with this racial st
uff going on I’m getting slightly delusional, I hope, about what could happen to me. My own dad says not to live in fear, hes black, but idk."

175981253,"I think it's gone now. Sounds crazy considering how bad the anhedonia was.. I still don't want relationships but other than that, I'm back to how I was before it started at age 12. I did completely obliterate/deactivate the default mode network in my brain which I don't recommend - I think that it allowed my logical and creative brain to communicate and caused a massive 5 year long spiritual awakening.. Many ego death dissociative panic attacks caused me to feel nothing for periods of time.. Now I get periods of apathy/anhedonia for periods of time - Like it reversed now that I'm on olanzepine which 'modulates' the default mode network. The episodes of apathy can get really bad. Maybe I just have autism.. Using empathogen/entactogenics (Phenibut, psilocybin, ketamine, MDMA) helped to integrate myself into this state of mind.. What I needed maybe was to allow myself to express empathy.. Which was very hard being atheist and extremely logical - To understand that there's a metaphysical realm.. And th
at there should be balance.. Meditation/mindfulness helps. My moms drinking sure doesn't help. The neglect and abuse of society/school/structure/religion/step dad/isolation like I was in a concentration camp was ****_NAME_ up. I think you can just feel so much mental pain that the mind shuts off pleasure.. Being more sensitive to pain = More sensitive to pleasure.. That's the take away here.."

175981277,"A good link I found# Gaslighting is a malicious form of mental and emotional abuse, designed to plant seeds of self-doubt and alter your perception of reality. Like all abuse, it based on the need for power, control, or concealment. Some people occasionally lie or use denial to avoid taking responsibility. They may forget or remember conversations and events differently than you, or they may have no recollection due to a blackout if they were drinking. These situations are sometimes called gaslighting, but the term actually refers to a deliberate pattern of manipulation calculated to make the victim doubt his or her own perceptions or sanity, similar to brainwashing. The term derives from the play and later film Gaslight with _NAME_ and _NAME_. _PERSON_ plays a sensitive, trusting wife struggling to preserve her identity in an abusive marriage to _PERSON_, who tries to convince her that she’s ill in order to keep her from learning the truth. Gaslighting Behavior As in the movie, the perpetrator o
ften acts concerned and kind to dispel any suspicions. Someone capable of persistent lying and manipulation is also quite capable of being charming and seductive. Often the relationship often begins that way. When gaslighting starts, you might even feel guilty for doubting the person whom you’ve come to trust. To further play with your mind, an abuser might offer evidence to show that you’re wrong or question your memory or senses. More justifications and explanations, including expressions of love and flattery, are concocted to confuse you and reason away any discrepancies in the liar’s story. You get temporary reassurance, but increasingly, you doubt your own senses, ignore your gut, and become more confused. The person gaslighting might act hurt and indignant or play the victim when challenged or questioned. Covert manipulation can easily turn into overt abuse with accusations that you’re distrustful, ungrateful, unkind, overly sensitive, dishonest, stupid, insecure, crazy, or abusive. Abuse might 
escalate to anger and intimidation with punishment, threats, or bullying if you don’t accept the false version of reality. Gaslighting can take place in the workplace or in any relationship. Generally, it concerns control, infidelity, or money. A typical scenario is when an intimate partner lies to conceal a relationship with someone else. In other cases, it may be to conceal gambling debts or stock or investment losses. The manipulator is often an addict, a narcissist, or a sociopath, particularly if gaslighting is premeditated or used to cover up a crime. In one case, a sociopath was stealing from his girlfriend whose apartment he shared. She gave him money each month to pay the landlord, but he kept it. He hacked into her credit cards and bank accounts, but was so devious that to induce her trust he bought her gifts with her money and pretended to help her find the hacker. It was only when the landlord eventually informed her that she was way behind in the rent that she discovered her boyfriend’s treac
hery. When the motive is purely control, a spouse might use shame to undermine his or her partner’s confidence, loyalty, or intelligence. A wife might attack her husband’s manhood and manipulate him by calling him weak or spineless. A husband might undermine his wife’s self-esteem by criticizing her looks or competence professionally or as a mother. A typical tactic is to either claim that friends or relatives agree with the manipulator’s negative statements or to disparage them so that that they cannot be trusted in order to isolate the victim and gain greater control. A similar strategy is to undermine the partner’s relationships with friends and relatives by accusing him or her of disloyalty. Effects of Gaslighting Gaslighting can be very insidious the longer it occurs. Initially, you won’t realize you’re being affected by it, but gradually you lose trust in your own instincts and perceptions. It can be very damaging, particularly in a relationship built on trust and love. Love and attachment 
are strong incentives to believe the lies and manipulation. We use denial, because we rather believe the lie than the truth, which might precipitate a painful breakup. Gaslighting can damage our self-confidence and self-esteem, trust in ourselves and reality, and our openness to love again. If it involves verbal abuse, we may believe the truth of the abuser’s criticisms and continue to blame and judge ourselves even after the relationship is over. Many abusers putdown and intimidate their partners to make them dependent so they won’t leave. Examples are: “You’ll never find anyone as good as me,” “The grass isn’t greener,” or “No one else would put up with you.” Article continues below... TALK TO A THERAPIST NOW: Therapists live, online right now, from BetterHelp: _NAME_ Green _NAME_ Green, LCSW, MSW _NAME_, MS, LPC, NCC _NAME_, LCSW Heather _PERSON_ Heather _PERSON_, MS, LADC, LPC _NAME_, LPC, NCC _NAME_, LCSW-R Recovery from a breakup or divorce can be more difficult when we’ve been in 
denial about problems in the relationship. Denial often continues even after the truth comes out. In the story described above, the woman got engaged to her boyfriend after she found out what he’d done. It takes time for us to reinterpret our experience in light of all the facts once they become known. It can be quite confusing, because we may love the charmer, but hate the abuser. This is especially true if all the bad behavior was out of sight, and memories of the relationship were mostly positive. We lose not only the relationship and person we loved and/or shared a life with, but also trust in ourselves and future relationships. Even if we don’t leave, the relationship is forever changed. In some cases when both partners are motivated to stay and work together in conjoint therapy, the relationship can be strengthened and the past forgiven. Recovery from Gaslighting Learn to identify the perpetrator’s behavior patterns. Realize that they’re due to his or her insecurity and shame, not yours. Get sup
port. It’s critical that you have a strong support system to validate your reality in order to combat gaslighting. Isolation makes the problem worse and relinquishes your power to the abuser. Join Codependents Anonymous (CoDA.org) and seek counseling. Once you acknowledge what’s going on, you’re more able to detach and not believe or react to falsehoods, even though you may want to. You’ll also realize that the gaslighting is occurring due to your partner’s serious characterlogical problems. It does not reflect on you, nor can you change someone else. For an abuser to change, it takes willingness and effort by both partners. Sometimes when one person changes, the other also does in response. However, if he or she is an addict or has a personality disorder, change is difficult. To assess your relationship and effectively confront unwanted behavior, get my book Dealing with a Narcissist: 8 Steps to raise Self-Esteem and Set Boundaries with Difficult People. Once victims come out of denial, it’s comm
on for them to mentally want to redo the past. They’re often self-critical for not having trusted themselves or stood up to the abuse. Don’t do this! Instead of perpetuating self-abuse, learn how to stop self-criticism and raise your self-esteem. You also need to learn how to be assertive and how to set boundaries to stop abuse. ©Darlenelancer 2017"

175981292,"In some ways, that is pretty complex. So, they won't let you have the two prescriptions for the pristiq, one for 100mg and a second for 50mg (since what you need is 150mg), because that's 2 prescriptions? What, they have a limit on prescriptions? It's like a guillotine. Even if your doctor says you need it? I know one of the rules used to be, if the psychiatrist recommended something, the insurance company doctor could use his judgement, and say that was too much. But if the psychiatrist really, really wanted that, the insurance company would grant it. It's not like that now? Well, just like you said further in your post, ""...I know I need more but my insurance wont pay for more pristiq, so we have been trying to add another med but I haven't been able to tolerate side effects."" If ""we have been trying to add another med,"" to go with the first script of 100mg prestiq, that's 2 scripts right there, or 1 for prestiq and another for a 2nd med. It's the same as 1 script for 100mg of pristiq, and a 
2nd script for 50mg of prestiq, or, 2 scripts. So, why can't they give you 2 scrpits of prestiq (one for 100mg and one for 50mg), if they are willing to give you the 2 scripts of 100mg of prestiq and a 2nd script of ""another med.""

The higher the dose, the faster it kicks in but that's not how all meds or drugs work..

175981307,"Had a boring day at work. Didn't get much done. But on Twitter my love posted and I replied and he liked my comments and replied to me! It's real, I tell you. Sending me messages that it's true. Now I'm trying to study. Try to work on a program, or maybe review precalculus. Not sure yet. Got my increase for Latuda to pick up later. I haven't left the house (aside from taking the dog for a short walk) in about a week and a half... I don't really want to leave but it's best to get the meds today so I can start tonight. I had some more breakthrough thoughts that my thoughts were being stolen. I didn't drink coffee this morning. I had green tea instead. So I didn't feel jittery or dissociative. I am drinking an energy drink right now though to study... Probably not a good idea. Anyway, that's how I am right now. See how the rest of the day goes."

175981311,"Hi LUV, Sorry to hear of your trouble with neck pain. I used to have it real bad. Chiropractic really helped me. Just a suggestion (up to you whether to try it), but I would go see a chiro as soon as possible. He/she may be able to do an adjustment that will help you. Other than that, I would go along with the suggestion of trying alternating heat and cold. And by the way, you don't have to go buy a cold pack, just put some ice cubes in a plastic storage bag and use that. Good luck!"
175981312,Just had a cup of black coffee.
175981313,Sorry you’re feeling depressed and that things are getting worse as you get older... Have I told you the pick three technique? If you do it early enough in a depression you can turn it around.

175981316,"He thinks I'm not a fun person cuz I dont do that stuff. I wasnt raised that way. My parents dont smoke cigarettes or anything else, and honestly they both barely drink now. I've offered him to do lots of things with me while we've been here but he just thinks things I do are not fun cuz they dont involve pot or whatever. I dont understand why people cant have simple fun. And why people cant be sober. Idk. I really dont know. I got onto him this morning because I told him he never really follows safety or laws. Like my 3 examples to him were, how he sometimes doesnt wear his seatbelts, this boat thing (apparently him and his brother is gonna be smoking pot and NOT wearing lifejackets, with their mom sitting in the back of the boat so they are putting her in danger too even tho she doesnt smoke anything), and how he didnt want to renew his license because it was too expensive and didnt have time (when he had gotten stopped for speeding a month earlier) and I had to renew it on his behalf AND pay for 
it... I swear to god man."

175981322,"Looking back on Christmas' of previous years, this one was a win. I'm not in the hospital, I'm coherent and the happiness is tangible. However, I still can't quite shake this ache in my heart. An ache to feel connection. I feel so distant from family and friends, i'm wondering what's wrong with me. All the basics are still hard, eye contact, when to speak, compartmentalizing my thoughts. Everything feels like a chore. I used to connect so easily or maybe I didn't. I know the breakdowns took pieces of me, and for that i'm lost. I have rebuilt my life so many times that i'm not sure if I can do it again. To all those feeling isolated, and alone, you're not!"

175981331,"Had my last appointment with my case manager last night. It went well. She did another depression screening. Average is 50. The first time I took it I got a 23 or a 21. Then the next time I took it I got an 18. Then last night I got a 31. So that is a good improvement. She wanted to see a 50 but I think it would be impossible to get a 50 score. I'm going to miss her a little but I think I'll be okay. She was just so positive and encouraging, you know? I talked to her for about 4 months."
175981332,You struggled through so much. I cannot even imagine. My brother mostly cared for my mum when she got really bad. I mentioned already she was hospitalised with severe depression after my dad died. She got better with drugs. But then 6 months later decided she is done with antidepressants. My brother hates pills and doesn't trust doctors. So it just went downhill from there. My mum got extreme agoraphobia and couldn't leave the house for 4 years. It was a nightmare. She spent her days in bed and in the end got an embolism and it was fatal. This is basically a cautionary tale about never stopping your pills. My brother was appalled when I told him I started taking antidepressants. But well I am so scared of getting more depressed and I unlike him trust medicine because it saved my life before. So mental health is not a joke. Keep going. You made it this far!
174376727,"So this thread is just going to be somewhat of a rant. First off, counselors are worthless scumbags paid by the state to remove rights from people. I unfortunately had to learn this the hard way after I first entered counseling when my ***** of a mother told my counselor everything that was going on with me at the time, so she went and had me committed for almost three weeks. When I was there, I suffered so much abuse, from pharmacological torture, to solitary confinement to bullying, that I tried to kill myself while I was in the hospital. From that moment forward, my life and freedoms have been gone and so has my trust for counselors. That's also the reason why I turn to online for help, is because I have no friends in real life and because everything you say to a counselor is NOT confidential. They can and will lie to you about certain things, such as a thing that happened to me recently. And the medication is only treatment. In fact, it's called TREATMENT for a reason, because it's only a tempo
rary fix. By using it, you become a drug addict. In truth, there are many causes of mental illness, however from some recent studies that I've found is that consumption of seeds is actually one of the main causes of mental illness. In fact, grains rot your teeth. That's why there's been links between celiac disease and Schizophrenia. The true cure for all mental illness is simply changing your diet. Most Americans eat mostly vegetables and grains. Look at the food pyramid, which has been vegan since 2005. It says you need to eat plenty of GRAINS, which is not what you're supposed to eat if you want to remain healthy. If you want to cure yourself of mental illness, all that is needed is to simply change your diet. And by that, I mean namely either the zero carb (carnivore) diet or at least keto. There has been much research on this, and it all suggests that other than environmental causes, poor dietary choices is one of the leading causes of mental illness in America. Because on the one hand, you have the doct
ors who just want you to believe everything that Big Pharma says to make a profit because capitalism while on the other hand, the change lies within you. Also, can anyone find more studies to back me up? I can't remember where most of them were, but I watched some YouTube videos and read some articles over the years and it all seems to be pointing in this direction."

175981334,"I can feel this way too. It's like how when I reached ""Rock bottom"" with addiction. I was like, ok wait.. ""All of these addicted people need to go into the depths of realization of what is important if they don't die? That's stupid!"". I was fully aware of this jinx... I think it's a natural thing to let go when it's too hard to hold on and keep yourself together... Imagine _PERSON_ if she let her apartment be a mess, took no responsibility and didn't care if she got kicked out.. That's what I did.. And then you go up certain levels, climbing and climbing - Two steps forward and one step back.. I was falling and falling after I stood in the same spot for a decade, watching opportunities fly past me, being immersed in depression. We need the calm clearness of water and the other 3 elements - They exist for a reason. We're in a dimension that means something in the form of symbolism, pictures, thoughts, potential actions, feelings. We all just want a good life and to stop suffering. There's some t
hings that can capture your will to live and such if you seek them out and have hope. My ""365 happiness quote jar"" read ""To lose hope is to cease to live"" last night."

175981339,I slept till 3pm today. I was gonna go to the pharmacy to pick up my meds but due to being lazy I ended up ordering them to be delivered since I don't feel like going anywhere. So my meds should be delivered tomorrow afternoon. Then I can start the metformin Sunday morning. Still need to return some books to the library at some point next week. Had leftover Italian sausage and meatballs over pasta for dinner. Have to clean this weekend. Apartment is messy.
175981340,I don't know what's wrong. I have no friends that understand what I'm dealing with because they think depression is something made up. So I suffer alone.

Ear canals clear of wax, eardrum intact, and no fluid behind the drum. I did a hearing test online and my hearing range went from a max of 16KHz down to 13KHz. I will keep an ear out (pun intended) for it over the next month and if it does not get better I will contact my doctor."

I have not gone outside but the heat from the windows is searing hot. I will go out tomorrow to shop for food again. I finally will be over 20 hours a week next month for teaching. I am exhausted though from this past week and need to focus just on work to survive. I will be ok as long as I take my medication and do some self-care. I am ok but not ecstatic because I am tired. I have not really exercised lately but will tomorrow because I need to walk to the store and back. I will try to fit in studying for my exam a little by little.

175981358,"Hey _PERSON_ and brit-y-bird! I am also 27 and living with bipolar. It was officially diagnosed when I was in college (around 19). I knew that there was something wrong for a long time before that. I started drinking at the age of 12 to try and numb a lot of the shit that I was going through at the time. I still struggle with drinking and weed to this day. I have been on and off medication...because I let the thoughts talk me in and out of it. I have done so much stupid shit to cope with this or giving into the negative thoughts. Now I have two little boys that I have to get well and stay well for. I think about the dangerous or dumb stuff that I have done to myself in the past and I get overwhelmed with anxiety and depression. It's a battle but we are still here fighting. _PERSON_: I totally understand what you mean about it being a _USER_ID_. It's hard to relax and feel ok when you have no idea what is going to happen with you in the next month, day, shit hour. Medication sucks and it is stressfu
l when it isn't right or you are having to wait for it to work. The biggest thing I hate about the medications we can take for it take like 6 weeks to get the point where they ""work."" I don't know about you, but it is very hard for me to take medication everyday for a week. Let alone 6. Right now is the longest I have been on medication. I have to have a support network to make that happen though. brit-y-bird: It is really hard to enjoy the good moments when you don't know when the shit is going to come. Everyone says ""your just anticipating the worst."" Screw that. If you don't live with it, it's really hard to understand. It sucks that you have had to wait that long for an official diagnosis. Thank you for sharing your story as well. How are you doing with your new diagnosis? Are you taking medication for it? Both of you: Thank for sharing your stories. It is very nice to know that I'm not alone. Its great to be able to find someone that can relate to you on that level. It is hard to explain to some peop
le what it is like to have it. I have said it on other posts, but I am an open book. If you just want to talk, have questions or anything, just send me a message or reply. I check in here most nights."

175981371,"...but it is not always my friend. Woke up this morning depressed and not wanting to be on the earth. I had plans for the crew I work with, but due to my depression they all fell through - which made me feel even worse. There are two people retiring from my organization and after I dropped off their cards to their boxes, I went to the break room and started crying because I had to release the emotions that filled me. While I was crying on of the counselors had come to the break room for something and she noticed me crying and started talking to me. She lifted my spirits up enough that I could start my day. One of my coworkers arrived and I informed her how I'm feeling and she went to another room to do some printing for a teacher. This left me alone in a classroom with things that my substitute teacher had left for me to do. So I am in a classroom by myself with a list of things to accomplish and I feel isolated, underappreciated, and the scum of the earth. However, once I started on the list I sta
rted to feel better...not 100%...maybe about 50% better. I hope I can accomplish everything on the list because I will feel like a failure if it doesn't happen because I know the person who is substituting for my lead teacher and we have had a troubling relationship in the past."

I spoke to my psychiatrist about it and she said it’s akathisia. She said if it’s not too distressing that we can just leave it alone, but if it gets worse that she can prescribe something to help with it. I don’t want to go off of Abilify because it’s helping me quite a bit more than other APs have. Does anyone have any luck with a med helping with akathisia?"

She'll kill me. you don't want her to kill me now do you?"" As i said, ""I promise I wont tell mommy"". Then I would stare at the door in the other room scared to death.

I told my mom to go to bed and said ""I love you - goodnight"" and then she said she needed her water refilled so I came back into her room and then she said ""Where is - (My sister)"". I straight up told her ""Stop pretending"" and ""I'm not doing this bs anymore. You know exactly what you're doing. You're sick. You need to stop manipulating me"". She admitted to it and now feels like crap - So probably will ask for attention again. I'm not good at expressing emotions and she knows it so she manipulates me. I told her that I'm speaking with my therapist in the morning so I can move out because I can't focus when she drinks all the time. The thing is, I know that people try to get away with things and blame it on the alcohol. I've been drunk and on many many mind altering substances and I stil
l have it all together most times. I told her that she's doing it for attention and she admitted it - Because I'm starting to realize that she has been manipulating me and my mental illness this whole time."

She’s still very mad at the employers that let her go, even though she’s found a better job. We’ve gone through phases of extreme affection and extreme distancing, each lasting a few days at a time. She’s angry one minute and happy the next. 10 weeks ago, we had an very affectionate day, then the next day she was cold with me. A week after that she said she was ending the marriage. She’s since asked for a divorce. Our oldest daughter was hurt in boot camp and left the Navy. She’s at home with us. My wife has often threate
ned to kick her out, but I’ve been able to buffer that, but when I push the daughter to make a plan for her life, I’m a bad person. I’m currently living with my mother and my oldest daughter told me today that my wife is joking one minute, then screaming at the top of her lungs, then right back to joking, all within a 10-15 minute time frame. She mentioned that she had thought about suicide while she was making the decision to leave me, but couldn’t do that to her kids. How worried should I be about our kids and my soon to be ex wife. As much as I’d like to salvage our 27 years together, I know our marriage is over. I just want to make sure that my wife and especially the kids are safe. Thanks."

I know I'm going to get through the day because I always do but this feeling is exhausting and I just want to wake up and feel ok . I fught through wanting to just not care stay home and nktvworey but that's impossible for me . I worry about everything.

174376820,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_ psychotic It's best to get these things checked out early. Early intervention is key. I don't have schizophrenia though my great grandpa did. But I have depression with psychotic features. Thing is, I had depression for at least four years before I started getting treatment for it. I don't know if earlier treatment may have caught the psychotic features part and maybe dealt with that sooner. But the time that I didn't get the depression treated means it just got worse and worse. I couldn't control it. It spiraled out of my control. HUGS to you. _PERSON_"

If the traffic light is red every single time you stop at an intersection, that doesn't mean you're unlucky or the light is out to get you, it just means you don't stop at the intersection when the light is green. The light is indeed red every single time you stop, and that's an accurate statement, but it's still miles away from being an accurate assessment of reality. Accuracy, truth, reality, faithfulness and good intentions are all different things. As for myself, within my ability, I treat people the way I want to be treated. And, within reason, that also includes taking into account the fact that they won't expect or benefit or suffer exactly from the same exact things as I would. Because it's one of the main things I want others to consider when I'm concerned as well. Namely: they're not me, and I'm not them. If people fail to reciprocate, then I reciprocate their failure. Some people take offense at that. That's the point when it's not up to me and not my problem

Hope I lose weight even if I eat the carbs. I skipped the last vape because I didn't want to be that cold again and I was done with meds and snack by 7:30.

175981425,"Hey guys thank you for your replies. Black _NAME_, the neurologist I just saw actually recommended that if I were to not go down the psychiatric medicine route I could try to take certain supplements and change my diet around. That is something that I have considered but haven't implemented yet because I have not been back to see him. It's something to keep in mind and possibly do before taking a medicine to see if taking supplements and such would benefit me in any way. _NAME_ my vertigo was like that too. I'd just be sitting down and then the room would start to spin uncontrollably. The way I would stop it is by closing my eyes. Quick tip I just learned recently, whenever you experience a vertigo or dizzy attack it's important to keep your eyes open and focus on one thing in the room or wherever you are. It helps it to go away quicker. Thank you for your praise _NAME_. I have this battle between my subconscious and my conscious mind all the time as well. My conscious mind wants me to get better w
hile my subconscious is afraid of and thinks negatively of ways of doing so allowing me to stay in the spot where I am which I would assume my body and mind are comfortable with but I am certainly not."

174376855,"Hello _PERSON_: Thank you for sharing your concern with us here on PC. I'm sorry I'm not going to be of any help with this. (Perhaps there may yet be other PC members who will have some thoughts they can share.) In the meantime, however, I noticed this is your first post. So I thought I would at least say welcome to Psych Central. Most of us, here on PC, are consumers of mental health services not mental health professionals. And, based on what you wrote, it sounds to me as though figuring out what is actually going on with your gf, as well as what to do about it, is a job for a mental health professional... perhaps a psychologist, a psychiatrist or a mental health therapist. You didn't mention if your gf is under the care of any type(s) of mental health professional(s). If not, I think the best thing that could be done to assist her may be to help her to find appropriate mental health treatment. Here are links to 4 articles, from Psych Central's archives, that may be of interest depending on your

175981430,"Annon_mom. You are very welcome, here at Inspire! Your question of how to help him has a very negative answer....UNLESS HE WANTS HELP! If he has no urge to help himself, there is really nothing you can do. That is the extremely difficult part, for you to accept. You can break your neck trying, but unless he reaches somewhere...to someone, nothing works. He is being held by 2 very powerful addictions...they are in control...he is not. The place to begin would be with AA, but he has to agree to go. The only real leverage you have is to offer to walk away UNLESS he agrees to get help. That is not a pretty option for you, because likely you cannot bring yourself to do that, although it would protect you from a mountain of heartaches. Without him reaching for help your situation cannot be good, regardless of the years together. Come back and chat some more should you want to. I will watch for you."

175981455,"So I'm not a plebe for having found _PERSON_ an OR-deal, like, to the max? Thank you thank you! I remember having been only mildly moved by its theme much later. I was most taken by the description of pod behavior near Java. Really, you are tempting me to reread it, which I may, but, if this happens, it will be, at best, years hence. OK, despite having eaten, lived, and breathed TLOTR for years and years, unable to pick up anything ""serious"", lest I sink like a horse in a bottomless swamp of depression (referring to ""that famous scene"" from a movie of which I've seen just that one swamp scene), in retrospect, as an adult, I scorned it as an, at best, 2D tale which had been retold ad nauseam. Just last night, however, I was hit by an epiphany that, perhaps, it was WAY more than once I thought. So, of late, I understand anyone's desire to reread it. Thank you. The Decline and Fall of the _NAME_ Empire sounds absoLOOTly worth reading, and the audiobooks as ideal fodder for long-haul truckers. It i
sn't hard to find contemporary articles referring to those events (_NAME_ and trucking), but I'll wager few will have actually ""Moby Dicked"" any comprehensive, well-researched accounts. So, thank you for the worthy suggestion. For over a year now--hey, I love making people laugh--I have chewed on The Divine Comedy like an unwilling child on a piece of overcooked flank steak. However, unlike a gristly piece of meat, _NAME_ life's work continues to surprise me with small spectacular gems moreso than even ""the oldest surviving English crown ca. 1370-80"". If any English-speakers are in the mood for a truly life-changing, albeit slow-mo experience, I unreservedly recommend Mark _PERSON_ The Portable _NAME_ (Penguin Classics)."

They are very addicting and 10 years is a long time to be taking them. Has your son received any treatment for his addictions? That is one way he can get help for his other mental conditions as he deals with recovery off of methadone. There are also IOP and PHP. Which are intensive outpatient and partial hospitalizations. Tho they usually consist of 2-3 groups then you go home. And very little one on one help. There is a resource you can try that makes me wish I lived in NYC. Call 1-_PHONE_NO_ . It's called NYC Well. It's also a hotline in addition to great resources for much needed help. You can also google PsychologyToday.com. It will allow you to search just therapist who take medicaid. I pray that a do

Now that things have settled a bit, I'm trying to resume with my writing. It's not easy, but if I can manage to create something worthwhile and memorable, that will be enough of a legacy. Navigating through this bullshlt world day in and day out is a chore. Leaving some kind of stain will make it more worthwhile."
175981506,"One half of my chin keeps breaking out. I'm using the cream that my PCP doctor prescribed but it is not working well. No where else is breaking out, just half of my chin. I'm not sure if it is the face masks or if it is because I sleep on that side of my face, or what. But it is seriously annoying me. I got a new cleansing facewash that I am trying and hopefully that will help. And I'm washing my sheets and pillowcases more (okay well my Mom is actually washing them more) so I don't know what else to do. But it is bothering me. Ugh."
175981507,I'm straight away gonna do a Coursera course or something about cryptocurrency and blockchain. Am obsessed.
175981508,"Thank you all!! You’re experiences with this medicine does give me relief. I had read up on it (which is not the best to do) and kinda freaked out when I read how difficult it was to come off of it. Was it hard for you to come off of this medication? To be honest I am not too sure what the difference is between SNRI and SSRI. I have taken _PERSON_ in the past several times and each time it worked out great for me. But I am just so terrified of these medications, not knowing how it will affect me. When I would start _PERSON_ sometimes it would increase my anxiety and make me feel foggy. I never had trouble getting of lex. The doctor that prescribed me Effexor was not my usual doctor, I had made an appointment with a clinic and she is the one who assisted. I was feeling very anxious that day and I just wanted to go in to see if i could get something to relive my anxiety like klonopin but instead I got Effexor...I do have an appointment on Monday with my normal doctor and I’m going to see what he 
thinks about this."
175981509,I feel like crap physically. Too old to be doing this stuff.

175981512,"Morning! Sitting at my desk avoiding work lol. Guess it’s going to be one of those days. I have a *** ton of work too...I’ve been waiting for it to pick up and now that it has I don’t wanna ? Oh I didn’t tell you yesterday... I just ended up buying the computer the computer my boss suggested. He ended up paying for the actual computer!!!! Not the monitor and all that but the guts of it! So I was only on the hook for the monitor, support, and anti-virus. (I usually use AVG but my boss rqst’d paid anti-virus.). And i got 20% off the support. I made out pretty good. Though I’m now kind of wondering if this is taking the place of my annual raise ?"

175981514,"If I describe my moods, I might sound like the child: Difficult, defiant, quick to lose temper, sometimes inconsolably sad, often jumpingly happy, withdrawn, outgoing, inconsistent. I’m a contradiction come alive. I can change as quickly as the weather in fall, and then change back again, and then off again. Like a child. The trouble is, and it’s more trouble for my wife than for me, we already have a child. We need to be stable and consistent to help mold our daughter’s character and behavior. Usually I’m level and a good parent. But at times I lose it. At those times I’m as needy as an eight-year-old. Yet there’s already one of them in the house, looking to me for guidance.

174376980,Just wanted to share that I bought one of those subscriptions for food delivery where they deliver the ingredients and I make the meals with their recipes. It was kind of expensive but I think it's worth it so that I cook more at home. I got two meals a week from it. My first delivery comes on August 19! So I have a week from today to prepare.

175981527,"So my ex-boyfriend of five years, who was Schizoid, but also a total weeaboo (someone who OBSESSES over Japanese culture) introduced me to this genre of music called ""eurobeat"". He described it to me as ""Japan's disco music,"" and that immediately caught my attention and I enjoy it. Not like classical, but I think it's fun. I'd always call him a weeaboo and he'd be all ""I AM NOT A WEEABOO! I AM AN OTAKO!"" and I'd say back, ""the fact that you identify as a taco only proves my point."" But yes yes, here's a mix of eurobeat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdeIPfHlQuM"
175981528,"I'm feeling better today. More centered within myself. I think it was my former T's email yesterday. It was enough to stabilize me. I don't feel like I'm in crises now. I feel more stable. I hope it lasts. I forgot how it felt. My anxiety is rising a bit but I think that's because I had coffee. I'm trying to breathe deeply so it doesn't get out of control on me. I'm having a good day at work. I'm going to get a $200 Visa gift card as a bonus, and there's a meeting with free lunch on Thursday and I got free Starbucks today. Surely this feeling better can't have everything to do with all this free stuff! But I do feel better. Except for the anxiety. The anxiety is a little worrisome because it's like right on the edge of being too much. If I have to, I'll take some anxiety meds and then just end up getting sleepy. HUGS Kit"
175981529,Music sounds extra good tonight
175981530,"I think it varies for everyone, too - I watch tv before bed and often watch videos on my tablet before sleep, but rarely have issues sleeping. But I think the things mentioned are still good practice and could help enhance resting."

175981535,What’s wrong?
175981536,"This issue isn't specific to just the Anxiety Forum, but across the Boards. Unfortunately, most people don't feel comfortable posting or offering support, and it is a shame. I know the other Moderators do a great job of checking on multiple Forums, but it's almost impossible to be available 24-hrs a day on a volunteer basis.In the 5 years that I have been active on this Forum, it has become increasingly slow. There are still a lot of people that prefer to self-diagnose through Dr. _PERSON_. I think you are spot-on with your comments, and hopefully this community will continue to thrive. _NAME_"
175981537,Hopefully it helps....
175981538,I PM-_NAME_ you.
175981539,I think a lot of it is your personality...even when things were at their worst you had a lot going for you.

175981548,Having a panic attack
175981549,Hi It sounds like Shingles (Herpes Zoster) to me which is a viral infection and can be very painful I know because I have had it. It is related to the Chickenpox virus and anyone who has had Chickenpox as a kid can get Shingles in adult life and is usually brought on by stress and it’s nothing to do with herpes so not sexually transmitted. It causes a painful rash that then blisters and is usually only on one side of the body I had it on the right side of my neck and up onto right side of head. It can be treated with anti virals and usually runs it’s course over 2-4 weeks. Speak with your doctor again and see what they say. _PERSON_
174377008,"I cleaned my apartment although I was tired. I also am washing my laundry. I feel ok but this last week was exhausting! I take my medication daily. I am doing ok but feel tired.

175981551,"I've been sleeping like that too. I set my alarm on my phone and set it across my room so I have to get up to turn it off but I always end up just getting back under the covers and sleeping all day, even if I've already slept all night too. I need better self discipline"
175981552,I'm sorry newtus What's going on?
175981553,"Well, I got the anti b's from a relative lol. Didnt actually go to the doctor. I've been reading up on fungal infections. That was my go to answer a few years ago because fungal infections are super common. I've had awful athletes foot for over 6 months now. Infections of the leg and foot can cause lymph swelling in the groin. Could also be related to my constant sinus infections. Lymph nodes are still swollen. But my toes are also looking like they're gonna fall off and my sinuses are still giving me a fit."
175981554,"Its annual training that takes place during the holidays (end of the year). It cover cultural competency etc stuff like that. My agency rented out a movie theater at a fancy new entertainment place to show the training. Which is gonna be an hour and a half. And they said that's the short version! Its normally 4 and a half hour training, but this year they made it short (I came just in time!). Over 150 plus people or more that work for the agency and I will be seeing everyone from every campus in all the counties. Then, we will be doing team building skills, aka bowling or axe throwing I guess. We are getting paid for the whole day though. My therapist said on the bright side I am getting paid to bowl. I guess. I'd rather go home after the training. Oh well. I dont think anyone is particularly happy that they HAVE to bowl."
175981555,Epicness and well done. Great achievement and after all the hard work it must feel great

175981557,Im a hypochondriac. Ive been doing extremely well on lexapro 20 mg for the last 8 months. The increase to 20 mg happened in january 2019. Not recent. Ive had no major side effects since then. This agitation only appeared 29th 30th august 2019. After which i stopped for 4 days.
175981558,Neurotypicals do not Get It.
175981559,I feel all this unfocused energy I want to read all these books I have and write code and learn the mysteries of the universe and math and dance and drink. Everything except work.
175981560,"I have respect for anyone else's to do list as like my own. For me, my schedule was kind of like a thought exercise and an attempt to see how I do - Doing things that I don't feel like doing in the moment. Cuz I usually do what I feel like doing in the moment but it's not working - I end up not doing anything. It's ok to preserve the mental state as well by relaxing, trying to overcome mental illness etc. That's what I've been doing and I'm still doing that. I have a huge lack of understanding in rules, structure, education systems and how it all works. Some people work, make money online, get inheritance, some people rob banks. It's all good."
175981561,If everything goes well I’ll go to the art store as a reward for myself
174377025,"I think this way as well but if I was hearing or seeing things, I'd likely dismiss them as something apart of the illness. I don't ever think that there was a time that I thought my hallucinations were real except when I was on an overdose of clonazepam or psilacetin. Remember that psychosis often means that you have no insight and think that things are real which is apart of the illness - It doesn't really help to know that.. Idk.. I'm just telling you anyways. Much love"
175981562,I need a friend too
175981563,The key problem with Xanax is if you take it regularly you’ll need to increase the dose constantly to keep it effective. Pretty soon 1mg won’t work. Have you tried ACT therapy? It helps with uncomfortable feelings like anxiety.
175981564,"I keep them in my purse too. I had a panic attack in Walmart once and didn't have any on me. It was awful. I just need to know I have one incase I need it, usually I don't, but if I didn't have one, I would. I hope you can get what works best for you. I have never taken klonopin, but what I have read about them doesn't make me want to. The Xanax works for me. I know people abuse them, I don't understand why. All they do for me is take anxiety away or make it lesser, that is all I require. Have a good day!!! Best wishes... _PERSON_, _NAME_..."
175981565,Kind of got into a fight with my sister. She's mad at me. Anyway... I'm trying to fight this depression.. I feel so overwhelmed and Possible trigger: keep having a lot of suicidal thoughts

175981567,Yea I get that. I never grew up having to worry about money. Even living with my dad the past 10 years. I obviously can’t do shyt right. It’s very obvious.

175981569,Yes I feel like I have derelaization disorder. It sucks alonh with other stuff. Im screwed in this life
174377029,"I am grateful as I said for my job. It is a fun job!! I am meeting all kinds of people. I am exercising still but am not as disciplined about it. Sometimes, I feel tired then I rest. I have not met anybody since I came to my new country. I feel ok about it. It is better to be safe than sorry. I watch homeless documentaries when I can. It breaks my heart about the homeless, but I used to be one of them. I have been blessed to come this far in a short period of time. However, since I was homeless, I had a serious setback two years ago because I stopped my medication. Thus, I don't want to repeat history again. I report taking my medication daily to my father. He is happy I do this. I feel tired at times from it but have no major complaints because it has been helping me remain stable. Life is amazing! I've had my ups and downs. I have to say I've had more down periods than up periods. I'd like to change this. Ever since I've had psychosis, it has been a battle for me. But, the medication is really he
lpful these days. When I first became psychotic, I changed from rispedal to Zyprexa to Seroquel to Clozapine to Geodon to Abilify. Abilify, it is for me now. This medication helps but at times mild psychosis breaks through then I stop my medication. I have to remember when the symptoms come worse to see my doctor and take my medication faithfully. I was doing well for three years then decided the heck with it. But, I had a hard time with my parents this last time. They never allowed me to go out the house without them. It was like being in prison! I had enough of this, I thought. I need to become more responsible for myself or else, just check out of life. I decided to fight for my freedom!! And, I am free now!! I am free and working. I am healthy too!! I thank God for my life and the blessings!! I must say after two years of imprisonment, I was ready to check out, thank God, I did not. The man who befriended me is nice and supportive! He is good to me. But, as I said, we will remain just friends. Well, I hav
e to teach tonight. I have to teach this weekend too!! Life is swell."
175981570,Weather or not they're real... I feel like I'm in a horror virtual reality that I can't take off the helmet off or turn off the system... only way here is to turn off myself and I don't want to turn myself off.
175981571,"I am so sorry, hon."
175981572,Yes I can definitely do that!
175981573,"I'm so sorry _PERSON_ that that stuff's been going on. It's okay to feel your feelings, I think, in this case, because that's a lot of stuff. If you need anything just let us know. Glad you posted that because that can be a lot of stuff to just hold in. How are you feeling now?"
175981574,Thank you! I’m currently only on 12.5 mg but move up to 25 mg on Saturday. I hope my side effects don’t increase again
175981575,"CPS is on my roommates ***. It was originally for their son to help get him into school and appointments about his cleft pallet and a learning disorder and possibly autism.. Well we got screwed over. The parents were suppose to do parenting classes but they had to cancel classes because of covid. My friend had a meeting in court and we're gonna have someone come and from unknown time and can take all 3 of the kids away if they see something ""not right"" and try to take the kids away. FUUU I hate cps."
175981576,i think you need a teacher to teach you to meditate. this is how i learned and it does help but is difficult to do when in the throws of anxiety. problem with an ssri increase is it brings side effects during the transition and after your body adjusts to the new dose-you may not be able to go back to orig dose .
175981577,"Awe, that is so sweet. I am glad you are smiling. Feel free to start a thread if you would like to. If you would like to introduce yourself. I hope you have a lovely day today. Best wishes, Hugs, _NAME_... 12"
175981578,What kind of medicine is olanzepine Desoxyn? Is it a sleep medicine?
175981579,"Thanks I have a giant GB/GBC/GBA/DS/3DS collection as well. lol. As for the new switch: Yeah, the hardware specs aren't any different. It's just the increased battery life. What they NEEDED to fix was the sloooooooow charging. I know quick charge could overheat the device if you're playing a graphics intensive game like BotW, but it charges so. damn. slow. I mean, if I let the battery drain all the way by accident, it takes me an hour of charging before I can even turn it on. I know the 3DS is smaller, but you could at least turn it on even if the battery was dead, as long as you had it plugged in."
175981580,I get a shot and it does wonders. I am grateful for this convenience because I forget to take my medication when I'm psychotic.
175981581,I'm sorry for complaining lately. My anxiety hasn't been so bad for years I'll just do my best to get through the next few weeks and bring it up at my appointment

175981591,"I am beautifully bipolar and overweight and I love myself. It is easy to hate – to hate the jiggle of your belly, the fact that you would never imagine a gap in your thighs. Hate is easy. Love is a lot more complicated. The world feeds us this bullshit that you are not worthy of love and respect if you are “thick” or a “big girl” or, gasp, “fat.” I used to be part of the machine that creates this poison in my twenties. I worked in the fashion departments of magazines. I worked on seasons of New York Fashion Week. I styled some shoots in _NAME_. I helped make people like the current me feel bad about themselves and I am sad about that. But if you live with bipolar disorder chances you are overweight or obese. It is okay. You are in the majority with me. When we are depressed we do not really have an amazing amount of energy to make it to the gym. We are lucky to have the energy to shower. For some of us, depression makes us crave food. When you are eating more but not moving more, the 
pounds slide on. I wish I could tell you the secret to exercise motivation, but I have am at a loss. I have not one, but two, gym memberships and I still do not go. 75% of people living with bipolar disorder are overweight or obese. Not a very hopeful number to overcome. But it is possible. Diet and exercise help but there are other factors which make it hard. Many medications we take pack on the pounds. In the beginning I was prescribed a medication on which I gained twenty pounds in a month.

175981613,"Some people in our world find humor in watching neurotic people on TV, such as long time comedy actor _NAME_, or _NAME_ on the sitcom from the 1990s, Seinfeld. And a friend of mine who worried a great deal about little things liked to laugh at himself because of it. But being neurotic is nothing to be laughed at. Being neurotic is a very serious issue and can interfere with how happy you are in life. It's more difficult to be happy in life if you get all worried over every little thing. Take it from someone who knows. I used to be like that. However, with a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and setting as well as achieving realistic goals, I was able to overcome it.

175981651,"I am a 59-year-old woman who has never felt like I am good enough. On the outside, you would think I have nothing to complain about; my life looks good, but, on the inside, I feel like I am always trying to hide the fact that I'm not good enough. I was raised by a mother who never told me she loved me. She criticized me constantly, and, even when I was six-years-old, would give me the silent treatment when I did something wrong. She was cold and unforgiving. It is difficult to explain to those who had loving mothers how it makes you feel to think your mother doesn't love you unless you are perfect. She never had fun with us, and we all felt as if we were a burden to her. To this day, I am still trying to impress her, and she is 88. I got married when I was 19 to the first person who told me he loved me just to get out of the house, which was the wrong thing to do, I know. The man was five years older than I was and very nice, but not for me. I was divorced after a year. I went on to marry and divor
ce two more times, both to men who did not treat me well, but they told me they loved me in the beginning, and that's what I needed to hear. I am constantly trying to be perfect, in my looks, my house, my job, etc. If someone critiques me, I take it very personally and feel like a failure. I know the what and why of how I feel; I just don't know how to overcome it and be happy. I have had counseling, and it has taken three years to uncover the reasons for why I have made the choices I have made, and I am ready to work on making myself happy, not my mother. But, if I do overcome all of it, who would want me after I have been married three times? There are days when I feel crushed by the sadness I feel."

I do think that eventually things will get better. But the world has dramatically changed and it is what it is now. Jobs are so scarce and the economy really sucks now leaving so many people with mental health issues on top of money issues. The list could go on.

175981664,"hi, we can not live in a bubble. If you practice the right protocols, then nothing to fear.

A toolbox method we use, my toolbox, music, cold water on head, some use ice in hands. Distraction is key. You already know it passes, and that at certain times it is less problematic.

Nicotine increases this effect dramatically. The first time I chewed nicotine gum was when I stole it from a coworker when I was 17. I saw the most psychedelic visual of my life.

175981690,"Im fresh to this group however I am in a very similar situation to your wives rt now. _PERSON_ struggled with depression and etc since high school. Before the pandemic I had my career at a clinic, with coworkers and patients I loved. When it hit I quit in fear of contracting it and putting my parents lives at risk. Now ive had to go back to work. Same career unfortunately its with a different company and I HATE the clinic. Anyways I talk about myself only because lately since I started this new job my anxiety has been horrible. I sometimes sneak off to the back to fight back tears, try to calm my breathing, lower my heart rate and figure out how im going to push myself to go back out and work. My boyfriend unfortunately like you does not understand. I had a trigger come up a few months back and it started all of this. Now I feel lonely all the time. There are different reasons but the main one is bc I so desperately need my voice to be understood. Not judt heard but understood. I know others can ne
ver fully understand how we feel but it is possible to educate yourselves. Understand what can cause these emotions we have and how they make us feel. Honestly you getting on here searching for help to understand is alot more then most men would do and I commend you for that. My advice is to have a discussion with her. Not an argument but a discussion. Let her vent everything that shes feeling and has pent up inside of herself rt now. If she needs to yell let her. As far as the job I know how miserable she is. Dreading getting up and doing something you hate and causes you so much stress that its negatively impacting your mental health. Maybe compramise...encourage her to try and stay with it until she find another job. However if yall can financially afford it maybe be open to her quitting only if she feels it is to that point that if she doesn't shes going to loose it. Trust me struggling financially is hard I know but the negative impact that job can have on someone mentally and in turn physically which th
en causes so much anxiety and depression that it is putting a strain on a relationship well id rather be broke and struggle with the one I love that either of us have to suffer the impact that job will continue to have. Seriously though getting on here is a huge deal. What itd mean to me if my boyfriend did well itd mean more than anything else. Remember to hug her. Hugs are powerful. Remember to cuddle, to let her pick out a movie or a night thats all about what she wants to do bc we need that sometimes. Listen to her and ask questions. Communication can be really hard. If yall hit a barrier dont let it turn into an argument just explain you arent understanding and could she maybe try to explain it in another way. Just listen to her, understand her suffering is real. Let her know you are there for her. And never ever call her crazy, rediculous or a psycho."

I'm sick of people telling me what to do and controlling me. I want to be my own person. I blame it all on myself and not being able to stand up for myself - being in an addiction of avoiding people then doing psychedelics and now I'm not that way anymore but my brain is fried, why people like me and people that don't know me don't, the fact that my mom is an adult and gets to do whatever she wants and people giving advice to that to people like me - IT'S ALL ROBOTIC AND I CAN'T TRUST MYSELF, then the circle completes - I CAN'T DO THINGS TO GET OU

So maybe I'm delusional. I'm just pissed off at the people revving their engines and their egos. They should drive only on LSD. Possible trigger: I remember walking on the highway - I said ""I'll decide to walk in front of a truck after I walk on the highway"" so I looked at passing trucks and brushed up against them. Who would give a **** about looking both ways after dealing with this situation in their reality? I know exactly how bad it hurts to be hit by a car - More than I get imagine That one kid that got higher on some math tests than me at s
chool.. I saw him literally get hit by a slow moving car.. because he didn't look.. So don't tell me that people that don't look are stupid.. But I'm just gonna go ahead and say I'm an idiot worthless and deserve to die because I don't do what is common - Even when I know I look enough and the people driving in cars all they care about - ""Look at that idiot that didn't look"" HOw about you don't drive a car? No one asked to be here. Just run the idiots over."

175981773,"Yes, which is still bad if it happens fast. Even with those low estimates, he still is advocating that measures should be taken. Which means it is not a conspiracy, if the main guy of the task force in the US downplays it. Take the Hong Kong and Asian flu pandemics, and condense them into a few months, instead of a year or two, and it is relatively bigger in terms of impact. Mostly people in general seem to be overestimating the death ratio, and underestimating the spread rate. Like in his paper, he uses an R of 2.2, which is low, but consistent with what happened in China, arguably. It's a lot faster in Europe and North America. Not something people knew about March 16 when he published this. His current estimates are higher. Also, people like to point out the 0.1% death ratio for the flu, but that includes poor countries. In first world countries, the ratio of death from the flu is usually 10x lower. This can give a general idea. https://www.researchgate.net/publicatio ... f_COVID-19 They only di
agnosed 5 out of 1000 people in the US, so unless you know 200 people, chances are you won't know anybody that has it yet. It only really started a few months ago, give it a year. Plenty of people got it, but didn't realize it, or thought it was the flu, or had no symptoms. Hard to tell, but its an opinion. It's not a reason to deny reality. I do think some countries have reacted to fast and too strongly and are suffering for nothing, but they would need to act at some point. The last holdout is Sweden, which acted softly, but are reconsidering. Their economy still slowed down, it's not like it is business as usual. This being said, letting people die or simply killing them is usually good for the economy, if its the right people. Not so much anymore in a consumer economy, but people still have those ideas that only productive people help the economy. Now being a hero is staying home and consuming local. You can look at Europe with their negative interest rates. They pay good borrowers to borrow money. Like I 
said, it is a consumer economy and has been for awhile. This pandemic just shows it more, and proves the schizoid lifestyle was the moral one all along."

I'm guilty of letting people walk all over me because like the fool in the story, because I want to make people happy. The Fool - Fruitsbasket YouTube _PERSON_ has a point Once upon a time, there was a foolish traveler who had gone on a journey. Why was he foolish? Well, because he was fooled by everyone he met! ""Please, some money for medicine...?"" Everywhere he went, people made up all kinds of sad stories to tell him, and the traveler fell for every one of them. ""I have a sick younger sister..."" ""I don't have money to buy seeds to plant in my fields."" Pretty soon, his money, his clothes, even his shoes had been cheated away from him. But the foolish traveler was always glad to help. And he always told the people the same thing. He said: ""I wish you happiness."" But by this point, though, the traveler was completely naked, and with nothing left to cover himself, he decided to leave the main r
oad and travel through the dense forest, where no one could see him... But soon, he was discovered by the goblins that lived in the woods. The goblins wanted to eat the traveler's body, so they begged and pleaded, and used kind words to try and trick him... Of course, the traveler was fooled. First, he let the goblins eat one of his legs. Then an arm. Then more and more... Before it was over, all that the traveler had left was his head. He'd even given his eyes away to the last of the goblins... And as that last goblin was eating the traveler's eyes, he turned and said ""Thank you, traveler. In return, I leave you this present."" What the goblin left was a slip of paper, with the word ""fool"" written on it. The traveler couldn't see it. He didn't know what it was. Even so, tears began to flow down his face. ""Thank you,"" he said. ""This is the first present anyone ever gave me. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Thank you."" Even without his eyes, he cried and cried, great tears of joy. Then, the traveler died, th
e smile still on his face. see? loss, hardship, things like that? you can’t only focus on them. the traveler didn’t…he never thought about his own troubles at all. i imagine that it probably does sound really foolish to some people. but i don’t think he’s foolish at all. even though other people probably think he was being tricked? i don’t think he was. i think he did exactly what he wanted to do. i think, more than anything, he just wanted to make others happy."

175981806,"I've been slow on understanding and delayed with anything that involves any level of intelligent thought lately - most things don't, but this does. I've never understood how security was never a part of humanism. I'm not seeing reason which is part of why I was wondering. I'm thinking owning mistakes may be easier as a larger group than individually because they can shift amongst each other or point at the organization while easing into taking responsibility. I'm not sure if suddenly ""flipping"" to solidarity of a cause is the same thing as owning mistakes. I was also thinking of other animals that would serve as pigs - like wild boars or hyenas or tazmanian devils that don't even adhere to enforcing or creating a dictatorship. Ok that's making sense. I thought I already understood that humanists were a type of primate, but I didn't realize that individualism was principle rather than another type of primate. This is where my concern is, I think. They're operating as you explain, on a feudal level 
but getting rid of the system when, as you've said before, they need some type of dogs or shepherds. This makes me wonder if true humanists would become the sheepdogs or shepherds, but I'm doubtful because they're not keeping the pretenders on point currently and haven't been for a long time (I've already complained about this earlier in this thread). It's a $#%^ show. This clarifies some of what you mentioned earlier in our conversations, thank you. I'm trying to understand if this means kings or queens which you've also touched a little upon in past conversation. Idealized self clarifies what they're doing, but since very few are humanists and humanists aren't bothering to keep them in line it's a problem. I'm assuming idealized self was supposed to replace the need for fences too. I plan to think further to understand this My thinking is, pigs have eaten their farmers when the farmer collapsed - so it's only natural that they'd pose the same risk to any other primate that is weakened if not supervised prop
erly. It's just pigs being pigs - blaming them doesn't do much. It's those that are supposed to keep them within their pens that need to be targeted, but even then, if the goal is idealized self with false humanists not knowing where to focus because they don't care about reason... I'm not clear on a lot of this, so I wanted to think further. I do know my life would be and would have been a lot easier if I had the virtue of tolerance. I wish I could force myself to learn it or a replacement. I haven't gotten much chance to think on this, so I'm not sure if I understand but perhaps being capable of the aforementioned ""ultimate empathy"" means you shouldn't be asked to do anything that requires an imposition on freedom unless you come to that conclusion yourself. Maybe that's why social distancing works. Id like to think further on this For me, in real life interactions, I often feel like I'm too open/receptive to most others and it feels obnoxious and invasive and they try to engulf me which is why I hate str
angers in my personal space and I like social distance. This makes sense to me now. I would hate it. I'm not sure I agree that all ""being in love"" is about that, but I definitely see what you mean. I don't like groups, but I'm an idealist to a fair extent. As for being delusional, it's possible - but at least functional enough not to be institutionalized. Lol. Groups provide safety - the problem is not having one you can blend into. For example, me. Too ""immoral"" and odd to not upset the white sheep. Too ""moral"" to not upset the the black sheep.

175981812,My T suggested at my last appointment that I keep a calendar with smiling faces for good days and frowning faces for bad days. I guess the point is to see that depression doesn't last forever. Right now I have six days with frowning faces. It's depressing. Does anyone else do something like this? Is it at all helpful?

174377385,"I don't like my therapist. We aren't compatible. She just sees me as the illness rather than a person. I asked her to make an appointment with her for once a week and make an appointment with my psychiatrist and she says ""Why? Can't you just talk to your doctor?"". Well.. My doctor doesn't deal with my Invega injection. Only my psychiatrist does. I wrote down questions to ask my psychiatrist and I just want to have an honest talk with her which includes maybe lowering the Invega injection to 100mg or switching to a different antipsychotic. My psychiatrist makes me feel like I'm being defiant or manipulative to find a way to lower my injection without any reason. It makes me feel completely trapped. And I can't talk to my family about this because they think I'll go psychotic if I lower the injection. They just see the illness too and don't trust me. Everything I say can't be trusted. I’m not that good at articulating so this could all go against me and I have no one on my side. Here's some notes 
that I wrote down to prepare for my psychiatrist session; ""I’m doing much better and my mom has breast cancer so I’ve been thinking a lot.. Thinking about my future. Listening to podcasts about self improvement and it’s crazy how hard I’ve been working on myself. Making SMART goals like I was taught in the independent living unit, learning from my uncomfortable feelings and just in general being really aware of myself. This might not surprise you, but I think I have a mild form of autism. My IQ is somewhat high - Or it used to be high but the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and sleeping caused a lack in neuroplasticity along with the high dose antipsychotic medication. But there’s ways to increase types of intelligence by reading, exercising, etc.. It’s just that, when I do those things, I can only do them for so long before I have to lay down and do nothing but just think (Not even sleeping). My mind just gets fatigue and burn out from doing the slightest tasks. I’m sure that I’m not depr
essed and it’s a possibility that I have schizophrenia but after psychedelics, I realize that reality and outside reality is exactly as crazy as I thought it to be. And I’m at peace with that. I understand the questions that I’ve been asking and became more philosophical. My OCD has been cured. I’m a really really empathetic person but I feel like the injection is numbing that feeling. Maybe all I need is 3mg of an Invega pill in the morning or something. All I am is being completely honest like I’ve always been but I think the psychiatrist that diagnosed me with schizophrenia just didn’t understand me and my psychosis (If you can call it that) was caused by stress from my step dad - Manipulating my whole family, beating my mom and attacking me, controlling my mind."""

I have since moved and attempted to get some therapy as I have issues other then my illness to deal with, but have dumped all of them and find it easier to find support from people who have and are going through it as opposed to some onlooker. The thing I hate is the waiting game. Like when they ask you a question and you answer and they just wait hoping you will keep talking. I just sit there in silence until it becomes really awkward. Then I dump them."

175981863,It’s hard to tell without consulting a professional tbh. Some things like hearing voices have been found in a substantial number of teens and they just grow out of it. I believe it’s like 17%. This is much higher than the percentage of people with psychosis. Is it true psychosis or just a phase of growth the way that it’s normal for a kid to believe in Santa? At any rate I wouldn’t be quick to label yourself as anything.....worry about it if it happens again....then see a psychiatrist....

175981872,"There’s more to forensic psychiatry than the medical model. There’s psychoanalysis of course. A psychopath who isn’t antisocial (they do exist) is still a psychopath, but your much beloved descriptive psychiatry is not detecting them, while it erroneously lumps heterogeneous people based on external behaviors that have different intrapsychic meanings, potentially failing the first and most important step in treatment: correctly identify the diagnosis. Like I said, it’s technically possible for a serial killer to be neither antisocial nor psychopathic - like _PERSON_ - but they are exceptions. Some are are highly narcissistic, but the vast majority have ASPD or full-blown psychopathy. It doesn’t mean they can’t be schizoid or borderline too. But unlike psychopathy or schizoid PD, BPD in a serial killer won’t be a major psychopathological factor, apparently. Serial murder has to be the most antisocial thing someone can do, yet you still struggle with the notion that they are most likely 
at least ASPD. Go figure. Also why you give full credit to some internet articles but you can’t trust that the leading expert on psychopathic behavior knows what he’s talking about is another baffling question. You don’t need an official diagnosis to see that _PERSON_ was schizoid for the same reason that you don’t need a meteorologist to notice that the sky is blue. But don’t stop there and read more about him. Unless you don’t trust yourself… Finally, I have no idea where you got the idea that schizoid is not part of BPO."

175981879,"Hello! And thank you so much for responding. Well what he did was, spend a night with me and than told me he loved and needed me. Which was the first time I heard that from him. Than, he just blocked me five days later and was seeing someone else. Who (not to sound shallow) isn't as physically attractive as me, but seems to have more money than me as well as seems to be a partier, while I'm more of a introvert person. I got a message from his account saying that I'm pathetic and dumb for thinking he would wanna talk to me and he wants nothing to do with me. It stated that it was his girlfriend who said that to me. It's neither hear nor there, but it could have just been him or it could have been her. I feel almost blessed to have gotten out of this situation with this guy, but what I'm dealing with now is the flashbacks of bad and good times and shaking off the feelings of hurt that wash over me sometimes.

175981891,I imagine if we are really humans but our thoughts come from somewhere else and we just say they come from our brains because we have eyes and can see around us and we are inside bodies and we could possibly program our bodies into robots connected to virtual reality - Or we're transmitted through alien computers from another dimension. Any object could be anything. But don't listen to me it's all psychotic stuff about reality but U and I? We are the same. On antipsychotics to stop this type of thinking .. But do we misinterpret it with the flaws of language? Using letters; Language is; - Syntax (The rules that allow us to assemble words into phrases and sentences) - Morphology (The rules that allow us to assemble bits of words like prefixes and suffixes into complex words) - Phenology (The rules that allow us to combine vowels and continents into complex words) I learned this in the anthropology class.

175981923,"vkj: As a bipolar, I had a psychotic episode at 17, so that was probably an early sign of that. Wasn't on meds until about 28 when I had some sort of emotional collapse, perhaps a mental breakdown, and was put on an anti-psychotic which was like torture and I didn't know if it was the medicine causing the mental confusion and turmoil, or if that was the mental illness from the mental breakdown. I was on that off and on for about a year. Went in as depressed to a new psychiatrist, who dxed me as depressed, when I was really bipolar, and the anti-depressant (Sinaquan tricyclic) alone, with no stabilizer like Lithium which I'm on now, would give me panic attacks.

175981924,"This: it's non-stop, I wake up thinking lots of weird stuff at a fast pace and it's annoying. Exactly the same for me. And many many other people who knows or fear that their thoughts are being heard. It all comes down to fear of rejection/being portrayed as a weirdo/psycho/crazy person. And ofc its a very VERY unpleasant feeling. But! Think like this: we're already rejected from this society. The day we got psychosis, that day is also the day we got rejected. They wanted us to know they're hearing our thoughts and that they're observing us 24/7. They have done it all our lives. So They know you inside out. They know how you react to certain stimuli, they know how you think in general, etc.. And lastly, they know you're not a threat. The last part is important. What ever ###$ up thoughts you think in a ocd'ish type of way(just like i do) they will act on it just to make you feel down BUT they know your PROFILE so dont worry. They wont do $#%^. The only thing thell do is fake cough and bla bla but t
hats just laughable, _USER_ID_ about anymore. What im trying to say is what ever you think they think about you(that youre horrible/crazy/weirdo) that doesnt mean a single $#%^! You have to believe in your own goodness. As long as you believe in it and you know deep inside your good(despite having ###$ up thoughts all the time) then what they're thinking about you, does not matter at all! What are/were your interests prior to the psychosis? Im sure you can have a much better life than what you think you can. I have had very low dips but now im ok. what would make you happy(except for rewinding and for this to never had happend in the first place)?"

175981954,"And after the birds and I finished with our marching and torch waving, we came back inside and sat down and enjoyed some _PERSON_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIbN4z4AeGI _PERSON_ is the greatest _PERSON_ pianist to ever live. I don't care what anyone says, yes, there have been a lot of great _PERSON_ pianists, such as _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ (the second best), _PERSON_, but _PERSON_ had an almost supernatural sound to his playing. It all depends on what you're looking for when you listen to _PERSON_ piano sonatas. Do you want drab and gray, or do you want lively and colorful? _PERSON_ is amongst the greatest to ever live because he had such as happy sound to everything he played. He made it his own. He didn't just read the sheet music and play it like a robot, he added flair and personality to it, and what a likable personality it was. He could take the dreariest, melancholic piece and bring the sun and the bright blue sky out with it. Then you have someone like _PERSON_, who in terms of p
ure, raw skill is probably the best pianist to ever live in my opinion, but he played with that dark, doom and gloom tone. The biggest ""doom and gloom"" piece for solo piano is _PERSON_ Piano Sonata in B minor. This is the piece the classical and baroque era purists go to when they say ""this is why I don't like the romantic era! It's not because I haven't been able to wipe my own ass in ten years, it's because it's so dark and depressing!"" It's a lovely piece, _PERSON_ was a master of the piano, literally if you play everything he composed for solo piano, non-stop, it would play for over 24 hours. The man transcribed _PERSON_ nine symphonies for piano, and it did every last one of them justice. Some guy transcribed _PERSON_ piano sonata in B minor to solo violin and it's awful sounding. You can't take such a complex piece and transcribe it to a single string instrument. An entire orchestra would have been better, or a string orchestra, or hell, even a string quartet, but a solo violin? It's disgusting soun
ding. Where was I? Oh, yeah, yolo swag money!"

175981961,"Well, that is a world of information. I thought we were going to be climbing Mt. Everest to get her to a psychiatrist, and then another obstacle to get her on Lithium or some other stabilizer. But you say she already goes to a psychiatrist and has taken Lithium.That is wonderful. But then I'm wondering why she hasn't calmed down? You said, ""Just a few minutes ago, she's yelling and swearing at her child. She and I spend a lot of time talking about how he shouldn't be in environments he's in. She's recently divorced and living at home. Her mother does much of the same thing, which in turn, upsets her. His dad lets the kid get away with whatever and it frustrates her when he doesn't listen. He's not my son, but she and I have differing views on discipline. ""She also makes comments about not wanting to be alive anymore relatively often. I don't know what to say to that. Seldom do I say the right thing. I often get a, ""That's not helpful."" I don't want to be alive either, really, but I'm not allowe
d to make such comments, so it's an odd double standard. My depression is pretty bad and most days feel like a waste, but that's another story."" Have you ever been to a psychiatrist for your depression? How about, one problem at a time, and be positive about that problem? How did the Lithium affect her, and did she take an anti-depressant at the same time? Since bipolar is 2 illnesses, mania and depression. Could you find that out? What is she taking now? Is she still going to the psychiatrist? Do you think you're going to solve this, since what's going on in your mind can have a large affect on the outcome? Again, as a bipolar, I take Lithium for my mania and Mirtazapine anti-depressant for my depression."

175981966,"Hi!! I have lots and lots of diagnosis's that have caused me to have chronic pain every day. I've had 17 hours straight of excruciating pain. I know what you are going through. The best way I've found is this: When my pain gets severe or is the kind to stick around, I ask my fiance to rub my arm or something. By his rubbing his hand softly on my arm, my brain can now focus on a the good feeling of his touch instead of the horrible pain. It normally doesn't take more than maybe a half hour for the pain to go away. It's amazing how the brain works. By concentrating on the good feeling the brain is no longer thinking of the pain. The longer it can concentrate on a good feeling the less it's recognizing the pain. If this is done long enough eventually your pain goes away. I hope this helps you. _NAME_"
175981967,"Sorry you’re feeling bad, for me my T had me write out five self care things I could do while at work...ie things like smelling an essential oil or feeling a piece of velvet kept in my pocket or whatever. Small things that help."

175981983,I hit my shin hard on our bench in our kitchen this morning. I almost fell into the cabinets but I didn't. My shin still hurts though. I wonder if it is bruised.
175981984,"Yeah I've been up all night, not tired"
175981985,"I was told from a Dr that I was spot on panic attacks for sure. But, I'll start from the beginning, I'd love to get other patients' input on things - not that I don't trust my Dr, but I wonder if they have 1 diagnosis, do they stop looking for other things in the mental health world? And the Dr that diagnosed my panic attacks is not the Dr that I am currently seeing. So maybe he just went along with the original diagnosis. In my early 20s, I started having panic attacks, they started suddenly. By the book description too. That sudden electric feeling in the stomach. The tingly through my arms and legs, up the back of my neck to my brain. Racing thoughts always circling around doom and death. The thoughts start small and then grow to leading to demise. I rock back and forth, I want to cry but it's like there is too much terror in my brain to even have the ability to cry. I come from a family who does not discuss mental health. I was suddenly the black sheep bc I was spiralling out of control and had 
no one to talk to no one to relate to this and no one was or even is willing to educate themselves on mental health. When the attacks first started on more than 1 occasion, the doctor's attempted to hospitlize me but my parents talked them out of it. I don't feel like I have extreme mania or extreme depression. I do have a tendency to get super passionate about a project or a hobby and then with in a few days, lose all interest in it. People say I wash my hands excessively. I have control issues and trust issues. Sometimes I get angry over the most trivial thing and the response I have is extreme. It use to be worse when I was in my 20s. If I would get in an argument with my parents, I'd trade my car in, change my phone number, not talk to anyone in my family for weeks or months sometimes. Now in my late 30s, if my husband doesn't do something that I ask him to or if something I'm trying to do doesn't go my way, I usually end up crying and yelling and throwing things away. Here's an example... I wanted a shel
f above my kitchen sink. My original plan didnt work. I thought of another way to put the shelf up but it wasn't working and my husband said why are you working so hard for a shelf, just forget it. And I started to cry and shake and ripped it down and threw it away and didn't talk to him for the rest of the day. I knew it was an extreme response later but in the moment I was so upset I didn't think. I get antsy while waiting. Whether I'm waiting in the drive thru at fast food or waiting for someone to grab something at the store. If things don't move at my pace, and my pace is very fast, then I get agitated. I always figured that was related to my control issues but maybe someone here can relate and give me direction."

He didn't seem terribly concerned by it but nonetheless sent it in because its appearance. He expects that it will be mild to moderate dysplastic.

In short, YES I EXPERIENCE THIS TOO, but i'm 44 years old and had this since about age 20 and have had a long time to reflect on some basic logic (I grew up a programmer by hobby and studied computer science which is basically a logical science - when you write code you write logic). -- Sat Jul 20, 2019 9:03 pm -- My reply was in regard to this

175982018,"I find that my mind looks for things to worry about. It's like I can't enjoy and live in the moment. If there is nothing going on, I start to ruminate on past events or worry that I made a mistake in the past which will effect me in the future. I constantly have 'what if' thoughts. Some days or better than others, but I feel like I can't help the 'what if thought' and then catastrophize things. Intellectually, I know worry over things won't help, but emotionally I feel like I can't help it. I've been doing mediation and ASMR and it helps only so much. Does anyone else experience this?"

175982020,"yes, that too. It reminds me of that _NAME_ quote: 'Mr. _PERSON_ lived a short distance from his body.' You live a short distance from your emotions? You're welcome. I just read where _NAME_ thanked you for your meditation suggestion. Aren't we just the helpful bunch here right now? doubt _PERSON_ would agree though re me"

175982022,"People with celiac disease are 17 times more likely to have bipolar disorder than those without celiac. I had gut problems for decades. I thought it was normal to feel like crap after I ate. Then I was diagnosed with celiac disease and my life completely changed. I feel great since eliminating gluten from my diet. I have more energy, I’m not sick all the time and I’m less moody. The moody part really intrigued me, so I looked into how celiac and bipolar relate. It turns out there is a strong association between the two diseases. Also, comorbidity with a mood disorder is a key indicator in measuring quality of life in individuals with celiac disease. 1 -2% of the population has celiac disease. In this group 4.3% are diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In the research cited, in the non-celiac control group only .4% had bipolar disorder. There’s growing evidence that autoimmune disorders and bipolar disorder are closely associated. Celiac disease increases immune activation, which is hypothesized t

175982025,"Trauma is a peculiar animal and it is hard to say what triggered your recall. It could be related to aspects of your accident, now being confined in a way that stresses out that trauma-part of your brain thinking you are not able to get away or be safe. A good resource to educate ourselves on the aspects, and potential solutions, of trauma is a book called ""The Body Keeps the Score"". It was written by Dr. _NAME_ (sp?) who is the grandfather of trauma-informed care and one of the creators of the ACE score which measures the impact of childhood trauma. It is a weighty book and can also be gotten as an audiobook which I found easier to take in when I stalled out reading during chapter 4. The last part of the book discusses how to address the trauma and resolve it. I think you will find some really useful information about childhood and other traumas and the resulting PTSD situations."
175982026,"I'm fine today. Just trying not to compare myself to others too much. It's hard. I wish I didn't live with my parents and was financially independent from them, etc. I wish a lot of things. I guess it takes baby steps to accomplish that but it sucks not being there yet. I want to move out and things like that. Wish there wasn't a pandemic, too. Just feels so boring where I live. Anyway, at least I got a job doing something. That will at least occupy some of my time."

175982029,"I feel considerably better after taking olanzapine for a few days. I guess that stuff really works. It helps with my illogical beliefs and thoughts and paranoia and other symptoms I was having. Such as changing my mind constantly. I think meds do work to a certain extent. I know I can do things to influence my mood positively, and I have trouble doing that sometimes, but I like trying to do something positive for myself in that regard. Like today I just sat and listened to music for a while. I have a record player so I like using that. I also think meds aren't everything. I think for me, I have to institute other things in my life to be happy. Like meaningful stuff. Like intellectual curiosity, for me, is important. And music and stuff like that. Writing, too."
175982030,"Thank you for responding, yeah it is similar I was 3 pounds when I was born due to my mother crack addiction, I wasn’t supposed to make it. I’m a big believer in god and the power he has but I’m with you sometimes I don’t think I should exist and I don’t even want to exist. Why would you when your going through this pain you feel like no one else understands or could even care about. It’s tough being around our age because everyone expects you to start being that adult 9-5 till the day you retire which is fine cause that’s how you make the money, but what if idk exactly what I want to do. I’m not lazy at all I’m far from it I just don’t wanna make the same mistake I’ve seen 100 times before so. It’s just a battle everyday for me sometimes I just get depressed out of no where and lay in bed and cry."
175982031,"I think you should give the medication a try. As long as it is being administered by a professional of course. I went through a period of chronic fatigue 9 years ago after a viral infection. It did something to my central nervous system, and caused me to cut back at work and such. My doctor gave me adderall which made a world of difference for me at that time. I was able to go back to work FT and have at least some social life. After 3 years it basically went away. But my point is that the medication in this case enhanced my quality of life a lot. Without it things would have been tougher and also harder for me to cope with mentally. Just my 2.5 cents here."

175982033,wow I've never find the board this active after 9pm before
175982034,I see my psychiatrist tomorrow and I have no idea what to say. Maybe I should stay on the same meds. Maybe I should lower the injection but the psychedelics showed me the truth to reality. Everything I've been psychotic about is real.

175982046,"Medications.. They're chemicals.. We are chemicals.. sometimes our chemicals can be imbalanced.. All these psychiatric meds can help people that have been damaged from psychosis and mania or inducing drugs.. or when the neurotransmitters are just squeezed out, depression. Meds are like anti-drugs. The antidote. So stopping them would be like wanting to take drugs to make you feel better.. or normal.. many take drugs to feel normal.. and other times, to get high.. But the point is this.. which ever wave of the drug-light spectrum paradox, we're never normal.. no one is.. And if you feel better on meds, you want to stop them because who wants to take meds? No one. Only a crazy person.. Who has to take meds? Well.. someone that needs them.. The point where you decided that you needed them could outweigh any irrational effects that you feel when you're stabilized to give proof.. or not? It's so ****ing hard to distinguish what is real when the illness is about losing touch with reality.. because what i
s reality? Subjective is all you know.. but objectively, others can give a different perspective.. but only you know yourself best - No one else.. A psychiatrist can be right.. but then again, you have to think, what is a psychiatrist? They use rules based on objective research.. it all contradicts, especially with spirituality.. or just a summary of it, ruled by government and culture.. culture is really what determines who is sane.. many people speak different languages.. and then you think about science.. who's making the vaccines for example? God? It's an excuse for not going in deeper.. And sometimes you just think so deeply that you get cognitive fatigue and stress that you want it all to stop.. people judge you for not keeping it together when we're all really crazy and going down this rabbit hole.. sometimes you just need a break, to sleep.. be sedated on antipsychotics.. decrease every single chemical completely.. but when it's all gone, BOOM, everything happens.. So you have to take this into consid
eration.. it's ok to go off meds for a little bit only after you have lowered the dose.. you don't just jump off the cliff and think you can walk in the valley without falling.."
174377696,I’m surprised that they’ve not tried topicals ap’s like haldol or other older meds. I’ve had been on a lot of different antipsychotics. I’m now on clozapine. I’ve not been on it long enough or probably a high enough dosage for it to work it’s magic.. that and they also have me on the Rexulti. Our brains are different so who knows what would work.

175982058,I go through episodes of depression where I think about times where I think the world is against me. Something that really helps is to just cry until you can’t cry anymore. Then if you want to tale it a step further you should invest in a pet. Preferably a dog because it can be like a therapy dog. It is important to create a connection with someone close to you. They become the only thing that makes you happy. I find it to be very helpful.
174377704,"Hi, TunedOut! I couldn't do the YouTube, so I googled _NAME_ re: schizophrenia. I found forums & articles, very interesting. I will explore all that further when I can. I believe many brains (if not all) are capable of creating endless amounts of things, & that the so-called conscious mind is separate from the rest of the brain & geared mainly for the outside world. And in my case, some other area of my brain has figured out how to talk to the conscious mind, or has created extra minds that can do that."

A person with dysarthria may also have problems controlling the pitch, loudness, rhythm, and voice qualities of his or her speech. Dysarthria is caused by paralysis, weakness, or inability to coordinate the muscles of the mouth. Dysarthria can occur as a developmental disability. It may be a sign of a neuromuscular disorder such as cerebral palsy or Parkinson's disease. It may also be caused by a stroke, brain injury, or brain tumor. Treatment of dysarthria includes intensive speech therapy with a focus on oral-motor skill development.""

175982105,"Bipolar Disorder and Celiac Disease People with celiac disease are 17 times more likely to have bipolar disorder than those without celiac. I had gut problems for decades. I thought it was normal to feel like crap after I ate . Then I was diagnosed with celiac disease and my life completely changed. I feel great since eliminating gluten from my diet. I have more energy, I’m not sick all the time and I’m less moody. The moody part really intrigued me, so I looked into how celiac and bipolar relate. It turns out there is a strong association between the two diseases. Also, comorbidity with a mood disorder is a key indicator in measuring quality of life in individuals with celiac disease. 1 -2% of the population has celiac disease. In this group 4.3% are diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In the research cited, in the non-celiac control group only .4% had bipolar disorder. There’s growing evidence that autoimmune disorders and bipolar disorder are closely associated. Celiac disease increases immun
e activation, which is hypothesized to act as an important factor in the onset of bipolar disorder. The metabolic explanation is that malabsorption of tryptophan leads to a decreased central serotonin synthesis. Also, cytokines common in celiac may exert an effect on the brain circuits related to mood regulation. The researchers won’t go as far as to say that celiac disease causes bipolar disorder, but they do surmise that in people with a vulnerability to bipolar, there is a risk that celiac triggers the mood disorder. The study also noted the profound impact the two disease’s co-occurrence can have on quality of life (QOL). “The results show, surprisingly, that in the absence of psychiatric illness people with celiac disease do not have an impaired QOL compared to the people who do not suffer from celiac disease. But when measuring the burden suffered by people with celiac disease comorbid with mood disorders, the “dual diagnosis”… lowers the quality of life in the same manner as serious chronic 
diseases.” In fact, the study suggests that the negative impact on QOL in people with celiac disease and bipolar disorder is second only to that of people with bipolar and MS. I know my life has vastly improved since my diagnosis of celiac disease. Small inconveniences such as difficulties in restaurants pale in comparison to the violent mood swings and intestinal distress I suffered before and have since largely disappeared since I changed my diet. Please understand, though, that my bipolar disorder is still medically treated as it was before I knew I had celiac disease. Removing gluten from my diet has not led to the removal of my psych meds. My bipolar disorder is not cured. I just feel a lot better. In concluding their study, the researchers suggest r it is advisable to perform an adequate screening for celiac disease on all the people with bipolar disorder that show some key symptoms or have a family history of celiac disease. And everyone diagnosed with celiac disease should be screened for a mood dis

175982106,"I'm a bicyclist. Ever since last month's accident near Las Vegas in which a truck plowed into a group of 20 cyclists, killing 5, my anxiety has risen and it's difficult to stop thinking about it. This has happened to me before. As a cyclist, I've done everything I can control, and am a 100% attentive, defensive and abide by all rules of the road. I was hit by a driver as a kid, and landed in the hospital for a week, but thankfully don't remember anything. I've had motorists throw things at me, etc. With all the distracted driving going on, I know I take a chance riding my bike. I stay on roads with designated bike lanes or on trails that are reserved for non-motor-vehicle traffic."
