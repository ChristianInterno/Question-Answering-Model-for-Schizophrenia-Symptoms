Time travel is impossible, it’s a paradox. Everything’s happening even if you can’t see it. The better question is in a million years when everything’s quiet, will trees that fall make a sound? And if so who will care? And are there weird wompy creatures with all kinds of doo dads on their arms and 50 eyes living on a similar planet a bajillion light years away? Probably. I doubt it will affect us though."
176133012,I never thought I looked good either. Still don’t.

If I understood correctly that delusion is what got you into trouble in the first place, and even if granting that you may have lied or exaggerated about other symptoms it is your real delusion what brought you to the attention of the doctors.

176133017,I got into some legal trouble and face possible jail time but I won’t know until September. I violated a restraining order but I’m a first-time offender so I hope I only get probation and/or community service. Until then I AM making plans for someone to take care of my dog and apartment if I do go to jail…even then the public defender doubts I’d get more than 30 days. So I just don’t know right now. On a good note it’s been almost 3 months since I’ve been in the hospital.

I’m not sure if it’d make the difference It’s like, naltrexone has weight loss properties too and I think the root of it is how it changes the gastrointestinal system a bit. And this is what it does Usually it’s a short term assistance for alcoholism/addiction but this med has done wonders for my mood, psychosis and anxiety so my doctor keeps me on it. I’m just hoping this isn’t an issue. Forever it was more important to take naltrexone than anything. Now I’ve made a big recovery I gotta access the side effects now. I hope to stay on it forever."

Since I almost had a depressive psychotic episode I took two abilify’s and now I don’t think I should take anything anymore. I’m so unhappy with this situation but I’m like…feeling kind of like “euphoric” and Idk, different. I also keep thinking “I want to die” it keeps coming into my head. I told my case worker twice, I left a voicemail on the crisis line. They said its normal that since I’m withdrawing from stimulants that Im going through a bunch of emotions."
176133049,Mine was always sz or sza. One doctor tried doing the whole re diagnosis thing as bipolar then decided against it. Not sure if it was a get me off benefits thing (as he felt it was his job) or just a bad doctor. I made the mistake I told him I was taking CS50 from Harvard online and I guess that set the mood from there-on. He felt I was smart and could work probably. Then gave me a bunch of stats like 50% of bipolar people can work and about 15% of schizophrenics can work like I was one of them and could do that. Wouldn’t give me adderall though! Got me a 3 year review instead of 5 year review and had the worst bed side manner of any doctor I ever had.
176133050,The isolation room in the last hospital I was in was so much nicer than the one in the first hospital I was in. The lighting and energy in the room was warm and it did not stink and it was a larger room and there was a mattress. Hopefully they have improved in that first hospital and will improve in other hospitals. One is scared enough as it is. Such a thing as lighting is actually relevant and can matter a lot.

174375977,"Abilify did nothing for me in anyway, I was anxious and psychotic on it. I’ve come to realize it doesn’t really matter what others say about a particular drug, What I suggest to anybody that asks is to study the drug so you know all possible side effects and benefits, but the only way to know how it will affect you is for you to try it."

I have to have blood drawn before I meet with her again I dread that I hate giving blood and them feeling around on my arms to stick me makes it worse. I threw up once when I went by myself to give blood I always have my mom with me she snaps me out of that thought process and I don’t get sick when she is with me. Also I have been busy I got my car paid for got the title, registration, And License all put in my name and as well as car insurance. It was all in my parents name before now its my responsibility. Also when I get more funds in my account I will have the gym membership also put in my name on my own account. This is a big deal for me to now finally establish some of my own credit. I am anxious also excited about this. That I met some of my goals that I wanted to meet have been met now. The Only big purchas

176133066,Bingo. It absolutely is. Diet isn’t going to help ONE person on this website and may encourage them to go off meds. You should keep your whacky pseudoscience theories to yourself. There’s a lot of vulnerable on this site. If even one of them falls for your pseudoscience then you’ve caused a lot of harm. You’re delusional. You believe pseudoscience and try to spread it in as a convincing manner as possible. You need to get a grip. You try to act like an expert and you’re anything but.

176133072,But we haven’t had a memorial for him yet! Is part of why we grieve so we know these people are gone and won’t be coming around anymore?

176133086,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_ ! When my pdoc first suggested switching to Zyprexa, the first fear to come to mind was the associated weight gain. I agreed to try it despite that, with the intention of calorie cutting from day one. The way I figure it, I have to eat anyway, I might as well be doing everything I can to lose instead of gain. Put enough good decisions together and you have weight loss! It’s not even that hard for me anymore, I’m used to it. Usually when I make my menus a week in advance, I have to add calories rather than subtract them. Sparkpeople gives me a running total as I log stuff. I eat a lot of the same meals and things like granola bars, so I am used to how to balance it. I’ve been doing it since mid-March and have learned a lot."

176133093,He knows I am not much aroused and I downplay it. And I do enjoy cuddles so I don’t think it bothers him too much. I don’t share with him the extent of my disgust of my female parts (vaginas - yuck!) and he has to remind me he doesn’t like very short hair on women.

174375986,"I question whether I have schizophrenia too. But I think back to how I was in 2008 when I was unmedicated, I must have it. Also a couple of years ago when I was on Risperdal, I started hearing a voice again. My pdoc upped the dosage of the Risperidone and the voice went away. While on Zyprexa I would hear angels sing when I was trying to go to sleep. I got up and went in the livingroom and they went away. I thought maybe the neighbor was playing a radio."

I just want to have a bigger role in my sons life again and be taken seriously as his mum. I have moments of fear still, but im not a danger to him. They just kind of micromanage how i deal with him. They did that with me as i grew up too until i moved to the other side of the country to be away. I will try and show and also put pressure for change."

176133120,"Could you explain the logic of this argument? Also, it has been shown in humans too. I think denying meds have problematic effects makes no sense, if you know enough information. Which is why they should only be used as last resort. Sometimes damage without meds is bigger though."

176133150,"To be honest, I lost my applied intelligence when school got boring and I used to skip classes, and eventually never went back in them - favouring drug taking. This started at a very young age. It was noted in my Autism Assessment that in primary school they thought the work wasn’t challenging enough and they needed to stretch me to prevent me becoming disruptive. One teacher at high school who took an interest in helping me said I had the intelligence, but I was choosing not to use it. As soon as I finished school everything came crashing down with psychosis, and problems with the law. After I dealt with all that I did a highly creative but less than mentally taxing job for 8 years. I then tried to access my intelligence again by going back to college, and using my mind eventually lead to burn out and stress that led to more psychosis and being diagnosed as SZ. I did graduate still with a 2:1, but would have been a 1st if my mind was engaged in the course in the final year. Over the last 6 years 
I have been bouncing between relapses whilst working and developing into a highly skilled and creative IT job. It used to be supportive, and they used to allow me to work in my own way as they were getting good quality work from me, even if I was a bit odd. Once that safety net fell apart last July, things went to ???? again. I am now open to new opportunities for the first time in a long time, and it’s kinda scary. Sorry for the long story, but this intelligence question is very complicated for me, as I have some ability, but teasing it out of me has been a challenge for all the people in my life who have been trying hard to support me. I thank all the people who tried and failed. Now I just think I have enough wit and application to get by. TLDR???; SZ never took my intelligence away. It was like putting my brain into hyper-drive when I was psychotic, and my hands came off the steering wheel. I am sure it has broken a few parts of my mind, but it’s yet to finish me off."

174376004,"A study recently published in Psychiatry Research has shown schizophrenia to have high diagnostic stability over time. However, the majority of the research has focused primarily on early psychotic episodes. This systematic review included 39 studies performed between 1980 and 2017, which were largely sourced from the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health database PubMed.gov . Eligibility criteria included the availability of information regarding diagnostic stability of schizophrenia, participant age of at least 15 years, specific International Classification of Diseases Ninth Edition and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (III, IV, and V) diagnoses of schizophrenia and psychoses, a sample size larger than 10, and publications in peer-reviewed journals. Of the studies included, 23 focused on psychotic episodes, 11 on general psychiatric disorders, and 5 on schizophrenia, with 69.23% (n=27) of studies having a prospective design.

176133204,Hello _AT_MENTION_ Welcome to the forum!
176133205,"The rules can be confusing. I first went on SSDI in the eighties. I was also somehow on SSI. I dropped SSI somewhere down the line but I don’t even know the year. I’ve been through 9 month work trials, and a 14 month work trial. Were talking about over thirty years of collecting benefits and being employed at the same time. My jobs change, I quit or get fired or just walk out and never go back or don’t report for 3 days and never call and they let me go. But I’ve also succeeded at some jobs and last three or four years! My employment record is kind of spotty and checkered but overall, I’m usually a good employee. I’ve been working over 30 years and collecting benefits but I don’t know for sure how SSDI works or how I get it for so long. But I’ve been through multiple trial work periods and annual reviews by Social Security and they have a record of all my jobs and exactly how much money I made over the years and of course they can pull up at their leisure the record of how much SSDI 
I have collected. They make the rules not me, lol. So the ball is in their court. The last dealings I had with them was about 7 years ago and this is how it ended up. This is what my situation is. And I have checked and double checked and asked questions and asked specifics. And you may not believe it but this is what I’ve been told and like I said, I’ve double checked this and this is how it’s worked since 2011. A couple of workers told me that I can work and earn up tp about $1200 a month. You mentioned the abbreviation “SGA” There’s a name for the amount they let you earn but it escapes me. But it is something that other people get too, not just me. Basically, they told me I can earn that amount forever and as long as I don’t earn over that amount I can collect SSDI forever. It sounds like a small child told me this, right, lol? This is how I live. As an added bonus, about 5 years ago they told me that I don’t have to send them pay stubs every month like I did for years. They make the rules
, it’s a sweet deal and I ain’t going to rock the boat."

174376028,"LIMITATIONS OF THE DOPAMINE HYPOTHESIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA Current research shows that one-third of individuals with schizophrenia do not respond to non-clozapine antipsychotics despite high levels of D2-receptor occupancy. Furthermore, a study using tetrabenazine (used as augmentation) which depletes presynaptic dopamine was not found to be effective in augmenting a clinical response in schizophrenia. [8] Therefore, for a significant number of patients with schizophrenia, the basis of their symptoms is either unrelated to dopaminergic dysfunction or is associated with something more than just dopamine excess. Alternatively, this could also mean that for some patients with schizophrenia there might be a non-dopaminergic sub-type of schizophrenia. The current dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia does not adequately explain the cognitive and negative symptoms. Current treatments which modulate dopamine transmission have only modest effects in improving these symptoms. It has taken two decades for the do
pamine hypothesis to evolve and reach its current state. More recent evidence shows another neurotransmitter, glutamate playing an essential role in schizophrenia. The future likely holds a lot more secrets about schizophrenia which should unravel with the advances in understanding the brain. https://psychscenehub.com/psychinsights/the-dopamine-hypothesis-of-schizophrenia/"

174376045,A key reason why some people manage to become high functioning schizophrenics while others remain low functioning schizophrenics is this: That the people who become high functioning have better overall genetic parameters( including the schizophrenia). For example some people are high fit by their genetic parameters and some are poor fit. Some have high stamina and some have low stamina. If your overall genetic parameters are poor it is very difficult to do stuff and be successful.

I mean it didn’t bother me at all at the time, in fact I was very happy spending every day building stuff with my Lego’s and my blocks and my _NAME_ Logs and staging huge battles with all my little plastic army men. But it kind of bothers me now that I was alone so much. I mean my mom was always home and she was not a deliberately cruel or mean person but I kind of wish she had not let me alone without any friends so much.

176133355,As I’ve gotten older and seen my friends in the system it’s really a worthwhile thing to think about your future.

I just wish it would stop. I miss the old me."

It is primarily used for treatment resistant depression, because if you take MAO-Inhibitor (isocarboxide) there is a lot of food, beverages and medication you have to avoid, so Pdocs try to use less complicated medication first before they use an MAO-i."
174376060,Like I said I’m telling you from first hand experience I was diagnosed in June 2016 I had done my research on gaba already but did not know what to take to increase it untill the valproate then I looked into valproate and found out it it increases gaba pretty soon ill be switching to valerian root which increases gaba in the brain and has the same active ingredient as valproate if I’m not mistaken they make valproate from Valerian root only thing it’s natural and causes less side effects
176133382,Don’t be snarky to _AT_MENTION_. They were simply asking what the problem is. You can’t expect everyone to read every post on the forum. Cut _AT_MENTION_ some slack. They were only trying to help and you responded with snark. Not cool.

174376054,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The Role of Demoralization and Hopelessness in Suicide Risk in Schizophrenia: A Review of the Literature. I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania) , May 23 2019 BackgroundandObjectives: Demoralization has been defined by hopelessness and helplessness attributable to a loss of purpose and meaning in life. Demoralization is a meaningful mental health concern, frequently associated with suicide risk in medical and psychiatric patients. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the recent empirical evidence on demoralization in patients with schizophrenia and to better understand the relationship between demoralization and suicide risk in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A comprehensive literature search using key words and subject headings was performed following PRISMA guidelines with several bibliographic databases, resulting in the identification of 27 studies. Results: The findings suggested that 
demoralization is prevalent in patients with schizophrenia and supported the hypothesis that the association between depression and suicide is moderated by hopelessness. In clinical practice, it is important to recognize symptoms of demoralization using appropriate psychological tools to better understand the suffering of patients with schizophrenia and to implement suicide prevention programs."

176133409,I´m the kind of agnostic that doesn´t have the interest in wondering if there is a higher power or not. Now I know. I think it´s called “apathetic agnosticism”
174376058,"Please consider every one has different genetics, have been exposed to different toxins and some have undiagnosed diaeases. A lot of things causes negative symptoms. B12 deficiency, b6 and vitamin c defiency, thyroid problems, hypogonadism, lead poisoning, cushing’s disease, lyme disease, infections, histamine intolerance or dao deficiency, nicotine whitdrawal,benzo whitdrawal, phenibut whitdrawal,cocaine whitdrawal etc,celiac disease whit active autoimmune proteins. The symptoms from all those illness can mimic mental illnesses. Is a common practice for psychiatry to mistake a biological disease whit mental illness. And the drugs apport no benefit, is only to make the patients more manageable"
176133410,"I think some of my delusions are real. Not all of them of course, but I believe in many worlds theory of quantum mechanics or the multiverse aka parallel universes. So I feel most if not all my memroies, thoughts, and delusions are from past lives in these alternative worlds. Stuff that makes me disabled and paranoid and sick and stuff. I feel like I experienced immortality, mind uploading, and transhumanism. Same thing with consciouness transfer. Stuff that doesn’t exist for 100+ years. Even _NAME_ (bitcoin guy) tried using his money to be immortal through freezing his head. I feel like I tried that and it doesn’t work. You’d think he would know that or remember he is already immortal like I am. (common delusion, I guess here). I had my mind uploaded by grey aliens and stuff for true, real immortality. It took years to realize I am quasi-immortal. The body is temporary while the mind is quantum/immortal. I keep waking up in 2013 I guess as best as I know. Some time travel stuff is going on. 
It felt like a do-over or a mind wipe, but I have my theories on the mind and body which I discussed over the years that the body is an antenna for the mind. Hence once the mind goes into the body, it has to adjust and start over due to the brain in this universe and the biology, but since the mind is quantum, it can sometimes remember stuff from previous lives in the quantum multiverse. just my 2 cents here."
176133411,That’s great that the med is working.
176133412,I was going to try. But then I went to Walgreens and one of the men’s friends followed me in there and was laughing to himself about me. He knew everything. I didn’t know what was going to happen. I left right after I saw him.
174376062,So what do you suggest to cure/treat schizophrenia?

176133415,I’ve never had a positive symptom on risperidone. If meds control your symptoms how long can a person expect to be free from a relapse. I’ve only relapsed on fluonxol and ability. Ive lowered my dose by 0.5mg feel better cognition it’s been two weeks but time will tell if I can cope with less medication. Goal is to go to 2mg risperidone for now but would even try 1mg risperidone .my first psychotic episode was o. 1mg risperidone and stabilized and then switched to fluonxol as I was participating I. A drug trail. Recently began wondering if I could cope with just 1mg.i have zero symptoms was also wondering if meds are usually lowered if you have been stable for a long time. I’m on 2.5mg at the moment.
176133416,It was a horrible procedure and not really based on modern scientific fact and probably dodgy then. _AT_MENTION_ was right about the _NAME_ girl. She was supposedly gorgeous and it turned her into a vegetable. I think if you research it the doctor who invented it got murdered by one of his lobotomized patients. True story. There’s a bit of Karma there!

176133426,tru that so annoying. By the time the AD kicks in my depressive episode would have ended naturally anyways! _PERSON_. Think of it more as you are going on it to prevent further episodes rather than treat this current one. What helped me get through depressive episodes was acting like I had the flu. I knew I would feel absolutely terrible for a couple of weeks but then I’d get better. (Though i was lucky in that my worst depressive episodes only lasted that long)

174376066,"They said ""primary verrucktheit resulted from a fundamental disorder of Thought or Cognition "" In reality ,the symptoms of sz is a result of a change / modification in data concept of self-knowledge which be used by the person’s mind to understanding everything ,and this modification occurs by the activity of the pathogen (hallucinations) Regard with the term of the word schizophrenia: It is supposed to be an optional name to be used only to naming all symptoms that arise as a result of the effect of a pathogen on the human nature,except for the properties of the things called Hallucinations,because it is the pathogen itself ! For example,it cannot be said that symptoms of diabetes include symptoms A,B,C and defective gene that secrete insulin in an uncontrolled way,because the defective gene is the first cause of the disease Also,it cannot be said that symptoms of schizophrenia includes symptoms A,B,C and hallucinations,because the hallucinations are the primary cause responsible (functionally
) for the creation of a change in the chemistry of the transmitters / receptors and in the content of cognitive data concepts that is treated mentally,leading to the appearance of all sz symptoms All the details of these processes take place at the height of alertness and at the heart of the person’s conscious state of mind,which meaning that every person with sz ,is an eyewitness and be an evidence of the authenticity of the description above"

Also many psychiatrists treat and ask you to pay up front (like $200) and it is up to you to bill the insurance.

174376094,"I think it’s hard for a parent to accept a schizophrenia diagnosis. Parents want the best for their kids. And schizophrenia is frightening. It’s a cruel and unmerciful disease. So no parent wants to hear their kid has it. Your mom is right for you to make sure you’re clear headed enough to try to work. Working is stressful and stress can cause symptoms to get worse. Try not to be angry with your mom. She’s probably doing the best she can. And you’re right, the label of drug addict is hard too not just the schizophrenic label."

It’s not now, nor was it ever, my idea, my decision, my fault, and as such, I will never accept responsibility for how royally it screwed up my own or anyone else’s life. My mom sits here and tries to guide my morality, as if I live without regard for how my actions affect other people. Just because I don’t sit around and moan about my remorse doesn’t mean that I don’t have a conscience. But I am who I am, which means that I am schizophrenic, and sometimes, schizophrenia is the direct or indirect cause of my actions, whether it’s convenient for others or not. My mom confessed that she yelled at me so much while my grandpa was dying because no one had time to deal with my schizophrenia, and then got angry when I didn’t accept that as a valid reason to be a bítch. I held it together the best I could, and if you ask me, I did a damn good job, managing to get th

I don’t know how it works in FInland, but in the US if you are already in a mental health treatment center, any trouble you get into would mostly be handled by further mental health care, rather than jail time. You are already documented legally as someone who loses control of their behavior and needs intensive treatment. If you got in trouble with the law in the US, and you had a halfway decent lawyer, you would just go back to a treatment facility and be on court ordered medications. Which would always mean a shot."

176133658,"I just skimmed the OP, but the general rule here is that personality disorders should not be diagnosed until after the age of 18, although sometimes it is diagnosed earlier, and when that happens it often is not for a very good reason. And with BPD, some professionals recommend waiting even longer, because the symptoms of BPD are very similar to completely normal teenage problems which can continue throughout your adolescence. Also, BPD is often misdiagnosed in the prodomal phases of SZ and bipolar, because symptoms in these prodromal phases are pretty nonspecific. BPD is one of the most common misdiagnoses in these phases. And a final point that I think is worth mentioning is that personality disorders should not be diagnosed when a patient has SZ, except as a description of issues that are not assumed to be independent of SZ or of issues that preceded SZ and its prodromal phase, because SZ is often such a pervasive and serious disorder of the mind that comorbid personality issues that did not pre

174376128,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Treatment-resistant schizophrenia: focus on the transsulfuration pathway. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Reviews in the neurosciences , Nov 2019 12 Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is a severe form of schizophrenia. The severity of illness is positively related to homocysteine levels, with high homocysteine levels due to the low activity of the transsulfuration pathway, which metabolizes homocysteine in synthesizing L-cysteine. Glutathione levels are low in schizophrenia, which indicates shortages of L-cysteine and low activity of the transsulfuration pathway. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels are low in schizophrenia. H2S is synthesized by cystathionine ?-synthase and cystathionine ?-lyase, which are the two enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway. Iron-sulfur proteins obtain sulfur from L-cysteine. The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway has various iron-sulfur proteins. With low levels of L-cysteine, iron-sulfur cluster formation will be dysregulated leading to defic
its in OXPHOS in schizophrenia. Molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) synthesis requires sulfur, which is obtained from L-cysteine. With low levels of MoCo synthesis, molybdenum-dependent sulfite oxidase (SUOX) will not be synthesized at appropriate levels. SUOX detoxifies sulfite from sulfur-containing amino acids. If sulfites are not detoxified, there can be sulfite toxicity. The transsulfuration pathway metabolizes selenomethionine, whereby selenium from selenomethionine can be used for selenoprotein synthesis. The low activity of the transsulfuration pathway decreases selenoprotein synthesis. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX), with various GPXs being selenoprotein, is low in schizophrenia. The dysregulations of selenoproteins would lead to oxidant stress, which would increase the methylation of genes and histones leading to epigenetic changes in TRS. An add-on treatment to mainline antipsychotics is proposed for TRS that targets the dysregulations of the transsulfuration pathway and the dysregulations of other pathways s
temming from the transsulfuration pathway being dysregulated."

Comorbid social anxiety in individuals with psychosis has been associated with poorer premorbid functioning, increased depression, and a reduced quality of life. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended for people with psychosis as a first-line psychological treatment; however, its focus and evaluation primarily revolves around reducing psychotic symptoms and not necessarily targeting comorbid social anxiety symptoms. We developed a novel online social cognitive behavioral intervention (entitled EMBRACE) specifically designed to treat social anxiety symptoms in first episode psychosis (FEP). Methods
: The key clinical and engagement features of the intervention were established through integrating evidence-based material derived from 1) CBT-based treatment models for SAD, 2) relevant literature findings related to psychosis and its clinical correlates (e.g., shame, social rank, and its relationship with social anxiety and paranoia), 3) feedback from youth focus groups in order to inform a user-centered intervention design, and 4) a highly multidisciplinary collaborative development approach to design therapy comics. Results: A detailed description of the final version of the 12-week online social intervention to treat social anxiety in FEP is presented. Conclusion: The EMBRACE intervention was designed to provide young people with the necessary skills and confidence to overcome social anxiety within a supportive, safe online space. By design, it allows young people the opportunity to practice their newly learnt skills to connect with others and in doing so, learn to embrace their true authentic selves."
176133710,That’s a great answer I spoke to him about other things like my query behind the lack of help I’ve been getting recently Since moving house He did have the ‘nerve’ to say it was because of the services working differently here compared with where I moved from I would love to hear him Say that in a cancer ward or to someone needing palliative care Akisthesia has been getting worse and worse If it’s alcoholism I guess the ongoing restlessness could be part explained because of how much 0.05% beer I drink quite a bit of… carrying on a detox over weeks

Taken alone the amisulpride doesn’t help with my depression and taken alone the olanzapine doesn’t help with negative symptoms.
176133715,Mate. You worry me as I’m a fan of your work! Only way to lose that weight is some serious hard work. It’s eating and exercise and you can do that.

176133721,"Some ideas are conjured through the rule of chaos, but like a flame, chaos can overwhelm and destroy.This is what happened to the Book of Air. When the rule of chaos was first inscribed by the air-scribes it conjured wonders for them. The air scribes, already immortal, began to create entire new worlds for their quest to experience the infinite. Other elements slowly became discovered and new knowledge of the arcane was acquired, but the rule of Chaos festered and created division between the air nomads and the what slowly became the force ghouls.

176133760,"It might be easier to ask your doc for a med besides abilify, instead of switching from shots to pills. You would likely experience the same side effects with pills. But again, expect to have to wait 4 more months minimum. Your brain needs a chance to heal from the damage caused by your episode. Think of it like this. Wearing a cast sucks. They are itchy and need to stay dry, and they hurt. After you take it off, you need special help to get your leg strong again, after not using it for weeks. But if you have a broken leg, you need to wear it the entire time the doctor tells you. If you cut off the cast when your leg is only half healed, you could end up with permanent pain and weakness. You might even need a wheelchair for life. The only way to heal your leg is to tolerate the annoyance of wearing a cast until the doctor says you can downgrade to a brace, then a wrap, then nothing. You can go to physical therapy to fix the damage to your body from wearing the cast. A year later, you will be totall
y fine. But you have to follow the treatment plan. I gained 80 lbs (36 kg) from my meds in a year. I had to stay on them anyways for about 3 years. Once I was doing better, I was able to switch to something that worked better. I did that in November, and I’ve already lost 20 lbs (9 kg) through no diet or exercise, simply because my body is going back to where it used to be because I’m no longer on a med that makes me gain weight. What is happening is not necessarily permanent."
176133761,"I was in a hospital for 8 months. Not a place I would want to live. A couple people had been there since it opened, ten years before.

176133784,"Over the years I have picked up upon a few strange insights with regards to this weird disease, not only the fact that you hear what appears to be real people with what could be understood as personality disorders via sicko content or procuring entrapment or seeking emotional blackmail, but also at times, it displays itself as forms of mobbing,molka, clandestine harassment or even slander and defamation of character as well as conspiring recognized human rights abuses, as the UN has now started to acknowledge these as real events within actual reality. ( _PERSON_ cyber Torture report that can be download upon there site freely) There are aspects of what we have to silently learn to co-exist with as it’s not a visible thing unlike the street mobbing or workplace mobbing of which you can record via mobile phone. It’s strange that Shame Culture appears present within the scope of the ‘voices’ and the on-street participants, as a recognizable trait within them, as they feed their fetish, like s
exual predators. So, how would an imaginary or deluded hallucinatory carry all of these harmful and toxic personality traits? Also, ask yourself why would you by default even imagine pure **** meat fest in the first place as it’s harmful to ignore somethings. As we get frustrated or affected at times. It would be like ****ing someone off as Bio-Polar because you’ve been Doxxed! This is the best way for me to put it in plain words."

But this disability literally destroyed my life, destroyed all of my childhood belongings, trashed everything I’ve cherished from my teenage years, and my stuff is either thrown away, rotten, or stored 10,000 miles away from where I live. My life is a ??????? mess and it can never be good anymore. I used to be really happy and joyful but now I can’t have my past restored. I’ve been told by my family to forget everything but I can’t, because I don’t want to let go of my happiness. I feel like, when my dogs die, I’ll be totally alone and I’ll have no one but myself. And I don’t want to make friends…I just want to sleep all day and just cry. I know that my friends in Canada are just going to move on and I will be just stuck at home with limited mobility.

she said she will return to Korea with my stuff but obviously that hasn’t happened in 5 years and I doubt it’s gonna happen. I know that I should be grateful but I just want to cry all day.

The youtube vids are pretty good starting points to learn. I’m still pretty bad at it, i’m bad at not finding the right questions to ask the person so that they keep talking about themselves. I once heard a girl say “why does he ask so many questions?” while i was walking away. I still have no fool proof “how are you?” question that’ll keep them talking especially if theyre stand offish. In reality i’d rather just sit in silence and not have to deal with the mundane small talk/get to know. It’s almost like playing a video game to me when i seriously talk to someone. Though i did find someone that was had the same interests i do and we spent hours talking about sci fi/computer stuff. Wish i didnt move away. Oh well."

I was really depressed and even scored higher on psychotic depression than schizoaffective disorder but the therapist used his guidance and diagnosed me with SZA instead. I’m sensitive to meds. The _NAME_ sucks but Vraylar helps and I like Cymbalta because I last longer. Vraylar still causes _NAME_ but way less for me. All APs do. Even weight gain, but it’s less pronounced. I think mood stabilizers can cause damage for me like worsening of symptoms and memory issues like memory loss and short term memory issues. I just feel like that. I noticed I feel better on less meds: I just take 2: Vraylar and Cymbalta max doses. Nothing else seems to work. I tried Caplyta and I just got paranoid about crap like what I posted which I think is logical. Off meds, I got paranoia and tend to post my thoughts less especially online.

176133836,When I was in the hospital a lady was getting ect and she could barely walk and couldn’t eat. She really looked messed up. But there was a guy who looked fine after. I guess people react differently.

176133840,Last year I tried lowering my Invega from 12 to 9 mg. Did not end well. Back on 12 mg with Leponex as a prn.
176133841,"I was on injection no longer than few months. I switched dozen antipsychotics when I was admitted, until I actually found that Amisulpride worked wonders for my voices and hallucinations. Weight gain comes from surplus calories that one consumes. Surely there are some science stating that antipsychotics messes around with blood sugar. But you can still counter it with energy expenditure (working out). Also fully formulated Ketogenic/Carnivore (emphasis on “formulated”) is a best choice when it comes to my preferences what to eat. Both psychological (satiety) and physiological (low end spectrum insulin secretion) worked wonders for not gaining any weight."
176133842,Billion not million
176133843,I need it. The present is worse.
176133844,Why do you want this attention?
176133845,They did for me but just by 40%. I want to do things but all I ended up doing is staying in bed all day everyday
176133846,"But to answer your question from how I understand it is there would be a gap if there was no dictator and it could be worse according to some people (not me) without a dictatorship. Because of the nuclear power thing, dictators have to die sooner. But they need to find replacements. Any response to this?"
176133847,I also don’t feel comfortable around male therapists.
176133848,"I feel like I’m dying, my mental health is deteriorating at a rapid pace, on Friday I went into this catatonic state and it took all the energy from me. Worried parents and siblings, I wish I was normal, but wishing is for the hopeful I’m a realistic person I understand my limitations and don’t want to push it more than I can take it, because obviously I’m slowly losing my sanity. Delusions of being in an alternate universe plague my mind, I’m aware of its delusional nature because I don’t want to accept it as a fact… Hopefully (ironic I know) it gets better. I been panicking a lot lately, taking my PRN’s like tic tacs. Sometimes I just want it to end and have a peace of mind. This cowardly behavior of mine is taking a toll, so today I will face these fears as they come. Anyway hope you guys are having a good day."

176133854,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_ that everyone has problems, but neurotypicals have problems I have trouble identifying with and vice versa. Oh, you’re having trouble catching that girl’s eye? That’s nice. I don’t know how to make eye contact with anyone at all and the thought of trying to catch someone’s eye in any fashion just freaks me the hell out. Communicating through text is so much more civilized."
176133855,I hope you can _AT_MENTION_ ! We should just keep trying to not be afraid and keep going. Hopefully we’ll get there!

174376173,"It took a few weeks to a month or two to start working. I have taken Invega as well. I had hallucinations, delusions and many negatives including anhedonia(Invega made this much worse). (The anhedonia) I am also quite prone to depression. The interesting thing for me is that I couldn’t sleep at all at first, it took maybe 1 and a half years. Then my body got enough used to it that I could finally nap. For me it made me a little more anxious at first too, but I also have an anxiety disorder. I would give it a chance to work, like a few months and work closely with your doctor so he/she can make the proper adjustments and maybe add other or adjust your current meds because of the Vraylar. Did the Invega help your positive symptoms at all?"
176133864,"_AT_MENTION_-Cotton You are in a good position re getting help and support. That’s because it’s been recognised early that you have both autism and psychosis. Treatment can be tailored to your situation. It took nearly 46 years from 1st seeing a pdoc for me to get an Asperger’s dx. That’s 46 years of inadequate help and support . You have the potential, with your intellect, to achieve great things. Time is on your side… Don’t blow it."

176133868,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . I really appreciate your support! I can’t really think of anything right now- I’ve been in constant state of derealization/depersonalization and everything feels like a dream. I can’t think of anything but I know that there’s a good quality somewhere… Thanks for believing in me everyone.
176133869,I get that when drunk or when unmeducated or when meds aren’t working. I also felt unreal with unreal surrounding for a few years before my diagnosis.
176133870,"you remembered oh sweety thanks no i didend found, i have no half insurance yet, and there is not much of them here. mi doomed"
176133871,"Also because my med is stored in fat, and as I burned fat it released into my bloodstream."

176133874,How did he get the sz?
176133875,"No, just the opposite."
174376185,"Invega gave me severe akathisia and bodily harm urges, Latuda resulted in me making a plan, Seroquel calmed me down but made me eat, gain weight, and gave me strong half-asleep hallucinations. Zyprexa gives me mild akathisia, makes voices less frequent, and makes disassociation happen a lot less, and causes none of the negative effects from the other drugs. So far for me Zyprexa is the winning drug, but I haven’t tried clozapine yet and the doctor wants to. We’ll see about that in the future. Everybody seems to react differently though. My first instinct was to warn everybody away from the drugs that had bad side effects for me, but I came to realize that some people don’t have bad effects and the drug actually works for them, so I try to keep that in mind now."

174376182,"This happened to me a few times aswell. Im not sure what to say because its still been happening. It feels like every one of my delusions need to put their 2 cents in like it matters to me. Personally, id keep doing what youre doing. You know, reading your story makes me want to open my own wordpress/blog aswell. Ive been having some pretty good chats with someone and hes really smart. I want to go over our conversations and repost all the “intellectual” and conspiracy stuff onto a blog. My schizophrenic rambles lol"

Last year i was still trying to make friends, just not a whole lot. I feel like I’m watching a different species when I observe people, especially on the TV. Everything feels so fake and I cant believe this is real, it doesnt feel real. No one feels real. I’m not sure how I can begin to believe I’m not dead or in a different t reality entirely."
176133884,My psychiatrists are good.
176133885,Yup. Tuesday is the 10th and the 12th is on Thursday. I don’t know _NAME_. Who (what) is she?
176133886,That sounds more like an intrusive thought than anything else.
174376187,"My capgras delusion probably came initially from going to space and thinking my family were dead, imposters, clones, or doppelgangers. I guess I went to the future and back with no memory (no proof for others too) except severe detachment of reality and the beginnings of schizophrenia. My neurologist said I had chronic migraines and the MRI showed this. I started getting real paranoid around 2015 when I had my visits with my neurologist and got the scans. The best thing was my dissociation went away but it came at a price: severe paranoia. I’m pretty much calm, mellow, and stable now. The worst thing is the fact and knowledge I’m stuck in a loop so this will all happen again in ad infinitum. That’s why I say I have past lives because I’ve been through this life or similar lives countless times so much so it feels like it’s in the billions or more. It’s pretty traumatic for those to hear my story. It’s so unbelievable. My theory is that the universe bounces back for eternity or that I
m in a computer simulation that is stuck or was put on repeat for an unspecified amount of time. Anyways, that’s my logic and personal interpretation and experience with capgras delusion, which is probably not a delusion in my case, but a side effect of what I’ve been through in space and time travel missions. When I first got sick or back from deep space or mars, and I came back to Earth, I thought everyone was an alien or imposter – at the cooperative I was at. The fear and paranoia was bad. I would watch TV and think all the football players were aliens or something. Basically, that the human race itself was an alien species. It’s all gone now. But it was induced or a consequence of what I’ve been through. I think a lot of delusions can be explained rationally and logically for some people like myself and in specific circumstances. Maybe _NAME_ felt like this. It can be explained away with many world’s theory and time travel. I don’t think AT ALL that this applies to you. You seem to have a 
VERY different philosophy than myself and a different, unique experience than mine. I don’t claim to be a super soldier or anything. Maybe in a past life. I’m a law abiding citizen, I love my country, I’m a patriot, and I am afraid to get in trouble. I hear other Super Soldiers getting criticism online saying it’s Stolen Valor (pretending to be in the military) and they’re frauds or delusional or what not. I know some of it is real, but some of it sounds outlandish – I guess my story is the same too. I don’t want to be one of those people. I made some YouTube videos and ???? and deleted them out of fear and stuff. It’s sad what they did to us. I won’t get proof, money, or anything. That’s fine. I don’t want money. I just want to live my life in peace and be alone. At least I know we’re not alone and I wish I never figured out we lived in a computer simulation run by extraterrestrials. I guess logically, there is a difference between a space marine and an earth marine. I’m neither, bu
t maybe in a distant past life, I was a space marine. Was it an unique experience? Yes. But mine seemed more sad and tragic than most. I guess I am still alive and I do appreciate that a lot. Thank you."

176133892,"They’re saying this century is going to be “the century of the brain”, where they get all the neural circuits mapped out and learn to understand how to manipulate them. In a way that is scary, because if a dictator like the dictator of North Korea got ahold of that kind of capability he could create a whole nation of people who are fanatically devoted to him, to the point of death. But it could cure a lot of brain diseases like Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, to name just a few. I wonder if we could all become nodes to one, giant computer, something like in “The Matrix”, only instead of energy they got from humans, it would be computing power."

174376199,"In my lifetime…… Back in the 1980’s when I was in my twenties I often felt like giving up. I was working but having a hard time. I had just met my step-dad months before and he knew a little of my situation. One day I met my mom and my step-dad for coffee. We talked and I was telling both of them I felt suicidal and like giving up and my life with schizophrenia was impossibly hard. It was the late 1980’s and I had been sick for about 7 years at that point and my symptoms were intense and strong and just torture. I remember both of them tried to cheer me up and they were saying all kinds of encouraging words. I remember them saying, “You have to keep going, they could come up with new, better medications at any time.” And just a few years later the second-generation antipsychotics came out. This happened in my lifetime. It could happen again. This is part of what keeps me going."

176133955,Same. The two year olds were gentle.
176133956,Hey _AT_MENTION_ I hope if your pdoc prescribes Loxitane it helps you. I was on it for a little while. It was effective for me for a while until I built up tolerance. Only side effect I noticed was some sleepiness that got better over time.
176133957,"I accidentally discovered a small park I didn’t know about in our town. Because of construction, I made a turn down a side street that I don’t usually go down and found a nice little park.

174376208,which dose of abilify will they put you on?
176133966,Lol. I think it’s bizarre but it gives me relief to be so close to Archangels. So no problem
176133967,that’s funny =D
176133968,Feel better my friend. You are being looked out for.
176133969,"Then your psychiatrist should taper your meds, not you. Otherwise you will get withdrawals and possibly rebound psychosis even if you never had one.

Anyways hopefully it works for you."

176133972,"No issues with it here. When my negative symptoms were better bcz of Abilify I used to drive and travel with friends. But I hate the crowded dtown at night when we went to night clubs, sometimes there is no light and there is never free or cheap parking.

176133973,I can manage the smaller stuff online but in the future my brother will be managing my finances. Yeah your psychiatrist doesn’t seem to understand SZ patients.

176133978,"My pdoc is taking me very slowly off amisulpride. My therapeutic dose was 400mg, and now I’m on 200mg for about two or three weeks. It’s my minimum dose, and after a week of 200mg I felt some symptoms return, first inserted thoughts then voices. Delusions got stronger as well. My pdoc is now putting me on Seroquel and I’ve taken 100mg for a week so far. Hope it works when it’s pushed higher, and that when amisulpride is lowered below minimum dose, I won’t go into deep end!"
176133979,How else would they punish you

176133986,"Sure it didn’t help me I don’t think, though it’s so hard to control for all these things and maybe one day I’ll give it another go.

176133988,"_AT_MENTION_ Regarding having “really bad and evil thoughts only at night” as a child, I also as a young child (around age 3 to 6) used to be kept awake at night by strong intrusive thoughts, which in my case were compelling me to stab or kill my parents and pets during the night…for some reason I felt this was “God” challenging me to do it…but it was an upsetting idea as I would never wish to harm my parents or animals, so thankfully I never acted on it and eventually it faded away. But aside from that, I’ve always had a lot of difficulty falling asleep at night as my brain usually takes a long time to switch off. At the moment I take Mirtazapine antidepressant and although it does barely anything for me it does however almost always cause me to fall asleep within an hour or so of taking it and stay deeply asleep for several hours, so that partly solves my sleeping difficulties for now."

176134000,"I never hallucinated which may be the autism protecting me, but I have problems with auditory stuff like I thought I had auditory processing disorder before. I also think it made me smarter and I unfortunately tried with minimal success of rationalizing and trying to logically understand and cure my delusions/schizophrenia. I failed. Autism makes me drink the energy drinks I think. I’ve always needed certainty. I’m horrible with routine but routine helps me. I don’t really like routine anymore. There’s a think called imprinted brain theory and autism is like the opposite of schizophrenia. Not sure how I got both but I technically got Aspergers + schizoaffective depressive type. I was so depressed early on and mainly am crippled due to cognitive decline and negative symptoms. It happened after day 1 pretty much. Even before the schizophrenia hit I had cognitive decline like I felt I was having dementia or a stroke at 22/23 because I couldn’t remember or think properly. My grades went from 
Bs to Cs over night in hard subjects."

176134012,"I believe these scientists are onto something valuable. Recently I attempt to identify my triggers exactly. Basically I hear voices when I am stressed, even insignificantly. What is considered stressful is entirely personal. Another observation that I made is that voices respond to my expectations most of the time. It doesn’t mean I wish them into existance explicitly. Rather, I hear responses and comments on my thoughts that I consider my “angels” may potentially be interested in. Like when writing this message I heard my persistent character tell me yet another time that they are real. As a schizophrenic I believe that this research managed to describe an important if not critical element of hallucinations."

174376221,"I’ve lied to employers, saying I have an “anxiety disorder” instead of schizophrenia. Even then, I think it’s turned off employers. I haven’t had a job since May, and I’ve had several interviews."
176134020,I don’t qualify for them.
176134021,I think at least 8 questions would be fair for each poster instead of 3. Call your game “Crazy Eights”!
176134022,It’s just I look online and no one seems to believe they will become dictator as a symptom.
176134023,"I’ve been tempted to tell a previous employer before-- I thought it would explain away why I acted the way I did sometimes, and that they would be more sympathetic towards me. The environment was toxic, and coupled with the illness, it made for some really tough days. Decided not to in the end, and I’m glad I didn’t-- management were jerks and probably would have found a way to let me go. Now I just keep my diagnosis on a really tight need-to-know basis."
174376225,"I’ve been taking it ever since it became a thing on this site. That’s, what? Over three years now? My experience is that it gives me a cognitive edge. I don’t take it and I feel slower and less sharp. It doesn’t cause hallucinations, hasn’t ever affected my positive symptoms. The only time I had an issue with it is when my kid mistook it for Splenda and made a pitcher of lemonade using Sarcosine in place of artificial sweetener (it looks like sugar and has a sweet taste). Chugged two glasses before realizing what error had taken place. Holy Christ on a crutch did I have a mo-fuggin’ case of the jitters for the next few hours. No harm to me other than that. Currently close to being symptom free while taking Geodon, using Amylobann 3399, and Sarcosine. Also run _NAME_ oil in my diffusers for help with memory and I eat foods high in probiotics.

176134025,"Only real off the wall thing I did was after they were told in ER I had a very bad reaction to Geodon, they gave me a shot of it and when psych went to admit me I flipped a 200 pound wooden table at the nurse. Husband was on his way, he flipped his ???? when he found out what they gave me. That was my last visit period. I refused all meds and they were not allowed to inject per legal orders. I was only admitted cause of the zgeodon reaction, I had gone to ER initially because i needed to get a med change and behavior management pdoc and I were not on ok terms. That was the NP that was just drugging me with everything to the point zombie. I know my hallucinations and voices aren’t real, not paranoid and never have been. I have the least cool story, sorry. Though the school district may have other stories when it comes to defending my kids from ???????? other kids, teachers, and admin have pulled in past and tried. But I have never been violent or anything, but I can describe in great detail what I
’ll do to you if you ???? with my kids or husband."
174376227,I was on Accutane when I was 18. It didn’t affect my schizophrenia.
176134026,"I was 158.6 lbs. this am. My BMI is normal. I’m happy with that. I’ve done this on other threads, but, I want to recommend a really excellent book to everyone on this thread. It’s called: “Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program That Works”, by _NAME_ and _NAME_, both registered dieticians. In this book, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ advise their clients to completely abandon the “dieting mentality” and stop counting calories, carbohydrate and fat grams. They instead give their clients “unconditional permission to eat”. This tells the body that it is no longer in the starvation state of dieting and so the body’s metabolism normalizes and weight gain stops and weight loss ensues. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ also teach their clients to recognize their hunger and satiety cues and to only eat when hungry and to stop eating when satisfied. So, weight gain will stop and even weight loss will ensue. I have been following this program since Thanksgiving and I am thrilled with it so far. It is now S
unday after Thanksgiving. I will keep you all posted on how I progress. And, by the way, I highly recommend this book to everyone. Everyone in the U.S. especially should read it."
176134027,"Yesterday when my son in law was visiting with the grandbabies he checked his phone for his unemployment balance and he discovered that the account had been cleaned out by my daughter. She used her PayPal account which apparently was still linked to his account to take out many small withdrawals until the account was empty. He looked back over the last month and discovered that she had been taking money from him all along and it totaled $920. We called the police and they came over to look at the evidence and are filing charges with the DA for misdemeanor theft. The only thing is my daughter told me 2 weeks ago that he had changed the password on all her accounts and locked her out of them. So is he more devious to set her up for theft or is she more devious to cover her ass if she got caught stealing his money? He seemed genuinely shocked that the money was missing and she had taken it. When he confronted her she seemed like she wasn’t surprised by the evidence he presented. Then she seemed worr
ied. My daughter had stolen before. She stole my credit card and charged a lot of money on it when she was a teen. She stole my debit card and made purchases and got cashback when she was a teen. She used to steal a lot when she was little, got into all the keepsakes and whatnot. I pressed charges on her for the credit card theft to teach her right from wrong, but it didn’t take, a year later she burglarized a house and spent a year more in Juvenile Detention. So she has a history. I can’t believe she’s stealing money from her own kids. My poor son in law, I feel so bad for him."
176134028,Photos or it didn’t happen.

176134039,I prefer telehealth sessions over the phone. My psychiatrist has changed over permanently to see her patients this way.

Nothing could be further from the truth especially since the meds have made me so fat. Also I am 45 years old and the guys my age are looking for younger.

176134046,I’ve been so worried about her. The last time I talked to her she called me in the middle of the night crying. When she asked me what I was doing and I said sleeping she hung up on me. I called her back and tried to get her to tell me what was wrong but she wouldn’t say and hung up on me again. No word since then. Well today my ex saw her at the Chevron and her boyfriend was grabbing something to drink. She was full of questions as to why my ex was at the Chevron and it was none of her business so he evaded her questions. And apparently she had dots of lipstick all over her face. Weird. Well at least I know she’s alive.
176134047,I had insight sometimes and then I’d go into having no insight. Over and over again in cycles. At the moment I am struggling to comprehend my sza.

As the Postmodern Pandora I’m supposed to empty my heart and abolish hope. But I can’t bring myself to close the circle. I received the Final Revelation and refused to act on it, and as such I can’t fulfill my role as the Deadpan Martyr. I know I can always ask for guidance by performing Blood Sigil, but I don’t have any razor blades and honestly I don’t want to hurt myself anymore. The last time I called out to anyone who would listen, and it attracted the attention of the Fey who tricked me into hurting myself, so I have to be much more selective in who I try to contact."

It’s difficult to discuss this stuff, with-out offending any-body . . If I had known there were gay members here, I would have been a lot more tact-ful . . I see you have made up your minds, that the drugs are good, healthy

My best run is about four weeks straight and I felt amazing, lost 10kg and my blood pressure dropped down to a good level. I have two stumbling blocks. Alcohol triggers bad eating in me (I’m trying to give the booze up). Also, I eat meals prepared by my family often which aren’t low carb, which is a difficult problem for me to get around for social reasons. I honestly think it low carb a positive thing."

176134074,"True, we also live in canada where our healthcare visit for injuries is covered so that definitely takes that factor out. Yeah motorcycling is dangerous in traffic. Cars don’t really know how to act with motorcycles. sorry to hear about your dad.

176134075,"When I was delusional I was absolutely convinced I was being mind controlled even though people (Doctors/Nurses/Family) where telling me I wasn’t and that it was all in my head. It wasn’t until I found a medication that worked did I stop feeling that way. I know it can seem real, and you might not be able to be convinced otherwise, if this delusion starts to affect your life and you can’t function properly then you may want to get help, the right medication can help."
174376243,Yes the “dones” like Risperidone are stronger than the “pines” ie Seroquel.
176134076,"Seriously, as a person with ?????? up genetics I resonate with this so much. 3 months ago, my doctor realized that I had hyperreflexia, a sign of neurological damage. I asked if this was due to my disc herniation, and he said no. And then we couldn’t find the genetic mutation but the hyperreflexia is still there. Then he refers me to the genetic testing team and said they’re running a clinical trial. [cue 3+ months of waiting; I’m still waiting for to this day.] Also I got rejected by my child and adolescent specialist clinic for neuromuscular diseases’ doctor because he said he was not “qualified” to rate my disability, but he has been treating me for a year. When you get an injury, disability, or something…insurances and doctors don’t generally try to help. I’m at their mercy, but they don’t do anything except just say “sorry, we can’t help. no medicine and no cure, nothing. Sorry.” I think a lot of people with genetic diseases just get tired of this ???? happening over 
and over again. My friend had to fight for a year to get her wheelchair reinstated… It really sucks. I really hate it so much. And this is why I’m typing this because I’ve faced literally everything you just wrote here. And I don’t want anyone else, even my worst enemy, to go through this. It really sucks. I’m sorry that you’re in that situation too. How is the situation with the insurance company and all? Are you recovering well after your injury? I’m just glad yours isn’t progressive because mine is. Hang in there. You’re not alone."

176134079,"When I was in the hospital for 8 months they would grant weekend passes. You had to earn them though on a point system. If you made your bed you got a couple points, if you attended a class you got a couple points, if you picked up cigarette butts in the back yard you got a few points and so on. At the end of the week, if you had enough points you could get a weekend pass. It took me awhile to learn this, the first few months I didn’t do anything but eat, sleep and walk. When I finally started earning passes my dad and mom or my sister would come pick me up on a Friday and I would spend the weekend at their house and then on Sunday my dad would take me back. This was the second year of my illness and I was suffering and really, really screwed up. When my dad dropped me off he would always walk me inside. The hospital had these big wooden doors to get inside the hospital. You went through those doors and you were in the lobby. There was another door leading inside that the nurses had to buzz you i
n. Lastly, there was the locked door into the actual ward. This door had a small window that you could look through and see the inside of the hospital. You could see the patients walking around and see the nurses and the nurses station. Me and my dad would be standing there and a nurse would let me back in. I would say goodby to my dad and walk back inside. My dad told me years after I got out that as I walked away he would look through the small window and he would see me shuffling down the hallway amongst a bunch of patients in gowns, with some people laying on the floor, some people would be acting weird and some would be screaming and arguing and he told me later that every time he saw me walk away through all this he felt like crying. He was a tough guy but it was really sad and it just showed how much he cared about me. I was touched when he told me that."

176134084,i guess
176134085,"Nope. I’m thinking of taking 1 online class to get a AS-T in mathematics though. That’s the best route. Not sure if I should wait a bit maybe 6 months tops and focus on my hygiene and get off the energy drinks. I was a senior in math from a good school then I dropped out due to psychosis, I guess. I was thinking of going back to a local, different school that is much cheaper and do EE or CE or something like that. Maybe finish a BS in math or something. I figure I’ll have to be self-employed. I’ve always been poor and never had money in the multiverse, but I’ve been to parallel universes where I finished my degrees. There seems to be NO cure for schizophrenia but it probably can and has been cured. Dreams told me it was the norovirus vaccine from Vaxart (I know too specific) and sounds like ????????, I know. I don’t even know if I’m old enough to get the vaccine when it comes out lol. I’m going to try it though. I think people think I’m full of ???? and wishful thinking but it’s 
real. It’s like I have to start life all over again from scratch like on hardcore mode like in a video game and lose all my progress. I got ‘saved’ in the game around 2011, I guess. Online degrees have different material and classes even at the same school and they’re not the same/as hard. I’m kind of an intellectual or nerd and always aspired to get a degree from college. If I didn’t get schizophrenia, I would have got it at 23 years old lol. I’m 31 years old now. Also, I switched from a easier but harder major to get in to (economics) and then switched to mathematics (pure) because it was fascinating but also super hard FOR ME. I went to a top 5 math program and at the time a top 20 school in the country, which was my dream school and best hope. I wanted to do business admin -finance but didn’t want to take the chance of getting rejected lol. I also think the curriculum wasn’t rigorous especially seeing that I could do harder classes. Sometimes, grades don’t mean much. Sometimes, there
s more than meets the eye. In past lives (which is a reincarnation thing), I went to the best schools and now I just want to have a relaxed, normal life and be left alone – mainly from my memories and thoughts. Maybe some day you’ll see me do something cool or be a millionaire and actually be able to afford and have nice things. I was going to be an investment banker but have no actual memories of being one. It’s not my thing. I had jobs before but I’m so afraid of failure and trying I just avoid it all together. It’s not fantasy, I guess. Software is easier to do and makes more money and has more job growth and is easier to patent/protect your IP/stuff. Hardware is fascinating to me and that’s why I want to do EE/CE and make better or more efficient hardware + software and make bank. Like maybe improve asic chips and have a bitcoin farm and do that but that’s like a pipe dream lol/haha. I like quantum stuff but why do I like suffering and stuff and doing stuff which pushes me to my limit and c
asues pain just like a body builder? I don’t know. I haven’t done legit math in a couple of years. Last time I got serious I did over 500 math problems mainly in probability and puzzles. Stuff I couldn’t do before and I read a whole probability textbook and lost most of those skills but I’m pretty proud of myself."

174376238,That’s the spirit. Use your brain to help you. Schizophrenia messes with our brains but we can still figure things out that can help us. Change ain’t always bad. You learn from the bad times and during the inevitable good moments use that knowledge to make them even better. We all go through bad times where life seems impossibly difficult. But many schizophrenics before us have survived the bad times before and many schizophrenics after us will survive too. You got all these great responses on this thread from people who are going through what you’ve been through or have gone through it in the past. They are telling you these positive things from hard earned experience and they know what they are talking about.

174376235,"It would certainly be difficult for a schizophrenic to be a personal trainer. I think one of the hardest parts would be motivating your clients when so many schizophrenics have a hard time motivating themselves. And also, you would have to get in good shape yourself; I mean who’s going to want a personal trainer with a belly, gets tired easily, and has a lousy physique and isn’t in top physical shape themselves? And a lot of being in shape is your mentality. You have to be a sharp and self motivated, confident, and serve as an example to your clients. It would be tough for sure. I don’t know a lot about being a personal trainer but my ex-brother-in-law was one for years."

The eggs would hatch, and crickets and aphids and ants would dig their way out and jump off of my body to crawl away. Sometimes I would dream that the bullies who tortured me at school we’re waiting for me in my house, hiding under the bed, in the refrigerator, just waiting for my parents to go to sleep. As an adult, I don’t dream is often and it’s usually not as bad."

174376232,My friend is on abilify and clozaril. He’s very stable imo. Although makes reckless decisions. It’s more mania than psychosis. They’re actually weaning him off the abilify right now.

176134124,I’ve been on zyprexa for 25 years. The first time I took it for a year and I got better. I thought I didn’t need it anymore so I quit taking it. 30 days later I had a psychotic break. I felt ok up until then. It was like a switch went off in my head and I started having severe hallucinations. I asked the doctor why it took 30 days. I was told that it is built up and store in your fat cells. It takes time for it to get out of your system. The second psychotic break was really difficult to come back from.
174376237,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The effect of minocycline on amelioration of cognitive deficits and pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Aug 2019 12 Cognitive deficits of schizophrenia are predictors of poor function, but antipsychotic medication has limited efficacy for cognitive deficits. These deficits in learning and memory may result from activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which microglia produce. The microglia inhibitor minocycline might arrest this cytokine damage to the hippocampus and reverse the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia.A double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 75 patients with schizophrenia who randomly received low dose (100?mg/day) or high dose minocycline (200?mg/day) or placebo added to risperidone. MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) was used to assess the cognitive functioning, and serum levels of Interleukin-1? (IL-1?), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor ne

RESULTS: Minocyclinehigh dose group was significantly superior to minocyclinelow doseor placebo group not only for the improvements in cognitive tests’ scores as well (P < 0.05), but for IL-1? and IL-6 serum levels reduction (P < 0.01).

176134130,There’s a real dichotomy within me. On one hand I feel worthless and beneath others and on the other hand I feel superior. It’s weird. I never have been able to figure it out. When dealing with other’s I will be thinking am I good enough and stressing about it and all of a sudden I flip over and get defensive and say well they did this and they did that and they aren’t good enough for me.

174376250,"I would not do this. There have not been human trials. You do not know what you are getting. It’s almost certainly a ripoff and quite possibly dangerous. There are issues with stem cells - if they come from yourself, they still have the same issues your own cells have. If they come from someone else, there are rejection issues. If it were a real therapy with cells from someone else, you would have to take anti-rejection pills which would reduce your immune response. These are issues that are being worked on, but these are not things that are available now. Unfortunately I think this is a scam and we all just have to wait for medical science to advance. There will be big headlines and articles in major scientific journals when and if a proven therapy of this kind really works."
176134134,"I don’t know if you are a bad person or not but the first step to being a good person is to stop doing bad things and start doing good things. The second step may be making amends to anyone you hurt or did bad things to. This could be a face-to-face apology, an apology in a letter or paying someone back money, or confessing to something you did wrong. If you want to feel good about yourself and ease a guilty conscience then try to get out of your head and maybe help others. Volunteer at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter. Or at a wildlife rescue center."
174376241,You have schizophrenia not missing ventricles or whatever. You’re in that part of the disease process where you have no energy and can’t make any forward momentum to help yourself. It will work itself out to where you eventually get better a little at a time and work yourself out of bed and back to a more normal life I hope and pray.
176134135,Glad to hear it _AT_MENTION_ I hope it continues. People need some hope.

176134141,I think that it’s more likely that you’ll experience hypomania before it turns into full blown mania and antipsychotics have mood stabilising properties. I know for me who has SZA - BD type who experiences hypomania and mania and on Invega depot this controls the mood swings alone without mood stabiliser.

174376247,The FDA and Health Canada say these addiction and hypersexuality problems are uncontrollable and they stop once Abilify is stopped. Are they really uncontrollable like they say?
176134169,But probably not till millions of jobs are lost and many people suffering that consequence before they finally do it. I bet they’ll do it the latest moment they can.
176134170,Certain antipsychotics cause that. You might have to change.

174376253,I must admit that i dont know much on the subject. But personally have been subject to _USER_ID_ - and name calling about my diagnosis on many an occasion - especially in bars round here from people that know me.

176134174,"A friend of mine lost his whole family a few years ago. His mother, his father and his only brother all died within 8 months of each other. He was in a very dark place, and I thought I was going to lose him. So I walked with him through hell for 2 and 1/2 years, often encouraged him to get a therapist because it was too much to handle. But he is from a social work background, and has an arrogance about him that he thinks he knows everything He’s come through the worst of it, though I know he’s still depressed. But he’s heavily into drugs, and wallows in self-pity constantly. I could say I just got shot in the face, and within 30 seconds he would _USER_ID_ it around to be all about him. It’s gone from sad, to tiresome to pathetic. I think I’m just burned out from listening to him for so long, but I have lost all sympathy for him. He refuses to lift a single finger to help himself, but expects the whole world to pity him as if he’s the only one that has problems. That might sound a little 
harsh, but there is a long history that pre-dates this, of him thinking he’s special somehow, and shouldn’t have to suffer like everyone else I’m burned out, I’m tired of it, and I need a break. My fear is that without me he might backslide, but I really feel like I need to save my own ass right now. I just can’t take any more of it The moral dilemma is: If you save a man’s life, you become responsible for it Or… I’ve done my part, I am out"

I tried and it just triggered my symptoms and made things worse. I used to be very sharp and great with a lot of things but now I’m not the same anymore. I usually work 42 hours a week sometimes more but I try to maintain my independence and not ask my parents for much.
174376265,"Before 2015, my doctors questioned if I EVER had psychosis. A lot of them thought I was manipulating, lying, or even messing around with them because I thought they weren’t real and I had undifferentiated schizophrenia. Then in 2015, I had several _NAME_ experiences in the mental hospital. I had paranoia about the CIA during the time following me around (typical of paranoid schizophrenics), and my doctor gave me 10 mg of Adderall. I saw a woman in camo at the mental hospital and PTSD patients from war. I was suffering from severe paranoia and delusions. I thought I was going to die there because I was getting paranoid memories of past lives where I died in the mental hospital by a former patient/roommate. Not only that, but the hospital was bringing in drug addicts from the street to get extra money from the government. I was scared of them. They looked scary. A lot of them (most) were homeless. I thought they were going to make me disappear. I thought one of the staff members took down a camera, 
the cameras were either duds or fakes, and the security too loose. Patients were coming in and out of the hospital at will and I was saying paranoid ???? that now resembles MK-Ultra or worse. I guess those memories all came in at once like a flood gate was opened. I started saying weird, paranoid ????. I got threatened or overheard patients (I think) talking about me like they were going to take me out of the country and make me disappear. I thought it was a huge, grand conspiracy that all revolved around me. I got paranoid because my mom’s car shifted accidentally by itself and I think I might have seen some UFOs around that time. I’m not sure. Instead of CIA, it could have been aliens though. I believe we live in a computer simulation. I wrote in my journals about my paranoia and ????. I have since destroyed them (soon after or around the time I was there). I believe I was getting severely paranoid past life memories and suffered from severe thought broadcasting and other stuff. A lot of this stuff rese
mbled what people call Gangstalking. The meds were not working despite being on high doses. It was like water or sugar. I died there a lot. I think it was 2015 and I died there thousands of times. I guess you can blame the grey aliens for sending me back at the mental hospital in different timelines. To be honest, I think it was because something happened to me in college back in 2011. I also think I was in the SSP in Project Moon Shadow and possibly Monarch too. I was in Montauk Project too in a past life. All as a victim. Yes, the medication eventually worked but the adderall must have been the culprit. I tried joining the military there in a past life and was killed in the shower by the patients there. It’s possible I have screened memories of the incident but it was the worse such experience in my entire life. The severe, disabling paranoia is gone but I still have residual paranoia. I don’t know why I was targeted or so paranoid unless you think it’s paranormal or God doing it to me. I honestly bel
ieve (now looking back) that it was because I was _NAME_, the twice rigged election was coming up, and because what they did to me in college back in 2011. I had no memories of the incident until 2015/2016. I was completely mind wiped until then. The adderall they gave me or the soldiers there must have triggered severe ??????? memories. I even thought I saw a clone. The woman in camo made me freak out to the point where I almost did not go there. I think it’s because she said “I’m really getting tired of coming here” and looked right at me. At the time, I was reading in people’s conversations too much, believed I lived in the Matrix, and was in an infinite time loop. It took 6 years to finally find a medication that worked and that was Vraylar. So yes, the medications do work. But it usually takes years to find the right meds and combos."

176134209,"I got the Sony HT-G700 sound bar. I almost got a 5.1 system but I’m in the living room of a small one bedroom apartment so an all-in-one sound bar seemed like a better idea. It can decode Dolby Atmos and DTS and allegedly simulate the effects of upward firing speakers. I read some really good reviews on it. I don’t really have the money or space for something with multiple speakers to work well for me, so this seemed like a good deal. It does come with a wireless sub which I’ll probably turn down to a low setting."

176134214,The course of our lives depends on our circumstances. My life has been a combination of suffering/not suffering due to the meds making the schizophrenia less difficult than it could have been. Before the schizophrenia life was better but at times suffering happened. I think for the majority of people life is a combination of the two. But I also feel that pure suffering can occur for some very unfortunate people.

Had 2 156mg shots of Invega and 1 117mg. I didn’t realize anything was wrong until I started to feel more alive and interested in things again after 6 months of being off Invega. Just about 12 months of now. Still struggle with motivation and energy as I’m still on an AP that blocks dopamine, but it’s a serotonin agonist which explains why I feel lively and interested again, like before other antipsychotics like Haldol and Fluphenazine or however you spell it.

I did not like modafinil because it would wear off so fast but I’m very happy w armodafinil. With any stimulant, your body can build tolerance. They are not like other psych meds, for these meds “holidays” are actually recommended where you go off them for a weekend so you lose the tolerance. Then go back on. I’ve not really had to do that with armodafinil though. Its hugely changed my life. But I have narcolepsy. It makes it so I don’t just sleep all day and can actually have a life. Interestingly it also greatly reduced my hallucinations. But again we don’t know how much of my psychosis is actually psychosis and how much is narcolepsy."

176134259,I used to get paranoid that someone was bombing the World Trade Center but I was really bullied when I was young and it gave me paranoia. I was shamed and shunned as a kid.
176134260,_PERSON_ yeah preach. I can be so so nasty to myself. I hold myself to completely unrealistic standards and constantly expect myself to be this perfect human being and then beat myself to a pulp when I inevitably fail to meet those standards.

I started feeling better after getting home, eating lunch, and having a cup of coffee."

176134268,"sorry to hear you feel like no one wants to talk to you =( personally i can’t know how it feels cause i live with my parents and they still talk to me, we don’t talk often though cause they think talking with me is hard but i have their company though.

176134280,"_AT_MENTION_ , Do you feel like an “open book”? Like strangers know everything about you? I used to have that symptom. It is really scary and it is paranoia. It took me a total of three AP’s to get rid of all of my paranoia. I’m now on Risperdal Consta, Geodon and Seroquel. If you ask me my opinion of Seroquel, I love it. It’s the final drug I was placed on that did the trick of getting rid of my paranoia. I love it because it also helps me to sleep at night. A bonus effect."

176134285,"I don’t want to sound critical. But, research should focus on the prevention of schizophrenia, not its aftermath. I think once one becomes ill, it is hard to recover. I think prevention should be a priority. All these medications make the pharmaceutical companies richer. I see the reason for developing these medications- profit. If these companies had any compassion, they would put their profits into researching the prevention of schizophrenia. Yes, newer medications make a lot of money. New patents are profitable for 20 years or so. But, these new medications all have side effects and some are just modified versions of previous medications. Money is the motivation, not our well-being. I don’t want to be a walking pharmacy. I am disgusted by the perspective that making newer medication is key to our recovery. There are many medications now on the market. More medication does not mean that we will have success with all of them. After awhile, there will be a candy store variety of medications for 
psychosis. Are you kidding me? I am critical because I used to take many medications without much success. Now, I take one- only one- and am doing fine. I don’t believe that these newer medications are that much different from the previous ones. Stop this nonsense!"

174376283,"Brain & Behavior Research Foundation – 1 Aug 19 A Way of Predicting if New Psychosis Patients Will or Won’t Respond to... “Trial and error” remains the basis for care of people who have recently been diagnosed with psychosis, and “poor outcomes are common,” say a team of researchers at the University of California, _NAME_, led by BBRF Scientific Council member _NAME_... This is cool not only because of the possibility they could stop with the trial and error, but because there’s a brain region that’s a biomarker for improvment in cognitive control. Other medications besides clozapine could be tested quicker by looking at that biomarker in early studies. Participants were asked to perform a cognitive task involving pressing buttons while they were undergoing their fMRI scan. Results showed that psychosis patients with greater activation in the frontoparietal region during this task were more likely to show symptomatic improvement at their 1-year follow-up. Just as important, the test 
also showed that poor activation in the same brain circuitry corresponded with poor response to treatment. Discovery of this fMRI brain signal raises the question of which treatments are most effective in increasing activation in the frontoparietal region. The antipsychotic medicine clozapine has been shown to have the desired effect, but it is usually prescribed only for patients who are not helped by other medicines, due to its potentially dangerous side effects and need for constant monitoring. Other forms of treatment could be tested in the future for their impact on the signal. The importance of the study, the team suggested, was in demonstrating the frontoparietal fMRI signal as an objective biomarker, implicating that region mechanistically in psychosis pathology and relating it to symptoms in psychosis patients."

I feel low functioning, I have to use modafinil a lot to keep myself going, and it’s not a harm. It’s just expensive. There’s people worse off than me, but if this illness has taught me anything, it’s that I only have myself and therefore should get the most out of myself by myself. Because I find dependency on family for emotional support emasculating. How am I meant to not seek a way out of this, because sometimes, and oftentimes, I feel leaving the world/this life is the best course of action. PS: I found out roughly how much income my crush has, and came to the realisation I may never match up and be able to provide for her.

176134373,? had tried haldol for 2 mg before and my brain was so irritating that i will lose my mind. ?t was horrible. My question is this feeling past away later
176134374,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ - I see you’ve been thinking about Native Americans lately! I had to chime in bc there was a flick I was able to take in about a month ago on _PERSON_ and the 7th Cavalry. It’s called “Son of the Morning Star” a two part movie that was made in like 1990… it has some 80s type sounds throughout. Apparently _PERSON_ didn’t even suffer a scratch in the Civil War, which dumbfounded people, and I think the story goes he was promoted. The movie portrays him sympathetically, apparently I think it was the plains Indians - the _NAME_ sort of fell back - and grouped with The Sioux, but they didn’t scalp him. The movie attempts storytelling from both sides and does have nuances… I would say try the movie, but it’s difficult to find. We got a copy from some Vermont movie store, but the video had aged a lot - so not as good as when they showed it to us in the 6th grade."

I constantly try to be mindful of each of my thoughts, and what I say. I share with a community and try my best to give back for when I have to take.

176134390,"Aw, _USER_ID_ I feel bad for you! I’m going to guess by your posts that you are very young! Probably under 21? Was this the first time your family went out of town without you? That would be pretty scary at a young age for the first time especially with an illness like you have. Maybe you should be honest with your family and tell them you’re not quite ready to be alone yet! They’ll probably understand. As for your neighbors that made me giggle. . Just so you know it’s not in the least bit creepy to celebrate on the 4th with alcohol and fireworks! That’s pretty normal behavior. I did that with some family and neighbors on the 4th along with most of the other people in the neighborhood. Actually your neighbors sound pretty fun. Unless they were sitting outside your front door then I could see that being weird. However, what is creepy is you driving around the middle of the night thinking about sleepy in a gas station parking lot or getting a hotel by yourself. That could be very dangerous 
and I don’t think your parents would like that at all! Talk with your family and let them know you’re not quite ready to be alone."

176134392,I think veganism is kinda cool but overall I would not do it. I don’t believe in supplements and fortified food.

176134404,Invega totally killed my desire. It has a history of lowered libido as a side effect. Who told you it’d help with sex?

176134408,Try eating out. Go to a movie. Watch a sunrise or a _USER_ID_. Talk to your pdoc about it. They might know a good antidepressant for you.
176134409,Yep. Only at high school level but played in the south of Scotland team against the welsh under 16 team. Pretty proud of that

176134414,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ . What happens is as follows. Medications are a very bad idea for me, because my baseline physical level without medications is rather low. Furthermore, the side that is ostensibly the strength of medications, which is the cognitive side, is irrelevant for me because my level of stamina for cognitive work is very low. Regarding why my brainwashing is hostile, I also have an explanation. As a rule, people have hostile brainwashing when they have poor capacity to function. Some people avoid that, but that requires a combination( ??????? in Hebrew), a combination that no one is willing to give me."
176134415,How many hours do you sleep usually?
176134416,mornings are really bad for me. Nights i tend to be ok
176134417,I meditate quite often.
176134418,"As my clinical psychologist is looking into considering me for a diagnosis of autism, I am relieved to know now what could be the issue. It just makes sense why I’m different. I feel like I’ve been hating myself so long because I’ve been trying to be someone im not just to fit in… If I do get diagnosed on Friday I will focus on my strengths and work out what to do from there… I hope for more help with life skills etc but I’m feeling much more positive and its not that I have not been trying but I’ve been trying and working extra hard (mask) to appear normal …"

176134421,"I got diagnosed with sleep apnea a couple years back. Incidentally, after I started wearing my c-pap mask every night, I stopped having psychotic symptoms. My diagnosis has now been changed to reflect that my psychotic symptoms were a result of chronic sleep deprivation, rather than schizophrenia."
176134422,I think that _AT_MENTION_ suggestion is a very good plan.
176134423,"This isn’t like pulling things out the bag, or a hat and calling it all true. This is from experiences I’ve gained in myself to trust my gut, my intuition has rarely failed me, only the schizophrenia has. but I guess I’ve already said this. I’ll tell you what, you believe you, and I’ll believe me."
176134424,Ok thankyou. I will keep that in mind.

176134432,Sorry I forgot I also walked with my sisters dog. Forgot to mention her.(sorry sisters dog) It was a pleasure to walk with you too?:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
176134433,good luck! I hope it helps you.
176134434,Yes I get along better with my mum now she is single I think. But we had n have a awkward relationship even when she is single but it’s better than when she has a abusive partner.he never abused her n she said she would leave him if he did n I thought thanks you let him abuse me though… It sucks when they always put their boyfriends husbands wife’s girlfriend first and if they are abusive they never defend you and when they are mocking your pain laugh at you not with you but at you and your suffering. My dad pretty much said he left his kids out of his will. He used to be rich but gave a house to his x and money to his other x and is giving all he has to his wife cause he is scared she will leave him. We don’t get anything. He openly says he never wanted children though. I love them all unconditionally but happy to not have to live with them anymore. I’m glad you are in good relationship with your mum now. You must miss her if you haven’t seen her for a year.
176134435,I’m sorry you struggled with that. It’s hard to grow up that way

176134441,My little dog sits next to me and does a single “woof” every 30 seconds or so until I get up. She can keep this up for 10 minutes or more. The problem is that sometimes it’s at 3am in the morning. Then she just wants to play–often she doesn’t even need to go potty.
176134442,I have a neurodegenerative condition. As a result my health tends to be very poor.
176134443,You mean a change in the adn of a cell? From what you’ve said I understand that antipsychotics block old disfunctional pattern in the brain and make the brain use the functional ones more and more until it reached a point when them are the only one used in the procces of function. Did I understood right? I have zero knologe in the chemical procces of antipsychotics in the brain.
176134444,"I never drank a lot of soda, but I liked a can a day or so. To stop drinking it I cut it all out for 2 weeks. Then when I would get a craving I would drink a seltzer. I didn’t used to like seltzers that much, but after I got used to not having so much sugar they tasted a lot better."

I also stopped seeing bad friends and all my friends to focus on work. Its been a year and a half and still going strong on Latuda 80mg. I quit 15 diff. jobs, physio 32$/h etc, I rage quit because I can’t make friends or socialize. I feel rejected and lonely at work. I know twins with SZ that are like me but worse, they smoke weed and destroy walls, furniture and electronics when they rage at home. All they do is play videogames. I will wait and see if I get better or if Xanomeline, new AP, works like Abilify without nasty side effects."
176134446,I think about the next life because this one sucks. Well it doesn’t suck it’s just boring. But then I think about my son soon to be born and I keep going.
176134447,My grandmother passed away this afternoon eastern Europe time. In the end I’m happy she died of old age.
176134448,I was a doofus before meds. Plenty smart enough but couldn’t follow through with anything to any level. I was smart enough to know a lot of stuff but the important things. I was smart enough to get me in trouble and foil every relationship I ever had… Truly. On meds I miss that energy but I’ve way better relationships. I got married. I did well in work. I did well in sport. I don’t regret that change and yeah I miss that energy but I don’t miss being a doofus.

It’s because stress causes brain inflammation which generates excess adrenaline that doesn’t clear out properly, which oxidizes and forms adrenochrome. That causes you to have an LSD like trip while you are inflamed, which is like opening a spiritual door to the divine. Then you start syncing."
176134459,"Nah, you can definitely be breathing your own farts too much, and then get a wiff of something that makes you go, right, well thats heinous enough I gotta make some changes.

176134470,"People might argue that being able to successfully set goals is to have found them. And I suspect the success of that goal-setting will depend on the nature and strength of our ontological commitments, an individual purpose that partakes of a more transcendental purpose outside us, or, at least the very least, not identical to us. There is something perplexing about the idea of our life having purpose if we happen to believe nothing else does. Of course, you could always go all heroic and nietzschean about it but such an argument is designed to arouse rather than to persuade. What’s your personal take on the problem of purpose?"

Usually we can go to the immediate care center for xrays and labs. Super easy. But right now all the immediate care centers aren’t doing outpatient labs of any sort and while we were there (little LED wanted a snack and we don’t let her eat in the car so we sat on the grass away from the doors) a few people came up to be seen at the immediate care and they sent them away and told them that since it wasn’t an issue that needed a doctor to physically see them they needed to call this number they were handing out. Anyways, we had to go to the hospital for xrays and then we went to the immediate care for labs because I understood wrong where we were supposed to go. We went to Sunnyside, but we were supposed to go to Sunnybrook. Oops. Or something like that. Anyways, we had to go to this huge medial center for blood work. It was terrifying the whole time b

174376359,You don’t get schizophrenia. You have had it the whole time.
176134583,people told me about my delusions and that they were delusions but i still have a hard time admitting they were delusions. The time in the psych ward helped me though to not keep obsessing so much over them. Now on the right meds i don’t obsess much over them and so it doesn’t become a problem.
174376356,"Hello. I’m back from a break. I’m starting to believe I really do have psychosis or something along those lines. I recently quit my energy drink addiction and I feel better. I restarted my medication. I take Vraylar and Cymbalta. I think I need to find a new doctor. I don’t hallucinate or hear voices, but I have very low motivation and poor hygiene. Before I went back on meds and was drinking those drinks, I had bizarre thoughts and stuff. I had no increase in motivation off meds. I was thinking way too much. I kept thinking I was psychic and stuff like I could read people’s thoughts but they couldn’t read mine. That I was telepathic and stuff. I had bizarre theories about reality that I choose to ignore now. I rarely think about them. I guess I was messed up but I wasn’t suffering. I was happy just like I am now. I don’t do much. I like watching YouTube clips and stuff about TV shows. I get obsessed sometimes. I live in a fantasy world. I guess my favorite show is Lost. My favorite c
haracter is _NAME_, probably because he is immortal. My psychic abilities are 85-90% gone. I have barely any positive symptoms, except strange dreams. I have depression, low energy, no motivation, and no drive. I have no interest in working, although I like school sometimes. I fantasize about getting a BA in math or CS someday. I like practicing on Codecademy. If I ever work someday, it will be a menial job at Good Will, Dollar Tree, or Wal-_NAME_ or something. I’ve been having bizarre dreams but I try to ignore them. They don’t interest me at all. Since I quit the energy drinks and started taking Vraylar, they have decreased substantially. Without getting too out there, I sometimes think I’m going between parallel universes and such. But I feel like 85% normal now. Maybe the caffeine was causing the meds not to work or exacerbating the psychosis. I was drinking 6 monsters a day, not including coffee or soda. I like people, but I prefer to be alone. I sometimes think people don’t like me or that they 
hate me. I sometimes feel like I’ve given up on life. I’m seriously like 60-70% happy. I’ve improved so much since I found Vraylar like 3 years ago. My mood swings are down, but sometimes I get bursts or energy or something, but not much. I stopped all supplements. I don’t take anything besides Ashwaghanda. I replaced the monsters with a cheaper, safer alternative called Kickstarts. I drink less and I can afford them. They’re like a dollar each. Sometimes, I’m obsessed with the idea that I have ADHD and that I need Adderall to function or be successful, but I think it’s a lie. I have problems with thinking too much, too little, laughing at inappropriate times, zoning out, not listening to others when they are talking, day dreaming, and executive functioning like planning things and putting in effort. I sometimes upset my mom too. Thank You!"

So I cold turkey off it, tried vraylar in july and august, had a bad physical allergic reaction and that pdoc just told me to take 16 benadryl a day and upped the dose. I ended up in ER because of her and the ER did a hip I ejection wrong and activated the RSD into my right hip, so I’m on a cane. I just started driving again in January, but do as little as possible because everything hurts. I’ve been off APs since March other than the botched vraylar catastrophe.

176134605,"_NAME_ show is a great fictional film that inspires a lot of heavy thought. In 2012 I thought rich and powerful men were one step ahead of my every move. Even knowing which pack of smokes I would ultimately buy. I thought they were so powerful they were sabotaging the supply chain so the pack I smoked only had tar, and no nicotine, so that I would smoke more. In this delusion I asked my mom what a persons integrity is worth… bc I believed the cashier was in cahoots and I “estimated’ he was going along with it for 15 dollars a pop. I loathe the word projection, but I will off that overall my world view was seriously shot at the time."

Endogamy is common in many cultures and ethnic groups. Several religious and ethnic religious groups are traditionally more endogamous, although sometimes with the added dimension of requiring marital religious conversion.

174376373,"I think smoking weed could be an issue like for CBT, or Logotherapy. Hallucinating on Marijuanna is like there are delusions, thought distortions, but also lack of insight, or disrupted and broken thinking. In Schizophrenia cases this should seem more Freudian, perhaps, or like you could analyze it with a _NAME_ personality test. Incidentally, there could be lack of insight from smoking weed, or heavier hallucinogenics like psilocybin, that resemble that hallucinations could build up as “Ghost in the Shell”, or “Nightmare on Elm Street” or could return when drinking cough syrup. As a Sz it should be frightening that looking at a comic strip in the newspaper is a repressed hallucination, years later, yet persons thinking on world events, or identifying other emotions such as in facial expressions is too insensitive to rationalists, for example, like _PERSON_, or _PERSON_. There is indeed cause for concern then regarding Marijuanna, compared with other drugs, perhaps LSD, or others, that the 
Sz symptoms could ruin something like The White Album by the Beatles, or Dark Side of the Moon by Pink _NAME_. Over all, then, there is some suspicion of Laissez Faire thinking creeping into the Sz symptoms that others tacitly consented to using Marijuanna, such as with L.S.D., perhaps like the hippies. I was most concerned that hippies smoking weed would confuse the effect of a collective unconscious like as “Pink _NAME_” music, like acid rock, or heavy metal, with the theory of the collective unconscious as globalization, where the collective unconscious shifts, even for the Sz based on shifts like the new economy, or mass production. Clearly, then, second generation Sz drugs are a shift in the collective unconscious just as manufacturing, or distribution, even without noting the effects of the drug, like when _NAME_ refers to Risperidone, or there is a Seroquel TV advertisement. Still, as when _NAME_ refers to L-Dopa in “Hallucinations”, it remains to be witnessed how persons would classify Marijua
nna since it is not as effective as L-Dopa, or perhaps _NAME_-E, like in cases of depression. I am confused about how _PERSON_ is good for depression, instead of _NAME_, or _PERSON_. In fact while healthy persons often tout marijuanna as a milder drug noting it could be legalized, or decriminalized, that I’m pretty sure it is not an antidepressant, and is worse than drinking Green Tea, or L-Theanine. So, as with man’s folly being sort of magnified with a magnifying glass, I should then magnify the folly of marijuanna as a religion, or religious movement for its disastrous impact on the Sz, or depressives. It’s very foolish like a person who is a wino on skid row, to play around with _PERSON_."

176134686,"First of all, last night I awoke at ten and took my meds. I went back to sleep, kind of, and got up at about two. I was not in the mood to do anything, there was a horror movie on tee vee but I chose to not watch it, so I was restless. I was so restless I felt like jumping out of my skin. A voice told me to work and I said at what? she said, whatever you do. I cleaned the kitchen reluctantly, but figgited for several hours and then practiced guitar. I told myself to shower and go for a walk but did not. I have not been outside today. I listened to some horror short stories on YouTube, audio only, one by _PERSON_. I had lunch and contemplated suicide. It relaxed me to do so, but then I realized I just didn’t want to make an effort anymore, to work. I thought, what if I died and found myself in the state I was in this morning, so restless I could jump out of my skin for many many years until I could reincarnate. A bad situation is better than no situation, someone once said. I _NAME_ two sketches a

174376397,"Cotton we’re pro medicine around here. I think you’re only talking coherently because you haven’t had more severe brain damage from psychosis. You’ve had symptoms since your first bout of psychosis so odds are you are schizophrenic. Not all types are the same, its more a cluster of symptoms but what you need to be focused on isn’t getting off the medications, but finding one you tolerate well or really well. I take my medications and feel completely normal. Worry about your dose argue for as light a dose as is effective in treating you, and if you have symptoms be quick to get an adjusted dose or to change medicines. I took 2 years to find latuda and latuda treats me well enough and I feel like a normal person. My imagination is a little duller which is lame but even though I was trying to become an artist, its not so bad that I feel like my life is in ruins. I’ve gotten back into art and I’ve done stuff creatively, and it just took a bit more effort to get there."

I’m schizophrenic. Plus I have brain and spinal cord damage from the fall that broke my neck. I walk with a limp and on some days a cane because I am mildly paralyzed. I’m 40 years old. I’ve already cleared this with my family and the friends I love most so your opinions won’t sway me. In ten years, if I am still suffering the agony of nerve pain just getting out of bed and such simple acts like getting clothes on my body or using the toilet… I’m going to want to die. I already want to die. I love my life but I can’t take it any more. I already almost did it once a few years back. This time it is planned and everyone I know agrees. It isn’t fair to expect me to live another 40 year
s like this. I promised my family and friends ten more good years but that’s all I want. I want out and my husband of twenty years is understanding. It is selfish of EVERYONE to expect me to stick around for them. In the past few years I have built up a rather large circle of friends for someone who has an aversion to people. I’m good at my job at McDonald’s if not a little slow from the pain. I’ll be happy in this world until my ten years are up. When that time comes my husband said exactly “we will move to Washington or somewhere where it is legal to do it medically” I want to go out with _PERSON_ but medically is probably faster and less painful. I might go to hell."

I also think Abilify contributes to my addictive behaviors as well. But its the only medication they will have me on and it seems to help with depression and irritability plus Im used to it. I feel weird when i dont take it. The withdrawal from abilify is like psychosis but i dont think i can manage at this point without it. My mom, on the other hand, should go back on haldol but no longer wants to take injections and no longer believes she is mentally ill. She also called my dad a loser. She has more insight, is exercising, stopped watching television. So on the surface its good, but she could become psychotic aga

176134719,"Silly Story really - Went down a newly opened bar, and drunk pilsner 0% all evening - and got accosted by a 25 year old woman, that said shes fascinated by me. Said she wanted my children - and she loved me. Apperantly shes been stalking me - and that explains why ive had a strange woman buzzing my door - asking for “rog” - she obviously dont know i changed my name to _NAME_. I know who it is - and kindly said im not interested in any kind of relationship - but we could meet for coffee. I think shes got issues - shes obviously seen me at the MH clinics - cos i simply dont go out the flat. Bless her tho - its nice to feel wanted. But shes clearly vulnerable - and im not the kind of chap to take advantage. Shes only a little one emotionally in my eyes. So i will meet her - but it will be only to guide her in the right direction. I dont want a woman (or man) - i want to keep a simple life. Made me smile tho."

I just took 2mg benztropine. _PERSON_ said its for tremors. I read online it helps akathisia. Its been 15min and I still have akathisia. How long does it takes to make effect?

176134737,I’m on 5mg olanzapine. I take it with amisulpride which is my main med. I tried olanzapine on its own at 10mg but it didn’t help much as it made me feel dead inside. So returned to amisulpride. However taking amisulpride on its own didn’t help completely as the depression was still a problem. So my pdoc at the time put me on olanzapine for that and it helps when I take a low dose with amisulpride.
176134738,Good luck with the treatment.

I’m back on my meds so hoping some of this might ease off in the next couple of weeks. I just have to get through it and I’ll definitely stay away from the conspiracy stuff.

When they see talk about sex, they can stop reading. If the mere mention of sex is enough to set them off, which is hard to imagine, then they shouldn’t be on forums at all. The world is full of adults talking about sex and we can’t put up warnings whenever that happens. Also, they could use parental controls."

174376450,NAC doesn’t seem to work well with abilify. I’d seriously avoid it if you’re taking abilify. The max dose of l-theanine you’re supposed to take in 24 hours is only 1200mg. If you take 1200mg/day of l-theanine then that’s a large amount. If you take a large amount of l-theanine then you have to taper it down to stop it otherwise you could go bananas.

Glad I didn’t do anything… I think people talk and if you litigate you can get black balled by industry! But while I was fantasizing about litigating this corporation I imagined myself getting their apology in the form of a settlement (the only way companies apologize), and having blank stares from people( the muckity mucks) while I attempted to leave the courtroom. It would be a gauntlet of non verbal leers and peers sitting in the (pews?) I dunno I was always too scared to notice the furniture in courtrooms!

176134984,I’d suspect it brings it’s own concerns for health. Nicotine is an insidious drug. It’s like heroin in it’s complications for health and it leads to unhealthy outcomes but just years later.

Overthere, mentally ill and disabled ppl who commit crimes are all sent to permanent mental hospital. They don’t get a chance to live in society like here in Canada. I find Canada laws are better but everyone’s culture has a role. I am sure that in poor countries mentally ill ppl die earlier and many are exploited/killed by mafia or criminal gangs. In Saudi Arabia, homosexuality is illegal and you get jailed for it. They used to execute them not long time ago."

Because I am in a hospital, this environment is in fact as suitable a place as any to try potentially “dangerous” things. However, the doctors seem to be afraid. One thing they have mentioned (or used as an excuse) is that sometimes after quitting and re-introducing clozapine, the drug does not work as well as the first time. I’m sure that is true, but deciding whether to take that risk should be up to me, because it’s I who has to live with it. I’d like to develop my medicinal regiment in collaboration, again, because it is I who has to live with it, and because I cannot write prescriptions myself. Otherwise, I would probably have quit it already “unilaterally”, because clozapine is not available as an injection. So they would have to switch to something else – I want to have a say in exactly what else, which i

I dropped out of college back then with a useless major. Sort of like English (Math). No offense. I would have done better doing engineering or computer science. Even business or economics. My grades sucked and I was pushing my abilities to the max trying to understand undergraduate math at a top university. The problem was they were using textbooks for graduate students even though they were normal classes. I think if I went to an easier school in my area, I would have done better and had less stress and might have graduated. I might have learned more too like absorbed more despite the lower quality of education. I wasn’t doing good with psychosis at all. I couldn’t tell what was real and I lost my sanity. I couldn’t read and keep up with the course work so I bailed lol. I cannot make money off math unless I tutored. It’s hard to get a go
od tutoring job at a company because I don’t have SAT scores nor do I have a degree. The competition is there. Plus, I struggle. I could do private tutoring but I don’t like it. I cannot even do basic hygiene tasks so I’m in no condition to work. I have a severe addiction to energy drinks that seems impossible to quit. Economics is great for stock market and trading because of theory and technical aspect. Business is useful because it’s easy and you can learn or master accounting or even finance. Even statistics seems useful and sexy. I would have loved to have been an electical engineer or computer engineer. Same thing with computer science. Lots of money and plus you learn to be a man and independent like building stuff with your hands. Like being self sufficient. I struggle now with changing oil. I probably couldn’t even do it because my dad never let me and thus I never learned ???? from him at all. My step father is teaching me stuff my real father neglected. It’s sad. If I ever go back to sc
hool, I’ll do online computer science. Not sure if I can even do it. The money is there (mostly in free money and loans) but I don’t know if I can mentally and physically do it anymore. It’s daunting. I don’t even know if I could work or get a job. If I did, it would be online and remote. Not really something I could get especially at a small company. My best and most unique scholarship with math tutor of the year. It really shocked me because there were many other choices – some better than me."

They always say they are going shoot me and my friend and also torture , as of yet nothing has happen, but I want them out of my mind first. They have been torturing me from the inside and yelling at me calling me a sorts of names, they even threaten to do something to my family, they are trying to touch me all the time Someone wants to have my face even though I am not that pretty, they want to eat my food and live in my body, I wish I had a stronger mind"

176135048,"Yeah it’s surprising how the calories add up. When I put every little thing into my calorie counter I’m floored by the calories in everything and how small a portion is. It’s no wonder I’m fat. An example is breakfast cereal. A serving may be one cup, well I pour 3 cups lol, I mean how is one cup of cereal suppose to fill you up?

If you look at the evolution, we spent most of the time in the hunter-gatherer phase. The diets brought on by agriculture and industry are very new to our diet. Our bodies did not evolve to consume lenoleic and oleic fatty acids in large numbers for example (industrial seed oils). These fatty acids are suspect for causing metabolic dysfunction. The chronic disease is on the rise since the advent of the industrial food manufacture, and it’s well-documented.

I’ve had to go to the DMV multiple times, several times to renew my license. I didn’t lie on any forms but the DMV has never asked if I have a mental illness. I’ve been driving all these years and I guess they don’t know. There was one incident where I was driving from my volunteer job with this guy from my group home. A cop pulled me over and everything was going fine and he just let me off with a warning. The cop was walking back to his car and the guy with me just started laughing loudly and uncontrollably. I was trying to get hm to shut up but the cop came back and somehow it came out that we were both mentally ill and on medication. The cop told us it was OK but all he said about it before he left was that If we ever drive erratically because of too much medication he could give me a ticket for DUI."

I asked my gf if she noticed any difference in me since i started the treatment and she said absolutely I have improved. i find i tend to forget about any improvments when i drop back down because those days it feels like as if i never did any treatment. but then i go back to feeling good. its very disorienting going through that. and it doesnt feel like when i cycled from hypomania to depression in the past. it just feels like going from really low to a close to normal state. now its the weekend, and on to week 6 on monday. cheers level"

The body needs time to adapt to the medication, so the chance of side effects will be highest when starting a medication.

Vraylar will give me the same problems as it doesn’t suppress emotions. My parents want me to stay on Risperdal. Risperdal blocks emotions by blocking the limbic system in the brain and blocks the reward/pleasure and addiction centers in the brain (mesolimbic pathway): “This drug has “tight binding” properties, which means it has a long half-life and like other antipsychotics, risperidone blocks the mesolimbic pathway, the prefrontal cortex limbic pathway, and the tuberoinfundibular pathway in the central nervous system.” en.wikipedia.org Risperidone Risperidone, sold under the brand name Risperdal among others, is an atypical antipsychotic.

Its best to take it when needed only I mean when need to do some energy demanding work, social situation etc. Also useful when have depressed mood. Useful for improving libido also. Taking daily might reduce its effectiveness also if take it continuously can disrupt night sleep as this stuff gives energy. Bit like a stimulant. For me the effect last almost 1 full day and half thus this stuff can easily mess with sleep. May be reducing the dose can help. I tried with 500 mg and still pretty strong."

Hopefully the rest of your classes won’t be via Zoom, because there seems to be a couple of vaccines on the way for COVID-19 and these are likely to be highly effective (I’ve heard about 95%). I want to get a degree but feel a bit too old. I’m 32, I’ll be 33 in July.Interesting you are studying Art History, my sister teaches American students at the University of Oxford (UK), she has a PhD in History of Art. My brother studied his undergraduate degree at Oxford, also. I on the other hand do possess a growth mindset in terms of my capabilities, but realistically I could never compare. I read an interesting article about Maths anxiety and how people who see themselves as simply “good or bad at Maths”, tend not to have a growth mindset and often struggle. My education was disrupted because I went to Thailand as a school student and kept on failing Mathematics. I did not have anxiety, but it was International examinations, whereby the standard in such Asian count
ries is a lot higher. So I learnt nothing. Eventually I got my C grade at Mathematics. There’s even a UK edition of the book “AS and A-level Maths for dummies”, which is what many take after the age of 16. I’m going to work through it and see if I make enough progress to eventually sit the exams. Online courses are also very useful and the course content, at least for Computer Science, is often more up-to-date than that of many universities."

I would say, keep using as the dr says so, let them know the issues and see what happens as your body becomes more attuned to the use of it.

In Sweden I rented of the government second hand then first hand contract. I would be incredibly poor if I didn’t get help. I don’t want to rent a room and hear others have sex or get annoyed with me etc There are homes for disabled people where you get your own apartment but you have staff 24/7 in a neighboring building.

176135166,"I have had altered states of consciousness where I was remembering my parallel lives (the same life as I’m living now, but with different outcomes and events, and different relationships). In one of my parallel lives I had psychic/telekinetic abilities and I raised hell in order to raise the vibration of everyone on the planet to that of the spiritual realm, so there would be more happiness in the world and so everyone could communicate with their loves ones on the other side. My voices spoke to me about hell and Satanism, as well as Spirituality. Sometimes as I was remembering an event from one of my other lives the voices of those I had experienced that life with spoke to the other voices with me about it, almost providing a firsthand narrative to go along with my own. I’d like to think that in those instances the voices that I was hearing did indeed come from a higher dimension, where those lives did probably happen."

I got out and got “stable” and I thought I would never be hospitalized again. But in 1989 I was hospitalized several more times. I remember entering one hospital and I was placed on a mandatory 72 hour hold before I talked to a doctor about getting out. After three days I thought I was getting released. I went in the docs office and he told me I wasn’t ready to get out and he was placing me on another 72 hour hold. I got angry and agitated and told him they promised I could leave and that I was perfectly fine. His answer was that just the fact that I was angry and agitated showed I wasn’t ready to get out and that if I wasn’t careful he had a right to impose a 14 day hold on me. Catch-22 I was so angry that I went in my room and punched the wall. Almost immediately an orderly poked his head in and asked what was that noise. I said it wasn’t me though I was the only one 
in the room, lol. I realized my mistake was getting angry at the doc so when 72 hours was up I talked to him again and I was cool, calm, and collected. It worked and they released me."

176135200,"if I remember correctly I got “relief” in like the first 1-3 months, would occasionally get some breakthrough voices every now and then and still do sometimes but they are infrequent, like once a month. and then for like a year or more my inner voices were still there if I focused but I couldn’t really make out what they were saying. it was just a jumbled whisper and didn’t cause me any problems. 2 years on it now and I no longer get those whispers in the background. I feel cured and closer to normal."

176135216,_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry to hear about your friend
176135217,It depends when you need to get up and how much sleep you need. Lots of people need to get up early for work or school and most people need 8 or 9 hours of sleep. I heard it’s best to go to sleep before midnight but I’m not quite sure why unless you need to get up early.

Since and at present she has a demanding office job, around sixty hours a week. Her delusions remain the same."

176135230,My ex fiance started talking to me in when I was in the hospital. She died years ago I missed the funeral and only know that she died unexpectedly at home. She said she was still alive and working as a prostitute for this shadowy organization. That was very pnainful after a while. So really this is like she’s in another world. I don’t think they faked her death. She’d be older now too like late 50’s so that’s pretty old for a prostitute.
174376523,"Sometimes I see delusional individuals post repeatedly about their delusions, and I find it kind of triggering even if I don’t suffer from those delusions. (And some might say, if I’m that sensitive maybe I should find somewhere else to hang) I realise there should be room for those too, just like we have room for people who aren’t really schizophrenic, or don’t receive medical treatment. But many of those afforementioned delusional individuals seem to post here with no intention of doing anything to recover or break free from the delusions although this is supposed to be a recovery oriented forum. No therapy, no cognitive exercises, no talking sense or logic with them, etc. So my question is, should the mods do more to keep those people at bay? Maybe even silenced if they continue to rant semi-gibberish? Or am I just being a big old meanie and need to go back to my corner? Am I the only one with these thoughts?"

176135245,"Also, having a job isn’t the only way to make meaningful contributions. Something as simple as doing one chore every week, and then two chores a week, and then slowly increasing from there. You don’t have to be rich and powerful. But if you can just be able to help the other members of your house with the daily tasks, that is a start. I used to have a lot of trouble with chores, after my head injury. So I asked for one chore to be assigned to me. That was washing the dishes. I didn’t start out by washing all of them at once. I started by just unloading the dishwasher and putting things away. I did that for about a week, every single day. Then, I started loading, starting, and unloading the dishwasher. Then I worked my way up to washing the dishes that are too big for the dishwasher. Then I worked my way up to also wiping down countertops. Then I started doing my laundry, but leaving the clean laundry in the basket. Then, I started putting my clothes away. If you look at all the tasks you wish 
you could do, it seems impossible. So the trick is to break it down. Find a small task that actually seems possible for your level. Maybe you can start by taking your dishes to the sink every day. Or by sweeping or vacuuming your bedroom. Just some small thing that your parents usually do for you. And then build on it."

I’m definitely stable enough to live in community with other monks, but I’m not “stable” enough to live with either sides of my dysfunctional family.

176135324,I managed to get my own apartment with my cousin’s help. My fiancee C is living with me. I stopped taking my rexulti because it was so expensive. My parents are more than happy to pay for it but to be able to actually support myself I need to be able to pay for my medication myself. I am thinking about going back to the rexulti. I’m working on my second new antipsychotic and it is not pleasant. I don’t know if it’s ever been this bad or if I was so used to things going wonderfully that I forgot what bad looked like.

Like I’m not acute anymore and don’t have hallucinations or delusions (maybe flashbacks when triggered) but I live with negative symptoms every day. As for your husband I would suggest just be guided by your love. Be kind, be sensitive, be supportive, be compromising, be strong as best you can and all of that will return to you."

176135346,"Coincidences are like special interest or hobby in my case. I think that their influence on my level of functioning is significantly smaller than it looks. I have been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and OCD since above 10 years and I think that they have significantly more impact on my functioning than series of mysterious coincidences. I got medications mainly due to OCD (at the beginning clomipramine and fluvoxamine. later paroxetine which I get also now (40 mg daily at morning)) even before having coincidences, the doses were rather smaller than now and psychotropic drugs like olanzapine, sulpiride, chlorprothixene do not prevent from new coincs. But I want to not get even medications for OCD, because they may impact ability to drive a car and I think that having driving licence and possibility of driving a car would be really beneficial in finding a job. I have never driven a car although I am almost 28 years old. I live in small locality where there are no school or church. I have to rid
e by bus, which is accessible only on certain times of day (for example, last bus to my locality is about 9 p.m., so I could not finish my job at 10 p.m., because I would have not bus to go back to my village, job at weekends also could be really problematic). I have pretty good access to buses, which allowed me to study in nearest big city from 2010 to 2015 without living in that city, I still lived in my small locality then. If I had not coincidences, I still could have suspiciousness (which started when I was about 16), solipsistic or egotheistic ideas (which were present before 18th birthday), thoughts about grandiosity (grandiose and bizarre fantasies were present in me when I was about 12) and messengership (for which coincidences may be very good “fuel”). So maybe I would receive diagnosis of schizotypal disorder even without coincidences. Coincidences may be associated with delusions of reference and apostleship, though. Even some phenomena which are not a sign of mental disorders may impact my fu
nctioning significantly, like believing in possibility of eternal damnation associated with endless torment. I noticed some other references to 12.4 in numbers associated with my coincidences: sum of digits of “miraculous geometric sequence” (21, 42, 84) is 147 - digits in the 147 form arithmetic sequence with sum 12 and arithmetic mean 4 first digits in sequence 33, 42, 51 (3, 4, 5) form arithmetic sequence with sum 12 and arithmetic mean 4 sums of digits in sequence 6, 13, 20 (6, 4, 2) form arithmetic sequence with sum 12 and arithmetic mean 4 sums of digits in sequence 2, 31, 60 (2, 4, 6), which is formed by the same digits as 6, 13, 20, form arithmetic sequence with sum 12 and arithmetic mean 4 sums of digits in sequences 0, 13, 26 and 0, 31, 62 (0, 4, 8) form arithmetic sequence with sum 12 and arithmetic mean 4 I also noticed that there is another double which have the same product of digits, difference and arithmetic mean, but it is formed by two THE SAME numbers, in addition, one-digit ones. It is 
0 and 0. (0+0):2 = 0 = 0-0 = 0x0. I suppose that 21.7 and 12.4 may be only doubles formed by different numbers which have these three properties. I discovered some mathematical curiosities due to my “coincidences”, but if someone also noticed them? I suppose that very few people (or maybe even none before me) noticed them in the entire history. My mentality considers my numerous coincs as somewhat very epic and beautiful , sort of compensation of existence of sin and pain."

Then I got sidetracked, first with my Master’s and later with mental illness. Oddly enough my nurse keeps reminding me about it and I find myself explaining to her that I don’t seem to find the motivation to finish the ‘bible’ (synopsis, pitch, breakdown of characters, summary of the entire first season, etc.), let alone to get out there in the shared world and try to sell it. Not only do I lack the motivation but I seemed to have stopped caring almost completely. Clearly I have underestimated the effect negative symptoms have had on my entire outlook of life. So I have started worrying, feeling that a potentially good thing might go to waste. Do you have any suggestions on how I might get my motivation back? Thanks."

With the CBD I haven’t really noticed any changes in my appetite maybe Some it seemed to decrease it and I am not over eating when I eat dinner I get full faster or its just because of the weight I lost I get full fast and cant hold as much. I don’t know or combo of both and I decreases my anxiety and paranoia to zero or almost zero and helps me sleep that’s all I have noticed with using it. No Weight loss maybe that will come later with the CBD or without it if I do stop taking it, I just don’t know what I should do until I discuss it with my Dr. when I get to see her Maybe she can help me decide on what to do about CBD To continue it or stop it or take it instead of one of my meds."

174376573,"I have previously had what were probably psychotic episodes, I certainly had the delusional thinking for a while as I believed many conspiracy theories. I didn’t seem to put too much thought into a schizophrenia diagnosis at the first hospital I was in. That lead to me thinking I had brain damage from a car wreck I had 2 years before which then morphed into me thinking I was sundowning and had early onset dementia - both of these were delusions. I also thought my phone was hacked and that it was going to be the end times and I had some bad times because of that. Luckily after walking the railroad tracks for 8 hours I was picked up by cops and taken to the hospital which I tried to escape from through the ceiling. That didn’t work and to make a long story short, after roughing up two cops who I thought were taking me to an incenarator I was given IV Zyprexa and strapped to a board overnight. The meds worked and I began to realize that I was there for a reason. After 2nd hospitalization I was giv
en injection Invega and had the delusional idea that it was actually meth and that I was reincarnated _PERSON_ and they were trying to get me up and going for WWIII. This didn’t set off alarm bells but when I thought the TV was talking to me and that I wrote songs through time travel then I guess something clicked and I voluntarily went to the hospital and after that last round I haven’t went back and that was 2 years ago. I had to get out at least part of my story on here at some point, I figured this thread is as good as any."

Anyhow giving Alli another try plus I haven’t been to the gym in a few days but usually I am real dedicated in going three days a week to the gym may go tomorrow the reason I missed a few days is my back had been hurting but Its better than it was so I may go tomorrow to the gym to work the pain out in my back that’s still there. My meds in the beginning were horrible for weight gain and f
or not being able to lose until I had gotten used to them the side effects of weight gain went away I take Abilify5mg one and half tablets at bedtime and 20mg of Lexapro which seems low but it was even lower than that until the smallest dose I was on was 5 mg Abilify and 10 Lexapro but since That no longer works I am at a higher dose now but still its a rather low dose. I will keep on going to the gym if it wasn’t for the gym I wouldn’t have lost what I have so far I just don’t want to gain it back that would be upsetting to me and a big let down.

176135559,"That definition is accurate in some cases, but in my case I never really had the delusion that someone was reading my thoughts, or that I was being controlled outwardly. However, “normally tacit experiences intrude to the forefront of their attention” rings true, for example over a decade ago I had a delusion that I was the centre of a revolution and I was telepathically communicating with others in a subtle way, like not direct telepathy, but the part that rings true is that I would see subtle body language of others as clear signals that they got my messages. So some parts of the definition are good but might be too general."

It’s through my counselor who says they know your disabled and get a check but just want you to tell them some jobs you might be good at. Now about me. Obviously I have szoaffective and am real sensitive so I would need to work around a small group of people that I don’t see much of.I can do small task like around an office cause I’ve figured working in the summer sun drains me to the point I lose my common sense and do dumb stuff or think it as well. Although I’m not sure am office will stop that much either but might feel better for me I’ve thought if a couple jobs like meals on wheels for seniors where I would be delivering meals.

176135610,"I’ve been thinking about the world, humanity, what’s going to happen to us, whether or not we can be saved. Everything’s so fu cked up, I feel it, and I worry that we may be reaching the point of no return. But the I got to thinking about the moral version of the “point of no return.” Do we even deserve to survive? We don’t do our best. Not even close, really. I don’t do my best either. We live in an imperfect world, so of course, we are imperfect, but should we not strive to do better? Do better than you did yesterday, be better than you were yesterday; are these not our modern proverbial rules to live by? But I fall short. We all fall short, actually, and while I don’t imagine we are outright rejecting moral law, I do believe that we ignore it, and I believe we ignore it because it’s easier to act like morality doesn’t exist than it is to admit any personal responsibility in the evil acts of men. We all do it. But were we built that way, or did we evolve to be this way? And th
e more I think, the more I feel that I am a sh it human being. I’ve always had this sort of guilt complex that came along with my obsessions and delusions, but this is different; this is real. I seem to love myself more than I love others, and while this in and of itself isn’t inherently bad, its implications are. Would I go without water so that someone else could drink? Would I walk through a fire to save a trapped child? Would I give my life to save the life of another? Are these the types of things that God has called me to do? Something about righteous sacrifice? Is that why I was given such a conscience? One that pains me greatly when I fail to achieve moral perfection? I am in agony. I feel so ill that I may just throw up. I can’t handle it. And the worst part is that any attempts to ease this guilt only make things worse, because kindness is really only kindness when it’s done for another person and not for you. I don’t know what to do."

When you apply your beliefs to your own experience you are going on a deep end into a conceptual space that in all likelyhood is just being distorted by your own illness. There are some philosophical insights to take from being delusional, from being able to be psychotic, but for the large part, that game is all about emotional highs of psychosis and chasing them. In essence you are just after the gratification and ego-boosting elements of what your delusions tell you about your importance within the world.

176135663,I got sick in 2008 and worked unsuccessfully until 2014 so you can do it. I burned through 7 jobs though and can’t use any of them as a reference. I then went on disability or SSDI. In 2015 i got stable and I went back to school and graduated with an associates degree in 2017. Then in 2017 I started working again with my 9 month trial work period. I worked two different jobs. Then I went back to work March 17th of last year full time. So I have been at it for over a year. My SSDI stopped in June of last year. Now I have a full time job working for the government and a part time job working on airplanes. I have 36 months of extended eligibility with SSDI. If I get terminated before then I can take my termination letter to Social Security and get my SSDI back. I still have Medicare for 96 months I believe. Going back to work is doable but it really takes some time and being stable. You have to be willing to fail though. If you are not used to failure it’s a hard pill to swallow. At least it was fo

176135701,Why not investigate if you can become trained as a Mental Health Peer Support Worker? There may be a non profit organization in your area that would be willing to train you (usually for free) and then line you up for paid contract based work. We have such a program like this in the Greater Vancouver BC Canada area where I live.
176135702,Thank you _NAME_ So sweet of you. Hopefully I can afford her medication. I heard it is $60-100 a month but I don’t know for sure yet how much it is and she might need a more expensive paddock. I need to still be able to buy food etc and not cut back on that. I have $700 saved up for emergencies and that’s what I have and own. My budget will be tighter but hopefully I can afford it but may not afford to put any money aside or add more to my savings. The vet bill with blood test will cost $300. Glad I have my savings. I was so happy yesterday to be with her. I’ve missed her. I could feel her ribs sticking out cause she has lost so much weight and her winter coat is still on because of the cushings I think. But she was in good spirits I think. I know she is very old but I hope she will live a few more years. She may be the platonic love of my life and one of my happiest moments is feeling her sacred neigh.

176135708,"Look, it takes strength to admit one’s innermost thoughts. Before you plague yourself with guilt, remember your emotion is similar to animalistic behavior. It has been scientifically proven that many an animal has pain receptors, fear receptors, and nurturing behavior. Personally speaking, some years ago, reminding myself that I am no more than an animal reminded me that in nature, wild, and rustic, thinks of survival first. I am not kidding, it has helped me to act like a dog around a dog that I am well acquainted with; chirp like a bird to the best of my ability with a bird; purr like a tiger to a cat; bark I guess, maybe even to the moon. Howl like a coyote or a wolf, whichever you decide. P.S. It helps to let trusted friends and relatives know you will do this so as not to freak them out and suddenly have then think you’re possessed…trust me."

174376652,I’m happy for u mr Om. I’m also part of the clozapine club. Welcome aboard
176135721,It sounds like you’re going through some denial based on your posts. Everyone goes through the same basic phases with psychosis. First you’re in total denial and think there’s no way you’re psychotic other people just don’t understand. Some people sadly are stuck on this stage their whole lives. The next stage is you start to gain some insight. You think “maybe I do have an illness” but you still have a lot of doubt and feel like your psychosis is real. Finally you reach recovery where you are able to generally say “Yes I have an illness and I accept it.” And can recognize delusional thoughts and whatnot. You may have occasional slip ups where you start feeling like the psychosis is real again but 90% of the time you’re able to stay lucid.
176135722,"I try to reality test with my paranoia, if possible. Trouble is, I don’t always believe what people tell me."

176135730,being over 300 lbs possibly even much more than that for the rest of my life on meds with uncontrollable appetite and too tired to do anything. or deal with more symptoms and stuff off meds but be able to get healthy
176135731,I would know it’s not true. BUT. if I did believe it I would listen to people on here and take their advice and tell this to my psychiatrist and take my meds as prescribed. It sounds like a (mentally) painful delusion to carry around and delusions are hard to shake. Good luck.
176135732,"Sometimes, out of the blue, I randomly think too deeply about my illness and my life in comparison to a lot of people with high paying jobs and happy families, and I pretty much feel like a failure. Then, I realize that I don’t have to actually subscribe to someone else’s definition of what my life needs to be, or where I should be in life. I mean after all, it’s my life. I sometimes feel like we are brainwashed into thinking that happiness in life means X or Y, when in actuality we need to go within ourselves and find it. Don’t buy the hype."

176135743,"I sometimes go non-verbal when under a lot of stress. I say my feelings in a safe space. I think that sometimes I fear judgement from other people, but in reality it’s me judging me. I do things to calm down ( positive affirmations, listen to music, journal, etc.). Also, I reality check my thoughts and feelings. I’m usually my own worst enemy. My thoughts and feelings are as valid as anyone else’s thoughts and feelings."
176135744,i do believe in medicine because look at the past of the world people lived to about age 30 on average and died over small problems that common medicine fixes today

176135761,I need lots of time alone usually in bed. It feels more comfortable and safe. I am a home body too. I miss my home I had in SA and living there with partner I had n his dogs. He accepted me and was a homebody aswell. Sometimes it was difficult when his friends came over but I managed. This is how I want to live. I want to be a homebody. Less stress. I might be a empath and maybe feeling others etc . If I’m a empath which I could be then that would explain me needing to be by myself a lot. Bed is more comfortable and warm. Like a thrown or my own space. The couch is more uncomfortable and I don’t spend as much time there. Staying inside helps me. I do more activities than I used to. I’m happy with my activities. When people forse me to do things I suffer and get unwell. I became psychotic when centrelink forced me to do a housekeeping course or was that my employment agency. If I was to work i would want a private agent who I approve of and who is great in so many ways. But I’m happy being on 
the pension. Less stress and drama and helps me. Thankfully I can be at home. Best home I ever had was in SA with x but appreciate my home I have now . I have a comfortable bed to sleep and rest in.

176135787,My State is pretty bad too.
176135788,"I had a really good run for a while there, but my insomnia is back. After a week of less than 6 hours a night, I took lunesta and laid down with my eyes closed. And promptly got restless. It has now been 3 hours since I took the pill. It isn’t safe to double it up with anything else in my arsenal. Stupid brain tumor. It’s been almost half my life since it’s been gone and I still can’t sleep."
174376671,So you are familiar with your symptoms… Its schizophrenia.
176135789,I mainly miss the energy I had back then and feeling like my brain can breathe properly! I just feel a bit suffocated in the head nowadays on aps.
176135790,Photoshop is very complex ! Well done on being able to use it. Great picture.
176135791,"There is a med for putting zoo animals to sleep, call carfentanil. I don’t think it can be used on a human without causing death. Would 5 mg of Haldol or 20 mg of Zyprexa do anything…I HIGHLY doubt it. Even Thorazine. You gotta remember how large they are, that’s why carfenanil exists. Something like an 1/8 of a teaspoon will kill everybody it comes into contact. So the answer to your question is no, not even close."
176135792,"I would be very open to working with a non-profit again. I used to do payroll in a non-profit hospital and I loved it. Non-profits attract people who want to make a real difference in the world. They are often really good to work with. I used to buy my own office supplies when I worked at the hospital because they would buy the cheapest options that weren’t often the best. I bought my own adding machine, my own pens and pencils, and a few other things. I didn’t mind. We used to file timecards in empty letterhead envelope boxes because it was just as good as the ones you buy."
176135793,What side effects?
174376670,"Thank you, I called the Pdoc again, maybe it is time to find another doc. Just a reality check, how’s my insight seem? I think I’m doing okish.

176135794,I could see where that would be a problem for you. I’m an old hat at telemeds. Been doing it about 8 years now.

176135799,I was prescribed a fourth medication - citalopram (which is an SSRI I think). I’m wondering the same thing and am hesitant to take it as I don’t know if it would help with my avolition. I’m already taking a mood stabiliser and two AP’S.
176135800,"I think _AT_MENTION_ is right. If it’s drug induced psychosis, your doctor may try to taper you off meds after a while. If it’s truly sza, you’ll probably need meds for life."
176135801,Sorry to hear _AT_MENTION_ Glad you’re off now!! They have no abuse potential for me Strange how everything affects everyone a certain way. Some things I just have to say NO MORE if it’s bad for me. But other things like klonopin I can take .25 every day and never more than .75 and be fine.

174376681,"Hello. I have schizoaffective disorder but I also have these memories that came back to me. The first time they came back was when I was 18. I was on LSD in the woods and remembered the name of a musician outside whom’s concert I was calling people into. I looked him up and he was real. He had one album out on Napster. The name just came to me. “Come one come all to the (person’s name) show!” I was outside a small concert in Rockford Illinois. I’ve been there briefly and recognized the warehouse it was held in. During this time a friend of my then girlfriend would sometimes ask me “remember the ship?” and it would feel like my mind would turn to glue and I’d get this splitting headache. Yes I now remember the ship. I was abducted when I was 12 by two men who purported to sell me ecstacy. They had a big white _NAME_ and they drove me to New Jersey where they owned a warehouse where they manufactured ecstacy and taught and instructed underage abducted children how to buy and sell drug
s and steal cars. They were rapists. I ended up escaping and hopping a freight train to Illinois where we entered this army depot and ended up being found by these Amish/ Memonite German kids. I ended up meeting this musician who abused me yet I still listen to his stuff. We bought an old green buss and lived in it at an old drive in movie lot. He played a few shows I wrote two of his well known songs and I have all these vivid memories of being there. He was 23/24 and we were 13 to 16. We did stage art with fire and costumes. It was old timey jazz music. I sang once on stage at a club. The ship was before this. One of the guy’s who abducted me sometimes hopped a freighter out of my home town to Libya and came back with drugs. He claimed to have been in the special forces. He got me and a friend on board and we sailed to Libya. I remember being in what seemed like a circus tent and in the sand ring I remember it both as an out of body experience and from within. There was this tiger cub and I called it over 
and I ended up cuddling with it. In the stands were two men. An older man smoking a cigar and a younger guy standing next to him whispering to him. I remember staying at an army base for women. The woman I spent the night with was Irish and was a soldier. There was a severe electrical storm that night and she told me of how she ended up dropping out of a private school ending up on the street and ending up in Libya. I don’t know how we got home. In my home town after this I met the band Spoon when they were young and unknown. I was hanging out with this 23 year old newspaper reporter and she brought me to a house where they were hanging out. I cried into my bowl and we smoked my tears. This was when I shortly ended up in Illinois. I was psychotic after abuse and witnessing something i black out on in the warehouse. I would ramble on about things like apocolyptic rantings and alot of my words were immortalized in albums. I also slept with a female judge when I was 13. She must have been in her 40’s. I met 
_NAME_ Brown and hallucinated a battle from WWI going on outside his house. His wife was there. I had a car. A small hatchback with a screwdriver in the ignition. I did a ton of LSD and ecstacy while living in Illinois. Once when on Thorazine I became lucid and remembered who I was (I’d been going by the name _NAME_) I remembered my brother and wrote a poem that became a song. After all this I came home and ended up with amnesia. I remember my mom shaving my dreads off (I had very short dreads going on) but I just went back to my normal life at school. Had a relationship with no remembereance of these things or symtpoms. Although before this I ended up doing alot of acid in the woods of Maine. And my first girlfriends older sister and her boyfriend took me along on these crazy trips. He was a heroin addict. All these memories cme back to me in my 20’s. My parents don’t talk about it but I remember my mom asking me once in my 20’s if I remembered my 14th birthday. I had met a pilot breaking into her ba
sement. She, utterly addorable, came running down the stairs with a pistol in her hands and she “took me hostage”. She was 30 and I was just about to turn 13. She was in the airforce and flew F-15s. She was reading the bible and watching the news that night. She’d been crying. She took me up in a red bi-plane and the musician wrote a song about this. I told her I as 18 which she doubted. On my 14th birthday she took me to the base on a Sunday when her C/O was off and took me up in an F-15. I remember vividly being up there, the cannopy and the sky. It turned me inside out. I was mush on the tarmack on coming down from that. I told her my real age when she dropped me off at the bus and it broke her heart. I remember feeling the purest sadness that day. I wrote a poem extempore which became a famous song. It was my 14th birthday. I chainsmoked camel reds back then and drank red wine and peach schnapps. Anyway like I said I went back to my normal life with no memory of all this and no symptoms of anything 
other than depression during my first relationship and start of high school. It would trigger ocasionally sometimes during electrircal storms other times for other reasons. I now remember having a relationship in sophmore year of high school which I forgot about. There was also this woman I met one night at a convenience store who smoked crack with me and took me home. She was involved in the whole Furry thing. Sexual Cosplay I suppose. She wanted me to buy ecstacy for her parties and that she was afraid to buy drugs. I don’t know where she got the crack we smoked. I also when triggered out was downtown one night and ran into this beautiful red head police officer. I walked right up to her and she said all flirtaciously “i might have to arrest you” So she put me in her car and drove me to this notorious “parking” spot and she ended up putting everything she found in my pockets out on the hood of the car and said “condom, wallet, weed, knife” it was funny the way she said weed. It was a dime bag. 
She took me home to her aprtment. Her dad was some kind of politician. She slept with me during a thuderstorm and then I went home. There’s more that I hesitate to talk about. A lot more. It was after a breakup when I was 18. I went completely numb relizing that I couldn’t live easily without this person who had been all I knew. I ended up going home with someone from another state and ended up living with her. She smoked crack and had a baby. I ended up selling drugs and living with these teenage girls who took care of me. I’m not the drug selling type. I had a laywer who got me into all kinds of things including an arms deal out of Portland harbor. I drove a sports car I got a a gift. I feel like you could just discount all this and say it’s me being schizophrenic and my parents have when I’ve talked about it though it’s when I was drunk and I sensationalized it rather than starting from the beginning. They hospitalized me once for it in my late 20’s. I feel like I did all this and have talked 
to the musician at one of his concerts though I dissociated big time while doing it. They just asked me if I was _NAME_ and I said I was once. He was doing sound check and we briefly spoke. I don’t know. It’s very strange what gave me amnesia. It came in a bottle and was some kind of chemical that worked by inhaling it. I don’t know. If I could claim this as my legit life experience I feel like it would help me yet it’s really just another story I have or a lot of them. I don’t know. Tell me what you think."

Well, it’s unfortunate but the question isn’t going to get an appropriate answer because the authority of the day can’t be given to where it’s properly due and so… you can say it is ‘caused’ by sz.

174376694,"He was in prison for drink driving in the US with Schizophrenia. I was also in a young offenders institute when I was 17 when I was psychotic, and I can tell you it was awful. In the UK we have mental health prison wards where you get care. Unfortunately from what I saw on a documentary, there is no such provision in the US. I was released after a month and moved to a secure hospital and my sentence was quashed as the judge knew I was not myself. I don’t think _NAME_ got this kind of sympathy, nor many others. It seems so flawed in the American prison system. We have the same problem here with hospital beds, but they still try and do right by the patient, even if they do something wrong."

176135864,The old biker at work refuses to clean restrooms. I remember when he first got here him and the bosses had heated words about it several l times and now two years later he doesn’t have to clean them. The new guy on the crew has been here a month and two days ago I hear the bosses discussing how he said he’s not cleaning restrooms anymore. WTF? We’re friggin janitors; janitors clean restrooms! They know it; this what they signed up for when they got hired. But it sounds like he won’t have to clean them. But me and the other two disabled guys have to clean them. I was a little mad about those guys getting out of it. It is the principle of the thing. Is this job so hard to fill? It’s the easiest job I’ve ever had. I hate to be mean because I get along with these guys but is the management so desperate for workers that they couldn’t have replaced these guys when they first started? I kind of like them and I wouldn’t want them to lose their jobs now but back when they started they should 
have been forced to do restrooms or let go. And if you think that sounds harsh it’s because the ex-con and the new guy aren’t mentally ill. But me and my three other co-workers are mentally ill and we all have to clean restrooms which we aren’t fond of doing either. Is this coincidence or discimination agains’t us? It sounds like discrimination to me based on our disabilities.

174376699,"Tried to kill myself in 2nd grade by secretly taking a 50ct bottle of tylenol. I guess that’d be depression, but it started earlier cause of sexual assault at age 4 and the cops let the guy go because I didn’t show “traumatization” like a normal kid. I told in detail what happened, this was 1989. No physical check was done, I acted too ok for the officer’s liking. So my _PERSON_ took care of the guy, was threatened with jail, and that made me visibly depressed within weeks. Nothing came of it, creep didn’t press charges, but he did go on to assault 10 other young girls under age 7, last one was a cops daughter. He served time. I’ve gotten 2 stories since high school, either he finally got out. Or was killed in prison. I don’t know as I only found out years later he had been arrested in the mid 90’s. But yeah, I took OTC meds to try and kill myself a lot as a kid, then the surgery that triggered the sz. Sucky lot I tell ya. I talked to school counselors who in middle school said it 
was daddy issues and my physical pain issues, no one knew about the suicide attempts. Only my husband knows exactly what all I’ve done to myself. High school professional psychologist helped me thru the miscarriages in high school, and then the break down of my mom. He suggested me and hubby getting the hell outta Beloit, which we didn’t. My oldest caught me over the summer with deep cut Mark’s on my wrists and arms, so he knew what was going on. He’s also bipolar so he understood the situation, but he’s always had depression from young age, blame the environment the first school produced, we were outsiders and him and another boy were severe ADHD and bipolar, on meds, and they were treated like ???? by staff and the teachers would tell those 2 in middle of class, go take your crazy meds, we don’t need trouble at 10am everyday cause for them to be in school they were required to take the meds in the school office in front of secretary. It was humiliating for those two. The other boy’s family sue
d the district and won a large amount and moved to Texas with the money. We hear from them once in awhile, he’s doing so much better! And _PERSON_ is doing better here in Janesville, he’s off the ritalin and going off the zyprexa. He is much better tempered coming off. I think meds starting in kindergarten was wrong, but there was only 1 school in the town we lived in, it was K-12, so no escape."

A good place to put someone though if you want a further, specious excuse to treat them like s*** . Sports isn’t exactly the same thing but I still have memories of the ex army sergeant gym instructor at my public school . His harsh words for something I couldn’t help. Produce a civilised, non thug like, atmosphere for children’s/teenager’s participation in gymnastics/sports and that research would be of real value. Only exercise I’ve done as an adult is swimming, and that not since the place for swimming at my old address was moved from 5 minutes away from me to the outskirts of town. That was in 2010."

176135884,"You sound like you got your wits about you, there’s no doubt about that. And what you say about your neighbours sounds familiar. I too have had similar thoughts in the past, but I learned that I was over associating things to me. Getting a hard thought in my head and ruling out the possibility of chance and coincidence. And a good argument for the neighbour not mixing up into my business is that they have a life of their own and are too busy to care what their neighbours are up to, unless they play too loud music or something like that. Ask yourself what do you care about what your neighbours are up to? And chances are that most people feel the same. I would focus on learning disassociation. Whenever you hear something you think has something to do with you, you have to consider coincidence and that there are multiple reasons for a person to laugh. Maybe they are watching a sitcom on tv or are on the phone with someone or are laughing at a self made joke they made up in their head. I sometimes la

176135891,"oh yeah, what do you think about life?"
176135892,I think u could be a cia dishwasher
176135893,"i finally have friends again. it was mostly me – i had pushed everyone away. i reach out to people much more now and find it helps greatly. hugs to y’all, _NAME_"
176135894,"I had no prodrome. I went from perfectly fine to floridly ill within a week. I had had periods of mania before, so I wasn’t new to smi, but psychosis hit me like a truck, very fast and hard."

176135896,Which book?? Have you read junky by _NAME_??? I wrote flunky. It was my story version of it. It’s really good. I didn’t publish it though. One day I will write about all my crazy drug stories lol but I’m only 29 so I’m still processing them not enough to write good books on it. I have written 2 books on my life but I don’t think my mind comprehended reality enough for me to want to publish it. Hey maybe one day I’ll be famous I can publish them and say “this was my interpretation at 24-25 years old”. In comparison to my interpretation then. You know??
176135897,I’ve been on it for years. I take 100 mg. Have occasional dark days but I think they are more “normal” than going to a higher dose.
176135898,It was certainly a problem in the early 90s when my wife and I lived on Canvey island . I got lost and people had to come and find me .
176135899,Thank you _AT_MENTION_
176135900,ill pm you a good twitter pt 151515

176135903,"How old is your baby? I have a four month old. It’s hard some days. He looks at me weird when I talk out loud to myself, but I’m still a good mom. I think what get’s in the way of my parenting the most is self-doubt about my capabilities."
176135904,"No, I have no obsessions, nor compulsive behavior. Just silliness by an hebephrenic voice I have. When I hear dangerous or violent orders, I don’t comply"
176135905,_AT_MENTION_ I am very sorry to hear that. Is there a reason you can’t refill?
176135906,yea maybe you think it doesn’t affect your daily life much but maybe it does but you just don’t see it?
176135907,I wasnt able to work since I had sz. I tried many jobs but I rage quit after 1-2 weeks. I worked since I was 14y.o. before my sz at 20y.o.
176135908,"There’s nothing good about staying in the hospital IMO, especially when psychotic. You’re around people who are in their own private hells, and having a weird-ass time, trying to keep it together. Only good part is the home visit."
176135909,I hate this place How to get out asap
174376707,What positives did it help you with
176135910,"I’ve experienced exactly what you’ve described, in the past. Very frightening. This was actually was what resulted in my very first hospitalisation (I’ve only been hospitalised once two years ago). But I was freaking out; my parents were completely unrecognisable (I mean their “souls”, as you are describing) I was seeing them completely as they were in the flesh. While I’ve definitely moved on from this delusion, sometimes on very rare occasion, people that I know very well, will say and do things that seem completely uncharacteristic of them. This will also make me paranoid, as I have the feeling that I’m not with the person I really know. Like it’s “someone else” at the core, and they also change. So it becomes hard to distinguish between whether it is a simple matter of, people don’t always stick to routine things or routine ways of being. They diverge sometimes. Or whether they’ve been embodied by something else. But in all probability, the most rational answer is that t
hat former is the case. If happens all the time and starts to trouble you, definitely see your doc about it."
174376709,Huh? Okay (daze quietly ignores this)
176135911,"The most consistent voice was a running commentary. I thought it was my id. Sometimes it would be low in the background and sometimes louder. He used a lot of profanity and always was critical of what I was doing. With meds he’s quiet, although I still sometimes know what he’s thinking. I’ve also had voices that just popped into to my head and told me to behave in certain ways or command me to do things. I get some whispers in my ear and sounds outside of my head like voices coming from the electrical and phone outlets, showerheads, fans and other electronics. I also sometimes hear low background music, a group of toddles getting excited, and men outside talking but I can’t make out what they are saying. Sometimes I hear people getting out of a vehicle and slamming the car doors but no one is out there."
176135912,"Caffeine is a major issue for me too. Trying to quit, or at least cut down… I know I felt better when I was consuming less of it. It’s hard though, I understand your hesitancy to give it up. I don’t know what else to take that will energize me on the same level as caffeine."

174376705,"There are several trials on clinicaltrials.gov on sulforaphane. NCT_PHONE_NO_ is a double blind placebo controlled trial on people with schizophrenia who are on medication. The trial is supposed to end in July 2019. Hopefully they will publish their results, if they are going to do so, we might have an idea within a year or so. Both whether it’s helpful and whether there are any safety concerns with meds. NCT_PHONE_NO_ is also testing it as an add-on, but since they have been in “not yet recruiting” status since 2016, I wouldn’t count on ever seeing data from them. NCT_PHONE_NO_ is a brand new study on clinical high risk people. That is supposed to be complete at the end of 2020."
176135916,"Yes, I took one. I will take a second"
176135917,"If I forget to take one dose, I can’t sleep. If I forget to take many doses, I get psychotic again and end up back in the hospital."
176135918,"So you don’t think I need to consider if I get sick from it? I am only worried now because of what my mother said. To be honest, I have already gone from packing envelopes part time to being a data analyst in 6 years. I am not sure if this is a step too far or not. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ that means a lot"
176135919,I would be a commercial airline pilot or an offshore helicopter pilot.
176135920,Welcome to the forum!!! I suggest talking to a psychiatrist. I hope you do and get the help you need.
176135921,I’m on anti depressants blood pressure pills and I’m pre diabetic. If it wasn’t for meds tho I wouldn’t be here today… scared how it might screw with my body 20 or 30 years from now
176135922,I am 30. 666/999
176135923,You brought up nac again. _AT_MENTION_ has already told you it didn’t help him.
174376710,I have schizophrenia and lyme disease. Took Nrf2 for 2 months. Nrf2 = Protandim If you decide to take it add Nrf1 too (not tried) You will most likely get better from neuro depression. Listening to music now and feel no placebo effect but you got to be strong and patient for 2 months atleast… remember i have late stage lyme too.
176135924,"I’m going to go live with my sister at the end of the summer. I can’t wait. She’s going to help me get into shape. I have 80 pounds to lose. We’re going to go on daily walks and dance around to our favorite music at night. She’s going to buy me a fit bit type thing and I’m going to do the 10,000 step thing with her. We’re going to do a healthy eating plan together, we’re still working on exactly what that’s going to look like. But it’s been fun just talking and planning everything with her. We’re both really excited to be back together. We’re even going to go explore nature like we did when we were kids. I can’t wait. Now if I can only just get through the next couple of months of getting my husband and son off on their own way and selling everything I own without having a nervous breakdown it will be a miracle."

176135926,"Well, then this will make you feel good: I can totally relate!! _NAME_ of R.E.M. once said that he used to feel like he was different and that the things he felt were different than everybody else. But when he started songwriting he said that he learned that no matter what he felt or what he wrote about that there was someone out there who could relate. And that was good enough for him and it made him feel better."
176135927,Why do you keep asking the same question multiple times. It’s NO!
176135928,yeah me too we all here hope she is ok

176135936,"great, I guess it’s a formula anyone can use. it’s distilled from advice of my therapist and stuff from some ocd books such as _NAME_ “you are not your brain” and new harbinger’s “overcoming unwanted intrusive thoughts”"

174376712,But is schizophrenia brain damage or a bad brain from genetics? Neuroplasticity only helps brain damage and not if the brain is genetically bad.
174376714,"They’re not improving…I am starting to think that cognitive and negative symptoms are permanent brain damage. I had them on all meds, on Abilify slightly less negative symptoms but I still had negative and cognitive symptoms. I was never the same person as before my sz since getting sz.

176135943,"The counselor said neighbors had made a complaint about me. We talked it out and things are back to normal. But during the conversation I told her that you have to be a little aggressive or people will roll right over you. She acted like I said something weird. This is friggin Silicon Valley, birth of the electronic boom that in the '90s was making new millionaires every day. There is so much competition here and it is so fast paced and everybody is looking for a piece of that pie that will guarantee that they are set for life. Traffic is insane here. I want a piece of the pie too. I kinda already have it. Maybe I’m ungrateful for what I got. Work was pretty good today. I keep posting that people are nice here in the Army Reserve building. Because it’s true. When I get tired (which is all the time), it’s almost like I’m drunk and my many inhibitions seem to go away. People like me more and are friendly and I am always friendly so people treat me good. But I was cleaning the lobby today (alm
ost my most hated task) and I was talking to the security guards and I commented to him that the people are so friendly here and I was surprised. He agreed and said, yeah the people just want to be here and work and get the job done. I told him that I think the soldiers are so cool because most of them are secure and the guard totally agreed with me. Yeah, it was a good day about half the time. My supervisor came to check on me when I was doing some dusting and we got in a conversation. I think maybe he was just stressed and wanted to unwind and talk to somebody and I’m pretty mellow so he talked about his father and he talked about Vietnam (he was in the war; we’re both old coots.) and he told me a little about my co-workers and how the biker got sent home today for being inappropriately angry and how the other guys were causing trouble. We both knew I don’t cause trouble. It was just a conversation but I think I gained a little respect in his eyes because I opened up and as he walked away he said ""se
e you later’ but yeah, he said it sincerely and respectfully. It felt good to make the connection. The female boss and I get along but I think she doesn’t understand that I don’t want anything from her but just to talk normally and get along. It’s been a year now and we have normal conversations and have a few laughs but she doesn’t understand I think she’s cool and have nothing against her. It’s cool I’m sure she’ll eventually come around and join the 77nick77 fan club like everyone else. I guess I kinda grow on people after awhile, sorta like a fungus or something."

176135966,zyprexa helped my anxiety a lot
176135967,That sounds a tough situation. I’d hate to suggest legal advice because that costs money and causes drama. I’d say keeping things cool without drama is a good thing. I’m not sure of your options but others may have a bit more knowledge. It’s good your in your sons life but not sure what you could do other than keep a good relationship with your parents and work on more visitation. Show them how you’ve changed and are more responsible?
176135968,Sz is HIGHLY genetic. I know twins who both developped sz around the same time. The first thing that psychiatrists ask patients is if they have a relative with sz.

176135970,"I don’t think there’s anything wrong with asking. That’s what I’m told to do when I’m freaking out: ask. Ask if others see it, hear it, or believe it. Good job for asking! It’s what we’re supposed to do when we are freaking out and want to know if others see or hear or believe it too"
174376722,"Just because having too much dopamine may not necessarily be the cause of schizophrenia doesn’t mean that lowering it can’t help. Plus, that’s not the only thing that our meds do. If it were, then every med would work for everyone. There would be no need for variants. At least, that’s my theory."
176135971,I think I might try clozapine. But don’t know if I should try Latuda first?
176135972,Medication seems to do nothing so far
176135973,So sorry to hear that
176135974,"I used to categorically reject hate. Now I see it as a real emotion. Also, if a person looks inside, we all have some hate. So it needs to be dealt with. However, I believe that hate hurts, both the individual and others who are the object of hate. _AT_MENTION_ Do you hate me for writing? Are you critical of everyone in this way? I sense that you want to change."
176135975,Any experiences please

176135982,thanks _AT_MENTION_ I will defo consider food therapy if this last attempt on my own does not work I have tried the anonymous groups but I got too anxious in the group

176135987,"_AT_MENTION_ company/family is stressful! Good luck! _AT_MENTION_ my thoughts go out to your family. I’m glad your dad will be able to attend the dinner. I’m here at my uncle and aunt’s and my uncle seems to be in good spirits, thankfully. There’s a little drama over whether his son, who happens to be gay, will be coming to spend the night, or even attending the dinner at all. Unfortunately, with my family being the way they are, he’s basically been ostracized, but when he avoids family gatherings in order to protect himself, understandably, they just amp up the ???? talk??? He can’t win in their eyes and it’s really saddening."
176135988,very nice =D I really like it
176135989,"Hey dude. I am sorry you’re dealing with this again. Did you get on the waitlist for public housing yet? The waitlist is usually a few years long, so I suggest doing it now if you haven’t yet. _PERSON_’s rights are a thing in Canada also, and they usually offer protection for 30 days. But if you invoke them, your stepdad might take the process of a legal eviction, which will make it much harder to get a place of your own in the future. In many places, there is a freeze on evictions because of covid, so look into your local housing laws. Because you have been getting mail there for over 30 days, you have squatter’s rights. It does not matter that you have no legal contract. You have proof of residency if you have a bank account that has your address on file, a driver’s license/ID with the address, or mail dated from 30 days previously postmarked to that address."
176135990,"Hi I have schizo-affective disorder, and me and my partner are now living together. I’ve been having a bad time as of late, being extremely paranoid, depressed and tearful for no reasons, suicidal and voices and hallucinations have been causing me to be irrational. My partner has been trying his hardest to help me. But I can see how much of a toll it’s taken on him. He is getting upset with how I’m always unhappy recently and just wants to me to be happy. I don’t know how to help him or get help for him. Does anyone have any suggestions or advice for us? I really could use help for him. Thank you."

I know how anxiety is too, i even have physical symptoms from it, i cant stand on my feet by fear sometimes… Well, life isnt also about the big happiness, cause me i had my deluisons about the big happiness before… Just dont give up. Its worth it, really."
174376731,"You sound extremely delusional, my dear. My mom, my sister, and myself have schizoaffective disorder. My mom has it the worst because she doesn’t take her medication properly and doesn’t trust the doctors. She has delusions and hallucinations just like yours. She has pushed away almost all of her friends and family because the “God” in her head tells her those people are evil and will harm her. She’s extremely lonely now. She’s had this illness since her 20’s and has slowly declined and pushed away more people as she gets sicker. She’s in her 50’s now. I’m telling you this because I don’t want you to end up like my mom. She’s miserable and lonely and very sick. If you take medication now, you can knock those delusions and hallucinations out of your head and you’ll realize that your parents love you and don’t want to hurt you. Don’t push them away. You need to comply with treatment so that you can think rationally again. Right now, you are completely irrational and para
noid. I hope you take this seriously. We on the schizophrenia forum may not know you in real life, but we’re all concerned about you. Take care of yourself by accepting treatment."

176136002,"We exist to survive. That’s all life has ever done… Life is precious. While it seems there is an abundance of it… that really is just the case here on Earth. It’s of upmost importance to survive just so that life is represented in the universe. Without the universe itself would be largely point. The big empty fill with giant lifeless things colliding into each other, wholly unaware. “We are the eyes and ears of the cosmos. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” - _NAME_. Life is free form. If you want meaning than seek purpose. That purpose can be anything. Live to eat, live to sleep, live to watch the world, just live for the sake of living. Granted those are all quite basic, there are more ambitious avenues of finding fulfillment in life. I myself want the world to be a better place.

I am really hoping that the world at large has climbed to a more acceptable state before I pass. It would be most pleasing to see the story is more likely to have a good ending.

I’ve been getting that a lot and my son keeps saying ‘mum you need to go see a doctor about your memory’’. I thought at first that the memory lapses were caused by my Chemo fog/brain , I had chemotherapy 6 years ago for cancer. I also had a mini stroke where they did a brain procedure on me 2 years ago so I attributed the memory loss to that. Be interesting to see if anyone else’s memory is affected by Abilify.

176136069,"The impact of cyberbullying on emotional health and well-being Research consistently identifies the consequences of bullying for the emotional health of children and young people. Victims experience lack of acceptance in their peer groups, which results in loneliness and social isolation, low self-esteem and depression. · Stress-Related Disorders: Children who are the victims of cyberbullying are more likely to develop anxiety and depression than children who are not victims of this type of bullying. The children may become withdrawn and depressed because they feel that their life is falling apart around them. When they go to school they are face-to-face with their bullies. When they are at home or away from school, they have to worry that their bullies will taunt them through text messages, social media, email or any other way they can online. This eliminates children’s ability to forget about their bullies when they are away from school, which is a big source of anxiety. School-age cyber victi
ms indicate heightened risk of depression, of psychosomatic symptoms such as headaches, abdominal pain and sleeplessness and of behavioral difficulties including alcohol consumption. As found in studies of face-to-face bullying, cyber victims report feeling unsafe and isolated, both at school and at home. · Concentration: Cyberbullying doesn’t just affect the way a child feels on the inside; it also affects the ability to concentrate on things other than their bully. It may become impossible for the children to concentrate at school because they are constantly looking over their shoulder to ensure their bully isn’t taunting them and they may find it difficult to concentrate on homework or family life when they are afraid that their phone or computer will alert them of new bullying messages. · Emotional Issues: One of the biggest emotional issues the victims of cyberbullying experience has to do with safety. They are scared, frightened and fearful. Even their computers and phones or even an email, can ma
ke cyberbullying victims afraid. It is common for victims of cyberbullying to feel fearful at all times, whether it’s in school or at home. There is no safe haven for a child whose bully uses the Internet to haunt him/her. · Suicide: The biggest emotional concern for children who are the victims of cyberbullying is suicide. Children who are cyberbullied are anywhere from two to nine times more likely to consider suicide than other children. While these numbers may not seem very big, any additional chance that a child might turn to suicide because of bullying is very big. Bullies too are at risk. They are more likely than non-bullies to engage in a range of maladaptive and antisocial behaviors, and they are at risk of alcohol and drugs dependency; like victims, they have an increased risk of depression and suicidal ideation. Cyberbullies report a range of social and emotional difficulties, including feeling unsafe at school, perceptions of being unsupported by school staff and a high incidence of headaches. 
Like traditional bullies, they too are engaged in a range of other antisocial behaviors, conduct disorders, and alcohol and drug misuse. Technological solutions The most fundamental way of dealing with cyberbullying is to attempt to prevent it in the first place, through whole-school e-safety policies and through exposure to the wide range of informative websites that abound (e.g. UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS; http://www.education.gov.uk/ukccis), ChildLine (www.childline.org.uk). Many schools now train pupils in e-safety and ‘netiquette’ to equip them with the critical tools that they will need to understand the complexity of the digital world and become aware of its risks as well as its benefits. Techniques include blocking bullying behavior online or creating panic buttons for cyber victims to use when under threat. It was found that blocking was considered as a most helpful online action by cyber victims and a number of other studies have additionally found that deleting nasty messages 
and stopping use of the internet were effective strategies. However, recent research found that training young people in netiquette did not significantly reduce or prevent cyberbullying. Clearly there is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of technological intervention."

176136073,"This is why I hate the functioning level distinctions. So many people think I am high functioning. I sure don’t think of myself in this way. But by separating us, it makes people who get pushed in the “low functioning” box feel lile the people in the “high functioning” box are enemies, or have lives that are unattainable for them. We should all be together, looking to those who are qualified in ways we aren’t as role models. I look up to many people here. I look up to _AT_MENTION_ for being able to maintain a healthy marriage for over a decade. I look up to _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ for following their dreams across the world to countries where they don’t speak the language. I look up to _AT_MENTION_ for seeking an advanced degree. I lookup to _AT_MENTION_ for never giving up on his goal to quit smoking, no matter how many times he has tried in the past. I look up to _AT_MENTION_ for getting clean and trying to maintain employment when I know how hard those things are for her. I l
ook up to so many others on here for the things they can do that I cannot. I use them as role models to say “if they did it, so can I.” Dividing schizophrenics into distinct categories only serves to keep us on the bottom rung of society. Telling us we can’t get better and shouldn’t try doesn’t benefit anyone except those who look down on all of us. The goal shouldn’t be to either fall into the “lost cause” box or the “inspiration porn” box. We don’t exist to appeal to neurotypicals. The ones who hate us hate us equally regardles of functioning level, and the only way we get better is by banding together and trying to carry each other through the storm. We need to teach each other the pathways to success, rather than accepting the boxes other people put us into and hating everyone outside our box."

174376753,Has anyone been diagnosed with delusional disorder. I believe I have it instead of schizophrenia. What are your symptoms and treatment for the illness?
174376750,"You need medication. And maybe some talking or reading therapy. What you need to do, is use the voice of your own that is in your head (the one you read with) to think really hard. What I mean to say is. Try to do critical reading. And do it using factual topics. Eg, read a newspaper. or read a diary/journal of a biography. You need to strengthen the voice in your mind that is falling prey to ideas that are easy to align with (irrational/superstitious). Those thoughts are delusion potential pitfalls because they will build brick by brick, a taste or tendency to think without logic. As a schizophrenic risk person; you are required to be a logical as possible so that you can fight or control fear. Our fears are usually from unrealistic triggers. You have to fight that. Yes we do have fears which are plausible, but the emotion we feel. The emotion we feel, is usually disproportionate to the plausible fears. This is probably because the irrational fears (which we are very susceptible to) are sitting in 
the back of your thoughts. If you avoid illogical or superstitious territory, you will be able to ground yourself in a more “real” world. There is research that psychotic liability goes up with mathematical ability (British journal, Scandinavian study) This research makes sense. Psychotic disorder is exactly as the name suggests. It is a disalignment between a real and not real concept in the mind —- so this means, you can control it, by, in essence… not being “too creative” or like we described — not being too “magic”. All the best my man, you will make it out of the horrible confusion and painfully time consuming process of this situation or episode! Fight it!"

I’m on benztropine now which helps the akathisia. but still have to have ativan ready in case. Other side effects like drooling can be partially treated with atrovent spray.

176136182,"_PERSON_: God is above good and evil which concern only human beings. _PERSON_: described God as all good and can’t do evil. _NAME_: good and evil are imbued in mans nature. Heraclitus: everything has an opposite. Therefore, the devil (creator of evil) is the opposite of God (creator of good) and can’t do good. _PERSON_: if everything is good there is no good because you wouldn’t know what good is because you wouldn’t have anything to compare it with. If good and evil are independent then are their creators independent? Is good and evil relative? Answer: is murder for fun ok? _PERSON_: glorified God by saying that he bestowed man with such sublime capabilities as intellect and wisdom and at the same time he blamed him for not providing a sufficiently balanced mind to face problems of life. So the question remains who should we worship? Should we show sympathy to serial killers and worship them and the devil? I leave you to be the judge. Good day."
174376782,"Be glad you can afford a “doc”. Last head-doc I worked with would only diagnose healthy patients with schizophrenia for a bribe, to make them avoid criminal responsibility or conscription or whatever. Those who are actually mentally ill got written off as healthy, because they can’t pay the massive bribe. And they can’t both be diagnosed as sick because there is a limit to how many potential mental papients the government allocates. There are exceptions. And those exceptions are overworked, because the word gets around that they are exceptions and honest, and the people reach out. So one still probably doesn’t get nowhere near attention required."

174376776,"In considering whether an individual has thought disorder, patterns of their speech are closely observed. Although it is normal to exhibit some of the following during times of extreme stress (e.g. a cataclysmic event or the middle of a war) it is the degree, frequency, and the resulting functional impairment that leads to the conclusion that the person being observed has a thought disorder.[7][8] Alogia (also poverty of speech) – A poverty of speech, either in amount or content; it can occur as a negative symptom of schizophrenia.[1] Blocking – An abrupt stop in the middle of a train of thought; the individual may or may not be able to continue the idea.[9] This is a type of formal thought disorder that can be seen in schizophrenia.[1] Circumstantiality (also circumstantial thinking, or circumstantial speech) – An inability to answer a question without giving excessive, unnecessary detail.[9] This differs from tangential thinking, in that the person does eventually return to the original poi
nt. Clanging or Clang association – a severe form of flight of ideas whereby ideas are related only by similar or rhyming sounds rather than actual meaning.[9] This may be heard as excessive rhyming and/or alliteration. e.g. “Many moldy mushrooms merge out of the mildewy mud on Mondays.” “I heard the bell. Well, hell, then I fell.” It is most commonly seen in bipolar affective disorder (manic phase), although it is often observed in patients with primary psychoses, namely schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Derailment (also loose association and knight’s move thinking) – Thought and/or speech move, either spontaneously or in response to an internal stimulus (distinguishing derailment from “distractible speech,” infra), from the topic’s track onto another which is obliquely related or unrelated.[9] e.g. “The next day when I’d be going out you know, I took control, like uh, I put bleach on my hair in California.” Distractible speech – During mid speech, the subject is changed 
in response to an external stimulus. e.g. “Then I left San _NAME_ and moved to… where did you get that tie?” Echolalia – Echoing of another’s speech[9] that may only be committed once, or may be continuous in repetition. This may involve repeating only the last few words or last word of the examiner’s sentences. This can be a symptom of _PERSON_’s Syndrome. e.g. “What would you like for dinner?”, “That’s a good question. That’s a good question. That’s a good question. That’s a good question.” Evasive interaction – Attempts to express ideas and/or feelings about another individual come out as evasive or in a diluted form, e.g.: “I… er ah… you are uh… I think you have… uh-- acceptable erm… uh… hair.” “Flight of ideas” – a form of formal thought disorder marked by abrupt leaps from one topic to another, albeit with discernable links between successive ideas, perhaps governed by similarities between subjects or, in somewhat higher grades, by rhyming, puns, and 
word plays (clang associations), or innocuous environmental stimuli – e.g., the sound of birds chirping. It is most characteristic of the manic phase of bipolar illness. Illogicality – Conclusions are reached that do not follow logically (non-sequiturs or faulty inferences). e.g. “Do you think this will fit in the box?” draws a reply like “Well duh; it’s brown, isn’t it?” Incoherence (word salad) – Speech that is unintelligible because, though the individual words are real words, the manner in which they are strung together results in incoherent gibberish,[9] e.g. the question “Why do people comb their hair?” elicits a response like “Because it makes a twirl in life, my box is broken help me blue elephant. Isn’t lettuce brave? I like electrons, hello please!” Loss of goal – Failure to follow a train of thought to a natural conclusion. e.g. “Why does my computer keep crashing?”, “Well, you live in a stucco house, so the pair of scissors needs to be in another drawer.” Neol
ogisms – New word formations.[9] These may also involve elisions of two words that are similar in meaning or in sound. e.g. “I got so angry I picked up a dish and threw it at the geshinker.” Perseveration – Persistent repetition of words or ideas even when another person attempts to change the topic.[9] e.g. “It’s great to be here in _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_.” This may also involve repeatedly giving the same answer to different questions. e.g. “Is your name _NAME_?” “Yes.” “Are you in the hospital?” “Yes.” “Are you a table?” “Yes.” Perseveration can include palilalia and logoclonia, and can be an indication of organic brain disease such as Parkinson’s. Phonemic paraphasia – Mispronunciation; syllables out of sequence. e.g. “I slipped on the lice and broke my arm.” Pressure of speech – Unrelenting, rapid speech without pauses.[9] It may be difficult to interrupt the speaker, and the speaker may continue speaking even when a direct question is asked. 
Self mentions – Patient repeatedly and inappropriately refers back to self. e.g. “What’s the time?”, “It’s 7 o’clock. That’s my problem.” Semantic paraphasia – Substitution of inappropriate word. e.g. “I slipped on the coat, on the ice I mean, and broke my book.” Stilted speech – Speech characterized by the use of words or phrases that are flowery, excessive, and pompous.[9] e.g. “The attorney comported himself indecorously.” Tangentiality – Wandering from the topic and never returning to it or providing the information requested.[9] e.g. in answer to the question “Where are you from?”, a response “My dog is from England. They have good fish and chips there. Fish breathe through gills.” Word approximations – Old words used in a new and unconventional way. e.g. “His boss was a seeover.” From Wikipedia"

That’s just straight irresponsible to recommend. Also, if you haven’t already talked about it with your ObGyn, definitely do that. They will know as much, if not more, about what meds are safe during pregnancy. My perinatologist with my daughter was the one that insisted I stay on my meds. My pdoc said I should try going off of them and just living in the hospital for 9 months since I’ll inevitably go psychotic.

176136324,Well it started today. I got paid $1850 today. Usually it’s just under $1700 every two weeks. Gotta stash that cash. It’s still not clear how it will be paid back. Our union is advising us it will probably be deducted from January to April of next year. Hopefully we get a good raise.
176136325,"Thats what I am hoping, so far all he would add was vistaril. Vistaril doesnt really do anything, its like taking cough syrup. I don’t think its right for me. If I can’t get help the last resort would be to go inpatient at the psyche ward. But with the pandemic and all the stress people go through I don’t know or think they will take me and I might not be a top priority but the addiction is probably life threatening, and being that my moods are all over the place one min to the next. I think that my mental health impacts my addiction, Ive noticed that smoking weed triggered me to use other drugs. So I can’t smoke weed."

176136327,Yes I am the same way I have tried just having junk food “sometimes” or having just a little bit and not being as extreme but it inevitably leads to failure for me and binge eating unhealthy foods. For me “sometimes” or “just one cookie” is not an option. Thank you for your support
176136328,Damn that is scary. We had the worst fire season for years last year and lots of damage etc. Hoping we get a bit more rain this summer. Another would be too much.
176136329,Yes of course. Most people dont understand or believe that personalities can change. But mine did.
176136330,I’m too old now to blur the lines appearance wise. I don’t feel close to the vast majority of males. It’s like they’re a different species.
176136331,"I was very social right before I was sick and would’ve probably kept being more and more funny and popular. But I suppose life has other plans. I’m right now listening to life’s a bitcc by nas, and it reminded me of this."

I was sleeping alot and wasn’t that functional. I was depressed on anti depressants. I then did alot of research and found out about NRTs. I remember when I first bought pack of nicorettes; I popped one in my mouth and it felt like I was in the movie ‘Limitless’. I started reading again, socializing a little bit, writing stuff etc. Over the course of those 5 years, I started treating nicotine as a nootropic; taking only in moderation and a PRN if you will."

I did however win a shooting competition while my family didn’t know I was very psychotic lol. I’m a good shot. I’ve let go that part of my life, but you should look into your local laws and maybe take some classes on gun safety and storage. I know for my mom to get her concealed carry permit my mom had to get recommendations from peers, which might be hard if you have a history of psychosis."
176136339,I know the feeling. I used to spend all my time in bed and only get up for something to eat and never shower. But U got better. I cycle every day now and do stuff like crocheting and reading and I shower enough so there is hope.
176136340,We have a 3 day and night festival where I’m from and I haven’t been to it in years. I used to like going and listen to all the bands. But I can’t now. I would go into psychosis for sure. I Hope however that you can go. Because they are lots of fun when your in a good state of mind
176136341,CBT helped me a lot cause it helped me realize when I was in negative thought patterns and what caused them. So I could break the habit.

176136347,"in a recent class, subjective approach was proving this carpet has a mind, that all things really, have a mind. but, to have a mind, the carpet would need to have feelings. Any professional in the field, you tell your thoughts or ways of thinking, and they ask you, How does that make you feel. direct link between mental and feelings. so, no, I don’t think the carpet has feelings, so it doesn’t have a mind.

176136353,"I dont think anythings a stand alone factor to be honest, but i guess we all have differing major contributing factors both genetic and life related that cause a breakdown. In terms of life stress abuse for some people i think can be a major factor almost so that the scale wouldn’t have tipped had they not had that trauma…they may have stayed just below the level of a major breakdown maybe? i dunno i have a lot to learn.

176136356,Thanks for the nice quote. I think i have also gained things. F.e. I know much better whom and what i find important now. Cant always live by it. But i know. I also have much deeper conversations with people now. Got some beautiful people into my life.
176136357,How old are you _PERSON_? What used to make you tick before the illness? Sex? Games? Sports? Books? You should try that stuff again. Forget about school or work for now. Take it slowly. Also you might be on an over dose of your AP or a bad combo. Which med do you take and in what amount?
176136358,"that sounds pretty harsh. I pace my kitchen even today. Once my family committed me, but it was against my will, and not sure what went down, but the judge I supposed to see, dropped the case. Don’t know about a jury trial. Never have, but it would be hard for me to remain silent. I do have a big mouth. ha."
176136359,I kept jobs for over 2-3 years before my sz. I haven’t been able to keep a real job for more than a month after my sz diagnosis 9 years ago.
176136360,I’m really sorry to hear about your mum. Is she living on her own at the moment? You are doing a real great job looking after her I’m sure she really appreciates it a lot. Must be hard being the only sibling around _AT_MENTION_ to do so. _PERSON_ if you feel you are in the right state of mind to introduce a gf in your life why not. I hope you have places in the community where you can mingle for such things

176136374,Zoloft is activating and energizing as it increases dopamine. Its usually advised to be taken in the morning or afternoon. You can try divided dosing as well. Some people find it hard to sleep if taken at bedtime. You might feel wired like as if u have taken multiple cups of coffee.
174376852,Even if it was all from meds having positive symptoms without meds is a lot worse than severe negative symptoms. I am telling you from my experience bcz both my positive and negative symptoms are severe. Without meds I hide in my bed from fear of people while hallucinating and being suicidal and homicidal. With meds I am slightly less in bed but I have no fears or paranoia or other issues. So positive symptoms can create negative symptoms.
176136375,_PERSON_ is an extreme example but most nations have something they are ashamed of. Either in the past or the present. i.e. the U.S. with slavery and decimating the Indian population. Many other nations have oppressed their minorities and treated certain populations poorly or started wars. Only a few other nations in history have come close to committing the atrocities on a scale that _PERSON_ did.

176136401,"Paranoia is a kind of gift if used properly as it helps to think in all possible ways, a kind of creative thinking but sadly most people who have it tend to use it for the wrong purpose. To doubt people, for creating fear due to paranoid thinking etc. If used for productive purposes its great. Many geniuses have paranoia kind of thinking which helped them to solve complex problems to think out of ordinary ways. For example mathematician _NAME_, chess player _NAME_ etc. Sadly these people too had bad part in their lives where they used their paranoia to suspect people needlessly. To summarize paranoia with good insight is great but paranoia with no insight or control is debilitating."

176136418,"_AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_, just want to explain the misconception that humans evolved from monkeys. No where in evolution did it say we evolved directly from monkeys. What is says is that we evolved from a common ancestor as monkeys. So before monkeys and humans existed, there was a specie of animal, and from that specie some groups from it started branching off into different directions. For example - the group of this specie that would evolve into modern day monkeys, lived primarily in the trees. With the environmental pressures that existed for this group, it meant that their bodies had to change and adapt to that environment. For humans, way back at the beginning when they just started branching away from the common ancestor, it was because they came down from the trees and started venturing into the grasslands. This put on the specie that would evolve to become humans, different environmental pressures to that as the specie that would evolve to become monkeys. And so over time the two grou
ps grew further and further apart, so that they are what we see today."

176136421,I remember asking my doc something to that effect and she thought it was very normal in sz.
176136422,I been taking that supplement its not helping with my anxiety but its really helping with my sleep levels though i been sleeping great now im happy now.
174376858,"No, I don’t. It helped me though in some areas. I’m still treatment resistant with delusions and thought insertion sometimes. It feels like my thoughts are being triggered or inserted from dreams and past lives. It could be the caffeine. I drink so much that it negates the meds – same thing with smoking. Even normal people without mental illness would get sick, anxeity, mental health problems, and probably end up with a heart attack if they drank 10 monsters a day like I used to for months. It can be very activing for some people. For some it didn’t work. but for my body chemistry it did wonders. I am staying out of the hospital almost permanently. Two days ago I had severe flairup but recovered without help. I just needed to sleep. I still have lack of motivation, but my moods are stable, less depression, and more energy to do things. I think for me it was less activing than some meds like Invega. Caffeine increases my restlessness with Vraylar. If I didn’t abuse caffeine, I might be 2x 
higher functioning and have more motivation and drive. I have no activities. I believe I have impairment in executive functioning. It helps I had an above average IQ before the illness, although I had and have no real skills or work experience. I wish I would have been a computer science major then I could make money programming. I really don’t have enough skills to work yet. Might take 5+ more years if I coded every day to get an entry level job. I’m just not that good anymore at retaining information, being consistent, and working hard and ethics."

Does that mean I was schizophrenic on psychotic?? Doctor said I was psychotic but I haven’t asked him if I was borderline schizo or on watch or anything like that"
176136435,"I find the paranoia is particualry worst in times of added stress and the more time I have to spend around people. Yes, the letter from the review I got mentions social anxiety. I mean at one point it was so bad I was housebound so when he suggested work from home if it gets too bad, I was like I don’t want to go there. I have been watching videos. I saw the one you posted but also have been watching ones by _NAME_. Also social anxiety was actually my first diagnosis many years ago before I had the psychosis. Seems like it was always valid."
176136436,"Ah alright, dont have issue down there on Olanzapine but the blood work was bad so doc decide to give me Abilify. The time when i had dysfunction i was on Invega, my doc is a lady and i told her my problem and immediately put me back on Olanzapine 4 years ago.

174376854,"Hi guys. If you look at the length of this post and feel waste of time to read, you can read straight from the middle part (below the - - - - - - - sign), otherwise you are free to go. But before you go, I really want to shortly give you a point of view for the life that I feel it is really right for me, so don’t be same like me: Guys, in your life, you should try to be in a good manner, if you don’t, God will know and will force you to suffer some things, soon or later. Some people call it Karma and I m not sure is this the right words (English is not my native). But guys, I believe in this, and I totally deserve this current situation. So guys, don’t be like me, try to be good in your life. You will get happy and lucky sooner or later, if the result not happen at your current life, if can happen at a time…not in your current life, but it WILL happen. Now you (who don’t have time) are free to go. And thank you for your times. Hi guys, thank for the rest staying with me. I been bad manner 
in my young ages and now I have to suffer this horrible situation, I will tell you why that I believe there are something that we can not explain, but I believe it is exist for fews very CLEARLY evidences. I don’t know what the right word to call it. God, Spirituality, Ghost, Esoteric or… I don’t know. But it will be another post. This post is only for me to ask for a way out of my situation, hopefully in a modern science aspect like psychology or biology… Well… I m possibly one of the poorest guy on earth. I suffer from Schizophrenia about 10 years ago, possibly biggest reason is from about 4 years of drug abuse. For that period, I heavy used cannabis (whole 4 years), and also heavily MDMA in some of last months of this period. I believe stucked in drug abuse is also a way God force me to suffer for reason that I been bad manner at my young ages. I m so unlucky that I living alone in the whole period. ( Imagine when you get addicted and you living alone… well, nothing worst) So no one could help 
me out the situation. But little lucky, that dark period have an incident to stop, because my parents finally find out the situation. (A day that I get paranoid to such an degree that I really feel a lot of people are secretly spying me, and someone gonna kill me. I even broke the window of a poor household, trying to call police to help. When they come and found out I paranoided, they send me the mental health, and then my parents know it since that days) Now is the main part, sorry for long writing (but I really want to share my story) My current state is horrible. But I consider it mostly belong to the Negative Syndrome of Schizophrenia. ( I don’t have any Positive Syndrome anymore long time ago). The biggest problem is the way I talk (It called by the term “Alogia” in Negative syndrome) The voice when I speak out is very very unstable. I try to visualize my situation by that drawing. The sentence “That guy was great” is an example of my speak. Screen Shot 2019-11-16 at 2.07.54 AM.jpg 1406×946 4
44 KB When I m in public situation, or when I feel there are peoples stand close enough to hear what I will say…(STATE B), I will speak with a very very shaking, trembling, nervous voice. I don’t need to describe more since I believe you all can understand what situation I mean. But recently, I realize something that I consider is the “light at the back of the tunnel” for my life. This is the thing I found: Everytime I feel I m in a condition that I consider safe, easy, calm…. for example inside my family (talk with my parent, or my brother, my sister…), my voice suddenly stable in a surprising way for me. Ofcourse it is not as good as average people (since the damage of the drugs, the damage of Schizophrenia to my brain) but to get up to this much of stable is way too lucky for me. Also another way I can achieve this stable is to drink a little bit alcohol few minutes before. Then, WOW, achieve reasonable stable again. I ask my self why the hell I don’t I realize this sooner. It mean that my br
ain is not damaged too much, damaged to such as degree that I can NEVER speak in a STABLE way. No, it is not. I CAN speak in a stable way. But… Well. Now is mr BUT. But I can only achieve that stable voice once I meet 1 in 2 condition above. (STATE C) Well. That is hard. I think I would need some magic way to TRICK my mind that the social situation is safe, is calm… like my prefer situation (STATE C) Another visualize I try to draw to describle my ideas to respond any question, any communication circumstance. But I don’t need to describe more since I believe you guys can all understand once you look at the draw. Screen Shot 2019-11-19 at 2.44.19 AM.jpg 1978×1330 775 KB Very similar to the previous problem. When social situation, I feel mostly nervous so my brain can not concentrate to think to many ideas. But when I m in comfortable situation, seen like my brain can able to works, so I just producing ideas like normal healthy people (not as much as them and as good as them, but the result is far more b
etter than I m in nervous situation.) That is all purposes of my post. What I need now simply is a way to trick the mind, or a medicine to help my brain working like it is in a favor situation. Is this hard? Or is this a method that current medicine science haven’t got any solution? Guys, please give me some thoughts. Thank you a lot for spending time hearing my story."

176136470,"Many people with rituals have to do them in a certain order with a certain amount of time between rituals. They have to do them “perfectly.” The first thing you may want to try is response interruption, a way of slowing things down between doing the rituals. You want to give your brain some time to think about what you’re doing. For example, go ahead and do the first ritual, then you MUST wait 15 minutes before you do the second ritual. Continue to do this (wait 15 minutes between rituals) as you do the rest of the rituals. You may also want to add changing the chronological order in which you do the rituals. For example, do the first ritual, second ritual, fourth ritual, third ritual, etc. I hope this helps."
176136471,"hi _AT_MENTION_ Personally, I think you’re in paranoia right now. I may be wrong but that’s my practical opinion. I live in a prosperous, western society where things are pretty stable & good for me right now. Yes, I have SZ and BPD and that sucks and messes with my perception at any given moment. But my logical mind tells me that I’m safe and stable. My mind is not stable, my emotions are not but society is. Half my country is on fire right now. Bushfires, climate change…Emergency & military services are doing what they can to help people, live stock & wild life. Down south, the air in my house smells of burnt tragedy & death not because of my sz but because of the reality that half the country is burning due to bushfire brought on by human-induced climate change. I choose to only watch the news if it motivates me to take effective action - that action may be I donate $2 to an emergency fundraising fund, maybe I lobby a local MP for action on climate change, maybe I water my plants that ar
e locally endangered species that will be planted in a conservation, habitat reserve come autumn. I’m safe in the knowledge that I’m thinking globally (global environmental disasters), acting locally. I can only suggest that you act locally and effectively. I have SZ and BPD, it doesn’t stop me for a moment in being effective."
176136472,"In another forum, when I see that posters are tearing down an easy target I’ll want to send a deliberately restrained response that tries to sound reasonable.

Then, in probably the next topic, I may post mischievous banter while everyone is in deep discussion. And I only realize it after it’s done, not before I do it. Why I’m like this is that I probably don’t know how to act in a real situation. Is this relatable? This is an ordinary example just to illustrate, my choice of appearance and how I behave often follows this policy if it doesn’t conflict with my fears. One day in my dreams a president will give me a bravery medal."

Maybe try avoiding putting the tattoo underwater, via wrapping it for a shower, and see if that helps it from getting too dry. You still want to wash it, but I use a cloth, soap, quick rinse, and pat it dry after. Some people can wash a tattoo off in a shower a week after getting it, but that is not me.

176136566,I think it is very admirable that a student psychiatrist would want to find ways of helping the patient. by getting a deeper understanding of how they experience things and so can think up what ways they may be able to help. shows they really care about doing their job well

176136569,Took me 7 years to find the right combo. I am now stable. Before that I was very bad off. I got sick in 2008 and I started my current med regimen with Geodon and Latuda in 2015. Since I have been stable I have gone back to school and gotten a 3rd college degree and now I have gone back to work. I wish I were a lot better mind you but being stable is nice. There is hope.

I was in college before this and I had a job. I had everything going for myself and now it’s like I have to start over. I don’t really have a choice unless I want to stay this way forever, which I don’t. My family don’t really understand my illness but being on this forum is helping me so I’ll focus on that.

176136585,"Here’s an interesting sort of test: do phrases like “don’t count your chickens before they hatch” confuse you?

So I watered her pretty good and I’m keeping a better eye on her. The bonsai however seems very happy. I have lots of new growth to decide what to do with. So far I’ve left it alone. Just seeing what it does. Honestly with me being a new bonsai owner I’m a little nervous about making any cuts. But I am starting to see where it needs to be shaped and a little needs to come off. Maybe I’ll get a second opinion from my son. He knows a lot about plants and he could give me a little confidence.
176136599,"I’m bringing this all up in therapy tomorrow but I’ve been really struggling with my ptsd lately and the events that lead up to it. It’s a complex situation I have a bit of everything in the past, sexual abuse when I was 12 with a friends uncle, at 14 I was raped by two older boys one was my friend and the other was a friend of his, and then at 15 I went through a year of institution abuse at a WWASP program that really messed me up. I’ve begun to process all this in therapy and things have been getting worse honestly, but something that’s really started to bother me is one other incident that happened just two years ago when I moved to New Jersey. I’ve been battling with this recently as some repressed memories have come back up and I’m really not sure how to cope with this. So here’s the situation and it’s sort of graphic so if you’re an abuse or rape survivor just take caution I guess when you read this. I had met this guy online, we seemed to hit it off quite well. I was lon
ely in New Jersey and didn’t have any friends outside of the place I worked. I agreed to meet him at a local park one Sunday afternoon. I didn’t know where this park was but I thought it was a good public area. I arrived and met him at the park bench near the baseball diamond. We seemed to hit it off alright at first, he was into wrestling and worked part time for an auto parts company if I remember correctly. We talked for the good part of an hour then he asked me if I wanted to go for a drive to a scenic area that was near by. I agreed to go. So we left my car and took off in his car. He took me to a deserted dirt road and eventually pulled off in a secluded parking area. There were no other cars around. He asked if I wanted to get into the back seat with him, and I laughed it off not thinking he was serious. But he was. So he got more insistent. Not wanting to get him mad I agreed and got into the back seat and he joined me. He started kissing me on my lips and then my neck. I told him to wait and that 
I just wanted to take things slow. He replied that he was taking things slow and that I needed to relax more. He kept kissing me and then his hands started to wander and I just froze. I remember thinking that this can’t be happening again. He took off my underwear from under my skirt I told him to wait, again saying I wanted to slow down. But he didn’t listen, I wanted to cry but I just felt numb like no emotion would come out. He took his pants down and I said Look I don’t want to. But he cut me off and just abruptly told me that we had already gotten this far and he wasn’t going to stop now, and he penetrated me. My thoughts raced, I knew this couldn’t be happening, and I also knew he didn’t have a condom on. He asked me if I was on birth control. Yes but I don’t want… I didn’t finish my sentence. He just replied good and kept going. My whole body was tense and the pain from the penetration was horrible but I didn’t show any emotion on my face. He just kept going and occasionally kissing 
my neck. I finally got the courage to speak up and told him that I didn’t want him to come inside of me. He just kept going and told me that it would make a mess otherwise. He kept on for another minute or so before climaxing and coming inside of me and then collapsing on top of me. He put on his pants and he just smiled at me. I felt like I couldn’t move but I also knew the faster I put on my underwear and got back in that front seat the faster he could drive me back to my car and I could go home. So I did and got into the front seat. He got in the drivers seat and started to head back and turned to me and told me something very explicit that made me very uncomfortable. When we got back to the park where my car was parked I got out of the car without saying anything and hurriedly walked to my car. He called after me that he would see me again next Sunday. I got into my car and drove back to the farm, when I got back I didn’t speak to anyone I just went straight upstairs and got into the shower. It was 
scalding hot but I felt like I had to wash HIM off of me. I scrubbed every inch of my body. When I went into my room I just sat on my bed. I never said the word NO I thought, I never said the word STOP. He had every right to assume that I wanted to have sex with him, I mean I willingly got into the back seat with him. This wasn’t rape. Not like before. It couldn’t have been. I didn’t sleep much that night, the events just rolled in my mind over and over again but I just kept telling myself that it was my fault for not saying NO or STOP. And that I had to not let it effect me. The next week I went and saw him again, we went to that same secluded spot and I knew it was going to happen again but instead this time I FORCED myself to think I wanted it. I even participated a little more, I still asked him not to come inside of me and again he didn’t oblige, but I told myself not to worry because I was on birth control. To this day i’ve never cried over what happened until tonight the memories came rushing 
back of that day and that extreme guilt and shame came back. I’m trying to figure out if it was really rape when I never said NO or STOP, and would it still be rape if I willingly went back the next week. I feel really screwed up and just plain sick to my stomach. Consent is just a weird thing that I’ve always had a skewed perception of ever since I was 12. I just don’t know what to think."

174376902,"Ya, the whole “why me???” crosses my mind all the time. Like why do I deserve this ????. Nobody deserves this ???? not even my worst enemy!!! I come up with excuses that it’s man-made and was given to me on purpose. I often think I’m the 1 in a billion that got it from the Montauk Project and time travel and even aliens. Luckily, it has improved 10-fold or even 100-fold over the years. I still have a lot to go on improving myself… I honestly believe if they can invent time travel (which I’m sure exists already) they can definitely cure schizophrenia or even send the cure back in time. It’s not hard to understand this."

174376889,"First of all,a distinction must be made between the actual reality of sz condition and the data of the theoretical hypothesis In reality,the sz causes a malicious falsification of the self-convictions inits which is known by the term ""cognitive deficiency "" or "" cognitive impairment "" or delusional beliefs While the theoretical hypothesis on contrary,it is assumed that the cognitive impairment causes the sz condition and its symptoms !! During the effect of the psychotic factor ( functional cause of sz) on the mental side; The basic purpose is to change and modify the self-convictions that associated with the mental concept of any idea that was mentally treated and understood in the present time Therefore the bilateral interaction occurs between the psychotic factor and the data of self-knowledge which be used by the person to understand the reality of any inputs / influence Regardless the degree of right /wrong in the concept of self-knowledge units ,the pathogen has seeks to modifies the self

176136632,"there’s a debate within psychiatry as to whether stopping anti psychotics can cause psychosis due to the withdrawal from the drug alone, and not because of the underlying illness. do you think the withdrawal alone can cause psychosis? why or why not? for me, i’ve tried getting off meds, because i think for a lot of people who dont show many symptoms on meds, there’s only one way to tell if you could stop, and that’s by stopping. but whenever i do it, i relapse. if it’s not the disease causing the symptoms, though, how can i truly tell if i need to stay medicated? seems like the only way to know if you dont have a lot of symptoms on the drugs, is to just stop and solider through being not medicated for awhile. not that i recommend anyone do this, but. thoughts?"

176136675,"They keep saying; I knew. Referring to someone I dated 3 years ago, who lied about me. I would have never gone out with him if “I knew”. He never said anything about what he lied about. If I was that desperate I could have found someone with money. People just like lying about people."

176136677,"_AT_MENTION_. Do you let your pdoc know when you’re having these kinds of thoughts? If you’re experiencing an increase in feelings of suspicion or paranoia, you should let your pdoc know."

I have complex post traumatic stress disorder which precipitated me in developing schizophrenia. In saying that, I think most of the posts I’ve read so far I could relate too. Thought broadcasting, _NAME_ show, aliens, dragons(my fav), depopulation, gang stuff, creation myths (second fav). I actually don’t mind my visions, as long as I maintain my reality simultaneously. It’s pretty cool travelling as hydrogen meeting plutonium. I loved hearing how dragons want balance for mother earth and how they speak to her. The list goes on, its this huge story that’s never ending and always expending."
176136682,Thats super ?????? up.
176136683,Here in America things are getting a little better in that the youth are very educated about mental illness. There’s still a lot of people who aren’t very educated and ascribe it to something like demonic possession though.

176136705,ah yea that sucks =( can’t you push the thoughts away with other thoughts?
176136706,I’m not going to do it. I just wish that people knew and understood. I often find myself coming away from interactions with strangers thinking it went one way and then slowly realizing it was probably the opposite. And how the things I said or did may have contributed to that.
176136707,"Haldol, 0.9mg. I still wish to get off meds. I hate how other people decided i should use medication, without ever giving me a chance to recover. They didnt even try to heal me instead of drug me."

It’s only the in last 23 months with the combination of my stepdaughter’s help and support , and being under a better mental health trust , that things have improved ."
176136708,"Not sure about the trade-off though. As I see it I was never truly delusional in the first place, only intellectually playful. Also my cognition has slowed down somewhat.

176136715,"How to prevent this? There is no way of growing brain tissue back… From https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_schizophrenia: ""The grey matter in the cerebral cortex of the brain shrinks over time in people with schizophrenia; the question of whether antipsychotic medication exacerbates or causes this has been controversial.

176136721,I’m doing fine. I see the doctor tomorrow.
176136722,Seroquel should cause less weight gain than Zyprexa according to Wikipedia. Also do what LED said. Remember Calories= calories intake (-) calories expenditure. Use a calories counter app on your cellphone.
176136723,"Me too. I used to write scripts for ordering pizza. Now I just do it on apps like DoorDash or Uber Eats. It’s nice to have. Funny thing is, I’m almost completely fine if people call me first or if I’ve spoken to them on the phone in the past."

This thing is light and can just be lent against something when not in use. It is made of a very light flimsy dowel wrapped in reusable wipe secured with masking tape. It would block the insects about 80% good enough. Image_20238947294048×3036 3.22 MB

The guy had spent the whole night with this girl in his bed, and he’d had sex with her several times. I was in a bed next to them. Then he forced the girl to have sex with him one more time, even though she was protesting that she didn’t want to. I told my pdoc about it one time in therapy, and he wouldn’t say it was a rape. He said that people take things like that into account before they sleep together. I almost said to him, “Oh, so is that why they say one girl in every four is raped at college?” I had a feeling he would have hurt me if I said that, though. So I let him say it unchallenged."

We have a different system over here and it’s ok. I get my medical free mostly and scripts are cheap… We have a pretty good system here at the moment. I can survive with dad’s help and still have some disposable income. It’s only good to have spare time and income to use it. It’s amazing how much it costs you leaving the house for food, gas etc. Mate. I’d suggest working a bit more if your fit and doing it easy. Keep that fitness up unless you have a plan!"

174376939,I’m impressed by discourse features to be honest. It seems the technology is the best thought out forum software in the history of forums. Now I know why it’s expensive to run discourse. Definitely worth it though. This forum wouldn’t be the same without this incredible technology. The next best forums I ever used was espn forums before they shut them down. Omg those forums were so awesome. Too bad I was probably schizophrenic given I HAD to troll in every post that I made. It was delusional imo to do that. I started to calm down at 18 years old before quitting my internet identity at 19. Before coming back and telling everyone my real identity. Which resulted in a lot of scrutiny and hate. But those espn forums…were intelligently made as well. Just messed me up for a while.

174376968,…Tv doesn’t talk to normal people. Thus the problem here. I used to get messages off of horoscopes. That really is such negative stuff. It doesn’t make it anymore real but just enforces the delusional process on your brain. Sorry your struggling matey but you know what is what. Positive symptoms are seductive. They really are because your brain is telling you to experience something as real that no one else sees. That is the problem.

174376972,"# Exploring the mRNA expression level of RELN in peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients before and after antipsychotic treatment Background: The Reelin (RELN) gene encodes the protein reelin, which is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a key role in brain development. Additionally, this protein may be involved in memory formation, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity, which have been shown to be disrupted in schizophrenia (SCZ). A decreasing trend in the expression of RELN mRNA in the brain and peripheral blood of SCZ patients has been observed. There is a need to determine whether changes in RELN mRNA expression in SCZ patients are the result of long-term antipsychotic treatment rather than the etiological characteristics of schizophrenia. The expression levels of RELN mRNA in the peripheral blood of 48 healthy controls and 30 SCZ patients before and after 12-weeks of treatment were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: The expression levels of RELN mRNA i
n the SCZ group were significantly lower than that of healthy controls; however, after 12-weeks of antipsychotic treatment, RELN mRNA levels were significantly increased in the SCZ group. Conclusion: The up-regulation of RELN mRNA expression was current in SCZ patients after antipsychotic treatment, suggesting that the changes in RELN mRNA expression were related to the effect of the antipsychotic treatment. Keywords: Antipsychotic treatment; RELN; SCZ."

176136875,"I just want people to be happy with themselves and want to take care of themselves. I see that as something that people with mental illnesses struggle with. Don’t give up on taking care of yourself mentally and physically. It’s easy to compare yourself to others. But you can’t do that, or you will always think you are no good. To be honest. Everyone in the universe has their own problems, their own story. What seems easy to us, might be difficult for them and visa versa."

176136882,"I like _NAME_’s view on IQ. But I can tell you are gifted and you seem to have a mental illness, which is not the end of the world if treated properly. Some people have really high IQs and can do amazing things. You can tell like that one math professor from UCLA named _NAME_ I think. Boy genius in math. Could probably solve / do anything. We are just normies though."
174376976,"My parents never told me “you have to do this. You have to do that”. I was more so told you will do this. You will do that. Meanwhile my co workers would tell me “you will be in control of (your dads company) one day” That really went to my head. Someone already facing mental illness. I later told that co worker I was Sz and he actually was understanding and felt really bad and always gave me a hug after that. He was just joking around I understand now. But then he felt remorse me being Sz and all. Because _PERSON_ ran in my dads family and he definitely saw my cousin devastated by the illness and he didn’t think I was bad for it so he was real nice after that. But my parents never put pressure on me growing up. But my mind was so messed up by the time I was 18 that when I first figured out my dad was in control of a company when I was 19. (Before that I really didn’t understand, just knew my dad was successful). But I was really in denial about my schizo at this point everyone was aski
ng me what I wanted to be. I would say a writer. Because I thought I was good at writing. But I really think my Sz ?????? me over. Hey i gotta regroup and I wanna get a job at the elderly center in a cafeteria through rehabilitation services. I’m only 30 years old and I’ve pretty much overcame schizoaffective on meds. I still can write. I still can work. I get disability and my parents help me too. Which is good for now. Ultimately I wanna be independent but I’m grateful for my parents right now. I just think it’s an unfortunate experience that I became so delusional. I was delusional BEFORE I ever thought about money. But thinking I was gonna be rich made things a million times worse. My parents were ALWAYS planning on selling their company. I had no chance to be the boss. But my schizo wanted to believe it’s true. Oh well. I’m more humble than ever because of these experiences and I can only move forward from here. Just felt like sharing tho."
176136883,Been doing so well since May and then last night started to feel like depression coming back. Today felt like a swimmer trying to keep my head above water and now this evening feel all mixed up like I’m excited and down at the same time. Feel like dancing and running and feel grey at same time. I’ve had occasional paranoia and voices over these last few months but no mood symptoms. But now they seem to be returning. I don’t know why. Maybe because two weeks ago reduced my Lamotrigine to 100mg from 150mg. If it’s that it’s only affected me now. Going to go back up to 150mg and hope that helps!

I solved the nausea by taking it at bed time."
174376975,"Trouble is going off meds may not make them more effective when you get back on them.

Every last person on here has suffered because 
of schizophrenia so we can relate to each other. And we don’t talk exclusively about problems or negative stuff.

I believe that a higher power can change things in an instant if He/ She desires, independent of our work. However, this is not his design. I perceive that he wants us all to work.

176136922,"I just don’t know if proud is the right word or the right phrasing? When I was about 19 or so, I was trying to study physics. I learned about how things are made of atoms and the atoms are always moving. I believed this explained why everything around me was always vibrating, moving. I believed I could see the atoms in everything, because everything: tables, walls, the ground, everything I looked at was in motion. I often still see stationary things as in motion, and I still perceive very bright, brilliant colors. I’ve seen angels and demons, and then just things running towards me, across my path, etc., especially insects… I’m not proud of these experiences, but I don’t hate them. I am proud of maintaining even at far below average functioning, through it all. Sz has stolen so much from me, but it never defeated me, not yet. I’m proud of that."

AP’s and opioids as well as opiates enhance the drowsy feeling of AP’s and are potentially very dangerous.especially if youre on a high dose of, let’s says zyprexa or similar. That said - im not proud to admit - ive mixed opiates and a low dose of abilify with a prescription opiate, it didn’t help with the pain, and for a period i was an addict… but im still alive and now free from opiates"

Sexual problems, weight gain (Inc. Diabetes), movement problems. If you research the common side effects of all available, you will have to make a decision as to what you prefer. I chose Amisulpride because I find the weight gain problematic, and I was on Haldol and the movement problems were too much for me.

176136950,"Hello my name is _NAME_ and I am sending an SOS out on the internet forums. I seem to have amnesia and have forgotten much of my life. I’m currently trapped in a deserted city in the middle of Americas. The internet connection is limited and only works during the mornings with limited access to many pages. I’ve been trapped in this city for the past week and i’ve provisioned enough food and water to survive but i’m afraid. At night the city turns into a different world, when the sun sets these “things” come out of the shadows and materialize as horrors from the unknown. I can only describe them as demons from hell. I can fight them off sometimes, the smaller ones, but the bigger ones cause me to run and hide. I was left a URL from a torn up book I found in the shop across the street. It gave a very cryptic message that I need to find out who I am and I will be able to leave the city. However, during the day, the door to my apartment seems to lock itself and I am unable to leave until th
e sun starts to set and those things walk the streets. The electricity works somewhat, but the darker areas I dare not tread."

He has bipolar yet is extremely gifted and high functioning and there’s little down side, while I’m severely schizophrenic. I rather be in his place or spot though sometimes. I also think he’s paranoid and a narcissistic when he gets angry and jealous. I wouldnt want to be in his crosshairs… But I would do anything for a cure. Im sure hes a swell guy."

174376995,"What I can say is that since I decreased my aripiprazole dose from 15 mg to 5 mg, my negative symptoms simply went away. But it’s very important to understand that I don’t have positive symptoms since my first hospitalization in 2015. And it’s also very important to do any management of medicines with the help of a psychiatrist. No way that stopping medicines by yourself is a good idea. _USER_ID_: memantine also helped me with negative symptoms, but the whole stuff went away just when I decreased the dose of aripiprazole."

For me, I went the smart option but dropped out due to switching majors and getting schizophrenia. College was super affordable for me. That was back in 2007-2011. It still is. In fact, I got paid to go to school. I even have a better shot now since I’m over 23/24 and make $0 in income and am independent. Personally, I would have joined the military instead of staying at a dead end job and complaining I couldn’t afford college. I’m not an agent of change or an activist.

It’s a mushroom extract and it seems to multiply the effectiveness of my Geodon without ramping up side-effects. I went from 80mg/day to 10mg/day and am mostly free of positive symptoms now unless I’m stressed over something. I still have the negatives, but have learned to work around them. CBT is your friend.

176137046,"I’ve had a few episodes when my dose has been too low, but got better soon after increasing dose. I was trying out 2.5mg olanzapine and I think I was in limbo between coping and having a episode. I also had a minor episode after experimenting with high dose of Bacopa Monniera which increases serotonin activity in the brain. I was doing 400mg bacopa which is a high dose. The idea was to counter the meds(olanzapine) oversedating my serotonin activity, but 400mg bacopa was overdoing it. Now I’m only doing 50mg bacopa each morning which I feel gives a little counter effect to the heavy serotonin inhibition. I like to take it in the morning, while I take meds at evening as to minimize possible interactions."

176137061,"It is not the end of coincidences with “giant egg”. There are more. My serie of coincidences lasts pretty long, above 4 years and 6 months . How common are so long series? For me the most probably reason of it appears to be some sort of supernatural phenomenon . There is also mathematical chance that all my coincidences are “mere results of mathematical chance”, but probability of such a cause of my coincidences appears to be very small, only theoretical because of obvious multiciplity of “coincidences”. I may have thoughts that I in fact will be a man who changes the world to make it much better and my numerous “coincidences” are beautiful, epic miracles from Almighty, not ideas of reference or delusions (of reference, grandiosity, messengership). I have also suspicion that they are from devil. Coincidences were associated for example with sports, programs about “space aliens”, games containing many immoral contents, book at which Christians can look as “satan’s handiwork
. Difference between sum of digits in triplet 7, 29, 139 and sum of digits in triplet 5, 23, 421 is 14 ( 31-17 ); it is interesting number, because it is arithmetic mean of “most coincident” numbers 21 and 7, product of three digits forming 21 and 7 together and difference between larger and smaller number of double 21 7; from digits of numbers 31 and 17 two arithmetic sequences with sum of digits 12, 4 digits, sum of numbers 21, arithmetic mean of numbers 7 and product of digits 21 can be formed: 1, 7, 13 and 3, 7, 1 1, both sequences are formed by additive non-composite numbers. Difference between sums of repeating digits in both triplets is 14 (9+9=18 - for 7, 29, 139; 2+2=4 - for 5, 23, 421), the same as difference between sums of digits in them. From sums of sums of digits in sums of digits forming these sequences (7, 11, 13 - 7, 2, 4 - sum 13 ; 5, 5, 7 - 5, 5, 7 - sum 17 ) together two arithmetic sequences with sum of digits 12, 4 digits, sum of numbers 21, arithmetic mean of numbers 7 and product 
of digits 21 can be formed: 1, 7, 13 and 3, 7, 11, both sequences are formed by additive non-composite numbers. First two numbers forming triplet 5, 23, 421 are Thabit numbers (321 numbers) which have additive prime being also 321 number as sum of digits - 5 . Sum of digits from the left side in the logo with “giant egg” triplet is 10, the same, as sum of digits in double 21 and 7. Sum of numbers 5 and 23 is 28 - just like in the case of 21 7. Smaller number from the double 5 and 23 is one-digit and larger is two-digit, just like in the case of 21 and 7. First digit in larger of numbers from double 5 and 23 is 2, like in the case of very coincident double 21 and 7. Sum of digits in the largest of numbers of triplet 5, 23, 421 is 7 and from that number numbers 42 and 21 can be separated, double 4 21 also can be separated by entering space between 4 and 2, product of 4 and 21 is 84 - so number 421 and triplet which it contains are coincident with something which I named “miraculous geometrical sequence” 
- 21, 42, 84 (and its descending counterpart - 84, 42, 21 ). Sort of digits occurring in triplet 5, 23, 421 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . These digits form five-membered arithmetic sequence; that triplet contains 5 the same digits as another triplet which was strongly coincident for me - 33, 42, 51 (it is also triplet which has six digits , like “giant egg”."

176137089,I’ve been on it since 1997. Yes it does work but don’t expect results over night. It took me 5 years to recover from psychosis. Progress was slow but steady. The reason I stuck with it was because it had less side effects then haldol. I also tried other drugs but didn’t like the effects of them. I drink a ton of coffee to fight the sedation. I take it at night but the early part of my day is a slog. Unless you’re on a mega dose I don’t think it’s going to work fast. I’m only on 10 mgs but I’ve heard of people taking 40 mgs. For 20 years I’ve taken it every night. I might skip a dose once or twice a month.

And i still do loads of things - repetitively moving my fingers and hands, playing with a pen, walking on my toes, covering my ears and rocking. Catatonia and pacing, in more severe cases. It is not constant, just when im very emotional/stressed. I kind of wondered how common this is for a non-autistic person? Does anybody have such things? I am ashamed of it, it feels like something that fits a 4 year old with classical autism, not an adult with no such diagnosis. It is mostly sort of controllable, unless i am too overwhelmed, then it isnt. My psych doesnt know, because i felt stupid about it."

174377035,"If you are looking for a natural supplement for managing negative symptoms like depression, needless anxiety, low mood, low motivation, OCD like behavior, phobia etc and also for improving energy, libido, reducing day time sleepiness etc then DMG or Dimethylglycine is the answer. Its a methyl donor like TMG or Trimethylglycine, methyl folate etc. It give effects similar to TMG, methylfolate etc but what makes DMG best is it have several added benefits. TMG can affect blood cholesterol levels while DMG reduces blood cholesterol level. Methylfolate can’t be taken daily as it increases blood folate levels and thus might affect vitamin b12 level. Thus DMG is best among three. It reduces depression, anxiety etc by improving the cognition like working memory, attention etc unlike antidepressants and other drugs which reduces memory, libido etc. DMG also useful in workout and athletic performance and helps you to workout more and feels less soreness due to its ability to reduce lactic acid buildup. DMG 
does this because it supplies oxygen to cells much more effectively. DMG have many uses like its shown to reduce seizures, reduce inflammatory conditions and even useful for cancer treatment. There is a youtube video describing its benefits in detail. Title of the video is Winer Wellness Center Workshop _NAME_ G The Magic Pill DMG Its available to buy from online shopping sites like amazon and doesn’t require any prescription. Its ideal to take early morning as it gives energy and might affect sleep if taken afternoon or later."

What would real analysis help me with besides better understanding or proving algorithms? What about number theory? Topology? complex analysis? Abstract algebra? I was thinking software development or CS (not abet) with WGU. It’s cheaper and all online. Not sure which one I should do. I think I could get a BA/BS in 5 years if I get more motivation and drive.

There are other parameters for being high functioning but capacity to study is a key parameter; I think that you just need to learn to control intrusive thoughts and you might be successful in life. There are safe, non-medicative methods to deal with intrusive thoughts. The thought pressure you experience is familiar to me because I also used to suffer from thought pressure and still do to a certain degree. However, I have found safe, non -medicative methods that reduce the pressure, and they help me a great deal."

176137202,"My family is horrible and broken, always has been and it doesn’t ever seem to get any better no matter how much older I am. I’m constantly told that isolation is bad for me and that I need family supports but every time I try to improve rapport or relationships with family members it’s always horrible. Just the same old crap. I really don’t want anything to do with them, I’ve actually identified them as being stressors = trigger my bad mental health symptoms. I try to avoid them. I recently bought a new (second hand) car. This is a big achievement for me and should be a happy occasion. My old car is old but still goes & has been well maintained so I offered to gift it to my nephew who has just got his license. I spent all day cleaning it, washing it, arranging insurance, getting it ready & wrote up some driving tips for my nephew and went to the printers to print it. All ready to go drop the car off and at the last minute my sister calls. He doesn’t want the car. His father won’t let 
him have it 'cos he can’t afford to run it. They could have told me that a week ago but left it to the very last second after I’ve done all that work. Sacrificed my entire Sunday preparing the car for my nephew when I could have been out hiking or relaxing. It’s so disrepectful. I was just trying to be a nice aunt. My sister was her usual unapologetic, emotionally tonedeaf self and wasn’t even compassionate in breaking the news to me. She’s so rude and disrepectful to me I can’t believe I was dumb enough to offer to gift her son a car. Every time I try to do something positive with my family it is always horrible. I can’t believe I even bothered & didn’t just sell my car & take the money. I’m so angry and disgusted with them I can barely type this. Not really looking for any suggestions here, just need to vent. By the way, I’m new here. Where are you supposed to vent? My feelings don’t fit into Lounge or DX or any other folder."

176137208,Today was a bit odd. I felt very slow today and yesterday physically and mentally. Today I was with my gf and I stopped moving for like 15mins I felt like I was stuck.

Is there any medications you take or is there any specific type of therapy for this? For me it’s a major problem because I’m going to work next summer. The best thing would be for me to instantly sleep and wake up without struggle, but I have no idea how to do it."
176137210,"Cling to your insight. Beside medication I see no other options. In the past I was ignorant of my condition and took steps that were harmful or useless waste of time.

176137213,I’ve been on zyprexa for 24 years. I decided if I was gonna have to take meds the rest of my life it would have to be something I could tolerate. Thankfully the side effects from zyprexa aren’t bad other than feeling tired. I’ve tried other meds and some I couldn’t tie my own shoes I was so drugged. Working on zyprexa was very difficult. If I didn’t get 10 hours sleep I couldn’t barely make it through the day. Also getting laid off or fired I didn’t have insurance and would have had to pay cash for my meds. Zyprexa is $600 for a month supply. I had to go on disability because I kept losing my job and I needed stable health insurance. Having health insurance if you’re in America is something to consider when working with schiz.
176137214,I heard that once you hit your 30s you dont really change much.
176137215,This is reassuring. I hope I can sustain work and earn a living too. Well done for doing so.
176137216,Can’t say I haven’t tried but it’s a tough lesson to learn and you will need more meds to get back to where you were.
176137217,I don’t think so. Every person is deserving of love and deserves to be told they are worthy. Everyone deserves a second chance and you are no different. Your mom has probably said horrible things like this to you throughout your life that have shaped your self esteem this way. I hope someday you will be able to surround yourself with people who lift you up instead of tear you down when you are clearly already struggling.

176137225,"I’ve been on the psych wards a bunch of times, and each time it was different. It depends on the pdoc. Some like to change meds, some increase what you already take. I was even re-dxed a couple times(when that happened my real world pdoc would put me back on the right meds, since a new dx usually means different meds). A couple times when I got a bit out of control they gave me an extra dose of liquid Haldol and a 30 minute time out in the seclusion room. Always best to “go along to get along” in a situation like that. I’ve seen fellow patients get waaay out of control and even fight the attendants and they ended up getting four-pointed to a bed, a shot in the butt and several hours/overnight in the seclusion room. That didn’t look fun to me so I was cooperative even when I was worked up. All this stuff depends on the pdoc, the facility, and the country you are in(I’m in the USA). Nutcase"

174377058,"I wouldn’t go off the meds if I were you… I did that because I got a second opinion (hadn’t been on meds for months with no symptoms) they told me I had bipolar/ptsd… then 6 months later I was tripping again, hearing voices, seeing things, etc"
174377057,_AT_MENTION_ Which one is it? Here in Germany Abilify has that “side effect” in the leaflet.
176137266,Just wanted to tell y’all that I feel a lot better than a month ago
176137267,I like company but appreciate my alone time. So I’m an extrovert that likes some introvert behavior. This gets complicated rather quickly but that is me. I am aggresively social but exist in my own bubble so to speak. It does happen sometimes.
176137268,I’m sorry you’ve had bad experiences!
176137269,"I had psychosis NOS for a while. When my symptoms persisted, I got switched over to SZ."
176137270,Why? Do you have side effects?
176137271,_AT_MENTION_ I’ve heard that dt pop can wreak havoc on one’s weight by making one hungry. What did your doc say about it?
176137272,"I haven’t felt guilty a day in my life for receiving disability. I worked hard for a long time during my healthier years, I earned my work credits."
176137273,yeah just meeting with doc next week to discuss option
176137274,"I remember when a psychologist told me I had magical thinking, and I thought, what’s so strange about that?"
176137275,"Before medication, I once saw words going up and across the TV screen, to do with my relationship with my father. Also often when I closed my eyes I would see distorted faces, some of people I knew, some of people I had never met. Soon as I started medication that stuff went away."
176137276,I filled the form out myself as it didn’t work last time. I hope I get PIP. (Personal Independence payment). I should be entitled to it. Now I just need a letter from my cpn to confirm my diagnosis and just how much I rely on my mother to help remind me of things I need like meds and food etc.
176137277,"Of course, some of that chaos is in my own head."
176137278,I had one relationship about 5 years ago but I couldn’t cope with it and I just didn’t see her again. It only lasted a few months. She was so emotional and infatuated with me I honestly did not know how to respond to that because I didn’t like it at all. I think she was emotionally immature but equally I am not equipped enough to deal with someone like that. Her life choice to be a student for half her life also put me off as how do you build a life in work when your just wasting time studying something very niche with no transferable skills that I can think of
176137279,Too much and too many. Next question?
176137280,Have to be sure it doesn’t have the palmitate filler. That’s what’s correlated with lung cancer.
174377062,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ your experience is very interesting. Similar side effects as me. I might keep olanzapine as a PRN. It’s very effective. Hopefully aripiprazole works well too. I’ll try it and see. If not then it’s back to O again! I could also try lurasidone after A that’s also available here. I’ve been on O for over three years so I expect there will be some withdrawal effects. Can’t be helped I suppose. I heard some people get anxious initially on A I will have to ask for some lorazepam if that happens in my case (I have co-diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder so it’s likely?!)
176137281,Do you take anything for anxiety?
176137282,I dont want to tqke them

176137299,My primary doctor will only prescribe on the advice of the psychiatrist. If you get discharged and need urgent meds sorted you have to wait weeks
174377070,Yes so the mental health system does not have the wellbeing and happiness of the patient in mind but rather that they are kept subdued. That is depressing.

176137300,I’m not as nervous as I should be because I have respiratory problems (do to smoking) and I also have heart disease (I’ve had it since I was born) so basically my immune system is very weak. But to be safe I don’t go out to public much unless it’s an emergency. But I have strong belief it’ll pass eventually
176137301,I don’t really want to talk about it right now. I hope that’s ok.
176137302,I like it this way…
176137303,I seen running down the walls at times not as much as i used to though.
174377072,"What you describe are the classic symptoms of the schizoaffective diagnosis. I sometimes wonder if I’m not malingering. However, I’ve been hospitalized for mental illness over twenty times, and I think only two of those times were voluntary. Most of the time I was taken to the hospital in a police car in handcuffs. Can you get a med. change? If you’re saying you hate your guts you need something to help you pull out of it. I’ve seen you like this before. You really suffer from your mental illness. Have you tried antidepressants? Do you have friends, or are you isolated? Talk to your husband about his attitude. He isn’t helping."
176137304,"I was recently asked about what I believe my superpowers are when psychotic, and I thought it was a really interesting question! Also a slightly more positive way of framing some delusions I’ve had. Does anyone else have any they’d share with me? I believed others could read my mind, that I would rule the world with the color orange, and that the voices were the voices of the dead speaking to me, to name a few. I don’t think I’d really want any of these in this reality, but they seemed mostly interesting at the time."

Look at _PERSON_, that’s almost ‘colorful’. (But some people like to wreck beauty.)"
176137309,Yes I am doubting my therapist of 3 months can actually help me. But my pDoc and Caseworker wants me to get therapy. I feel like they don’t understand Schizophrenia. Frustrated. Sorry you are having this terrible experience with your Therapist.
176137310,"I skipped my meds last night because I took a supplement. I took them this morning. How can I take my night time doses if I already took them at 8am?

176137320,I must say- Schizophrenia is a brain disease “And I have learnt it.” Now normal but for precautions taking meds.
176137321,"I eat according to the hunger scale. When my hunger is a 3 on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 meaning starvation and 10 meaning overstuffed, thats when I eat. I quit eating at about a 7. I also eat by asking myself these three questons: Is it delicious? Nutritious? And moderate? I never put together a meal unless it’s got all 3 qualities. Finally, I’ve learned to accept the natural weight that my body wants to be instead of trying to force it into a mold. After all, my BMI is normal. What’s my problem? I still count my calories. Just so my weight doesn’t creep up. I’m on three AP’s after all."

It gives you better genetic variance over asexual reproduction and more ability to survive outbreaks. Outbreaks became common with city living.

176137327,"I’ve been in the “everything is a computer simulation” frame. It’s pretty ?????? up. Got scared that I was breaking reality. Had weird computery experiences.

176137350,"During this last year and a strange one it has been, I’ve had the very real realization that my ‘voices’ have increased tenfold, though I have been able to not act out or give them an open display of trauma or feeling towards it. It also now has the ability to hack my computer, flash a momentary bright blue laser light of some description, and stand unnervingly outside my bedroom window at night, as I can see their shadow upon my wall through the window blind. A bit like a strange voyeur or something. It is also accompanied by constant laughing out in the street, while I just go about my business during the lockdown. The worst part is when in the bathroom, pooing, or washing. Has anybody else noticed an increase within their ‘voices’."

176137352,I had thursday friday Saturday off. Thursday I hung out with my boyfriend and just relaxed. Friday I slept in then went to my cousin’s wedding which was fun. Slept more on saturday and visited family in the evening. I’m actually pretty proud of myself. I’m still casual at my previous job and they were short staffed yesterday and the shift was offered to me. Normally I wouldn’t be able to say no. But I knew that I needed the least amount of stress possible and my previous job is very stressful so I said no. Which is actually a pretty big thing for me to say no.
176137353,"True, nothing at all is still better and that’s what I said earlier: “I am not saying go out and vape if you don’t smoke but if you do, vaping is 95% safer.” I can’t stop vaping because I am always bored from my negative and cognitive symptoms. Nicotine gives me some boost like caffeine."
176137354,"What I hate is when someone commits a mass shooting or something and the news jumps over itself to try and find any mental disorder to diagnose them with.

Quick, turn them into an inhuman monster so we can pretend we are inseparably different from them by more than just our choices!"

m people and keep quiet about my suffering faking the smile like I’m fine “If no one know I’m exist then I’m not attention seeker/faker/malinger” “If I do not exist no one can hurt me anymore” just paranoid or just negative view I even ask for factitious disorder in dx so I can finally feel all the pressure end not just said it’s delusion but treat me like faker If they think I’m faking it for attetion why don’t give something like hysteria but yes that is not in DSM anymore but I’m not in US so I don’t know if they use DSM 5 or ICD 10 If they think I’m faking it why don’t they just make it clear did they worry about losing their job so keep me suffer in doubt? No that probably I’m paranoid or worse I’m just bad person thinking bad about them or just them being ‘kind’ don’t want to give me that diagnosed I want to get help, I wan tto ask parents to paid for my meds but we are poor, and cheap one is hurt me so bad to point I’m crying cover in my own drool from screaming 
in pain but people keep tell me to bear it, it’s just a pain yep I’m not trying enough, I just want everything to end(not the world I mean me) I don’t want to hear “friend I think you are good person” like people in my life always say I don’t need it, I just want to stop all of this because no matter how many people think I’m good person if I myself thinking I’m a bad person, I will be in suffering no matter people believe in me, it’s worthless if I don’t believe in myself if only I can afford those expensive pills and expensive private session(not government hospital) don’t mind me, because I think I’m attention seeking again I have to be fine I’m sorry and I know no one here have ideal how to deal with my situation I don’t want to post in say anythign thread because I don’t want to bring negative there so left this empty don’t reply to this topic I’m sorry I just want to vent here I can’t think straight right now sorry"
176137390,_AT_MENTION_ what about negative and cognitive symptoms…
176137391,I agree with _AT_MENTION_. Trust your instincts.
176137392,"Yes. It is possible to be suidical, but not be depressed. There are multiple illnesses that impair your judgement and compel you to commit suicide. I believe, that a decision to end one’s life is never rational. Especially if it is not in the face of adversity (killing yourself, so that your near and dear can live; killing yourself to end unbearable, non-treatable torment), it cannot really be justified. I would suggest talking to a professional, be it a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist. It is very difficult to see what is wrong with us, from within. It is very likely, that with a bit of assistance your life quality will improve in a way you cannot really envision now."
176137393,Wasn’t targeted at you just the thread. I’ve struggled myself figuring out the whole work thing like if it’s even worth it. I get SSI not SSDI different rules.
176137394,I was taking 15mg risperidone pills. I also have tried consta depot
176137395,Independently with little or no support Independently with quite a lot of support Independently with a lot of support With parents or other family member Group home or equivalent 0 voters For me it’s ‘Independently with quite a lot of support’.
176137396,52 years and counting with a bad heart. Take away my head meds and I crash big time within six months. Some problems you can live with easier than others.
176137397,Ive been on the vape for bout 20 days… havent bought a pack. Sort of still waiting for my lung capacity to return. Saved 100 so far… Healthier and cheaper… and I can get away with vaping. My car is cleaner too… Might be worth considering. The nicotine salt based vapor delivery systems do pack a punch.
176137398,?? ?_USER_ID_????
176137399,I’m so sorry. I will pray for you and your mom. I’m glad she’s been so good to you. *hugs
176137400,Since I was a kid. It’s been a very long time.
176137401,"Social Media is full of them tbh,i quit these platforms years ago, best thing i have ever done."
176137402,General nursing pays good too. Have you thought of this? I know a mental health nurse. He’s a mate of mine and we can talk shop but it’s a very high stressed and violent stream of nursing. He had numerous issues and he’s totally out of the field now… I know it seems like you’d have some understanding but in reality your dealing with people burned out on meth and other such folk…All’s I’m saying. Normal nursing has a lot of fields and although a lot use shift work which is hard on meds…it pays well.
176137403,That would be really useful. I find it really frustrating because its not something _PERSON_ doing on purpose and I don’t even know when _PERSON_ doing it.
176137404,Be proud no matter what. You’ll find a new niche!
176137405,I was looking at those. They had caffeine in them. I had enough caffeine 2day
176137406,yea that’s why i thought you wouldn’t like hearing it… but if it is the solution then that is good though huh… but you first gotta talk to a doctor about it… i don’t know till what point heart rates are ok… but i just can imagine that having it that high all the time isn’t healthy…

174377102,"i’m not sure the risperdal is sedating for me, i get a shot 50mg every 2 weeks but i also take clozapine and that sedates me after i take it and then i fall asleep. But i couldn’t say the risperdal is sedating to me."
176137410,I don’t want to be one either.
176137411,So what’s next for you _PERSON_?
176137412,_PERSON_ congrats
176137413,That good attitude should help you towards your recovery. Good luck!

176137416,Awww baby Other _AT_MENTION_! I really like the name _NAME_
176137417,"This study was with just 10 people, and no control group, so they have to study it more. But it does seem like it could be very helpful for some people. I don’t think doctors will be comfortable with it until there are more studies. I certainly hope it can help people who don’t have other options."
176137418,I am. Going to hang. End. Of story
176137419,"I used to give to the homeless in town here in Bognor - but they have been getting increasingly aggressive with begging lately, and once you give them a quid, they will follow you next time they see you, so i dont bother. Lots of complaints about them latley - they turn up to scrounge off the Tourists."
176137420,"This reminds me of the movie ‘The beautiful mind’ in which _NAME_ had hallucinations that he had a friend while he studied in the university. No friends existed and it was all his hallucination. I have had all kinds of delusions in the past, but never any visual hallucinations of people."

176137422,makes me want a new kitten
176137423,"I have been feeling as though there’s something crawling on me all day. When I look there’s nothing there. I would even keep looking at where I felt it and would feel it again on the same spot and there would be nothing. Then the feeling just keeps moving. I’ve had this before and it just never made sense to me at all. Does anyone else get this as well? I thought it could be a medical thing when I tried to research it, but now with the whole “hallucinations” aspect of things it changes things. It’s still happening now and it’s taking me forever to type this out because of it. It’s freaking me out!"
176137424,"HI there, I used to be on Haldol injection for a year now. I started at 50 ml injection each 2 weeks. the doctor was delaying the duration between each injection periodically . Now he asked me to stop taking the injection once for all. It has been 2 weeks now since i last took the injection, so theoretically I am still under its effect. during all that period, I have been oversleeping ,more than 11 hours a day, feeling sedated all the day and taking many naps during the day. that was not all of it, after long hours of sleep I wake up drowsy and tired. I don’t know if this is the effect Haldol on me, while my doctor is saying that haldol doesn’t cause sleepiness. Is there anyone facing same problem as me?"
176137425,"There is no irreversible damage from the meds, you’re imagining it. Chillax."
176137426,"If you type your own email into google, the targeted search will show you all your sites you use the account at. But only you can see those results, and only when you’re logged into google."
176137427,I think consciousness is an illusion and doesn’t exist in any real form aside from the workings of our mind. When the mind does so goes everything else I do have another view that goes that we are already dead and just remembering our lives as we move thru time.

176137430,"lol, I don’t know, just trying to be friendly"
176137431,hi _AT_MENTION_ sorry you had a nightmare. Hope you can get back to sleep quickly.
176137432,"It’s just voices in your mind, created by your mind. Don’t pay them any attention."
176137433,Looks good _AT_MENTION_
176137434,"Not the best way to put it, obviously. But it is true you have to try to reach for life. Giving a supplement a good month or two is more of a try than lying in bed."
174377105,I didn’t have suicidal thoughts anymore since switching my meds to risperdal in combo with clozapine (i also take sertraline and l-thyroxine though). I’m not really sure what helped to get rid of the suicidal thoughts.
176137435,"I jogged (walked and jogged) today around 5:30am, I don’t like walking under the trees because I don’t want caterpillars to fall on me. I’ve never liked looking at them. I don’t like bugs which wriggle with no bones or look moist or have a lot of legs which move fast, or seem like they have personalities and are thinking; like cockroaches, I don’t like loud cars when people are going to work. I took roundabout sorts of routes, some people passed me, and I made eye contact with a couple of them and felt at ease. It was at least 2 miles. I took 400mg l-theanine around 5am. I woke up around 4am."
176137436,Maybe oatmeal
176137437,In my country you can get a doctor who knows you to write a letter on your behalf just mentioning an ongoingng illness. They don’t need to be specific
176137438,I know it’s not exactly the same but I had a hamm radio license but it expired.
174377109,I solved schizophrenia.
176137439,Homophobia is really ridiculous sometimes.
174377107,"They do I believe. Some drs still write it as sz though. Officially I’m not sz but a hospital dr wrote sz and so it’s a bit confusing for me, I don’t meet the timespan requirements either"
176137441,Good luck _AT_MENTION_ !
176137442,When I was really little I had a Nascar backpack that my parents took from me and gave to one of my brothers lol. Oddly enough I think they were the ones who got it for me in the first place??

176137447,Find out the target’s faulty beliefs and lock them in a room of pundits whose goal is to prove them false.
176137448,Sometimes doctors are so merciless and inflexible with patients desires to leave the ward. It would have been better to have them on a community treatment of order than be confined to a corona stricken ward
176137449,_AT_MENTION_ I truly believe any of us could do it. You never know what you are capable of when you have the right supports and the ability to believe in yourself.
176137450,I talked to a pharmacist and there is no narcotic safe to take with selegiline. I don’t know what people take if they have surgery or get injured. Scary. I didn’t know
176137451,Or can remember junior high school.
174377110,I mean maybe she should go off her meds and see how she does it took me doing that to accept I had schizophrenia was not fun though
176137452,"Hi, I’ve been diagnosed with psychosis. But lately I’m feeling feelings that aren’t mine. Like I feel sensitive and clingy to my mom. Little girlish and hiding when someone new is around. I’m 36. This shouldn’t be happening to me. I’m aware the whole day. I have all of my past memories. I have no idea what’s going on. I guess I want to know if anyone diagnosed feels the same? I think I may have to talk to a psychiatrist, but my case was closed because my mental health wasn’t getting any worse or better…I’m confused"
176137453,I’ve been told it is outright not possible. If it were possible then maybe I could have built good coping mechanisms for it but instead I spent years telling myself it isn’t possible while it happens consistently. Doctors and family agree so from now on I just accept that its all delusion and hallucination. Hope the next medication regime is a good one.
176137454,Congratulation i know from experience how hard it is. Im not trying to downplay that by asking this question but am curious. You said you went home and started taking all the pills you had and drinking alcohol. I was just wondering if you quit taking pills too?
176137455,"Well it was either here or McDonalds. I chose _NAME_in_PERSON_the_PERSON_Box and I’ve never, ever regretted my decision the whole hour I was here. As an adult, you make your own decisions and live with the consequences."
174377115,I never double booked was fully committed
176137456,It’s so good _AT_MENTION_!
174377111,Trauma. Medication use might have contributed to it.
174377108,"I just get anxious easily, when on a group of unknown people for example, stress control is key, right now I need some vacations as I haven’t had any in like 2 years, when I feel fine I don’t just feel fine I feel great! when anxious tho everything changes lol Good nutrition, sleeping, no substances (caffeine) are also key, I can’t fail on those. About the diagnosis, a personality disorder makes way more sense, I have never had allucinations, always been high functioning, etc One of the personality disorders says the individual doesn’t care about social interaction, as a kid I used to be like that, I was indifferent to people, now it’s the other way around, I’m very social."
176137457,I think _AT_MENTION_ makes a very good point. I hope your husband gets better soon. It might make a difference to your mental health.
174377113,Yes risperidone is more effective than abilify. Risperidone is also very good for cognition[1]. Abilify is actually mediocre in curing positive symptoms but has good side effects profile. [2] [1] http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/2/233.full.pdf [2] http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/news/events/2013/september/Leucht-2013-15-antipsychotics-_NAME_-analyses.pdf
174377112,"I don’t trust her abilities with with someone like us. And maybe that’s a big part of it. You know she once told me “you aren’t like other schizophrenic patients I have” That left me with questions…that’s what I should do, write out a questionnaire for her."
176137458,Sexual function can be an issue if you don’t have sex. I’ve found that sex sorts out a lot of problems. Without it your overthinking it and things are a little different in reality. I changed meds for sexual function but I wasn’t in a relationship and had no clue as to what was necessary. Simple question. Have you had sex?
176137459,I have the same negatives as you. I stopped the injection 3 months ago and I’m still suffering from horrible side effects.
176137460,"Hmm. I Was Thinking. Kinda Randomly With Such An Interesting Public Conversation. With Such Different Opinions & Beliefs. I Wonder, Does The Activity Within Sexual Desire Fall Under The Cause Of Boredom?. And If There Is Any Truth To That, And Such Pain Within It, Why Not Find More Constructive Things To Participate In?. Perhaps Something That Start A Wildfire Of Pure Amazing Love?. Anyone?. Sincerely, DJ _PERSON_ Beat Beam (sleepoptimistic) P.s. Her Spark Built Imaginary Building’s Without Insecurity That Controlled Her Endless Fate."
176137461,Maybe like in what about _NAME_. baby steps. i will just do the phone support groups for right now. i think.
176137462,"I know I said it before, but man do you have some serious talent."
176137463,pub4menow ok no yes r no
176137464,"Yes, but I carried to an extreme. An occasional pity party is fine in my book."
176137465,Or writing literature perhaps. I suck at drawing pictures but I’m not bad at coloring. Some people have told me I have a creative mind because I can write imaginative stuff. But your definition doesn’t necessarily fit me.
176137466,Which one is better - fluoxetine or paroxetine ? What side effects u got on either on them ? Did u had memory problems on paroxetine(paxil) ?
176137467,Used to. But on shots now.
176137468,I’m wondering if somehow one of the molecules of the med’s I have been taken have gotten tweaked from another molecule in another of my med’s so that it turned into methamphetamine. I’m still kind of shaky.
176137469,"ok, try ad avoid those things if you can, focus on other things, distract yourself and be nice to yourself and others hopefuly that will help, ask yourself what you think will help you, try searching yourself for the answer if you can hope this helps"
176137470,"I pray for the people who hurt or continue to hurt me. I learned that from my childhood religion and then when I grew up in 12 steps it was suggested to me again. It was suggested that I pray the abuser to receive everything good I want for myself in their life. I don’t have to actually be sincere (in the beginning) in the praying but I just have to say/think the prayers. Over time the praying worked for me and anger lifted. I feel freer [now] having prayed for their “health, happiness, and prosperity.” This expression helped me get perspective too “anger is the poison I take expecting someone else to die.”"
176137471,"I’m glad you have found a well negotiated situation for work! They probably know they’re leaning on you at the office, even if they don’t show it… to have stepped up and made things reasonable for you. Keep it going for them… that’s some job security."
176137472,it’s ok =) almost time to go watch some tv and wait till i take my meds and fall asleep. What you gonna do for the rest of the day?
176137473,"LS! For me it is near the end of the day. So I did most things already. 1 Exercise 30 minutes on my rowing machine, an hour walking to shops, 30 minutes yoga, I still have to do 30 minutes rowing 2 Do my laundry ( I am doing that right now) 3 Phone my mom (I already did that, she can not see anybody because of the virus and I phone her every day for about 15 minutes"

176137476,"I don’t tell people about my illness. I get treated as a moron all of the time though. I don’t know what it is. I try to sound intelligent. But sounding intelligent and being intelligent are different. Lol, maybe, I AM STUPID?!!!"
174377124,_AT_MENTION_ what happened when you were on clozapine?
176137477,I’ve stopped smoking for over 27 years and I still have ciggy cravings. Horrible addiction.
176137478,"Dunning kruger syndrome is not an accepted diagnosis (to be honest I’ve got some issues with it myself). In a nutshell it refers to people who seriously overestimate their abilities, but not necessarily across all domains."
176137479,I was like that but I’ve become a bit more calm about it. I’m just hoping for the best at this point.

176137499,Congratulations on your anniversary.
176137500,_AT_MENTION_. Lol wow
176137501,Just a question… Is a severe panic attack similar to Psychosis in a way? Thoughts?
174377133,"So when I was told I had psychosis , I took the antipsychotics for 10 years… but I have not had a psychosis in that time. I only ever had one psychosis so they helped me come of meds as I was responding to treatment. I trusted them"
176137502,"Thats what I did. I was at 4mg of risperdal and went down by half a milligram every five days. I just recently got off of it, so we’ll see how it goes."
176137503,that sucks… my pdoc is busy too. i only got a new appointment for in 6 months cause his agenda is fully booked.
176137504,"I’ve been doing neurofeedback and that has helped me. When you lose the bored feeling, at least some of your motivation comes back(in my experience)."
176137505,"My opinion might be a bit controversial but… Us humans aren’t meant to be happy, at least how are mind is hard wired. Happiness is a pursuit of subjective satisfaction but that is just it a pursuit. Maybe you can find comfort in you are not alone. I know I’m never happy but the moments I do feel it I appreciate it, those small moments of bliss and mindfulness. Those are unforgettable, instead of wishing for eternal happiness wish for blissful eternal memories."
176137506,That is great…Methylcobalmin shots can be good. I wish I could get them as it still helps symptoms. Even though my B-12 is fine supposably every time I get Methyl B-12 shots it helps symptoms One doctor said it can help methylation which might be why.
176137507,I feel society often uses these terms with negative connotations but we aren’t looking at it this way here… we in this group are looking at it another way not to critise you for being delusional… its so you can realise that what your thinking isn’t common and the reality of the situation… so we basically saying you will need meds to see things in a clearer light like most people
176137508,You’re a good guy _AT_MENTION_ .

174377146,"I have worked the other symptoms out. If there is a specific neural code when a task is learnt, then holding the racket the wrong way would actually represent that code. Now since new learning cannot take place if there are deficits in these regions, the habit has been formed, and then correct learning cannot take place. In other words I cannot relearn the correct way to hold a racket. Hence, this would extend to step-wise learning tasks. This would explain my symptoms of not being able to mimic signatures, or to be able to hold the table tennis bat the correct way. These are not step-wise tasks, but step-wise learning is merely an extension of this one-step learning. I actually have a way out here. It is to trick the brain in a very complicated way so that new learning takes place. My first attempt would be, though, to do Mathematics more and more. If the brain is plastic, then the deficiencies in the executive function would diminish. If Clozapine can worsen it, and the brain is plastic enough to

176137600,"That’s just stupid I’m afraid Signs and symptoms of Ativan overdose include: Lethargy and fatigue: Benzodiazepine overdose victims will not feel or act like themselves. Though sleepiness is a common side effect of Ativan use, in greater duration, this may be a sign of excessive intoxication. Uncoordinated behavior: Sedation may result in inexplicable spasms or loss of motor function entirely. Stumbling is likely and reflexes will be all but gone. Profuse sweating: Victims may have a clammy or glossy appearance to their skin. Memory loss: Lorazepam is used to prevent new memories from forming during surgery, and this effect may translate over during an overdose state. Such confusion can lead to erratic, unforeseen behavior. Most importantly, a person overdosing on Ativan can experience breathing issues, which can lead to heart attack, coma and death. If any of these symptoms develop, call 9-11. It’s vital the overdosing person gets treatment immediately."

I worry about that a lot. He says he wants to be with me and that he loves me, but things have been strained lately and I am scared. I just want my family to stay together.

I believe we are all Gods Within us all we have light We need to find it a way to spark it So we can ignite our true lives.

174377166,"Hello everybody, How are you all? It’s been a while since I posted but I have been living alone, and on my own, much of 2019 with lots of thoughts swirling around my head. I felt like sharing some of these with you guys today: Life is redemption! Life is designed to be tough to give each and every one of us the chance to redeem ourselves from the bad karma of our past lives and ultimately be free from suffering as we pass through at the end. Everyone will cause you suffering, it’s the ones that are worth suffering for that you need to find – I did discover through my ‘normal’ girlfriend that even her husband and his family are a source of contention for her. She suffers for him, even though they are the text book ‘happy family’. I’ve come to the conclusion that there are no wholly ‘happy’ people/families who live eternally blissful lives. If they say they are, then they’re lying (… and doesn’t everyone like to say they are on social media, too?) If you’re open about livi
ng with a condition like schizophrenia, people will not (as I had thought) cushion your ride with them. Interestingly I broke my ankle some years ago and was on crutches to the office for two weeks. It was very hard to walk on those and not once did anyone offer to fetch me a drink or glass of water. They watched me struggle and did nothing. Generally, mental or non-mental, people are selfish and don’t help those of us in need. **E.g. I had a dream about a crush guy a few months back, that he helped me over a bridge during a tough time breaking up with my long term partner _PERSON_. I told about him this in waking life, in a note I sent with some flowers. He thanked me and said: “Maybe I should try to help people in real life…” I felt so alienated. Can you imagine going through life without helping others? Isn’t helping people the ‘point’? A lot of people don’t help others though and I find this upsetting. I wondered what ‘the point’ is of life for other people? I know another guy, an art 
dealer in Milan, told me when he was aged 25 that he has stopped helping others as a matter of principle, because no-one ever helped him. I’ve also heard social scientists saying: “Social justice… or what’s the point?” They think live spirals and centres on their fields of work which I find intriguing. I’m not sure if anyone can relate to these thoughts or feel like passing comment or striking a conversation with a lonely gal from the UK. TAKE HOME: A psychiatrist once told me that when we’re stable, people with schizophrenia are more kind, considerate and compassionate than the general populace…"

176137652,My doctor prescribed it to me to treat my insulin resistance. I also need to lose weight as I am around 60 lbs overweight.
176137653,"May just be because I’m on break, this tends to happen when I dont have something to keep me occupied. I’ve just been in a depressive mood, real gloomy and dissatisfied with things. The repetition of every day has been driving me crazy. Wake up. Take meds. Make breakfast. Eat breakfast. Do whatever until I can see boyfriend. Brief hours of happiness. Leave boyfriends house. Brush teeth and change into pajamas. Bed. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. It’s like if I am not actively working towards something, I lack a sense of progression and life feels mundane and meaningless. But when I am working towards something, I am stressed and just wish I could be done. It feels like a lose lose. Perhaps a very fine balance is required. But that’s not easy to obtain. Anyways that’s just an update from me."

176137669,"So _NAME_ for example is the high level looking down on a situation, so when I look out from my perspective and try to think about my life from a further removed perspective I’ve begun to personify the occurrences that have brought me month to month, to have some sort of intent. I’m an atheist I don’t believe in higher powers, so I think this might be a sign of the grandiose sense of self image coming back. I can’t really increase my medications effectiveness so I’m thinking of going to therapy about it once I see it as safe and they can get me into see someone with all this corona crap going on. I’m wary of these sort of bleed through things and hopeful that if I keep an eye on them I can avoid relapse but I don’t know how worried to be. Generally the last time I felt any sort of religious sentimentality I was close to having a psychotic break and then the break occured within a timeline of a few hours…but with this being me while medicated I’m concerned that I won’t know the s
igns before its already happened. Its kinda bumming me out. I want to stay stable on this medication because it allows me to lose weight and I tolerate it well compared to others I’ve been on."

174377173,"Impulsivity, compulsivity, addictions and hypersexuality are rare side effects of Abilify but they happened to me.

I emptied my bank account and was drawing cash from Visa. My credit score is so bad now that I got declined for a 300$ limit Visa. My parents paid all my debts. The first psychiatrist who put me on it asked me about those side effects but I was 20y.o. shy and it wasn’t as serious as later. Never thought that a chemical can cause these and change my personality for the worse."

176137675,That said delusions about terrorism are not the kind that schizophrenics suffer from. This makes me believe that the things I’m scared of are really happening to me. I’ve seen ones where they are victims of Al Quaeda but not actually working for them.
176137676,hmm i might ask that
176137677,"Some of the best advice I ever heard is that “people who say that anger builds up are wrong”. The thing is that if you BELIEVE that you build up anger then your mind will believe that and focus and dwell on all of the negativity (which is dangerous) , whereas if we find a way to deal with the issues from our past through either acceptance or action, we can move past these things that technically aren’t even a part of our current reality. My personal method is to convert my frustrated energy into something creative or redirect it into a different direction than getting generally mad.

Problem is he didn’t really have any alternatives other than the vistaril and propranolol (both of which I’ve tried but don’t do much for my anxiety). I guess when I meet with my psychiatrist I’ll see if he has any other ideas. In the mean time I’m gonna see how the L-theanine along with broccoli sprout extract helps."

176137710,"Wasn’t sure where to post this (Feel free to move). Storytime: I have a friend (call him X) who I’ve known for 17 year roughly. He was very supportive of me when I had my breakdown and ever since then. Always encouraging me to come out, share music, etc. As was his girlfriend (we’ll call _PERSON_) who I’ve been very close friends with and also known for a similar time period. A year ago X cheated on his Y. They’d had multiple breaks before but never due to cheating. Y was really upset and distraught for months. They had been talking about moving away together and it obviously came out of no where. _PERSON_ cheated with someone he had just met while he was on holiday (in another country) and it seemed kind of something that he obviously initiated. All my friends with him and made it known they were upset with him and that it wasnt okay. And he kind of understood he made a bad choice. I kind of told him I thought it was really dumb and that if he wasn’t happy he should have just said and 
it wouldn’t have been a big deal. But overall I also tried to be supportive as I knew he didn’t have many people trying to help him. But he would tell me about his new girl friend (Z) and it would really upset me, but I tried to just keep it to myself. I thought how long can a relationship in two different countries actually last? And expected it to fizzle out. I also thought eventually I’d get used to it, and it was the period of change I was struggling with. Well fast-forward a year, and X and Z now live together in the same country and have been together. At the same time, I’ve been hanging out with Y a lot more than X (as have all our friends). Actual problem: The problem I have is that while I want to be friends with X still, I physically/emotionally don’t feel like I can be. I quit our band because I just feel really uncomfortable with him. I was sometimes having intrusive thoughts about making a scene in our band sessions. Imagining answering questions bitterly to take him down a peg. Even wi
th more people and less focused environment I still, feel really resistant and kind of nervous around him. Even when I’m not having intrusive thoughts I just feel distrustful. I’d like to move past it, but I don’t know how. Again its not that I dislike him, I just physically don’t feel trusting of him. Does anyone have advice?"

174377201,"Nope, my GF had a psychotic episode 5 months ago, and this is what led to it. It started as a normal conspiracy theory about artists and politics, nothing out of the normal range. At one point, 1 week before the psychotic break, the theory importance exploded. She found out about many famous artist dying in mysterious circumstances and that made the conspiracy much more important. She then started researching and thinking about her theory all day long and in 1 week ended up in a psychotic state. She never had conspiracy theories before and does not have schyzotypal traits. On the contrary, I would say she is in the rather rationalist 50% of the population. No childhood trauma, no other factors either. The only thing about her was the severely low self esteem she was experiencing at the moment due to life circumstances + social isolation + small weed consumption. The high-dopamine, psychotic state lasted for only around 3 weeks. But still, she maintains her original delusions that, in short, claim s
he is super special and important, like any other conspiracy theory. The only mechanism that maintain her delusions at the moment are the normal mechanisms that are at work in any belief/delusion. Her dopamine has been back to normal after those 3 weeks, so her thinking outside of the delusional topic is not affected."

176137747,Got suspended for ”trolling” I haven’t trolled but I understand why some people might see it that way
176137748,so you didn’t really fake it… you just think inside that you faked it but the symptoms were real
176137749,Thankyou guys. This illness is hard.
176137750,"…like robots. For example a broken arm, the surgeon straighten it and bandage, give it a 6 weeks rest and the broken arm is cured. Sz ?"
176137751,Are you inconsolable? I’m quite sure you have nothing to worry about.
176137752,I’m having issues telling if things are real lately. And I want to hear how you guys reality check.
176137753,Measure your baseline resting pulse before and after if you still want to try. Mine is 71 atm and I’m having just little anxiety.

176137758,I really hope at least some of these make it to market. I’m running out of options and would love to try some of these when my current meds inevitably stop working.
176137759,"I sat and felt a little upset with myself. I had nothing I wanted to do and I had very few interests. I have a few friends and I was not interested in doing anything with them. I couldn’t understand what was wrong with me. I realized I do not want to fill all of my time with “things-to-do.” I needed time to myself to think things through. You see, I am somewhat introverted. That is the way I am. I need a few hours sometimes to sit and think, to myself. I need the time. Then I can learn to cope with my life in general. I still have a problem with activities and plans, but I have reached a new understanding. I will work on this further."

176137775,"That is all the doctors at this point are saying. Unless there’s fever and a few other key symptoms. It’s viral is the answer. My kids are out of sick days, but the doc says don’t bring them in cause it’s a waste of money. The pediatrician did yell at our school admins though, saying it was stupid to require a doctor’s note to be excused, yet send an email every few days saying if sick don’t come to school. He told them my kids are taking off if they feel sick, he’ll back date a note if they wanna pay for it. We kept them home today, all 3 kids and my hubby and I went to Applebee’s for my early bday dinner last night…3am hit and I had 3 teens fighting over the bathroom. _PERSON_ and I have not been feeling well, but luckily ours has been less severe. Can’t say if it was the food or just the virus going around again. But I called the school line at 4am and said they weren’t coming in. The pediatrician has done all he can do to help, he’s bent over backwards. My doc and urgent 
care, well, ???? them. They did nothing except check temp and blood pressure. Said OTC, fluids, and sleep. _AT_MENTION_ can you take like Tums soft chews? Those have helped my upset tummy more than regular hard Tums/Rolaids, as those make me throw up pretty quick. The soft chews I can tolerate, and 1 usually helps quickly if you have excess stomach acid from the virus we had/have."

176137781,Are they friends that you enjoy to be around and talk too? If they ain’t then try to steer away from them. But if they give you comfort and joy then it’s harmless in my opinion
174377215,I tried abilify for over a year but it didn’t work out. Went back to zyprexa. I gained most of my weight on risperdal. I’ve lost on zyprexa…that is the thing…it’s hard to know what works for you without trying others.
176137782,When I was super psychotic. Everyone’s eyes were on me. Everything wasn’t what it appeared. People were monsters. But I was despised for existing.
176137783,"When i become psychotic, i have no insight into what is going on. Now that i’m medicated, i still have some delusional thinking but at least i can recognise it.

I been blaming myself and telling myself that I’m doing something wrong for a year and my symptoms are so messed up that I thought he had every right to crush my spirits and I was telling myself for some insane reason that is how life works and that he is right and I’m wrong. But it AIN""T how life works. The fact is he isn’t someone special with special powers who has the power of right and wrong and doles out righteous punishment and speaks for mankind. He’s a tiny friggin punk peon who’s a little punk hater who’s out for himself for his own selfish sick gains. The little bitc*. I may have anhedonia, I may not. I feel at least some pleasure in life, in fact a lot. I’m pissed at myself for not seeing this crap sooner. Today was a great day.

Quitting has completely eliminated all the memory problems that I used to blame on my schizoaffective disorder, and I no longer worry about death like I did when I was high. It’s hard to accept that you can’t party with your friends anymore but it’s important to realize that if you are dealing with any mental issues you simply have to stay away from that stuff. I’m really enjoying the extra 160$ per month I’m saving from not buying marijuana, also. Never plan on touching the stuff ever again. Every trip was a bad trip the last couple months I smoked it."

174377220,"Unfortunately, antipsychotics seem to be the lesser of two evils. They don’t really seem to prevent schizophrenic neurodegeneration, only slow it. My pdoc says that, in theory, antipsychotics are only to be prescribed when prescribing them will cause less damage than not prescribing them, and that patients who do take them should only be taking the lowest effective dose. Hopefully, in time, treatments for a wide variety of neurodegenerative effects will improve."

My boyfriend and I are long distance so I thought since I haven’t seen him in a while he must not be real. And no one is real. And everything I know about a person I made up in my head, and nothing existed before I was born. My therapist said if my delusions get worse I might have to be hospitalized, but I’ve been hospitalized three times and it seriously traumatized me. She didn’t offer any coping skills on reality testing so I was wondering if yall had any tips on how I can be sure that I’m not the only one who exists. I’ve been asking my boyfriend to send me pictures and talk about memories we have and it’s been helping a little, but I’m still scared."

Idk, probably some residual from one of my breaks. It definitely sucks when the negativity snowballs on you. Its kind of like people think you’re socially ????????/awkward, so they want to ???? with you, even though you’re probably more intelligent than most of them. Just the stupid games some people play to entertain themselves I guess."

176137846,"I see. I’m not your doctor, but in my experience, unless the weight gain is more than 20 lbs (about 9 kg) a doctor won’t take it seriously as a side effect. No doc I’ve had has ever taken foggy thoughts as a serious side effect. If I have complained about less serious side effects, my doc usually wants me to have been stable for at least 6 months on the same dose with no serious symptoms before making any change. It sucks for those 6 months, but remember you want to play the long game. Changing a med as soon as you are stable makes your brain worse, not better, and increases your chances of needing meds for life."

176138031,There is a lot of discrimination and _USER_ID_ surrounding a SZ/SZA diagnosis. I find that many doctors and health professionals discriminate the most. It’s best not to disclose your SZ diagnosis unless it’s absolutely necessary. Frankly it’s no one’s business.

176138037,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . I told my son a little more. My mum doesnt want us to speak to him at all, but I dont find it fair to let him in the dark, while he notices us cry, notices her get weaker. I find it wrong if he feels it, but doesnt know, and will be suddenly confronted with the facts. I told him things with my mums belly arent okay and she isnt feeling well. That thursday we get more outcomes. And that some things might change in his schedule, because she is sick. That we will discuss things with him when we know more and he can always speak to us. I also spoke to his teacher. My wise little son says we have to think good thoughts while things are unsure, so we dont worry in advance."

176138041,"I acted on it last night. Don’t think of a plan because your more likely to follow through. My depression isn’t as bad so from experience, suicidal thoughts are temporary"
176138042,"I don’t mean all day. And I don’t mean every day. But just enough good things happen every day to make getting up in the morning worthwhile. But whenever I think of the situation at home it depresses me. Like _AT_MENTION_ said, no one knows my situation but me. I know what everybody says and I know what everybody thinks about it. (Because you’ve told me). And I believe you are all partially right. But when someone embarrasses me by saying that the neighbors are innocent and that they aren’t doing anything and that they have never done anything and it’s all me…I don’t want to use the word “ignorant” but it’s not appreciated and very misinformed. I’ll cop to being wrong about a lot of things and I’ll cop to blowing things out of proportion but when neighbors are changing my life and changing me as a person, I take it very seriously. Whew, got that off my chest now I feel better and now the timing is perfect to enjoy my crappy chili from _NAME_’s and enjoy the soda I earned. 
I had a fair day at work, people were friendly as usual and on the commute home there were only a maximum of 4 other drivers who were jerks, the rest were OK.

176138045,Try to use as much whole grains food as possible because you will feel full much longer. Cook vegetables for every meal. Eat the largest amount of food in the morning and as the hours passes by eat less and less. Avoid to drink your calories and avoid diry. Try to exercise by walking 20 min every day. And avoid sucker.
176138046,"In fact the Zyprexa suppresses my thinking in the evening… It literally shuts off my brain. And this is very painful mentally and even physically… I thought before its the illness, but nope, its the kick of the Zyprexa… Even my body is in pain, cause its not natural to have a brain on off position… Folks, is there a chance, that i’ll feel less this shutting off once I get really more alive and energetic in the day? When I recover on the negatives and once my brain gets used to be more ‘‘alive’’ again? But yeah, I have my doubts… This chemistry is too strong… It shuts off all my progress made in the day … Do you feel the same on Zyprexa? I wonder how you don’t feel it like this? I have another ill friend and its the same with her on Zyprexa… It shuts her off too for everything…"
176138047,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ Yes we will meet again soon, it will depend on her working hours. Apartently she was very ok. She seemed happy with the afternoon and so did I. Thank you !"
176138048,"Before I got sick I was a shy child fond of art, science, reading and nature. Got symptoms at 13 onwards (and my breakdown at 18) so I didn’t live much of my life beforehand."
176138049,I got diagnosed in my late teens for nearly twenties. I think I was about 19 when I first began feeling strange. By 22 I’d been hospitalized several times. I ended up in a mental institution for a little less than a year. At 27 to 28 I was off meds for around 18 months and was hospitalized again. On a plus note I joined the forum nearly 5 years ago pr around there. My suicidal thoughts have drastically reduced since I joined. I did lurk for about two years or so. I’d imagine there are a few people who do that.

176138053,It gets my goat these days that some people seem to think it’s open slather on people. It doesn’t matter your politic. If you don’t agree you just need to let it go and move on. This site is built on being civil and supportive and it saddens me that some here think it’s kosher to attack people here and gang up on them… It’s not the message that is important. Yeah some people leave themselves open to getting some abuse but it still is the same message. Be civil and supportive. Yes. Sometimes in the past I’ve been anything but but please. Let it go people. If you’ve nothing supportive to add then let the punters have their go and let that mods deal with it. Don’t get petty. NO one wins in petty squabbles and it really honestly pisses me off that you people behave like we’re in highschool… I’m 49 and know better. Do you?

But I’m glad I did. I didn’t know if the job would make or break me, as they say, but sometimes you just gotta take a leap of faith. I only get paid for the hours I work, so there’s motivation to not call in sick like I used to do half the time at my old jobs. I have to get up early, so I’ve had to make good routines."

176138064,"Sorry I’ve been gone from here for so long. My husband and I moved from a million+ city to a town of around 15,000 people(about 100 miles away). It’s easier to get around, and life is slower. The entire moving process(lasting about 3 months)has been super stressful. I’m still not all unpacked because of the seeming unending repairmen coming and going. Our home ended up being a fixer-upper due to the previous owners’ tenants trashing the place. The whole place had to be repainted, and one room had to be re-carpeted due to cat piss in the old rug. And the bathrooms were awful. But things are starting to get better now. Almost all the work has been done and there is an end in sight. When we bought this house we were able to get extra money from the sale of our other house. Good thing. Repairs aren’t free. We hire independent handymen. One guy is a vet who suffers from PTSD. He does good work; he’s just slower doing it but he charges by the job not hourly. I’m glad to be able to send work

I haven’t drunk this much since college and let’s be honest even then I didnt drink every day. I dont really know why. I have been under a lot of stress lately with school. I have also been having some PTSD issues. I just like the way the alcohol makes me feel, I like feeling detached from it all and not thinking about life. My boyfriend was worried for me and says he doesn’t want me to become an alcoholic. I’m scared I keep saying I’m going to cut back but it doesnt happen, same as with my food intake.

I would ramble and rant about all of my false memoriess, voices, and angels, I held sermons that they listened to, allowing them to ask questions along the way. This activity became a once a month event, with new people coming to experience my rantings at a drug fueled party. We made products to sell at a flea market to help support us. My “friends” would try to teach the “truth” to people. My right hand men called themselves “the piggies”. They were in charge of security and drug acquisition. We got raided by the DEA, and everyone scattered, we broke up shortly after that, and I moved back to California. Don’t do drugs, they aren’t worth it, specially for a SZ.

That’s a nice decrease! _AT_MENTION_ Cooked veggies are just as good as raw. I am not a fan of cooked as a rule, except for things like asparagus and brussels sprouts that you can’t eat raw. I can see why you would prefer them seasoned. I’m far from perfect, I avoid greens in salads even though I know they’re good for me, because then I need to make room for salad dressing calories. I don’t like the fat-free kinds, I like vinegar and grapeseed oil, or balsamic vinaigrette. Salad dressing is something I don’t compromise on, just like cheese (fat-free cheese is evil!). So I eat cauliflower, broccoli, cucumbers, snap peas, and tomatoes raw without dressing. I look forward to my 12 grape tomatoes in the afternoons! I do put greens in sandwiches when there are other flavors, but I know I could be doing better getting leafy greens. When I get to ma

I think the monkeys might lack the understanding that they’ll be out of those cells at some point (something a human could figure out). I’m sure it’s harder for people on the spectrum, but I don’t think it necessarily counts them out. I saw the first season of this show called Atypical about an autistic high schooler, a girl who had a crush on him starts dating him and takes into account all his mannerisms (many of which she finds honest and endearing) and tries to adapt so they can get along better.

You’re still pretty spacey after you smoke weed for the first time. One time when I was on Haldol decoate I smoked a couple of joints of kick ass weed with this guy. I got really stoned. It stayed with me the next day, not as strong, but still there. I thought the people on tv were messing with my mind. Personally, I never liked weed that much. I don’t like the high.

174377353,I got diagnosed in 2008 well 2010 really but it was always schizophrenia. I didn’t accept it until 2014 and that was a long six years. I think it’s pretty normal to not accept it. The delusions feel so real. I still have them. I figured out something was probably wrong with me in 2012 but still didn’t buy the schizophrenic story. In 2014 I got serious with my meds and maxed out my AP. I got stable in less than a year. Up until that point I was always trying to come off meds. Meds are my friend now. I take them religiously.

176138260,Why? I just dont understand. Why did I develop PTSD? It is said PTSD is caused by a real or perceived threat. A threat to you. The event that lead to my PTSD didnt happen to me. I witnessed two men beat a young woman a couple houses down from me. I was by my house they weren’t coming towards me. As far as I know they didnt threaten me. So why am I like this? Why am I still panicking sometimes? Why am I still having intrusive memories? Nothing happened to me. I was safe. I dont understand. I feel as though I dont even deserve to say I have PTSD. There are many people who have been through way worse.

176138272,No. I took clozapine. I will call my psychiatrist later and I will ask him
176138273,Surprisingly my children’s voices are silent- just the bad voices sending spiders occasionally.
176138274,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes, I’ve bought some new clothes. I went from squeezing into 3X’s to fitting at 2X. My pants size went from 26 to 22. I even got new underwear, because the previous ones started falling down! I got tired of hitching them back up again so I sprung for some new ones. I really liked four of the new tops I got in 2X so I bought them in 1X too so I have them at my long-term goal weight. I haven’t bought too much because I am still losing, so these will become too big too. But I am volunteering twice a week and searching for a full-time job. I have to look nice in the office. One thing I’ve noticed is that I can walk around the office without my cane. But I really should still use it, because I get really sore after a volunteering day. I like being normal though! I don’t like using my cane, really. I’ve had it for 12 years now (I have a collapsed disc in my lower back), but that doesn’t mean I like it!"
176138275,"I’m sorry to hear there are difficulties at home. I think speaking down to your parents is one of those tricky things. My parents used to have zero tolerance for me speaking up for myself and saw it as being disrespectful and rude. My Dad is still overly sensitive and its broken my trust with him completely because he’s too emotional and irrational to rely on for advice/support. I feel like they maybe your parents are not used to the idea that their children are adults now? Maybe its a similar thing where they don’t want to be talked down to even if you have justifiable reasons. My advice is to keep speaking, you will feel worse if you don’t. But just be careful of how you are speaking, because tone can greatly affect how people perceive your words. With your other post it seems like you are saying you feel quite alone and detached from them? All I can suggest is that maybe you approach them for support, specially if there are specific things that are bothering you."

176138288,That’s a good question _AT_MENTION_ I think with my psychosis it depends on what it contains as different things vary Off my meds I get voices almost every day. On meds they come about once a week or two. Voice attacks last about 10-15 mins at a time. Off meds - or on as well - my delusions are still there but the paranoia gets worse off meds So some of my psychosis lasts 10 mins and some lasts for years

I can’t discuss him without it being about how amazing and strong that she was. What about me? What about the fact that I helped him through the emotional part of his illness? What about the fact that I loved him too? People make me so goddamn angry. But none of that matters anyway, because I hate the person that this world pushes me to be. I have the strangest feeling of both being an absolute piece of shít and desperately wanting to feel something other than guilt."

176138299,Hey guys some one has some advice to loose weight?

I plan to burn around 5000kalories per week with the bicycle…! I know my methabolism is slowing down with antypsychotic but I think is possible loosing weight with a good diet and fitness…
176138300,It may take awhile to see if a med is going to work for you. They take a little while to build up in your system. It depends on the medicine how long. Your pdoc should be able to tell you how long. I would give it 3 weeks as a general rule.

176138302,"I’ve live a good amount of my life in the U.S. now. Right now I’d say Mexico is far more dangerous. I still love Mexico. There is almost always a war between drug cartels going on. It has been that way for the past 15 or so years. Some years have been more violent than others. This year has been pretty bad. It has a lot to do with famed druglord _NAME_ getting caught. It is often said that drug cartels in Mexico are like the Hydra, cut one head off and more grow back. That’s basically what is happening. Due to his capture, many cartels are fighting for territory and profits. The cartel he was head of has infighting going on as well to decide who will be its next leader. There was a report that _PERSON_’s compadre _NAME_ Mayo_PERSON_ has ordered hits on _PERSON_’s sons. _PERSON_ Mayo _PERSON_ is also reportedly a billionaire, the only difference is that he stayed away from the limelight so to speak. Many have speculated that he runs things behind the scenes. He is 71 years old but many exp
ect him to prevail as the head of the Sinaloa Cartel. Anyway, bloody battles happen often in Mexico. Just last month some cartel members burned down a rival cartel’s hangout. Over 23 people died in that bar. They’ve also decapitated people in videos while threatening other cartels. Really crazy things. Just last week a 16 year old kid who had been a hitman since 13 attempted to ambush some rivals (some of whom were police officers) and a gun battle ensued. It was brief and I believe 8 were reported dead. The 16 year old hitman had his head blown off."

174377381,No other benefits. They’re only made to fix positive symptoms of schizophrenia. If you took them its hard to stop them because you will have positive symptoms. Your brain adapts to them. I don’t know if its permanent. Maybe its permanent because street drugs can cause permanent schizophrenia.

176138371,"I have a huge existential approach to life, so don’t flag me please. It’s just my personal philosophy, not an edict from up on high. I think life is absurd, pointless, and exists in a vacuum. I even venture into nihilism where I think that if life becomes too much, it all becomes a question of are you brave enough to commit suicide and end this pointless and painful existence early. I think that’s ultimately what all existentialists ask themselves: am I brave enough to end this misery on my own terms?"

It feels kinda good but the voices say it’s the worse pain they have ever given cuz they say they have tortured every one after death and they say it’s all for smoking ciggs.

176138396,Even though I try not to believe in religious horse shite anymore. It’s more like “I will be great”. It’s tough to live with either way. That i have destiny from god to do anything. Feels nice to have free will. Thanks for putting it in perspective for me a bit tho. “Religious horse shite” lol. Why would the whole iop tell me I’m the chosen one. And when I told the lady at the beginning I had the delusion I was “the chosen one” she only looked at me and smiled. And later she said “you know what us Catholics think” and I laughed at that statement then the whole room laughed at my reaction. Then this guy said angrily “i never believed in god but If god is sitting right in front of me” and he pointed to me kinda. Maybe they were just playing off my coincidences and mental illness trying to make me miserable and stuff.
176138397,"I remember another aspect of my 3 month psychosis where I had the same ideas of reference. If you feel famous, there are worse things. But I felt infamous and notorious and smoked thinking it would please my enemies. To but me more time or something… It felt like duress and funny is I even started becoming kinder and kinder bc I thought I was part of some type of ‘Hunger Games’ where I had to entertain and be popular and well liked etc. Posing a question for you is how bad does the lack of privacy get for you. [I feared greatly for the safety of my own person.] Is that a piece of it? You don’t have to answer. Still personally _PERSON_ remember motivations of taking my life for logical reasons to avoid precisely what a sign I saw at a toll booth told me: it said: ‘depart slowly.’ These specifics are meant to pick you up and out of it. You don’t need to answer the questions I posed if you feel you’ll not benefit from it."

176138402,This morning when I went to volunteer work they were suppressing me and talking down at me and making me feel uncomfortable as I don’t believe I have superiors. Because I feel so uncomfortable around all of them now I am taking a break from volunteering. It’s not ok to treat me like that. I’m not ok with it. Maybe that’s why I don’t have friends. My “friends “ want me to be their bi tch they can boss about and suppress and when I’m not ok with it we can’t be friends. No one wants to be equal?not many and I am drawn to a touch of anarchy not overall but a nice touch with love not hate. I used to get discounts but will lose that now. I just don’t want to feel so uncomfortable and awful. Better I stay at home in bed and feel better. I volunteer worked a year there I think. It’s a Christian place and they seem to be power crazed and love bossing and ranks etc but that’s not my cup a tea or beliefs. I love my manager I had but the way she behaved today was not on. Hopefully I can 
stay at the other place I volunteer. Would be nice to have friends but I don’t know if I can have friends that think they are superior me. Could we agree to disagree… Better I be alone than be treated badly in any way. I was bullied when I was younger .called ugly every day and stupid and whore so that hurt me so much and now I don’t want to tolerate bad vibes even. I have difficulties being around people most of the time. I miss my x in sa.biggest regret leaving him n girls.

I’ve read reports that say GABA may cross the blood brain barrier. I’ve also heard it crosses the blood brain barrier in small amounts, and when it does it is removed much faster than it enters, so it may have negligible effects. I read when GABA is paired with L-theanine it can help quite a bit with sleep. I also read when GABA is paired with L-arginine it greatly increases the ability of GABA to cross the blood brain barrier. GABA may also effect the enteric nervous system. In the end there is a lot of conflicting information and reviews out there, all I can suggest is try it and see how it affects you. There really isn’t any definitive information that I could find."

174377405,"Abstract Results from the development of a novel sensory and perceptual test to assess the level of altered visual size perception in people with schizophrenia are presented. Here we compare the performances in a visual sensory and perceptual test between a control group and an experimental group of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. We have been using paintings by _NAME_ and _PERSON_ plates to assess images size perception. In this transversal, ex-post-fact and quasi-experimental study we show differences between EG (Experimental Group) and CG (Control Group). Schizophrenics in-patients as compared to controls perceived sizes about 1.3 fold greater than healthy volunteers (p=0.006), thus showing that size perception is altered in schizophrenia. Together with previous results, this particular sensory test for size perception seems to be a useful assessment tool to evaluate the degree and severity of psychotic symptoms in prodromal schizophrenic states, and neuropsychiatric patients in general. It 
may help prevent acute crisis with proper, and most likely, lower dosages of medication. https://psyarxiv.com/5aymb/"

I have come to be at peace with it(when it comes) and believe that (hopefully) my worst days are behind me with that. Maybe if we were living 200 years ago things wouldn’t be this way.

I don’t know ???? about mind control other than I believe and know I am a victim. I don’t care if it bothers or annoys people here. I’ve been through hell trying to get people to listen and that includes therapists, doctors, and other mental health people. It’s been hell. I’ve been taking meds for 9 years now. The best advice is educate yourself but please take your medication if you are sick and need to. I’ve been off and my delusions are amplified 10x. Most people including myself will never get the help they need in terms of validation and freedom in these matters. I have never got an answer or acceptance. I know something happened in college. I was normal before that. I thought about studying physics and electrical engineering to figure out stuff, but I just take my meds now and read other people
s experiences. The book I’m reading now is “Transformation in America” or something by _PERSON_. I’m on page 78. It’s about her Mk-Ultra monarch ‘experience’ and her recovery. So far there is plenty of photographic evidence and it convinces me and I’m way more open to it than most. People who were traumatized, tortured, and mind controlled can get false memories and can’t remember what happened before, during, and after. Feels like me. It’s just so hard to understand and believe. Was it aliens? Was it people pretending to be aliens? I don’t know. She and her child were saved by a former government employee that knew a lot about the mind and deprogramming ; something I never experienced or had. Fortunately, my case is much better and I am a man, but I’m still lucky to be alive and recovered so much. It’s better to be a man too. I’ve heard legitimate stories of government organizations having 10-50 years of technology before we even know or get it. What if that is a lie too and it
s even more years ahead? I thought about that. My problem is I think of everything and anything. I get really delusional because I am highly suggestible when it comes to reading other things, movies, tv shows, and internet."

176138601,"Don’t let the fears gain control, _AT_MENTION_ . It is possible to know fear without becoming frightened of it. Fear is an uncertainty about a non-existent future. Take it as a challenge. Your brain is going wild, using imagination to dream up worse situations because it is stuck in a fear feedback loop. You are letting your mental fears control your actions in the real world. I am sza and I used to make the same mistake too. If I were in your place now, I would ask myself: have I actually been hurt when I woke up from a nightmare after having one during sleep? are nightmares a threat to my body? in fact, have any dreams(positive/negative) ever harmed me? Try practicing light meditation next time you are in bed. When one of your fearful thoughts pop up, dont turn away from it. Experience it. Learn to know what the fear that is frightening you is like. Dont run away from it or let it take control. You can be stronger than that."

174377446,"Some people describe schizophrenia as a spiritual crisis but it is a physical bio-chemical disfunction of the brain as well. To my mind the spiritual comes first and gives rise to the physical, but this can run very deep. Trying to fix schizophrenia by trying to fix your spiritual life is a bit like trying to fix a broken arm by praying. I’m not saying it can’t be done, but it is easier and more practical to put it in plaster. On top of this, approaching spirituality unguided can lead to greater crisis, whilst finding the right guide who understands your particular condition can be difficult. So do people find their spiritual practice, if they do any at all, helpful or destabilizing? Everyone is different, schizophrenia is a loose catch all term, and what works for one person might not necessarily work for another, which is one of the reasons we all take different meds. What are some of the spiritual practices you have tried, what has worked and what hasn’t and why? Thank you."
176138625,"hi _AT_MENTION_ , I hear you, it’s hard. I eat heaps of chocolate when I haven’t been able to stick to my diet & exercise routine. Then I get back into healthy eating. On the whole, I’ve managed to maintain a stable weight for 6 months so I must have more times that are disciplined than times that are choccy-fuelled. I agree with _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ it’s best to take your meds consistently and just try in moderation to eat healthy & exercise a few times a week. I’m in my mid-40’s & research shows it’s better to exercise HIIT than long workouts for my age group. So I try to stick to that, get my heart rate up to improve overall fitness & cardio-vascular health. The single most motivating factor in my health & fitness regime? Latest blood test results: my ap’s have given me high cholesterol and too many nutrient deficiencies to mention. That scared the ???? out of me and got me motivated to eat right & exercise. I understand that meditation done properly has excellent benefi
ts to anxiety & a lot of physical health issues. I never could do it, I have such high anxiety that when I meditate I just tune into terror. If you don’t mind me asking, what’s your age-group? I understand if you’d prefer not to say, maintain more anonymity."

I did that five days ago and it is making a big difference in my appetite and in my sugar cravings. I’m no longer hungry all the time and I no longer have the intense sugar and cookie cravings that I used to have. All gone!!! And now, since I’m no longer eating half my caloric quota in sugar, I’m struggling to get enough calories in each day. What a difference it’s making. This is as revolutionary a change in my diet for me as when I quit taking in 100% of my fluids as diet pop, and started drinking water for a change."

I could chat with a lady I agisted of and it was lovely.she is so easy going and easy to talk to while others just aren’t n then it depends if they like you etc. I felt so much hate from a woman who works at my local Coles. I don’t know why she hates me but she hates me . You don’t have to be psychic to feel those hate vibes. I’m certainly not everyone’s cup of tea but why hate hate hate. Now I find it difficult shopping at Coles because of her n a few others there.

174377485,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Remission of Schizoaffective Disorder Using Homeopathic Medicine: 2 Case Reports. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Alternative therapies in health and medicine , Mar 2018 Context • Research on the schizophrenia spectrum is primarily focused on pharmaceutical interventions, although alternative treatments have been gaining increasing popularity in recent years because patients are seeking treatments that are effective and have reduced side effects. A significant body of evidence already exists supporting the effectiveness of homeopathy to treat a wide array of illnesses. Objective • The research team intended to demonstrate the need for using both alternative and conventional treatments to improve clinical outcomes in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Design • The research team performed 2 case studies. Setting • The study took place at _NAME_ Natural Health Center (Tempe, AZ, USA), an outpatient clinic where Dr _NAME_ worked as a naturopathic doctor from 2008 to 20
14. Participants • The participants were a 23-y-old female (case 1) and a 34-y-old female (case 2), both of whom had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder of the bipolar type. Intervention • Individualized homeopathic treatment was initiated for the 2 patients, who previously had received medication of atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Outcome Measures • A Likert scale was used to evaluate the intensity of each patient's symptoms at each follow-up, based on self-reporting, using a scale from 1 to 10, with a score of 10 being the highest. Results • During the course of treatment, both patients' symptoms normalized, and they regained their ability to hold jobs, attend school, and maintain healthy relationships with their families and partners while requiring fewer pharmaceutical interventions. Conclusions • The 2 current case reports demonstrate a successful integrative approach to the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. They illustrate the value of individualized homeopathic pre
scriptions with proper case management in the successful treatment of that disorder. Future large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies should investigate individualized homeopathic treatments for mental health concerns, because the diseases cause great economic and social burden. i live like 4 hours away from where one of the homeopathic doctor who did this study .im going to pay her a visit as soon as i get 500$ lol i cant stand medicine i think this is the hope that i needed . no one ruin my delusion lol what are your guys thoughts?"

And treatments, that explore this pathway."

Last night I was trying to sleep and every time the second I closed my eyes I had random thoughts pop up that I could almost hear? These thoughts or voices werent from me. I know they were technically. But I had no control over them. And it was like several different sounding voices saying really random stuff. Some of it was mean to me but mostly it was completely random. And it sounded like it came from different parts of my head. I’ve had it happen a lot before but never that loud that I couldnt sleep.

There is nothing wrong with that. It may be a bumpy road, but putting on loads of weight isn’t good for you either! I put on 35 kilos on Olanzapine!"

Respectively from left to right they are fire, earth, water and air. The five phases are based on solutions to the pentagram which as you know _PERSON_ proved could not be solved with radicals. Other functions are required and it can be done. The difference between four and five dimensional relativity is not just one of speed. In four dimensional relativity we have a right 3-triangle together with the hypotenuse that can either be rational or irrational, in five dimensional relativity, all the co-ordinates are irrational. This doesn’t help at all with solving the problem of binary physics but it does help with understanding the book. You can consider five dimensional relativity as made up of five non-sequiturs."

176138854,"I was sexually assaulted by a neighbor who was 4 years older than me when I was ten in a fish house. Before that he’d always show me his penis and he verbally and physically abused me. I thought that every kid had to go through that. Eventually my parents wised up and told it to stop hanging around me. Right after the rape he threw me into the wall, stooped to eye level, and said four words that I will never forget. It said, you tell you die. The memory came back to me two and 3\4 years ago. I’m 37 now. Did two years of solid weekly therapy which helped a lot. My dirt bag abuser still lives in the general area. -S"

176138856,"I agree that no one can tell you what your sexuality is. Everyone falls somewhere on the _NAME_ scale. That is a “sexuality” scale that says you can be straight, bi, or gay or anywhere “in between”. Its the “in between” that’s important. You might be neither gay nor straight but fall somewhere in the middle. My next suggestion is to work with a therapist and not a case worker to find out the answers to your questions. They may be able to help put your thoughts into perspective."

176138858,I think the warning about antipsychotics and dementia started with the introduction of 2nd generation a/p’s. There was no warning about 1st generation meds. They are issuing a warning on all new a/p meds that are approved without data showing the new med is in fact a risk. They are assuming there is a risk.

174377530,"Aripiprazole is now settled. Took about two weeks for my body to get used to it, as I found it mildly activating. But not as much as when I was on 30mg as my main Anti-Psychotic. Just need to see if it lowers prolactin, and when is best to have a blood test to determine effectiveness Currently things are stable. I am hesitant to mess with any doses – especially Diazepam , for the moment, as I’d argue that we have come down from 30mg to 10mg and I need a breather from reducing this medication. Maybe if we can agree to try and cut that one out in the new year? Not sure if I need Procyclidine . I have reduced the dose of this from 25mg p/d to 5mg in the morning and at lunchtime. My mother _NAME_ says she can notice if I have not taken it, so unsure. Last I was physically checked was for cogwheel rigidity and Dr _PERSON_ said that I needed this medication – that was over a year ago now I think? Amisulpride reduction I made was too much, and I needed to be able to work, and it was a close-run thin
g with me feeling so rotten from the 200mg drop and weighing up my ability to work. Can we decide on whether we need to reduce this under the proviso that we need to take this action if we’re not satisfied with the reduction in prolactin from the Aripiprazole? Pregabalin I am not certain I need. That said I have not had crippling anxiety now since going on 300mg per day. As I understand we can go as high as 600mg p/d, but I am happy to keep at the same level as it seems to be effective. I would just like to know whether now we have pharmacologically proven that the anxiety issue is broadly dealt with using this medication, whether I will get an additional anxiety-related diagnosis, as I feel this would be useful for anyone I deal with medically can be aware of as a structured thing. I am just a bit confused as to the treatment of this, as I am medicated for something I am not diagnosed with? Thoughts? Autism has proven to be a very difficult diagnosis to adjust to. I don’t think I have been supported at a
ll by the Trust on this, and the charity organisations that Dr _PERSON_ directed me too are unable to help me due to high demand and Covid etc…. My stress levels and anxieties around social interactions have gotten much worse than they were before, as now I have a working understanding of Autism, when I make mistakes socially and with other people, I am currently noticing them in real time, but I have no coping mechanisms to deal with this. Therapy is responsible for me getting this ASD diagnosis, but now that has been ended I was left with a self-help book and the internet for answers. All I want is to be able to anticipate my shortfalls in social situations before they happen, rather than immediately afterwards. This is especially important now I am self-employed and dealing with customers directly, and trying to secure my income for the future. Obviously this has potential to compromise progress away from social exclusion/isolation from the local community. Sleep – I always get asked how this is going. 
I now sleep 5-6 hours instead of 8-10. I prefer things this way. I think the mild activation from the Aripiprazole is doing this"

176138941,"It’s a trigger word for sure. If you tell it to the wrong person you could really screw up your life in a heart beat. Therapists and psychiatrists are obligated to tell the police if they think someone is really capable of murdering someone. I was frustrated and mad years ago and told a therapist I wanted to kill someone. Of course I had no intention of doing so, but I was really mad. Luckily the therapist knew me well enough to know I would never do such a thing but he called both my sisters and told them how dangerous it is to say that. Me and him had to have a conversation about it and he told me with any other client, he would have reported me to the head psychiatrist and he probably would have told the police but he trusted me enough to just let me off with just a warning. After we settled that, than I had to face my sisters and they warned me how lucky I was to not be reported to the police. I’ve never said it since and I never really wanted to kill anyone anyways."
176138942,I’m not really offended by these phrases. I think it’s more a reflection of the person’s ignorance than anything else. Remember when the “cute but psycho” t-shirts came out? Thought the same thing about those.

I have family working from 7.30am to 9pm who are happy with me despite that I am not working.she even thought/thinks I should be on the pension but she thinks I should volunteer. When people ask I have started saying I’m on the pension. It’s not nice saying that but I’ll get used to it. My x boyfriend used to tell people he is on the pension.no sham
e in it. So I started telling people that too. Society can be angry at you for not being more productive but they don’t know me then. I feel encouraged and praised for the little good I do and that makes me improve and do even more. In Sweden they hated on me and that made me isolate and not go out sober etc They were like you don’t deserve food because you don’t work much etc but did that make me work more?no it made me work less because of the hate I was getting. I am happy to be on the pension. It helps me. I’m grateful for it.

While whole chunks of his work have been superseded by later developments (as it is the case with most major thinkers and scientists) his biological reductionism, by and large, has stood its ground. Biological reductionism (even in its most sophisticated forms) remains an unpalatable truth to many, who will try to sugarcoat the pill with all manner of fanciful inventions, from free will, to quantum consciousness. All _PERSON_ is truly guilty of is trying to dispel some of our most cherished illusions."
176138966,I use notepad on my phone and pc. Data is synced on Microsoft and Google servers linked to my email. Its awesome.
176138967,"It was really hard doing anything when i stayed with my parents, my dad was ok but my mum was a bit frustrated that i wasn’t doing as much as she wanted, i tried my best but when i was really paranoid going out to the local shop down the hill was really scary, i was lucky i had our dog to take out, he was a good dog and made me feel safer when out. I remember thinking everyone was out to get me."
174377541,Meds like Vraylar and Abilify are partial dopamine agonists at D2 receptors while other AP’s are antagonists. I get how the antagonists reduce positive symptoms by reducing dopamine but the partial agonists perplex me. If they are activating your receptors how do they reduce hallucinations? And does that mean they won’t make negative symptoms as bad?

176138969,"I’m so sorry. Here’s a joke for you. A bear was chasing a rabbit through the forest, when they ran into a forest spirit. The spirit said they could have three wishes each, and they agreed to take turns. The bear went first. “I wish all the bears in the forest were female”, he said. The spirit granted his wish. The rabbit asked for a “really fast motorbike”. The bear and the spirit found it odd, but the rabbit got his bike. The bear had a think, and wished all the beard in the country were female. The rabbit asked for a helmet. For their finals wishes, the bear said "" you know what, I want all the bears in the WORLD to be female!"" He grinned and clapped his paws as the spirit confirmed his wish was granted. The rabbit put on his helmet, started the bike, and took off while yelling "" I wish the bear was gaaaaaay!"""

176138974,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m not really artistic either. But I’m trying to learn. I dont like drawing on paper cos fixing mistakes is not easy. But with an app you can just hit the Undo button! No pressure though. Here’s a pic of a flower I _NAME_ from imagination. I try not to use reference images and I draw with a mouse. While a study buddy would be nice, I’m just happy having you and the other folks on this forum as plain _NAME_ buddies cos I’m so lonely. I live in a state in India where I dont speak the language, there’s nothing near, none of my buddies even email me anymore, I’m not allowed to use the phone and my family refuses to talk about my sz. _AT_MENTION_ You have studied theology academically? I’ve done it more as a hobby. I come from a Christian family but my folks let me choose my own path as an youth. They refuse to discuss the topic with me now since they believe it triggers my sz. Yet I’ve found paths like Taoism extremely useful in dealing with my sz. I tried reading the Ko
ran but found it too filled with hate. The first surah even had a bit where it said that god has closed the eyes of unbelievers and they will be be punished for it! But it also talks a lot about Jesus while the Bible doesnt even mention _NAME_. I find the Bible New Testament a good book but the Old Testament is filled with a lot of hate and the beginning 5 books are just a copy of the Torah. Atheists are rarely able to attack the New Testament. I believe the _NAME_ Bible by _NAME_ is a better version to follow."
176138975,"I’m feeling school, occupational, and life burnout. I don’t know. Nothing interests me and nothing motivates me or heals me. I often fantasize about going back to college and majoing in CS or CE at a local or online school and working as a computer repair guy or technician like on bitcoin ATMS or just designing and building them. I would like to make a better one or design asic chips or something. I don’t really have the ability, capacity, and interest or desire to do web design or learn 100 frameworks/languages to make good money. I rather just learn c/c++ and a couple other languages and do that. Math interests me too and I have math books but math leads nowhere really. I just want a job and income coming through to me so I can invest in bitcoin or other cool investments and become wealthy."

176138979,I think for us Sz the best part for having a job is getting out the house regularly. A good relationship at the workplace comes the second. And then a decent pay is a bonus.
176138980,I finally got approved for disability and it was such a relief and I felt initially that I would be able to take steps to work on improving my quality of life. And then I started thinking about how I will have to be re-evaluated in 24 months. Now I feel like I should not be out and about because the government might take away my benefits. My dr asked me if I drive. I’m afraid to even on days when I have no hallucinations. I feel trapped

I’m staying indoors all the time in my dark, dreary little apartment when I could be out enjoying life. Like traveling to all the destinations where I want to go. Like New England, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Israel. And I would like to visit England and Germany again. I could be out taking myself to restaurants here in town. I could be renting movies and watching them. I could be asking my hairdresser out on a date. I could be going on senior dating sites. I could be going to museums and art galleries. I could be taking myself to movie theatres. Starting tomorrow, I could be swimming in my apartment outdoor pool."
176138987,"Another complex tactile I’ve experienced is them trying to mimic the sound of my heartbeat and try to trick me into thinking they could raise my blood pressure and increase my actual pulse. I did a little research on it, I think it’s called a prepulse inhibition. They say it’s acoustic and tactile stimuli. Whatever. My brain automatically reminds me to remain calm. Allowing fear and anxiety would do nothing but really raise my blood pressure. It is a scary experience, especially when my skin turns red and I start sweating."

176139004,"I think I may have. I know we’re not supposed to feed into each other’s delusions so I’ll refrain from sharing too much. The thing is three of the times I’ve experienced such a phenomenon, I was with other people and they saw the same thing. About two years ago I was talking with someone about it and we both agreed with our diagnosis, no one would believe our stories. All three times I was with different people and there were at least two others who saw the same thing. Weird stuff."

174377551,It used to be the case the nurses came to the house to give the depot. But due to staff shortages you have to go to the health centre. It is in the next town from me. Thing is my positive symptoms make it really hard for me to get to clinic. My parents have obligations elsewhere so they can’t take me. No friends to help. I am kinda so desperate that I want my doc to prescribe oral fluanxol instead of the depot
176139017,i also have little chance with women its not that im ugly its just that my poverty of speech is strong. im in my 20s and i dont think ill ever get married at this rate. i like how you say deny myself of pleasure i think you are right about that.

176139022,_AT_MENTION_ what’s up?
176139023,Can’t expect wonders out of all of us. Fear doesn’t make a very good motivator.
176139024,3 days in usually the addiction part. The rest is habits and the brain. It’s tough. I got off on champix/chantix or whatever it’s called in your neck of the worlds. It went really well for me and never looked back. It’s tough to do it cold turkey. It really is an insidious drug. Withdrawal is something that you can’t really avoid…Dont’ be hard on yourself. If you can’t do it slowly titrate down on the cigs. Try the chems to help. Sorry your suffering but giving up is so good for you.
176139025,"_AT_MENTION_ The night before, trying writing down a list of what you want to do the next day (doesnt have to be productive) The next day just try to do at LEAST one thing that you wrote down the day before. You don’t have to do it fully, just try. Hope this helps."

176139029,"_AT_MENTION_ Hey Friend. I know the struggle. It’s really hard. And we want so much more out of life! I know you want to be there for your daughter. You are not an idiot. You are longing, and you want that longing to be met. Unfortunately, because of this illness, you need a different way to meet that longing than not telling anyone and not showing up. You do have a say in your meds, as you should. But you don’t communicate that you are rational, reasoned, and informed by just not showing up. Can you make an appointment with your psychiatrist and explain why you aren’t getting the injection? Can you at least call and leave a message for him/her or write him/her an email?"
176139030,I had erotomania off meds. I thought stranger girls were in love with me. I even thought that I needed to kill myself bcz my bride is waiting for me in heaven.

176139037,thats fantastic can only get better fro m here sounds like your in remission
176139038,I wouldn’t go to an ER room. The bill for that could be quite high. I would go to an urgent care and explain your situation.
176139039,How much did you take? Did it make you psychotic or made your positive symptoms worse?

176139045,_AT_MENTION_ I wouldnt really say I’m a good human being though. I’m not evil just not great either. _AT_MENTION_ Its nice to hear I’m not the only one. I know that I’m not but confirmation is nice. I wish he wouldnt have to go through that. I would rather live with this and have nobody understand if that means nobody else would have to go through it. It sucks and I dont wish it upon anybody.
176139046,I wasn’t allowed to have my phone in the ward or use a computer. I guess you have a better facility then I did!
176139047,"I’d say go to the drs then. If you have symptoms like this, particularly the neck issue, it could’ve have been a heart problem."

I went from extreme muscle spasms all the way to fainting and losing vision. So I hope that I don’t have to go through more of that if Latuda fails me. How’s _PERSON_ been for you? I don’t think I’ve been on it, but its been a while since I’ve had to keep track of that."
176139051,I stopped xanax suddenly after a couple of years of 2-3mgs per day. Had a gran mal. That really sorted out things for me. I titrated slowly off them and been better for it. Great for short acting anxiety. Terrible for tolerance and increased dosage.

176139062,Time for meds. Yeah I take three in the am.

174377561,So interesting! I like that psychiatrist.
176139073,Well…it would be really bad to be part of satans minions and do really evil stuff i dont think i would never have piece of mind hearing people commenting on my thoughts and telling me horrible things and listening to people getting tortured 24/7 so no.
176139074,Yesterday Went to the gym and attended the whole time despite feeling feelings of hopelessness and depression (may not have been me I was feeling but a closest)anyway I didn’t walk out but managed to stay and do exercise despite not feeling so well. Bought vegan chocolate and some coffee and had a fruit salad which was luxurious.and delicious. Did volunteer work with ladies I really love/like and even had a bit of a chat and they are so patient with me when I keep forgetting how to do a simple task they keep showing me over and over again.such patience.

I myself was in deep grief over my divorce (I know, it makes zero sense), from 1991 to 2005, when I fell out of love with my ex, and found God in the same year. It was during those 14 years that I was constantly struggling with suicidal thinking and even attempted suicide twice. But in 2005 several things happened. My father apologized to me over the phone for his incest of me. He explained that he knew he had a problem but couldn’t stop and there was no help available back then. Of course I accepted his apology. Also, I saw my ex for what he truly was. Just a regular man. Nothing special. In addition, I became confirmed and this improved my life overwhelmingly. Also, my pdoc started me on the mood stabilizer Tegretol, which I’m no longer on."
176139084,"Yes. I eventually became more psychotic, and still have delusional moments, especially in response to trauma-things. I use an AP, but in a much lower than usual dose. I have loads and loads of anxiety too, so the AP also helps against that as well."

Just to highlight that our brain is capable of stuff like that where our perceptions are changed like that, whether it be in dreaming or psychosis. _AT_MENTION_ 100% Believing it to be 'real’instead of an illness might add fuel to the fire: keeping an open mind that this might be a disease ( that could possibly be treated) might help u keep some insight and might therefore prevent the extent of psychosis getting more full blown.

176139176,I think the safest mode of thinking is direct realism. Using only reason and facts is the best way to fight delusions if it is possible. Thinking you are in a simulation is somewhat based on reasoning namely analogical reasoning when you compare video games to real life for instance but it takes away your ability reason about the world directly in a way akin to indirect realism because you convince yourself you are only seeing a representation or copy of the world in your mind and your interpretation that it is a simulation becomes real. I think for sz indirect realism leads to a detachment from reality. You have to stay grounded and not convince yourself that the world is something other than it is perceived. Believing in simulation based on an analogy you perceive creates a false equivocation and the analogy takes place of the real. What harm could it do. You could begin to think that the simulation is beyond your control and develop learned helplessness or external locus of control. You could sta
rt to think life doesnt matter because its fake. Or you could develop a delusion that you are an immortal simulation. The list goes on.

176139269,"There are mainly two kinds of OCD the usual one (serotonin deficient) and the other is (dopamine deficient). If take SSRI the usual one resolves but if the case is due to low dopamine like in AP induced, parkinson based then SSRI is of no use. May be dopamine improving drugs might help. I also have dopamine deficient OCD and I find CDP choline useful. It helps to increase dopamine receptor density thus improving dopamine levels indirectly. Also it have a slight effect on norepinephrine levels. Technically all dopamine improving drugs will help it but some give side effects like insomnia, increased heart rate etc. CDP choline in low dose is a suitable option as it not stimulate like that of other dopamine boosting drugs. Ask your doctor if you can take CDP choline in low dose."

Like I go a long while not feeling guilty about really anything but then it hits me like a ton of bricks and I feel like the worst person alive. I do when I experience the waves of guilt. Like I think about all the things that I probably should feel guilty about but don’t, and that results in guilt. I first noticed it when my grandpa died and everyone else in the family felt guilty about something or other and I didn’t. Like it got to the point where they called me out on it because they thought I was internalizing it or whatever. I was sad and angry that my grandpa was dead, but not guilty. I do feel guilty about some things like hurting people and a sort of situational guilt about living in the U
S when there are people suffering throughout the world so that I can live the life I lead. Well no, I do worry about being a bad person because of this stuff and my lack of emotional depth. Like, I know I’d never like murder anyone, but if I did I don’t know how I’d feel about it. Like I feel like I try and force guilt onto myself just so I know I can feel it, and that I’m not completely evil, you know? Like I imagine myself in these scenarios in which I think I would feel guilty and pretend I’m there, just to prove to myself that I have a conscience. That said, I don’t really have much emotional depth. I feel excitement, agitation, frustration, anger, and guilt. Nothing else really, at least that I can identify."
176139314,"March 11, 1996 A Prospective Study of Coffee Drinking and Suicide in Women _PERSON_, MD; _NAME_, MD; _NAME_ A_PERSON_, MD; et _PERSON_, MD; _NAME_, MD Author Affiliations _NAME_ Intern Med. 1996;156(5):521-525. doi:10.1001/archinte.1996._PHONE_NO_ Abstract Background: Among the many reported central nervous system effects of long-term caffeine use is improvement in mood. Objective: To examine prospectively the relationship of coffee and caffeine intake to risk of death from suicide. Methods: We conducted a 10-year follow-up study (1980 to 1990) in an ongoing cohort of 86 626 US female registered nurses aged 34 to 59 years in 1980, who were free of diagnosed coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer. Information on coffee and caffeine intake was collected by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire in 1980. Deaths from suicide were determined by physician review of death certificates. Results: Fifty-six cases of suicide occurred during 832 704 person-years of observation. Compared with non-dr
inkers of coffee, the age-adjusted relative risk of suicide in women who consumed two to three cups per day was 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 0.68) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86) in women who consumed four or more cups per day ( P for linear trend=.002). These findings remained essentially unchanged after adjusting for a broad range of potential confounding factors, including smoking habit, alcohol intake, medication use (diazepam and phenothiazine), history of comorbid disease (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes), marital status, and self-reported stress. A strong inverse relationship was similarly found for caffeine intake from all sources and risk of suicide. Conclusions: The data suggest a strong inverse association between coffee intake and risk of suicide. Whether regular intake of coffee or caffeine has clinically significant effects on the maintenance of affect or the prevention of depression merits further investigation in clinical trials and population-based prospective s

174377639,"In my youth I had very few social dates with different women. One reason was because my career was more important. So then when I met a woman who showed honest love for me I became overwhelmed. Then at one time she looked at me with a look of total love, with “passion.” I had never experienced this before. But actually she was married and it turned out that she did not intend to date me. This occurred at the start of my schizophrenia. I felt she was my “soul mate,” and my voices told me she would be an ideal partner for me, and to dream of her. I had a code word for her and I was told several times a day “soon you will be with her.” The voices never defined “soon.” So I pursued her by telephone for about 6 months. Then she married someone new, changed her name, and I lost track of her. But for about 30 years the delusion persisted that she was my “soul mate.” Now I see this had nothing to do with reality. You have to have sensible reasons for loving someone. The dream of this wo
man kept alive my dream of a romantic partner, and served to encourage me when I was very sick. But the idea of a “soul mate” was not valid."
174377624,Some of the anti-psychotics are better than others when it comes to cognition. However sometimes you trade cognition for anxiety or poor stress management. It can be a mixed bag. I got a DNA test a couple of weeks ago that will tell the pdoc which medications I am likely to respond to and which I will metabolise faster. Interesting stuff.

I’m just the janitor and some people appreciate us and some don’t. I’ve been on this site for many years now and people are bringing up incidents or things I’ve shared over the course of 10 years. Severals small incidents over 
the course of 10 years. If you think I should be perfect find one woman on here that I’ve been inappropriate with. Look at the big picture before you bring up just a few bad incidents. And the same goes for my sisters friends. I’m sorry if I judge people and situations wrong. Last time I checked, I have schizophrenia. And what does schizophrenia do to a person? It makes the majority of us misread social cues and be fearful."

176139340,I’ve been talking to this chick for two months now. I think I have the potential to love her maybe one day. I’m kinda scared to meet her because I don’t wanna ruin a good thing (our texting relationship). I became interested in her for reasons I wouldn’t be interested in her anymore. But many other reasons have sparked up since then as reasons why I like her. I definitely like her for her. And there’s no rush for me. I think if I didn’t meet her till 2020 it’d be an okay thing. Obviously gotta meet her eventually but I’m in no rush just a texting relationship.

If I could work within my limits, and not get cut off, I probably would have given it a try years ago. Unfortunately, under Insurance legislation, the minute I try to return to work I lose everything. So if I worked under the table, I would feel like a scammer. If I tell them about it, I lose all support ??????? pisses me off, because it has kept me bound. I’ve done a lot of volunteer work, but it’s not the same as the satisfaction of working"

They also gave me ambien for sleep, but it made me feel really weird so I quit taking it. It’s also worth mentioning that I eat THC edibles at night and I feel like that makes the most difference. But of course I can’t recommend anyone else try that because THC can be dangerous for others. So don’t do that, I guess."

And she just got done telling me, on the phone, that she doesn’t like me referring to her as my gf. I have long known that she doesn’t want to marry me or live with me. How could I have been so blind? She has been hanging out with me for some unknown, mysterious reason that she can’t explain apparently. I know because I asked her point blank for the reason. Unfortunately, the reason just might be money. Every once in a while, I give her a little gas money or pay for part of the groceries and things like that. She is always broke and appreciates the help. So, I guess I’ve been a fool."

The one pill I popped left me so stoned I couldn’t remember how to log into my Zoom AA meeting that night and I was chairing, so that was embarrassing. Bloody amazing.

174377661,"When I first met her. I was fresh out of the ward, on risperidone, a low dose. And a brand new diagnosis of MDD with psychotic features. I filled her in on my mental problems that I’d suffered with for years self medicating myself. I increased my risperidone to 5mg. She proceeds to diagnose me with schizophrenia. Still having voices but maybe 50% controlled. I was still getting depressed mood swings so I talked to her about a mood stabilizer. She said yes. So I went on lamictal, helps a lot with the depression. She wanted me to get a second opinion, and wanted me to change therapists. I went to PHP/IOP, they diagnosed me with SZA depressive. Which I think fits me. No med changes Gained some weight and she took me down on risperidone, I told her about latuda, she agreed, then geodon, she agreed. Had me on all three at once. Way too drugged up. She decided to change my diagnosis to psychosis NOS, but will only tell me she doesn’t know, that she only knows I’m mentally ill. The 3mg lowered rispe
ridone has left me with the crowd picking on me almost every day. So I decided on 10-15mg of abilify as an add On, she didn’t really give me more than a “ok, sounds good”"

In a way it was a blessing the shrink saw me psychotic and in relapse - cos i was finally taken seriously and the dreaded EUPD dx got questioned. I managed to stay out of hospital tho, and slept for a week whilst they weaned me onto risperadone. Christ - it was like having the flu when i first went on it. Will never come off the meds.

I’ve told my pdocs about it consistently but they don’t really give a ???? imo. I’m just a lifetime consumer. They’ll keep on gaslighting you into complacence if you let them when dealing with side effects. Placebo effect works 50% of the time right?

Cognition , Jun 2020 Deficits in cognition, social cognition, and motivation are significant predictors of poor functional outcomes in schizophrenia. Evidence of durable benefit following social cognitive training is limited. We previously reported the effects of 70 h of targeted cognitive training supplemented with social cognitive exercises (TCT + SCT) verses targeted cognitive training alone (TCT). Here, we report the effects six months after training.111 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were randomly assigned to TCT + SCT or TCT-only. Six months after training, thirty-four subjects (18 TCT + SCT, 16 TCT-only) were assessed on cognition, social cognition, reward processing, symptoms, and functioning. Intent to t
reat analyses was used to test the durability of gains, and the association of gains with improvements in functioning and reward processing were tested.Both groups showed durable improvements in multiple cognitive domains, symptoms, and functional capacity. Gains in global cognition were significantly associated with gains in functional capacity. In the TCT + SCT group, participants showed durable improvements in prosody identification and reward processing, relative to the TCT-only group. Gains in reward processing in the TCT + SCT group were significantly associated with improvements in social functioning.Both TCT + SCT and TCT-only result in durable improvements in cognition, symptoms, and functional capacity six months post-intervention. Supplementing TCT with social cognitive training offers greater and enduring benefits in prosody identification and reward processing. These results suggest that novel cognitive training approaches that integrate social cognitive exercises may lead to greater improvements 
in reward processing and functioning in individuals with schizophrenia."

174377693,"The simulators could simulate your mind and your perceptions so you cannot really tell, I guess, from what I read on wikipedia. So they could trick you. Instead of trying to use your perception (I think therefore, I am) why not look into physics like string theory or m theory or the plank scale or quasars/cosmic rays and find a lower or upper limit to the resolution of the sim? You could use math and physics to determine if you’re schizophrenic/delusional or not. Unfortunately, it will probably increase your symptoms and convince you are dreaming/right about whatever you think you’re right about… I am really into simulation theory and it used to bother me a few years ago every day, but then I realized like some other people it doesn’t matter to me. I don’t care anymore about simulation theory. Who runs it? Probably good and bad actors. There’s a saying if we find out they might destroy or reboot or reset us or even if we tried to escape the simulation. I don’t know. Personally, I thin
k it’s bad if we find out because of mental illness and mass psychological/ideological/perceptive issues. Maybe not, but I suffered immensley in agony due to dissociation/dp/dr for years and had moderate solipsism and it reinforced and created scary delusions and worsened my schizophrenia."

I didn’t know why that was until I waited on someone from England who was a server and they told me tipping is different there and they got paid more an hour or tipping was automatically included in the bill. Things are different now whereas they are more aware of the American tipping policy. Well, I say that but it could be that before I was a server (waiter) at like an Applebee’s or an Outback Steakhouse, but when I moved up to fine dining I never got less then 18% and that was rare. 20% was pretty much average. One time I waited on a group of men that came from the casino and they tipped me $1000 casino chip on a $200 bill. I was in shock. Another time some men came from the casino in a limousine and and they each gave me $100, there were 7 of them. I was a very good server.

I had it in my mind that they’d study human sound without the use of technology.)

In my case the only problems I find is that they symptoms are inconsistent. They change all the time. Day by day, week to week and month to month. Depending on what is transpiring, My symptoms are at the lower end of the scale but in the presence of stress they are higher. It is important to highlight here that I am not just referring to positive symptoms but negative and cognitive.

174377723,"Hi, I’m new here. I’ve been really struggling with my mental health the past, well, 3 years, but it’s gotten unbearable the past several months, once the thought broadcasting started. I’ve never been formally diagnosed with Schizophrenia, but I have pretty much every symptom so I’m not sure why my doctor hasn’t made an actual diagnosis yet, but that’s not the important part. I’m currently taking 80mg Latuda and have started seeing a psychiatrist regularly. My delusion is literally starting to ruin my life… I’ll try to explain the delusion the best I can… Basically, I believe or am paranoid that my boyfriend has been cheating on me for the entire almost 4 years of our relationship with his ex-gf (who he was still with when he met me, but she broke up with him when she found out about me)…note that this girl does not (to my knowledge) actually exist, and my bf and his family denies knowing who I’m talking about, it’s all just a delusion. Anyways, this girl HATES me and has 
been trying to break us up for years and has spread the most vicious lies about me and turned everyone she meets against me. The hallucinations started after I had my daughter three years ago…I started thinking I could hear her and her roommates and my boyfriend talking in my head. It progressed to become daily, then 24/7, even if my bf wasn’t there, I still heard her talking about me all the time…and they have hidden cameras all around my house and are watching me making fun of me all the time. Several months ago, the girl and I somehow became telepathically connected and she can now read my thoughts, and see what I see. Now, her roommate has also been able to do the same. I don’t get a break, they torment me 24/7, interrogate me on things I’ve never done and accuse me of lying about being raped, and they are absolutely horrible to me. From the second I wake up to the second I fall asleep, they’re harassing me. I need it to stop. Has anyone had a similar experience? I know I sound completely off 
the charts insane. They are command voices too, and tell me they won’t stop until I kill myself. They’re reading everything I write now even, and are judging me and making fun of me. My self esteem has hit rock bottom, and they fat shame me all day telling me how ugly I am. I’m so stressed out, my blood pressure has increased from 110/70 ish to 136/84. I’m scared to even think. Everything I think gets misinterpreted or used against me or I get called a liar…my mental capacity is diminishing. I’m still in college and an a student, but I had to drop two classes and everything I do with school, they’re criticizing me and making me doubt myself. I’m scared I will have to drop out again. I just need the voices to stop."

I also notice I panic when I have to start a really stupid basic task, like cleaning the dishes or sorting out papers. As soon as it has gotten too big (a week of dishes for example) I don’t have an overview, so I feel panicky and fearful and uncomfortable when I try to start. No clue why. But that leads me to avoid it. Until a bigger fear comes along that overrides the first fear! I just realise. Like being rejected by people."

It all sounds like a delusion but there was certain information from them that I could not have possibly known such as _NAME_ mentioning his new show called The Second Coming, a show that didn’t come out until a year later. Of course it could all have been a wind up and only one person was there orchestrating the whole thing."

174377751,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ Often my mental conversations are about conversations I have had or am going to have. Sometimes they are stressful. But often they are about explaining things to my pdoc, it’s like a rehearsal. Often though it’s just a mundane idea that I’m explaining to some random person in a loop. Whatever I’m thinking about at the time. Like a Socratic dialog. When I’m well I don’t think in sentences and they don’t repeat. It must be horrible for you to have intense bad emotion attached to this. I’m sorry to hear this. For me it’s mainly just annoying, boring and hard to get to sleep. I’ve found moving to Abilify has helped, but it still creeps in every now and then. The only thing I’ve found reading about thought disorder is that it’s kind of like thought echo, only it’s going on in my mind. I usually don’t say it aloud.

176139800,"Hi all, thought of sharing this information with you all who struggle to get good night sleep for various reasons. Phosphatidylserine is a natural food supplement which have various benefits and most useful one is it reduces cortisol, the stress hormone and due to that it can give deep restful sleep at night. Cortisol lowering helps in workout and muscle recovery too. Phosphatidylserine is very good for improving memory. In fact its the only food supplement approved by FDA for improving memory. Its very useful for lowering anxiety and thus useful in all anxiety related issues like general anxiety, social anxiety, OCD, depression etc. Its one of the best natural antidepressant too without causing memory problems like SSRI, serotonin based antidepressants. Phosphatidylserine comes in two forms, soy based and soy free (sunflower based). Its best to take soy free version and its more useful for improving sleep quality when compared with soy version. It can be bought from online sites like amazon and va
rious food supplements companies sell it. Jarrow, Now Foods, Swanson etc are few top brands to choose from. It can be taken either morning or at night and it doesn’t cause drowsiness like sleep pills and you can notice the effect on sleep after the first dose itself. Regards."

I know other people don’t have the handicap. I see other people doing stuff that I can’t do. But I don’t understand the mechanism, or how they’re accomplishing what they do. It’s like a complete black box mystery to me. I have a question for you. I heard that _NAME_ (presidential candidate here in the states) used to be a special education teacher. Do you think it’s possible for someone like me, a sza, to be a special education teacher? I do have a bachelors degree. Or would that be like the blind leading the blind?"

Now I resided to watch youtube gameplay videos that lasts up to 20 mins, it’s perfect cause it is not much talking here and if it is it is easy to understand and I can finish my meal by the time video ends."
174377777,"I usually make points. That is the best way to explain. All of these medications have about the same efficacy at average except Clozapine. There is no such thing as a good medication. You have to see what works best for you. Abilify is the least heavy on side effects, though. Once Clozapine is optimized, you may try reducing Haldol “slightly” and increasing the “Abilify” slightly just to re-check whether which medication works best for you. My experience is based on 9 years of trial and error (between them terrible doctors and finally a correct fit). Your experience is lesser. Therefore, I give some advise based on my experience. You just have to give your symptoms. Tell him the narrative too, that you think he is involved in it. This is to give him a good sense of the intensity of the episode, so that he adjusts the medications accordingly."

176139824,"Well everyone uses a different assessment. Some doctors tend not even talk about any side effects, some not even about your delusions.

174377809,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Abnormal Bodily Phenomena in First Episode Psychosis: A Preliminary Exploratory Cohort Study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychopathology, May 2020 06 Schizophrenia patients frequently display an array of abnormal bodily phenomena (ABPs). There is literature to suggest that the presence of ABPs may be representative of a fundamental disruption of the embodied and prereflexive state of selfhood and hence be relevant for the development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. ABPs have been considered as trait features of vulnerability to psychosis and may have value as potential markers for early detection, target symptoms for prevention and predictors of clinical outcomes. This longitudinal cohort study aimed to explore: (1) the prevalence of ABPs in first episode psychosis, (2) their longitudinal stability, (3) how ABPs compare with data from patients with enduring psychosis, and (4) how aspects of disorders of self-experience (DSEs) and 
ABPs and the corresponding instruments relate to each other. Sixteen patients were recruited from an early intervention in psychosis service. They were assessed with a series of structured and semi-structured interviews at point of entry, after 6 months and 12 months of follow-up. A variety of ABPs and DSEs were displayed in all study subjects, associated with high levels of core psychotic symptoms and reduced with treatment over time. Compared with findings of both acute and chronic schizophrenia patients, the prevalence of ABPs seems to be representative of severity and acuteness of the illness. Two factors were identified with stable trait characteristics and might be of predictive value for the course of the illness. Further studies with bigger samples are needed to further test the value of ABPs as early markers of detection and predictors of clinical course. The association between DSEs and ABPs warrants further investigation."

It sucks that you’re memory isn’t good enough to remember what you read. I got mysteriously, but strangely comfortably sleepy a couple of hours ago. It was initially hard to take a nap because I surprisingly felt a little bit uncomfortable. But nonetheless, I fall asleep. I wake up an hour later, and I have this anxiety that I haven’t felt. I thought I wasn’t going to be able to shake it. Then I went on the computer and it kind of faded away. But nonetheless my reading is EVEN WORSE. Initially, I couldn’t even read more than a sentence. Then somehow I adjusted, and I can read, but it’s pretty slow. I looked at a 45 message thread and it took me 10 minutes(at least) to read. ****, this is insane.

176140001,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

174377839,"Psychology Today Dietary Sugar and Mental Illness: A Surprising Link Sugar and Mental Illness: A Surprising Link Noted British psychiatric researcher _NAME_ has conducted a provocative cross-cultural analysis of the relationship between diet and mental illness. His primary finding may surprise you: a strong link between high sugar consumption and the risk of both depression and schizophrenia . In fact, there are two potential mechanisms through which refined sugar intake could exert a toxic effect on mental health. First, sugar actually suppresses activity of a key growth hormone in the brain called BDNF . This hormone promotes the health and maintenance of neurons in the brain, and it plays a vital role in memory function by triggering the growth of new connections between neurons. BDNF levels are critically low in both depression and schizophrenia, which explains why both syndromes often lead to shrinkage of key brain regions over time (yes, chronic depression actually leads to brain damage). The
re’s also evidence from animal models that low BDNF can trigger depression. Second, sugar consumption triggers a cascade of chemical reactions in the body that promote chronic inflammation. Now, under certain circumstances (like when your body needs to heal a bug bite), a little inflammation can be a good thing, since it can increase immune activity and blood flow to a wound. But in the long term, inflammation is a big problem. It disrupts the normal functioning of the immune system, and wreaks havoc on the brain. Inflammation is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and even some forms of cancer . . . it’s also linked to a greater risk of depression and schizophrenia. And again, eating refined sugar triggers inflammation. So does eating heavily processed molecular cousins like ‘high fructose corn syrup’. If you think about it, it makes sense that our bodies don’t handle refined sugar very well. After all, for the vast majority (99.9%) of our existence as a species
, there simply was no such sugar. We were endowed with a sweet tooth so that we’d crave the highly nutritious fruits that were available - sometimes in short supply - in the ancestral environment. But with the advent of processed sugar cane a few centuries ago, the blessing of our formerly adaptive sweet tooth suddenly turned into a curse - causing us to crave foods that we were simply never designed to process. As I’ve become increasingly convinced by these research data, I’ve begun gently encouraging my depressed patients to simply try cutting out sugars for a couple of weeks to see if they notice any effect. (I also ask them to cut out simple starches - like crackers and white bread - which the body converts directly to sugars). A few have had the courage and determination to given it a go: they’re reported remarkable improvements in mood, energy, and mental clarity."

Sometimes I have to force myself to play something too. Cause the games ain’t gonna play themselves lol. I’m the same way now. Takes me weeks to complete games that should only take 40 hours total.

It’s still considered sza by my doctor since it initially came with paranoia and delusions. The big diff between hearing voices when you’re not delusional and hearing them when you are is that they hold a lot less power over you if you’re not delusional. They can’t trick you into believing things, and you’ll never mistake them for the voices of real people like family or friends. It’s more like, there goes my brain again, firing off randomly with the voices /rolleyes. You’ll also never assume you’re reading people’s minds or hearing people’s thoughts.

174377865,"ScienceDaily Schizophrenia risk gene linked to cognitive deficits in mice: Restoring... Researchers have discovered in mice how one of the few genes definitively linked to schizophrenia, called SETD1A, likely confers risk for the illness. Mice genetically engineered to lack a functioning version of the enzyme-coding gene showed... Experimentally reinstating normal expression of SETD1A in adult mice restored the animals’ working memory function. Moreover, inhibiting expression of a gene called LSD1, which counteracts SETD1A, corrected all of the animals’ behavioral and neuronal communication abnormalities. Evidence indicated that many of these mechanisms identified in mouse brain have been conserved through evolution and likely play similar roles in humans. Reactivating SETD1A function or counteracting downstream effects of SETD1A deficiency in the adult brain, perhaps with LSD1 inhibitors, may hold promise for treating schizophrenia’s cognitive deficits, suggest the researchers. “Although S
ETD1A mutations exist in a small percentage of all schizophrenia patients, many people diagnosed with the disorder have issues similar to those caused by this mutation,” explained Gogos. “Thus, therapies that are specific to SETD1A may indeed have wider implications for schizophrenia as a whole.”"

Sometimes people function but there can be drawbacks or relapses or times when you still can break.

Otherwise, there are times when I do just stare into spare or feel so low that I hardly recognize my own self at all. Erotomania was extremely painful and uncanny in its convincing. I mean seeing 333,333 in conjunction with songs or other things that seem almost undeniably connected? All that to lead to a severe heart-crushing crash that seems to never end? I have to fish out reasons to live. Fish out reasons to want to survive when otherwise I hardly can muster the strength to care at all without wanting to just stare into space and not worry about what might happen if I lost consciousness 
completely? I even walk out talking to myself and have moments where I feel embarrassed that other people are thinking what a ??????? whacko I look like. And the fact I wear the same thing every day?

Having the cooking and organisational skills to implement a healthy diet quite another. If I 'd have a personal cook and a personal dietician. Exercise- Don’t do very much at the best of times.Even less so since the COVID19 situation. Do some basic exercises for balance and muscle weakness."
176140174,Tell your medical team that you get it. I suffered through a weekend of it and couldn’t sleep bless the meds they took it right away.
176140175,Done! You know the cost!
174377875,Maybe abilify at a lower dose wouldn’t give you those problems. If I remember correctly you said you were on 25mg. Thats a really high dose.

176140177,"I usually give money to people with signs, theres only a few beggars in this city tho and i rarely go downtown.

176140178,"I’m not sure if you would consider them delusional, but in my teen years I was decided that I was going to move to the Yukon and live off the land. In hindsight, it wasn’t particularly realistic thinking that’s for sure I mean, I could have done just that but I think I would have been miserable. Then I started to make new friends around 17 years old, and things improved for me emotionally and socially after I met my first girlfriend. But then the really ?????? up thinking returned around 25 years old, and I knew I needed psychological help but seeking it in that day was considered a weakness and shameful In hindsight, I have bean ill on and off for most of my life. It just didn’t show up until later in my life as being obvious"
176140179,No I try not to mute anyone.
176140180,I can’t die until the house is clean. Maybe that’s why it’s a mess.
176140181,I realized I had no idea what was happening to me.
176140182,"Yeah I used to get those feelings but I started to view paying attention to news and politics as a hobby. It improves my mood greatly. Sure I might not be in the know or ready for the mythical apocalypse but that’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make in order to enjoy my life more. Controversial, I know. Some call it apathy but I genuinely believe politics is a hobby and not a healthy one. Better off playing bridge or DND or basketball or video games. Imo."

176140184,Getting off nicotine is the choice of better health. Yes. It seems to help calm anxiety and research says maybe frontal cortex which is lacking in sz peeps but it’s a drug and it’s highly addictive. Getting off nicotine is the best thing I ever did in my life from a 25 year habit… From what i understand. Snus doesn’t cause as much cancer as chewing tabacco. It is highly addictive and leads to other concerns. From what I’ve seen of vaping it is early days but brings it’s own problems… Use this sane idea. Give up nicotine and be well.
176140185,Yes. i am going to go back to that schedule
176140186,A good therapist should be interested in you and what you have to say. You need a new therapist
174377880,My couple of above posts don’t speak for everyone but I believe in the stress vulnerability model ie: if you get stressed for any reason including too many good things it will make a schizophrenic vulnerable to relapse I’ve been taught this by medical professionals
176140187,I love it
176140188,I think you will have more replies if you split it into more posts or if you do a shorter summary.
176140189,Thanks for posting _AT_MENTION_ . Interesting interview – the author has sza.
174377883,"She’s increasing my lamictal cause I’ve been having some dark mood shifts, voices telling me to hurt myself, suicidal thoughts, etc etc, hoping that helps. She’s also adding on 10mg of abilify daily to my 3mg risperidone. Hopefully that helps take the voices away. That’s all I’ve got for this month. Wishing everyone well!"

176140191,"Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_ ! Yeah, only time will tell with a new medicine."
176140192,I’m with you on that one. I quit in 1990. I quit all drugs including alcohol.
176140193,"You can’t help having _PERSON_’s. You CAN help whether or not you hurt people. Having a mental illness means YOU have to work to control your symptoms. Your happiness is not your partner’s responsibility. If your mental illness is making you get mad at him over things, it’s your responsibility to break up with him and go to therapy to learn how to stop hurting people. He should not have to put up with being abused because you have a mental illness. And yes, this sounds like abuse. Men can be abused too."

176140198,I also started preschool a year early. I wonder if that helped me a lot. I think I got a good mother who tried her best and helped me along the way. Probably why my Aspergers wasn’t so severe.

176140201,I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . Keep trying! Failing doesn’t have to be permanent.
176140202,You seem fine to me …
174377872,"I attended one specifically for schizophrenia sufferers. It was run by a Psychiatrist who treated us all like babies and as if we were all as thick as pig ????. What an ignorant Psychiatrist. I couldn’t wait to get out of there. Yes, talk it over with your parents If I found another schizophrenia group to attend I would definitely give it a go, it’s a great way to make friends."
176140203,"Isn’t it like 1%. There is like 7.5. billion people on this earth I think. So 1% of 7.5 billion. So that would be 7,500.000 people. Is that right?"
176140204,Fingers crossed _AT_MENTION_ ! I really hope the invega gives you relief of ur symptoms. Yeah it may be a miracle drug for you…it seems to help a lot of people. Good luck with the work situation too.
176140205,"For me it is mostly the cops too. I was arrested awhile back and physically abused by the officers. I wasn’t out of control, just got caught with pot in an illegal state was all and the cop threw me to the ground and jumped on me. From there he labeled me as hostile and they treated me accordingly, even bringing out a taser causing me to vomit and urinate on myself so to say that I don’t like cops is a little understated. I ended up two months in jail on an unrelated charge later that year because I got pulled over and the cop asked me to step out and I drove off instead because I wasn’t about to be alone with another cop after the last time. There was probably news trucks by the time they threw out the tack strips and disabled my vehicle but there was also so many of them that not one of them would have thought to abuse me in front of everyone else so I was handcuffed and taken to jail gently like one not resisting should be. Cops are ridiculous sometimes"
176140206,Thank you!
176140207,I can feel it too. I don’t mean to be mean _NAME_. I haven’t felt good in years. I was severely depressed by 2004. It took all of my 20s and I’m 38 now. I used to think I could continue to be happy. No. I’m sorry for what I said to you in 2001. Mental illness is no excuse. I hope you can forgive me. I developed a love for you and _NAME_ and even _NAME_. Who would be no fun if they’re stuck in a mental ward? I no longer carry a light. Idk about strength. Make a song.
176140208,Manmade or divine sz ?
176140209,"You already know the reason for your thoughts - your wife’s wanting a divorce. Now, you need some kind, self talk about how you will get through this and some rational plans to make yourself happy. Whatever floats your boat ( as the young kids say). Anything from a soak in the tub, a cup of tea, a movie, a confidant, a pet, and so on."
174377884,Well I hear voices every day and used to have delusions and paranoia so I definitely agree with doctors that I am schizoaffective. I’ve recovered a great deal but there is no cure so the diagnosis remains accurate.
176140210,"I got disability a little over a year ago. Yes, it will probably take you several years to get it but you get back pay from the time you initially were denied the first time to the time you finally get it, if you do finally get it."
176140211,"Through practice I found ways to reduce a set of reoccurring memories of a very toxic 2012 phone call. Part of it was that I worked it out in my head, gave forgiveness to those involved, and accepted unpleasant truths about who I was at that time and how I’m still a selfish person. These thoughts are less frequenct now, sometimes they return but I have methods to dismiss them. Now other negative memories, long past and recent, come at me to fill the void. At least there’s more variety and not the same spam."
176140212,"_AT_MENTION_ is this all free hand? I mean, I know you’re doing it on the computer, but you are just freestyling this with the brushes? Pretty ??????? impressive man"
176140213,"Sorry, _AT_MENTION_. That’s a real tough situation. I hope things improve for you and your family."
176140214,I’ve lost 10lbs in the last month and all I’ve changed is my sugar intake. It gets easier over time.
176140215,"Diet, exercise and being active throughout the day. Rest is important too!"
176140216,Drinking alcohol while on psych meds is not a good idea. Don’t skip your meds.
176140217,"I’ve been on med’s a long time. I like what Geodon and Seroquel have done to my mind, but they weaken me dramatically physically. These med’s will probably take a decade off my life span. I could perform so much better sexually if it wasn’t for the med’s. I’m now dependent on the med’s. I’ve learned I can’t get off of them. But I have to question the wisdom of the decision to put me on med’s in the first place. If it wasn’t for the med’s I could get a job outdoors, digging ditches. I’d be happy to do it. But the med’s mess up your body’s temperature regulation mechanisms. I’d get pneumonia pretty quickly in the cold. In the summer I would get heat stroke. I think I could have recovered somewhat if I had just been set outside and told to do gofer/ditch digging work. As it is, I’m almost helpless."
176140218,"Me too, took about two months but then it has been working so far"
176140219,Idk which one to do. Abilify improved my negative symptoms by a lot but from what I remember it started to cause uncontrollable shopping addiction at doses above 10mg so I will have to take at least 2mg Risperdal with it. Vraylar is supposed to be better as I can take the max dose no problem. I don’t want to restart my outside life if I am not 100% on the best possible meds.
176140220,Ok then…I’m gonna bow outta this one. Tryin’ to be on good behavior as I tend to get threads locked or myself suspended. In before the lock though…
174377876,Sorry your going though this just remeber god loves you and this is just a test that will turn out better in the end these voices are lieing to you and will leave you and get tired of you in time
176140221,"It is not viable, I tried and the doctors prescribed me incorrect meds. I had to speak to get them changed. They also saw it as sign of psychosis and used it as one of a few reasons to section me."
176140222,But I have been using my right arm more often than usual taking care of my puppy. Carrying her and walking her a lot. Maybe you are on to something _AT_MENTION_ Thanks!
176140223,Yeah. I didn’t mean to come accrosss as mean. But you really should quit. I smoked 18 years and quit when I was 33 yo. Whatever it takes you should do it tho. GL

176140226,Maybe some ap’s turns off this urgency of life…maybe like our biological clock. I’m not in a hurry to do anything any more even though I know time is precious. I try to keep myself occupied and do something meaningful or that gives me a sense of joy.
176140227,Thank you. I’m sure all will go ok with my regular psychiatrist. Thanks for your kind words.

176140234,"I remember a long time ago, a classmate of mine told us what he discovered about reading about death omens. He said when you start reading, you begin to see those omens everywhere and more often. So he advised us not to read about them. Maybe its explained bc the brain seeks confirmation and quickly filters through randomness to see those patterns? Forgetting that there Are Real coincidences that you ignore as glitches in the universe? Fading into background consciousness…given as normal occurrence. Maybe in worse cases, schizos start projecting their confirmation bias on to the world? Thats why they see patterns? Anxiety might narrow the interpretive focus?"

176140256,I always wanted to get off the antipsychotic… but if I was paranoid why would they take me off? Is that not part of psychosis…? Also the problem seems much more bigger in my head than the reality… people probably have forgotten what i did or don’t even know what I did but it still eats me up…i am happy when I talk about my colleagues… my partner doesn’t lie or defend me … i know I get paranoid. I am glad he doesn’t agree with everything i say or else i would be under an illusion that my colleagues want me out.
176140257,My mental health people have me diagnosed as borderline pd as well and I don’t agree with them either. I’m with you on that. It’s just their way of covering their as-es.

For me it is non-verbal ,spatial, executive functioning and processing speed. The last one is task dependent . It’s hard to tell whether I 've just experienced the cognitive decline that’s standard for my age, or a decline that goes beyond that . I have the spiky profile typical of many on the autism spectrum . I’ll freely admit I worry about developing dementia . Ironically anxiety can have a negative effect on cognition , as can depression . It’s good that the cognitive problems associated with psychosis are taken more seriously nowadays .

will suffocate After a period of experience with sz,the person returns to life and engages in various human activities. A person must take care of himself,to make a double mental effort (throughout waking time) until he gets positive ideas,taming feelings and producing behavior responses that suit the situation he interacts with If he does not,the pathogen will take care of the mental state of the person and symptoms of sz will appear throughout the ideas and behavior (cognitive suffocation ) A quiet condition,relaxation or rest is nonexistence most time of waking Meaning,sitting alone at home or in a beach without thinking about any topic,imagining things or restore some memories events are considered rare phenomena"
176140273,"Honestly I just live with my voices. I even talk to them sometimes. They never threaten me or threaten to control anything. They just say positive things and sometimes narrate what I’m doing. They wish me a good night when I sleep and stuff. I don’t think anybody can make someone else hear voices. I used to think the guards in jail were poisoning my food so I wouldn’t eat it. I lost so much weight and was 135 lbs at one point (5’11""). Very efficient diet method. I hope things get better for you soon. I wish I could hang out on a farm TBH, I hate the clustered city vibe in Oakland."

176140275,I have reason to suspect that several of my hospital stays were due to borderline symptoms not only sza
176140276,No. Your worthy of kindness like we all are. It doesn’t matter what they say…that is just things that are based on poor thinking. You are a human like us all. You deserve a life even with sz. We all do deserve a good existence. It does matter. Our lives really do so keep cool and keep working. It’s not easy. It really isn’t but you can get to some level of being even on the meds…

I have had the same delusion you are dealing with and will again. My medication helps me stabilize and come out of these delusions the best. I just came out of some of these delusions a little over a week ago. I will go through this again, as part of my symptoms. Without the meds I was feeling very very bad and felt very very wrong. With the meds I dont feel so wrong,but this turned to frustration, irritability anger which are still very bothersome."

I simply don’t know if my health would allow it. However as I said, it is and opportunity that I think I should aim for, and as such I intend to prepare by reading the core text for the course. I aim to read five pages a day. I will almost certainly have to re-read the book several times. There are roughly 400 pages in the book, twelve chapters, so I am also aiming to read a chapter a month. I am on page ten. Having read five pages today and five a couple of days ago. There are fifteen pages in the first chapter, so I can definitely read and study it, taking relevant notes, several times over the coming month. I might not do it every day, I’m going to see how far I can get. My priority is my sanity. I’m going to journal here my progress. So far, the key terms that I have noted are cost-effectivenes

Antipsychotic drugs help to calm these hallucinations, delusions etc by reducing the individuals ability to create sounds in mind, visualize pictures in mind, create thoughts in mind. They may still able to make but not strong like before thus individual can quickly distinguish whether its real or not even if make or come. Therapy techniques also helps for example question the voices, pictures, thoughts to see if its real or not, practical etc. This way using logic or reasoning also help to distinguish and once its found not real simply not respond to it even if the urge is there."

I stopped on my own, though I know the doctor wouldn’t think that was cool. I talk to him on Monday. We’ll see if I can get on a good regimen, right now I’ve got: …Now: 6pm -750mg divalproex, 100mg lamotrigine 9:45pm 750mg divalproex, 50mg lamotrigine Midnight 500mg divalproex I take a low dose of lamotrigine on an as needed basis for depression."
176140402,I’ve been on Geodon and Seroquel for about fifteen years. I like them. A lot of people swear by Geodon. One disconcerting effect that Geodon has on me is it diminishes my sex drive. The Haldol shot didn’t do that. Geodon must have an effect on my hormones. It’s still worth it not to be a zombie.

174377914,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Early treatment response in first episode psychosis: a 7-T magnetic resonance spectroscopic study of glutathione and glutamate. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Molecular psychiatry, Mar 24 2020 Early response to antipsychotic medications is one of the most important determinants of later symptomatic and functional outcomes in psychosis. Glutathione and glutamate have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for patients demonstrating inadequate response to dopamine-blocking antipsychotics. Nevertheless, the role of these neurochemicals in the mechanism of early antipsychotic response remains poorly understood. Using a longitudinal design and ultrahigh field 7-T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol in 53 subjects, we report the association between dorsal anterior cingulate cortex glutamate and glutathione, with time to treatment response in drug naive (34.6% of the sample) or minimally medicated first episode patients with schizophreniform di
sorder, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder. Time to response was defined as the number of weeks required to reach a 50% reduction in the PANSS-8 scores. Higher glutathione was associated with shorter time to response (F?=?4.86, P?=?0.017), while higher glutamate was associated with more severe functional impairment (F?=?5.33, P?=?0.008). There were no significant differences between patients and controls on measures of glutamate or glutathione. For the first time, we have demonstrated an association between higher glutathione and favorable prognosis in FEP. We propose that interventions that increase brain glutathione levels may improve outcomes of early intervention in psychosis."

I just try to eat 3 times a day and get some exercise to try to be healthy. I’ve accepted my weight gain some, and am no longer worried about it. btw. I put the 20 pounds back on when I stopped intermittent fasting. im a healthy bmi. maybe 5 to 10 pounds heavy but nothing alarming. good luck on your weight goals…maybe it would be good for you to lose some weight, but your mental health is important too, just do the best you can."

I wrote journal entries of quote unquote exactly what was said between me and my voices (by name where possible) every time I felt scared or stressed out (1st Person Transcripts) always complied with my meds, enabling me to absolutely minimise the dosage my psych. prescribed. I could take my summaries or actual 1st Person Transcripts to my psych to help answer their questions believed that the 1st person transcripts were like legal evidence proving I was innocent and my voices were guilty of (human) crimes against me. SO I was able to know I was good, and being vtimized by unknown, unacknowledged, (non-existant) life forms got help from a qualified social worker through my doctor. And read these forums. This led to a belief in my own good, and proof of crimes against me, by beings that my psych and science claim don’t exist - and I won. I can kill them, but I forgive. And I won."

I managed to get an appointment for the doctor next week, maybe I’ll get something to relieve the unpleasant feelings at least. Those feelings are the main concern, because when I was in the hospital the torture went very bad, and the “spirit” tried to kill me there on several occasions (it could have been because my condition was so bad I maybe preferred not to exist, and the “spirit” detected that)."

174377964,I have insight and I do not have schizophrenia like you do. I am being poisoned.
176140675,Thanks for the advice _AT_MENTION_
176140676,I’m on 60 mg and currently (not always) symptom free. I function like I don’t have the illness.
176140677,"_AT_MENTION_ , you was on Zyprexa too, isn’t it? How so it works against the depression? Me, i find too, that it works against the negatives a bit, against the depression… It doesn’t really put me to sleep still either…"
176140678,"I am happy that I didn’t have the dangerous catatonia type, only had stupor. Excitatory catatonia is life-threatening and the person becomes a danger to himself and his surrounding. But catatonia still feels like death. Its the worst feeling one can get and its that that destroyed my brain permanently. I hope they find a med for it and for negative and cognitive symptoms. From Wikipedia Excited Catatonia: “It is commonly cited as one of the most dangerous mental states in psychiatry.”"

176140681,I take the smallest dose at 25 mg per night and I seem to have adjusted to that dose quite well and typically don’t have troubles sleeping

176140685,[editing because I misread the question] They will probably tell you what tests you are getting done.
174377962,She was definitely a lot farther along the spectrum than me. You know those people who are so smart that it comes at the cost of social functioning? That was her.
176140686,"I’m preety sure it is the end. I was in a medication induce coma for a few days and there was nothing, not dreaming, not hearing, not seeing, not thinking. Nothing at all. Its hard to explain but you simply don’t exist anymore, this is the hardest concept to ruminate (that we will become nothing at all, it’s scary I know but when the time come we will not know a thing, we purely stop existing) When I woke up I was scared and screaming and everything was confusing and new in the first seconds. Then I quickly got down to earth."
176140687,I don’t know if I was intelligent or just educated?

174377980,Thankyou it’s nice to hear that you are feeling differently on amisulphride. I really will consider a med change But just gonna be very prudent about it like pros n cons
174377973,Welcome to the forum! Are you taking any medications? Medicine and therapy combo have really helped get my symptoms under control.
176140689,"When I say effect, I mean the voices went completely for both durations, except hypnogoggic ones come and go but those are apparently normal in neurotypical too"

174377971,Yes. I was late onset. It didn’t hit me until 38. The Marine Corps let me do four years schizophrenic though. I retired with full benefits at 42. It was tough. I was really sick and didn’t know it. After I retired I still tried to work full time until I was 45 without much luck and then went on SSDI. But I am off of SSDI now and work full time again. I was 48 when I went back to work and came off SSDI. Now I am 50. I collect taxes for the IRS. It’s a federal job. I am not really good at it but they haven’t fired me yet.

176140703,Part of my problem is that my present situation is going under. There’s never much peace and a lot of bad behavior and I am tense all the time because of it. I also miss one housemate who is gone visiting untll the 21st.

174377988,"Hydroxyzine really worked for me in the beginning of my illness, in fact it still works. But the main issue for me is that my psychosis started after I got taken off of Hydroxyzine. Now, it might very well be that it’s just correlation, but still, I would be careful with becoming too dependent on it. I guess, though, since Hydroxyzine is such a powerful antihistamine, whatever antihistamines you’ll be on it would not create a dependency. I also have super high histamine, which creates a lot of issues regarding allergies, so hopefully you don’t have as high of histamine as I do."

She gave me bupropion instead. I think I’m more distinctly hearing voices again so I will give this one more day before I see a different doctor that is closer. I want to try vraylar. My dna test said I would have lesser side effects on it than abilify. When I was on abilify my reaction time to everything was so slow it felt like I had multiple symptoms of dystonia. I hope its not the same with vraylar. I also saw that vraylar is weight neutral. Maybe I will lose weight on it? I dunno… Great news to know though!

Try to reward his efforts rather than his results, and his nature may change, making him more stress-tolerant.

174378009,"Since September 2014 I experienced many fascinating coincidences. I had diagnoses of schizotypal disorder or sometimes even (paranoid or unprecised) schizophrenia, probably because of them. I take psychotropic drugs regularly last months, but these mysterious phenomena still happened. I concluded that important “groups” of my coincidences were associated with: geometrical sequences, arithmetical sequences, prime numbers, numbers 21 and 7, 3, 6, 9 (an arithmetic sequence with three terms and sum 18) 21, 42, 84 and its descending counterpart, 84, 42, 21 (fascinating geometric sequences) 33, 42, 51, 6, 13, 20, 13 and 31, Thabit numbers (also known as 321 numbers). Below I describe rather “fresh” example of coincidences. 14.10.2018 - I saw Big Hole encounter in certain computer game made in Russia. On it there was body of _NAME_ with shampoo. There were also rock and rope. 18.10.2018 I found Polish word for shampoo in third link for query with English transliteration of Russian name of certain 
creature from the game in which Big Hole was present. On page about “Engrish” I saw word “shampoo” the same day. Next day I thought about shampoo in a large shop and some moments later I heard advertisements of two shampoos. 22.10.2018, three days later, I thought about shampoo again in the same shop and some moments later again I heard advertisements of two shampoos! 4.5.2019, about 5 p.m., I checked if there was image of black cat on item found in remains of sergeant _PERSON_ in other encounter from the same Russian game. The encounter was named “Dear _NAME_”. Black cat’s image was present on the item, the film was from the same channel on YouTube as the film from 14.10.2018. Few moments later i typed query chicken-kicken (without quotation marks) in Google and in results there was a link to the film named “The legend of Big _NAME_”. In V 2019 I saw screenshot of Giant Egg special encounter from the same computer game. On the screenshot in left down part of it there was such a text: You se
e: Egg. This heavy egg stuck in the hole and now will not move anywhere. You see: Hole. Obviously, a hole dug by animals. Hardly you’ll fit inside. When I typed name of a very similar game to that with Big Hole, “Dear _NAME_” and Giant Egg and the word eggs in Google (without quotation marks), I saw link to the page about certain sort of “eggs” (references to popular culture) in that game. I opened that link and first “egg” was about the logo on which there were numbers 5 and 23 on left side and number 421 on right side. I nicknamed it “giant egg”. Earlier (since about winter 2018/2019) I had coincidences with triplet interestingly similar to 5, 23, 421 - 7, 29, 139."

I will explain the situation: It’s been 2 years I take adderral 40mg everyday (before I was taking Vyvanse 60mg, since 2013). I also take seroquel to sleep since a long time. My psychiatrist prescribed me risperdal 1mg, which I took between june 14-august 06. On july 26, I took a drug named “_NAME_” (which is MDMA I think), and I had a bad trip for 1 month (paranoia and anxiety). I almost lost my libido (I can still have ejaculate but I have no erection) since I take risperdal or mdma, I don’t really remember. I know my libido was very low when I took risperdal (which is a normal side effect). Then, my psychiatrist prescribed me abilify 2mg, which I took between september 14 and october 27.

176140910,"On Friday afternoon, my mother in-law was killed in a horrific workplace accident. She was thrown from the cab of a train and then run over… We’re told there was no dismemberment and it was likely instantaneous, so she did not suffer a painful slow death, which is only slightly comforting. My husband is suffering in a way he’s never experienced, and is grieving hard. I have been trying to be the rock for he and my kids (9 and 6), and trying harder than I ever have to suppress my psychotic nature. I have been determined not to spill my egocentric delusions all over everyone and let them grieve in peace, but if I dont get this out I’m going to explode… and there’s no one else I can talk to. One of my very first (and by far scariest) delusions 14-15yrs ago was that I was dying in a horrific violent accident. First and usually a car accident, but there were train tracks next to the scene of the accident so sometimes I was also mutilated by a train (more specifically bisected). At every scen
e of accident/delusion scenario, my mother would be weeping and screaming for me, and I would sometimes also hear sirens in the distance and the beeps and static of police walkie talkies, or hear officers and paramedics trying to save me. But ALWAYS, I would hear my mother. When we told my children, they sobbed, screamed “NOOO!”, were inconsolable. I am usually quick on my feet with them and know just what motherly things to say to soothe them, but this time I was quiet. Not only because my husband hates spiritual talk (which really cut me off from saying what I wanted to say about her soul etc), but because of my mind going straight to the dark place and hearing what I always hear. Over the years, my delusions have involved a car crash, being hit by a train, my suicide attempt in '07 being a success, accidentally overdosing in the bathroom when I had an addiction problem a few years ago, some type of organ failure or cancer, and many more, with the common element that this world is not real, THIS is the 
delusion and I’ve not yet figured out what IS real. What I’ve been dwelling on this week and trying to hold in so that my husband can grieve in peace, is that in 2012, years after my suicide attempt, my father in-law committed suicide and my best friend did also 2 years after. After I got clean, my brother in-law overdosed in his bathroom. A couple of years ago, my uncle died of cancer, then a month later my grandfather died of pneumonia and heart failure. Six days ago, my mother in-law was run over by a train… what I heard the kids screaming and crying is exactly what my mother sounds like when she finds out I’m dying/dead."

176140921,Yeah try clubs/sports/pastimes that you like. The internet is great for getting like minded folk together. Cricket really provides me with a lot. I still get the enjoyment from playing against other normals…and I socialize and have to with the people. It also gives me work in volunteering.

The question why it does not let me enjoy things permanently remains; I don’t think I’ll ever find the answer to it (although right now an inserted thought claimed I’ll find it out after death, when I’m going to be tortured). An exception to this is that these days I can still feel the good in taste (which my schizophrenia also has the ability to remove - sometimes it does it in the middle of eating something and then it is more noticeable)."

176140943,"I heard that calorie diet is less recommended if you want to lost weght. It’s because carbs increase insulin much higher than protein or fat, even though their calories are the same. If you have sensitive insulin levels caused by consuming a large amont of carbs, you would crave for food more and gain weight eventually. So I recommend to avoid carbs but consume proteins or vegetables more on your diet. Understanding insulin hormone was much helpful for me for controlling my diet."

I may truly “believe”, be convinced that aspijkas (women with _PERSON_’s) do not defecate, flatulate, urinate, do not have genitals (external and internal), buttocks, anus and rectum, liver, pancreas, intestines, kidneys, lungs, heart, brain, blood, hemoglobin, heavy-metal-dependent enzymes in body. And I may think that being “delusional” is good for me, helps making me chaste. If a woman wrote that she defecates or had blood blood test, I may “believe”, “assume” that fallen angel logged onto her account and wrote that.

My psychiatrist said Clozapine never causes akathisia and that it will most likely cure my delusions. My delusion is that when I go outside of my apartment, people begin spitting on me. I also have hallucinations sometimes, namely auditory ones, where I hear voices that insult me. A couple of days ago I had to sleep alone and I woke up in the middle of the night, thinking there was someone in the apartment waiting in front of my room but nothing happened. I am scared to sleep alone in the apartment, because most of the time I don’t have to, and I don’t know if clozapine will change that or my other delusions.

From personal experience, there were points in psychosis where I had lucidity, but these were very brief in the relentless passages of paranoia and delusions. My memory was also disappearing the further into psychosis I went. I would question how well Nash could function if his symptoms did not lessen. It’s a shame there weren’t more interviews from him."
174378074,"I read a study about it one time. For men and women presenting with the same symptoms, men were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar, women were more likely to be diagnosed with borderline."

176141046,Hello _PERSON_. My guardian has always been good to me and I believe in him. It’s the others who are bad mainly because they urged me to do things or made me paranoid. I don’t miss the dangerous things I used to do or the paranoia. I would get very personal messages from the TV and the internet. I would be convinced everyone hates me like even people who don’t know me.There was a lot of them in my head telling me over and over how much they hate me and I could FEEL their hate. This made me cry for hours.
176141047,To diary was the worst day of my life. I heard my neighbour arguing last night and this morning I heard the same. I saw projections of human life displayed on my walls and became convinced I was being surveiled. In response my family tried to section me
176141048,I hope my future kid doesn’t share it with anyone. It is just like inviting criticism.
174378077,Congratulations!!!
176141049,I’ve ramped it down to strong dislike from active hate. I don’t have to expend energy ruminating over past wrongs. That’s energy I don’t get to use in the present to make my life better.
174378075,Yes. I am on abilify with paliperidone for prolactin. My prolactin was just over 2000 I have to go back in a couple of months to see what it will be then since being on abilify. I’m only on 2.5mg at the moment but it’s foing to go up to 5mg. So far it’s not helped. But apparently it can take months for the levels to go back down.

So to give you the honest truth, when my coworker/employers and people at my high school ask me the question about the reflection in my eyes. I was stoned the first time I was asked it. Every other time I was not tripping or stoned. Especially whilst I was working. I had a vary strong attitude towards drug use in the work place I was 100% against drug use well working.

I took clonazepam and a tablet of nitrozepam before sleep. After two days I’m still anxious. Has anyone experienced something familiar?"

The floor was completely empty that day and it was weekend. I bought discount chocolate and buns. I spent whole day watching older Japanese cartoons alone and silent. Noone could possibly interrupt or interfere with me, and I finally stepped on a good track in life, with an honest intellectual career ahead of me. Looking back I was so happy I could cry. Schizophrenia took all and didn’t even choke."
176141125,"I have wondered about a connection between PTSD and schizophrenia myself. I developed PTSD after a car accident I was in, the schizophrenia came later. One article I read suggested that people with schizophrenia have a slightly different brain structure. That in itself does not cause schizophrenia, but when you add trauma to this mix the chances of developing schizophrenia go up quite significantly. I can’t claim to know anything about this, this is merely research for myself, to satisfy my interest in the disorder"

176141138,"I firmly believe OCD has psychotic components to it. I was diagnosed with OCD at age 5 and I had some strong obsessions with pretty wacky beliefs. Granted, I was also diagnosed with psychosis at age 24, so who knows when I switched over. But the cause doesn’t matter as much as the treatment. Your belief isn’t what makes you delusional. _PERSON_ also believes God is evil. But he can still go to school, do his chores, and make friends. His belief doesn’t affect his ability to be happy with his life. It is just a thing he thinks is true. The thing that makes you delusional is the way you let your belief consume every area of your life. It impacts your ability to be happy. That is what needs to be treated. Not the belief, but the way it defines every action you make."

174378095,"im on invega trinza now, originally i was on invega sustenna for 3 years. the first 18 months were kind of rough, i had a lot of side effects, like anhedonia or lack of pleasure, hand tremors, 35 pounds of weight gain, elevated cholesterol, jaw clenching, pacing back and forth around the house. but after about 18 months the side effects slowly started to go away and i felt normal again. alot of people don’t like invega, but it worked great on my positive symptoms. for me it took awhile to adjust to it, but now im addicted to it, as it balances out my moods, i rarely get too high or too low anymore. although i do miss my ‘ups’ mood wise. i also had lowered libido as a side effect. after a hospitalization they put me on the shots, as i was non med compliant, now i like the shots as i don’t have to worry about taking a pill a couple times a day. with trinza i get my shot every 84 days."

(That was what I suspected) I’m not telling anyone to stop taking the medicine. If you have to take it take. Even i’m taking it myself. since 2015. My case is as follows. For the simple luxury of my parents, they forced me in for marijuana. They don’t like me to smoke and think i have to obey their will. I saw myself as a normal person before the first internment, but they don’t. They say that I acted strangely, that I spoke to myself and blessed myself all the time. I don’t remember doing any of this. they interned me forced well say. It traumatized me and I think, almost certainly, developed all my illnesses I have today.

174378110,I’ve gotten worse in the past when meds haven’t worked on positive symptoms for me or they were so sedating they put my negatives through the roof and into the lower atmosphere. Always a challenge to find that happy balance.
176141182,Let me explain it to you in a story.
176141183,"Sometimes you stop to think what day it is and you aren’t sure. Did this 30 minutes ago. I was kind of thinking it was Sunday. It took me a minute to figure out today is Tuesday. I drive a lot slower than when I was younger. Now I tend to stay out of the fast lane. If I inadvertently find I am driving in the fast lane, I often will move over to the slow lane. And when I used to get new cars (not brand new—different) when I was younger, one of the first things I would do is get on the freeway and see how fast it could go. I stopped that in my thirties. In fact now I rarely, if ever, go faster than 80 mph."

176141184,"In psych wards is it normal for nurses to laugh at you when you tell them whats going on with you symptom wise (all i did was tell them im not sure if people are reading my thoughts or not), mimic/make fun of you, or to make light of the pain caused by the symptoms? I dont think this is a good place. Not being treated like a human. Im sick of people who dont have sz to describe it akin to diabetes. I know people with diabetes, they take a pill, watch their diet, and move on. So ignorant."
176141185,So you appeal to the argument of authority (the “Chinese argument” as _NAME_ labelled it). I guess I don’t think much of psychiatry. The SZ diagnosis itself is an extremely blunt category including many different conditions.

Some studies have indicated that women have a lower response to treatment with clozapine, whereas others indicate the opposite; however, the evidence uniformly supports that women have a higher risk of developing diabetes, and that men are more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities and have higher cardiovascular risks from clozapine treatment."
174378125,"I got schizophrenia when I was 20. It has been 11 years since then, I’m now 31.

Even then it’s a gradual thing but you’ll notice some change. Schizophrenia is a marathon it’s not a sprint. Be proactive in your health and just do the meds as prescribed. Routine helps. Take meds same time etc. Be patient. Often hard for a mind coming off of psychosis.

In a pro-medicine environment these are classified as symptoms caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, and any voices you hear are just hallucinations. Paranoia is also a symptom of the illness.

174378120,"Basically most serious mentall illnesses come with a drastic reduction in cardiorespitory fitness after the first episode as measured by VO2, maximal oxygen uptake. Antipsychotics independently also reduce maximal oxygen uptake. Abstract Basically I’m not saying to stop medication but perhaps to not feel discouraged when exercising as the subjective increased difficulty is real but normal. This suggests that the use of antipsychotic medication is associated with lower physical activity and poorer physical fitness (_PERSON_, 2016a). A point to emphasise in the present study is that physical fitness was evaluated with a greater range of physical tests (that cover muscular strength, flexibility, balance and aerobic condition) and in a larger sample than in the study by _PERSON_. (2016b), which gives us more information about the use of antipsychotics in this population. In addition, in the present study, it was found that aerobic condition is also altered by the use of antipsychotic medication, with 
worse levels of aerobic condition in the group taking this type of medication. Drugs like olanzapine with high metabolic effects are generally better at reducing symptoms. Link Again, without trying to destroy the body, maybe exercise and more lean meats could help with symptoms. Side-effects linked to improvements We also showed that metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics are linked to improvement in symptoms of schizophrenia. The more weight people put on and the higher cholesterol levels go up, the greater the improvement in symptoms. One explanation for this is that the neurotransmitters that mediate metabolic side-effects might also contribute to an improvement in symptoms. Personally after doing cardio a couple of times a week and drinking loads of caffeine in the past month I have drastically reduced the amount of self-harm and reacting with anger/destruction when frustrated, or blocked from purposes by family and even voices. I attribute it to the greater ability of my mind to cope with frustration, 
an ability that I surmise was reactivated with cardio exercise and caffeine. It’s like my nose is becoming more free."

Participants' psychopathology was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Neurocognitive functioning was assessed by 10 neuropsychological tests from a battery. Neurocognitive test scores were converted to scale scores and t-scores using normative data from Chinese populations.Males were younger and less likely to be married, had an earlier age of illness onset and a longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and scored higher on the PANSS negative, general and total scales than females. After con
trolling for potential confounders, females performed better than males in the verbal learning and memory domain (p=0.016). While most neurocognitive domains were correlated with PANSS negative scores for male patients with FES, for female patients with FES, negative associations were found between scores on the PANSS general subscales and neurocognitive domains. We also performed a case-control comparison with a group of patients with clinically stable schizophrenia (CSS) (n=60) who were matched by age, sex and education years with patients with FES (n=58). After controlling for potential confounders, no significant differences were found between patients with FES and patients with CSS in all neurocognitive domains. Female patients still performed better in the verbal learning and memory domain (t=2.14, p=0.034). No interaction effects of gender and disease were found.Gender was an independent influence factor for the verbal learning and memory domain. Both female patients with first-episode schizophrenia an

176141249,Its good that you have insight but a bit troubling that despite this you don’t want to cooperate with the treatments provided…
176141250,I came off my meds since christmas ive recently taken amitryptiline again but stayed off the olanzapine i think im hearing my neighbours again my psychiatrist said this was the schizophrenia not my neighbours but im not suicidial anymore which is good
176141251,Orange juice ….
176141252,Another non-scale victory. My favorite team on Sparkpeople asked me to be a co-leader! So it is me and three other people leading the team. My job is going to be to visit the individual pages of the people on the team (there’s 28 as of now) and send them goodies and comments. I am happy to be doing this.
176141253,My brain is fried. I’m now reading double/ triple meanings into the topics posted on these forums. I’ll return when the Olanzapine kicks in more…and when I’m feeling better. You’ve all been patient and good to me during the last few weeks of my manic behaviour and I really appreciate that.

176141262,"I’m sorry you’re struggling, _PERSON_. This autumn, I’m doing well so far. I’m hoping I don’t go into a deep depression this winter. Last winter, I went into a severe depression. My husband planned a road trip to _NAME_ shortly after my depression hit rock bottom and that gave me something to look forward to during the dark times. We traveled down to _NAME_ and spent time in the warmer weather while it was probably snowing back where we lived. It really helped me get through the winter. Maybe you can plan a mini vacation somewhere during the winter time. That way, you have something fun to look forward to."
176141263,"I’m sure whatever she is going through, if she just knew you were thinking about her it would brighten her day, knowing she has a thoughtful child like yourself to think and worry about her. I’m sure your concern for her makes her feel better. Take care Butterflyy and wise mom!"
176141264,"Damn, that reminds me, I have to take a shower and collapse tonight. Busy day tomorrow."
176141265,Switch to vaping like I did. It’s cheaper. I was spending the equivalent of $300/ month on cigarettes. Now I spend about $30/month on vaping.

176141273,Your apologies are accepted. I have 18 alters and thank you we are doing our best. And yes alters help fill gaps by writing things down! It really simplifies things and now that we can do it on our phone its even easier! We used to use sticky notes
176141274,"Sexual dysfunction and thinking that I will be ok as my mental health issue is not serious.I am also getting sleepy early in the work,my father used to be unhappy when I get to work and sleep…as it sets a very bad example for the workers. I stopped meds for a year,to be honest,there is no difference,I mean the pros of not taking antipsychotic is I get to work not feeling sleepy because of meds,my sexual function is better…but I am still anxious,depress(mild) with antipsychotic or without…now I am back on it but low doses"
176141275,I don’t know whats reasonable to expect of people. I’m hoping I find a nice girl who gives good back scratchies and maybe is a decent cook. Personality matters more though. Honestly I’m probably fine being single. Its just a mess to introduce someone new to not be critical of my weak points.
176141276,My neurologist said I was really smart and threw tennis balls at me and said I should never drink or do drugs well I’m drunk right now and have used drugs in high school maybe thAts why I’m crazy

176141278,"_PERSON_ initially it was just in my store then it became everywhere, even paranoid of my family at worst. I don’t remember how it went but I think it was a gradual, graded process cos I didn’t just wake up one morning and noticed a complete difference Why would they be monitoring you?"
174378128,I never heard voices. I got lucky in that respect. I’m still diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia though. Once I got on and stuck with abilify my sanity returned. That was 5 years ago. It happened quite quickly. I had a med increase recently from 10mg to 15mg. And that’s made things easier.
176141279,"I did about 5 stints in the Psyche Ward over the last decade or so. Each time it took me a few weeks to snap out of it. I’m on Abilify Injections every 3 weeks which has kept me sane for the most part, and out of the Hospital."
176141280,I might be working in a day care. Did it for 3 years a few years back. I love kids and they love me. I love people.
176141281,I hope so. 1515
176141282,"I’m withdrawing from remeron. It’s not fun, but right now I am not going to the hospital. I coped with some Yogi energy tea that has caffeine, it’s supposed to give you focus. The random pdoc I say Thursday said stop all caffeine. I was so out of it by stopping it and it did not touch the mania it just made me have less attention, hence why I walked out into the streets. I’m doing me, and having these appointments frequently are causing professionals to plant stuff in my brain, just random stuff. I’m drawing a puppy right now and trying to deal with the fact I get these symptoms, but I can’t let them control me because I’m better off focused on drawing. If I could, I’d have a home gym so I won’t have to go outside and draw and paint all day, taking some breaks to eat. Getting out 2-3 times a week to deal with mental health is overbearing. Im a loner"
174378135,Anyone here taking AP have no side effects whatsoever? And will that last forever? (having no side effects?) I just got my 400mg Abilify and having no side effects so far…or do I need to wait a little longer? I got it just 30 minutes ago.
174378132,And there is NO link between Abilify and hallucinations. It just means that Abilify simply didn’t work for you.
176141283,Easy for you to say. I’m 61 years old and an almost complete computer illiterate. I have no idea what to do.
174378129,"Hi, Japanese sencha green tea is different from other green teas. Not only it tastes delicious but also gives cognitive benefits and also improves mood thus helps in reducing negative symptoms. Its taste seem like a mix of pure green tea and Japanese matcha green tea. But surely better than both in taste and in mental effects. No wonder why it become the most popular tea in Japan. Everyone should try this especially if like green teas. When buying make sure its made in Japan as many sellers sell China made ones and also make sure its organic. Regards"
176141284,"It’s ok, I’ll probably change it back some day lol"
176141285,_AT_MENTION_ I agree with that

176141287,My mother tells me the same. I am sure one of my brothers wont take care of me as he’s selfish but I think the other might as he’s nice to me. I just dont know if he will still be nice to me after my parents die.

I was not afraid of my feelings until he kept suspecting me. I’m getting them (my feelings) back now and feel like it’s a welcome home, chordy. I’m actually a warm person."
176141293,"They used to record the lectures where I went, and I found that most useful for studying so I could follow at my own pace. The seminars were rubbish. Most of the time no one talked or wanted to contribute."

176141301,My Opinion is that none of my pdocs ever really understood how bad this is. Just because you are stable on meds doesnt mean you feel well at all. A high dose of fish oil has helped me a little. Dont know if you have ever tried it.
176141302,Head in The clouds Or Feet on the ground
176141303,No food just drinks
176141304,My anxiety is slightly better. But not enough to feel safe.
176141305,My diagnosis was changed from psychosis to sz after quitting my meds and getting another psychosis within 6 months. Idk how it is in every country but my psychiatrist told me that if I get another psychosis without meds within 6 months of the 1st one its sz.

176141309,I wish I could have developed a skill since my teenage years that I can work on and craft and feel happy about. But once I became mentally ill I just completely withdrew and stopped caring or trying about most aspects of my life. Financial independence would be nice or even just having a relationship like my sister does. Or feeling like a productive member of society. Any and all of these things. But I can’t help but think the ages 13-19 were totally wasted. And then the years after I was only trying to recover.
176141310,"He’s the oldest. Yesterday was his Birthday. I didn’t call him. Usually I do but he always acts weird and tries to come up with some excuse why he has to get off the phone right away. I don’t know if he doesn’t like me or if he just doesn’t like talking on the phone. It sad. But it’s enough that I didn’t even bother calling him yesterday. He’s extremely intelligent. He’s friendly. He’s a little unusual and is involved in SCA and spends a lot of time programming computers and other introverted activities. He like to play D & D and has since I was a little girl . I remember as a small girl thinking of him as my Father rather than my brother because he seemed so much older than me. I used to call him _NAME_ or _NAME_. He’s the first person I knew to have a PC, it cost $5000. That was very expensive for back then and not many had them. He taught himself how to program and eventually became a programmer for the county. Good guy. Wish we were closer. I hope he’s doing well."

176141320,Anyone know what’s up with her?
174378137,"You’re right the meds are doing their job and that’s all that matters. I may or may not be diagnosed with schizophrenia. It doesn’t matter as long as I tell my doc everything and do what he says and the home based Crisis team says. I’ll need therapy and regular visits to the hospital as an outpatient. I can tell you, I never in my life had a year so awful and debilitating as this year. It was horrific. I was practically bedridden. My thoughts worsened considerably and I was zombie like. I’ll post here how I get on with doc in the next week following this week. I hope to see just the one doc that I’m presently seeing because that way he and I get a better understanding of my illness instead of seeing different psychiatrists I hope to remain the psychiatrist I’m seeing now his patient. Thanks for your insight. I am definitely not right this past year for sure and they know that at the hospital.i hope I dont get worse."

176141331,Its more psychological pain than physical you know really painfull feelings.
176141332,"This is what I mean about things coming back to me psychically or through synchronicities. I email something to people I don’t know, and coincidentally everything seems to respond as if everybody knows what I wrote. It makes me start to think that everybody, or some people writing, are paid government workers, because how else would they know what I had written in private. The next step is to get the impression that people are responding to my private thoughts, which is when I really start to relapse, and all of this happens because of my initial attempt to engage with high level strangers about high level issues. I need to focus on taking care of my well being like tidying my flat and cleaning myself and staying sane. Thank you."

176141336,Hey _AT_MENTION_ Lithium didn’t really help balance my ups and downs. It also depends on which dose you are on? What it did give me was hypothyroidism. I stopped taking it years ago.

176141343,"I think these are the best lyrics of yours that Ive seen, great work man! I think theyll fit pretty well on that beat too. My advice is go a little slower than the beat (like the beat is dragging you along if that makes sense) and follow the hi hats. Id keep your voice low and breathy since its a more ambient/atmospheric track, but match the energy of the song. For example at 1:56 sing or rap a bit louder than the previous verse to match the slightly higher energy. Thats just a few ideas on how I would do it, but in the end theyre your lyrics, so deliver them in a way that the emotion you feel behind them gets felt by whoevers listening. I can already tell this is gonna be good so dont forget to post the finished product!"
176141344,being with a partner Heaven and hell Saving the world I was apparently a central position in humanity but I was failing. Basically I killed the person whose role it was with my mind somehow and so I had to take over even though I wasn’t fit for it. I was therefore under a lot of pressure to change. Also ideas about after life maybe being us experiencing everything in the world and therefore making it our responsibility to change the whole world for the better so that the eternal afterlife is only good. For instance experiencing the torture of people in war camps if I didn’t put a stop to it
176141345,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry the once a week weighing didn’t help you. I know I was one of those who discouraged you from daily weigh-ins. I shouldn’t have assumed that what works for one will work for all! _AT_MENTION_ That is frustrating! I would have been upset too if I did all that exercise and didn’t lose. It’s good you’re sticking with the diet. Just keep doing what you’re doing right, and you’ll lose again! _AT_MENTION_ Under 160 is awesome! Congratulations!

176141369,Thanks for your insight! The dose makes the poison!
176141370,Dont lower it if it works. 50mg is a therapeutic dose and 75 is supposed to be minimum effective dose. 100mg i think hits a sweet spot. On 75mg I was getting more paranoid and having mini-psychosis episodes until one day I was hit with big ass pasychosis and spent 9 weeks in a hospital.

They were in other towns and countries and places but I heard their voices say these things. It made me withdraw from them and not want to be with them. I accused them a few times I think which they took offence to. I nolonger hear voices of any kind and don’t have delusions either anymore thankfully.

I also didnt take my meds the past couple days bc I was just too tired in the morning. Well that combined and I had a really bad flare up this morning. Basically I tried to go back to sleep when I got home. I had one of the worst headaches of my life at the time. Then I felt a very familiar evil presence and that demon came and attacked me. It kept saying that I belonged to it and needed to submit to it. I was so scared. I kept yelling at it and refusing but eventually got so overwhelmed by its horrible energy that I just gave in. Basically my thoughts were that this entity had created some sort of contract with me where it took away any pain I was feeling (emotional or physical) and would replace it with pleasure in return for my total obedience and basically becoming its possession. I told it I had never intended to form this sort of contract…but it doesn’t really care. I fir
st met the entity lurking on the sidelines back when I was abused by that malicious spirit. Then when I moved and my mental health was really bad I was suffering so much under the pain and it stepped in and “comforted” me, and the contract was unknowingly formed on my part by allowing it to do so. I still claimed it wasn’t fair because I didn’t know I was creating a contract with it and I didn’t so much allow it as not understand what the heck was going on at the time but demons don’t much care for that. The whole naivety of the law doesn’t mean immunity thing I guess. Anyways that was my experience today. I felt really shaken, ashamed and just bad after as I usually do. I apologized to God for being so weak and not being able to send it away."

176141438,"Hi. I’m on 5mg zyprexa. I have been on this drug for about 15 years in different dosages. It does the job to make me sleep, but ironically it also causes severe restlessness in the daytime. That kicked in about 7 years in. Before that I was able to sleep without zyprexa, but now I have become drug dependant and need it every day to sleep. So you might want to think of zyprexa as a temporary aid, but on the other hand if you are able to stay on just one AP I would do that. The less chemicals the body gets the easier it will be for it to function normally. I have never been on more than one AP, but I imagine it increases difficulties to be on several drugs. I do struggle with some weight gain on zyprexa. It’s not so bad on 5mg, but if you go to higher doses you can expect it will be difficult to keep your current weight. Some supplements might be beneficial for depression. The first one that comes to mind is vitamin D. Some people report it to be toxic in high doses, but I would try to get about 
1250-2500 IU each day, which is a relatively low dose. At least that seems to help me. I also take fish oil, b-vitamin complex, l-lysine, l-carnitine(which is proven to be depleted when taking AP’s), Q10 and K2-vitamin amongst others. For depression I would look into herbs like lemon balm, rhodiola rosea, holy basil or medical mushrooms like chaga and reishi. Maybe try one or a couple at a time and see if anything works for you. They are relatively cheap, just make sure to buy from a reputable dealer. Herbs won’t make your life choices for you, but they might make it easier to make the right choices."

I just don’t want them to suffer while they care for me. I just want them to live a free life and do what they want instead of spending time taking care of me. My family told me that I’m not a burden but sometimes they say things are contradictory to this statement. I know they don’t mean it, and they’re just saying this because they feel bad. I just want my family to be happy, and I just think me getting out of their lives will solve this problem."

176141498,I’m just really scared and want to hide myself I’m feel like I’m losing my mind in the second I write this I’m not sure If I sound sane anymore
176141499,"Sending YOU hugs, too…"
176141500,"Doesn’t surprise me, i prefer it too. I just feel more comfortable talking over the phone for some reason. One thing I hated was going to the doctors office and waiting 45 minutes or sometimes longer to see the doctor, in fact I’ve never had a doctors appointment start on time. Now when they schedule to call at 3:00 but really call at 4:00 I can just relax in the comfort of my home instead of waiting in an uncomfortable chair in their office bored out of my mind."
176141501,"I checked drugs.com and the only medication I take that causes dry mouth is Zyprexa. Do you know if Canker sores come from the dry mouth? Have you experienced Canker sores taking Zyprexa? Do you just live with it, or did you change AP’s?"
176141502,I just came off them because they made me worse
176141503,Go for shopping if you have the energy. Good way to get out of the house for a good hour.
176141504,What medicine did you take if you don’t mind me asking?
174378207,I believe you had withdrawal symptoms. But if you get off it slowly you will probably be fine.
176141505,_AT_MENTION_ do you have insurance?
176141506,Can someone talk with me about autism?
176141507,As long as I am old anyways when it happens and it is not painless then I would not be afraid to die.
176141508,I was wondering about that _AT_MENTION_
176141509,I have exactly the same problems … What does your doctor say?
176141510,"Same here, I’ve heard in psychiatry ward that is one the most prescribed drug for narcotic abusers like crack, heroin and alcohol"
174378205,"I had mild akathysia on abilify 30 mg tablet. But I’m switching now to Invega, so we’ll see"
176141511,My pdoc didn’t think it was right meds in my case because of the addictive qualities
176141512,I quit smoking in 2015. It did make my symptoms worse for awhile but eventually I made it through it and now I just don’t smoke.
176141513,I found cartoons help when your feeling psychotic.
176141514,I’m paranoid sz and fought it for years. Now I welcome it as a defense.
176141515,I guess I’m important! Something to feel good about maybe? If I take another perspective? Things are good now. I’m just scared of hell.
176141516,"im sorry to hear that I wake up restless, eager to move,get out the house for a walk to wake up properly"
176141517,"No. I have my nuclear family, a few friends/acquaintances, colleagues, church people. Im horrible at being a good friend/family member/colleague, so i think i can be grateful they stick around. Sometimes they complain. I miss really having equal connections though and im not a social butterfly. I find it supertough to take initiative in social contacts, so often they slowly bleed to death."
176141518,Tea is pretty good. Even over here in the heat it’s refreshing to have a hot cup of tea in the summer. I start the mornings with a coffee but I’ll have a tea for morning tea. Good start pre lunch!
176141519,"I get that too, stuff that instantly causes me to look. Oh yeah! I ducked in the kitchen one time because I saw a bird flying at my face! I tried looking for the bird after because I thought it was stuck on top of the cupboards. Hope it’s not too long until your injection? I forgot to take my pills the other night and didn’t sleep a wink. _PERSON_ like ???? the next day and dizzy"
176141520,"I read a short story that was a work of art prosecuting a good man. The charge was neglect of the starving. The case was solid. It really made me think and, “How could I refute it?” Then I got one answer, that is, by _NAME_, singing, “I am an innocent man.” We should not condemn when we don’t understand. I will leave the prosecuting to the lawyers."
176141521,"I have something like that. It has helped to think without words or in groups of three. I think it has some thing to do with some thing like Ethernet, a broadcast medium."

176141525,I rarely answer my phone unless it’s a family member calling because I know they don’t call except in an emergency. We just text. Anyone else can just leave a message.
176141526,"All the AP’s weaken me physically, but the atypical AP’s condition my mind just about right. At least Geodon and Seroquel do. All the typical AP’s dull my mind so much. Life is very dull and uninteresting."
176141527,"I was too depressed to have an adolescence. My high school years i was too stoned to grow up. I’m still just learning! People are in the here and now just reacting to you. they want to have fun. I don’t really do social interactions but I’m married, have a friend or two. And just take life as it comes- not all good but i don’t waste my time with people who laugh at me. But even they are ground for some growing."
176141528,Lmao nothing like that I got this pinpoint pressure feeling on the tip of my cartridge feels like it’s going to explode but it won’t and it’s stuck In that stage… feels like torture but it’s been reducing like crazy lately
176141529,It sure does. Feels nice.
176141530,Same here. I’ve heard other people say the same thing.

I grew up with Daft Punk, Air, Mr _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I:cube, and so on. (Of course i have been inspired by so many bands like Portishead… I can’t quote them all.) Here a song I composed when I was 20, inspired by french touch music :"
176141534,Congrats man
176141535,I’m a major _PERSON_ head! my mother collects _NAME_ memorabilia and we have a whole room in the house dedicated to just _NAME_ collectibles! My whole family goes every other year to Disney World and Universal Studios because they have a huge _NAME_ Wizarding World theme park section in both Universal Parks! It’s amazing!
176141536,"Yes. I quit efexor and zoloft. Especially the efexor was a hellish withdrawal, also because they said there werent withdrawals and no need to slowly taper, but i managed. Im happy im off, and i can deal with mood issues naturally. You too can do it!"

176141540,During the good times it’s easy to forget how bad things used to be. It’s easy to forget what things were like without meds. I have to constantly remind myself of the signs and symptoms so that I will stay on my meds and take care of my mental health. When my meds are working so well it’s easy to think I’m not sick and let my guard down. In the past it’s led to many times of me stopping my meds. But thankfully I’ve learned over time what will happen if I go off them. This website helps me with my insight because I see reminders of my illness everyday. Do you ever struggle with your insight?
176141541,"Just say that you’ve realized that you can’t work, that you can’t take care of yourself without help, and you can barely leave the house. I’m lucky that I get out of bed, though meds help. The farthest I travel is to my computer, to my dr, and to the grocery store when absolutely necessary. Does any of this match up with your situation?"
176141542,maybe we should reach out more
176141543,"That’s great. I hope it lasts. I know within one dose of an AP, I am no longer obsessed with religion. I still have other issues but it works right away for my religious obsession"
174378208,"I knew I was crackers to some degree, but had no idea i was schizophrenic until my doctors wrote it on my file. That’s correct. The doctors never told me I had schizophrenia…not one of them…I found out by reading my Hospital file."
176141544,Were other people you saw out there wearing masks or no? Where do you live?
176141545,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ You mean the shirt? It’s the only professional looking one I have
176141546,"2 weeks now. I think I’m doing good with obsessive thoughts, but today is really my first happy day so it’s kind of early to tell."
176141547,Oh that’s great! You’re lucky. Do you want your own place if you can afford it with the new job?
176141548,I have a box of herbal teas that i bought years ago and hardly used.
176141549,I thought you were young? Do you have a condition that allowed you to get it? Hope you’re better soon.
176141550,"Hey y’all, So I’ve been working on figuring out my sleep disorder. I bought some light therapy glasses. So I use the glasses for 20 mins when I wake up. Then I also take 0.25mg of melatonin 30min to 1 hour before sleep. The light therapy is to stop the melatonin and the micro dose of melatonin is what’s recommended to start the melatonin cycle. (not using melatonin as a sedative) Anyway over the past couple weeks I’ve gone from sleeping in till 12-230pm to waking up at 730-930am. But the real kicker is I actually feel alert during the day which is unheard of for me. I could force myself up early but I’d always feel like death and feel half asleep and fatigued all day in a haze till like 6-10pm. Now that’s getting fixed . I even feel like my concentration is coming back. Maybe the messed up sleep rhythm has been the culprit for that. Cheers Level"
176141551,I know it’s weird how it sticks with you isn’t it?
174378209,"They don’t give out diagnoses of schizophrenia lightly. If a doctor gave you a diagnosis then they saw something drastically wrong with you. Maybe they think something’s is odd or different in your behaviour or the way you talk or ""maybe* you might say stuff that seems odd. Maybe the doctors think your paranoid or have delusions or hallucinations. But before they label someone schizophrenic and put them on meds they usually observe the person for awhile, like weeks or even months. Sorry, I re-read your symptoms. Those show you are very ill. I hang around normal people and that would be bizzare if they thought or said those thngs. Unfortunately you’re in the same boat as a lot of other schizophrenics who cannot realize they’re sick even if it may be obvious to their family or their doctor or their friends. A doctor does not prescribe medication lightly either and it should be taken exactly as prescribed. And if ain’t helping you don’t take matters into your own hands and stop taking it. 
Tell your doctor."
176141552,I am going out to eat with my friend tomorrow.
176141553,They know nothing they all want to kill me i’m Born with gods in my mind

176141555,Hope you feel better soon… sorry to hear you had a rough day? _AT_MENTION_
176141556,I think my pills were 1000mg . I took 2 sarcosine and 2 N-Acetyl Cysteine. It was part of their dual formula.
176141557,_AT_MENTION_ Thank you for sharing your story! I’m waiting to hear back about disability.
176141558,I get like 10 minutes with my psychiatrist but I see her every 3 weeks.
176141559,"Right, sorry about that. I’m in the US, got diagnosed in my late teens, and the medicine I take is Haldol. Been working hard on recovering. I think I’m making some headway. Tough illness to fight. I guess it’s hard to fight an invisible illness."
176141560,How did you stop it?
176141561,Hopefully you’ll be able to keep 10mg.
176141562,Very good
176141563,"i’m doing ok… i watched “boss level” with dad today, was fun movie… now i’m waiting for din dins to arrive… mum ordered chinese fuds so i’m looking forward to that =D"
176141564,it helps. i take it for depression. its not magical or anything but its kind of pulled me up a bit from the depression. i still get alot of intrusive thoughts and have some bad days but the lows are not as bad now. im on the lowest dose and dont want to really increase
176141565,Anybody living in your house should count. That makes four people. It sounds like you and your husband make 28k or less. That means you should qualify.
176141566,"Ok! Thanks for all the advice. Tomorrow I plan to get moving. Will go to see my psychiatrist, attend an art class session, buy a new lightbulb, and find a new pcp."
176141567,Should I throw away my food first then eat it?
176141568,I searched for schizophrenia message boards when I needed help and this was the only one with constant new posts. Other boards had like days between posts.
176141569,Just try to have hope.
176141570,Yeah there’s a touch of grandiose in it but really I just want to find out if the voices were real so I can move on wml.
176141571,_AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ Whats the craziest you did?
174378210,"Saw pdoc . He’s changed my dx to schizoaffective based on a history of mood symptoms. He said I was in remission , but then mentioned 10-15% breakthrough symptoms to the student that was sitting in on the appointment . He mentioned about stopping the depot. I said ‘no’ as I wasn’t sure if I’d deteriorate off meds/have been better off on regular meds. Also remission is not the same as recovery. He’s agreed to move me onto a 3 monthly depot, which is what the depot nurse was pushing for. He tested for tremor and cogwheel rigidity (Well got the student to do that). I had to make my arm go floppy , something I find very hard to do. There’s apparently a mild degree of both. My stepdaughter did say part of the reason I’m doing better is that I’m near support, which I wasn’t in Essex."
176141572,"I find negative thinking is related to depression. So by fighting depression I think less negative. I try to excersise twice a week, walk for a minimum of 30 minutes each day. Take anti-depressive natural supplements like vitamin-D and bacopa monniera. And be social when I can with family, friends and colleagues."

176141578,"Sunday night I drank, and woke up the next morning SO hungover. I’m talking throwing up all morning, sweats, all of it. I had to wait to take my meds to make sure I could keep them down. Well after a few hours when i woke up, it literally felt like I was tripping or something. I had tracers when I’d move my hands or arms, I kept seeing patterns on the ceiling, the floor, the counter…everything looked distorted. and then i took a shower. I had a complete detachment from reality. I was having extremely bad auditory hallucinations, voices talking and whispering, sounds like buzzing and like someone was in the room with me, I had to keep checking to see if anyone was there. It got to point where what I was hearing and experiencing was so overwhelming. I had a panic attack and had to sit with my friend for like 30 minutes. I haven’t had an episode like this for a long time. usually stress is my biggest trigger, and it was my last day to get all my things moved out of my house because i’m movin

176141584,"Hmm. Diet & Exercise Is An Interesting Topic To Me. I Walk Usually Daily. But!, I Have Much Energy These Days. Now, In My Past A Few Years Ago I Gained Some Weight. Never Was Overweight When I Was A Kid. Or Young Adult. As A Kid I Played Sports, & Listened To, And Played Music. As A Young Adult I Got A Construction Job And Was Doing Healthy Activities Every Day, For A Couple Of Years. Then!, After I Got Hit With The Illness, I Didn’t Eat Much, And Kinda Wavered Between Gaining Jus A Little Bit Weight, And A Month Later Losing Some Weight. But!, During Those Times After The Illness Struck Me Hard & I Tried Reaching Out Into The World, About 10 Years After The First Diagnosis, I Gained A Good Amount Of Weight And _PERSON_ Every Single Hopeless Day. I Was Severely Depressed. Lost. And Sad. And Kinda Used Food As A Form Of Escape. I Didn’t Have To Think About How Lonely I Was. Or Try To Understand The Reasons Of The Illness, Life & Death.

appealing to me anymore. i would just be alone in my later years, and i worry i would lose my faculties, maybe not, and maybe i’ll regain my interest for life but going to talk to my pdoc about it, next time i talk to him."

176141622,Of course! I’ve worked in 6 or 7 restaurants; my first job when I was 17 was as a dishwasher in a family oriented restaurant. The best part of working in a restaurant is discounts on meals or free meals and taking or sneaking food.

176141627,I take the pills too. They work great.
174378225,I have been dealing with it for most of my life currently im actually in my late 30’s and just beginning to finally put the pieces together I’ve been “different” and “weird” my entire life for a lot of the things I’ve seen listed as symptoms. I don’t know that I have issues with telepathic communication to the point that it requires denial I feel like it is often that I am able to pick up thoughts or transmit them to others subconsciously evident in constantly being told “that’s exactly what I was thinking” or going to say however im not sure if it is simply based on my ability to read nonverbal ques and assess them I’m really nervous about seeing a doctor about it and getting medicated only to be mentally chemically castrated because my opinions don’t fit the mold
176141628,Yeah depression is probably my biggest issue. I take a lot of effexor which works well but sometimes I might miss a dose stupidly when I get out of routine. Boy do I feel that quickly. That depression really is unsettling and it’s not easy to deal with. I’m glad you got out of it and feel more normal.
176141629,hi i’m a new user my name is antonino and i’m italian. from 15 to 16 i took risperidone. I read on askpatient that it can have quite adverse effects. who among you like me took it as a minor? before it for a few months I took xanax and then sertraline changing psychiatrist gave me risperidone. what side effects did you have? I haven’t been taking any medications for years now. I had so much sleepiness as the main effect of the drug plus depersonalization and demotivation. Am I too new to write private messages? I am excited to be here in this exciting forum
176141630,I studied abroad in Galway. Lots of weed and drinking and going to pubs. I didn’t get a chance to study till the last few weeks before exams.

174378231,"Did you get your Magnesium glycinate.I’ve been reading how much Mg is used from Mg oxide and Mg citrate.Citrate provides more Mg absorbed,but it has laxative (too laxative) for me.Did you find somewhere how much Mg is absorbed from glycinate?I took 600mg of citrate last night and this morning was disaster.I don’t have opportunity to find Mg glycinate anywhere.While been on clozapine,citrate at that doses didn’t cause me any effect,but Being on Risperdal,I’ve already have problems alone without Mg."
176141632,I’ve had that happen before. It’s auditory hallucinations. Generally they happened to me if I had a bunch of caffeine or if I had too much energy. My advice is try to calm yourself down to prevent it from turning into a bad situation. You also might want to get your hearing checked out as it is also related to that.
176141633,Today I studied Buddhism. I went to pick up a job application with my brother. I did a painting. IMG_20210322_1029023840×5120 2.51 MB

176141640,It’s just an odd feeling. An odd familiar feeling slowly creeping up of what I felt like when I first became psychotic. My former roommate almost drove me there. It was incredibly stressful living with him. We both drove each other crazy on occasion but he was one of the several people I’ve met in my life who knows he can bug you but he doesn’t know when to stop. Luckily he moved out but I have no doubt that if he had lived here another three of four months I would have had a major relapse.
176141641,Yeah. I agree to a certain extent. Still. Paranoia can make you do strange defensive things. I get you before you get me type behavior. You still know what is right but the threat is there in the disturbed mind. No one wins with violence.

176141647,"I’ve been running and walking on the treadmill. Walking on an incline gets my heart pumping. It’s quiet so my parents don’t get woken up by the sound of me bouncing up and down. I also jog on an incline, I do an HIIT session, where I’ll stop and go and stop and go. I now run HIIT for “effort” as “speed” is a less clear-cut word to represent what I want to do, to help foliate my brain centers, via activating “neurogenesis” (a state of brain grow, and repair) via exercise …, imo feasibly the best way to trigger this. MY NEW HIIT APPROACH ~Warm up for a few minutes (light running with proper form to get warm) ~Dynamic warm up drills ~Start at low medium speed 4mph ~Continue at TEMPO speed of ~5mph ~Put incline at 4% - 6% ~Vary speed for short times up to :15-:20-:30-60 second intervals ~Speed is run by feel, until my heart races comfortably and I breathe hard ~I never allow my form, being roughly centered, midfoot strike, and upright posture, lift knees, to break down ~After each 
injection of higher speed; completely down to my walking pace, 2.5 mph ~I run by feel ~My general approach: Avoid getting injured, Maximize “comfortably hard”, not by going hard, but by being in that state… ie “injections of effort” ~Without getting sore or feeling bad, I make sure my feet are on the treadmill, or that I’m walking around off it, for distance (run 1.5 mile), or time (run 20 min), and without fail at the end of the session, I never finish fatigued. I always finish relaxed, and feeling like I should have done more."

176141658,I don’t know it makes me ill and causes bloody discharge in my stools so I can’t take it. Quit taking it and the symptoms disappeared.
176141659,Maybe its bcz you have a bit of emotions left that others can evoke in you. Idk my gf left me when I was diagnosed and put on meds. She said I changed and wasnt the same.

176141669,"I’m working daily and feeling ok. I want to do my courses when I feel motivated. Deadlines to finish the weekly homework and quizzes are nearing. I have about five hours of work to do by next Monday. I don’t know why I signed up for two courses when I work daily. I did though. I’m not as angry today. I ate out and feel quite good for going out and breathing some fresh air. When I’m cooped up inside my apartment, my head starts imagining things that don’t exist. So far, I’m still a cog in a wheel, nothing special or almighty. This is good. When I think I’m endowed with special powers, then I become obsessed with such ideas, rather unhealthy. I am ok still. I feel ordinary and anonymous. Modesty is a virtue? I am not modest but mundane. Boring to the hilt, I feel blah and bleh continually-Blah: nothing matters; Bleh: who cares? I don’t seek excitement anymore. I’m older and calmer. Back to the grindstone, work awaits- I pause for a moment from my routine. I imagine a better life of 
doing interesting endeavors. My wasted youth frustrates me. Older, I surrender to my fate. Cog in a wheel, I am insignificant. BUT, I tread on, motivated by hunger to live and be the best that I can be. I relish my minor triumphs- plagued by insanity; I have overcome the unimaginable. I am a warrior in the minefield of cacophony, delusions, and paranoia. Aged and worn-down, I continually fight until my demise. The war is won when it is over and R.I.P."
176141670,"Thank you for your first hand thoughts on this _AT_MENTION_ . Definitely need to quit, it’s not sustainable. I should’ve read that second post of yours before.

Probably was very lucky I didn’t die since my HR rests around 120-135 with or without amphetamine. Anyway, thanks for the reply muchly."
174378245,I am staying away from porn. It makes me mentally ill. Also it reduces the libido. It’s like a person who drinks all the time becomes a alcoholic. You get resistant and then it takes even more to provoke a reaction.
176141671,I feel broken spirited when I watch the provider’s granddaughter being raised in a much more human way than I was. It is so hard to bare. Jealousy can be a very painful thing. I’m trying to just rejoice in the fact that she’s a beautiful and healthy child and keep my personal life out of it. Hard to do.
176141672,it’s cool that you have friends. I have similar feelings towards close acquaintances and family – that they are able to read my mind. Other-worldly stuff. I wouldn’t be able to hold a relationship of any kind – romantic or friendly. Can’t get over the paranoia

Went on haldol and only gained about 15 lbs per year. Tried to add abilify and gained fast. Same with Latuda. On perphenazine now and gained about 30 lbs in a year.

176141683,Vaping screwed up my teeth too
174378249,yeah they really need to address some of the negatives more often. Seems they only concern themselves with voices and whether you are going to harm yourself or somebody else. This is a real bad flaw in the system.
176141684,"_AT_MENTION_ , the first thing I said to her was that it could be a seizure or migraine. It’s scary but treatable so there’s that. My concern about sz is that the APs don’t make things go away for me so that scares me for her."
176141685,"(I think I might have made a similar thread in the past. In that case I’m sorry. ) I’ve noticed I tend to notice the voices more when I have a headache. Ever since my friend’s death, my voices have been louder and I’ve also had a headache more or less constantly. I’m not asking if voices cause headaches. I’m asking if there’s some correlation. I also get a headache if the voices are loud and I’m focusing on resisting them. So what do you think? Anyone with similar experiences?"

176141699,"I’m having all kinds of irrational thoughts surrounding my new therapist. I can sense that it could be turning delusional, but right now I have insight. I’m having ideas that she’s someone posing as a social worker/therapist. She’s actually very attractive and too good looking to be a therapist. Am I nuts or what? Don’t know if I should give it some more time or that if I should contact my psychiatrist right away. I’m getting paranoid making contact with her now. It’s too bad because she seemed to be very understanding over the phone. Hopefully these twisted thoughts will go away. I am not divulging a lot because It’s too messed up.

On 50 milligrams I’ve Abilify the top should be 30 milligram but I was still hearing voices and had numerous symptoms of schizophrenia I am a paranoid schizophrenic and I only hear voices once in awhile now should I stay on 50 milligram or should I ask my doctor to lower me to 30 because that is the tops
176141713,I’m sorry that happened to you.
176141714,I’m sorry you are having a rough time. ((Hugs))
176141715,I get my meds free here in Canada.
174378256,Once I got on abilify my symptoms have been stable/the same for 6 years.
176141716,I never relapsed. I just stayed as sick as always when my pdoc switched meds. It was only when he started adding meds is when I started getting better.
176141717,"When the clues are hard to ignore though… Like during a convo with the hubby last week, I was thinking about the word capsaicin while he was telling an unrelated story, and in the middle of his sentence he started to say the word capsaicin. He caught himself, laughed because it was NOTHING like what he was talking about, and moved on. I immediately go to “WHY would he have said that unless HE is ME, we’re the same person…” and it’s been like that constantly. There was a time last summer that I got stung a couple times by a wasp in the chest while outside smoking. I came in to assess the damage, and there were red marks, but then at that moment my daughter broke out into massive hives on her chest and back. The doc told us likely some type of allergic reaction, but she has no allergies… Every time I get sick or feel run down or sore (I have fibro and arthritis) one of the 3 of them do also in a similar way. Like a few months ago, my husband had a seriously painful impacted wisdom tooth 
removed. Last month, the same exact wisdom tooth of mine had to be extracted for the same reason. Maybe mine started to get bad/painful a few months ago and I just imagined it was him and he had to have it removed because I was in so much pain, and just didn’t get around to the extraction until last month… There are SO many little clues lately. I’ve been going down the rabbit hole guys, like far and often, it hasn’t been this bad in years"
176141718,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I have got through worse. It’s just when so many things happen at once I don’t cope too well with it

Resolving racism, _USER_ID_, sexism, etc. Women in support groups seem much more approachable in general than the men, except for a few gentlemen. We have seafood cities in Hawaii and that’s too much for me to stomach so I can’t exactly flatter a guy who eats that stuff… in general I’m afraid of anyone who does drugs, doesn’t respect consent, and I guess I have a slight preference for cute-type local Asians than Asians from China even though I’m not “strong sexy” or anything… every time I friend a guy from the mi system, it doesn’t work out. In fact I don’t know much about guys in general. They don’t talk as much as women do, mostly. But I’m aging and I’m not looking for money anymore.

I am trying to substitute it for inorganic vitamins and minerals (it’s an organic chelated vitamin / mineral supplement) but this might be a losing battle. Might have to get back on DEN. I don’t like this because it fosters too much dependence on that company. Like my whole well-being is then based on that supplement. What if they go under?

I never lie, but said things like “that is from a less happy time in my life” (first date, very intrusive and upsetting, didnt know what to say) or “i will tell you later” (boyfriend). If someone would ask now i would say i dont want to talk about it. Unless i know someone well enough, then they can hear the story. It is for you to decide. Never feel obliged to tell, nor obliged to make something up…just what you feel best about. And maybe you will also be less self-aware of it in a while."

As you watch it meander lazily downwards, its path seems random and aimless, as though whim and fancy were dictating its every move. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. For when you examine the matter more closely, you begin to see that every aspect of the leaf’s descent is determined by innumerable causes. Whim and fancy never enter the picture at all. The structure, mass and aerodynamic properties of the leaf; the height of the tree; the surrounding air temperature, humidity and pressure; the presence of a breeze; the strength of the earth’s gravity; the friction between the leaf’s surface and the air molecules- all of these elements, and more, combine to determine the leaf’s precise path. There is not a single aspect of its journey, no matter how insignificant or minute, which is not fully determined by its causes."" excerpt from The Wisdom of The Infinite by _NAME_"

I’ve been on Geodon and Seroquel for over a decade, and though they didn’t make me sleep, they did control my symptoms with minimal side effects. It could be that coming off Zyprexa has disrupted your sleep. Also, maybe you could get some nicotine gum or some nicotine patches to get you through this difficult time. Coming off nicotine I’m sure is distressful. I don’t know. It’s your decision. I wish you the best. It’s nice to know that you’re fighting to get well. As for the Trazodone, it works for some people and not for others. Fifty milligrams of Trazodone puts some people into a deep sleep for twenty hours. Sometimes that sounds good to me.

Ask a slave, “Do you want to actually do what you’re doing?” and the answer would be, no. Ask people that question who ‘work’ and see if they can answer it with total honesty and with a resounding YES - and you would have to lie to yourself to think anyone would be telling the truth if they DID say yes. It makes zero sense to tie ‘morality’ to ‘work’ when you consider what’s happening on the planet in relation to many subjects where morality is ACTUALLY needed and when the jobs that most do will be replaced by robots ANYHOW. (REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT ONE) That means the idea of it being moral is a social construct and not a legitimate universal unchanging idea/truth. It has no heart in it. The truth is that love is more important and in our world today, it is nearly dead. People exchange truth and love for comfort and lies, for convenience, for apa

So, with that said, in our world today, work is considered ‘moral’ because its a social construct that is conveniently adopted over the harsh truth that most people are in denial about how they really feel about the state of their life and their desires. And oddly, they only give the successful celebrities or the like a pass whom they project those qualities they would like to have in themselves and then turn their backs on anyone in their family who might want the same. In short, the world is FULL of liars. DON’T BE FOOLED. We all want the freedom of doing what we want; there is no shame in it, because it is a universal desire. If anyone says they like work its because it’s ‘the easy way out’. It’s much easier than owning your true desires and your true self and face the harshness of being on the receiving end of 
hate from people who are actually jealous of someone who gets to do what they want, and they wish they would give themselves the freedom to do/have."

176141853,"It is a good idea to practice humility. We don’t know everything. If you feel what your doctor is doing for you works you should trust them, just don’t expect them to say that you can stop taking meds any time soon. I had to put my life in my doctors hand a couple of years ago, and it involved taking more meds. I believe I would have died if I didn’t trust my doctor and take the medication. People never stop learning things. I’m in my 40’s and I do lack insight into certain aspects of my life still. I think it is very common for people to make theories based on their limited knowledge and somehow believe that they know what’s best for themselves even if there are experts, like doctors that obviously knows a lot more about diseases and medication. I have done it, and I’ve been wrong on several occasions. Luckily I’m learning from my mistakes. That’s not to say you should blindly follow advice from professionals, but you gotta weigh in their expertize before making a assumption."

176141860,"I’ve tried a lot of supplements. The two that have worked well are Sarcosine and Amyloban 3399. I notice that I’m missing a bit of an edge cognitively without my Sarcosine. The Amyloban has allowed me to reduce my AP – Geodon – down to a maintenance dose. I take both with my doctor’s supervision. With the Amyloban 3399, one pdoc agreed that it worked, tried some other patients on it, and found it worked for between 1/3 to about 1/2. Some reported it increased their discomfort. In my own case I find my positive symptoms get worse when I stop the Amyloban. Usually within a week or two and I have to up my AP dose. It also doesn’t replace my AP, I need to take my lower dose of Geodon with it. I don’t know why, but it’s this specific brand that works. Trying to swap out a cheaper mushroom product has failed every time. Maybe _AT_MENTION_ can tell you why that is, I just know that it is. Finally, the Amyloban has really helped with pain from nerve damage in my neck, shoulders, and back (i
njury from my youth). I had been prescribed Vicodin for pain management. Was able to step down to Tylenol on the Amyloban. When I’m off it the pain becomes unmanageable within a month. This was a completely unexpected benefit. I’ve been on it long enough that we know it’s not placebo effect. Have the backing of a few doctors in continuing to use it now and they’re telling their patients to try it. I’ve tried a lot of other stuff like mega Niacin doses, fish oil, etc., and it didn’t work at all. Sarcosine and Amyloban 3399 are the standouts for me. Hope this helps."

174378291,"_AT_MENTION_ Okay. I am going to do something REALLY brave, so you know you are not alone. I don’t know how much you weigh (and I am not trying to pressure you to tell me), but I got all the way up to 319 pounds after Geodon and Abilify. I looked HUGE: That is me with my sister. She was always the popular one, always doing very well socially, always doing things with friends…I always envied her. I especially felt that I didn’t measure up to her when I weighed THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN FREAKING POUNDS. I immediately went to the pdoc and got off Abilify. We switched to Haldol because it is supposedly weight-neutral. Abilify and Geodon were both supposed to be too. But not for me. I didn’t change much about my eating, but after going off the Abilify, I lost down to 270 just naturally. I think Abilify was just a bad med for me, it surely doesn’t do that to everyone. But I was unlucky with that one. Then I looked like this, last December, a little better around 270: _NAME_ AND _NAME_.jpg 1024×57
6 43.3 KB When my pdoc wanted to put me back on Zyprexa back in January of this year, I fought her for a couple of months because I didn’t want to regain that weight. So finally, when my quality of life got so bad that I was in bed 18 hours a day and leaving the house only once a week for 1-2 hours, I agreed to try the Zyprexa. I went back to Sparkpeople.com and started using the nutrition tracker again, planning my meals out a week in advance and never going over 1400 calories a day. I needed to be accountable, to be sure I was keeping my goals. It’s working. I went from 268 on March 13 to 235.5 as of last Saturday. That’s 32.5 pounds lost in six months, not bad! I am not exercising, just limiting my calories to under 1400. I don’t go on food binges anymore, but I am satisfied with what I eat. I am rarely hungry, and when I do get hungry, I crunch raw vegetables. I can give you other suggestions on how to stay under 1400 calories if you want. You can do it too. I know you can. I am willing to do it w
ith you if you want. If you join Sparkpeople to help you out, I am also SHMOOKITTY there.

It’s just a really good place to be. Two months ago, I went through my pantry and took all the fattening foods like macaroni and cheese and pudding, and all the things like soups that I never eat anymore, and donated it all to the food bank. They were thrilled to get it - it was all name

174378309,"I know this is tl;dr but oh well. Hello. I have schizophrenia. Catatonic schizophrenia. Schizoaffective disorder. I have that. One of the things I suffer from is not being able to move my body for a while and then returning to being able to move my body. So I experience paralysis and the inability to use my talents or move my body. I always feel a pressure in the back of my head and then I get tired and I can’t do the thing I want to do. It goes in and out all day as a routine. Usually this makes it impossible for me to live the way I want to live. I can’t do my homework most of the time because I literally can’t control my body to do it. In 2010 I flunked out of school because of this In 2019 had just graduated from college and got a job and a full scholarship to more college. I still experienced bouts bouts of not being able to move or do work or do what I want to do.some of my choices just don’t come out. So I went into my new life of full time job and scholarship and I was just about to 
break down again. I wanted succeed instead so deeply I decided to accept that I had schizophrenia just in case by accepting it I could treat it and succeed. One day I accepted that I had schizophrenia just before everything was going to go downhill again and I for the first time volunteered to go to out patient services instead of my family forcing me to go. I not only took the medicine but I agreed to actually see if it worked or not. I also searched the internet for any over the counter medication I could find. Because no matter how much medicine I take I never am able to beat my avolition or catatonia or paralysis or whatever word should be used for not being able to use my talents. Not being able to do tasks. Freezing and literally not being able to move my body. I tried glycine because of the internet suggesting it I was just randomly taking something from the vitamin shoppe i didn’t expect what happened next. Ilater on I felt the paralysis overcoming me and I knew I wasn’t going to be able to move. 
Then I went to move and it worked! Glycine actually helped me move my body! I then tried alpha lipoid acid,NAC, sarcosine, and l theanine and it all actually helped me move my body and complete tasks. When I used to be doing things what would happen is I would just stop and not be able to continue because I just couldn’t move. But when I take these medicines I can move. It’s kind of sad that the psychiatrists and doctors and nurses that deal with mental health didnt prescribe this to me. The problem is how much of the medicine I have to take to have a full productive day. I have a day where I’m taking all this medication just so I can move my body when I want to move it. It’s pretty sad but it’s a step up from failing out of school and getting fired from work. I am working full time and I am going to school full time. I would have crashed from not being able to move my body when I wanted to unless I found all these medicines. Now I have to pay for all these medicines, take a large amount of it and t
hen function properly. But ‘its better than no solution at all and watching the next medicine the doctor give me not do anything for my movement problems. The medicine I am on is invega sustenna and wilburtin. The question is will the over the counter miracles keep working for me? And how do I tell my doctor that this has been happening correctly? Does anyone else suffer from catatonic schizophrenia or catatonia and not being able to move at certain times or control their body to move. What medication over the counter or prescribed by a doctor do you take that you feel treats this?"

Then she always wants what she wants, like a child, and doesn’t take kindly to limits and boundaries. She plays guilt trips and says mean things and hangs up on me. She never remembers though. She doesn’t remember who I am. I’m just someone who calls her to check up on her, some random voice on the phone. She always wants to know if I moved things at her house, or rearranges things, she’ll do stuff and not remember doing it. Then in the mornings sometimes she’s pretty clear headed. The other morning she said she was going to start writing things down because she thinks she’s forgetting things and she’s scared. She said things are always in different places when she gets back from the store like someone else has been in her house b
ut that doesn’t make sense so she must be doing it and forgetting and that scares her that she’s losing her mind. I feel so bad for her.

I generally try to set a no more than one hour doing homework unless there’s a big project or exam. As far as I can help them, I do. Pre-cal and chemistry they are on their own lol."
176141940,"Sometimes I feel like I’m out of place as if I don’t belong (in this world). I don’t feel that way at the moment. Those type of thoughts sometimes linger. It may be partly due to the isolation or loneliness that comes with some mental illnesses. Nobody here hates you, or at least I don’t _AT_MENTION_ . The only advice I can give on that right now is to try not to give those thoughts… much thought heh. Like don’t overthink it. Otherwise you give those thoughts power and then they seem more real. Not everyone hates you"

176141950,I was diagnosed at 38. I’m nearly 50 now. Once I got on the right med I was psychosis free and stable. Getting on the right med for you is the key. It doesn’t matter what age you are.

174378324,"I bought the stuff because I came across a site saying it cured schizophrenia and then I read like 100 posts in this thread so that motivated me to try it. I’m on week 4 with the stuff and it definitely improves my concentration, learning, reading, and thinking skills within minutes of taking it. I have amyloban 3099 and I have lions mane mushroom and I take both daily. Really effective natural herb at increasing focus concentration reading thinking and learning. I definitely am taking a lot of new over the counter vitamins and amino acids that’s helping me with my negative symptoms. So I don’t know if the improvement is from the lions mane and the amyloban 3099 but I do know the improved concentration and focus is from it. I am also improving on my negative symptoms deeply. Especially my inability to do tasks. That’s the main thing I’m fighting in schizophrenia. I want to be able to do things. Since I get immediate results from taking it I was wondering what the max amount you should tak
e in one day? Like what is over dosing? What is the too much line? I take 2000mg of lions mane a day. And then I take to amyloban3099 pills later on in the day or at the same time. Because it is. Mushroom can you take as much as you want? Are there overdosing consequences? I need to know for safety reasons. If you reply to me please tag me to so I can be notified of the reply because this is a big thread"

176141956,_AT_MENTION_ I’m just very happy in my increase of Invega from 100mg to 150mg has helped me to be stable. I have problems with alcohol and with weight gain. I seem to be stable with these Meds. Better than I was.

176141959,"I was at my grandmother’s funeral and several family members seriously insulted me that I live off my mom’s and said that I am careless and lazy because I don’t have a job. I tried to mention that I am heavily medicated with antipsychotics but they said that does not matter and I shouldn’t be a burden to my mom. I’m gonna talk with my pdoc tomorrow about moving to a care home and what documentation I need. My mom does not want to let me go, but I think the rest of the family is right."

I’m trying to exert myself as little as possible today, although I did wash some dishes say maybe more than an hour ago. Of course, I’m using music to help get me through, as well. But, I’m still not getting enough sleep at night, either. At least it’s not hitting me as hard as Dad’s death did more than 9 years ago."
176141961,I’ve been on it for 6 years. It raised my blood sugar and I was prescribed metformin to counteract that. So get blood tests every 6 months to keep an eye on things. It increased my anxiety but I’m able to handle that with just supplements (broccoli sprout extract and L-theanine)

176141966,Hey _AT_MENTION_ . You have your kids and they think the world of you. Christmas is a bad time for many people. It’ll be January soon. A new year. New possibilities.
174378330,"No, my first diagnosis is anxiety."
176141967,Stress in combination with some other illness is probably bad. But still what if we think it is counter-intuitive and use it for the betterment. It gives a whole new perspective and makes us feel little better about the stress actually.
176141968,"It could be low blood sugar, eat or drink something with sugar. Like a candy bar or a big glass of orange juice, then wait about 30 minutes for it to absorb into your system… When my blood sugar is low I feel like total crap, and it sometimes does feel similar to the symptoms of an anxiety attack. When I feel that way I test my blood sugar, if it is normal I know it is anxiety. When my blood sugar is high I don’t have any symptoms other than peeing a lot. You can buy a blood sugar tester (a glucometer) at the pharmacy."
174378332,"I was interested in a particular disorder in psychiatry, but I can’t say I was interested in it as a whole. I was interested in OCD because I had it, but also because it runs through my family like wildfire; just in my family alone, three out of four kids have it, and pretty severe too. Though, now thinking about it, I was a little bit interested in schizophrenia as a child due to the fact that a someone from my church had it. I just never expected that it would happen to me."
176141969,You seem to want to attack everyone on the forum today. Are you having a bad day?

176141992,"The house just shook for some 10 seconds. This is definitely not a hallucination, even my brother has felt it shake a few times back when he still lived here. It’s been a long while since I’ve felt it shake. I don’t live in a geologically active region, there is no mining going on nearby, there is a railway some 3-4 minute walk away from here but I can hear the train when it is passing by. I wonder what could cause the the house to shake? I haven’t asked anyone else, but I assume it’s not just this apartment that was shaking."
176141993,"I was naive, of course diagnosis matters, especially if you were diagnosed as a child."
176141994,"I was once alone as well, until I got on medication. I have no friends, just family. I made the tiniest effort to reach out to my family and now I see them when I can, and they understand my illness. I have tried making friends in the past but they always drop me as soon as I start talking. Apparently my behavior is creepy. I don’t care anymore, because I know my family is large and they have my back, even when I try to isolate myself. Long story short, you should at least make an effort to socialize, be it family or friend."
176141995,"Abilify was good for my psychosis, 20mg was as good as 4mg Risperdal."

176141997,"It was difficult for me to decide. I voted auditory. Though if I could go back I might vote for visual. I haven’t experienced many visual hallucinations other than dark shadows, spiders, and the likes and yeah they were terrifying for sure, it’s just that I’ve suffered more auditory hallucinations and they’ve really had me fearing for my life before. To the point where I was laying on the floor afraid to move."
176141998,"i ate breakfast i feel little better,"
174378337,"I’ve thought of trying to be a counselor to people, but I think the works more suited to people who have more positive symptoms and I’m only really experiencing weak motivation, some very mild hallucinations every now and again. I don’t think I’d have the vigor to really struggle with helping someone whom would need it or the experience with coping with symptoms that are way worse then what I have. Still, its an option that I might look into, if I ever want to re enter the work sphere."
176141999,"Damn so like a med that doesn’t work but you can’t come off it?? That’s odd, all four of my meds I can’t come off but that’s because they’re effective and keep me put together in one piece. It would suck to be stuck on a bad med."
174378338,"Welcome. I think it is always an experiment. I hated it, this person i know loves it. The most pronounced issues in me: Start up trouble In me it was the med with the most physical side effects. Sleepiness, weight gain, hormonal stuff, etc. I suspect it permanently changed my metabolism. In withdrawal i was better to be avoided. Rages, suicidality. But. It did kill my anxiety and delusions as good as haldol. I hope it does that for you."
176142000,"It’s all randomness in this life. Good people die young…asshats win the lottery…etc. But I still believe the good you do today, will come back to you in spades tomorrow. It’s probably a naive outlook, but being hopeful is a positive way to go about your business, I figure."

176142002,I swear i nearly died on this med
176142003,"I was very quickly labelled with drug induced psychosis on a similar road to what you tread. They didn’t diagnose me with sz until a few years later. I walked around with pretty much untreated psychosis for nearly a year. You have to present with it for more than 6 months here to get a diagnosis. I can appreciate how difficult it must be to have them fussing over what to call it. I would ignore all this. The important thing is that you get on the right treatment plan for whatever illness the doctor thinks, not the therapist. I had a therapist for a long time, and even at one point she refused to let me see the doctor after I had an appointment cancelled. She was wrong to do that, and I complained about her. I got the treatment I deserved after that, and continue to benefit from it. I guess what I am trying to say is that you need to not put much stock in your therapist when it comes to diagnosis. That’s entirely the doctors domain, and the therapist needs to accept the diagnosis. Be careful abo

And ‘the spirit of an alive person’ told me that if I don’t escape from there then my throat will close up,… As time went by, my throat started to actually feel like it was closing up. I was very very unwell… And maybe my throat wasn’t actually physically closing up, idk, but for sure, I was mentally extremely stressed and I wonder if it could have caused physical problems had it gotten more severe, due to the shock and stress levels."

176142027,"I guess I was different from a young age, but it only became particularly noticeable when I went to prep school at 8 . The ASD has always been there. It just took a very long time for it to be recognised . Pinpointing when the mental health problems started is much more difficult . Overt signs , i.e those I could sense myself , started just before I was 14 . More subtle signs I can’t say . Be it ASD and/or SMI I don’t think, unlike some/many here , there has been a clear dividing between ‘normal’ and ‘not normal’ . For/some the difference is quite dramatic . For me it was much more subtle ; not so much going straight from white to black but more a gradual shifting from one to the other ."

174378352,Its the best med for negative symptoms from my experience and from what my psy said but I just couldn’t live with the side effects destroying my life permanently from high debts caused by gambling and shopping addictions. I lost all my 15 000$ that I had in the bank and lost the 80 000$ that I made from bitcoins by being impulsive in my decisions because of Abilify. It also made me easily angry and irritated. I fight with my parents for no reason.
176142041,"Yeah, I don’t know if accommodations are made for them but I know I was told to learn what they want and work that way because they need to do things their way the same way every time they work. But it’s hard to do that without communication. It just ends up being high stress."

But it was definitely less sedating and less depressant than haldol. And i have heard good stories from those who tolerate it well. I dont think anybody knows what causes psychosis…I personally believe there are many routes to the same outcome. Did your mum get psychotic in menopause? I read some women do get late onset psychosis because the protection of “female” hormones (estrogen) falls away. Dont know enough about it though."

I didn’t have that much of a problem making friends when I was younger. It was more when I was a teenager. But didn’t really have problems finding a boyfriend. I always wanted to have a boyfriend because of unwanted attention from men I don’t like. Still have the same problem.
176142045,"i think its normal. Its more about interest in the movie if anything. I don’t get engrossed by films because I don’t really care about films. but I can disappear into a world of math questions and wonder why 2 hours went by so quick. Thats because I’m quite interested in it. but if you have trouble focusing on anything, then thats likely a result of the illness. I do get periods of that for sure."

176142058,"Usually,the psychosis takes place and it is possible that the person has an affair with a girl,courtship or newly married …etc If you know what psychosis is,you have try to imagine the results of the different conditions; 1-The person is in love with a girl and is excessively wooing her,hopping that she will take care of him while she does not feel attractive about him,and finally she wants him to stop bothering her while he do not care 2-A person is in love with a girl and she is,and there is another girl who does not want that relationship and she wants the person for her 3-A girl falls in love with a young man,and the young man does not care In sums,what is happens for both of the person and girl if the psychosis occurs to any of them what is the changes or the symptoms that arise if the psychosis occurs to the young man or the girl ?"

176142063,"I have mixed opinions on it. In the hospital, if someone is acutely agitated and literally attacking themselves or other people, I do believe in using medication on that specific occasion to help them calm down, because sometimes people literally cannot calm down on their own and to leave them in that state is cruel. Now if it is long term treatment? No I do not believe in forcible medication. I think it is fine to put in a court order saying if you don’t take your meds you can’t leave the psych hospital, but everyone should have a choice whether or not to take something that can potentially give such severe side effects long term. Some of the meds i have tried i cannot even imagine what it would be like if i was forced to stay on them. Torture."

It’s rewarding and it’s hard work but that is an end in itself. With covid I tried to at least go for a jog or a ride everyday.

I don’t have as required meds.

176142108,"It was too much for me…I had to leave. I think part of it was the Prozac. I am pretty sure I just about had a depressive episode, and they thought I was withdrawing from drugs which complicated things further. So I didn’t have as much a drug problem as I thought. So I’m wondering if I should keep taking 20mgs of Prozac in the morning, because its making me lose weight or if I should stop taking it or what. I can’t tell if its helping or not or if its going to make me more prone to manic episodes I’m ready to give up on it all. So frustrated that I can’t explain how difficult it is to have schizophrenia and depression/or lack of motivation. Lack of emotions. Not really “depression” not really anything, just confusing to me. If I hadn’t been on Prozac I may have not freaked out and got emotional in rehab. But it still wasn’t right for me. The depression came because I hadn’t slept, and it came on suddenly. But it didn’t go away until I took the Abilify. My parents keep saying 
take the Prozac because I guess they liked the manic me. It definitely made me feel great on the first day, but then I was in rehab I was hallucinating, seeing trails in the shadows from my hands when I waved them, and voices, and paranoia. I also had suicidal ideation the second day I took it bu that seemed to go away. The depression is too severe. The only reason I want to keep taking Prozac is that its helping me lose weight and regulating my appetite."

176142151,"I almost wrote this 4 years ago. I have a weird problem with my car. I didn’t discover the problen until I had my car a few months. I was living in the board & care home four years ago and the parking was confusing on the street and most of the time I had to park 3 or 4 streets away. I didn’t find out the problem until after I reported my car stolen to the police. It turns out it wasn’t stolen, it was just a mistake due to the confusing parking situation. The police had come to the home to take a report and then when it turns out I just misplaced it they had examined my car for their own records or something. Then a cop pointed out to me that the VIN number (Vehicle Identification Number) on my car was different then the VIN number on my registration. Every car has this number, it’s a unique 16 digit number imprinted mostly on the inside of your drivers side door, used to identify your car. Well the cop pointed this out and I went home and checked my pink slip and the wrong number was there 
too. I was mystified. I had bought the car used and I called up the dealer and told them this about the VIN number. They had no clue that anything was wrong. My car had been originally bought new by Hertz Rent-a-Car. To make a long story short, the dealer made some calls and it turns out that some guy in Michigan was driving around in a car and his Pink Slip and registration and all his paper work for his car had the VIN number imprinted of my car on it and all my paper work had the number imprinted from his car on it. All these documents like the Pink Slip and registration and everything else are legal documents. And nobody could get in touch with that other driver. So I called the police to see what this means. They told me if I ever get pulled over by them and the officer sees that the number on the car doesn’t match the number on my insurance and registration a couple of things could happen. Number one, they could impound my car on the spot and whatever location I am at when if I got pulled over I would 
have to get out of there on my own. Number two, they might assume the car is stolen. Anyways, other stuff could happen ant it could be a huge legal problem and a huge financial problem. I tried to get this problem solved which took dozens of calls to the car dealership and the DMV and multiple trips to the DMV and dealership in person. My sister got involved to help me sort this out but pretty soon it was more than half a year later and no progress was made. It was a confusing, stressful mess and finally the car dealer just offered me a $1000 if I just left them out of it and took care of the problem myself. At the advice of my sister I took the money and the car dealer washed his hands of the whole matter. The epilogue is that the DMV lets me register my car each year since then. It’s four years later and I told several people at the DMV the problem 4 years ago and they think my car is legal and that everything’s OK. The police told me what happens if I ever get pulled over and caught with the mis-matche
d numbers. When it started it was a huge deal but now I rarely think about the situation. It freaks me out a little occasionally when I realize that I may be pulled over one day and the cops could take my car or even arrest me. The problem was so big that a car dealership couldn’t solve it and paid that thousand dollars to get rid if me. I don’t know. I’ve never heard of this problem happening to anybody else before with a VIN number. It’s just weird and I would never try to reopen this problem and try to solve it somehow. I just have to hope it’s fine with some stranger in Michigan and that things will work out."

Also, most of the time they are expensive but the June Cup is having a sale where theirs are only $6 during covid. Great company. I had to switch back to tampons for last week, though. Got my period unexpectedly and my son was being sent to a hospital 2 hours from home. The tampons at the CVS by the hospital were $5 for a small box. I used it up in a day and a half because it’s truly shark week. But a friend rescued me with 2 boxes. I was not happy going without my cup."

I burned all these drawings some time ago, when I realised none of it was real. A shame, best drawings I ever did and it was just with biro pens. I was kinda alone in this talking to the moon and seeing designs for space craft being projected across the street lights. Safe to say when they started latching onto other people and told me their thoughts, and made me think my thoughts were not safe, my brain went into a state of Tourettes trying to get people to react to my minds commentary.

The counselor here talked to him and it turns out that the “tapping” was a defective key on his computer keyboard. I came home from the park today and we had not had contact for the last three months. I used to hear loud laughter out back that sounded suspiciously like it was at my expense. But earlier in the evening he came out and apologized for the tapping. He was really friendly and seemed sincere. I thought it was a golden opportunity to make amends and turn over a new leaf and maybe get along with all my fellow tenants and we could all get along. Now, I’m trying not to do anything wrong and get along but it’s giving me a splitting headache. These walls are thin and too much crap has happened for me to forgive everything.

The olanzapine I’m not too sure is essential. Before the days of taking lamotrigine I used to need at least the 2,5mg, and when I stopped taking it, I went into a depression a week later. But now I’m thinking - if I increase the lamotrigine maybe I won’t need the low dose of olanzapine? I’m thinking of trying it - to increase my lamotrigine to 175mg and stop the low dose of olanzapine for a week and see what happens. If I’m ok then I can quit taking olanzapine.

Then they insisted I took a heavy dose of librium even though I said I wouldn’t eat it, because it makes me feel sick and I don’t drink that much. I ate the pills. Then I on the second day, paradoxically, I got abstinence” because my AD was stopped (due to libirum) and felt like hell because of Librium My hospital record says I was “drunk” and therefore got the very harsh treatment with librium and stop of my AD meds + a painful injection of vitamin B.

I volunteered for a year at my local Community House (may be called something else in your area) to get a good reputation/references. Then I was eventually able to move into paid employment. It’s just casual shifts, 2-4 hours but it allows me to be independent. Would volunteering maybe help as a first step towards independence? My volunteer job was to cook a hot lunch for people who lived in supported accommodation (homes). I made friends with some of them. They said it was the best meal of the week where they got their vitamins & greens because we cooked everything from fresh vegetables & fresh fruit. They said in the homes the food wasn’t good & the homes took all their income so they couldn’t go out for coffee or anyt

176142404,"It’s maybe just one little thought like a quote sociopath. But there are probably no others. This is a special case and you need the money , but don’t dwell on it. It will happen soon enough. My Mother who I loved was on hospice for 14 months!"
176142405,"I have been like this for a long time…my memory is bad and behavior changes.For example,one customer came in two days ago,I treated him well and he said he will be back to buy things from me,although he didn’t said which date…two days later he came,I knew him,but I treated him differently,end up having not good terms with each other even though he buy in the end"
176142406,"These are all great ideas, I think I’ll bring it all up when I talk to him again."
176142407,in my earbuds its soft of the left side by alot compared to the right… made this way or a balance issue?
176142408,"You may have saved her life, well done. The mother is in the wrong to make you promise not to call in the future, I would call again too. You’re also right to put distance between you and your friend, it sounds like you need a break from the drama."
176142409,"I’ve lost so much weight due to my neuromuscular disease. I lost weight very rapidly in a short span of time. My mom was very concerned when I dropped below 100 pounds. Thankfully, I gained 10 pounds from 45kg."
176142410,i started hearing voices many years ago but on occasion only. i saw from my parents reaction that i wasn’t well. it was a terrible letdown. i am finally now realizing that i hallucinate. _NAME_
176142411,I think values change based on self interest and circumstances all throughout a persons life.
174378465,"You are very welcome, _PERSON_. I am not into choice. It seems to me that my “choices” are vocalisations that come after unconscious decision. I am not sure what you mean by this. One cannot know the changes in the unconscious mind; that’s why its called unconscious. We can only watch the changes in the conscious reality. Most of the time we are not aware of these changes. But when something troubles us but is also not a physical threat, we can focus our awareness of the conscious mind by watching it as it changes from moment to moment. Meditation is a good stepping stone for this. In fact, my entire schizophrenic experience for the following future changed when I decided to meditate during an extreme psychosis. Once the human child is self-conscious, it can know 2 truths no matter what. I am I know that I am the first comes from the brain our body is linked to. the second comes from the formless Witness of reality which we also are. The brain is aware only of itself. The witness is aware of 
reality and aware of itself on to infinity. The witness is definable only as an existing awareness of all reality. You can think of it as God, the universe, yin/yang, collective consciousness etc but it is best not to try and fit it into symbolic thinking. No matter how negative your current is being, as long as you are conscious, you can become just the witness to watch the reality unfolding before you. It is essentially a safe existence to retreat to, to make our choices when we are confused or scared. I know this personally because I tried doing so inside a psychotic reality and the resulting effect, after some extreme fear(that was witnessed quietly) just blew my mind."
176142412,https://m.soundcloud.com/tuscanooga/flooded-with-memories-rough-draft Here’s a song I personally made that sorta falls in the indie folk chill out grieving genre ish type thing we’ve been talking about
176142413,"I read all your posts on this thread and I am glad that you have done so well. I’m not surprised that the government gave you so much crap and it exposes the bs all of us on SSDI or SSI face when we are made well enough again to function whether through the medicine, or just being lucky enough to recover on our own. I hope you keep moving forward and I thank you for your service. I was jealous of your wife for a time but now I see you deserve her because your a better man than I."
176142414,do you wanna talk about it? it’s not a good time to leave. I want to find out why you’re sick in the morning. do you have support elsewhere?

176142418,"I have given up. I am happy to just volunteer work. I was doing good in school but when my mum moved me I started doing bad in school and got bullied,isolated,lonely depressed and felt unloved n unwanted so I did bad in school. I wanted to be a dr. I would probably like being a dr or maybe I would prefer being a vet because I love animals. I would like to be a aged care worker too because I have certificate three in aged care but I would want to do it only with a few clients I feel comfortable with and who feel comfortable with me and I would want to be my own boss and have my own aged care business . Chef would be fun job I think . I can get a kick when it’s busy and stressful and actually perform well lunch rush etc. I would not want a job as a hairdresser. I love my hairdresser.she is so talented but I would not suit being one. I’ve been told I would make a great director but then I would have to learn how to assess _NAME_ my creativity etc The job I’m supposed to have would probably suit 
me beautifully if I was my own boss and only had a few clients and only ones I’m comfortable with n who are happy n comfortable with me. I think I could help some elderly but I’m not everyone’s cup of tea. I would probably hate being a lawyer. There’s a few professions I would probably be good at and love including the profession I have. I really wanted to do aged care but it’s better I’m the boss n my terms n conditions."
176142419,"I’m sza bipolar type, so i understand. Please talk to your pdoc about this. Maybe they can adjust your meds without sending you to the hospital. My pdoc is reluctant to send me and only does it when i absolutely need to go."
176142420,"(Made it 5 days without posting… deleted some things; and maybe I can keep moving forward now…) I said some stuff on a penis thread(5 days ago) and felt like there was no rectifying THAT. (Prob., the truest reason for me ‘going’)… and afterward … I also questioned what I’m capable of spouting… For brevity; I pose to fellow community members to ask me questions (if the spirit here, moves you), or toss me an accusation(s) even… And do so - TOO, if you think I merely have a guilty conscience, because I do. Making people more paranoid on gender matters, women’s rights(human rights), or making men and women trust each other any modicum less, is not the end result I want(_NAME_), or intend(_NAME_). I’m a good man, decent, and have too many examples of real happiness in my life to ‘not belong on here’ in an O.K. capacity."

176142433,Yeah there’s a lot of things that mimic sz. Chances are though your not in that category. Ask your psychiatrist. It usually is something that is self evident to most. Peace. It is really all about function. How are you doing in life? Do you hold down a job? Relationship? You think paranoid thoughts?..
176142434,Whats children of the dust?
176142436,Delusions are a real stinker. I’m so sorry to hear that you’re having trouble with voices and a delusion based on them. Please stay healthy.
176142437,"A verse: “Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!” That alone will explain that your delusion is not true. I know that it’s not good to talk about religion here, so I will tread lightly: there are couple verses you can find that counteract your delusion. Also, if you are religious, see a priest about your doubts. He can work it out for you- I’ve done that with my priest a several times."
176142438,Very true. I still rely on my parents for everything financially. We will see if I get ssi/ssdi. It would be nice to accrue savings again
176142439,"Hey, would you lower your ap if you were in pain from it? I guess i should learn how to suffer isnt it?.. Tbh, i made bad things in the past and sometimes, it feels like i cant pardon myself still… In fact, my paranoia is very sz oriented… I am in shame by it… I am paranoid even from the other ill people, from the pdocs, all related to this diagnosis… I guess i’ll be at my house still at my worst… But will i be able to overcome those shitty thoughts and feeling on my own, just with a medium dose of zyprexa? Yeah, still not believing in myself… But i tried 11 aps for the last ten years and none of them didnt help… I am on zyprexa only in order to be on my feet and be able to eat and sleep, thats the truth… I am alone tonight again… I know its a hard illness, but maybe its better to suffer in order to be sabotaged by too much meds, cause too disabling from one point, no? … and yeah, sometimes, i am in some complex, which blocks me from being happy and in shame and paranoia…"

176142471,"Harvard Health Blog – 22 Feb 18 Diet and depression - Harvard Health Blog Research has shown that what we eat matters for every aspect of our health, including our mental health, and found that a healthy diet was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing symptoms of depression. Diet is such an important component of mental health that it has inspired an entire field of medicine called nutritional psychiatry. Mind-body medicine specialist _NAME_, MD has written a superb summary of what nutritional psychiatry is and what it means for you right here on this blog , and it’s worth reading. What it boils down to is that what we eat matters for every aspect of our health, but especially our mental health. Several recent research analyses looking at multiple studies support that there is a link between what one eats and our risk of depression, specifically. One analysis concluded: “A dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of fruit, vegetables, whole grain, fish, _NAME_ oil, low
-fat dairy and antioxidants and low intakes of animal foods was apparently associated with a decreased risk of depression. A dietary pattern characterized by a high consumption of red and/or processed meat, refined grains, sweets, high-fat dairy products, butter, potatoes and high-fat gravy, and low intakes of fruits and vegetables is associated with an increased risk of depression.” I had no clue there was someone called a nutritional psychiatrist. Very cool."

There are others here and there, but that’s my main delusion. This past couple of weeks, one of the fleeting ones has blown up to the point that I can’t shake it. I’m really scared that my husband and two children are imaginary… we all (sz patients) know how clues can get out of control sometimes. There have been too many to ignore, now I’m stuck in the loop of “well if THIS happened, it MUST mean…”. And it’s been almost more devastating than my dying delusion, because my family is my whole world, I love them more than anything and can’t imagine being without them! I’m an amazing mother, and my kids are so beautiful and smart, and I’m so incredibly lucky to have had the son and daughter I always dreamed of… but what if they are all just me playing pretend…??"

176142486,"I use to take invega. It worked well for my positive symptoms but I felt zombie like on it. I think it made my negatives worse. I haven’t fully recovered on Aripiprazole though, so I think many of my negatives are directly sz related. In other words, I don’t fully blame Invega for my symptoms anymore. So, in conclusion, it worked well for positive symptoms and it might be a step down in “over medication” in your case since you are on the strongest anti psychotic. It might work for you. I guess there is no way to be sure until you try it."

This time around, I have been on the immediate offensive against weight gain from the first day I started it on March 13. I am limiting my calories to under 1400. I don’t have enough calories in the day to get into trouble with sugar! And I refuse to go over 1400 calories, I did 1800 one day and gained a full pound.

174378477,"Well, the eye floaters, blurry vision, ringing in the ears, bizarre thoughts, anxiety, fear of everything, lack of joy, and also intrusive thoughts are all very indicative of an anxiety disorder. The searching for plots and hidden meanings and delusions could be indicative of a psychotic disorder, but from just this it sounds like they are not. You’re very aware of the delusions, which makes it seem like they’re not strong enough or long-lasting enough to be a diagnosable symptom of a psychotic disorder. You need to see a doctor. This could be drug-induced psychosis, or (very likely), it could be anxiety instead."

Taking advantage of his vulnerable state, they try to convince the King that he’s in fact a vicious pimp with a life-long passion for numismatics and large, flamboyant hats. The king, however, has become psychotic and developed a grandiose delusion: voices assure him that he’s the actual King of Patrogania. At first he’s trouble believing them, but concludes that he must be suffering from complete retrograde amnesia. Is he insane? Can someone be deluded into believing what is actually true?"

Helps with cogntive focus and memory. Some people on here have suggested sarcosine. I tried some from brainvitaminz but I found it had no effect. I think brainvitaminz isn’t legit because there address is a ups address. I recently ordered sarcosine and NAC from profrontal. They look like they’re a more legit company. We’ll see if their supplements have any effect on my cognition.

I’m on 7,5 mg since around August of last year. So it’s been more than a year that I’m on a less than minimum dosis for schizophrenia.

Major distrust of people now and slowly developing agoraphobia. It’s not that they have done anything openly malicious, it’s just plain creepy. It slowly fades where i’m like “maybe life isnt so bad, theyre gone now” Then they show up and say some ominous message and leave again. Then i’m stuck peeking out windows and cleaning my computer. Silver lining is i got to meet some nicer people that can understand where i’m coming from like from like this board and subreddits about schizophrenia."

176142531,_AT_MENTION_ I’m a little confused but that’s partly because I have gotten a headache and my brain is moving slower. I think men and women can be platonic. I’m happily married with deep commitment to my vows. But I think its perfectly ok for me to communicate as a friend with people on this forum. I honestly like people as a whole and I really miss the social life I had before I got sick. I used to go out with groups all the time. Now I’m too tired most of the time and it wears me out.
176142532,"If I’m reading that right, in the long term study a group of patients who had previously been on standard of care antipsychotics switched to Lumateperone and not only didn’t get worse, but about one third reduced their symptoms by another 20% over the level they were at on the previous AP.

176142538,I got made fun of in high school for having a mustache. I didn’t have a mother so there was no one to tell me to shave it off. I was embarrassed about it so I snuck and used my dad’s gf’s Nair (hair removal cream) and left it on too long and it burned my upper lip really bad. I tried to cover it up with make up but it didn’t work so I was embarrassed about that at school. I felt ugly anyway so burning my lip didn’t help
176142539,"Initially, but it was more because the meds were sedating all areas of my life. I got into the habit of staying busy – including being busy creatively – and it’s no longer a problem for me. Also helps that I’ve aged and between that and therapy, etc., found supplements and a lower dose that work for me."

176142560,So i keep taking strattera to distract myself from not wanting to be on the Aristada Injections. And I am just masking reality from myself. I want to escape. I know that leaving home is not rational. The walls are literally closed all around me. I can’t say no to Big Pharma but I really just want to withdraw from the chemicals because i think they are killing me. And If I can’t I am considering suicide because I feel like nothing is working and no one has ever listened to me.

176142578,"It’s like in your case without people saying a word that correlated with your thoughts or without seeing nonverbal actions performed by people, you believed that people know your thoughts? But it’s not the way how so many people out there have ended up concluding that people know his/her thoughts. So perhaps your case is a bit different then. For example, this is how another person explained his experience.

176142632,"Certainly no way to know if it might normal, abnormal, and if the latter what it means. There just isn’t enough to go by to provide an informed response. What you described is actually a therapeutic technique introduced by the late _NAME_, called “empty chair,” where the person goes back and forth between two chairs talking to a different person, or frequently between different parts of one’s personality. Yes, it’s sort of funny when you imagine people actually doing this, but it’s a way to externalize and act out these parts so they can be understood to get a better handle on internal conflicts. If you are curious, I would Google “Gestalt therapy, empty chair technique.” You might get a better perspective about something you do which may be a way of trying to unconsciously figure out some things."

I hope your doctor increases the Clozapine and brings back Abilify to a more reasonable dose. You are doing much better already, meaning that the Clozapine works. Abilify/ Clozapine is a good combination. With my condition, which is, Schizoaffective Disorder precisely, the only FDA approved medication is Invega. It didn’t work me. In other words, like other Antipsychotics, Clozapine is used off-label for treatment. Hence, I only got a partial response on it. But, for Schizophrenia, Clozapine is the best medication. It works in upto 70 percent of the cases. Keeping Abilify with it would be a good option."

176142656,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ and welcome! I am hearing that you don’t feel ready to try medication at the moment. Do you at least have a diagnosis? With a diagnosis, you can request special accommodations at school. One of my accommodations is to have all zoom calls and lectures recorded and sent to me, so that if I don’t feel up to attending, I don’t miss important details. I also get extra time on test and quizzes, one week extensions on surprise assignments, note taking assistance, and preferential seating when classes are in person again. The only way to qualify for extra help is to have a diagnosis, and to have your doctor fill out the paperwork. Long term, medications help most people. Psychosis causes actual, physical damage to the brain. The best way to mitigate the damage is to take antipsychotics. There are also physical illnesses that can cause hallucinations. Sleep disorders, brain tumors, certain kinds of epilepsy, etc. Have you at least had a doctor rule out these causes for you? Hallucinati

I told myself to trust this dentist. In my own personal experience, if you’re on Medicaid or Medicare, I don’t get the best doctors or the best treatment, I learned this long ago but lately it’s gotten way worse. One example is that my GP was supposed to refer me to a specialist to get scans done on my kidneys. A prior scan showed something was wrong with one kidney but I needed another scan. Due to errors, laziness, maybe ignorance and just not caring instead of getting my ailing kidneys looked at in three weeks, it took the help of an advocate to get them done and it was only after 7 months. It was crazy. Due to her other err
ors, I was supposed to get 10 free visits to the physical therapist for my back but my GP didn’t fill out the proper form and I came close to missing out on free physical therapy. And I could go on… The reason I bring this up about my GP is because today the clinic is part of the same agency but it’s way across town and I told myself I would trust this dentist but my poker face failed and she saw I didn’t trust her.

But I’m usually not a big talker in groups but in certain meetings I felt comfortable enough to share when someone called on me or when I got a sponsor he told me never turn down a chance to speak. In my neck of the woods, after the speaker talks it was common for many, many meetings to use the phrase, “Does anyone have a burning desire to talk”. I don’t know if this is just a California thing but this what we say. So I heard that a lot and did what my sponsor told me and regularly got up to talk in front of 10, 20, or 25 people and shared my experience, strength and hope. This was twenty years ago but believe it or not I said way stupider things than I say here, lol. And the funny part is that my audience were ex-drunks, many who had been 
in jail or prison or homeless or ran the streets or hookers or self admitted ex-crack whores, or veterans of psyche wards, or other nefarious people who did crazy things in their addiction and ran amuck without regarding who they hurt or no respect for the law or anybody else. And this was who I told my crack stories too. Obviously, I’m not a hardcore type of person, I’ve never been to prison, I was never homeless, certainly not violent. I hobnobbed with people who had those experiences, and I did my share of crack and coke but I was kind of a straight edge user of drugs who often got asked if I was a cop by people I partied with. It actually used to bug me. But I had experiences to share in meetings, my drug stories overlapped with the guys who had been in institutions, we had some common bonds. And all these people got together in these sometimes tiny rooms of AA, CA, or NA and got along amazingly well. But these are the people I sat shoulder to shoulder with for over a thousand meetings. The basic tene
t of the AA program is “principles before personalities”. Which means at meetings leave your ego at the door. Our common purpose is to support each other and share how you got clean and what works for you to stay clean. No one wants a guru in meetings, we don’t need someone to play god, or feed their ego at the expense of everyone else. Sure there could be cliques and semi-popular people but no one was out for trouble. We all had the common purpose to get clean and stay clean and so out of the types of people I listed you would find the nicest, funniest, warmest, honestly helpful people you would ever want to meet. In their alcoholism they may have gone down to South America and hooked up with major drug dealers with guns and heroin in the forest and done god-knows what but they would greet me in meetings and leave me alone. They may have been formerly violent men or women who fought at the drop of a hat in their addiction if someone looked at them one second too long but in meetings they would stand up 
and make a whole group laugh and they were often very likable people. I’m sorry if I digressed but my point is that AA people are very tolerant. I’ll say it again, I don’t like groups but they made me feel so welcome that I actually enjoyed getting up to talk. I’m a paranoid schizophrenic but I had stuff to say that could help other people. I’ll admit, certain meetings I rarely talked in. Some groups could be dysfunctional and unhealthy for various reasons. But the solution was simple and obvious; I stopped going. I happened to live in a large city with many meetings to choose from. So I handpicked my meetings to attend and as a side note, I made some friends and in most meetings the regulars knew my face and I talked a little to some. You don’t need to embellish anything. As _AT_MENTION_ said, “The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.” I sat through some meetings and didn’t talk for a year. That was my choice and it was OK. Alcoholics and addicts are screwed up peop
le in their disease so when they get in the rooms and understand the basic principles of AA and what it’s all about they know they are lucky to be there and are grateful to be in those rooms despite their eff’_NAME_ up past. And this makes them tolerant people who are not going to judge other people. Incidentally, I was chosen to be the main speaker at a large CA group of more than a hundred people. So I got up in front of a hundred addicts and talked for 15 minutes. People came up after the meeting and told me I did a good job. ME, lol."

176142780,"When part of you knows it’s not true but you keep getting evidence that it is and you just can’t believe it you have to tell yourself over and over that it’s not true. You come on here all the time saying that it is true that people are talking about you. You have to tell yourself that you are hearing things, that it is your imagination. You have to tell yourself over and over and over. Convince yourself. I know it’s hard but that’s what you have to do. It takes will power and discipline but you can do it if you want to be free from this delusion. I believed my son was dead and I talked myself out of that one and it hardly ever comes up anymore and I believed I was dying and I talked myself out of that one and it doesn’t come up at all anymore.

174378570,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Long-term effectiveness of oral second-generation antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders: a systematic review and _NAME_-analysis of direct head-to-head comparisons. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) , Jun 2019 Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are recommended for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia. However, comparative long-term effectiveness among SGAs is unclear. Here we provide a systematic review and _NAME_-analysis of randomized trials lasting ??6 months comparing SGAs head-to-head in schizophrenia and related disorders. The primary outcome was all-cause discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included efficacy and tolerability, i.e., psychopathology, inefficacy-related and intolerability-related discontinuation, relapse, hospitalization, remission, functioning, quality of life, and adverse events. Pooled risk ratio and standardized mean differenc
e were calculated using random-effects models. Across 59 studies (N=45,787), lasting 47.4±32.1 weeks (range 24-186), no consistent superiority of any SGA emerged across efficacy and tolerability outcomes. Regarding all-cause discontinuation, clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone were significantly (p<0.05) superior to several other SGAs, while quetiapine was inferior to several other SGAs. As to psychopathology, clozapine and olanzapine were superior to several other SGAs, while quetiapine and ziprasidone were inferior to several other SGAs. Data for other efficacy outcomes were sparse. Regarding intolerability-related discontinuation, risperidone was superior and clozapine was inferior to several other SGAs. Concerning weight gain, olanzapine was worse than all other compared non-clozapine SGAs, and risperidone was significantly worse than several other SGAs. As to prolactin increase, risperidone and amisulpride were significantly worse than several other SGAs. Regarding parkinsonism, olanzapine was superio
r to risperidone, without significant differences pertaining to akathisia. Concerning sedation and somnolence, clozapine and quetiapine were significantly worse than some other SGAs. In summary, different long-term SGA efficacy and tolerability patterns emerged. The long-term risk-benefit profiles of specific SGAs need to be tailored to individual patients to optimize maintenance treatment outcomes."

Sometimes I will eat burgers and sausages, but I ensure the meat content is very high if I can. Here in the UK we also have a traffic light system on food for Calories, fat, sat fat, salt and sugar.

176142849,"If your internal monologue turns sour try to make a conscious effort at refuting it. Depression isn’t going to go away, but you can definitely tell yourself that your negative thoughts are just stupid doubts. That you’re just having a bit of a moment and that you’ll get past it. If you have depression and symptoms aren’t responding well to treatment, I’m really rooting for you, please keep trying medications. My depression was pretty severe but treatment worked and now the rest feels like my responsibility to work on. I try every day to be happy and it doesn’t take effort anymore its just become who I am. Keep trying, there is a trick to personality quirks called holding frame that pick up artists use, to reinforce their personas and I think its a great bit of psychological trickery that also works for depression. Its called “Holding frame” Don’t let your self identity conflate with these negative thoughts. You aren’t being negative, you have negative thoughts. You aren’t resp

I just feel like a shite for having put my family through those things I’m already having a day where I just feel like I’m a burden simply by being alive, and I was just about to call it a day, but now I’m not sure I can sleep even if I try. I’m so tired of feeling like I should apologise for being alive.

174378590,My parents know very little about schizophrenia and blame me for my behavior. They don’t like me. Still I am living with them.
176142880,Very well made _AT_MENTION_ !
176142881,"Sure hell yes, we are not that common, and pardon my american/danish/ english"
176142882,So peaceful right now. I love my quiet mornings. Sipping some coffee and waking up. A little pain but not too bad. I have to babysit late today but it will hopefully be quiet until then. What are you doing today?
176142883,When I was a kid I was very flexible. Now I can’t even bend to pick something off of the floor
174378589,"I have memory loss and have schizophrenia, but I also think I was droned by aliens or vril lizards at college (sometimes at least most days) and possibly cloned. That’s why I got some like AI consciousness or lizard consciousness going on and I keep going back in time after they cloned and droned me. The old me is gone I guess and I cannot go back to my childhood or remeber it or anything. I feel like 2 different people. I was an Atheist at the time in college, ended up believing in God and simulation theory, and now I’m a Christian. Because of my 2-dimensional vision and sensory issues, I think I was in hell for years because of solipsism and DP/DR. I thought stuff like mk-ultra happened to me. Maybe I was targeted by aliens or was targeted by Illuminati or something. I don’t know. My biggest dream is to go back in time before all of this and re-experience life as a new born but the aliens uploaded my consciousness to a computer and keep taking it and sending it back through time. For the lo
ngest time (seems like eternity) it feels like trillions of loops backwards in time like time is being reset in the movie “Edge of Tomorrow” theme. I have delusions too and I think I experienced real trauma but there is no evidence or proof except what my delusions and “memories” tell me. I tried getting help for the past 9 years. 2015 was my second worst psychosis and I felt like I was trapped at the mental hospital with criminals there and they were going to hurt me. That’s about it. 2016 I saw a rectangular UFO that said I helped develop or design (I have delusions I did in another life) and that it made me crazy by going inside my head and saying something like “remember what happened at college”. I don’t know if it’s aliens or not. I have delusions of aliens and time travel and simulation theory among other things. Since 2017, I started getting better. I am healing. I had severe severe dissociation that caused mental pain and agony and messed up sensory input (eyes, touch, etc.) like I 
was dead or something and was just existing as a 2-dimensional information on the edge of a black hole…"

I told my psychiatrist everything. He said thoughts I’m having are common in anxiety. I doubt that. I will see him soon. He’s a good doc, I like him. Maybe they don’t want to diagnose me yet. If I say to doc I have schizophrenia he will probably say , I dont know what he’ll say, he said I don’t have schizophrenia. I wonder do docs say that even though they think it could be schizophrenia?

174378597,I also feel this way. I dream dreams and don’t hear voices anymore. It’s wonderful to have some time when I don’t hear voices.
176142890,I kind of mess things up over the phone also. I’ll sometimes trip over my words and I’ll stutter. It doesn’t happen all the time.

I’m going to Walgreens to pull a 20 out then the bank to put it in quarters … Then put it in my jar used for laundry and hygiene stuff - I think I might also go buy groceries … Then watch a movie… I feel loopy so I’m going to take it slow… Also hoping to sell my Vizio TV and hookah …
176142894,I enjoy my ‘delusions’. I can perceive things others cannot.
176142895,"I had a cold start that way. Granted, that doesn’t mean yours is a cold. I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . Please call a pharmacy or doctor to see if it’s okay to take. If it becomes severe, can you get yourself (have someone take you) to urgent care?"
176142896,Are you 15 years old?

No one expects you to be perfect right off the bat. Remember to breath while you making the food and you’ll do great."
176142899,"Goal achieved… running for 15 minutes, and more than an hour of reading. Tonight, i’ll play piano… I really want to “translate” my thoughts for you here, because I’m thinking a lot about this. I talked to my psychiatrist/psychotherapist about this subject… Well, he doesn’t speak enough but he helped me a little. ** The following paragraphs are just thoughts experienced. They’re not necessarily fair or realistic. It’s just what I wrote tonight. So the thing is, I was implicated in my own identity of “_PERSON_”. As if I were someone who was so hateful that they wanted to end him. Someone good to throw in the trash. I was wondering at that time “why”, and maybe after that, I internalized it as something “normal”. In fact, I think I have always wondered why I was subjected to this violence. I did not understand that the adults did not see it and did not react … They were surely cowards and did not want to get involved. I could have been one of those adults now … I ca
n’t forgive them for their shitty behavior towards me ( persecutors and adults) . They made a mistake and I suffered. I blame my parents for sending me there. I did not like summer camps, even if it was I who chose this one … It was a trap, I tell myself. I am responsible for my own trap … I made a mistake because I wanted to be with people older than me. I made a mistake because I “teased” them jokingly, which triggered their wrath. So in a way in my psyche I am responsible … There was this trigger to pretend to flirt with a guy … A kind of bad joke. In the end, he was fed up … No doubt they hated my attitude with these provocative jokes … (by the way, my sexual identity is not clear.). Well, there are plenty of possible reasons for this violence, but nothing justifies it. If need be, they could have “forgotten” me a little. I wouldn’t be dead … But these were physical assaults on me. Like a symbolic murder. I also suffered violence in middle and high school but less. I was a fragil
e boy. When this other guy hit me in school, my mother was there at the exit and tried to defend me. At this moment, I felt very weak and very ashamed … These young people laughed and laughed at me … I was fragile and I still think today that I am still somehow hateful and fragile. (This also explains my behavior on this forum.). I often tell myself that someone may easily harm me, while I am rather “beefy” physically. Well, that must explain the fact that I always question myself … In short, it is especially all their behavior that must be questioned. The “especially” is inappropriate in my sentence. Their behavior is guilty. Thanks for reading me."
176142900,"_AT_MENTION_ It’s important to keep questioning AND complying, both. I talked to my new pdoc about Vraylar for the future, yesterday. I thought about _AT_MENTION_ . I think the worst inpatient pdoc once told me, that, if I work really hard, I may be able to work very part time in a place like a library one day."
176142901,Well done!! Very impressive.
176142902,"I think most schizophrenics lose functioning early on before they have a chance to succeed and achieve success. There are exceptions to the rule obviously. I think people should stop having kids and rely on the government/rich to take care of them. Perhaps, a microchip for birth control in the hip like _NAME_ (high iq person) suggested. Not sure if im a fan of mob mentality or direct ‘democracy’ aka mob rule. The best government is one that governs least. Everyone should pull their own weight and theres too many people and opinions out there that dont matter at all. The reason why society will fail (is failing) is a lack of morals and belief in God."
176142903,"Whatever _AT_MENTION_. I won’t take your attack on me seriously and ignore the creepy remark because I ain’t creepy. I wonder how your interactions go with the opposite sex, hmm?"

I am who and what I am and if people cant accept me for that I am not going to apologize for being me. If you like me cool if not then the hell with you and just walk away and leave me be but people cant apparently do that now can they people all the time are up in my face having a face off with me or mean mugging me staring too i hate it no wonder I hate most people nearly all there are but a few I like and there are but a few people I love and that’s my family and pets and that is it for good reason I stay away from other people. People need to stay out of my life and my business and get out of my face with the bs staring.

I was in the psychward in april and i have been given perphenazine 8mg (currently taking resperidone 3mg with the perphenazine) I cant seem to focus about anything, despite the fact that i watch a lot of series, i cannot explain what the series is about or how was it and compared to normal people that can have a long/short conversation i cant have one. All i reply with is Yes or No or just nod… Its like i basically forget everything within a second. Can it be linked to drugs? I have been smoking weed daily for the past ye

174378618,So my best friend I believe she is undiagnosed schizophrenic. She has delusions and I keep trying to help her with it. This man knows she is delusional and is using her delusions against her and taking advantage of her. I’m trying my hardest to help her but she believes what’s happening is real. I know how hard it is to get over a delusion because I deal with them but because I’m on medication I have a better hold over it I’m able to recognize my issues it’s just I cant get over them but I just deal with them and kind of block them out if I can. But to make things worse is seeing someone like me get tooken advantage of by a man with her delusions the world is so ?????? up this makes me so paranoid that’s why I dont trust men because there ?????? up. I want to tell her she might be schizophrenic like me and maybe she needs to get help and get on medicine but I know it will end our relationship because shes to far gone all I can do is try to help her not get tooken advantage of. This makes 
me so paranoid About men you have no ??????? idea. The world is ?????? up place.

Several _NAME_-analyses have been conducted to review the efficacy of topiramate in reducing weight, however, several issues regarding the methodology had arisen of which make the results remain ambiguous.We conducted a _NAME_-analysis of randomised controlled trials about the use of topiramate in patients with schizophrenia for weight reduction. Ten double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials and seven open-label randomised controlled trials included 905 patients.Patients treated with topiramate experienced a greater reduction in body weight and BMI. Patients in countries of the lower overweight population showed more significant BM
I reduction. Besides, studies from the Middle East and South Asia showed the greatest effect in body weight change, followed by East Asia, then Europe/America. Topiramate group was outperformed control group with significant psychopathology improvement. No difference between two groups regarding the overall side effects.Topiramate was significantly superior to control group in mitigating weight gain and psychopathology in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia. The effects of topiramate augmentation need further investigations in larger definitive studies using methodological rigor and thorough assessments."
176143006,I have ideas in my head that when I die if I went to heaven the setting would be that id be practically alone just living on a farm with animals and maybe a couple humans my closest friends and I would be able to get messed up all day. And it wouldn’t effect my mental health. But I haven’t looked forward to this neither did I think this would happen for a long time. But maybe if I died and heaven would be able to drink alcohol a lot. Pot too. I haven’t mixed the two like I used to since I was 18-20 years old I was young and I would get “twisted”. But I will never be able to drink again I dont think which is a good thing. But this morning I thought id go to heaven id be able to drink alcohol. Lol I feel like you are not a physical body like that anymore when you die even if there were an afterlife. So its just a fantasy but it sounded really sweet this morning. I remember in 2015 I drank wine all day long from afternoon to night and I said “Heaven is possible. Today was like heaven” The
n I woke up with the most brutal hangover and depression of my life ive ever had. That’s why I started naltrexone not too long after. But naltrexone is a great med for me Im thankful for it stopping me from drinking but today I fantasized about it a bit. But hey ill get through it.
176143007,Possibly a bite or cyst in my leg. It hurts walking with it. So I’m waiting. No pus comes out it excreting blood. Gah I’m sorry.

176143011,"well im just going hard at it. main thing is to lose the fat on my body so i look more muscular, Hard part i the diet. On aps, i always have hunger problem.

176143017,What I do doesn’t either. I might be just above the border where people who pay attention can tell I work out a little. I’m convinced that to look bodybuilderish you need at least one of two things 1. Top 10 out of 200 genetics 2. Steroids or other PED’s. Most people that only have the first are just going to look mainly athletic.

176143024,"Instead of wondering why we got hurt and blaming ourselves for some lack, let’s just say life isn’t always fair and certainly wasn’t fair to us."
176143025,Or do you believe you were pushed and persuaded into this illness?
176143026,well you seem like you are still stable because you speak so eloquently or I would think you are delusional…you wrote to much for me to read all of it…I used to believe I was caught in a time loop and not believing that the date of time was correct…it was hell…I hope you get better.
176143027,Did they rate yours? Mine is moderate and Drs said to not worry. Though if it becomes severe it might cause issues. Anyways I have lost 23lb and brought my cholesterol and blood pressure to very low levels.

176143039,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . It’s really hard to get the energy so I’m having 2 cups of coffee and sometimes some diet pop as well before I go to the gym to help me with energy. I really want to get to a healthy weight. I’m sick of being obese. It’s hard to look in the mirror and I don’t like having pics taken. So I’m motivated to make the changes

176143053,I don’t know if I have it worse than you but yes it is weird that I didn’t get a sz diagnosis considering that I was well out of it for many months. And continued hearing voices on meds for like two months maybe. But they say it is because I am free from voices and now on a low dose that is why… I do have trauma still from the experience though. But I hope to recover from that sufficiently at least.

Not the same ones as back then. Dont remember those ones but I know they were different than these ones. I also hope they go away. They arent fun at all. Not in the slightest. Even if they dont go away I at least hope I get better at coping with them. Right now I’m not always very good at it.

176143076,"I’ve liked Haldol for about 5 or 6 years. As you can see in the Haldol shortage and discontinuation threads, there are rumors it isn’t being manufactured in the US anymore. I liked Haldol’s high specificity to the dopamine receptors. The only second or third generation anti-psychotic I’ve found so far with high specificity to one receptor is Vraylar, which seems to have high specificity to the D3 receptors So, I’m thinking of asking a psychiatrist about going from Haldol to Vraylar. Does anyone want to share any experiences with Vraylar? Does anyone know of other second generation anti-psychotics with specificity to only one receptor? Perhaps I should try Trilafon, but I have a bad feeling it may be discontinued too."

There’s just no logic in any of this. I’m done with this topic!"
176143080,"Don’t worry about it; even the greatest person isn’t the greatest person. One thing that popped into my head is to schedule some kind of day off once or twice a week where you can just forget about responsibilities and lounge around in your pj’s all day and eat and watch TV and you don’t have to worry about anyone else. Maybe taking a deliberate, scheduled time off will give you more energy for the rest of the week. It’s probably a shitty suggestion but we all need time outs sometimes to recharge our batteries to face the world again."

174378667,"Hey guys. Lately I have come up with a technique that actually quiets my voices down a bit. I would like to share it with all of you. I was always trying to come up with a million different coping techniques for my schizophrenia. And my voices would always counter each one of them. Its like my schizophrenia was always adapting to what ever I could throw at it. It was basically an arms race. I would come up with a technique and they would counter it. Then I would have to counter that. It just went back and forth. It was madness. But after years of getting to know the voices in my head, I think I might have come up with something that is actually good lol. I wrote an article about it here: https://textuploader.com/1dx5s I wanted to tell you all about it. I know it worked wonders on me. But if it works on other people that are schizophrenic, it would be even better! I wanted to tell you guys about it was because I wanted a lot of you guys to try it out. To test it out and see if your voices can find a 
way around it. I wanted to monitor the progress of this… To see how it would do if I told other people how to do it. I am putting the method on here because I know a lot of people on here are schizophrenic like me. I know this technique I just came up with is very new. So there will probably be a lot of things wrong with it. But I really feel angry at the voices. This is like a revenge thing against the voices in my head. Sure I was able to quiet them down and that was good revenge for me. But if I tell other people about it… And they quiet their voices down too… The revenge will be more heh. Please try it out and give me feedback in the comments. Like if you have any suggestions or maybe an easier way to do it. Or even if you come up with something I can add to it."

Doc said I don’t. _PERSON_ I’m just not so sure. Maybe I’m overthinking. It’s the meds that’s got me thinking they are treating me for schizophrenia. I have very bad physical symptoms.

At first every body thought I was just reacting to the sexual abuse. That was in late 70’s I also lived in a Bible belt state and if you didn’t talk about that kind of stuff. So I didn’t get the best help I needed. So I tried for years to think it was a voice that told me it was my fault and I talked a lot to it. But everyone thought I was just talking to myself.

It can vary between believing oneself to be a particular celebrity, to thinking that TV shows and books are about you or are related to you, to simply debating with oneself about a topic one read somewhere for hours, without a practical reason. I experienced mildly similar symptomes. I speculate that the cause is that imagination of potential possibilities leaves more critical of an impression than permissible. Another speculation is that the cause is a kind of envy or desire to share on the activity that grows out of proportion. I am not sure how relevant it is. As a child after I watched superhero cartoons I often imagined and plotted my own superhero adventures, under the impression. I believe the madman delusion of TV shows , books etc. being about them, or delusion of being involved and having an impact on unrelated events, is the extension of a mechanism I tried to show with the previous example."

Since July 22nd I haven’t taken any medication but am still experiencing numbness down there. I know dopamine heavily influenced one’s sex drive, but do you know any ways to speed up the process to get my sex drive back? I’ve read that taking abilify or other dopamine agonists such as cabergoline normalized prolactin levels, but I recently got my prolactin and testosterone levels checked (13.6ng/ml and 666ng/dl respectively) and they came back normal. One possible thing that might’ve influenced my prolactin test result was taking in biotin from multivitamins, which may have caused my result to show results lower than they actually are. Other than that I think it is possible that my prolactin levels may have normalized recently and there’s a lag time before I regain my sex drive. Do you think any of these assumption

If there is something that characterises contemporary public discourse is precisely the unsubstantiated claim that the world is being run by a progressive elite imposing a draconian policy on speech. Underlying the argument is there not only a lack of awareness of unfolding social process but also a failure of imagination. The world has always been “politically correct” one way or another. Just think of how the word “homosexual” was used until very recently. Just think of what it meant to defend the freedom of slaves at a time when most shared racist beliefs encoded in everyday practices. Or to argue in public, whether seriously or as a “joke”, that god might not exist. You make the point that the modern world has "" made great strides with mental health awareness…LGBTQ issues…women’s rights…racial inequality in the workforce…etc."". Well, with every modernisation process you’re going to have winners and losers. I’d argue that among the losers you’d f

I hope you wont stay stuck in what happened though, but can look ahead at “what now?”. Can you think of things that would help you overcome this and/or find a good new therapist?"

So eating extra healthy for 8 weeks right now might be just perfect for me."

176143372,"I miss reading. I have a book that I’m about 1/3 of the way done with, but I’ve been on it for about two weeks now. And it’s fiction, which is easier to read. It makes me sad- I breezed through books before (except for _PERSON_, which was a painfully tedious!). I like guided meditation. I learned about it in a psychology class when I was about 19. At night, if I struggle to sleep because of mania, I use it to try to calm my thoughts."
176143373,"While you obey the commands, I get no such commands. Instead my voices seem to control me directly, for example they just told me “We’re now going to jump up and down and flap your arms like wings.” and that’s exactly what happened. Normally they don’t tell me though, so I assume it’s the underlying process which controls the voices that controls my body."

Now that I think about it, I don’t recall having any delusional beliefs other than believing that my intrusive thoughts speaking the truth until I was around 16, and even then, I only had brief delusional episodes until I was 18 and began living in an increasingly delusional world. It starts slowly, I guess."
176143378,"well i’ve always worked laborous jobs. so now that i’ve lost strength i have a tough job with the mentally easy jobs. like last year, i worked 6 hours on a production line and quit, i told the lady i couldn’t do it. my back and forearms were aching, and i just quit at break. then i apologized to the lady who hired me, but she said “dont worry about it, the job is not for everybody”."

176143399,"Hi, Just a thought. We cannot and should not RELATE all the positive or negative experiences WITH AMYLOBAN. We should watch what we eat, how much we sleep, any external stress factors, etc every day. There are 100s of factors that can affect the voices and anxiety. We cannot say that the affect is reducing because we had to take more amyloban. Maybe we have some unknown allergies and gut issues.

176143439,I got the crescent canna but I havent even tried it because I took really high doses of another brand while I was waiting to get it and it started to make me feel like an antipsychotic would. Which could be a good thing but I’m so sensitive to meds that I didnt really like that feeling. If your looking for a high dose cbd that’s affordable I think cresent canna is your best bet. For me low dose worked so well but the effect only lasted a few days and when I took really high doses I just didnt love the feeling. I know i brought up prism glasses so I’ll talk a little about that. I am convinced that visual processing and visual perception are responsible for our symptoms. I have been doing a lot of vision therapy lately and its helped me so much. I am getting closer to normal and when I look in the mirror my eyes look more aligned. The key to vision therapy is using disruption goggles that alter your perception. Typically you need a doctor to order these prism goggles but I found an optometric si
te that you can buy it from. Along side prism goggles you can use red and green glasses that teach you to use both eyes together. Vision is so complicated it’s not just how well you can see something.

176143450,Honestly. I couldn’t really have decent relationships with women till I got on the meds. I had so much latent paranoia and stress that it was impossible. So yes. It’s possible totally. All’s I would say is you have to practice to get better at social things so dating isn’t so bad…you learn from your mistakes if your smart enough. Big things with relationships are listening. You listen and learn about people. Remember things about them and they appreciate that. I’m not saying it’s easy to become a social animal overnite but put some steps into practice. One positive thing a day is my new mantra.

And you get a 15% discount on HPB stores so if you like to read, journal, manga, used dvds and games, etc. Our closest is _NAME_ or Rockford, so we make special day trips to either city and HPB is always our first stop. We spend like 125 bucks 5-6 times a year. Look at their website, see if one’s near you, and you could see if they’re hiring.

174378777,"I lived in a rural area with sub-par mental health services, so despite showing symptoms from an early age, they were like “yeah you seem to have difficulties adapting to norms, concentrating, and regulating your emotions, here’s an adhd diagnosis like every other maladaptive teen is gonna get.” then proceeded to give me strattera, whose only effect was permanent tardive dyskinesia and myoclonic jerks. When I moved to a normal city, I fought to get evaluated, and they quickly discovered my adhd-diagnosis was baloney, and gave me a schizophrenia diagnosis instead. I fought it for 2 seconds with the sentence “but I’m not crazy!”, but the shrink was very patient and even sent me on “psychoeducation”, which was a two week course on everything schizohrenia, to help me understand my own brain better. I have no doubt I have schizophrenia, but I am increasingly convinced I also have some sort of autism. And I am bitter it took 11 years from I showed the first symptoms, till I finally got so
me sort of diagnosis that was even halfway correct. I can’t help but wonder how much further I’d be in recovery now if I’d have gotten help at 9 or 14 instead of 21."
176143499,"I don’t think it’s inappropriate affect. When I laugh there is usually a moderately appropriate trigger, like a funny memory, but I do go on laughing for longer than what is usual for me. But sometimes I do laugh for no apparent reason, and much more if I’ve been drinking. It feels like happy laughter but I usually feel disturbed by it. Also, I seldom do it in public, I guess I feel embarrassed by it. Am I worrying too much?"
174378774,And good for you for being functional.
176143500,"Not really. Doctor once said they thought I was bpd or some crap. I down played it and got aspergers instead. I felt and was told bpd people are sort of crazy and I was never malingering or doing things for attention. Quite the opposite. I honestly tried and legitimately tried to get help. I realized there is no help. This is an evil world. I thought bpd is a woman disorder. I was eager to get diagnosed with aspergers which I may or may not have. I really don’t know what I have except a condition that causes suffering and disability equivalent to schizophrenia. In fact, some people have downplayed my illness. A lot in fact. I was interested in getting money at one time. (I get thousands of dreams and visions throughout the day). I think the doctors here are just subpar. Most are. I only met 1 doctor who heard of mk-ultra out of a dozen + or so. I’m hyper aware and vigilant of things. I pick up on conversations in the neighborhood really well and I think they’re talking about me. Same thing wi
th wifi-signal names. I’m paranoid and ocd about the wifi-names like they have meaning and are harassing me constantly. I always check them. Aspergers fits me perfectly actually. It always has. It’s just a mild case like maybe just alelles or genetic expression. I wouldn’t qualify for anything and I probably wouldn’t get diagnosed if re-tested. It was a once in a lifetime sort of thing. No extra money. Maybe I sound desperate or a beggar because I live off of 60 bucks a week approx. It ain’t no life. I wanted more for myself. I get dreams of other lives like tapping into the parallel universe/multiverse thing and actually was there at those places just like now. I actually lived those lives. I had one crappy therapist said I sounded or was munchaussen by proxy. What a jerk and should have lost his license. I don’t know why. I thought weird things back then like I could sue people or people owed me money, I guess. I was out of control with my paranoia and delusions thinking I was a time traveler an
d wanted a yellow phone book lol. Part of me wants to figure out or find my original life’s wife according to my time travel delusion, which doesn’t matter anymore. Maybe it was _NAME_ lol. Like I said, a past life a million lifetimes ago in another dimension isn’t relevant or cool anymore. People are different in this new reality and I have moved on. I was just curious. (I saw time traveler’s wife book in the hospital and someone threw it away) (I feel like I have above average recall of life events). All my delusions are somewhat legit. I try to make sense of my crappy life. I guess I post here instead of trying to make money off my suffering and I’m too scared and nervous to write books or do interviews – I have paranoia and low-self esteem. I’m too self-critical. I also deleted all my stuff. I just want to move forward with my life like Ground _PERSON_ Day, I guess."

174378788,"I have not smoked weed in about 4 months. I understand the craving. My advice is don’t give it much thought. If you do decide to smoke, do it in an environment where you feel safe. Don’t drive while stoned and keep in mind many people with schizophrenia react badly to mind altering substances. I’m not necessarily encouraging the use. Only suggesting if you do decide to try to take precautions so that you’ll be okay just in case your mind plays tricks on you. I can smoke small amounts and be fine though if I smoke like I used to, it starts really dumbing me down and I overthink things. For the record my first psychiatrist gave me a prescription for it before it was legal recreationally here. It helped with a few side effects of the antipsychotic he also put me on. Oh and one more thing, some antipsychotics have different reactions to cannabis. Some might lessen their effectiveness causing you to feel symptoms you normally would experience if not for medication. One last thing, remember you c
an only get so high. You can smoke more to maintain the high but sometimes you don’t need much to feel okay. Matter of fact, usually you don’t need any at all to feel okay. It does help with depression among other things. Don’t make that an excuse to smoke unless the depression is real."

Also, the noticeable change within my daily routine of just going for a walk is now a little tricky due to harassment by what appears to be Snapchat using trying to trigger or spy on you.

(thanks if you are serious lol) i mean i do like the lake part at the front…that looks quite good doesnt it. and the colours but i have room for improvement with painting…and drawing… sometimes like you say, i look at a painting i did and i am impressed. like details that i have managed to make look good without realising until the very end,cos u go into a bit of a trance when u are just observing the photo and then painting…sometimes. thanks for the encouragement"

176143620,"I used to feel sorry for myself a lot. I think I did it in part because I felt like there was no one else to do it. Like I deserved someone to recognize and empathize with my pain. Problem is that it can be self-defeating, not empowering. You can drown in self-pity."
176143621,"My neighbors an outgoing, social dude. I on the other hand, am not. It’s fine but I get irritated because just his attitude is constantly sending out the message that he’s king or something here and it would be ridiculous that anybody would stand up to him or challenge his authority. I went along with the program for awhile until it hit me that regardless of strong his personality is, that he is not always right and that I know more what’s better for me than him. But in our little world, he basically took over the back area with the carport. It just irks me. And to me, (I can’t prove it though) he even wants to run the insides of my apartment. It is so clear to me often that he is trying to control or have power over me in my apartment but when everything is calm I just sit in my house and overlook it. That’s my biggest gripe, I understand people want a little power and control even if it’s on this little scale at our building. But I figured out maybe 6 or 7 months ago that they don’t 
want me to have any power and they get pretty mean about it."

I got diagnosed two years ago and I had some reasonable doubts about that so called depression. Then over the past year it’s been gradually getting worse. A year ago I would have said I’m not depressed, now I’m suicidal so probably now I definitely am depressed lol"

Actually the side effects of these supplements is very insignificant when compare with the medications and other foods we take daily but OCD mind simply amplifying the insignificant risk or doubt into a very serious matter."
174378810,"Ok, thanks. _PERSON_, I tried abilify even twice… My pdoc really wanted that it works, but no, I went too anxious and restless. I have stil 7,5 mgs of Zyprexa, ya know. Its a good dose still I think… But tonight, its hard. Hope it will go away too…"

Men make great friends, for beers and laughs, as long as they are willing to stay at a decent distance. Any closer than what I’m comfortable with and I too run away in one way or another. Tango dancing is my exposure therapy. Do you have this with all guys? How are you with new people when there is no dating?"
176143632,If I’m honest the voice thing perplexes me . I’ve had quite a few times when I’ve been asked to repeat things or people have misheard what I’ve said . Were they all hard of hearing? Was I talking too softly ? Perhaps my diction is bad ?
176143633,Can you share how’s it help? What symptom did you suffer and how it’s helped when your on 20mg?
174378818,"Like it or not, there is only proof of correlation that people with sz tend to use cannabis. That is not the same as proof of causation. The article is propaganda where they jumped to the conclusion that “cannabis can raise the risk of schizophrenia”. when the actual study they used has no mention of schizophrenia at all. So bootlick all you like, any reasoned man can see the evidence with their own eyes."
176143634,I bite my fingers and tear them off until they bleed. And I have no choice but to do it because I don’t have any outlet.

However, I was diagnosed with bipolar for a long time before it was changed to sz. It’s my day off today and all I’ve done is shower, wash my hair and put makeup on. I’m going to go out and see some friends later though. Generally I do bog all when I’m not working and find it really hard to stay on top of housework and life admin."

176143641,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ for understanding
176143642,I suffer from OCD intrusive thoughts and also depression I believe. When I am better and healed I will deliver a speech of what I went though hopefully I will inspire and help other people.
176143643,No not really. Just some tiredness from the meds but that has gone away as I have gotten used to them

How I realized I needed meds: my first case manager called my facility to get the exact meds and doses so I can take them right, I made it a goal to take them as prescribed, then wax and waned getting off them because I kept convincing myself i didn’t need them, didn’t like the side effects. Got the injection I’ve been on for a half a year, and a couple times I told the nurse right before she stuck me, I didn’t want it (good thing she is persistent), and now I pretty much gave in to psychiatry and I’m honest, people are more willing to help.

176143665,Last time I had to drink a gallon of that stuff. This time the medicine came in a little 6 oz. bottle that they had me mix with water to make a 16 oz. solution. It was pretty strong but they gave me a tip and said to get a lemon slice and keep dipping it in sugar and then drink the solution. They were right: I used the lemon after each sip and it totally killed the taste of the solution. I drank it right down.

176143674,"The first time around I was pretty delusional and thought my family was out to get me because they got me baker acted 3 times. I was a complete mess. The medication they put me on made me very sedated, I was sleeping 16 - 17 hours a day, and gained 30lbs. I was very down about my life and didn’t know how I would return back to being normal. The psychiatrist I started seeing eventually closed down his practice to teach and by that time I started to feel better and thought I didn’t need the medications anymore so I got a job as a cashier and quit the medications cold turkey. I was walking a lot on my job which helped me to lose weight but I eventually returned back to normal and was stable for almost 10 months until I left my job. Eventually the psychosis returned and I relapsed. Fast forward I eventually stabilized on the new medication but it took almost a year for me to return to normal. I’m not delusional, firmly grounded in reality, have insight into my illness, don’t hallucinate, voices 
are virtually non existent, don’t talk to myself, work as a cashier, maintain my hygiene, dress nice and smell good, listen and read books, podcasts, talk to friends and socialize when I can. It took time but no one would ever suspect that I have such a severe mental illness. I still have sleep problems, sexual dysfunction, memory issues, high prolactin levels and severe constipation which are a side effect of the medications. The others I’m fine with but the constipation I’m desperately trying to resolve. I’ve recovered a lot and have come a long way. I still live with my parents but help them out financially by giving them $500 a month. I try to maintain my independence and try to remain hopeful that things will continue to get better."

176143678,Thanks! Im glad im not alone in this! Howd did u decide the health befits were better than the side effects?
176143679,I am not denying this feeling. What I take issue with is hypothesizing a feeling that it supposedly replaces and on the basis of which we supposedly build our confidence in the reality of others.

176143735,"I’ve been having a negative opinion of myself for a while lately, which can cause me to feel particularly down on myself like I’m looking up from a well with no perceived way out. It, however, does not make me in a state of acrimony, which is good. So while I may be joking a lot more now, I’m not joyous. The only time I am in a state of pure happiness is when I’m doing religious things, but I obviously can’t do that all the time. I think this all stems from my addiction, mental illness, and low self-confidence that I’ve always had. Luckily I am improving on those things with a therapist and other ways. I feel like a complete and utter failure in everything I do. I’m not good at anything, even though I firmly believe that each man and woman have at least one talent or gift. I guess I just haven’t found it yet. All I can admit is my weaknesses, not any strengths I may have. Sometimes I ponder with such superstition that I firmly think that I was born just to show people how not to be. 
And unbeknownst to me for a while, I also think that I have nothing to go for. I’m not competitive like I once was, and I’m not as aspired to go forward. And I think that its basically impossible for me to date anyone, much less get married; I’m just not desirable in any way and am pretty uninteresting."

176143741,"You’re not understanding the issue. I’m not judging, just pointing that out. Gene-environment interactions are effects that are not caused by genes, but also not caused by the environment. They are interaction effects, dependent upon both, such as when a gene causes one effect in one environment and another effect in a different environment. Most heritability estimates are not very good at accounting for gene-environment interactions. Studies that have tried to account for this show significant interaction effects in the development of sz. This does not mean that the heritability coefficients are wrong. It does not mean the environment is as important as genetics in the populations studied. It means that when we examine it closer, the effects of the genes are very dependent on the environment and vice versa. The most important study I’m thinking about is one where they examined children with a high genetic sz risk that were adopted and children with a low genetic sz risk that were adopted. In 
home environments that were associated with a low risk of developing sz, both groups showed low rates of developing sz. In home environments with a high risk for sz, both group showed higher rates of developing sz, but the high-genetic risk group stood out with a much higher risk than the low-genetic risk group. That’s a gene-environment interaction."

176143761,_AT_MENTION_ Things for me didn’t actually change much till I moved here in September 2017. All that happened as a result of the abusive and rude behaviour from mental health services at my last place was I stopped asking for help and support and didn’t challenge anything. I then became a more acceptable patient in their eyes. My stock reply when asked how I was was ‘So so’ or ‘Not too bad’ I didn’t go into details.

I never really did this, tried to but felt guilty and me not being on my phone ever led to me being really good at my job, and my boss knew it too. Its not like theyll fire you on the spot, if they tell you not to, and your caught doing it, probably just going to get a slap on the wrist. _USER_ID_: also everyone is on their phone at work so i wouldnt worry about it.

174378856,"Okay. Personal Story That Might Be Useful To Anyone Having Trust Issues. Let Me Start With Being Diagnosed. My Mom Told Me Of A Story Of Someone In My Family Being Diagnosed With Schizophrenia & I Was Clueless. Never Really Thought Much About It On My Own, (Because It Didn’t Make Any Sense). But!, It Was Embedded Into My Psyche. Many Years Later I Was Diagnosed Myself. After My Mom Got Me Included Into The System, I Began To Go To The Clinic I Still Am Going To Now. It’s Been Some Years, And Some Battles, Some Trust Issues, Some Strange Universe, Some Study, Some Loss, And Some Gain. First, To My First Therapist, Then To My Doctor, Then To Another Doctor, Then To Some Group Therapy, And All Of Thus In A Continued Cycle. All The Way To My Second Therapist. My First Therapist Recommended My First Medications, To My Doctor, Which Was Zyprexa. I Remember Sitting In The Living Room With The Box Of Med’s, And Reading The Side Effects, And The Whole Thing Made Me Nervous. And So, Over Some Time (Aft
er Concerns To My Doctor), I Was Prescribed Invega. My First Therapist Showed Me The First Schizophrenic Forum I Decided To Be Apart Of. It Ended Pretty Terrible After Some Odd Time, (On The Forum), And My First Therapist Disappeared. I Ended Up Not Taking My Med’s And I Had No Therapist To Talk Too, Nor Did I Trust The System In Any Way. In Which I Ended Up Getting Injections From A Nurse That Worked Inside The Clinic. It Was A Horrendous Experience And That Pathe Ended Up, To Many Trials And Errors, Into Many Dead Ends. After A Letter To The President At That Time, My Next Visit With The Doctor Was Where She Asked If I Wanted Pills Or Injections. I Said, ‘Pills’. Then I Ended Up With A New Therapist. My Mom Had Passed Away, (She Got Me Into The System), A Few Years Later, My Dad Passed Away, My Family Disappeared Completely, And I Ended Up Deeper Into The System. Now On The Subject Of Trust, I Realized That The System Isn’t Perfect, But!, It’s Trying. And If We Listen, Speak, Compromise, And Find 
The Spark Of Trust, In Ourselves, And Each Other. There Will Always Be A Way. For A Hopeful, Promising, Well Intended Future. For Our Mind, Body, And Spirits. (And Whether Or Not You Are Spiritual, The Word ‘Spirit’, Is Up To You). If You Don’t Agree With Something, Bow Your Head In Defeat Gracefully. It May Affect Your Ego, But!, What Is It You Are Actually Losing?. Ask Logical Questions, Consider Your Options, Speak Honestly, From Your Heart, And Listen Intuitively. The System Is Trying. In Which, I Can’t Express That Enough. Because In The End, It Will All Work Out. With A Little Bit, Of Commonsense, Intuition, Peaceful Instincts And Hope, Love, And Peace. Because…, As _PERSON_’s Wife Said, ‘If You Try The Best You Can, The Best You Can Is Good Enough’. If You Have Any Questions Feel Free To Ask!.

176143808,"I heard internal voices say about a half a year ago, before i went ortomolecular. I actually think olanzapine makes me hear internal voices. Because I can’t remember hearing them before they put me on medication. Internal voices are maybe hard to distinguish from thoughts, but for example there was this voice/thought in my head that would trouble me for the smallest things. For example if I got on a bus the voice would contemplate if I should say goodbye to the busdriver and how to do it when I got off for the whole ride, or if I left home I was worried about how and when to greet my neighbours. Just silly stuff all the time. I think the herbs and vitamins are helping me counter that aspect of olanzapine. Because I seldom hear the voices now.

I get unwanted thoughts every day but usually it’s me calling to mind the thoughts that _PERSON_ had inserted in the near past. But they don’t stick all day. Eg. _PERSON_ puts thought in my head to kill dog. It’s definitely not mine and causes irritation and distress. Then it passes and later I remember the thought in passing but it’s me recalling _PERSON_. I know exactly when it’s placed in my head and when it’s my recalling the placed thought.

Neuroleptic drugs are generally prescribed for psychiatric disorders, as well as for some gastrointestinal and neurological disorders.

There has been interest in the efficacy and mechanism of non-pharmacological interventions to alleviate these symptoms. The present study aimed to examine the remediation effect of working memory (WM) training in patients with schizophrenia with prominent negative symptoms. Methods: Thirty-one schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms were recruited and assigned to either a WM training group or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group. The WM training group underwent 20 sessions of training using the dual n-back task over one month. A functio
nal neuroimaging paradigm of the Affective Incentive Delay (AID) task was administered before and after the training intervention to evaluate the remediation effect of the intervention. Results: Our results showed that the WM training group demonstrated significant improvement in the WM training task and inattention symptoms. Compared with the TAU group, increased brain activations were observed at the right insula and the right frontal sub-gyral after WM training in the training group. Conclusions: These findings support the efficacy of WM training in ameliorating hedonic dysfunction in schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms."

But just consider your actions carefully and don’t jump into disposing your meds just because someone makes a good argument that sounds good at the time. Be smart about this, make your decisions wisely and carefully. Going off of meds can be a huge life-changing decision. Make an informed decision using knowledge and evidence from other people and yourself."

174378878,"Yeah anyone can have tics. Like most psychological/neurological disorders, a diagnosis only occurs when the symptoms are interfering with your ability to live your life. I firmly believe that most of these things are a spectrum. Everyone has autistic traits, everyone has schizophrenic traits, everyone has OCD and depression and anxiety traits. It just depends on how much those traits impact your functioning."

174378885,"Well it may well be that TCM doesn’t deal with Schizophrenia at all, just tries to optimise the health of the body in order to give the mind a chance to heal. Note I say mind as, as far as I know, TCM never recognised the brain as significant in the past. On the other hand, it never recognised muscles either, but in the past century massage therapies based on TCM have incorporated the structures of muscles into their theory, so modern TCM may attempt to deal with the brain now. Western medicine splits the treatment into mind (psychology) and brain (psychiatry) and sometimes more recently body (nutrition) though the latter is still thought of as somewhat alternative. The theories of TCM and Western medicine for the body and cause of sickness are wildly divergent at a foundational level, though there are quite a lot of attempts to integrate them at a more superficial level. Whether this is useful of not depends on your point of view."

176143932,I guess I haven’t really told too many people. But the ones I’ve told seem to take it in stride and go right on with the conversation. Then if I’m acting weird they ask me if I’ve taken my medicine. Which is sort of funny because usually I would have forgotten to take it that day and it shows. The real weird reactions are from medical professionals. They always treat me with kid’s gloves when they find out my diagnosis. And sometimes I feel my physical complaints aren’t taken as seriously because I’m mentally ill.
176143933,I was only canned on one job which was my last job where I worked for a subsidiary of Hallmark printing custom greeting and business cards.

176143944,"Ok bear with me on this one it’s kind of long… For me everything revolved around fear. In some cases it was fear that some people knew I was mentally ill and thought I was a freak, in other instances it was that I just alienated people because of how weird I am, and other times it was that there might be people out to get me. All of this situations were in my head, and I had to reason with myself that even if they weren’t and it was all real, so what? I mean if there were people out to get me for some unknown reason I don’t want to live my life as a chicken so that solved that problem, and if there were people who knew I was mentally ill, instead of letting it get me down, I can use it to motivate myself to get better and overcome it/deal with it instead of letting it hurt me, and as far as being just kind of weird, well, the world to me is pretty generally boring anyways so if people are closed minded towards people who are different or eccentric they aren’t the type of people I want to 
know anyways. I guess the point is that you can take things causing you anxiety and flip them upside down and use it to motivate you to change or live with less fear."

Further, it is not known whether recessively inherited risk mutations can be identified through homozygosity by descent (HBD) mapping.We studied self-reported and DNA-based estimates of inbreeding among Egyptian patients with SZ (n?=?421, DSM IV criteria) and adult controls without psychosis (n?=?301), who were evaluated using semi-structured diagnostic interview schedules and genotyped using the Illumina Infinium PsychArray. Following qual
ity control checks, coefficients of inbreeding (F) and regions of homozygosity (_USER_ID_) were estimated using PLINK software for HBD analysis. Exome sequencing was conducted in selected cases.Inbreeding was associated with schizophrenia based on self-reported consanguinity (?2?=?4.506, 1 df, p?=?0.034) and DNA-based estimates for inbreeding (F); the latter with a significant F?×?age interaction (??=?32.34, p?=?0.0047). The association was most notable among patients older than age 40 years. Eleven _USER_ID_ were over-represented in cases on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 11, and 14; all but one region is novel for schizophrenia risk. Exome sequencing identified six recessively-acting genes in _USER_ID_ with loss-of-function variants; one of which causes primary hereditary microcephaly.We propose consanguinity as an age-dependent risk factor for SZ in Egypt. HBD mapping is feasible for SZ in adequately powered samples."

174378901,"So, after 2 years of waiting, my pdoc finally agreed to switch me to a different antipsychotic. I’m switching from invega sustenna to zyprexa. I’ve been on 75 mgs of the invega sustenna depot for the past two years, but while invega gave around 16 side effects, zyprexa gives me about 3 or 4. I can hardly wait for the anhedonia to go away, among others. Seeing as I will have so few side effects, is there a higher chance that zyprexa will not work as an antipsychotic for me, meaning, that I will be treatment resistant to it?

176144001,"Back in 1992, I was working as an RN in a hospital on a telemetry unit and in an ICU. I became depressed and suicidal and was hospitalized so, I lost my job. This counted as points against my license. Then in 1993, I was working as an RN in a nursing home as a charge nurse on the night shift when I forgot some of my psychotropic meds at home. I diverted some patient psych meds for my own use and made the mistake of telling another nurse on duty about it. Well, that nurse told the director of nursing and she informed the state board and that was the permanent end of my license. I could never get my license reinstated after that for many years except on a probationary basis. And it’s impossible to get hired under that condition. Only very recently (in the last year) has it been possible for me to take a nurse refresher course at a local hospital and fully reinstate my license. But, I am 60 years old now and close to retirement age. My last pdoc told me that my illness, sza, can’t handle the stres

174378915,"Hi. Firstly, an admission of defeat: as you might have expected, I haven’t found yet the answers to the ‘big questions’. But I have, however, been working during this fortnight on a possible alternative diagnosis. This is very much a work in progress, in no way written in stone, which I shall be discussing next Friday with my nurse and hopefully with my psychiatrist at some point in the near future. I would greatly appreciate any input or (respectful) criticism you may have. Proposed Alternative Diagnosis: Depersonalisation/Derealisation Disorder and Existential OCD (with poor insight). A few points: I’m not “in denial” of my SZ diagnosis. I freely admit to having mental health problems (including an OCD diagnosis and frequent bouts of depression), but I happen to disagree with how doctors have framed my symptoms as being indicative of a psychotic disorder. This might surprise you, but I’m not even biased against the idea of suffering from SZ. When I first received the diagnosis I act
ually felt relieved. Here was something that could provide me with an alibi for my oddities and shortcomings as a human being. Indeed, many of the creative types I socialise with, extremely tolerant of neurodiversity as they are, tend to view SZ as the embodiment of a very particular, even poetic, vital stance. But soon I developed some serious objections to this diagnosis, some of a more general and theoretical nature (antipsychiatric arguments which are not relevant here), and others more focused on the particulars of my case. Some of you might feel tempted to dismiss my case as typical of a SZ sufferer in denial. To those going down that road I’ll just say, fine, I don’t deny my symptoms or personal distress, but please consider which mental illness best fits those symptoms. I’d argue that my obsessive questioning and constant search for reassurance, the quality and intensity of my obsessions, my morbid preoccupation with radical doubt rather than with fixed beliefs (as it is the case with real delus
ions), my psychological solipsism (extremely typical in DP/DR sufferers as you’ll see below), and my general pattern of behaviour are better explained with my proposed diagnosis. Why so many polls, or the insistence in trying to convince others without being convinced myself? Admittedly, some of my obsessions have been coloured with religious, even bizarre elements, which may have given them a delusion-like feel, but this overly dramatic presentation is easily explained away when you consider my past as a hardened (but benign) internet troll. Some particularly shrewd critic might object that while my (extremely few) ‘positive symptoms’ are amenable to an alternative explanation, my negative symptoms are not. Well, even granting I’m not currently depressed, or taking Aps, my two main ‘negative symptoms’, apathy and avolition, can be explained by looking at how I acquired some of my personality traits. My severe OCD made me very adverse since very young to all kind of stressors. Over the years, I’
ve found that this diligence has paid off in the form of decreased anxiety, but at the price of social withdrawal, and lately, a loss of ambition. This coupled with the ‘psychological’ effects of my separation from my wife, my poor work ethic, and the fact that I’ve achieved already some of my early goals, explains my terminal ‘loafer attitude’. In addition, my solipsism and derealisation have taken a lot of the glamour out of the shared world; it just doesn’t feel real enough for me to bother with. Now the _USER_ID_ gritty. DP/DR. Never mind the video. The comments’ thread is littered with testimonials showing the prevalence of psychological solipsism and the style of radical questioning seen in my posts. I’d like also to point out that the “self-disturbance” model of SZ can, arguably, provide an equally authoritative account of psychological solipsism in DP/DR. An example: “My existential thought was: What if everything is fragment of my imagination”. Existential OCD. Psychology Toda
y What If Nothing Is Real?: Experiencing Existential OCD Part 1: The experience of worrying that the world around you does not exist.

I feel like there’s something so wrong with me. I want to be better but it’s never enough. I just don’t know how to feel secure and worth something.

176144053,"It could mean that your meds aren’t working or it could mean that you have a severe underlying personality disorder, or it could mean both. Mental illness often strips away impulse control allowing what was hidden deep in a person to come to the service where it is highly visible. It’s not that SZ makes people violent so much as it removes the necessary self-control from the limited number of people who tended towards violence before they developed this illness. It something you’ll need to talk to doctors and therapists about. I personally become suicidal without my Wellbutrin. I have no urges to hurt others, even when floridly ill and in the grip of my positive symptoms."

176144066,"Its not so bad. For me i tend to have quite a dark humour about my diagnosis - yes we suffer. But we have ideas that pop into our heads that “normies” would not even think about.

174378937,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The association between gestational diabetes mellitus, antipsychotics and severe mental illness in pregnancy: A multicentre study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology , May 29 2019 There have been conflicting findings for severe mental illnesses and the risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Outside of pregnancy, both severe mental illnesses and specific antipsychotic medications have been associated with an elevated risk for metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus.This study examined the risk of developing GDM in relation to mental disorder, psychotropic treatment and comorbid risk factors.A retrospective study of 539 pregnant women with mental disorders was carried out. Measures included GDM diagnosis, mental health diagnosis, psychotropic medication, body mass index, age, smoking, alcohol and illicit substance use.This study found that women with psychotic disorders had a signifi
cantly elevated risk for GDM (20.9%) compared with women with non-psychotic severe mental illnesses during pregnancy (P = 0.023), and nearly threefold the expected population rate (8.3%). Furthermore, women using specific antipsychotic agents - risperidone (P = 0.016), clozapine (P < 0.001) and higher-dose quetiapine (P = 0.029) - also had a higher risk of developing GDM. After adjusting for maternal age and body mass index, women taking these specific agents continued to have a fourfold risk of having GDM compared with women not taking these agents. Smoking, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use were not associated with elevated GDM rate in women with mental disorders.These findings support the need for early screening and closer surveillance of metabolic risk in pregnancy for women with psychotic disorders and those taking specific atypical antipsychotic agents."

176144078,I agree with everyone. You did the right thing!
176144079,I don’t want to rain on your parade but the title of this thread is misleading if you are still on meds. Peoples ideas of what constitutes a full recovery vary dramatically. Congrats on the job though and congrats on feeling better.

174378949,"Olanzapine has been a miracle drug for me for about the last almost 22 years for me. So glad I’ve never been on clozapine, you have to get blood work done once a week for quite a while and then once every 2 weeks for a while after that and when it finally settles in your system it’s once a month.

174378953,"Sad but true. When it comes to comparing illnesses and severity, you’re right some people function better than others. Early in my disease I was told I was high functioning because I could catch a bus. I didn’t know that was considered high functioning, I took buses a lot and just took it for granted. Anyways, in my life I found that my level of functioning fluctuates over time. When I first got ill I suffered and went through hell yada, yada, yada. I slowly became stable only to relapse after several years. Anyways, you can catch my story somewhere one of these days. You have a chance you may get better. I’m sorry you’re suicidal at this point, but in the future you may get better. But recovery ain’t going to come knocking at your door, usually you have to go after it. It takes action. Even if it’s going outside for an hour or two each week. Anyways, I could go on a long spiel about taking small steps but I’ll save it for another day.

176144167,"I always get the feeling that I’m being followed _AT_MENTION_. But its not so much being followed, but more so just being watched. I believe, the ‘following’ aspect arises when you do erratic and weird behaviour which in turn may cause some individuals to ‘taunt’ you. This may lead to them following you etc and this may be where it stems from. It’s hard to get rid of and I struggle with it on a daily basis. Its gonna be really hard for us with this new age of technology, its gonna seem that people are ‘following’ your social media accounts. (This is is just bizarre to compare and talk about). IMO.

I’ve been browsing wikipedia on quantum mechanics and trying to find little hidden treasures. Other interpretations of QM besides MWT that explains shcrodingers cat and how after he dies, instead of _PERSON_’s argument which is probably wrong in my and others opinion, the time symmetry is off and I go backwards in time to restart my life. Similar to a causal loop instead of a time loop but it begins semi-randomly (I call it AI or God) but no later than 2010/2011-2013. Then it gets complicated with philosophical zombies and ????. I’m sort of thinking it’s exactly like EA Games ‘Sims’ unfortunately where they can see you in the room through the walls and ???? using a computer and get inside yo
ur head. It’s a lot like Westworld too. Haven’t totally figured it all out but probably won’t. I’m scared half the day. I’m just searching for clues and answers. I think I know my stuff. I think aliens ?????? with me hardcore and stuff because I cannot go back in time or least I don’t remember or they abducted me as a kid but then where was I? Did time and life exist? Are there multiple clones or dopplegangers of me existing? I think the aliens trapped us in this ???????? sim that is supposed to study, trap, and dumb us down in terms of physics.

He went through a surgery and has lived a few years without problems. Now he’s starting chemo again though… No one in the family is dealing healthily except my uncle. Some pity him, some throw it under the rug. Nobody’s told him he has cancer. He’s in trade school now and he has made friends. He’s quite handsome though he has a white rash on his face. It seems it’s possible his best days are behind him. He might never finish college. How can I help him as a member of the family?"

174378958,"I have undiagnosed ocd (obsessions, mainly). Im not sure how haldol influences it. I feel antipsychotica in general worsened it. I hated haldol at first, because it indeed made me depressed. And sleepy. But when i went to a lower daily dose and for the rest just prn, i liked it better. For prn: it is quick, but only works if you are aware in time that meds are needed. This is sometimes a little scary, in the past i have crashed and lost insight and became afraid of meds before i could take it. Only if that isnt an issue for you, i would recommend prn use. For daily use i prefer very low dose haldol over newer meds. E.g. abilify didnt work and made me restless, zyprexa had all the bad issues of haldol for me PLUS all sorts of other side effects. Haldol is quite “clear” in that it just knocks me out right away and i know what to expect."

I lost the 30 pounds I gained by intermittent fasting. I highly recommend it. It’s easy and it changed my life. Eat fewer meals, stop snacking, but eat until you are full. The longer time between meals, the more you’re body is burning fat instead of producing insulin. Eat = insulin, Fast = fat burning mode (ketosis). It’s the simple way our bodies work. So, you can use it to your full advantage. Many people do, and it works 100% of the time. No diets, no tricks, no counting calories. Just skip breakfast and snacks.

174378969,"I do not believe that I have delusions. I have something which looks like ideas of reference. I take meds like olanzapine and sulpiride but phenomena which may be considered delusions are still present. Psychotropic drugs appear to have no effect on them at all. I think that I have not schizophrenia, I had only sporadical and very short hallucinations or hallucinoids. Despite it I function low, for example due to OCD (especially associated with the risk of infection and, more generally, serious pain). I would say that I experienced supernatural things which were classified as symptoms of mental illness (schizophrenia-type disorder). I suppose that if I would hear voices I would think that they are from unclean spirits, are sort of devilish influence. But it is not my problem. I have something which might be considered delusions of messengership and grandiosity. I might suppose that I am the apostle send to the mankind by one and only God to convert all people to true path and change the world drama
tically, but in good way (for example by elliminating poverty and sexual impurity). I suppose that my numerous coincidences are signs from supernatural powers (evil or good, maybe some are from good forces and some from evil ones)."

176144207,"I like how you said they’re trained to be the sane ones. I literally think that’s what psychiatry does. They access individuals and pretty much “throw” them into “sanity”.

I’m having fun by watching movies but I don’t see my friends for a month (just relatives). Why I don’t see my friends? Because I feel ashamed for not studying or having a job. I don’t want to study or work on a job that I don’t like. I know I’ll give up soon if I take something I don’t like. It’s not that I don’t want to help people, it’s just that I can’t work with a thing that I don’t feel good.

176144260,You ever thought about just general nursing? Being a patient of the health system will give you a leg up and you can see how it all goes without committing to something specialized. Psych nursing is stressful. I have a close friend who had to leave it and it wasn’t pleasant. You can always specialize later.
176144261,For me it always has been. It’s simple math: going once a month to the clinic and getting one shot vs. having to remember to take two pills with a liquid every night at the same time. I get the shot and forget about medication for a month. And getting a shot saves a trip to the pharmacy for refills.

I’ve been dealing with anxiety, a depressed feeling mood, and trouble concentrating at times. I thought it was just stress at first. Then I started getting audible hallucinations before falling asleep. This new symptom is what’s really concerning me. I’m almost 40 years old and never had any mental health issues before. It doesn’t run in my family either. Could this be the start of Schizophrenia? I’m going to have to get some professional help from someone soon."

176144288,"hey _AT_MENTION_ I think about my health a lot. I’m in my mid 40’s and have suffered from a lot of injuries and chronic pain. Old age does not sound good to me as I’ve already suffered so much pain & debilitation. But I want to be in the best health I can for as long as I can. So I do a lot of research about age appropriate diet and lifestyle. The results are in, I should exercise often with high intensity interval training and I should eat only 15% protein and the rest high quality (read lentils) carbs. It’s pretty hard to follow that advice but I’m trying. I’m on lurasidone & my dr. warned this leads to diabetes & obesity, I’ve had my latest blood test to monitor what’s going on. Currently avoiding seeing my dr to discuss the results as I hate having dr’s preach to me from their high horse about how I should not take medication or drink alcohol 'cos it’s bad for my metabolism. As an older friend once told me, it’s a BIG responsibility to have a body."
176144289,"I think it’s possible to get healed, but it’s difficult. I find it’s hard to make good choices for myself in daily life and I think it is because of the drugs. It messes with the brain. They call it medication, but it’s just downer drugs(most ap’s anyways) that we take in careful moderation. I feel like a involuntary junkie and I wonder if it is right from the system to use ap’s as a first line defence against mental illness. It might have been the right move to put me on them initially, but there was absolutely no effort ftom the system to contemplate the possibility of me to function without them. I have never been appointed a therapist. I applied for sessions with a psychologist once but was denied. It’s just like “take these drugs and that’s all we can do for you”. I do what I can though, but I know my brain doesen’t function like it’s supposed to anymore. It’s like some psychological barriers have been removed and it’s making my life difficult to manage. Things that 
were simple before have become hard work. I’m not quitting though. I try to be physical active, keep myself busy, supplement, work when I am able…still hoping for a happy ending."

174378986,"Hi, I’m new here and I came here for help on this very topic. Just delete this if it doesn’t belong here. Do people that don’t have Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective also get negative symptoms from antipsychotics? My diagnosis is bipolar 1. Yes I have had a more severe spell of psychosis from a drug interaction back in 2008 but since then I would classify it as “abnormal thought content” my psychiatrist calls it delusions of reference, paranoid/persecutory delusions, delusions of grandeur, thought insertion, thought withdrawal, derailed speech, in combination with other thought issues (I think ADHD) and poor nonverbal communication that comes and goes (looks like intermittent autism). Long story short I am on lithium and lamictal and I hate antipsychotics. Just like most of you here if I don’t need to be on one I’d rather not be. My psychiatrist and I have this argument going on, he is trying to change my dx to Schizoaffective. I think it is because he is dying to get me on Rexulti and is 
in bed with _PERSON_. He claims I was in the beginning stages of psychosis at a session last November, asked me if I was high on meth (I wasn’t) and put me on Abilify for 10 weeks. It was 10mg then I complained and down to 5mg and I still suffered from Anhedonia and other negs (I still showered, etc but took short cuts). He claims that this reaction is unique to people with a more severe dopamine imbalance, i.e. people with Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective. Do you think he is onto something or is he trying to just get me on an AP for a kickback? I could see if I was in my 20’s and if he was trying to pre-emptively or trying to diagnose someone before a major psychotic break but I am 44, been holding down a really good professional job for about 22 years and I have never even been hospitalized (I’m naturally a loner so no one would really know if I am unwell except my wife and she is mentally ill but more chronically as in conspiracy theorist type). The stuff he calls psychosis may or may not be psychos
is. Yeah it was some weird thinking but no one was around to challenge my thinking so I am not sure how strong my convictions were at the time (someone has to show you proof you’re wrong and you still believe it, right?). It lasted 3-4 months, I was manic/hypomanic and all but the very last week was pleasant (I was a therapist, a prophet, I befriended a tree that became an antenna to god). The last week sucked but I’d rather deal with one week of hell every 10-12 years than take something that is going to cause negs. I think I might have said too much to him and was too honest. The last week started with severe paranoid/persecutory delusions where I thought I did a bunch of drugs at work and was high and everyone was looking at me funny, then the police were following me and I had a body in the back of my car. Then I felt guilty for several days and thought I was the anti-christ. I tried to tell him it wasn’t a deity thing, it was a guilt/shame thing where christ was everything good and perfect and I wa
s the opposite/inverse. I had no intentions of destroying the world. If I had to say it over again I would say “inverse-christ” I guess. Should I find another psychiatrist?"
174378996,"For me it’s both positive and negative symptoms. A huge factor is getting motivated to go to work (especially first shift). Once I’m at work it’s usually okay. Another factor is delusional thinking. I tend to think my co-workers are plotting against me. Especially when I have idiots for co-workers. At my new job I’ve been at for a month I haven’t had those issues (except motivation). And sometimes I’ll get to the point I’ll start having hallucinations at work. I have worked two very toxic jobs that brought out my psychosis. I think the mitigating factor is the type of work. If it’s a highly mentally taxing job, I can’t do it with paranoia, delusions and hallucinations coming back. Physical jobs are fine. My current job is security at a casino which is extremely easy…so far."

176144294,"I was really stable for a few years so my doctor agreed we could slowly get me off meds. Within a month I was the most psychotic I have ever been. In and out of psych ward for the next year. Almost lost everything. Lost my job, list my car, list my apartment, almost lost my husband, lost all my savings, lost retirement fund. Everything. Finding a med that worked after that took many years of trial and error. Worst decision of my life."

176144303,i tried really hard to feel how i felt without intellectualizing today… and everytime i got paranoid that i would hear voices i told myself it was ok and came back to the present. but i basically had to do it constantly all day. i only worked an hour but im so exhausted that it feels like ive worked 8.

176144305,"I have always been able to think pretty clearly. I’ve always been able to make sense and a part of me has always known what is happening even at my worst. I have delusions and paranoia but a part of me is very sane. I wish I could bottle it like _PERSON_ did, I could make a fortune."

174378997,I feel as if I am not real most of the time. Reason why I say this is… I remember in my head a scenario which happened a month ago. I had went to my garden to open the shed gate to pull our recycle bin back into the yard which our neighbour very kindly brings to the gate for us every week. At that time I saw my neighbour sitting on a “step” facing my direction in her garden. Tonight when I was in my garden. I looked behind my gate and realised there was no “step” in my neighbours garden. Did I imagine this whole scenario?? It feels like I did now. And I’m realising it may have been a hallucination at the time. I’m not scared… Just concerned that I’m so ill. Or am I just overthinking things too much? Can anybody relate? I really don’t understand this schizophrenia. Wish I didn’t have it. At the same time it’s part of me. But it’s not all that I am either.
174379005,I show you that things can get better. You never know when and how
176144308,"I was hardly doing anything before I got sick at age 19. I got out of high school at 17 and just partied and had a string of jobs working at restaurants, gas stations and department stores. I really had no plans for the future, I never had a lot of money and dropped my friends on my own accord. I don’t want to put myself down too much because I did have a lot of fun in those days and once I got my first car I had a lot more."

176144312,I had an intense episode a few days ago and I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and intrusive thoughts ever since. I always set the recovery time after a major breakdown as two months because my psychosis doesn’t resolve itself quickly. I’m having bugs crawl on me and the voices want me to jump off the building. I can’t go to the hospital because of a widespread coronavirus outbreak. Hospitals are seriously the most dangerous places you could go to right now… What can I do to keep myself from this decline? I don’t want to struggle. Everything feels like pain.

176144322,I was on Depixol. An injection once a month. Now I’ve switched over to 2 mg of Risperidone a day. I find I’ve been eating less. Is this because of med change? What’s others experiences?

174379007,"Plenty of people go through trauma without experiencing psychosis. 12 is when you start becoming a teen, and schizophrenia can manifest in the teenage years.

176144326,I am so stressed. I don’t have enough money to survive. I’m so scared.
174379013,I think it’s important that as a mod you have lots of experience with schizophrenia and different ways people have become stable. The best mods are the ones who are open and spend most of their time making sure that no one is being attacked and that conversations are staying healthy.

We are having Sweet Asian BBQ chicken and fresh green beans. I’ll try to remember to take a photo. It’s healthy AND delicious! Despite the energy drinks this morning, I am proud of myself for avoiding soda lately. I used to drink it daily, but now when we go into the convenience store, I get ice water instead from one of their fountain machines. I love ice water, which makes the transition from root beer a lot smoother."
176144331,"I went to Wal-_NAME_ at 6am this morning to buy half & half creamer and Cheerios for my elderly mom. I went super early to avoid crowds and for social distancing purposes.

Fortunately, I don’t currently need any of those products but I just found the completely empty shelves in some sections of the store such a bizarre sight."
174379017,That should really do the trick. The Clozapine dose is low though so you could always go up on that. It might be worthwhile mentioning what you’re going through to your psychiatrist and see what they say about the Clozapine dose.
176144332,"But the real question is, did those things make you happy? We can all have all the things in the world but whether our parents are successful or not doesn’t mean that even they are happy. Trauma’s can go undetected because some/most people live a facade."

176144338,Update I took excedrin (which has a good amount of caffeine in it) and the brain fog cleared up pretty quick so I think I can confirm it is due to caffeie withdrawal.

176144345,"Yeah, I wouldn’t do it"
176144346,My voices I had tortured me but I don’t have them anymore. Maybe when I started a activity house and started work there etc I think I was not hearing voices anymore then but became annoyed a my neighbours instead although they did no wrong really. I stopped smoking around the same time my voices stopped. I don’t know what madethem stop. I had them less and less I think and then it stopped. I had voices for years. They said agonising words 24/7 n gunshots n moans etc

What are you looking at me for they may think. I don’t think it will get you into a fight. Just try to look away. Are you interested ? show interest but not at a man’s wife or girl friend. Its type of hunger to get to know people and to build up to talking to them. But if you aren’t going to then don’t look. I know it is uncomfortable and you really can’t help it some times but try to be good.

Everything, absolutely everything was ignored. And for doing so I just took some time to realize how stupid these thoughts are, because they’re irrational. That’s it."

176144383,"I remember when he first made it big on Welcome Back Kotter. He was a good looking guy and then became the stand-out of the show and then became a legitimate star with Grease and Saturday Night Fever. The women loved him but it’s kind of funny because there’s a medical condition (I forget what it’s called) where a persons facial features become exaggerated and the nose, mouth and the cheeks become prominent. Some historians say that _NAME_ had this condition but they aren’t a 100% sure. But looking at _NAME_ in his early years it almost looks like he had that condition. At his peak he was an A-lister, he was very popular and a legitimately good actor. Then the rumors about his sexuality started floating around and his behavior with male masseurs came to light. I guess he survived those rumors and still made movies but it caused his marriage to go on the rocks. He’s had a great career though."

176144399,"That’s a great way of looking at it! Go you! There is a popular meme that makes its way around the Sparkpeople site - “a year from now you’ll wish you started today.” Slow is the best way to lose. I am losing about six pounds a month, less than two pounds a week. This week I happened to lose 2.2, but usually it’s more like 1.5. I just make one good decision at a time and then wait for them to add up. I have made my way of eating - a mostly vegetarian lifestyle - something that I will still be doing once I reach my goal weight. I will just be able to eat about 300 more calories a day than I do now. I did some research online and I will be able to eat 1600-1700 calories a day to maintain my weight at 160. I am easily handling 1400 so the 1600-1700 will be fine. I intend to still be on Sparkpeople tracking my nutrition even after I hit maintenance. The commitment to health will still be there in full force. If you’re curious about your maintenance calorie range, you can go to the Mayo Clin

176144400,That sounds like a winning combo!
176144401,"The best method I found to protect myself from relapse is to check my thoughs when I suspect there might be something going on. The trick is to backtrack you thought and ask yourself why am I thinking about this right now? For istance if you think about dinner or food, maybe it’s as simple as your hungry. A bit more advanced is if you think of someone you went to school with many years ago, probably you were thinking about something else about school, or something similar just before, or earlier the same day or the day before. For me the warning is when I can’t backtrack my thoughts, if they just come out of the blue. But I never panick right away. Because sometimes it’s as simple as you can’t remember what you thought about before, or maybe the connection between previous thoughts is too vague to comprehend. But if it starts to happen with a lot of thoughts at the same time, like I can’t backtrack anything I’m thinking about at multiple occasions the same day, usually something is wron
g. This has happened to me when I have tried to quit medication in the past. When I’m on medication I have had no trouble backtracking my thoughts.

174379044,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effects of Roluperidone (MIN-101) on two dimensions of the negative symptoms factor score: Reduced emotional experience and reduced emotional expression. PD _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Sep 2019 02 Recent research has suggested that negative symptoms (NS) can be considered in terms of two different dimensions: reduced expression (expressive deficit) and reduced experience (experiential deficit). Roluperidone, a compound with high affinities for 5 HT2A and sigma2 receptors, has previously shown superiority over placebo on improving NS in a prospective study in patients with schizophrenia. The objective here is to explore the effect of roluperidone compared to placebo, on the 2 domains of the Negative Symptoms.This was a multi-national Phase 2b trial that enrolled 244 symptomatically stable patients with schizophrenia who had baseline scores ?20 on the NS subscale of the PANSS. Patients were randomized to daily monoth
erapy with roluperidone 32?mg, roluperidone 64?mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. All enrolled patients were Caucasian, and 137 (56%) were male. The 3 treatment groups were balanced on all demographic and illness-related baseline characteristics.Both doses of roluperidone were superior to placebo on both domains: Reduced Experience (p???.006 for the 32?mg; p???.001 for the 64?mg) with persistent superiority from Week 2 for the 64?mg dose and Week 8 for the 32?mg dose; Reduced Expression (p???.003 for 32?mg; p???.001 for 64?mg) with similar persistence.Both doses of roluperidone previously improved PANSS negative symptoms in general and demonstrated tolerability in stable schizophrenia patients. The post hoc analysis reported here found the drug to work on both the reduced emotional experience and reduced emotional expression sub-scales empirically derived from the PANSS."

I had stupidly ran up the balance on a few credit cards so I had about several thousand dollars in debt. We sat down and wrote out a budget and she took all my credit cards and kept them in her house and only gave me them on certain occasions. I gave her my online passwords for all my credit cards and the password to my checking account online. We agreed I would have $60 a month spending money and most of the rest of my money would go towards paying off my credit cards. She could login to my accounts anytime and see how I was doing with my money. Pretty soon, with her help, my tax refunds, and getting help with groceries from the food bank I paid off a $7000 debt in just three years and now I don’t owe anybody a dime and I have a couple thousand dollars in the bank. And now I’m back to managing my own money. My point is that many of us need help managing our finances occasionally. I know 
some of your reservations about moving into different housing like a group home or an apartment and I see why you don’t manage your own money but there are ways around it.

I’ve been in several group homes and they were very different. Different rules, different requirements. Also, the owners demand different stuff from a client. But personally, when I was in a group home in my thirties from 1990-95, those were my most productive years. I had just got clean from crack and I was working, I was going to school, I was going to 5 or 6 AA, CA, or NA meetings a week. I was visiting my sister on most weekends and hanging out with her and her friends. I had a friend at the house and we hung out or went and saw movies, or went to Tower records to buy CD’s and VHS tapes or simply hung out at the house and drank soda, listened to music and talked. I still had symptoms but I had an OK life. Some people at the group home spent the majority of their time smoking pot and drinking. If I was 17 that would have been 
fine for me but I had kind of outgrown it and I was a big proponent of AA to whoever wanted to listen. But to get back to my earlier point about different levels of functioning. It was all men and some people were really messed up, not many of them worked. But other people had jobs besides me. Degree of disability can be hard to gauge sometimes. Everybody has their strengths, and maybe all the guys who partied had more friends than me or more money. IDK. Group homes can be drastically different. I lived in one where there were strict rules and curfews and intense structure. The one I described above was hardly structured except we always ate together and followed a few simple guidelines like making your own bed, doing your laundry on weekends, didn’t leave messes anywhere, don’t bug other clients too much. But we had all the freedom we wanted."

Because today, parents and younger brother - two of whom have antisocial personality disorder - tried to have me sectioned because of the above I believe a lot of schizophrenia is caused by confused fear. And that’s the kind of environment I live with, growing up it was overly disciplinary _NAME_ sibling and parents and now it is parent, _NAME_ sibling and then even the immediately younger sibling. Bullying imo, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest “abusive” behaviours and actions increase psychotic risk Honestly, I comply with my medication near everyday recently and it is so annoying that I have to put up with this kind of funny business ; it’s not on at all Triggers create mayhem and then mayhem Turns to paranoia - I wish drs were trustworthy because they conveniently ignore trigger and association psychology and just focus on labels and medicinal symptomatic control concepts Not 
at all treatment of a disease - which is what it should be Counsellors are even worse; they just feed you goals or mind illusions to believe so that you conveniently ignore that there are underlying fears Of course this is all my opinion and not medical literature credible information at all Sorry to ruin anybody’s New Years, this lot, ruined mine ?"

176144524,"Yes I used to go to one. It was good then it got shut down due to funding. We are thinking of making a Watsapp group to keep us going. I miss them but at the same time I’m a bit too depressed to meet up atm. We had sharing about our week, then we would discuss something eg our hopes for the future or bring in music or something and then we’d end it by saying how the grp went today. I loved it. That was also wen I was off my meds so good times"

176144535,"My understanding is that the more psychosis episodes one has (whether from stopping meds or not) the more likely the psychosis will increase in duration or severity. That’s what I heard - maybe someone can confirm this… What is prognosis of sz/sza? Is it degenerative as I’ve heard from someone? Also, I heard from others on here and another group, that psychosis causes damage to the brain. How does it do this?"
176144536,I wish you were real. I wish I could see you and talk with you and listen to you. I wish I could feel connected to you. I wish we could take a walk. I wish it didn’t hurt this bad. I wish you could make it all go away.

176144540,"I think most kids these days know about sex, and I don’t really see it as an issue to discuss these things here.

174379068,"My mental illness is entirely feelings-driven. I feel terrorised. And in response, enraged about being terrorised. I do not hear disembodied voices. I do not have visual hallucinations. I do not have any delusions. I do not know why my psychiatrist diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I have psychotic symptoms that feel exactly the same as being abused by my narcissistic, sociopath mother as a kid. I feel like I’m trapped, being sadistically abused (as I was throughout my developmental years until I left home at 18). I fight back because I hate the abuse - that’s when I talk out loud to myself. I’m fighting back. I know that no-one is there, I know that reality is playing alongside this imaginary abuse horror, yet the feeling of being unfairly abused is more compelling than reality so I fight back and that’s when I talk out loud to myself. The ap’s? All they do is take my fear down a notch from terror to high anxiety. That’s it. They do not reduce my psychotic symptoms as described above. I
n answer to your question _AT_MENTION_, yup I don’t have voices as my major thing & don’t know why I’m diagnosed by pdoc with sz."
176144547,"I don’t think it’s safe to assume they’re spirits, especially of people you know. I used to think I was telepathically communicating with family members when I was in solitary confinement in jail, but then when I got out and talked to the family members and they didn’t remember any of the “conversations” we had in my head, I realized that I wasn’t ever really talking with them at all in my head. That was pretty much all the proof I needed. If the conversations were real they would have remembered them."

176144553,I’m beginning to feel better about how my voices said I’m going to hell forever. I’m beginning to believe this is truly a disease and my brain just wires in anything that I fear Idk why but theres probably a reason for it. I’m beginning to believe in either just the end or we eventually all end up in an eternal heaven. It makes me feel a bit better. It’s not a very solid belief yet but hopefully I will get there. Idk why I get this feeling but I feel like either it’s the end or u end up where u truly believe is the next realm so I really want to start believing in an eventual heaven for everyone at the last days whenever that is

And _AT_MENTION_ I don’t think having competitive nature makes one selfish, but that’s just my opinion. I AM an artist so to be honest I have been accused of being selfish by others in the past, just goes with the territory of promoting one’s self I think, but now in sports I feel unselfish to a fault. I can’t let the world walk all over me while I just let everyone else have all the fun or score the points, I have to get out there and play! In the end the world is hyper competitive and it’s there are few loyal folks in my experience. People are generally self concerned and only interested in you if you help them."

176144570,"I don’t care if I’m a narcissist or not. I’m probably not. Never been diagnosed in a billion lifetimes or more. Just some stupid, degree mill, revolving door, money hungry, old therapist who never helped me as a kid. My dad is the narcissist at least. He’s a good person and I love him. He’s only been diagnosed with OCD. But he abused me and my mom a little. My step-father on the other hand is probably a narcissist but he’s a changed person. He doesn’t talk much anymore. My brother even said he’s a narcissist. He’s a real Christian but comes off as a fake sometimes. I know he really believes that stuff though. They’re evangelicals. He used to lie all the time. Not as much anymore. When people age, they change. Seen it both times. The funny thing is my step-father has NEVER had therapy probably because he is a narcissist. I’ve had therapy a lot. They never brought it up at all. He refuses to go. Rather go down hill or turn to ???? than get help or help others. Out of a billion o
r trillion lifetimes, I only once or twice was diagnosed with anti social personality disorder. Probably because my psychiatrist was a ????? to me in a past life. Put me through MK-Ultra time travel program where I suffered thousands of times or more over and been through worse than hell. It was a government experiment in a parallel universe/past life. I volunteered for money. My life ended up being worth only $10 on average or something. I don’t care what people think of me or not. In a past life, some guy from the military told me I had _PERSON_ and I think they are smarter than 99.9999% of the population. Furthermore, I was in ROTC in a past life a long time ago and they kicked me out for drinking energy drinks in college – said I had Aspergers. I thought they were joking because _PERSON_ is autism. I told them I had ADHD. I don’t think I have ADHD though. Just because someone is a narcissist doesn’t make them a bad person. It’s the actions they do. Their behavior. I’m a nice guy. My personalit
y changes constantly. I even thought I had multiple personality disorder in a past life. Not sure. Never diagnosed. I’m constantly reincarnating. Came back alive in 2013 most likely. I usually die.

My other method… Trigger Warning - and I’m high functioning . . . . …is to deliberately think of several examples of my intrusive thought. Multiple instances for me means my mind can’t focus on one, so I count them all as cancelled. This in itself is probably me tricking my weak brain, and it’s also likely superstition but it usually works for me for typical intrusives. For strong intrusives I just proceed what I’m doing to spite them. I acknowledge them as ticks. Been doing it for 1 1/2 years and I haven’t spiraled out of control."

Since the walls are curved near the top, the distance traveled to get to the top would actually be longer than 30 m and the frog would not quite make it out on the 28th day before dropping back 2 m. The frog should make it out by climbing 3 m on the 29th day if the drawing is reasonably to scale.

176144670,"Hey y’all. Just had around 12 days of hypomania, then eventually got agitated and then I was getting a lot of intrusive images, seeing images of hands coming out of ceiling vents and stuff, just annoyances. My perceptions of other people’s behavior has been pretty off (accusing people of things) Then became exhausted and slept on off for a day. Now I’m back up again. Haven’t had longer manias since like 2013. So I’m just exercising my creative side. Learning about animating cartoons, and also learning about making some electronic music (trap music) and just writing fun lyrics. Key is keeping the hypomania contained and being vigilant about anything too off base. I keep my spending habits in check for the most part. Fortunately I have and understanding girlfriend, and my parents are pretty supportive. Been going to pdoc visits to figure out what I should do, was given Seroquel as prn, and just did 5 treatments of rtms. The rtms actually mellowed me out briefly but now that I’m done it I

174379123,"i hope that your next visits with your therapist are productive! good luck and have a restful week! _AT_MENTION_ DID is characterized by amnesiac barriers and the inability to function as a singular person in a single body (disrupting work, social life, school, driving, etc). DID treatment, as far as I know, is mostly system management with your therapist or psychiatrist, so that managing daily life with switches (alters changing) is easier to resume life rather than stutter or self destruct. (and thats just the surface of issues) some people speculate that if you give enough care to each alter, that the amnesiac barriers might break down, or you can integrate alters entirely, but i dont know how frequent or possible that is. i do know that some but not all anti-psychotics may blur systems and cause further memory disorder. i have DID, so I am open to any questions you might want to know about how a system functions, but I am nervous to talk about it publically (pm would be better)"
176144786,"I can remember two times of pure happiness. The first was from the time I was 4 years old until I was six years old. I had just gotten out of our house. My mom called this woman across the street, and she had a boy my age, so we were let out together, and life was a lot more fun. The other time was at college. I got started reading, and I quickly got to the point where all I did was read. The first thing I would do when I woke up was grab a book, and I’d read until I went to bed at night. It felt great. I’ve tried to duplicate that experience again, and all that reading bored me. It sure felt good the first time I did it."
176144787,I had about 9 one of them was a blow _NAME_ from a family friend when I was 9or 8she was 4 years older then me she still flirts with me to this day when we see each other
176144788,I’m confused by your demeanor and I don’t know what to do you say I’m getting meaner when really it is you I do not want us fighting I want this all to end I’ll tell you this in writing: you were once my friend
176144789,What happened? I finally have divine company
176144790,This is the first sound file on the forum I’ve actually listened to. It’s very calming. Did you make this with software?
176144791,"I think under normal circumstances you would be considered healthy and not get disability, unless you maybe got some irreversible side-effect from the drugs."
176144792,Yesss _AT_MENTION_ ! The Cult are my favorites!
176144793,I got mine when I was 16… I failed once… made a wide turn? then I got one here in Japan couple months ago. It was much stricter compared to the tests in the US. You drive cars on the left side of the road like UK and Australia.
176144794,I find myself flip flopping all over the place as a general rule. Mostly for minor things though.
176144795,I deleted it because it was inappropriate in my opinion.
176144796,"Hi! I will explain you quickly my problem. I have a paraphrenia, and the only treatment than works provokes an hypersexuality, which is very difficult to live with. I am currently looking for a solution to cut down this side-effect. Has someone faced the same situation and found a solution? Thanks a lot."
176144797,"I take CBD oil as part of my treatment. It seems to help with anxiety for me. Different people have different experiences. If you choose to try CBD (at age 21 when it is legal for you) make sure to get a lab report with any products you buy, to ensure they are THC free. Products that are lab tested are more expensive, but it is worth it to avoid the risk of relapse. And ask your doctor first."
176144798,I’m surprised there’s not a _NAME_’s Hide and Seek on here!
174379124,Why do you call yourself _AT_MENTION_ _PERSON_? Do you play piano?
176144799,They came to put me in the mental hospital ^^
176144800,Best wishes and positivity for your situation!
176144801,i h ope it all goes well for your sister Three. keep thinking positive–it helps. _NAME_
176144802,I dont believe in God but I believe in guardian angels. Spirits or beings that protect you from harm.
176144803,Sounds like you have to accept that you need your Meds. I suggest you stop stopping.
176144804,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ . That’s really awful. My life stopped when the men started harassing me in addition to recording and following me.
176144805,I’m due a change of circumstances decision on my pip. _PERSON_ if I will be accepted anymore cos it’s a positive change to my condition. Anyways if u feel u deserve the pip award u should defo appeal. Just be prepared that it may go to court but its nothing to be afraid of (like I initially was) if u feel u deserve it. Its also nothing to be stressed over as long as u prepare ur reasons cos its easy to get nervous and blank out so if I need to appeal I will definitely prepare. Good luck if you decide to go ahead with the appeal. A letter from gp can really help if u could get one… Like a healthcare professional
176144806,"I take 15mg a day, with the option to take an extra 5mg if I feel symptoms breaking through. I love it, my voices have gone from a crowd picking on me horribly, down to simple phrases, my name, not nearly as distressing as they used to be. Main side effect is that I have to be very diligent about my weight, it can easily get out of control."
176144807,It’s not that I’m expecting anything particular to happen but I just don’t feel safe. What creates a sense of safety?
176144808,You are a such fighter. It has been over 30 years now. I think they got more experienced psychiatrists in the field. What med did it finally stop your voice? I think I read it somewhere on the forum but I forgot.
176144809,That’s funny
176144810,"omg im still recovering, from this med like 2 years off it, made me gain 65 pounds, gave me diabetes, and high blood pressure and high triglycerides. But it work great more my mental health thought but the side effects suck so i had to switch."
176144811,Under heavy stress I can become psychotic.

176144814,Thanks for the important info _AT_MENTION_
176144815,"anytime before 11 pm, the early the better. sleep early, wake up early and start the day."
176144816,Thank you for your service!!
174379128,Maybe your regular dr will let you try clozapine. Good luck!
176144817,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ You’re so sweet, as well. You’re going through a major set of changes in your life, yet here you are, supporting others. I’m thinking I’m the lucky one to have YOU in my corner! Thanks so much!"
176144818,I eat fast food 2 to 4 times a month depending on how my budget allows.
176144819,No one has “gone” mad. Everybody was that way all along.
174379129,Look on the right side of each of the postings… It even states what episode #…
176144820,one way is to just accept that things wont be perfect. Then to work through it and learn to manage the best you can with different healthy coping strategies. Try to stay positive but also objective.
176144821,"ok, thank you, I might renege. It’s no big deal."
176144822,"Those close to me know, other people I just say jokingly “my brain thing” and give a silly face. They normally don’t ask beyond that"

176144825,"Hope you don’t leave. I really have enjoyed your content. But, do whats the best for you."
174379130,"My posts may be not easy to read because English is not my mother language. Medications did not prevent my coincidences. New coincidences happened despite taking meds. I suppose that I may not have diagnosis of schizophrenia (especially paranoid schizophrenia) because of diagnosis of _PERSON_’s syndrome. I was “odd”, “strange”, “other”, “bizarre” since childhood. I was quite regularly diagnosed with schizotypal disorder (F21 in ICD-10) since 2015. I was “crazy” before coincidences. I had schizophrenia diagnosis only for some time in 2016, when I had not diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder. I have also diagnosis of OCD and take meds for it since above 10 years (but earlier not regularly, often I did not take them at all). When I was about 12 - 15 years old, I had many controlling compulsions associated with magical thinking and I did not think about their as something which is obviously false, I rather have OCD without insight when I had no contact with psychiatrists. 
I read that OCD symptoms (especially bizarre ones) may be present before onset of schizophrenia, be a sort of prodromal symptoms of it. Treating “magical” obsessions and compulsions as something sinful, occult, witchcraft-like appears to reduce or even prevent them in my case. But similar OCD symptoms occurred in my life and still occur (I have obsessive or compulsive oathing now, earlier I had promising). About being 16 years old I started to have “suspiciousness” about people outside my family (that they kill, poison me). I do not believe in it, it looks rather as “cautiousness”. I have no friends and even colleagues since about 12 years, which is not so painful for me, but having not own wife is mentally unpleasant for me."
176144826,"I take 400mg Amisulpride in the morning, and 600mg at night."
176144827,"I always thought i thought mostly in words, almost exclusively. But i found out i express myself, my feelings, much better with pictures. Which is odd."
176144828,I was homeschooled the last 2 years of high school.
176144829,once you take it or sometime after 2 weeks or months depend on your case and your respond to meds
176144830,I dunno…there are all kinds of free games on the internet if you look for them. It might be something that you can occupy your time with so that you aren’t constantly thinking about homicide/suicide. I think maybe you have too much free time to think.
176144831,"Ikr Many szics are homeless forever, some catatonic living in mental hospital forever and some commit suicide."
176144832,"In ancient times things were much different, people married at 13 years old so it was not a problem. Also there were no reliable contraceptives or abortion and I assume the situation was very bad for single mothers."
176144833,Dont ditch your meds. I still may need them. I can’t recommend anything herbal I am sorry.
176144834,"My sleep patterns have been changing lately. I’ve been getting so sleepy early in the evening that I’ve been laying down before meds and falling asleep then waking up for a couple of hours, taking meds and going back to bed for a few more hours. I used to take meds sleep for a few hours and be up for a couple hours then fall back asleep. I’m backwards now lol. Honestly I’m sleepy all the time now it seems. I’ve even been falling asleep sitting up for a few minutes. My ex ex used to fall asleep where ever, when ever. I used to hate that. I felt so abandoned by him when he would just fall asleep in the middle of something. I damn near thought he had narcolepsy lol. Now I’m falling asleep sitting up. I’m turning into what I hate. Omg."
176144835,"Well, they responded with incorrect answers. I accused them of lying to and manipulating me, but one voice said something along the lines of “just because we can’t do math in their heads doesn’t mean they aren’t real,” which is technically true, except they don’t need to do any math as they claimed to have access to all knowledge, only they weren’t permitted to share all knowledge with me. They tried to trick me with that, but I wasn’t buying it because, when those arrogant bas tards knew something, they weren’t shy about it. They always say I’m not allowed to know."
176144836,"I wanted to verify that you were having trouble with the language and not just thinking in general. Your thinking is probably fine if you can manage a decent conversation in english. I’m sorry if I made you wonder. Your english is a bit rough, but if its not your native language its much more understandable why that is."
176144837,"Hi, _AT_MENTION_ ! I hope you’re starting to feel better. Take care."
176144838,"is the house haunted? I believe in some of that stuff. If I recall, you seem young, why aren’t you out having fun?"
176144839,It looks like _NAME_’s work
176144840,Maybe it’s a way you relieve yourself from something subconscious? Maybe it’s a good thing instead of bottling up those expressions. At least when it’s only when you write.
176144841,"Since my first real psychosis, in the end of 2009, until today, I’ve been in hospital most of the time, with some time intermittently discharged, and with recurrent (maybe once a month) holidays. I know, it’s crazy, especially given how modest my symptoms are: no dangerous delusions, no suicidality, and I’ve been angry only a few times, and without hurting anyone. -_NAME_."
176144842,"I wouldn’t, when I have to explain myself like that I just tell them “oh I’ve got a brain thing” in a playful way, make a silly face and try to change the subject. If they push me even further I take that as prying and I don’t like that. I also wouldn’t go around telling everyone I’m sick, it’s just bad manners. Only people that know is my family, my fiancée, my _PERSON_, and you guys. I don’t need people knowing, it’s just a headache"
176144843,but sometimes i wonder how there life worked out
176144844,"But how to make the world go back to the dark ages? The only way is to destroy technology and it can be done too with EMP bombs, but you also would have to live without electricity."
176144845,"My voices tell me things about me that aren’t true, like I’m addicted to Valium. And I just agree with them like sure why not they always say “you’re not supposed to agree with us” easy way to catch them out"
176144846,"As directed by one of my pdcocs I’ve been taking ap’s at night and I sleep pretty good, when I used to take them in the day my morning was zapped and I had insomnia."
176144847,I am Chinese nice to meet you
176144848,yum-o pizza. My package didn’t come so dinner is going to be salad probably.
176144849,I do pretty good but a reason is I take my meds religiously. I don’t even consider stopping them. I’m multi episodic so that usually means meds for life or until better med tech.
176144850,"Yes, I tend to get tired and irritable from too much stimuli. When I was younger I’d get so worn down from too much stimuli, I’d have violent uncontrollable meltdowns."
174379132,Were you religious before schizophrenia?
176144851,My psychiatrist told me Monday it’s officially a spectrum disorder in the new DSM
176144852,That’s really cool ! Good work.
176144853,I Hope you feel better soon _AT_MENTION_
176144854,"I wish I had that. When I used to drive, I drive at 200kmh on the highway and was never caught by the police. I had a deadly accident once at 200kmh during a snowstorm. I am crazy I know."
174379136,"This is interesting and I think highly likely in many cases. When I was first diagnosed I was in my 40s and later found out I was severely Vit D deficient I also had a lot of food sensitivities. As I got my levels of Vit D up and changed my diet, my symptoms improved. Not cured but a LOT better and I am currently not on medications except for Vitamins and dietary. I no longer hear voices from the TV and my main issues are agoraphobia–and stress around people. Being in a high stimulus environment will result in me having hallucinations also if I mess up and eat gluten by mistake I get a whole rush of symptoms."
176144855,"I hope your dad is ok, and that you feel better soon _AT_MENTION_"
176144856,I understand that nicotine fits perfectly into a one or more than one neural receptors.
174379144,"I saw a research video (I can’t find the video now) that postulated that _PERSON_ is a type of Groundhog Day life where the patient is not able to unlearn the psychosis and delusions due to a lack of, or abnormal, REM sleep. The patient might unlearn them a little during the daytime but cannot consolidate the learning at night and so is back to square one the following day. I tried to pick up on this theory by trying megadoses of EMDR using a YouTube emdr cursor video. I’ve done around 7 or 8 thousand hours of emdr and my meds dose has reduced by around 75%. I knew the technique was working early on because I started having very vivid dreams at night."
176144857,Hope it works out for you!
174379139,"My voices used to make me think high schools around the country were reading my stupid thoughts while i was abusing drugs – as well as my sex life - they called me ‘piglet’ - I thought someone was using spells to create an illusion of schizophrenia … I was so messed up I could not count out my monopoly money at the psych ward … These days, it’s all warfare and visions about God and so on … However the voices still make fun of me - they know every failure, every fear honestly I feel very low in self esteem I’m like an inch tall …"
174379134,There’s not much published on it. In the 1b study they are mostly looking at safety and tolerability. Other M4 drugs have been described as targeting positive and cognitive symptoms with limited side effects and better safety. But none has yet made it to late stage trials.
176144858,"good to see you. Hope the sobriety is going well. I really wasn’t expecting this post when I clicked on it. It’s quite emotionally charged. Original poster, love stinks. ha."
176144859,Losing value of my words.
176144860,It’s ficked my head up
176144861,Have you tried quetiapine I’m on 600 mg now and I seem to be making progress maybe you might too
176144862,"maybe its something else going on.i dont know.one sideffects i get high temperature.i take a tablet and after couple of hours i get really hot.high body temeprature,even in winter.but you are right solian is very stimaulating for me.its almost like a stimulant.antidepressant.also i get weird tongue movement and memory problems.thanx for replaying and helping.i appreciatet it."
176144863,Any medication could help with that ? I shocked from such experience Horrible Seeing thing that’s not true Not seeing things that’s there …very hard experience What to do ? Visual hallucinations are very torturous I can be considered blind
176144864,"I mean stress is more likely affecting your mental health as well as increasing your blood pressure. Try to relax as much as possible and take care of your physical health, too."
174379148,"Honestly, Latuda should be just below Clozapine in effectiveness IMO"
176144865,Just curious to know
176144866,"Yeah, it might be good to try to see him/her earlier. Do you find it hard to do things to distract yourself from your symptoms? If not, that might be the best way to deal with them for now. Sometimes there’s nothing to be gained from focusing on them too much."
176144867,"I have had a depression and was recently treated with 8 ect treatments. It didn’t help. But if you have had the experienced it helped you previously, then give it a go. Otherwise - if your problem is depression and the AD meds don’t help, then ask you pdoc if an MAO- inhibitor (AD meds) could help you. It’s the only AD that works for me, but it’s a complicated treatment. Good luck."
176144868,I was just remembering. It’s all swirly and noisy and there’s lots of images and trying to make sense of it all. It a lot to deal with. With medicine it’s so orderly and sane. I’m really happy they have medicine for psychosis. I’m really lucky.
176144869,Yeah I’ve been on a few. How many times have you been in hospital?
176144870,Ooh that’s a bit risky. If you smoke weed again when voices are gone. They might come back. They might not. It’s a bit of a risk but if you think it’s worth it then I’m not going to stop you.
174379141,I had a casual job for a few months but struggled to keep it due to depression and avolition. Soon after I married and stopped work. That was eight years ago. I’m a painter and writer but struggling with working on that. Haven’t painted in five months. If I can’t paint or write regularly then I doubt I can hold a job which requires more commitment - especially if I have to work away from home.
176144871,They only give shallow tips that anyone on the street could give.
174379154,some of that fixation I’ve heard before in my research.
176144872,The truth is that nothing knocks me out. Even huge doses of aps. Maybe because I am obese
176144873,My family always treats me like ???? just because I can never complete school or because I don’t work anymore. They say I’m a useless weight to my mother and that I was created for no reason. I have many family members that treat me like this and this is also the reason why I broke it off with past friends. I just feel like I’m a burden to my family. I don’t complete school because it’s just not easy for me like learning and memorizing things is just really hard for me. I can’t work right now because I’m not mentally stable enough to have the responsibility of a job. And yes I do tell them this but they just make fun of me and call me useless.
176144874,"I’m not bipolar either so it’s not mania. I’m just wondering about it though. Who knows? Maybe I’ve just adjusted to my meds. Before meds, I smiled a lot."
176144875,Yeah I let a lot of this stuff go on for too long and thought it was my fate to be in a sunken place being tortured. But I’m starting to come back to life and feel like my old self. I’ve realized that from the point of view someone else can’t see the things I carry and the things I deal with and that what is nothing to me would crush someone else. But idek it’s like the world turns on me at the blink of an eye.
176144876,"I don’t know you very well, but i’m glad you are doing well. If its the meds you can look forward to many happy returns of this day. Be well while counting your blessings and be thankful."
174379140,You’re an adult; it’s up to you. I often say that we may have schizophrenia but we still have choices. It’s a big world and we are free to explore and take our time to find what we are good at and to find what we are intrested in. You always seem to be doing productive things and exploring your interests so stick with what you are doing because it’s working. As schizophrenics we have unique obstacles in life but if you could somehow make a list of the interesting things people on this site do it would be a helluva a long list.
176144877,I second late night surfer. Medication is important and helpful when you get it right. And meditation by means of principle would probably speed up the process because oxygen is always needed for cell functioning. Drinking water and exercise within reason would help the body to heal too.
176144878,"I usually have bad thoughts that seem involuntary. I just remind myself it’s not my fault that my thoughts are uncontrollable sometimes. Thoughts really don’t matter, they’re fleeting, they can be random and non sense. Stop attaching such meaning to them"
176144879,my pdoc raised my AD. try it?
174379149,Thanks yes I’d say the clumsiness awkwardness etc… cam be a sign of many things. I saw several neurologists over the years and none of them found any underlying neurological condition so it must be all psychiatric which I find difficult to digest. My psychiatrist told me he saw people end up in wheelchairs with somataform disorder. I have the unwanted thoughts and the clumsiness and awkwardness plus very bad anxiety as well. Maybe the anxiety is causing the physical problems. Happy New Year to you too. Stay safe and healthy.
176144880,"if you said to your pdoc, “if you don’t put me in the hospital, im going to do something bad to get there”. i don’t want to do anything bad, but sometimes i think about making this threat to my pdoc."

176144885,here are my five carrier pigeons.
176144886,"You’re right. He knows there’s treatment, he just doesn’t want it. I shall let him leave without saying much to him."
176144887,"I got put on _PERSON_ for seasonal depression. Then nurse said she’ll check in next friday to hear if there’s been any side effects and such. I don’t want to read the label as I’ll end up thinking I have everything, but is there anything I need to be aware of? Anything that stuck out with you?"
176144888,"Yeah I’m living in his house, it’s a year wait for government housing so that’s not really an option _AT_MENTION_ And thanks for that info _AT_MENTION_"
176144889,That’s rare from what I understand. I was specifically put on Cymbalta because mania was unlikely since I kept going manic on everything else. I’m maxed with no signs of mania all summer and I was so happy about that.
176144890,I was just trying to say to not give up the fight against illness by stopping your meds.
176144891,My mother spoke volumes of verbal hatred toward people. The fact that some of those people hated her back seemed to her to be somehow unfair. Hmmmmm. I’m sure there is a technical term for this. What is it?
176144892,"I’m looking for my mouse traps, think i seen one in the house, killer mouse, I may be doomed as it eats my flesh while I sleep Killer-mouse900×600 77.2 KB"
176144893,Yes but not the best due to my severe negative symptoms.
176144894,No it’s not mania. It’s spiritual ecstasy. I had it since childhood. Tonight TV has Matrix revolutions. Should I watch it or not?
176144895,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, I’m starting to feel a lot of twitches in my hands and legs at night. Maybe that’s the start of akathisia?"
176144896,Can someone post how to make a poll? I forgot.
176144897,I don’t think it’s a good idea especially if you don’t have low testosterone levels. You could be harming yourself by supplementing on your own. Not a good idea.
176144898,It’s the internet and some people don’t know so you shouldn’t take what people say on the internet as truth. These sorts of questions should be addressed to your medical team. There’s some patterns in your behavior here that is upsetting people. Please remember whilst your experiences are real and important so are other members who post here. I have just shut down basically the same thread and will do so here.
176144899,"I like my voices as well, they can be very positive. I include them in my support group. Although, when I was in full psychosis sometimes it was overwhelming. It wouldn’t stop even when I was tired. It was like having a TV on that only I could see through my eyes viewing constant footage and commentary. I called it dreaming while awake."
176144900,"So firstly I have gone from job to job because I’ve struggled to keep jobs. Like even now I am not going to work because the paranoia got so bad. Secondly , even my dad was on disability whilst working. The Rules are different here."
176144901,Sounds like mania or hypomania to me
176144902,"All kinds of cheating are wrong, not just cheating on your partner. Lying to get ahead, learning geometric mathematical principles with your clubhouse pals, trying to rat out others so you can look like the star student, trying to date someone out of your league just because they have attractive qualities, using unethical practices in business, and in general not learning to know your place.

176144919,"If a TV/radio presenter named an internet medical forum on air and asked people to write the ideal medicines in it, out of the millions of people listening including thousands of doctors, there would be some new suggestions that save lives. The presenter could ask the audience to name the forum on every other channel on Earth. There would be better medicines suggested. Who wants to help me? I know people who are dying. Their cancer has spread and this is their only chance. If you know someone who is dying and has no chance then try my idea if you don’t have any others - it costs nothing. On Facebook find a celebrity who you can message (most B-list celebrities and presenters have a message option on their page). Message them asking them to help with this idea (you could copy and paste this and/or send the link). Then post below who you messaged and I will message them as well. With two people messaging, the celebrity is likely to help and we will succeed. Surely any idea is worth trying for this.

176144968,It really helps to have a positive attitude to things. How that practically helps you when your down is seriously a moot point but still. I subscribe to a half glass full for sure.
176144969,"So one of the things that has allowed me to have longer periods of sanity is avoiding triggers. I used to think I couldn’t identify them, but then I realised that some of the things I spent most of my time on were actually triggers. They didn’t trigger immediately but the build up of spending prolonged periods of time on them triggered me in the end. A few of these things are politics, racism and sexual insecurity. These things are difficult to avoid, so other than putting them out of my mind completely, there is a question of moderating how I interact with them. The first thing I did was to stop reading Cuban news and commenting on it in internet discussions. That helped a lot. Cuba really is at the extreme of politics, at least with respect to the political reality of the UK where I live. This also cut out quite a bit of my obsession with dealing with racism, both how it affects me and how it affects others, as many of the political discussions I was having revolved around this. With sexual i
nsecurity, the issue was different, here I wasn’t talking about it at all, just letting me insecurity revolve around and around in my head and feeding it with porn. I had been trying to cut down on porn use for a long time, but I finally joined an internet community that allowed me to start to explore these issues out in the open and really make progress towards curing my neurosis with regards to porn. Returning to politics, I have on occasion re-engaged with some of the issues that I was obsessed with on other places on the internet. These last few days I have been doing it again, this time with some Rastas, and I need to stop before it consumes me and starts to trigger me again. Another thing I need to do is stay away from material on conspiracy theories. In an email conversation about how chakras and energy work could help with my recovery, I was sent a link to a spiritual healer who claimed to have been brought up by aliens and be the son of an NSA/MI5 officer and grandson of an MI6 officer, not to ment
ion Free _NAME_. Against my better judgment I listened to one of his podcasts and this disturbed me. I need to stay away from such things. I am now dealing with sex in a much more healthy way, although I am still largely repressed. Staying away from politics, and ignoring the racism I experience and see in life is also helping. I need to refocus on my recovery, and become more proactive in getting to a better position in life in a realistic way, prioritising practical things that are within my power to achieve. As I said, the last few days, I haven’t been doing this, or rather I have been mixing this with triggering activity, so I need to cut that out again. Hopefully I can get back to an even keel, it is not that long since my last relapse. Thank you."
176144970,What do you take it for? Intrusive thoughts by any chance?
176144971,sorry you have those visual hallucinations they can be very scary indeed
176144972,"That reminds me more of my delusion, it was very intrusive at the time i wholly believed it. I think some of it was because my neighbor was schitzo before I was and he thought I was a agent of some kind I could hear him for months trying to convince himself “hes not CIA” then again maybe I was slightly schizo at the time and didnt realize it but it started with some guy defected from the CIA and they wanted him back but he was secretly brainwashing me to take his place and say it was me. Then as they were attacking me with Drones in the sky with secret laserbeam technology I was lasting longer than anyone else ever did so we soon realized I was the trainer but brainwashed to think I wasnt. The telepaths that could brainwash had taken over the CIA and had everyone in a loop brainwashing each other until thats all they did and did nothing else so they were in a loop and needed help. Somehow I woke them up yelling “Wake Up” and then fought to make up other things that would wake them up from b

Once you’ve been stable for a while, you can work on being more self-reliant. For now, take all the help you can get and focus on finding a way to feel better."

176145022,"Grounding is what I find most helpful. Some other techniques you can try Try to count things! Pick an object or color and try to find things that match description. for example, count and name everything you can see that is blue. Another is try to describe your surroundings in extreme detail! Describe the colors of the walls and the furniture in the room how bright it is etc. Another thing is drink something cold the sensation helps Those are just some things that help me! Hope things improve for you"

174379177,Uhhh she has not been that helpful honestly but I am not sure how much I like her as a therapist she doesn’t seem that knowledgeable in or experienced with actual mental illness and more seems like the kind of therapist who mostly sees people for mundane life problems. I’m probably going to stop seeing her soon. The main negative symptom I get that I feel impacts me the most negatively is lack of motivation. What helps me the most with it is making things routine. It takes 2 weeks of serious struggling forcing myself to do things and then it becomes a habit and I don’t have to think about it anymore i just do it. Sometimes when I am having an extra hard time working up the willpower to do something in the beginning I ask my boyfriend to come do the thing with me because it is easier for me to do things if someone else is doing them with me. So if you have a supportive friend or family member or partner you can use them as a crutch until you make something a habit and can do it on your own.

176145036,I like ground coffee better than instant coffee. When I was off medication I could not handle ground coffee because it was too strong and my heart would pound and race. Now I’m on medication I can handle strong coffee and it doesn’t effect my heart one bit. That’s one thing I like about meds. Coffee raises dopamine and so does tea. I think tea raises my dopamine way worse than coffee though. It’s because tea contains l-theanine and that really raises dopamine. I tried l-theanine and I had the worst racing heart I though I was gonna die. But yes coffee can cause paranoia in me when I’m not taking medication.

Some of his stories about his childhood were like they were from the twilight zone. I only saw a couple of signs that he might be a psychopath, but nothing really strong. Of course, we were both on a locked down ward of all guys, so maybe in that environment his bad side didn’t show. There was a lot about him that was very human, but I think it would be impossible for him not to carry any baggage from his childhood."

That is one scenario I hope any new drug addresses.

I have thrown away 40 books last year. I would give them to my sister and her husband but I only see them once or twice a year. And if I see that my shelf is full it’s like an impulse and the books have to go. It’s really poor. Because couple weeks or months later I had an urge to read some books I’ve thrown away.

When I first got sza it was very gradual - started with anxiety and two years later voices and delusions then two years later depression and hypomania and two years later my breakdown When I relapsed in 2012 it started with anxiety and depression and the psychosis only came some months later in form of paranoia. Then the voices only came a year or two later. Now I get voices more and unusual beliefs and paranoia. But as I’m on meds the depression and mood swings aren’t so bad and psychosis not so bad either. Off meds I am worse than before. Severe depression and agitation and rapid, hectic mood swings - and psychosis. Thank goodness my meds work! Lately I think I got worse because my psychosis developed into a form where Alien the evil spirit tries to control me and wants to use me to kill things so off meds I’d be a little bit of danger to myself and maybe others.

This drug, however, is associated with adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and blood dyscrasias. The manifestations of mental illness may differ between men and women. Yet, there is little evidence on the influence of sex on treatment response or the occurrence of AEs. To fill this gap of knowledge, we carried out a systematic review of the literature on sex differences in the effectiveness and adverse effects of clozapine. Scant evidence has been published on differences in effectiveness of clozapine between men and women. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this issue has only been addressed in a published study. Regardin
g adverse effects, males have been reported to be more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities such as cholesterol or triglycerides, hypertension, and cardiovascular risk, while females are at a higher risk for gaining weight, developing diabetes, and needing laxatives. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of sex-based studies on this drug, further studies are needed to explore sex-based differences, as the results obtained may be crucial to clinical practice and help improve the quality of life of patients."

My therapist says he thinks I might have major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms, borderline personality disorder, and my major depressive may actually be bipolar. Sorry for the confusion"
176145271,"Its normal because I can’t work, can’t help in the house, can’t live on my own on disability bcz I will never bath and take care of myself. Its normal and I am really useless. My brothers both work, help in the house and even buy house stuff and gifts for my mother. I am also more annoying and needy than my brothers."
176145272,Yeah I’m hearing you. I’m almost hitting 50 but I’m fitter and more motivated than when I was 40. It’s a perspective thing for sure but why do you feel this way? It’s not natural to want to give up. Do you have underlying depression? Some negatives can really do that too. You’ve a lot in your life to live for. You really do. Don’t give up. Our natural instinct is to fight tooth and nail to survive. Giving up shouldn’t be an option!
176145273,"Yes. I try not to think about it, that’s the only way I can deal with it, is to occupy my mind with other things."

176145303,"Its the power of habit. Just like you are salve of bad habits you can also become slave of good habits. If you look at normal people you can see most of the activities they do daily are habits like going to bed and wake at same time, eating food at correct times, bathing regularly etc etc. If they disrupt the habit even for few days they too can become lazy to follow daily activities. So what I want to tell is don’t blame the illness for everything. There is always room for improvement if try."

They said it’s better to remain on my medication than come off it and get unwell cause the problem with me is when I’m unwell I’m very unwell and that will have more risk to the pregnancy than the medication. I’m on aripiprazole and a very small dose of qutiapine.

176145359,"It’s hard to tell when I first became psychotic as opposed to being ‘markedly different’. From an early age I was a loner and very introverted. Very withdrawn. There were no friends to lose, which is the opposite experience of many here. There was an experience around the age of 9 when a Chinese man came out of the clothes cupboard and said I’d have a long life.However there was no repeat of anything like that. Pre hospitalisation there was increasing depression and anxiety, with a marked drop in my schoolwork. Saying how much of that was autism related as opposed to ‘psychosis spectrum’ related is hard. I can have periods of being quite dismissive of having a ‘severe mental illness’. That can affect the process of looking back to see those 1st signs of psychosis. The counter argument to that dismissiveness is ‘Well you’ve been a service user for over 4 decades, so something must be going on’."

174379273,"Uh, take it from someone who has worked for more than 35 years while having schizophrenia. Having a job does NOT solve all your problems. It solves some of them and having a job is a positive thing most of the time. But what they told me in AA was that getting clean and sober and then fitting back into society with a job or school or whatever does not solve all your problems it just gives you a higher class of problems. And working with schizophrenia is the same way. When I first got sick at age 19 back in 1980, I was severely psychotic and depressed. I didn’t work for three years but then when I got a job and a car all of a sudden I had to work to maintain my car; i.e. pay for gas, oil, maintenance, repairs. Then I enrolled in college and I had to pay for books and other fees. And I had to drive miles to college and then I was spending time doing homework and I had tests and had to read textbooks. Anyways, I’m not trying to discourage you at all. Obviously there’s many benefits to being empl
oyed and doing other stuff in life. Your mom is probably a nice person but if she really thinks a job will solve all your problems than she is setting you up for disappointment and failure. My first job after getting diagnosed did not “cure” me. In fact, I was psychotic during many parts of it. I was really messed up at the time and then I got addicted to crack while there which did not help at all. I liked working but it is difficult. I have to deal with co-workers personalities and their problems sometimes. I have to be on time and of course I have to do a good job at whatever they ask me. BUT…I’m a janitor and I work in an Army reserve office building. I get to talk to the soldiers and most of them are really nice. I get to work alone, it’s rare that I work with my co-workers, usually I get there in the morning and punch in and then my boss tells me what I will be doing, like vacuuming or emptying wastebaskets and I go off on my own for most of the rest of the day. I love it."

176145390,To the kind and concerned people who suggest calling protective services I want to reassure you we are not in immediate danger. The house is run by a non-profit and overall they take pretty good care of us. They are not making tons of profit at out expense. To be honest I don’t even know if they are obligated to provide us the food that they do. I know some places aren’t. I have been organizing meals and we have not gone hungry I just don’t know that I can do it indefinitely and was feeling overwhelmed. I think they are doing the best they can with what they have and limited funding. I also like it here and have nowhere else to go at this point. The housing market is insane where I am. I want to see if something can be worked out. I don’t think it is at the point of getting authorities involved but I have informed people who can advocate for us effectively and are keeping an eye on the situation. It’s good to know my options though. I hadn’t considered that. Thanks.

176145398,"Caffeine helps my focus and energy level it’s really hard to quit something that helps. The doctor’s reasoning was it would help with disorganized thinking but my bf witnessed it, and was like OMG your all over the place without the caffeine, even worse.

You’ve survived all kinds of stuff I bet and someone who hears what you’ve done and what you’ve experienced could be helped. Of course you have something to offer; just a simple, kind, encouraging word or compliment, or being nice to someone else is very helpful and I’m sure you can at least do that."

176145432,"I’ve been having porn addiction my whole life. But the funny thing is that I don’t really want to watch it. It hurts me really bad, but I do it anyway. I think it’s some kind of unconscious self-harm. I know that I feel like crap every time I see it, yet I never seem to be able to snap out of it in the long run. I think I almost watched none when I had a gf, but after that I have never been able to stay away for more than a little over 3 months at best. It’s like I have a second personality that takes over and makes me watch it while the real me is kind of begging me to stop. Yesterday I thought briefly about killing myself because I lose all self-respect and nobody would want to be with me when I have so little self control. I feel a little bit better today, but was supposed to work…had to call in sick. I got some apps to try and block out that side of the internet, but it’s really hard to find good solutions. If it wasn’t for the practical necessities of the internet like getting bi
lls paid, applying for work and stuff like that I would choose not to have it. It’s like society is telling me that if I don’t have the willpower to stay away from it, even though they put it in my own home, I don’t deserve to live, not mentally or spiritual anyways. Find your willpower or die seems to be the underlying message. I’m almost thinking it’s a choice between life or the internet at this point. But it would be a real hazzle to get necessary things done without internet at home. There is a mental club in town that have computers, but right now they don’t accept new members because of corona. I guess it could be a option later though. Anybody else have thoughts on this?"

176145449,"I’m sorry you’ve been feeling this way _AT_MENTION_ . I have had similar experiences. I work as a nurse, so all my working time is spent offering advice, providing empathy, supporting those in times of crisis…however, when I’M the one in crisis, it seems as though the majority of people can’t be bothered to offer the same considerations back to me. I also feel like a bit of an outcast on this forum. I think, for the moment anyway, you need to give yourself some empathy. Hold off on dealing with other people for a while until you can get yourself straightened up. If you need, go to the hospital or seek emotional support from a hotline or one of your treating team if possible. Hold on, things can get better, it can just be so difficult to see that when you’re feeling down and out. Continue talking to us here. We’ll listen. Good luck, and hope you feel better soon."

174379318,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Are Patients With Schizophrenia Better Off With Lifetime Antipsychotic Medication?: Replication of a Naturalistic, Long-Term, Follow-Up Study of Antipsychotic Treatment. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of clinical psychopharmacology, Mar/Apr 2020 The question of whether people with schizophrenia should be treated with antipsychotics for life has been debated for decades. We recently reported results of 2 retrospective long-term naturalistic studies examining the association of medication adherence and global outcomes in different demographic samples. In both, we found that patients with a history of better adherence to antipsychotic medication had better quality of life outcomes. Using similar methodology, here we present such associations for a very different sample-patients with chronic schizophrenia with a long past history of antipsychotic treatment that had been treated for 19 to 53 years in a Veterans Affairs clinic.This is a retrospecti
ve, naturalistic, longitudinal 19- to 53-year (mean average, 33.5 years) lifetime follow-up of a consecutive series of patients with schizophrenia, who had at least 8 years of antipsychotic treatment. Lifetime data were collected on (1) their medication adherence, (2) long-term global outcome, and (3) life satisfaction. Outcomes were rated by 2 different clinicians, one with information on medication adherence (nonblind rater) and one without (blind rater). Linear regression models, adjusted for age, family support, substance use disorder, race, marital status, and number of years in treatment were used to estimate the association between adherence and each outcome.A total of 20 patients were assessed. Medication adherence was positively associated with the blind clinician's rating of global outcome (P = 0.049) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (P = 0.021). In the nonblinded clinician's rating, medication adherence was positively related to global outcome (P = 0.001) and to the patient's report of life 
satisfaction (P = 0.028).This replication study, together with our previous 2 studies, is consistent with the recommendation for continuous, long-term treatment for chronic schizophrenia over many years of a patient's lifetime unless medically contraindicated."
