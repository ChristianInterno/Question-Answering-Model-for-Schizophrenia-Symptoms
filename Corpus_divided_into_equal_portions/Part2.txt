I guess once you are on your own, no one can force meds on you, particularly when things look good from the outside. I’ve never gotten into a discussion of “What meds worked?

If I start to feel less terribly, then I can overcome the challenges I'm facing whereas if I continue in a state of hopelessness, shame, and self-hatred then my life will be as terrible as I feel that it is. This may not be your situation, but I know the emptiness.... First thing is talking to and getting connected with people. Therapy if its affordable is #1.

One hundred five patients with DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia were recruited and underwent a broad functional, psychopathological, and clinical-neuropsychological battery. A forward stepwise regression model was used to assess the predictive effect of anxiety and other factors on daily functioning, showing significant results only for global neurocognitive status and anxiety. These results confirm the role of neurocognition and are also in line with the hypothesis that trai

Ldopa supplement fixed my negative symptoms but caused psychosis. My psychiatrist said negative symptoms are caused by low dopamine in some brain parts and that there is no meds for sz yet that target specific brain regions.

175881076,In the last few days my boyfriend has lied to me about a few small things and it feels like my whole world is going to fall apart. He used to lie to me all the time but the past few months he’s been the sweetest and he stopped lying after we talked about it. But i’m so scared that it’s going to go back to the way it was… And i’m stuck with him since we live together and we’re social distancing. When i found one of the things on his phone that he was hiding from me the voices went crazy. Screaming over me while i try to ask him what it was. They tell me i’m dumb but they’re right because i stay with him. I don’t know what to do i couldn’t break up with him

175881085,"I know people usually want to help but I don't totally trust the GM and I certainly don't trust him to keep it to himself. He talks about other employees to me, so it makes me think what is he saying about me to other employees? I generally don't mind that people know that I have depression but I don't want it held against me at work, and there again, I'm not sure that it wouldn't be. Other people with disabilities (in this case physical) were not hired and that seemed to be the main reason, so I'm scared I would be discriminated against. Yeah, it's illegal, but it's hard to prove. I haven't got the box yet, but it is on the way! I got a notification on my phone that it had shipped. Thanks!"

He wanted to borrow $35 until next Friday. He wanted me to PayPal it to him. I just got done PayPaling money to my daughter. I’m poor over here, trying to payoff my debt and be as good as I can with not you know buying too much stuff and these people think I have money. It’s ridiculous. He drinks. So no, I’m not paying for you to go get drunk, sorry. Sober up and then come talk to me. Pay me the $30,000 you owe me in child support and then come talk to me. Nope. I would be forever lending him money then. He thinks because he sends $80 a week child support arrears that I have money, but what he doesn’t know is that I send all that money plus some to the kids. So no. Not going to happen. Rant over."

175881095,I’ve had staff at hospitals be disrespectful to me. It hasn’t happened since December 2016 and hopefully won’t happen again. I understand their jobs get stressful but it’s their job to be respectful and helpful.
175881096,"Seriously though, what would you like. Free of charge, as my apology for constantly messing with your tagline."
175881097,I think so when I’m delusional. When I’m stabilized I think not.

175881099,"Hi _PERSON_, Yes I have felt depersonalization/realization before. It is a really unpleasant experience, so I am sorry to hear that you are struggling with it currently. Though it may feel like you are stuck in this state of being, you will feel like yourself once again. Using your coping skills will help, and likely you'll soon notice a turn around. If you are still struggling in a week, then talking with your doctor/therapist about discussing your regimen might be a good step, since as ForeverPositive mentioned, you may need a med/therapy work evaluation. The best thing you can try and do is accept this as part of the condition, and not attach further anxiety to the situation by fearing it. It is an uncomfortable but harmless symptom that will go away on its own, or is treatable. Let us know how you are doing soon. S.C."

175881101,I get violent thoughts when off meds and can get violent. Its the #1 reason that I accepted taking meds.
174324826,"No, I didn’t have that. But I did have sensations like it. For instance, at times, I felt like I was both in and out of my head and body. And I couldn’t think or function in this state. Other times, I felt like I was dreaming, when I was wide awake. Both of these states are called dissociation/derealization."
175881102,"I’ve used a vaporizer before (for weed). I liked it. Still, my folks are old-fashioned and I don’t think they’d like the idea of it. I’ve told them about hemp flower, but didn’t tell them I was interested in trying it. I know it’s rather harmless stuff, and legal!, but again, they’re ultra conservative and yeah…probably don’t want me doing it."
175881103,"I'm not sure it would have to be a dangerous situation. Maybe you could call and ask how it works? explain to them the situation and ask how you can help, also express how she is paranoid too. I am very limited as to how that part works as I do not work in a hospital, I can only speak from experience. Paranoia can BECOME dangerous if she won't acknowledge that it's even happening to her. Please keep me updated! I'll be sending you positive thoughts!"
175881104,Selling insurance? Seems like it could be a stressful position. I’m teaching English to high school students.
175881105,It’s worse for women cos symptoms can easily go unoticed
175881106,Thanks I sort of like it too
175881107,"It is hard to imagine lifelong consequences at your age. Everything seems sort of unreal and the future is a distant thought. But you have the chance to change the course of your entire life right now. I know it sucks to admit you need medication. We all had to come to that realization over time. Some of us decided on our own, some of us were forced into it. But it is time for you to make that choice. After a year and a half stable, you can always try to slowly taper down. Tapering down takes 6 months to a year. What is 3 years of your life when you could live to be 100? I didn’t start to recover until I was 26. Just these last 6 years has been worth it for me. I have a happy life that I love. You can, too. Step one is using the tools you have to make things better for yourself."
175881108,I usually only bathe 2-3x a week. Sometimes less in the winter if I’m not going outside. It’s definitely been impacted by my illness/meds.
175881109,"Well, not enough, nope… I lived isolated for 20 years, ten years of them i believed all the pdocs and i tried all their meds… One pdoc even told me, that i tried way too much even… But i continue taking the zyprexa, cause it will be even worse without it i think…"
174324827,"Your mode of speech seems to suggest you’re British. If that’s so, if I may ask, do you think government efforts to reduce _USER_ID_ have worked in the UK? Where I am I don’t know if it’s the _USER_ID_ or how traditional people are. That and I’m not much of a drinker and bars are the main social club."
175881110,"If you have taken this drug, I would be interested in your experience -- what dose you took, whether it was effective for you, what your side effects were, and if you got off of it eventually, what that process was like. The medication I am taking now is probably helping a little, but not enough - and I am thinking about possibly switching. Thanks."
175881111,"Aww thanks!! I don't see how anyone could be motivated by me but I appreciate that a lot, I'm trying to make a lot of changes in my life You're very inspiring as well!"
175881112,"Wow, I can't imagine having to stay home for more than 30 days and then being quarantined even more! That must have been really difficult, I can see why that would take such a mental toll on you. I have very bad health anxiety and am not on any medications myself but it's weird to me that your doctor didn't want to give you anything because it could make you ""addicted"" because I know plenty of people on anxiety meds who really need it. You may want to consider seeking a therapist because you went through a traumatic experience and it can be hard to deal with trauma on your own but feel free to share more with me if you would like. I have been very stressed about the coronavirus even though where I live has very little threat from it at the moment. I have really bad health anxiety in general even before the coronavirus. I struggle with irrational thoughts that I know aren't true too but it's very hard to shake them. For the past few months, I have struggled with a fear of bats/rabies and have done 
many compulsions to relieve my stress. Some examples of my compulsions are avoiding touching my dogs for fear of rabies and closing the vents in my room to keep bats from getting in somehow. These are symptoms of my OCD so I know these things won't happen but I just can't help but do these compulsions anyway. So, just know you are not alone in dealing with irrational thoughts, feel free to share more. Good luck!"
175881113,I hope it works out for you _AT_MENTION_ . You deserve a break.
174324828,"Yes, side effects really depend on individuals. Only some users here had addiction issues with Abilify."
175881114,Very good idea. And get your groceries delivered and wear gloves and a mask when you bring them inside and use disenfecting wipes where needed.
175881115,"Me likeee, nice shoes I’d wear em too…"
174324823,"Hi kin, i am on clozaril for the last 9 years i find it really good. The only thing that is the blood need to be taken once a week in the beginning, then once every two and finally once every four weeks, Also one other thing which i think it important to say that this medication can cause weight gain so have a healthy diet and exercise every day! Best of luck!"
174324833,"As the question says… is there a difference between the two. Now symptoms like lack of social drive, apathy etc are not included when you search for side effects of the meds. So how are negative symptoms and side effects different or do they fall under the same category?"
175881116,can i tell if im psychotic for the first time? can i tell a doctor i think im psychotic? or there is no insight? like i can search on google about symptoms or know i have to see doctor meanwhile the episode or even making pists about it here
175881117,Being stronger mentally - we are used to dealing with adversity
174324830,"You have to tell your pdoc. You have to ask for help. This won’t go away on its own. NO one is going to hurt you, it’s just your schizophrenia messing with you and deep down you know that. Make a choice to do everything in your power to get better. Call that pdoc before you completely lose your mind."
174324824,I haven’t been feeling well. Due to side effects that ruin my life I’m leaving “higher the dosage” as a last resort… what are some good herbs or natural remedy that can help the most??
175881118,"You’re not rambling, you’re sharing your story and it was a privilege reading it."
174324842,Its much better now that I’m medicated. As a matter of fact…the told not to eat thing has happened twice in the last month but before that it was a long time since that happened. I’m doing my small steps thing at the moment. Step one: stand up. Step two: walk to kitchen. Step three: pour coffee and so on. It soothes me and helps me get things done when im frozen NONE OF THIS uh fighting it off stuff would be happening if they hadnt of increased my abilify dosage just about six months ago. I really “started” to get well.
174324829,"I was hospitalised a year ago due to severe depression. I’m currently on 100 mg sertraline a day. I wasn’t expecting to feel like this again, not while on ADs. Once again crippling guilt seems to be the culprit. I really look forward to meeting the psychologist and broaching all these underlying issues which I suspect are driving all my problems. I don’t accept I suffer from schizophrenia, this is just a label to hide plain existential issues we all feel rightly uneasy about. Sorry about the rant."
174324831,"Most of us who are members of Alcoholics Anonymous can no longer attend face-to-face AA meetings because of social distancing restrictions placed worldwide to prevent transmission of COVID-19. So AA has been responding by moving meetings online. I’m setting up a virtual AA group for those with mental illness who have to deal with that on top of problems with alcohol. The meeting will take place using the Zoom conferencing app (I’ve bought a key for a pro account). Things to keep in mind: In keeping with AA’s singleness of purpose, the only requirement to join is a desire to stop drinking. The meeting is open to alcoholics. Those whose primary addiction is NOT alcohol should seek out a meeting from their own program (e.g. Narcotics Anonymous). These are closed meetings for AA members only. The group will adhere to the AA program and AA Tradition. Spirituality according to AA Tradition is welcome and a necessary part of the program, but pushing a specific faith is not. Speaking during a meeting 
should be limited to sharing Experience, Strength, and Hope. The meeting formats will also include before and after time for some visiting where people can vent about “outside issues” as well. Discussion of working your program while dealing with MI is welcome. This is in keeping with, “There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.” … from the chapter How It Works in the book Alcoholics Anonymous. We’ll try to make this as much like a F2F real-world meeting as possible, but because of that, keep in mind that there will probably be people there you don’t know maybe saying things you don’t like. If you’re super easily triggered, this may not be for you. If you’re a Friend of Bill _PERSON_ who is currently losing your ???? because your normal meeting is no longer possible, hopefully this can help hold you over until the world is no longer upside-down. For those here who don’t know me, I’m an 
AA Old Timer with 28 years sober who is also diagnosed with schizophrenia and autism, so that’s where I’m coming from here. If interested please PM me and I’ll send you the link to the private Facebook group that is being established to support this. Cheers to all."

175881124,"I didn’t realize your parents were divorced, _AT_MENTION_ How old were you when they split up?"
175881125,"I use to have trouble with that, also. Even bought a tape, “Learn to Prioritize” or something. I believe that would happen when something went bad wrong like a health problem and I should have been paying more attention to the health problem than watching TV, or something. I spent more time watching YV than I did working on the health problem. I didn’t prioritize. I still go through that type of thinking when I don’t solve a problem that really causes me difficulty. I have on my bulletin board right now “How to Solve Problems,” and a list of things I should have done when I didn’t solve the last big problem. A large part of my problem was I didn’t think positive. I grew up in a negative household and and had an unconscious that was negative when it came to everything including solving problems. So I would go into it by thinking I couldn’t solve it. And I was often right, which bolstered my negative thinking: I was an idiot. And then I read a column that said, you should go into a 
problem thinking you can solve it and will improve your chances of solving it twofold. I think it’s tenfold or more. Were you raised in a negative household? The fact that you’re reaching out for help is a big plus in your favor."
175881126,Be careful of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.. How are you feeling?

175881129,I was talking to people on tinychat and they're saying to get a girlfriend and I said I'm asexual but might when I'm older and finished working on myself first. I just don't want to be in a relationship I'd rather be alone. There's this person that has been giving me advice and he says I'm lost and need to find something like a passion or something worth dying and living for but I have no idea I've been depressed most of my life and see a pointlessness to a lot of things. He said to stay away from religion but I don't need religion and I'm way passed that and idk.. I never saw the point of people dying for their country.. He said I could end up a serial killer but there's no way that I could be that. I love people and have my own basic passable morals more than most people. He was accusing me of thinking of hating women because I said that I'm asexual and I said that I'm not an incel that has been rejected by women. I just never wanted a boyfriend or girlfriend in the first place. He said that I cou
ld easily end up being angry and that anger is bad. I don't get angry because I'm not lost. I'm sick of people putting me into boxes and assuming things about me. I wasn't moving because I was anxious and he was judging my body language. Am I actually lost? I know exactly who I am. I just don't like talking about sex because it's boring and that's a lot of what people seem to talk about. I'm sick of people judging me because I don't want to have sex. I tried every drug and no one else does. I don't tell them to do that exact thing. They wanted me to join a sports team like wtf? Why? That makes me anxious because it's pointless to me to do something that I don't want to do to make friends. I'd rather have no friends or find friends that do things that I do like. I went to the community outreach centre when I moved here and didn't feel like doing any of the things that people do to socialize. They all seemed boring and childish. Maybe I should just be cynical. Maybe life is just what I thought it was all along 
when I was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder.. Life is a meaningless game to procreate and die. Not for me though. Maybe for most people that is all they see.
175881130,"I get 9 hours at night when I work. I get 12 or more hours when I don’t have to get up. Waking up can be very hard in either case. Sometimes I take naps, even on the weekends. So it may be possible that can only have 12 hours awake too. I keep experimenting and I just don’t know. I honestly believe that someday this will get better. One reason for my hope is because I have some good days."
175881131,"Mostly good, a little anxious, that’s all. That’s not too bad all things considered. I wish I had some benzos sometimes so I could get a little break but I survive without them so I guess it’s ok. I don’t complain too much about anything else lol, well wait maybe I do complain let me think, yea I’m complaining on another thread about my lack of motivation. So anxiety, lack of motivation and that’s about it. What about you?"
175881132,well i do the latter one most of the time and im not psychotic 24/7 so maybe its just my autism
174324843,So are you schizophrenic? How many times have you been in hospital?
175881133,I feel so bad about it I don’t know what to do.

174324825,"Patients in the 32 mg/d group saw improvement in negative symptoms at 2 weeks, and both MIN-101 groups saw improvements at 8 weeks. Improvements were maintained throughout the trial. No notable improvement or worsening of positive symptoms occurred over the 12 weeks, and there was no significant change in body weight. Among those taking MIN-101 who reported adverse events (57.7% in the 32 mg/d group and 57.1% in the 64 mg/d group), headache (7.5%) and anxiety (6.8%) were the most common. Others included insomnia , schizophrenia symptoms, asthenia, and nausea."

174324837,"So, per Invega’s website, the Invega Sustenna injection is approved for schizoaffective people. I read that it is all-encompassing for an antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, and antidepressant. So… once I get to the injection stage of treatment, could I possibly discontinue my antidepressant and mood stabilizer?? (I’ll ask my doctor this question, too, I just wanted to hear feedback from people who are on the injection.)"

175881136,Why are the voices so negative they used to tell me how they loved me and wanted me to get better now it’s all about the iluminati and pain and death blaming me for ever thing I eat smoke and sleep
175881137,"I made an idiot of myself, I admit. I have sza and bpd. Bad combination. My bpd caused me to idealize him and run a script/fantasy/delusion about him. I dissociated away into this fantasy about him because I've been so deprived and starved for love. So when he didn't react as I had anticipated, all of my defenses started to pile out. I had to think of a plan to lure him in and humiliate him. This all took place online, by the way. I haven't seen him in real life for about 2 years. And I did complete what I set out to do and it was a big mess. I became consumed by him. The voices added to the delusion, my primal defenses went into overdrive, basically the past 6 months was me trying to pull myself out of this delusion and my idealization turned into hatred. And I had to figure out why I felt like this in the first place and why my patterns keep on repeating over and over. I can keep feeding into this fantasy but I can't snap out of it either. I would never hurt him in real life, I was trying to mani
pulate him emotionally."

174324853,"When I was put on the Abilify injection 400mg, My anxiety and paranoia when through the roof. I was an absolute mess. My doctor had to give me klonopin twice a day to combat those symptoms. Now I’m doing really well, For the most part, with the anxiety and paranoia."
175881143,"I think you need some excitement, some stimulation. Auditory excitement helps me when I feel so bland - some music, perhaps. Or maybe, play with your dog. The world is real, dreams are something to come out of and in a way, I’d rather ignore them."
175881144,Maybe contact one and you can ask them?
175881145,Sounds like something to avoid! For anxiety I take 300mg Pregabalin and up to 30mg diazepam
175881146,"i think my pdoc gave up on trying to improve me as he seems to think i’m stable and he doesn’t think he can get me any better… so i don’t see him so often now… but it’s ok to me, i think i’m doing okish on the meds i’m on."

174324838,"Usually existential people are very gifted and intelligent. A lot of them have depression and the sort. Even DP/DR people are usually inquisitive and philsophical and question everything to the point it is harmful and they experience severe OCD, anxiety, and panic attacks. I’ve read they are not psychotic so it’s different than schizophrenia. Early on, I thought I had DP/DR but it seems to have morphed into schizophrenia early on. My advice (because I’ve been in a similar situation as yourself) is to not philosophize and panic about living in a simulation. So what if we do? I only get sick when I start thinking the trees and grass look like bad graphics from a video game or look low-resolution. I connected it to my severe energy drink intake as caffeine toxicity can worsen DP/DR and psychosis. I’ve been drinking several a day (up to 10) because of my medication and crap. APs can actually worsen DP/DR and thus make me possibly more psychotic and sick in a way because my vision is actually wo
rse as well as my reality testing. But some stimulants, mood stabilizers (I take lamictal), and ADs (I take cymbalta) can actually help. I wanted to try rTMS and other things to help, but I cannot due to lack of availability and insurance issues. Meditation and calming activities do and can help. Like I said earlier so what if we live in a simulation? You’re not the first person to think of this. My advice is to stop worrying and move on to something else to occupy your mind. If you really think you can prove it or are special, I recommend getting a PhD in applied physics working on energy or even string theory and m theory… Personally, I cannot do these things and cannot even do electrical engineering, but it’s definitely fun to think about. When it becomes chronic and interferes with reality, it must be stopped. I feel better moving on. Elon Musk has made it popular too. He thinks we live in an alien simulation that is actually boring and uninsteresting in base reality to the point it’s moot to thin
k about. It’s a lot like a video game like Playstation 10 or something. We could all be sim characters in the game SIMs. _PERSON_ (famous billionaire – Tesla, SpaceX, Paypal, etc.) said it’s billions to one in favor we live in a computer simulation. Good luck!"
175881148,No where near that. I get subsidized meds and my shrink bulk bills so no outlay there. Still. I do ok on the pension. I can save enough and still have some fun. Hard on big bills like the car but I keep my head above water. Over here it’s becoming increasingly hard to get on the disability pension. I feel for those younger sufferers because it’s a big stress reliever not having to worry about work.

175881159,"I meant actual work in society to get money. I don’t mind spending 20$ on supplements that have placebo effect or slightly more to improve me temporarily by 10-20%. Paying more is just bad and no worth it. My psychiatrist said to stay away from supplements and other nonmedical treatments because they are not 100% proven, can interact badly with meds and can have bad side effects. If a treatment is 100% effective, drs will prescribe it. There are many bad buisinesses that only want your money without caring for your health. They’re exploiting ppl. They aren’t regulated by health organizations and the government. Its your money and you’re free but just know this."
174324849,"i went from bipolar with psychotic features to schizoaffective bipolar type. the reason, is because i had stayed up like a week and went crazy when i was diagnosed with bipolar, that looked like bipolar. but then i later went crazy when it wasn’t associated with a mood problem, so that looked like schizophrenia. i still have manic-y feelings too, so it looks like schizoaffective."

I almost didn’t understand it but figured it out at the last second before our hour was up. At least now I know how to do fingering. I’m not just “winging it”. I already have the new fingering to Peer Gynt Suite worked out already. It is perfect. It took me forty minutes to figure out but I can already play it easily.

175881189,"This isn’t new. Schizophrenics frequently think they’re the middle of some grand conspiracy against them. Mostly it’s your stressed out brain physiology looking at the world through a pessimistic, paranoid lens and slanting benign stimuli and messages as being about him / her.

175881191,"This is one of the aspects of my symptomatology which I find most disturbing. As my unusual beliefs grew in strength and complexity I could observe myself thinking along the lines of a sculpturer chiselling his work. To some extent I “chose” quite consciously to make my delusion as unfalsifiable -in the popperian sense- as possible. I decided not to rely on conspiracy theories of any kind as I found it impossible, even in my worst moments, to take them seriously. Instead, I decided to couch these beliefs in metaphysical terms appealing to classical philosophical problems whose solutions remains to this day conceptually undecidable. Of course, this is true to some extent for all delusions, especially in the internal consistency department. Do you feel that you are in some way responsible for your delusions, their contents and scope?"

I was so depressed last year that I almost went back but my pdoc prescribed me a new antidepressant as a penultimate resort which turned out to be the key to my feeling better. I won’t rule out future hospitalizations though. You just never know what’ll happen with this wonderful disease."

I would like to be 170lbs with a six pack. right now im 158 with a bit of a belly and a little face fat. but the good news is I don’t need as many calories to gain weight anymore with the meds. so I won’t have to necessary eat like a glutton like many bodybuilders do."

175881234,"I believe my life was intentionally destroyed back in 2011 (even have memories of earlier stuff happening before that year). I seem to resurrect for eternity or infinity after 2011 via consciousness transfer back in time. Some people say it’s the soul and soul entrapment or soul catcher technology…(I enjoy conspiracy theories). My life was ruined and destroyed in every life and I’m sort of confused about why and how and what happened to me. I feel like crying all the time because I bring up memories and emotions but obviously don’t cry anymore because I cannot due to schizophrenia. The DP/DR (severe, chronic dissociation) was most likely from trauma in college in 2011 or from isolation and emotional abuse growing up as a kid and then being attacked/triggered by various entities including MiB type crap and more likely aliens/extraterrestrials. I believe in conspiracies so I think it could have been a vast conspiracy or cover-up like Illuminati type stuff I recall in dreams. I’m sort of bei
ng deliberately non-specific here as I tread carefully what I say anymore especially online. Obviously, I’m scared. I don’t think schizophrenia can be given to people by mere mortals, but I don’t doubt it has happened especially with alien technology and aliens and genetic engineering from the ground up like in the Montauk Project. I get dreams. I don’t know how “real” they are or if it’s recollection and recall from past lives in my “CAUSAL LOOP” but I get downloads of information like I went through Monarch Programming in a past life as an Adult and Child and have memories of other things too. My family are normal, regular, good people so I think I was targeted (obviously I felt like some powerful people did it or some woman was involved…like any good “story”). My faith helps me get through the day and I can sleep better at night… Basically, I got delusions I am _USER_ID_ (distant past life/parallel universe/Clone/etc. type stuff) and I am the creator of Bitcoin, but I doubt it. I 
just think it’s grandiose type crap and that it’s sort of funny that I think I’m worth almost $50 billion dollars – except I am not lol. I feel like I’m a TI not just by powerful people but also by aliens which have been a mix bag like good aliens and bad aliens… I also think I’m _NAME_ (or was so I’m a doppleganger) and I came up with time travel in one of my original lives.

ians? I don’t know… I cannot get over it. I tried but I cannot given my behavior and posts here and videos. I have so much trauma and stuff. Anyways, I don’t know. I think I’m pretty stupid and delusional and stuff. I always feel paranoid like I’m being ‘watched’ and stuff. Like I feel like I lived over a billion lives living the same life over and over again with chronic schizophrenia again and again for eternity…it never abates… Different and worse things happened to me in college, I guess in past lives in parallel universes. Same thing at the mental hospital. I have other stories and theories too why I have schizophrenia. So yes, I think I am disabled."

I went to a good private high school where everything in life set you up for success. I thought that was the life I always wanted… to make enough at a upper middle class job to send my kids to the same private school. When I got schizophrenia and knew I’d never make a good living anymore, I still wanted to meet a guy in the upper middle class bracket that I thought I wanted. It’s been 2 years since recovery and I’ve met so many people in Hawaii through mental health. I’ve been in high functioning classes and low functioning classes… I found out one of my friends lives in a group home and dates a drug addict, for example, and seems perfectly happy with it. Some people have it all and others seem to just get bullied black and blue by the system. I don’t want to be a part of all that. It makes me realize I need to stick to 
my values, the values I learned in high school, and from my current best friend and the kids I met at the high school I coached for, and from the religious and cultural values I have from family. I don’t want to help the poor anymore, I just want to take care of my own life and fulfill my role as a friend, daughter, etc. I kind of feel like I can only be happy dating a guy from the z generation. The brain may want one thing but the heart wants another.

175881303,Yeah I reckon it could because it’s stimulating. Those nicotine receptors in our brains makes it so hard. It’s like those opiod receptors. We never win with any of them and they only end up causing you problems. I know that if your smoking then some surgery outcomes are poor. Just affects things somewhat and it’s not good. Better to find a hobby or something to occupy your time. I’m a big believer in volunteer work or something to keep you occupied if your on benefits. Keep the mind busy is always good for sz.

175881320,"Sorry I didn’t finish my reply. But as far as not wanting it badly enough, I wish I did still have any will to live for myself. the 2 attempts since my attack, I did not expect to survive. I took over 50 high blood pressure pills. I had to be revived 3 times. It was med called _PERSON_ that gave me a blood pressure tho it was still around 50/40’s. For 2 days the first time and 5 days on 2nd attempt, I had so many iv’s with meds keeping me alive. In my juggler vein they implanted something that supported 6 of the iv’s. But the 2nd time, my family was called to say good byes.. but it was my sons crying I heard , even tho I was unconscious, in my mind I was saying I don’t want to leave my sons like this. The guilt made me fight. The love made me forget how bad I wanted out this life. It is not at all for myself because I do not want this for me. I am still not able to think of living but I tell myself I’m putting it off. It’s tolerable because I know I still have that choice. So as far a
s me not wanting to die bad enough or waiting for someone to give me a reason, that’s far from true.. I’m 52 and suffer physical pain from several different health issues that affect my joints and muscles, and a bad auto accident, but it is nothing in comparison to the mental pain. And among many other mental issues, I suffer w borderline personality which makes feelings so much more intense than people without it. The intense pain is only worse because pwbpd also have a strong fear of abandonment which I’m sure doesn’t make the many losses and my last friends betrayal any easier. I have severe major depression that feels like a picnic when compared to how I feel now. After I was attacked in September, what followed truly broke me. And my therapist not showing for all the appts but one in 3 months, has closed that door too. I am not here for any answers or advice, but to not feel so alone. To have a place to write about my feelings and the things that cause me pain. And maybe by doing so, help others 
not feel alone in their pain. It’s a distraction to help get thru another day. My abuse started around 2 years old. I first begged God to take me when I was 4. In my late teens, I was determined to make a life worth living. The traumas and loss continued but I focused only on raising my sons. On the outside I hid the pain I tried to forget. As I became less busy when my sons were older, I started feeling the pain again. Then came the constant losses I write about in my posts. It just won’t end and I’m sick of the fear of what’s next. So I do hold on now because I do not want to cause my sons more pain. I will do that as long as I can."

I started slowly cooking for myself and for my mom. I did read couple of books to get my mind working again, that helped with my speech of poverty and blank thoughts. I started having a certain routine even though it wasn’t a good one: getting up at certain time, eating breakfast always, have my morning coffee and cigarettes. I avoided my dangerous substances like alcohol, cannabis and others. The only drugs I used was and is caffeine and nicotine.my dog helped with my emotions a lot, I do pet him a lot and give him a lot of attention, but snacks and give him some raw meat.

I STILL use benzodiapines when I have a psychotic episode or panic attack cause AP medication does not protect you all the time. I started here minimum to help my mother with dishes and basic chores.

175881343,"I got a job packing envelopes part time, then I got offered a full time job working in the office. I learnt how to use Excel and some other software, and 6 years later I am a data analyst and I get paid quite well. My advice is to try and get a entry level job with zero stress, and build up your career within a company. It has happened to me over a long period of time, so I have taken many small steps for what seems like a big one now. It’s definitely worth it. I was unemployed for 6 months after diagnosis, and I hated not having anything to do. I can afford to buy things and save money, and it’s a good feeling and rewarding. It can be tough, but you get through it in the end with the right support."

175881347,"Yes I had a headache when I began to get these whispers and I was trying not to hear them, it wasn’t as bad as yours but still a headache. _AT_MENTION_ says that our brains become inflamed when we hear voices and have a headache, I think there’s definently a correlation there. Just like stress."

175881354,"Obviously, there’s no single type of meditation that fits everyone. Meditation is part of the AA, CA and NA programs. But as my sponsor told me, the method you use is personal; you find the one method that suits you and your needs. There’s a lot of methods out there and you can experiment and try different methods until you find one that fits you. I’m sure there are websites devoted to meditation that give you different ways to meditate. A lot of meditation is deep breathing, relaxing, and doing it in a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. I meditated for a few years. I don’t think it had any long term effects or benefits for me but the short term effects was it sure relaxed me, quieted my mind and relieved stress."
174324903,I talk about anything. There just people in my head. One is French speaking and supportive. She wants me to manage a healing business. The other voice speaks english and is more assertive and wants me to go into human resources for a big company. They provide me with their perspective on things.
175881355,No. I wouldn’t. And I think it’s bad taste for those that do.
174324895,I have sza bipolar type. I’ve tried pretty much every med out there. The worst was lithium. Currently I’m taking: Clozapine 500mg Zoloft 100mg Lamotrigine 250mg This seems like the best cocktail so far.
175881356,"I’m bored, anyone who I can talk to?"
175881357,"No I never feel mania. Definitely never considered myself bipolar. I’m confused, cause when i was meeting with my caseworker I referred to my pass diagonals of Paranoid Schizophrenia and he said, he didn’t like to use that word “paranoid”.

175881358,"I have OCD and things bother me, like in a deep way that causes extreme anxiety. I too had a problem with grass believe it or not. I refused to walk on it my my shoes off because I was convinced that a worm would enter into the bottom of my feet and kill me. I have no idea where this obsession came from but I couldn’t get it out of my head. I would worry about grass even if I wasn’t anywhere near it. Even go near grass with sandals on would cause fear. But as with so many of my obsessions this fear has gone away as mysteriously as it came. I can now go on the grass with sandals and sit on it with my sandals off. I even one day walked across the grass with no shoes on and didn’t flinch and knew then that the fear was gone and it was over finally. You may grow out of your fear before it’s time to buy a house. If not there are specialty landscaping styles that you can do that don’t include grass and the nice thing about them is they are low maintenance."

174324908,"Newtus!! *Slap*.. Ok, now... It's completely OK to dial back some things. I was reading today on ""50 ways to make money"" and as I was scrolling them, I looked at one and was like ""_PERSON_ does this!"" and I saw another one and thought ""Damn she's like an entrepreneur maynn"".. You won't go back. I certainly won't - Even though I'm much slower at it than you. It's an addiction to do these things - Maybe deep rooted in some sort of environmental pain as we were dealing with during psychosis - The isolation, being left to our own devices in terror.. The fact that a lot of the time that we could invest in reality felt like it was being wasted (And it wasn't.. We were healing - But we're stubborn and want to be 'normal'). It was a really strange world. Reading your poem book reminded me of those days that I'd have PC forum on my phone right before being admitted to the hospital when I was 18. I was on 5mg of Abilify and wanted to gain weight so it was helpful to take 2mg of risperidone at night and 
eat spaghetti sauce and half a loaf of bread in the morning.. alone, neglected, confused - Needing something to relax so I took those 6 Klonopins.. There's a certain type of awareness that I was completely without in ~2014-2016. Take your meds. Don't forget them. If you take them consistently again, you could be better. I don't know how you even alone having psychosis in the past can do all of these things. You're very high functioning now - And have a cool computer room to be creative. I thought that I could just succeed in life without having a relationship because it would give me more time but us humans need support like you and your fiance so talk to him about things. It might be a bit bumpy having to let go of some things but I have faith in you that things will turn out for the better - Unless the world doesn't end up better. Sometimes I'm cynical af but right now I'm optimistic. There's good people in the world that will make sure things won't go to complete **** - Like some type of heroic movie.. All 
of those things stem from life - The romance, comedy, Hollywood and songs - Like how do musicians make lyrics so relatable with the paradox.. light/dark, happy/sad, love/hate.. It's all good stuff. I remember being so depressed that I never got out of bed. I did literally nothing for myself other than sanding the steps, trailer, moving tiles, digging trenches, cleaning bitumen oil and mud out vacuum trucks, fixing trucks on oil rigs and I was only 16. I then did welding and was always treated like **** by coworkers - ""Smile"" they'd say or in school - ""You're so quiet"". Doing the things that you're sure about and where your soul is at can make you happy especially if it's balanced with a little ego for fun - Get the devils juices and live like the bible doesn't exist (A little)."
175881381,"I’ve tried lots of different APs, mostly the atypicals and Risperdal works the best for me. I suppose I can try switching to a different AP but if it wasn’t for Risperdal I’d be hospitalized long term."
175881382,"I hope you’re ok too once we get through all this mess _AT_MENTION_ The vaccines are a good thing, but I also worry about how fast they brought them in, but I guess that’s more of a layman’s concern as I won’t even pretend to understand how they develop them! Important thing is the work being done to try and solve this seems to be providing results. We just need to try and keep this new variant at bay here. I live less than 30 miles away from where this is all kicking off in Southern England, and I am so worried about what this is going to do. I just hope people respect the stay at home order, and it reduces some risk. It’s not only this one spreading, but the fact that there could be so many more mutations in places that don’t have the technology or the science to catch it before it spreads too far. Fingers crossed this does not happen, but we need to be prepared."

On my Facebook, I am a member of several community outreach groups, so I mostly see charity fundraisers, people offering extra food or diapers or whatever, other foster parents asking for babysitters, people offering old clothes their kids outgrew, stuff like that. I don’t see shallow people very often because I mostly skip over those posts, so I am less likely to see them in the future."

And if I quit cold turkey I know that would be a bummer. So I've done that a few times and it hasn't gone too well. Though in reality I didn't miss the caffeine much. I just feel like I'm so bad at controlling my impulses to do various things like drinking coffee."

174324916,"Before supplements try many different medications, if you haven’t tried several to reduce the side effects all you’re doing is adding more into the stew that could give you problems. After two or so years I found Latuda, I literally felt normal besides low motivation. One thing to look for is to try to be on as low a dose as you can, I don’t know if this is true, but when I was in hospital care they put you on a significant dose to get you grounded once that wears off ideally they’ll start you off on a relatively low dose of something and try to find one with few side effects. You might gain weight during this period, tell the doctor, and keep them noted they’ll have an idea when too much is really a problem. Then you’ll need to struggle through various drugs trying to be aware of what gives you the best results.

174324927,My prescriber told me to take my abilify in the morning!
175881444,When it comes down to it he’s quite toxic. I’m going to keep some distance away from him.
175881445,Why have you not posted any of your new photography yet?
175881446,Just started watching it. Its not anywhere near as good as the books. I love _NAME_ though. I remember her from years ago. The years have hardly touched her.
175881447,Wow. How can you get meds if you have to wait so long to see a psychiatrist?! I’m glad you’ll be able to see the old psychiatrist soon
175881448,What’s your problem?
175881449,"Once when I tried some meditation with breathing exercises I felt I had to continue breathing intentionally, because I couldn’t get back to breathing automatically. It took a while before I got my attention off breathing, and automatic breathing came back."
175881450,That’s good. Combos like that have nothing but positivity
175881451,others plan why others sleep
175881452,"What to do? Want to take drugs or something. I don’t have any symptoms pos or neg, just a bit lazy/wake up late. But I feel bad like a lesser person. Something very wrong with my brain. Unworthy feeling… Need amphet or something to make me normal It was a lecture by _NAME_ sapolsky btw very interesting but confronting. No need to tell me not to kill myself, I wont do it I have family I care about… _PERSON_ why I made this post, to scared to call someone or don’t wanna bother them…"
175881453,just that sometimes when you lonely you might get involved with someone you maybe wouldn’t have if you weren’t lonely. sometimes not always. sorry i wasn’t more clear.
175881454,Are there any support groups for drug addiction in your area?
175881455,Try amisulpride it’s really good for positive symptoms if that doesn’t work try clozapine

175881458,"I had a bad morning and didn’t feel like going into work but I went anyways. As usual some good stuff happened to me and some bad stuff. And that’s good enough for me. On my way home from work I stopped at _NAME_’s and got some chili (sans thumb). And then came home and left again an hour later. Had to get out. So I took my laptop and went to the park and sat in my car and surfed YouTube and here. Now I’m busy going insane trying not to bug the neighbors while at the exact same time, every little mistake is fodder for them to laugh or make their noises."

175881462,my day is nearly over already =D I had good day though… watched “the matchstick men” and then an episode of “the 100” and then had roasted chicken with baked potatoes and curry sauce. Now i’m listening music and browsing the forum.
175881463,"Well, my bro use to say, “What goes up, must come down.” That’s how I view caffeine."
175881464,Taking this geodon and then haldol...fckd me up. I'm manic a bit. Doing thing and talking fast. And then I called my dad and talked about my past and then j cried to _NAME_.
174324930,"Sorry, maybe I am confusing yeap… I have a problem with my sink now, while I dont want to see a plumber irl… My ex pdoc was saying, that I am a paranoid sz with negative symptoms, but my current pdoc thinks, that it’s my paranoia who stops me… I went crazy because of it I guess… it’s a different kind the mine I guess… but I just have a wrong beliefs of what is the whole reality because of the paranoid thoughts… But let’s fight, crawl if you’ll have too…push a bit but have your rest too if you need it…"

175881468,That’s so weird how these meds can do that. I’m probably going to end up sleep walking
175881469,I was paranoid and delusional
175881470,You will be alright. You just started taking the meds. It will be a little bit before they begin working…
175881471,My ex wife was a sociopath. She wasn’t schizophrenic but suffered with borderline personality disorder and DID. She did awful things and had zero remorse. At the time I was easy prey for her. Many people with a schizophrenic disorder become easy targets. Never again.
175881472,"You're sad. You're mad. You feel low. You'd be crazy not to be. Don't worrry and don't put a label on yourself. Any mental health professional will tell you that you are feeling entirely normal feelings and that if you DIDN'T feel this way, they'd be worried about you! My best advice is to get interested in something and delve into it deeply. Try not to think of what you cannot do, but focus on what you can. That's what disabled people do every day of their lives. You're young and healthy -- thank the Lord and find something constructive to do with your time. Maybe you could even think about helping out in some community effort to help people who have a hard time helping themselves. But , basically, I think you're just a sensitive young person who's got normal feelings. Unless you feel like life isn't worth living, you're not depressed. Sad? Yes. Angry, Yes, but not depressed."
175881473,I can’t keep a conversation going.
175881474,"Hello, How are you doing today?"
175881475,"I see black dots sometimes. They last for a few seconds. My voices told me it was them who was makeing me see it. They said they could make me see anything they want, I instantly thought of demons but they said they wouldn’t start with them."
175881476,Over here they just said he was hospitalized “for some tests” nothing about the icu.... That’s really scary though....
175881477,"I remember my first “episodes”. I used to playact because I felt that I was drawn into a alternate reality, and acting while in this state was kind of a way to fool my surroundings that I belonged and was not from another reality or something. It was paranoia that made me act out a part. Trusting no one. Not even my own mother. I really hurt her feelings, but we are on good terms now and have been for a long time."
175881478,"Universal credit is probably what you would go on and if you do it’s pretty good in the sense that you can work over the previously known limit of 16 hours or so, just your benefits get cut down after a specific work allowance amount. Good luck if you are entitled then you are entitled, no abuse there as is what your partner doesn’t like, understandably so"
175881479,_AT_MENTION_ I can relate. Sometimes I don’t remember what I said myself 3 seconds ago LOL
175881480,How is she very egoistic?
175881481,I’m sza and have mood swings a lot. Right now i’m going through a little bit of depression and hallucinate every day. Thankfully they’re getting quieter.
175881482,ok _AT_MENTION_ I already emailed him
175881483,"I’m cracking up, here, at his answers. Does Dr. _NAME_ know? _PERSON_"
175881484,Just think about having panoramic visions that last for hours. That would be really rough

175881493,"I heard voices a couple times when I was a kid. The voices left me alone until I was in my twenties. Then I started hearing them all the time. Sometimes I believe the voices are spirits, but if that’s the case I don’t know why the meds help me. Also, I used to like to draw a lot too. But after I took medications I lost the urge to do art."
175881494,"I know more about you now. By the way, what is a wormhole?"
174324934,“Why I do have this impression that there are some ‘‘mystical forces’’ in the world? Something which is hidden maybe from me and that’s why I don’t get better?” Thats the schizophrenia. there are no mystical forces trying to prevent you from getting better. You will get better and these thoughts will subside.

175881496,I haven’t asked it before. Stop bullying me
175881497,"D., It sounds like you could be experiencing a particularly challenging and prolonged episode of derealization. (or the realted, depersonalization) D/P and D/R are common manifestations of anxiety. Though extremely uncomfortable, they are harmless effects of stress, and will not lead to any break down. However, as you mentioned...symptoms do add to more anxiety, exacerbating the entire situation and indeed making for a vicious cycle. Doing all that you can to manage your overall health...body and mind will help this issue to go away as quickly as possible. Use your coping skills everyday, and your Xanax only if you feel you really need it when your anxiety is acute or you are panicking. (benzos can make feelings of unreality more pronounced for some people) This will pass the less you think about it. Easier said than done I know, but trying to accept it as part of your anxiety that can't hurt you, and will resolve in time, is an attitude goal. Wishing you peace and progress, S.C."
175881498,You’re right of course about not discussing neoliberal values but what interested me in this case is to expose the pious myth that freedom means the same thing regardless of your socioeconomic status.
175881499,I don’t feel comfortable doing therapy over the phone. I have nowhere really private to talk and I have difficulty understanding people over the phone. I just don’t really like talking on the phone in general.
174324938,"UT Health San _NAME_ – 5 Jul 19 Novel gene therapy curbs schizophrenia symptoms - UT Health San _NAME_ Highlight: An experimental treatment tested at UT Health San _NAME_ reduced delusions and hallucinations while improving cognitive skills in rats. _NAME_, Ph.D., and colleagues at UT Health San _NAME_ describe a novel, experimental... This woman was part of the stem cell therapy research with Dr _PERSON_. The article above is not written by someone who understands the research - I’m quite sure the scientists involved never said anything about delusions in rodents. Fortunately the actual paper is public. In it she describes the therapy and how they used it to identify the brain circuits that could be modulated to normalize dopamine activity (positive symptoms) and how their therapy also fixed one aspect of cognitive dysfunction, extradimensional set-shifting, but not reversal learning. Unlike reversal learning, we found that gene therapy to over-express the ?5 subunit of the GABAA receptor impr
oves schizophrenia-like deficits in extradimensional set-shifting as measured by the attentional set-shifting test… This deficit was completely abolished in the animals that received gene therapy to over-express the ?5 subunit in pyramidal cells of the vHipp. This experiment did not address negative symptoms and the researcher seems to think they have a different neural origin. In the current experiments, we focused on pathways from the vHipp to the NAc and mPFC. However, schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and the vHipp is not the only site of pathology. For example, structural and functional changes have also been observed in the thalamus of schizophrenia patients 59 and we have recently demonstrated that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus can also regulate dopamine signaling via the NAc 60 . Further, the vHipp sends and receives many projections to and from other brain regions beyond the NAc and mPFC. For example, reciprocal connections exist between the basolateral _USER_ID_ (BLA) and vHi
pp 61 and optogenetic inhibition of this BLA-vHipp pathway has been shown to decrease anxiety-like behavior 62 and increase social interaction time 63 , which has been used to model negative symptoms of the disorder. Conversely, activation of the pathway increases anxiety-like behaviors 62 and decreases social interaction time 63 . The BLA has been implicated in schizophrenia 64 , therefore, it is likely that changes in this neural circuit may also contribute to the pathology of schizophrenia.

175881501,"I have just been afraid it would happen anyway. It’s hard to explain. But, surely others here have been in similar situations."
175881502,"That’s a big accomplishment, for both of you. I know it is hard."
175881503,That's cool!
175881504,I had my 16th birthday recently!
175881505,Hmm. I Shall Go Back into My Cavernous Laboratory And Pray For That to Occur For Yuu. Wish Mee Luck (!!!).
175881506,From what I understand I’ll have to be on some form of it till I’m too old to take it. My doc said my body will stop producing testosterone on it’s own after a while due to the injections. I just hope it doesn’t make me go bald lol. I have enough self esteem issues to deal with.
175881507,reality is a part of many chains of evinces birth to death with others birth to deaths much like a centipede with a given time span .
175881508,The last one is my favorite
175881509,I’ve only experienced the first one. Hope I don’t get sick enough to experience the second.
174324944,I gained about 20 pounds on risperidone. Worked it all off with abilify though. Abilify makes me sleep eat sometimes though. So i had to dump all the junk food from the house and fill the fridge with fruit.
175881510,Nope not today but for sure tomorrow.
175881511,My neighbors are head jerks.
175881512,I ate a really really healthy dinner Now that nobody is around I’m brewing hazelnut coffee so I can eat my cookies Made the family clam chowder . They really enjoyed it but I can’t eat that crap. Never know I’m a NE’er

175881513,What’s your delusion and how long have you had it?
175881514,"I weighed 160.8 lbs. this am, so, I’m holding steady. I’m pretty happy."
175881515,"I don’t think complimenting ones eyes is superficial! Complimenting ones boobs are. I get complimented on my cooking, which I love since I work so hard at it and I get complimented on my teeth."
175881516,Your med probably makes you unmotivated. But i bet even without it you wouldnt be much better. Your kind of in that flux state of learned helplessness. Hope you will improve one day my dude. Micro steps will pave the way Merry christmas to you and your fam
175881517,hope i didnt fail it
175881518,"Yes that’s what I’m doing I don’t feel in the right state of mind to seek friendship now but I will later when I’m better too, like you said aswell. What do you have paranoia about btw? I’m sorry to hear that"
175881519,I’d recommend just seeing how you go doing what your doing for 6 months or so. See if you can handle the rigors and demands of doing your 3 days. We are all different and such but the meds really slowed me down. I’m a lot older so I won’t offer anything more than don’t be in a hurry. Take things slowly because that decreases stress and stress is the worst thing for someone with sz. You don’t need to be in a hurry. I know mentally I always was after being diagnosed but that wasn’t the best policy!
174324942,"I always thought schizophreniform to he diagnosed it has to be over a month of symptoms but shorter than 6 months of symptoms. After six months they usually change it to schizophrenia of some kind, or another type of psychotic disorder. I could be wrong on that though. I’m curious to know what their diagnostic reasoning was."
175881520,I would love to be more calm and sociable again
175881521,"I’m like an untamed animal. I don’t vocalize negative remarks anymore, but I still think of smacking people around as soon as they are in my way for any reason. Just don’t call it “giving” to be sociable because that is a trigger word for me. I heard too much about doing things for people just to be nice. I got taken advantage of. I also need courage about speaking up. There’s a balance to living and being social."
175881522,"hey _AT_MENTION_ i was pretty down on myself, but felt better later so i had a shower later at night, still got loads to do, shave, haircut, change bedding, put clothes away, i got dishes done though so thats pretty good. _AT_MENTION_ can i have the woman? lol"
175881523,There’s always one hit wonders. Live off royalties. You only have to write one book.
175881524,"Doh! Fool me once, ... By now, I deserve some award. Never mind. Forget the award. You'll just link to it D:"
174324939,i was treatment resistant and for me the combination risperdal consta 50mg 2 weekly and clozapine daily worked. Maybe you can try risperdal in combination with your clozapine. and who knows maybe then they can down your clozapine then a bit too.
174324948,"I just have internal conversations. Its not stressful anymore. In the start it was frightening cause of all the negative ideas the voices came up with. I learned to keep it to myself these days, to avoid punishment from the psychiatrists. I cope by whistling certain tunes or sing parts of songs. I used to play an instrument that helped me to express myself. I try my hardest to get back into exercising, but the negative symptoms are overwhelming."
175881525,yeah that basically defines my experience in middle school. I remember looking at the other kids in grade school and I always was confused as to why I was not like them. I felt like an alien to them. The best way I can describe it is like if you look at ducks in a pond. You know you’re not the same as them and if you jump in the water they’re all gonna fly away. So you know you’re different from them and you don’t integrate with the rest of them.
175881526,"I feel you on the cysts! I have endometriosis and PCOS and as soon as I have cysts removed new ones appear. I’ve had several rupture, one during sex and I thought I was dying it hurt so bad! My boyfriend thought his penis stabbed me to death! Lol! Probably tmi! I didn’t have sex for a long time after that!"
175881527,"Not necessarily trying to get religious but in regards to auditory hallucinations, I keep hearing the resounding word “Amen.” From different voices even."
175881528,Haha . 152515
174324949,"Because you can have the best life in the world but if you have schizophrenia, it is going to affect you somehow. And this is how it’s affecting you. Even if everything is going your way in life and you have everything you want and need, if you have schizophrenia it is going to manifest itself in some way and you are going to feel it. It’s an insidious, unfair disease and the best you can do is take your medication to control the symptoms and just live your life to the best of your ability and enjoy the good days and hopefully the bad days will be tolerable and hopefully it will get better."
175881529,I’m at 177 lbs. I have a pot belly going on. First time in my life for being this ‘plump’. I’ve maintained this weight for 3 months by just watching what I eat and how much I’m eating. Some days it’s more than others!
175881530,I have the opposite problem. I can’t stop the flow. People and sounds trigger it. I used to have your problem. Are you drinking enough water? Nightmares of being scolded for wet pants or wet beds?
175881531,Depends on if it fits me at all. I need 3 or 4XL for TShirts and XL for pants. I can not get this stuff in regular shops in the city. My clothes are a mix of ‘it finally fits me’ clothes. I disslike how most of them look. But surely better than running around naked with my belly etc…
175881532,I need a new reason for living. Something to get me over the humps and bumps of life.
175881533,"I’m cleaning today: dusting, vacuuming, sweeping, mopping and bathroom. I clean every Friday. Then we’re taking my stepdaughter to see her mom. Sorry it’s nothing worth living through vicariously lol!"
175881534,I have been taking Amisulpride for more than 5 years. I am on 200mg. Except that It gives me huge prolactin level and fatigue it is a miracle med.
175881535,Great news! I hope it goes well for you
175881536,My motivation is dead from the weed. Crap..
175881537,Okay … sorry!
175881538,There’s a fine line between coping behaviors and avoidance behaviors. But the sage isn’t going to harm your house.
175881539,"I don’t know you two well enough, I couldn’t tell if she is a cheater or not. It’s possible she’s cheating, but then again it’s just as possible that she’s faithful. People surprise me all the time with the crazy sh*t they do and the secrets they have and the stuff they’re getting away with."
175881540,"Coffee always motivated me to study when I was taking classes at my college. a giant thing of coffee would get me going. Caffeine always tends to inspire and motivate me, especially when I haven't had it in awhile. That and music"

175881542,Fell asleep again. But I needed that.
174324945,"See, that gives me hope. I’ve got 23 years down, hearing a peer I respect making it 40 gives me hope that I can make it too. Cheers _NAME_! You’re a grandmaster of SZ mental Kung fu!"

175881545,Just until I see my doctor and yes I’m going to tell her
175881546,I try to get back on track as a programmer. I do some volunteer nonsense . It difficult given I don’t care for anything at all. The biggest obstacle for me is that I just don’t want to work not even for food. And that is coming from someone who experienced starvation. If you want to work you will.
175881547,"Liking transgender women still makes you straight. They’re still women. It just means you don’t get hung up on genitals. But just a word of caution, transgender porn is mostly fetishizing and very unrealistic."

175881550,"Replacing the packing in the incision on my chest went well. No pain Picked up some tasty treats at the grocery store on the way home. I got miffed at my ride because he had his phone turned off. When I came out of the grocery store, I had to wait 20 minutes for him to show up. The good part of that is that I came down pretty quickly. I can stay pissed for a while once I get stirred up, it’s been a problem for me my whole life"

174324950,"I saw a video of a young woman who swore by it, says it returned her to normal and allowed her to finish her college courses. She had been on several different APs and they all caused her problems or didn’t work. I’m thinking about trying it after I’m settled in a month or two. Here, I found the video:"
175881558,"This happened during my last relapse. I somehow by playing the game started to feel hypnotized and started adding people from a chat. I thought that global chat was somehow private to me and was interviewing me. I stayed all night up chatting and going for a smoke. In the morning i told my mom that i have been employed as game tester and game perfomance tester. I was truly happy, I even posted it on facebook. How dumb was I to realize in the hospital thag it was all fake. I hate delusions, why they look so real?"
175881559,"I get violent thought, too. Usually involves throwing around furniture. But it always just a thought. Consider coping techniques. Breathing, thought stopping, time out, eating/drinking something, or talking to a trusted co-worker. It sounds like your suffering. I’d use talk therapy."
174324957,Don’t worry to much.

175881562,"When I recovered after three years of sza I came off meds successfully for five years with help of pdoc. But after those five years I relapsed and had to return to meds. Since then I tried to come off meds over and over and all without success. I’d end up in hospital repeatedly. My pdoc thinks it’s a bad idea for me to come off meds now. Along with amisulpride 200mg and lamotrigine 150mg, I take olanzapine 5mg daily and found that at a low dose it helps my depression. If I take 2,5mg I’m ok too, but when I once tried to come off it completely I relapsed a week later. So returned to taking it. I agree with the others on here - always consult with your pdoc first."
175881563,"_AT_MENTION_ thank you, you are very right"
175881564,"It’s 1:18 am here in California. It’s all good, but I haven’t gone to sleep yet. Hope I can sleep, I’ve been staying up til 5:00 am lately. Got my days and night mixed up, I sleep until 2-3 in the afternoon lol."
175881565,"Unfortunately, it is true for some. Is it a conspiracy or a delusion if it is real? Some people are just idiots."
175881566,"yes, idk what the toilet roll is about lol put a whole different spin on it"
175881567,Just took a walk to pickup more of my requests from the library today. 3 books and 3 DVDs. I have one more book request but it’s currently checked out but when it gets turned in it will be held for me.
175881568,"Thanks. I am glad we can reconcile. But for one, I never denied it was my fault. If I did not know it was my fault, I would not have reported myself to the police or hospital. I hope you can see that. A true psychopath with no remorse would have continued on and no one would ever have even known."
175881569,Good luck to you I hope u get the meidisine you need0
175881570,"$7.25 in _NAME_. I was thinking it was higher than that. I’ve never worked for less than $12/hr personally, but I don’t want to lose my ssdi for a couple years."
175881571,I did that with packs of cigarettes routinely… I know the feeling.
175881572,"I don’t think it’s immoral to collect benefits. For whatever reasons some people are not successful with a full-time job and that can bring a lot of uncertainty and insecurity. Just like it’s better I think to let vulnerable people stay home during this pandemic, vulnerable people with schizophrenia can do better in a calm environment. Work is often stressful. I’m trying for both. My application for benefits still has not been approved. It’s been a year so far and I’m just waiting for them to deny it three times so I can appeal and get a hearing. But they are taking their time and have not even determined whether I’m disabled itll take a few months. I was approved for low income housing but haven’t moved yet. It would be nice to move out of my mom’s house and have at least a little independence. I am on food stamps and medicaid, and I qualify for affordable housing for my disability. I wanted to move there but I was worried about leaving my mom during the pandemic, and was worried 
because the area I would be in has more cases of the virus and was sort of closed in. Plus I don’t have transportation yet so I’d be stuck there pretty much. Once I get approved for disability I will be able to move into the low income apartment and have my own space. Until then I live with my mom. I feel safe here though. I live in a really nice area. My mom has schizophrenia too. She can no longer drive and she’s 52. I have had schizophrenia most of my life or more than half of it. It has already impacted my education and job training. I feel its unfair that I have to fight for benefits to prove I can’t work because I haven’t had enough jobs. I had schizophrenia before college and in high school. So how would I have been able to work enough to get credits?? It’s just frustrating how hard it would be to get financial assistance for my disability. Part of my illness is that it’s not obvious i have schizophrenia to everyone. I have pushed and pushed myself to be like everyone else and it always b
ackfired. I don’t regret trying to finish college, but that’s also where a lot of bad things happened to me. I would rather just pursue my passions with extra help. Not be put in constant mental and emotional suffering trying to do a job I can’t do. So far I have not found one that does not exhaust me and hearing voices is a huge factor. If I over-stress myself my symptoms get worse. I have a mix between bipolar and schizophrenia so I burn out and get depression too. On the surface I can seem perfectly fine. And I want to fit in and have a rewarding career more than anything. The cognitive deficits really suck, I hate it. I used to be able to soak up information now I feel I’ve been left behind. If I can do it I want to pursue certification in Medical Billing and coding. If I succeed I may not need benefits. I really hope I can learn this. It would be great to have a job!!!"
175881573,"honey it’s a running joke by the long standing members that _PERSON_ gets more suspensions than anyone. Can you not have a brain, or an opposing opinion, can you not say how you feel? haha."
175881574,"Yesterday I went to the park to walk for 3 mins as per goals set with hubby. It was too wet and icy to walk. So I sat in my car for like 20 mins just to there. When I left the winding road there was a man on the street standing in front of his car with his phone close up to his eye taking pictures of me. Pointed directly at my car and me. I looked at him and he stared at me and put his phone down. 100 % was taking pictures of me. There was absolutely nothing else to take pictures of. He just stood there after and was surprised when I caught him. He stepped back and got into his car. I drove away and decide to go back and see if he’s there and his car was gone. He passed me as I drove back there and I could see into his car and he was dressed like someone who would be an agent. He looks exactly like one. I know I have paranoia that stuck with me re the degree of hypervigilence when I’m ill but I also know that people DO follow me at periods of time. I could 100% tell this was real this time and 
I don’t know what I can do. I called my hubby when I got home and I could tell he did not believe me and told me to just go ahead and run the errands etc. Now he thinks just because I do get paranoia when ill that it’s just paranoia, which is just stereotyping me. I drove through my neighbourhood but he was no where to be found. I tested to see if he was following me far behind but no. Then I watched as I ran some errands and I couldn’t see the car. He may have stopped because he knew I saw him. They hate it when I catch on. I feel my _NAME_ is being tracked which is easy to happen, how else would he findme? It’s happened before, they show up with cameras where they would have no way to find except to track my husband’s cell text messages. Sometimes I need to tell someone when it happens and I’m terrified bbut I don’t want to lose my husband because he thinks I’m too hard or unattractive to love, I try to be normal. I hate talking to anyone about these things because they think I’m just ill 
and argue with me so I often handle it myself when I can. Keep blinds closed, stay in as much as possible, etc. Do you get people not believing you bc of mental illness when something did actually did happen??? It’s really bugging me."
175881575,"I don’t understand, dude"
175881576,They told me a cure was 20 years off over 25 years ago. Now they’re telling me it’s 20 years off again this year. I think the answer is that it’s 20 years off from whatever the current date is. [shrug]
175881577,I applied and got seen by an inspector but he was critical of some money’s I had transferred into my account. I had a few weeks to give him proof of where the money came from but I never did. Just got a letter today saying I have been refused because I didn’t provide that proof. Not sure what to do now? What do you think?

175881581,I used to be unable to go out because of panic attacks. I did exposure which meant starting small by going a short distance rom the house. I would start having a panic attack and I would sit down and ride out the panic attack. I did this every day and within three weeks I stopped having panic attacks. It wasn’t nice but it solved the problem.
175881582,If you don’t actually hear the voice then I think it’s more of an intrusive thought. I get both but I’m used to the thoughts. When the voice is mean it issues commands and insults and used to drive me to biting my arm. When it’s nice I don’t mind it. Luckily it’s nice most of the time.
175881583,I am legally capable of making that choice already They can’t force me unless I become unwell
175881584,_PERSON_ try propranolol 40mg or atenolol 50mg (Less side effects) in the morning. It's amazing at killing anxiety. I don't check my pulse anymore and I used to check it hundreds of times a day.
175881585,"Easy, none without SZ. All with SZ"
175881586,I want cheesecake. Or cookie dough. Or a mug brownie. Ughh it's only day 2 of 21 days of no sweets lol.

175881588,I read it as “Why do AP’s make us fart?” That would have been funny if true lol
175881589,"I hope she doesn’t end up getting it, then my brother in-law and my niece would subsequently have it too. And I hope I wasn’t exposed either because she dropped off some stuff and money the other day."

175881593,That’s cool. 151515#5
175881594,_NAME_ got lucky when he found you!
175881595,"I only feel guilty because I know a lot of people who deserve to be on disability, but aren’t able to (for a variety of reasons). I lucked into it, it’s totally unfair"
175881596,I got shunned from the local church. I used to sing in the choir as a boy till 19. Until i got a sixteen year old choir-girl pregnant. The mother was a Church Warden. Not one of my best moments.
175881597,yeah thats truth…!!! If he succeed i think some one will murder him…!!!
175881598,Yea…did you take your meds?You should talk to your doctor and you will feel better
175881599,"What if there was a new mental illness and it is called buttoba, and it means people are afraid of other people’s butts."
174324958,I'm writing a letter to the government to make funding for cures for negative symptoms of schizophrenia
175881600,"I’ve had this problem several times. I did some researching on the internet and I read a lot of times it’s from being a little dehydrated. I drink some cold ice water about 8-14 ounces while I’m listening to upbeat music. It helps tremendously. I also had blood work done and my iron and vitamin d level were low so I take vitamins for both of those (only iron occasionally but a big dose of vitamin d! I’ve heard several people tell me b12 helps too. During the day if I hit a brick wall from being tired I will force myself to walk around the block. Getting up to do it is the hardest part, but a small price to pay to reboot my energy and get my endorphins going."
174324970,"That’s what I will be doing this week, add 2mg then 5mg Abilify to my 3mg Risperdal."
175881601,I knew when I was 13 that something wasn’t right…but from my environment mental health was seen as full of crazy people. I pushed it to the side.So I didn’t get help for years.
175881602,"Being born asexual would have solved a lot of my problems, because the men on my Dad’s side of the family have an exceptionally high sex drive. But, I think mine is starting to drop off with age, finally."
175881603,I just added you!
175881604,"I'm on a puma kick. This Russian couple are always posting videos of their pet puma. I love that cat, it purs and meows just like a little house cat. And marks its territory. The channel is called I_am_puma I think."
175881605,"Sounds like you’re referring to hallucinations, which aren’t always delusions. I have positive hallucinations (nice voices) but I realize they are the product of a misfiring brain so they don’t count as delusions."
175881606,Why? I may have it you’re right!!!
175881607,"Topo, I understand, I am your age with a 76 yr old husband. I signed us up 4 times on our county's website. It took 4 attempts before we got registered with them. Got a notice we are in line & haven't heard nothing. Yesterday morning early, I went to CVS website & got both of us an appt for Tuesday & our 2nd shot for the 30th! Go online & check out all of the pharmacies in your city & see who is offering the vaccine. More vaccines are availble now. Good luck."
175881608,And that would be that I would not want my murderer to go to prison for it. I feel I have been a pain in the neck to people and more than one person might want to kill me. So be it. I don’t want to lose sleep over it be it about myself or my murderer.
174324953,Not everyone has a wonderful recovery from schizophrenia as they don’t respond to any med out there and a lot of the people who have ended up homeless since deinstitutilation are and have been mentally ill. While it would be terrible to lock everyone up who is mentally ill since some of us can be productive citizens the worst case scenarios need someplace to go other than a jail or a street corner. And with few new drugs coming in lately it looks like those people will continue to exist. I hate to say that because in my idealistic youth I felt that we all could recover from mental illness. Since then I’ve met people who will never recover. In a sense I’ve become one of those people and living in a group home is the result of that.
175881609,"chicken pie tonight, then strawberries and ice cream"
175881610,"Don’t try to court the phenomenon, just try to escape it. I’ll test my TB and give my findings on what works to treat it."

175881617,Persecutory delusion- this one is still ongoing.
175881618,How do you know about your alters?
175881619,Remote work is great in this political climate. Good luck.
175881620,I want to be slim again too. I got slim for a short time in 2010 and felt my best ever but I quickly gained the weight back.
175881621,Are you still modifying your meds?
175881622,I’m wondering if they’re doing it so other insurances won’t take me after _PERSON_ gets rid of Obamacare. Or that they’re going to use it to kick me off their insurance plan. Or something else I don’t know about.
175881623,Sounds like anxiety from akathisia. Raising the dose won’t help. Best be on the lowest dose.
175881624,"If we’re not doing anything differently with our diet and only changing the Amyloban 3399 and feeling an improvement, it’s safe to say that is the cause of the change. I’m on board with the gluten and dairy-free angle, it’s worth a try. I’m currently going wheat and dairy-free for my rheumatoid arthritis, so it might take care of my last 1% of symptoms."
175881625,"I don't know yet, haven't decided"
175881626,I know when we’re irritated things that other people do (such as the way someone eats or chews) really annoys us. Is he making you go or did something happen?
175881627,"Is that real piano, or a digital piano? Also beautiful playing."
174324963,Have you tried other antipsychotics in the past? What makes this antipsychotic different from all the other ones? Is this a third generation antipsychotic?
175881628,"Your music I find interesting. I didn’t know you are a woman. When you became a soldier, what did you think when they handed you a gun?"
175881629,Science can’t create a blade of grass.
175881630,Humans don’t go out of there way to hurt strangers. I imagine your a good person. Guys are sometimes loud because there insecure and want to intimidate other guys and also to get a females attention. It’s an attempt at being an alpha male. If it came from outside it’s most likely somebody being obnoxious simply ignore it. Your safe.
175881631,"Does anyone feel like a fraud? I struggle with this a lot. It mainly has to do with my conflicts with family members who try to tell me that I don’t have a physical disability, and that I’ve been lied to, or I’m lying to myself. Sometimes I feel like I am faking my symptoms when I know that I’m not. I know my hallucinations, my physical symptoms, and everything is real, but I’m constantly worried about someone exposing me as a fraud. I know this occurs a lot in the physical disability community but do you guys also have this problem? If so, how do you reassure yourself and know that your symptoms are true and genuine? Thanks for your help."
175881632,Mods being dicks to innocent posters?
175881633,Well me and my partner were in the middle of trying for a baby. According to the fertility test I’m fertile at the moment. And she wouldn’t stop ringing my phone. Then she was parked outside the house. Yeah it really pissed me off.
175881634,"I don’t watch TV usually but sometimes I look at it when I eat in the kitchen. My dad watches the news. I watch the soccer world cup and important matches of the champions league. I did watch soccer today while eating but I get abdominal pain if I sit for more than 30 min. My Dr sent me to do a liver scan, he said its bcz of obesity and fatty liver disease. He said to exercise and eat healthier but I can’t, at least I am taking fiber supplements to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure, its working. I can’t sit for more than 30 min."
175881635,Being as fair minded as I can it took 27 years from when _PERSON_’s was an official dx for me to be given that dx. That’s still a long time.
175881636,"I am grateful for my gal and her son. i am also gratefull for this forum and all of you and your supportiveness. As you can see I am grateful for many thing, people and places as well. In fact someone might say at times i am overly grateful."
175881637,"So along with Hope _PERSON_ that’s three positives for today, right?"
175881638,"Sometimes I let the dishes pile up in the sink. Cleaning floors is also not my specialty. But in reality I do a hell of a lot keeping this house up, by myself"
175881639,"Good morning guys Last night I wrote a new poem. I’d love to share it with you. It is written in danish but I have translated it Sultne blikke, lystige smil Kroppe der bevæger sig synkront Sveden pibler frem Danser med djævelen _NAME_ømmelse, selvhad Følelsen af ikke at høre til Hovedet fyldt Danser med djævelen Alt og intet, giv dig hen Måske man ikke skal høre til Skil dig ud DANS med djævelen! Hungry eyes, passionate smiles Bodies moving insync Sweat trickling Dancing with the devil Jugdment, selfloathing The feeling of not belonging Head filled Dancing with the devil All or nothing, give in Maybe you don’t need to belong Stick out DANCE with the devil!"
175881640,I care if you hurt someone. I don’t think it’s ok to hurt beings. For what reason? If it’s for attention then that’s just awful. There are other ways you could get attention if that’s what you craving. You could just ask someone to give you some time… You could give time to someone and maybe get some back. It is against my morals to hurt anyone. I am against hurting animals etc too such as factory farming. Those who were very bad to me I hope the law will keep them away but I don’t want to hurt them.
175881641,My sinuses are acting up again! I’m hoping that it’s seasonal allergies Tree pollen is usually high
175881642,I bought an iced tea and a piece of pumpkin bread last night when I was at Starbucks with my friend.
174324966,I’ve been to hell and worse. I don’t want to go back. I believe in karma and possibly sin. The aliens wanted me to be a Christian. Not sure why. I’m immortal. I can die physically but come back alive in time to like 2013 via reincarnation. _PERSON_ would be jealous that I’ve been outside the sim and helped run it. But i rather be like him than poor and a paranoid schizophrenic. Thank God I don’t hear voices. I guess I’ve been to other dimensions or worlds for lack of a better word. I’m perpetually schizophrenic meaning I’ve lived exact lives like this billions or trillions of times. Isn’t that hell or worse? Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. A cure would be nice. I’m hoping the norovirus vaccine will help somehow. I drink energy drinks because I need to cope and I’m stressed. I might change meds but vrsylar is alright. I smoke too. I’m broke. Stimulants would be nice but no doctor in their right mind would give them to me. I 
still don’t know if Christianity is true. We live in a computer simulation. Not sure why people get schizophrenia. It is unfortunate. I’m just a statistic and i don’t want to be. I want more in life.
174324965,"Now I’m reading all the dating threads on here and I’m thinking (way) back on my own dating days. I dated some really pretty, nice women. And instead of leaving it alone except to reminisce and feel good about it and play it over in my mind occasionally, now I’m wondering what they saw in me. I had a real pretty girlfriend and she seemed to like me a lot and she also happened to be schizophrenic too. I just got paranoid that she might of thought badly of me. Ah, screw it. She was pretty and went out with me, no use in wrecking good memories."
175881643,"63, tired of living now, to much pain"
175881644,I cant handle stress at all
175881645,"I am functioning decently, I am high functioning for now. I can work and whatnot but constant long hour weeks where I only get 1 day of definitely make me feel the effects of illness"
175881646,"ah that’s good! I hope it will be long time for that to happen still… but it’s scary huh, being dependent on people so much… like what will happen when you don’t have them anymore."
175881647,Omg I have Spotify!!! Add me! I canceled my Apple Music subscription! Add me and send it to me.
175881648,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ Yes I sell prints and originals Very basic prices, I’ll pm you."
175881649,LS! A pedicurist visits me every six weeks. This is necessary because I have diabetes type 2. There is a 10% risk of amputation once you have diabetes type 2. She cuts my toenails and removes the hard skin. Because I am overweight I can not do this myself. The insurance does not pay for this.
175881650,Pi 15171993…

174324982,Their corrupt diagnosis practises need to stop. How dare they try and put this on me. I am not playing their game any longer. This is beyond a joke now and I have had enough of it
175881656,"They work on dopamine receptors, there are antagonists that block dopamine, and partial agonists that level out dopamine levels from too high or too low, that’s as much as I know."

175881658,Thats my life. At least I am trying.
175881659,Would like to know. _PHONE_NO_
175881660,Kindness. Always kindness. If you exude it in all that you do (or try to anyway) even the worst people can’t help themselves. You can only make things better with kindness.
175881661,"Hi _PERSON_ hope your O.K TBH you or nobody can blockout thoughts the Brain does not have a firewall built into it, though you can choose to ignore a lot of the attempts at triggering and trauma bonding by keeping distracted and aware of the voices nature to induce some kind of emotional abuse/blackmail."
175881662,"It is a real good reason to use as little meds as possible. It is not a reason to quit meds you truly need though. I showed the article about the guy with almost no brain. He was functioning relatively okay. If you walk around delusional thinking you should kill yourself or talk to trees or whatever, you are not “relatively okay”."
175881663,"It was, but the sharp pain only lasted a second. It aches to mention it, though."
175881664,"On and off for the first 3-4 years, then compliant for about 3-4 years. Then off completely for about 3-4 years. After that I’ve been completely med compliant and take my meds religiously. Started in 1993. No discernible side effects for quite a few years now. It’s gotten better and better since I stopped ??????? around."

175881666,There is _USER_ID_ support group if you live in USA. You meet other people with mental illness. They are very supportive and understanding.
175881667,"I don’t own a TV nor I read the news, because of how it’s systematically designed one or another way to spread the confusion among the groups thus getting angry at each other in the process. I know there are more to it (good and bad) but my general consensus is to shut down all the bad signaling. I might “alienate” myself here by saying this, but I’m really glad that my fellow American friends elected _NAME_. Everything is going to be Okay we can calm down."
175881668,"Uh, nope. Especially not if you’ve seen my neighbors. You’re delusional, mate. Best to discuss this with your treatment team."
175881669,"I rarely am unable to move. I already had an hour or even longer, in the last couple weeks, where I was laying in bed and starring at my own hand all the time. Years ago if I was into a heavy delusion I wouldn’t move and breathe extremely deep."
175881670,I always have to go back a few episodes because I fall asleep!

175881674,It’s ????-ing great! Good job guys! It’s awesome
175881675,I’m supposed to be working but I keep thinking about school. I just want to work on my assignment now and get it done ASAP. I’m hyper focused but on the wrong thing.
175881676,"Lol For me too, it made me angry and suspicious all the time."
175881677,Hi _NAME_ Thanks for your reply I started taking 5mg of Olanzapine on Wed night and I have been sleeping much better so that's good news. I have taken _PERSON_ root for years it also helps but not with this recent bout of Insomnia. _PERSON_
175881678,yeh i guess so… I dont really discuss the meaning of paintings if I am talking to other ppl who paint I just wanna know the cheapest places to get quality enough paint and such
175881679,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ was not calling you a bad person. She is trying to help you see that you sound different today than you have recently. You adore your grandfather. You have years of memories with him! You love him! It makes sense that you are grieved by what’s happening to his body. Stress makes your illness worse. It flares up. But you can’t avoid this stress. You can’t change the situation your family is in right now. What you can do is accept the needed help to formulate a plan that protects you from your illness. Be open with your family. Let them know you are struggling. Also let them know what you are doing to help yourself and what you need help with. Explain your situation to your doctor. Make it known that you need help, but you can not go into the hospital at this time because your family needs you. (Keep in mind, it matters most to your family that you are safe, so be open to going into the hospital if need be.) Write down practical ways to lower the stress. Your health an
d your time spent with your grandfather are priorities right now. What else can you postpone? What can you accept is not going to receive your attention at this time? Be open to what others suggest. Accept that your illness is going to lie to you and confuse your thoughts. Other people will be able to notice more easily than you. Consider their words. You are not yourself. You don’t need to be afraid. You do not know if you are going to lose insight to the extent that you have before. But if you do, you know you have built a support team to help you. We’re here for you! Keep talking with us!"
175881680,"I feel yucky today. Physically. I had to will myself to come to work. I had to come to work because I am the only one that can run payroll and it had to be ran today. So I came in. But I am taking tomorrow off. I already got it approved. I tried to get my kitty to the vet today, but she wasn't having it. She is very skittish and hard to catch. She went outside (she is indoor/outdoor and goes in and out as she pleases through the doggy door). So I got her to come inside. Then she went under my bed. Then I coaxed her out with some treats. I was holding her and petting her and talking softly to her. My Dad was on hand as well, but as soon as she saw the kennel, she got the strength of an ox, we got her partway in a couple of times but she got out and the last time she got out she went back under my bed. There was no way I was going to be able to get her to come out again after all of that. So I called the vets and told them it wasn't happening today. So they asked if we want to try again tomorrow. We 
said sure. We'll see if she has forgiven us by then. I might try to go to PetSmart tonight to get a different kind of crate, one that opens from the top or something because I have the hardest time getting her into either of the two that we have. Poor baby. She was probably frightened to death. So tomorrow I can rest, try to get the kitty to the vet (at least it is just for a check up--she's not sick or anything) and hopefully have my depression clear up a bit. HUGS everyone, _PERSON_"
175881681,"I’m just doing a little here and there. I’m getting ready to leave on Sunday. I’ve cleaned out the bathroom most of the way and half cleaned it. I have maybe 10 more minutes of work to do in there if that. And tomorrow morning I’ll go to the grocery store first thing to be there for boxes. That’s what they said to do when I called them. I went through all my clothes. Got rid of 2 big bags and packed 2 big bags. So I just have one small bag left to pack of clothes. I’ll maybe have 3 boxes to pack in the bedroom and 1 in the kitchen. That’s it. I don’t have much. I didn’t bring much with me when I came and I haven’t collected much. The furniture is going to the curb with a “free” sign on it because Goodwill isn’t taking donations right now. Tomorrow I have 2 doctor’s appointments. Both by phone. It was good they got a hold of me today to confirm and let me know they were by phone or I would have gone to the offices like normal. Why don’t they tell you when you schedule i
t that it will be by phone? That seems silly. Well one of them I could understand that they didn’t know it was going to be by phone but the other appointment I just made yesterday, they had to have known but didn’t say a word. I could have driven all the way over there for nothing. Oh well, it’s fine. I know now, so it’s all good. I’m seeing my regular doctor to try to get some Ativan for the trip home, I need like 3 mg to sedate me and the Pdoc won’t give me that much. But if she won’t give it to me I’ll see what he can do, some is better than none. I freak out going on the highway."
175881682,"On my way to buy brownie mix. what is the best kind, Ghiradelli or something?"
175881683,What helps me with constipation is high fiber foods and magnesium supplement
175881684,I’m sorry that happened. That was very hurtful.
174324969,"I actually do have a blog but I know we’re not allowed to share it here. Yeah my life is a mess. Who knows that I would have schizophrenia AND muscular dystrophy together? I post a lot about my story on here, and about having muscular dystrophy because it’s often intertwined. Muscular dystrophy surprisingly affects the mind so often as well because I’m often reminded about how I’m losing my ability to do certain things. Be careful not to get intertwined with delusions though about conspiracy stuff! I also talk about my delusions too in my blog and I often read my friend’s blog as well who has bipolar w/ psychosis. It’s a good coping mechanism so I write as often as I can."
175881685,Sounds tough. Good luck in your search.
175881686,I rather take the limitless med without side effects. Imagine neurolink rofl. Be like elon musk. But then everyone would know and want it and competitive edge is gone. Too many elon musks lol…

175881688,"Here in the US, I’ve found our typical system works as this, Least it did in my case. massive episode, acute, tossed in the ward, scared to come out of my room to eat or socialize. Nurse checked in every few hours, doctor once a day for maybe 5-10 minutes. They got me through the worst of it until I started to come down and regain insight, probably thanks to the massive AP’s they pumped into my arm. Told me to find a Pdoc, and released me. That was the end and I was left to find my own way. Luckily my family helped me a lot, some people don’t have that luxury. Or housing, or ability to pay for medications and treatment. I’m working on a new team right now, and am hopeful that my care will be better than it has in the past"
175881689,"My therapist gave me homework that might help you. She told me I have to do something I suck at at least once a week. So I started playing guitar. I had taught myself a bit, then fell out of practice and never had the motivation to get better again. Because the point was to be bad, and not to do well, it took the pressure off learning. Now, I’m actually pretty good at guitar. I started in January for half an hour a week."

I was bad on this before, maybe because of the negatives… But now i throw energy in the day, in the goal to be as normal as possible, but i end up overexcited and mostly - somatizing… Who else was having many physical symptoms too because of your sz? I guess i need to calm down, not to pursue the energy so much, but i just got fed up by my ‘‘dead’’ state for decades . Is it a big problem to have physical symptoms too? I should stop worry on that? I wonder if its common in sz to feel badly physicaly too?.. I guess the zyprexa should work on this too one day?"
175881692,I feel nauseous from the anxiety of waiting for certain things right now.

175881695,Sorry you’re feeling this way. I’ve felt something similar. We just have to remember that we have an illness and doubting that illness is part of it.
175881696,"Perhaps you are anxious, anxiety can transfer into irritability. If you need an ativan, you should take it. So what if your brother sees? He knows you’re ill"
175881697,okay i see. _PHONE_NO_
175881698,What do you mean?
175881699,Yes in the U.S. The LSD bit is sort of like being in psychosis so imagine these things really playing out in your reality after psychosis. That is what I worry about. Also someone in the car that was with us called my boyfriend a spook and he has the signs for it.

Currently all good but on the regular dose of risperidone so will see what happens when its lowered. I have monthly appiontments now to prevent any relapse, perhaps I should speak to Pdoc about softgels again as there are some studies out there on its use for relapse prevention."
174324972,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Study on risk factors of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by antipsychotics and its correlation with symptoms of schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, General psychiatry , 2019 Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are one of the most common and neglected side effects during the treatment of schizophrenia. The risk factors of EPS in Chinese patients with schizophrenia and its relationship with psychiatric symptoms and mood symptoms of schizophrenia remain unknown.The main objective of this study is to explore the risk factors of EPS caused by antipsychotics and the relationship between EPS and psychotic symptoms and mood symptoms of schizophrenia.This study included 679 patients with schizophrenia who have met the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition. Patients were divided into the EPS group and the non-EPS group according to the scale rating criteria and whether the anticholinergics have been used. The 
differences between demographic data and characters of drug intake were compared between the two groups, and the risk factors of EPS were selected between those factors. Correlation analysis was performed on the severity of schizophrenia (Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) score) and EPS scale (Simpson-_NAME_ Scale (SAS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score) in 679 patients. The differences between the PANSS subscale score and the CDSS score between the EPS group and the non-EPS group were compared.Compared with the non-EPS group, the EPS group patients are older, and they have a longer duration since first prescribed antipsychotics. The EPS group patients have higher frequency of atypical antipsychotics polytherapy and typical and atypical antipsychotics polytherapy or combined treatments with mood stabilisers. Logistic regression analysis shows that antipsychotics with high D2 receptor antagonisti
c effect and illness duration are the risk factors of EPS. The SAS score was significantly correlated with PANSS negative score, PANSS general psychopathological score and PANSS total score. The BARS scale score was significantly correlated with PANSS positive score, PANSS general psychopathological score, PANSS total score and CDSS total score. The AIMS scale score was significantly correlated with PANSS negative score. Compared with the non-EPS group, the EPS group patients have significantly higher PANSS negative score, PANSS general psychopathological score, PANSS total score and CDSS total score.Antipsychotic drugs with high D2 receptor antagonism and disease duration are risk factors of EPS in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. The severity of various types of EPS is significantly correlated with the psychiatric and mood symptoms of schizophrenia, and psychiatric symptoms and mood symptoms were significantly more severe in the EPS group. The occurrence of EPS is associated with poor treatment outcome 
of schizophrenia."
175881706,"Hi everyone. Long day at work today. I'm trying to help the owners and upper management in NY understand CA HR laws. I'm not sure I'm being heard or not. They want to make changes to the leave that we are allowed and how it is accrued but CA has a bunch of laws about this. I don't get to be ""in the loop"" either. I gave them a bunch of info and then it's like, well we'll let you know what we decide. Sucks. I know I'm just a lowly employee but my undergrad is in this major, I know what I'm talking about! No one cares. Blah. I got to see regular T last night. She is moving her office because the current place she works is closing at the end of the year. So I am going to see her on the 11th of January. She said if she isn't on my insurance panel yet she will just see me for free. I feel sort of weird about that, but I'm glad I have an appointment to look forward to. I gotta work up the courage to break up with Pastor _PERSON_. I don't think he's helping me. I want to SH. But I don't want to SH. But I 
want to SH. I'm having a lot of anxiety. I'm having hallucinations but they are manageable for the most part, just visuals, no auditory ones. And I'm super bored at work right now. So lame. Just want to be at home. Having motivation problems today. Let me see if I can come up with something positive: I had Starbucks this morning. That was nice. And it's Wednesday which means only two more days of work this week. So over it. Hugs All, _PERSON_"

175881726,I was mostly fine when I left. Bus was late and I had the intrusive thought that since I wouldn’t be able to catch the next bus to work and would be downtown that it was a sign from the universe that I should go jump off a building. So I went home instead. I feel like such a failure and a faker and ugly and fat. I seriously hate myself and I have a laundry list of reasons why some of why I’m too ashamed to tel even my therapist. I’m just a bad person and deserve all the he’ll I’ve been put thro all the things I called abuse I deserve it all and more. I want to cut myself at the least but really I want to end my life completely. I feel completely broken

175881740,"What helps me is to remind myself that I am not a child. And as an adult, I am capable of handling the situation. I get the child idea when people inadvertently treat me like one in an effort to help what is a mental illness, not a 2nd childhood.

174324983,"I'm beginning to doubt I ever had a manic episode, might just be schizophrenic or sza depressed"
174324981,"I think positive symptoms are the worst, as I am completely lost and unable to function on any level as they’re debilitating Cognition is my second worse I think. At times I can really struggle with this. Negatives don’t bother ‘as’ much, but they’re still there and make everything such an effort. I wouldn’t get complacent about the positives not being so bad. For me they were really severe."
175881741,I am 100 times better on Zoloft than from before I was taking it
175881742,Nope. I think 4.5- 6mg should work.
175881743,"Yeah absolutely. Analyzing it i think it came from having psychosis at such a young age. It made me experience the world in a vastly different way than everyone else. I couldn’t connect with others and it made me age faster mentally compared to other children. So as a result, I did not feel human."

175881747,I’m flagging your whole thread…mwhahaha!
175881748,"I would say I’ve been treated the worst, and messed with to cruel degrees by doctors, usually not psychiatrists, just physicians. A couple times they were so mean I left the ER. They had problems with seeing my past (admittedly ridiculous) behavior as me, and not my illness. Family has mostly forgiven me, some family members have seriously completely shocked me at how open minded and supportive they can be. Doctors are mean, psychiatrists are usually pretty cool, but they can be mean too, but those times I probably deserved it. Nurses can be amazing and not so amazing too. Rant over."
174324987,I guess it’s good that I don’t stop meds when I have doubts about my diagnosis

175881754,Even with my bf around. I’m an only child so I know it well. I can’t go on I feel like I’ll never be happy. The meds may need adjustment. Does anyone here feel lonely in their sz?

175881758,Awww neat bb! Yes thank you I decorated it myself!
175881759,"Yeah, if your pills look different I would for sure search Google. If you look at the pill and Google “pill white round EN” Google results should come back with perphenazine as the result. That would be a good way to know if they gave you the right pills or not. And if they didn’t, definitely talk to the manager at the pharmacy. Maybe someone here knows how to report that. But it’s a very serious matter, so definitely report it. Maybe _AT_MENTION_ or _AT_MENTION_ knows who to report it to."

174324985,"I’m better than I was 5 years ago yet my job situation is just as bad. I worked briefly with a work placement in IT, yet that was is 2015/2016 and only lasted a few months. The delusions are an incredibly annoying aspect of schizophrenia and something I am happy has ended. I no longer have differing views on who I am or my background, yet found my childhood confusing. I want to find employment as soon as possible, yet in the meantime want to move into supported housing. This is, housing for those with mental health problems."
175881765,"Oh I thought I should mention, when it was really bad years ago I followed my voice’s instructions to pour water over my laptop. Destroyed a 1500 dollar mac airbook, and they haven’t gone down in price since. It’s definitely a good thing that I’m not following instructions anymore."
174324991,Something like that.
175881766,I feel very fatigued I’m going to have my lymph checked from the sound of what potentially could happen. I literally just sit at my computer all day these days. I feel like a fat blob. I hope to get this settled or started this month.
175881767,_AT_MENTION_ I drink lots of great value purified water no soda but coffee with sugar and creamer Tuesday and Thursday so I guess I can cut that out and add in dried or canned fruit. Do you think hard candy would help?

Anyway he started troubleshooting and the guy asks him to create a parent ticket and he’s like oh we don’t do that unless more than one person is having an issue.....lol so he’s saying this to his boss. 3 seconds later...oh wait oh I’m so sorry I didn’t realize it was you ...lol. I was cracking up.

175881772,"Sorry to hear. Just to let you know, sometimes blood in urine has np real concrete cause. I kept having it and had all sorts of tests including a bladder scan where they put the camera i side and no cause. Was just there. It is possible to e benign. I hope that is her case, too."

175881785,"From what little I managed to gather, it appears to me that every hallucination character or voice in the head acts in one of the following two ways. They threaten the victim. They argue with the victim. In my case my voices often try to rationalise and justify their presence, and my delusions, much like many other victims report. For a long time I believed that if indeed voices tell me something that I am opposed to, then it must mean that their source is another entity. Otherwise I would have only imagined company that is pleasant to me. It is observed that those who suffered head traumas become more aggressive in time. Even banal headaches, teeth pain, eye pain, ear pain, result in a very irritable subject (I know from personal experience). They theorise that increased aggression is a self-defense mechanism triggered by the body in reaction to damage. My question is, are there similar theories that explain the reason as to why hallucinations from different victims share traits?"

People care about you. As far as God you probably need to separate the feelings you had in psychosis from the connection you have now. Some of us thought we were speaking with God directly but that may have been a hallucination, or you never know it could have been real. Thing is most people have to see God in life rather than communicate directly. So enjoying the taste of a fresh fruit and knowing everything that had to happen from seed to store to get you something that no human can create, sure we can cultivate but not make. Enjoying the wind on a fall day knowing No human controls that wind. Knowing how extremely rare life is in the universe and how extremely lucky we were to ever have a chance at at.

175881830,"So I have re-read the section on ostentation in my book of diseases of the heart, and clarified the situation for me. We always do something for the observer, there is only one observer, ourselves. Ostentation is doing something for the sake of notoriety. This is different from making oneself known to the observer through presentation, it is seeking a reaction from the form. We are always being observed, but sometimes we doubt this, because we are only aware of partial sight, and we conclude that we are only aware of the observer in a limited sense. By making one’s intentions known more explicitly we convince ourselves that we are being observed and renew our faith in this which gives us purpose. Ideally, one should always have such faith, knowing that we ourselves are observing ourselves at all times. We should be self-contained. But expressing ourselves is not necessarily ostentation, if the desire is simply to be convinced that we are being observed. The point, however, is that we should not n
eed to do this, we should know in our hearts that we are being observed at all times and this should be motivation enough. This is why I refer to self-discipline in the title. Thank you."

175881841,"Electronics Main article: Semiconductor device fabrication Silicon wafer with mirror finish Most elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy, and only approximately 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3–1.5 million metric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity. [64] This typically is the “nine-9” or 99.9999999% purity, [65] nearly defect-free single crystalline material. [66] Monocrystalline silicon of such purity is usually produced by the _PERSON_ process , is used to produce silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry , in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. [67] Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor , which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon’s electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivi
ty (i.e., too high a resistivity ) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge ( positive or negative ) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors , solar cells , semiconductor detectors , and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications. [68] In silicon photonics , silicon may be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light. [69] In common integrated circuits , a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide , an insulator that is easily produced on Si surfaces by processes of thermal oxidation or local oxidation (LOCOS) , which involve exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditio
ns that can be predicted by the Deal_PERSON_ model . Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown (an electron avalanche is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over germanium (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques. [70] Monocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production o
f low-cost, large-area electronics in applications such as liquid crystal displays and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film solar cells . Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.

Usually I strip down my communication to be as shallow as possible for being compatible ...) The aspect of being bored, ran out of challenges after all these years, is probably very important here for me. Thanks for pointing me on that. I wouldn't be naive as founder, also thanks for challenging this, important point. I successfully created a startup as employee before (""Intrapreneur"") and know all the tools, incl. several ways for validating early business hypothesis by customer research. So no danger here, thanks agin, good point to think about. When I reflect on your post I feel that I like business-challenges more than coding-challenges. I also have already proven that I can do good business decisions, one of my business models worked out. The thing is, good deciding alone is worth nothing. Business people don‘t take me for serious. I lack 
the loud way of talking, the ""loud"" way of sitting/walking/standing, the ignorant way of neglecting failure, I even avoid looking into faces (a bit, not entirely) etc. I seriously thought about taking actor's lessons. So I can learn how to appear like a manager ... Well, there might one way out: I could start small and make myself independent from venture capital and blown up managers by choosing a niche business model in which mostly the customer satisfaction defines my success. Then I wouldn't need actor's lessons or worry about being rejected and cut off capital supply because of my schizoid nature. Like selling very special electronic devices in low volumes to customers who really love this devices. (Electr. devices is what I know most about). Also this way I can start small, keep my main income stream up and running in parallel, so the family is save. So this way I would avoid a management position (see thread title ...) and I would still be able to play business challenges. Thanks a lot again."

175881880,"Health store Melatonin would not put me to sleep, either, if that's all I was taking. For Melatonin (or any other health food) to put me to sleep, I have to already be taking, in my case for my bipolar, something like Lithium and an anti-depressant like the one I'm taking, Mirtazapine. Seroquel, I think we decided, was an anti-psychotic. Now, for you to take 600 mg of Lilthium stabilizer and an anti-psychotic would for me be a stretch. It's like an either/or situation. It's like 2 strong medicines, when you only need like one of those. It's like they're repetitive. Like mentioned in above post, both help with the mania and the depression. But yet you want to take both. Oh, my. But the seroquel only for sleep. Oh, no. What would be wrong with a sleeping pill for sleep, and 600 mg of Lithium for mania and depression? With the Lithium, you might be able to go to sleep with the Melatonin. Have you ever tried it? I take about 2 or 3 Melatonin (along with the Lithium and Mirtazapine), and then if I wake 
back up around 4 in the a.m. and realize I'm not going back to sleep, I can take another Melatonin or two. Even if you miss a few hours of sleep one night, you'll still have that information. Or, you can take a doctor's sleeping pill. Maybe have that script from your doctor in case you want to try that in-between appointments. Again, Lithium and Seroquel are repeatitive, they both help with mania and depression. I say, take 600 mg of Lithium for the mania and the depression, and either Melatonin or a sleeping pill for sleep. But since you say you can't go to sleep with Melatonin, I would say the sleeping pill for sleep."

UGH. No help there. Called my pharmacy to see if they got any in their shipment today. The pharmacist was like, I already explained this to you. I was like instantly angry when she said that because she is acting like I am stupid or something. They told me to call today to see if they got it in. They even told me the time to call. The pharmacist is acting like they won't have it in by next week when I'm going to need it again. Somehow she has magically come up with 10 30mg pills. I take 60 mgs. But that would be 5 days worth. Although at this point I would just take 30 mg a day and spread it out. A little better than nothing. But there's another patient she says that takes Vyvanse too so she can't guarantee she'll have the 5 days worth. She's upset because my doctor won't answer the phone. I'm like, yeah, his rece

174325024,"Hello all, I had a psychotic episode in mid 2018 and since then I’ve been well (without any symptoms) and was on olanzapine (10mg then 5mg). Initially they told me it was affective psychosis but later have stated it as a diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I do not believe I have SZ but that is for another argument. I stopped taking olanzapine 5mg about 5 months ago. I’ve been attending University and studying hard. Since mid March and with lockdown I’ve been non stop doing assignments and then had a number of online exams which I finished about 2 weeks ago now. My routine has been pretty much studying 11am to 10pm mon to sun, with lunch breaks and dinner and some relaxation around 10 and after, and exercise wise I would just go for a walk around my area about twice a week. I usually was going to bed around 2am or later and falling asleep no problem. As soon as I finished exams 2 weeks ago I’ve had free time. I tend to get excited/enthusiastic about things when this happens as I’ve been looking f
orward to having my life back. At times in the early morning around 3am I plan out conversations and various ideas (social media, messages etc) and its sometimes hard to sleep but I eventually do fall asleep. Anyways back to my issue, so since stopping exams and having free time just enjoying myself I’ve noticed something happening when I put my head down to sleep at night. I sleep on my side and I’ve noticed that sometimes in my left ear, there’s a mild sensation I can’t really describe, it’s kind of like blood is rushing to that side of my head/ear. As well as that then and worringly, I start to hear noise, I do NOT hear actual words but to me it sounds like a mild whispering from a few sources or a sort of ringing noise ? I cannot make out any language or words but it’s a very fast sort of noise. It doesn’t appear to be coming from any area of my room, it seems to be from my head and it’s kind of at a distance of maybe 10cm in closeness (if even). When I move my head so my left ear is on my 
pillow it stops. Also I feel that if it starts and I don’t move and just stay still it gets louder maybe ? I’m not frightened by it and I would say my mental health/mood is certainly normal at the moment - I’m getting on fine with day to day activities. My Dad has tinnitus for years, perhaps that is the cause? I’d love to know if anyone’s auditory hallucinations ever began like that. Major disclaimer also: I never experienced auditory hallucinations during my first and only episode back in 2018. Thanks for reading this long post! All thoughts and opinions will be greatly appreciated."

174325033,"I never heard of most these diagnosis’s that people on here have. I never heard of 90% of them when I was going through my illness in the 80’s, 90’s and 2000’s. In my day, you were a catatonic, paranoid or hebephrenic schizophrenic. Plain and simple. Times were so much simpler then."
175881963,I will back off if it’s too much. I never want to be hospitalized again.
175881964,"Interesting but to me brevity has some appeal at times. I can remember when people first started using the full stop I like that. And with reverse psychology something our maker did to us, appearing like you care( less) could spark more communication."
175881965,I found that I broke down what society had made me into and found who I truly was after that same kind of experience. You may just be discovering who you really are.
175881966,ok. I’m not watching or making those videos.

175881970,Thanks. I’m trying.
175881971,Hey happy _NAME_’s Day
175881972,Do you have some friends or supportive people to talk to?

175881977,Really that cant be good I hope that isnt the case for me
174325041,i Removed my post bc I just read _AT_MENTION_ ‘s post.
174325044,"I thought then that Call of Duty is a troubling area in some study, that it lowers gray matter. There could be other games, even like “Atari” style games that are better for gray matter, yet still succeed in group play presentation."

175881980,I don’t feel good physically
174325042,When I went psychotic it was out of the blue. But I was getting worse and worse inch by inch year by year before that. I just thought the world was becoming crazier. I had no insight. Then one day my brain just imploded suddenly.
175881981,Can your doctor call in a prn for anxiety until you can get to your appointment?
175881982,_NAME_ I sigh when I see. I love him. My dog the bossy boots. There is so many I am a fan of . I was almost a regular patron to morgue but can’t afford it and don’t agree with him always and on his chat no one said hi to me and I am not Christian but am involved with Christian people and organisations I love and I don’t promote psychedelics but I watch him sometimes. I don’t think chelcie _NAME_ is that funny so that I laugh but I adore her.she is beautiful and my girl crush I just love her n may buy her calendar with almost naked pictures.i love her so much. Loved ones that are dead. When I email my x boyfriend in sa I end by signing /your fan and I would be his patron but I give him a gift sometimes like I bought him coffee for Christmas gift and it was special coffee and I would give him just about all I got I reckon.hold him so high.he is the person I love most then my former stepmother I reckon. I love watching video clips of _NAME_ he has made me laugh out loud.i also love video clips 
of _PERSON_ I get on Facebook it’s not like I listen to her music only or even a lot but I digg her style n she is beautiful and carries herself rather gracefully in a way I think. I definitely idolised my former stepmother when I was a young child and when my mum took me to Sweden I can’t describe how I missed her because I never felt that loved and understood by my mum who I idolised too but differently. I still idolise my former stepmother but not like when I was a young child. She helped me with homework then and now she shows me how to drive places. I love her so much n she is my favourite too. She is gentle with me and only encourages and supports. Doesn’t constantly criticise.she works very hard and is very caring. I really admire and love her. My mum should not be jealous because she’s the one I call mum and she is a individual but I thought she always put her men before me and didn’t love me as much as I wanted her too and there was abuse involved by her and my former stepdad and I forgive 
them but it hurt and affects how I feel.
175881984,america is the bacon on the world’s cheeseburger haha.
175881985,Sry to hear abt ur eating problems. Are choking and cheek biting related? I bite the inside of my cheeks too
175881986,Thought someone did some kind of black magic on me during my first episode… thought I was psychic and a light worker etc. And that numbers were secret messages… I know better now.
175881987,"ScienceDaily How relapse happens: Opiates reduce the brain's ability to form, maintain... Exposure to heroin sharply reduces levels of the protein necessary for developing and maintaining the brain's synapses, a preclinical study has found. The researchers found that the reduction in drebrin levels is regulated by changes in how an enzyme called HDAC2 facilitates access to the DNA. In addition, the study demonstrates that these changes occur exclusively in a specific type of cell within the nucleus accumbens, known as D1, which contains medium spiny neurons, the type of cells that make up this part of the reward center. “Restoring drebrin back to normal levels in these specific brain cells was sufficient to reduce relapse behaviors,” said _PERSON_. The research provides a critical and understudied insight into the mechanisms behind addiction and relapse behaviors, which in combination with future studies may lead to a novel and effective treatment to prevent relapse."
175881988,YES!!!!!!!! I vacuumed. omg I had been putting that off for weeks. But I'm feeling more motivated now.
175881989,I'm proud of myself. I called the nurses line to let them know my doctor sent out the wrong dose of topamax. It was supposed to be started at 25mg for 7 days then 50mg after that. She had sent out 50mg tablets and they didn't look like they can be broken and I don't have a pill cutter. So I let them know and hopefully they can get that resolved
175881990,"This is very true, but we’re not yet at a stage where the nuclear option would get implemented"
175881991,"I forget, but it means ‘As Needed’."
174325046,Look at mister _PERSON_ he was talking word salad from quitting his medicine. My friend went from olanzapine to quitting and ended up needing clozapine and ect to stabilise but the choice is yours

175881995,"Eating at a restaurant on the water in Oakland was really nice, that happened several months ago. I have a pretty good memory of my second plane trip to CA, it was peaceful the whole ride except for a 5 minute voices episode. I loved looking out the window and felt like I had a purpose at least for the day. You know _USER_ID_ Pig recently did a movie based on the Chinese New Year, I kinda got into the show (I know, I’m an adult, it’s a little weird) and am looking forward to watching it in English. The timing is convenient because I believe it is the year of the pig."
175881996,Because of this. It isn’t a personality disorder. It’s just self-expression.
174325045,_AT_MENTION_ how did it go with ur doctor change? Are ur meds in better amount?
175881997,"I know. I’m pretty unstable and can’t stop my bad habits, like smoking."

174325049,Its actually both a stimulant and depressant lol.
175881999,"I feel completely normal most of the time. My problem is that I feel crippled around people because of my social anxiety problems. I think I know what you mean though, I have had days of clarity where I was just chatty like anybody else and felt relaxed around other people."
175882000,I don’t know what you mean? I have laugh a lot by myself or with people but I don’t think laughing is hurting anyone?! Please explain?!
175882001,"I contacted the FBI by email on their website. They didn’t reply. So I called 911 many times telling cops my story, once they passed the phone to a paramedic. The second time cops threatened to give me a fine for harrassing them."

175882006,As soon as I find a new one. Tired of her bullshitting me. I’m searching for a therapist that tackles psychotic disorders. So tired of being treated like one of her other mildly neurotic clients. I need to be somewhat understood. I don’t feel comfortable being totally honest with her. She panicked during my last hospitalization. And she’s a psychologist.
175882007,I’m planning to do a whole lot of nothing. Maybe make some tea. Try to take a nap.
175882008,"Hi, I'm so sorry that you are experiencing this. Have you had any blood tests to check for infection? High eosinophils are a maker for inflammation and that's part of the CBC blood test. I had palpitations and insane anxiety and night sweats, and it turned out I had infections in my teeth, (inside split in amalgam filling) and also lyme disease. I remember the anxiety as unbearable and feel great empathy for your situation. The condition of the mind is linked either to your external circumstances, (stress), your genetics, and/or your present body state. Palpitations might suggest you have a physical component to your anxiety. I've become a believer in biomagnetic therapy after years of struggling with terrible results thru western medicine. It helped me greatly. A short explainer on this is here: https://theanderidapractice.co.uk/therapies/biomagnectic-pair-therapy/ Also learning how to muscle test myself has helped me so much. The body has an amazing ability to tell you what you need. I used medit
ation, yoga and exercise to deal with the anxiety, they helped somewhat while it was happening. I'm obviously not a doctor, and I'm just trying to relay what I've learned from long hard experience, please forgive my TMI! I hope you find your way back to peace soon."
175882009,"i’m not breaking the law, if i am eligible then i am perfectly entitled to use it"
175882010,"Hi _PERSON_, Thanks for the reply. Im glad that you get happy when people reach out to you. I think someone just calling to check up on someone means allot. I decided to reach out to her and call. I didn't get ahold of her but I left a message. She called me back later but I missed her call and then I called her back yesterday. She didn't pick up. I haven't recieved a call back yet so I'm gonna give it one more shot then go about my way. If she doesn't pick up then I can only hope she's doing well. This has been an eye opening experience for me and I will continue to learn what I can. I do not want to be unprepared and uneducated the next time I meet someone with SA disorder."
175882011,Mr. _NAME_ was very funny
175882012,"And at the same time, one second later, someone on the TV jerked his head."
175882013,I do not like being pushed towards a sexual relationship I can’t be successful in due to my many shortcomings. I also definitely don’t want children I can’t take care of. But I am reaching an age where children are not necessarily an issue if I dated women my age. So while I am doubtful that I can make a relationship work it would not be a terrible thing to have sex just for fun. But I will accept it if I never do because few women would be into that I imagine.
175882014,HUGS _AT_MENTION_ I hope your pain level goes down. Getting teeth worked on is always hard. HUGS Kit
175882015,Ok. It doesn’t make clear what they are though. So I dunno.

175882021,"there was a tv programme about a person who tried a certain type of mri where they asked him to say a word that evoked the greatest response, he chose his brothers name who had sz, they managed to measure his responses and asked him to try and talk positively about it and it did make a difference."
175882022,I have heard about _NAME_ but I don’t really know what they mean. I don’t play video games
175882023,Sometimes. Not always. Sometimes I’ll wake up with a pain in a part of my head and a headache and I just know they’ve been at it again. Sometimes I’ll see them and sometimes I’ll wake up and feel them. A few times I’ve had blood on my scalp or the back of my neck from where they’ve been cutting me.
175882024,"Well I can barely make it through a week of activity without getting tired, so I don’t feel all that high functioning. I’d want to go back to tutoring 3 days per week. It’s a good job and pays ok, but I get exhausted easily. I never got into coffee. It’s too strong for me. I like the more trendy drinks lol but I do eat healthy like salads, not pizza. You just sound like you have time to see friends and drive your mom around all the time. More than I can do. Some jobs can be fun. Like tutoring used to make me quite happy.

174325048,"If true, ive been to billions or even trillions of parallel universes. Like simulations too. Outside too. Ive been stuck in approximately 2013 (apparently). Keep coming back alive at 22 with the same psychosis, same historical past with false memories. Its a time loop but took years to get my memories back and realize I’m immortal, and used to be a computer simulator. Some people may say i was an alien lol. Perhaps… I’m a proud American but don’t think people care much. I believe in government. I used to identify as libertarian but am now republican. Feel like i went through monarch programming millions of times and was in montauk project. It was hell. It happened in college. Thats what changed my life for the worse. No proof obviously or evidence. Aliens must be in charge… Feel like i was in ssp and super soldier in a past life. Things like nanotechnology and augmented armor, intelligence, and psychic powers lol. Things like consciousness transfer and upload, and immortality except time 
resets back to 2012 for me. It sucks. Only been cured of schizophrenia 2-4 times. I have stress and ptsd, undiagnosed. Probably had bipolar type 2 before 2012. People thought i had money in a past life. But i don’t. We are middle class or were. My parents work minimum wage jobs. Thats the truth. Dont relate to most folks. Just schizophrenics and truthseers lol."
175882037,Eating bananas with the peel still on them lmao are you crazy lol
175882038,Told me that geniuses become schizophrenics. That’s just an excuse to make schizophrenics feel good. I don’t believe it
175882039,Viable? Yes. Recommended? Even more so!
175882040,"Do what my therapist wants. She wants me to write down the beginning of when I was held by men for 3 months back when I was 19. Eventually, I’m supposed to have written the whole story. She wants me to read it to her and discuss it. I’m not sure I can"
175882041,It’s very possible that you didn’t have insight and do have it now due to hindsight

174325066,Yes a lot of us smoke. I smoke a pack a day and am trying to cut down. I used to smoke on and off through my twenties but never more than 10 cigs a day until I got schizophrenia and started getting really stressed. I don’t enjoy my cigarettes like I used to.
175882050,So I was a waitress in a college dining hall and a friend of mine asked me for an extra desert. The boss didn’t have enough deserts to go around that night but I got my friend the extra desert anyway. The boss saw me and was justifiably angry and said she had fired girls for doing less than that. I was that insecure that I’d risk my job in an effort to keep a friend. No wonder I fail in this world.

175882060,"I know this is an old thread, but I am responding because someone might still be interested in the topic. I do know of one anxiety-focused chat room that is often pretty busy, with people from US/Canada, UK, Europe, Oz and some other places. The discussion tends to get off-topic frequently. But if you want to discuss anxiety, there are usually people there willing to chat and try to be helpful and supportive. I am not certain whether I am permitted to identify that site here, but if _PERSON_ or _PERSON_Cat tells me it is OK, I will do so. (It is not my personal site -- I have no involvement in it at all, other than I came across it and have participated in the chat). I find the chat helpful. Its not like I have gotten any great insights or advice there, but it takes my mind off my anxiety and I have met some interesting people. However, I am signing on to it less often these days because I am trying to reduce the total number of hours per week that I devote to anything anxiety-related -- per my the

I try to be an evangelical now, but I’m a mild religious guy. I have so many it borderlines crazy. Even a schizophrenic would have a hard time believing. So many… A funny one is I thought the catholic church or Vatican hated me for talking and discovering simulation theory, which changed the world and peoples beliefs and sanity. A lot like Socrates, copernicus, and _PERSON_. That was a long time ago. I tried being catholic a few times, but was forced and made to be a evangelical and conservative with traditional cultural values by many forces and beings. I think I’m psychic. I seriously think I can see and predict the future wth high accuracy. I can prove it too, but i get scared. A lot of it has to do with world events and technological breakthroughs. Maybe ill show or prove it someday. My biggest interest, desire, and focus in life 
is to make money."

175882084,I don’t know about that. If someone goes into psychosis even in the countryside their family or friends will recognize that they need professional help and will at least have to get in touch with their doctor to help and then the person will be diagnosed.

You know how much life can improve with treatment, and it is natural to want to share that possibility with him. But, ultimately, the system is set up in such a way that he has to actually want and accept the help, or else become dangerously violent. Something my grandma says about my very ill sz brother is, “We can’t make people’s decisions for them.” It hurts to watch someone suffer when you know what can help. But it is his choice if he would rather drink alone and hallucinate his exes than go to the hospital."

The first couple times I went on antibiotics it helped, the third time they did nothing. The doctors tell me it is probably not a UTI and that that bacteria is just on lady parts but I have found research indicating that it can and does cause UTI’s and why would antibiotics have helped the first couple of times otherwise? And there is literally no other reason I can think of why it would be so bad all of a sudden. Tomorrow I think I’m going to call my urologist and ask to be put on antibiotics again just to exhaust all my options. I really can’t take this I’ve been fantasizing about having my bladder removed. The intrusive thoughts have only just started up recently so I haven’t had a chance to talk to doctor yet. I really have no idea where they came from. I am not suicidal at all.

175882105,"So im a new member looking for advice and support. Figured it couldn't hurt to give this a try. I dont want to start off with an entire life story/medical history so ill try to keep it short and sweet. I suffer from C-PTSD with DID and manic episodes, ADD, anxiety disorder, severe depression, panic attack disorder and etc. I was doing so good until a trigger reared its ugly head along with the pandemic hitting, me quitting a job I loved bc of my parents health, having to go back to work now at a clinic I hate, all while trying to maintain a relationship. I hadn't had any major issues in quit awhile. It had been yrs since id had severe anxiety issues. Now im suffering from severe anxiety everyday. Im extremely depressed and my DID is trying to take over. When it gets to rough I feel myself slipping away. Its hard bc part of me wants to give in and feel nothing but a larger part knows I need my emotions. _PERSON_ tried soooo many meds over all the years. Im currently on 300mg Effexor which has worked 
wonders for me, seroquel to sleep and they just added propranolol to help with my anxiety and nightmares. It does seem to be helping with the nightmares but the anxiety I about cant take anymore. It is truly becoming debilitating. I have so many emotions just engulfing me right now and I feel like I am going to drown any day now. I guess im looking for advice. Maybe recommendations on things that have helped others with their anxiety. Maybe find someone who has struggled with some of this that may have some advice on all areas of life. Ive never really had support. My Psychiatrist understands from education but shes never lived with it. So any advice and recommendations would be greatly appreciated"

175882110,"First post. Recently, I had FEP after a weeks-long marijuana concentrate binge and a general adulthood of usage. General ER administered Ativan which helped me sleep there and I was discharged with clanazepam rx which I have had before. I was considered too self aware for admittance which I suppose is a good thing. Saw my psych 3 days later, took Seroquel 50mg to 100mg for 2 weeks with every extra-pyramidal side effect present which I attribute to my rapidly detoxing state since I dropped marijuana, caffeine and nicotine cold turkey after episode. She also rx’d more clonazepam prn. I felt 100% free of psychosis but the severe side effects caused me to ditch Seroquel. I have been feeling overall pretty stable for the week and a half since then except of course with extreme insomnia and general anxiety that my life is 100% different now. I have some soft signs that are “manageable” for the time without meds. I am still undiagnosed but I feel I know. I mean hopefully I am wrong! I developed a ph
obia of pills after the Seroquel side effects. I feel even the last time I took a quarter of a Kpin I experienced twitching eyelids which I am unsure if it was Seroquel detox or the Kpin itself. I have never had a bad experience with _PERSON_ before the AP. I feel the AP really altered things as I was twitching for a 1.5 weeks after last dose. Finally today the twitching stopped 100% and my jaw un-clenched 100%. I decided to try melatonin to help with sleep, despite my fears of anything psychoactive at this point. Well, once I could feel the effects I felt I was stuck in the phase between awake and sleep where my soft signs are the worst. Usually I start browsing the internet or watching Netflix to avoid the issue till I pass out from brute force sleepiness, but not now. I am lingering where it is the worst because of the melatonin. I am waiting out the general elimination time of 5 hours, about 3 hours in. I have a phobia of night time also now. Once it is around 7 pm my anxiety heightens as for me everythin
g is worse at night and seems almost completely regressed by midday. I was feeling so normal just 3.5 hours ago! If I only slept and hour but felt that normal it would be OK compared to this. I feel I took 3 steps back. My calves started twitching again but luckily they stopped. I cannot deal with that involuntary feeling, really it seems worse than anything going on in my head. Which scares me for what I may encounter in the future… I may need a quarter of clonazepam tonight which frightens me since I just got over any and all detox twitching earlier today. All the anxiety surrounding everything has caused me to start constantly putting my hand to my lips in a nervous way which is a new general annoying thing, and rubbing my hand over my shaved head stubble. I usually write long posts, so thanks for reading. Please feel free to comment and share anything you’d like. Nice to meet you all."

My weight has gone down even though I have been eating too much lately, because I have been drinking a lot of green tea, and that makes me urinate a lot. When you’re dehydrated your body usually re-establishes its previous balance pretty quickly. You crave liquids."

That was a year and a half ago and I think I’ve made like 3 or 4 good friends here, well at least as much as you can be friends with someone you know on a forum. I don’t think anybody is trying to ignore you, people are just more comfortable around people they know and a lot of users have been here for like four or more years. I wouldn’t be able to survive without this forum, it keeps me going and feeling positive. I don’t talk about my delusions because they are all from 4+ years ago and my method of avoiding heartache is to just forget about the past. If you ever want to know I could gladly spill the beans, biggest detail being that I ended up in jail where I was put in 2
4/7 solitary confinement for 5 months and not given any of my medications. I don’t dwell on that though. Sorry, I’m rambling, but it would be great if you stuck around.

I didn't have the best T appointment on Friday. I don't really feel like she took the suicidal thoughts seriously that I was having Tuesday and Wednesday. She did do a risk assessment but she didn't seem to think I was all that suicidal when in reality I was. I got my new glasses this weekend though. I'm trying to get used to them. The past two days they have given me headaches. I can definitely tell that things are less blurry though. So I just have to keep wearing them, keep at it and just wear them. HUGS to all, _PERSON_"
175882168,"So still feeling unsettled doing nothing, thinking about my dream of owning a TARDIS. I am literally thinking about what I would need to do to acquire one, whether I could earn enough to buy one, or build one myself. The problem is easily stated, how do I get a TARDIS, but difficult to break down into individual tasks that lead to the solution. All the steps I can think of seem to require enormous amounts of effort and not get me to the required solution in any reasonable length of time. I should perhaps start with a less ambitious aim of getting a car. I have my first vehicle other than my body already, my foot scooter, and I need to practice using it. I’m still not very good, and have only really been out on it thrice (couldn’t resist using that word as I read an article that it has fallen into disuse). The problem with getting a car is that I would have to change the way I relate to the system, and it is not clear to me in what way that change would have to take place. Universal Basic Income 
remains my preferred change, freeing me up to earn money how I choose, whilst covering the essentials. Once I had proved I could do that I would be in a much better position to get the necessary psychiatrist approval for me trying to obtain a driving licence. Then of course I would have to actually buy or make a car or be given one as a gift. I still dream of practicing medicine of some form, and at the back of my mind is still the idea of becoming an ambulance driver. I’d probably have to start as a taxi driver though. I can’t see any practical steps I can take to get nearer to any of these aims, other than reading more medical theory and improving the functioning of my main vehicle, my body. Thank you."

175882177,"I'm a 52 yr old man who has been diagnosed and experiencing depression and anxiety for over 10 yrs. With the growing and continued violent ""protests"" in my area on top of the COVID-19 situation (fortunately I am an essential truck driver - so still fully employed), my anxieties and depression have doubled. This past weekend hit me the hardest because for the third non-stop week in a row, the violence against the police in my area (many who are family and friends) has increased. The biggest trigger for my near meltdown was when a City Official ""condemned"" the actions of Police who are using the restricted (because the same City Officials have ""regulated"" Police actions) practices against the antagonists that are using those same techniques (except their ""flashbangs"" are homemade) against the Officers. The Local and National Media have repeatedly reported their ONE-SIDED Opinion from the Protestors side of the lines and refuse to even mention, let alone report from behind the Police Officer's 
side. (I WILL NOT entertain ANY Dialog regarding these facts). I know I am not the only person experiencing these anxieties and depressive fears. With my work/driving schedule keeping me on the road for 5-6 days, I end up being so mentally exhausted that I can't even make myself get outside and go on a mountain hiking & camping trip.

175882197,"Naltrexone is a drug for alcoholics and opiate addicts. However the mental mental health patients only use about a tenth of a standard dose eg 4.5 mg instead of 50 mg. I am a physician (MD) in Ireland and my patients have been adding one LDN in addition to standard drugs. . One lady, 20 years doing little, after 3 years in college has got a degree and has a job. It is the first case I have seen in 20 years but it has brought joy to me as to her.It takes weeks to start to work but it is worth trying it. My aim is to reduce admisision to hospital and have a decent life.I have far less people in hospital in recent years.I often compare mental illness to one person is an inch above the water and the other person is an inch under the water. The LDN gets it above right. Ask your doctor before you do any change. Best wishes from Dublin. _NAME_"

Well I got picked up while hitch hiking and invited to a sweat where all the kids came running to the vehicle…There were a lot of other weird things that happened. I can’t explain all of it away. Although, not all my predictions have been accurate…I was suppose to die before the age of thirty, that didn’t happen but I came close.

175882212,I have a water drinking app that says I need at least 8 large cups of water a day. What you drink actually sounds healthy to me and might be good for your body.
175882213,Routine is my savior _AT_MENTION_. Even if I’m feeling like shite I just get into it and do it. Took me a lot of building but it works for me. Good luck. Exercise is so good and I wish I was more gung ho when I was 30. Doh!

It doesn’t mean I necessarily agree with that person but it’s not something to launch a verbal attack over. The ‘ASD/SZ etc are the next stage in human evolution’ types are the ones I have less time for. That goes way beyond seeing yourself as ‘non-disabled’ ."

175882217,"So I’m not intellectually masturbating, at least I don’t think so, I’m using my ego to do things that are beneficial for taking care of myself and others. I am trying to learn to care for a bonsai tree to learn how to be in harmony with the four seasons. Ideally one would be able to be in harmony with all nature, but I am starting with a small tree from outer space, it is bone dry but I’m sure it lives. This week I spent a fortune on plant medicine and food for it in an attempt to get it to leave again. I’m probably doing more harm than good, but some of the things I bought for it really worked. As I said at the beginning, please don’t confuse this with some sort of flippant lifestyle, timing is important, and learning to doctor plants is as important as letting them be. Thank you."

175882232,Hi there. I’m so sorry the medications weren’t helping and that you’re having bad withdrawal symptoms. I’ve stopped meds cold turkey before and the same thing happened. I know at least for Mental Health of America’s online screenings they say it’s not a diagnosis but just to give you an idea and that you should talk to a professional. I would talk to a trusted counselor or psychiatrist if you can. Especially since you might want to find medications that work better for you and a counselor could help you process what triggered your possible PTSD. I hope you can get the help that you need!

175882249,"Mental diseases create gradual damage to brain cells which is likely permanent. If our brain get damaged by some injury, stroke etc its very unlike that part get healed instead that part function is allocated to other part or cells in brain to continue and that occur by rehabilitation training, habits etc. Same way we need to create habits, schedules etc so our brain can allocate damaged region function to other parts. For example in OCD. Its not possible to stop obsession as the brain’s filter is already damaged and how to cope is by adding a pause and redirect our attention away from that distraction and move on. Reassure the mind that that obsession is due to the damage in brain and acknowledge it and refuse to go along with obsession or compulsion. This is principle behind CBT, ERP for managing OCD."

175882274,"This is very encouraging. I remember reading about this drug years ago and then … nothing. Like no development. It had sounded really promising and I had wondered why they seemingly abandoned it. Glad to see they did not. The PANSS total score was reduced by 20 points, a statistically significant treatment difference from the placebo. Brilaroxazine also mitigated positive symptoms and negative symptoms, and improved social functioning and cognition. Importantly, the FDA has agreed to consider a potential ‘Superior Safety’ label claim, if there is a positive outcome on a relevant endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study in schizophrenia. The average reduction in PANSS from placebo is pretty similar to other atypical antipsychotics. It’s the other parts - better safety, side effects profile, improved cognition and social functioning that make it interesting."

175882311,"You should make it so you can instantly delete your account. I feel this would add to transparency as social media is often addictive and adds to depression for people. For instance, I had to delete facebook and it takes a month for them to actually delete the account. So if your account was hacked oh well. so if you have security concerns oh well. same with banks. I hate the whole system and there’s no accountability for providers online. They don’t help. I just gave up trying to delete my social media. It’s not like ANY OF that information is ever deleted. It’s all stored by your internet provider and all these random databases etc. only hackers and trolls get away with anything and the people who are tracked by advertisements are tired of this system. Can you delete my account too?"

175882316,My mom for about 2 years has been having very strong nightmares this past year it has become a nightly thing. Sometimes she sleeps in my room to give my aunt a break who she shares a room with from waking her up in the middle of the night from her yelling. It’s extremely scary and tonight she tried sleeping in my room but she scared me twice at one point into a paranoid episode. I unfortunately had to kick her out because I was scared it was going to trigger me into psychosis… unfortunately now I can’t sleep. I would really like to help my mom and I also believe she has bad anxiety but she doesn’t want to seek help. I just don’t wanted her to have a stroke in her sleep because of her nightmares.

174325106,Amyloban 3399 is how I went from 80mg/day of Geodon down to 10mg/day. An unexpected benefit was that it helps with pain from severe nerve damage. I used to have an open-ended Vicodin scrip that I was happily able to let go of. My pdoc is now recommending it to others with close to a 50% success rate of reducing their positive symptoms. I also use Sarcosine and have noticed it gives me a very mild cognitive boost. I’m mentally draggy when I run out of it so I try to make sure I’ve got extra packs on hand.

174325112,"The investigators hypothesize that NAC will inhibit KAT II, which will be reflected in the: 1) decreased peripheral conversion of kynurenine to KYNA; and 2) increased CBF, glutamate, and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA). In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the NAC effects on the neuroimaging measures will be related to improved performance on cognitive measures of attention, verbal and visual memory and working memory. These observed effects of NAC will be greater than those seen with placebo. The investigators further hypothesize that the NAC effects on ASL CBF, glutamate, and FA measures will be independent of NAC-induced changes in MRS glutathione, i.e., not due to the NAC oxidative stress mechanism, but, rather, will be correlated with NAC-induced reductions in the peripheral conversion of kynurenine to KYNA. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that the observed effects of NAC on CBF, glutamate, and FA will be related to baseline serum KMO activity and KYNA levels. The dem
onstration that NAC reverses the adverse impact of increased KYNA levels will importantly support the development of KAT II inhibitors for the enhancement of cognition in schizophrenia. This is a trial, they don’t have results yet, in fact, they’re not expected to have results until 2024. But KYNA inhibition is one of the areas I’m particularly interested in."

175882352,"One thing I practice to help keep my thoughts and fears in check -- I only do about 15-20 minutes of news a day, usually in the morning. Then I do other things all day. If I think of it I might do another 15-20 minutes in the evening, but often I find I'm busy with something else and I don't think about checking it a second time. During the day I just do whatever precautions I need to, but don't let myself actually think about it too much. I fill my mind with other things - chores, books, movies, music, poetry, gardening, whatever your hobby or activity is that keeps you busy and focused. Someone told me a long time ago, in respect to grieving a great loss -- allow yourself to get totally into it; crying, yelling, whatever, for 10-15 minutes a day. Then set it aside and go about living. I've adopted this way of dealing with whatever is causing me great stress -- it really helps! Best wishes."

I’ve been on 2.5mg for five days and noticed I’m eating and smoking a bit less. Libido still the same. Do you think the 0.5mg decrease will make a difference to my side effects?

175882388,"Perhaps my feedback will help. Schizoid Personality Disorder is just further along on the ""avoidance scale"" than Reactive Attachment Disorder (Avoidant). By the way, some call this ""combination"" (not really a combination unless you consider it a one-two punch) ""pseudo-psychopathy."" I thought for a long time I was a psychopath, but I didn't have the charm and instead avoided people and relationships. I was adopted, and the institution I was adopted from had a policy that they hold onto the infant for three months in foster care in case the birth mother wanted the baby back. Add to that I got adopted into a household with a Borderline Personality primary care mother. Luckily, instead of developing BPD, I had a genetic predisposition toward Schizoidism. Let's just say I didn't score any points with my primary caregiver over that one. First, she admitted she subjected me to ""aggressive tickling."" Second, I think she would asphyxiate her three adopted children in an attempt to silence their unbe
arable (to her) crying. Third, growing up I assumed the role of ""spoiler,"" meaning I was the bad child anyway, so I attracted her ""emotion fire"" to shelter the younger children from emotional and verbal abuse. Of course, as is typical in situations like that, I was actually blamed by the younger children for my ill-treatment. One other thing: it is said that having RAD lands most men in jail (women not so much), especially if they progress to BPD (which is the most common personality disorder RAD progresses to). I am lucky I instead progressed to SPD. Frankly, it is the only personality disorder in Cluster C (Odd & Peculiar) that I believe is somewhat beneficial, although it has badly hurt my earning potential over my lifetime."
174325120,"Mental Illness is seen as a dubious reason to claim being disabled because it’s hidden from sight and we don’t have wheel chairs or crutches. Physical disability is bad, but disability of the mind is equally as tragic. Me personally, I do not see myself as disabled as Schizophrenia is just part of who I am. It does put me at a disadvantage, but as long as I take my pills and avoid stressful things I can get by."

175882390,"Yes, and it's my perception as well. The reality of what we are is beyond our comprehension. You can't see reality from inside the box. I also understand why people would want to believe in some comforting idea, which provides them with a level of hope. What I can't understand is how they do it. How do they switch off that voice that says, ""Nah, it just doesn't make sense."" Even in the bible, it says, ""If the dead are not raised, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” The writer described it as a choice. It had nothing to do with compelling belief, just that ""It doesn't matter if it's real or not, you might as well choose to accept this as your belief, otherwise what hope do you have?"" If that's true, the schizoid would represent people who are so switched on to reality that they can't accept stories without substance. To be 'normal', you'd have to be willing to suspend reality for your own sanity. I think, fundamentally, we all know there's ""more"" to what we see, and if you became ob
sessed with it, as people with existential depression likely are, the impossibility of ever knowing an answer would probably cause psychological damage. We've effectively evolved beyond what's good for us. Intelligence makes us more effective, but a by-product of it is that we're aware of our own mortality."

I can’t do anything that might be made fun of, or they’ll seize on it and tear me to shreds. I have to remind myself that these voices are only audible to me, and I still have my privacy. But it’s hard when the voice calls me names and makes fun of, for example, my past embarrassments. They’ll call me a loser because of things I went through in high school, they’ll call me a pervert if I ever engage in anything sexual, and they will comment negatively on everything I do, even when I’m alone. If I ever view anything with sexual situations they will mock me for not having had relations in a long time and make me feel like garbage. It’s different than thinking you have a camera on you, but it still strips away a
ny feeling of privacy. I hope you don’t have to deal with voices, they make the delusions so much worse. Just remember, it’s possible for the delusions to go away if you give it time and continue to take your medication."

175882409,"So as some of you know, I recently got rid of my Pdoc and have been searching for a new one. So anyway I talked to my GP about what I’m searching for and the symptoms I’m wanting to work on. He gives me a referral. That referral called me a few days later (yesterday) and got the ball rolling. My new team will include a new Pdoc, Pnurse, Case manager and Psychologist(if I so choose and want to switch from my current therapist). Northern California has a Huge medical community here, and my insurance was accepted by one of the top contenders in the field. Right now I’m waiting for a few more calls, today or tomorrow. but with some luck I’ll be picking my next Pdoc soon. My medication is well stocked, and I’m not going to mess with it until I talk to a Pdoc. Things are really looking up in the llamas world, as far as his mental health treatment is concerned. I feel more secure, more hope, renewed vigor into my treatment. Big changes in llama treatment, changes I’m hoping for the best."

175882432,"_AT_MENTION_ Ok, I see, non-profit is a difficult setting for cost compensation. Thanks for sharing. By the way, after 20 years of working experience, I finally learned a lesson, that most people know from day 1. But I needed 20 years: (Unless you're an entrepreneur in a start-up) the business result is far less important than my social acceptance in the team. So I changed my priorities, I spend 95% of my energy (not my time, but my energy) for social investment and I don't care at all for the team result. This makes me much more resilient, I never have to argue about anything, and people like me more in job situations. 20 years long I thought things like ""we're all in the same team"", like in soccer everyone's part of a big selfless team, and only by cooperation we can win etc. - all #######4. Only the sharks survive and the honest ones are the stupid ones. It's difficult for me now in my age to convert from a stupid honest person to a shark, I'll never make it.

He has already seen a psychiatrist but he still doesn’t want to take his meds. My friend knows about my mental health problems/diagnosis. I have made progress by taking meds and accepting treatment. He is hopeful that I can somehow get through to his brother and help him. I was just wondering if any of you guys have been put in a similar situation.

175882495,"I was in there 8 months when I was 21. The hospital was built so that there were three nurses stations who were responsible for about two corridors of patients rooms, which was about 8 rooms with four people sharing each room. This was way back in 1982 by the way. I still remember the 3 nurses who were responsible for my section. One was a gorgeous 24 year old blonde who wore lipstick and nice dresses under her nurses smock most of the time, there was one nurse who the other nurses picked on sometimes. She was kind of plain looking but I thought she was OK. The third nurse was a male which surprised me because I don’t think male nurses were as common 40 years ago as today. But he impressed me. I had a bunch of jobs before I got in, I had washed dishes, been a custodian, stocked shelves, worked at gas stations, cleaned carpets etc. But this guy was only twenty years old and I was impressed that he had such a responsible position at his age; a way better job than I ever had. I didn’t like him for 
quite awhile but then after some months passed I thought he was cool. Then one morning after breakfast he said, “How would you like to go somewhere tonight.?” I was surprised but I said sure. So 5:00 pm rolled around and I got dressed and he took me to this Chinese restaurant. He said order anything and I ordered a big plate of food. I wasn’t sure why this was all happening out of the blue. But we ate and talked and a good time. On the drive back to the hospital he explained the whole thing. He said that once a year each nurse takes their favorite patient out to dinner, a one time thing. I was shocked. I never felt well liked and I kept to myself and didn’t talk much in the hospital. But this guy chose me out of 32 people as his favorite patient. I still remember feeling so good about myself that he picked me. It was one of the few rare good things that happened to me in the 8 months I was there."

As a result of these medications, I have since gained over 25 pounds… As time went on, I would eventually reduce the medication enough to drop the Zyprexa, followed by the Seroquel later on, and stayed on Abilify injections plus my Lithium for quite some time. Unfortunately, the Abilify injections were causing sexual problems, which I thought would have regulated by stopping the Zyprexa, along with the Seroquel. It took quite some convincing to get my Pdoc to switch my injection doses back to pill form doses, as I was placed on Inje
ction format previously, as a consequence of stopping my medications in the past. I managed to get my Pdoc to put me back on risperdal, which I had taken in the past with no sexual problems, although this time around, it was bad, as it raised my prolactin levels which lead me to switch to Abilify pill format 15mg daily. Fast forward a couple of months and my prolactin is still elevated, and they found that the Abilify was not lowering the prolactin as it was supposed to do. I was experiencing a rare side effect from the Abilify that was causing my prolactin to stay elevated. I was feeling hopeless at this point, thinking my sexual dysfunction would never truly go away as long as I stayed medication compliant…my Pdoc was pushing me to try Saphris. After trying Seroquel alone after the Abilify, I was totally zombified and wanted off. When going back to the Pdoc soon after, I decided to try the Saphris, largely thinking here I go, trying another AP that will continue to supress my sexual function… and there 
I went, trying Saphris for the first time… Switching to Saphris proved to be the best thing for me in the end. after about a week or so, I immediately noticed more motivation, more energy, and my vision even improved as I experienced blurred vision from the previous antipsychotics including Abilify. I am back in the gym 5 times a week, and I do not feel the need or the desire to take daily naps as I was previously doing. Most importantly, I feel my erections coming back! I feel nice and strong down there again. I went more than a whole year of no erections and I am now finally seeing some real improvement! I am so glad to have made the switch to Saphris. People say it tastes awful, but I do not seem to mind it. I would recommend this medication to anyone looking for a change. It has also been weight neutral for me, I have not seen any weight gain whatsoever on it. Granted, I am taking a low dose. There is hope in taking a medication which does not cause weight gain and/or sexual dysfunction. You just have t
o be patient and perhaps try many different APs before you find the right one, like I have. There are also new advancements being made on APs being made from this point on. Patience is a virtue. Looking forward to better days is what you have to tell yourself. One day, you will get there too."

175882523,When most people are strangers they are indifferent. I am too. I’ve met a few people on my street and they’re very nice. And helpful. One lady told me her husband had a stroke about 11 years ago; he doesn’t work a job but he does handyman stuff. I have a couple doors here that I might have him work on-kind of a nice way to meet neighbors. I’m a very neighborly kind of gal! Nutcase

175882526,When I was in the hospital in 1997 they were giving me pills. I thought they were trying to poison me so I was sticking my finger down my throat to throw them up. They gave me an injection of haldol. They drugged me to the max. Haldol can cause acne. I had bad acne but when they put me on haldol my face exploded. I have a bunch of scars from when I was in the hospital. After the injection I was sleeping 23 hours a day. I couldn’t tie my own shoes I was so out of it. The only reason they still use the stuff is because it’s cheap and effective. It was developed in the 1950’s and one of the first antipsychotics. I hated the stuff. As soon as I got out of the hospital I told my mom I’m stopping it. After about 30 days I started getting paranoid again. My mom found me another doctor and he prescribed Zyprexa. I’ve been on Zyprexa for 22 years. Out of all the meds I’ve tried Zyprexa was the most tolerable. I don’t feel like a zombie on it. I’m on 10 mgs. The only bad thing I have to say is 
I feel like I’m in a fog in the morning when I wake up. I’ve tried several other meds over the years and I always go back to Zyprexa. You might want to consider giving it a try. It took a long time for me to get better on Zyprexa. It was slow progress over a number of years but I no longer hear voices. The last drug I tried was sapheris because I heard it was the latest greatest thing. I tried it for a couple weeks but it was almost as bad as haldol.

175882546,"We have all heard the expression “people pleaser” which is used in a derogatory sense. Why is it derogatory. Because people pleasing is an attempt to hijack other people’s aims, to share what is not yours. If someone’s aim coincides with your own then you can work together to achieve it, co-operate. If someone’s aim differs from your own then you can compete to achieve your aim. But if someone’s aim differs from your own and you try to achieve it for them, that is seeking to achieve an aim that does not belong to you. This is why it is ignoble and is one of the diseases of the heart mentioned in my book. I have often fallen into this trap in the past, I need to be vigilant that I don’t fall into it again. Thank you."

175882570,"Yeah, I basically see stress as my body telling me: “Right now is an emergency!

To realize that you bought a ticket to run from your friend shows that you got insight, which is a very good thing. During a delusion I have little to zero insight. My delusions are sometimes so covincing even my psychiatrist once thought they were real. When I explained to him afterwards what happened, he says that I have insight.

175882611,"I am so blessed and thankful for the relationship I have now. I really really am. That's why I HAD to snatch fiance up. I had to. I recognized something very very special in him that makes me overlook any flaws he has. He said he fell in love with me when he was talking to me about his relationship with his dad and wanted to cry (when he came over once to my dads) and I grabbed his hand and told him that itll be okay. He said he noticed how caring I was. (He says sometimes now that I'm too caring or overcaring lol). Initially fiance and I dated 1 day and then I broke up with him. I wasnt sure if I liked him. I didnt think he was funny, or that cute, but I knew he was very sweet and nice. And then during our breakup I wanted to stay friends. He said sure. He cut his mohawk off during that friendship time (which he never wore up. It looked like a rat tail which is why I didnt find him cute at the time). He must've still liked me because he cut his hair for me because I said one time I didnt like it. 
Lo and behold my view of him changed, visual wise. He looked so cute with his new haircut. I fell head over heels that day he came to my house and showed me his haircut. I immediately snatched him up again. And his humor grew on me fast eventually. Reason I stuck around him and eventually re-snatched him up was because he was so darn kind and sweet, and respectful towards me. And at the beginning he went all out to please me. Buying me things here and there. Like bringing me coffee from starbucks when he came over, or taco bell. And he would bring me little presents from time to time. He would hold me all day and we would talk about life. I knew there was something special about him. And the rest is history. It's been almost 2 years and we are very happy. I have no doubt itll stay that way."

175882635,"I was normally the one that helped out my Sister but it was killing me bc it was going toward her former partners drink/drug habit, he was an ???????, she did give me most of it back though, he left her in a lot of debt at Xmas with 3 kids, The most i ever loaned off of my Mum was the deposit for my first flat which was the first month rent in advance but i gave her it back very quickly, i’d said to the guy i got the let off of that i had plenty of money even though i didn’t, but it was enough to get my foot in the door."
175882636,"It looks better outside now though, people aren't congregating in groups, hanging out like usual or standing around close together. So they seem to be following the distancing thing thankfully."
175882637,"No school, it was university and don’t think that it is a good idea to begin this again. It is impossible for me to communicate with people."
175882638,"We were supposed to have leftover chili for dinner but I fed it to my daughter and her boyfriend. My son decided to run to the store to buy something yummy for dinner and he bought himself a pizza, my ex some special healthy fish dinners that he likes and I got some hamburger meat. I’m going to have a hamburger _USER_ID_. I need beef. lol. What are you having for dinner?"
175882639,Yeah that is a definitely a risk. I will try to forget about it. I don’t religiously look at lunar calendars or anything but I agree it isn’t a healthy situation
175882640,"I disagree with you _AT_MENTION_ . It has nothing to do with brain chemistry in my case( and at least in some if not all the other cases,I believe). What causes intrusive thoughts , delusions, psychosis and irritation in me, is a strong current of negative energy directed against me, and it has nothing to do with dopamine or serotonin."
175882641,Is your dad a religious person? My mother lived and died from type I diabetes and she never thought God was punishing her. Bloody hell. ???? happens. I do know that negative emotions can affect your physical health but they don’t cause MD
175882642,nothing to do on sleepless nights sleep is a good break from reality.
175882643,"The facade of a secret schizoid is more like a coping mechanism -- it's more functional than desperation. Being a secret schizoid means the ability to have a job, a livelihood, and independence to a lot of people. The facade is not a genuine thing. It's not an attempt at having normal relationships. I don't think it would necessarily be an asset in therapy. It could be a barrier pretty easily, if the schizoid doesn't want to drop the facade."
174325178,my case is the same like u. i too suffer from the same negative symptoms. i dont have any advice or tips for u bcoz i myself dont have.
175882644,Do you think that opening early for disabilities includes sz’s?
175882645,God knows a lot of my life is fear based. It seems like I create my own situations that cause me fear. It’s weird. I compulsively engage in nonverbal behavior that sends out false signals that I am morally reprehensible. It fits easily into the definition of obsessive compulsive disorder. I’m impossible to live with because my involuntary behaviors cause major stress in others. I’ve had this problem almost forty years.
175882646,Yes! It would!!!
175882647,It’s best if you can to drink distilled water because it’s pure water. No chemicals.

174325177,Trintellix 5 mg's and Abilify 1 mg. I had minimal to no side effects on the lowest dose of Trintellix 5 mg aside from getting these late morning what felt like med induced depressive lows that would dissipate after a few minutes to a few hours. Over all I was improving in all areas of my mental health! Better mood and less depression. My Psych Dr. decides to add Abilify 1 mg out of fear that I could become unstable on the antidepressant alone (Trintellix). So far I really hadn't. I liked where I was going with the antidepressant alone so far. I was really excited! after a few weeks I felt like I was plateauing on my mood and now feel like I'm a little set back with the depression and irritability. I felt was doing better on the Trintellix alone and believe the abilify maybe creating agitation and hindering my mood. I honestly would like to go back to mono therapy with the antidepressant and up the dose just slightly and get off the abilify. It's only been two months and I know you have to give these 
things time but that's my instinct on the treatment as of now. I follow up with my Dr. next week. Any feedback appreciated. I'll post next week. Thank you.
175882655,10 days till they get back
175882656,IKR. I must find _NAME_.
175882657,"Thanks for your opinion, and sorry you have been through that. I just dont know. It might indeed open up wounds, cause more hurt. But i like to think things can heal, on all sides. The kid being around him is something i indeed worried about. I called child protection before anonymously to inquire what i could do. He is one of the reasons i opened up. I wanted people around him (wife) to at least know and keep an eye on the situation."
175882658,"Yeah, I have the same troubles but probably for a different reason."
175882659,"Friendship has to be cultivated and nurtured. It is work to make and keep friends. True, some friends just seem to hit it off from the start but that’s an extra plus."
175882661,"Yes I feel a machine/computer as well as different energies! This happens day and night for me also. I am very sensitive to other people’s energies too, so it adds another reason to why I isolate myself so much."
175882662,I think that Abilify Maintena is okay
175882663,"You could try Neurofeedback, it’s helped my anhedonia after 10 sessions, and my general boredom after 8. I stayed out of bed half of the day after my first one, and all day after the 2nd."
175882664,"Haldol has been working well for me for over 10 years, but I’m on a low dose of 1mg. The side effects can be nasty at the higher doses. Go as low as you can and it may work well for you."

175882670,"I get catatonia everytime I stop my antipsychotic. Its scary feels like death, I freeze even my eyes dont move, my parents hit me and yell at me to wake me up, they called 911. I only got catatonia once on meds so far but less severe, my body muscles were stiff and my mouth stayed open, couldn’t close it or move for 30min-1h and my brain was tense like a headache, felt like brain freeze when you drink too much ice. I hope that it doesn’t happen again!"
175882671,"This would make the plot of an interesting book, or a movie I think. It sort of reminds me of _PERSON_. Hearing about your situation is very interesting to me, just because I don't seem have these internal representations of people I know, or even myself, but I hear about others having them a lot and sometimes I wonder what the absolute lack of them says about me. Like even first degree relatives -- I never think about them, never make idealized placeholders, and there is nothing there in place of those relationships. I think you are maybe in a better place than I am."
175882672,I mostly get unaddressed advertisments and bank statements for empty bank accounts.

174325187,"I was on Lithium and had toxicity to the point where I had kidney failure and seizures. My levels were 4.6 when I ended up in the ICU for a week when I was 19. Never touching the stuff again, ever. As far as clozaril goes, Idk, I don't think so, I mean I think I'm mostly doing good I just get some days every once in awhile where I feel that way but it's not a constant state or anything like that"
175882677,"I’m sure there are plenty of reasons to not like a foster home. But them being responsible and looking out for you, in the way of making sure you take your meds, shouldn’t be a reason to dislike them. You need meds. Or go to prison for premeditated murder. Seems like an easy choice."

175882679,I am currently getting my master's degree online while all of this madness is happening. I struggle with depression and anxiety and am currently unmedicated for both. I am trying to lose weight but I feel like I can't ever feel good about myself. I am struggling to stay motivated and I feel like my lack of self esteem is affecting my relationships and my ability to trust those who love me. I honestly feel like I don't have control.
175882680,I just got that too. it is preety harsh. it just says don’t go out lol check out bbc news they say criteria for going out _AT_MENTION_
175882681,I take off and on Lyrica it helps me sleep. Otherwise my mind never shuts off.

175882684,"I’ll only perform on an intermediate level, now. No opportunity to keep in shape. And I just call it retirement."
175882685,I never had a social life even before my diagnosis. It all began in my prodromal period in high school when I had zero friends and it continued into college and the rest of my life. I have zero friends to this day. I’m not complaining that’s just the way it’s always been.
175882686,I think it’s a good idea that you go _AT_MENTION_ . It’ll do you good.
175882687,_NAME_ and stuff. I guess weight gain is just as bad or worse.
175882688,"Yeah thankfully. They were a pain for a couple years. I tried Seroquel, Abilify, Zyprexa, Risperdal (in order,) All of those I was still getting annoying loud voices. Doctor made me try Clozaril and it’s been great since. It does happen sometimes stuff like I hear my phone ringing or a notification sound and I go look and realize there was no activity"
175882689,"I miss it. I wish I was back to my young hot self so I could want to want it like I did back then. But I guess I’m better off without it. I wonder if someone could come along to make me feel the way I used to or if I’m just old and washed up forever. So far the only interest I’ve had is toward woman. The relationship I was in before I met my husband was with a woman, but it didn’t work out, and I was talking to another woman when my husband won me over but I always wonder what would have happened if I would have gone the other way. Actually I found out recently that she passed away, sad, sad news, I wonder if things would be different for her too. Oh well, no, no sex. not currently."
175882690,"I've had health anxiety since being diagnosed with prostate cancer 15 years ago. It doesn't go away, but I've learn to live with it and I've learned to do what I can to maintain good health and accept what I can't control. It's a good thing to practice self care when you're trying to help someone else. One thing that has been helpful for me is to avoid criticizing or controlling. Take care and hang in there."

Your job sounds very interesting and rewarding. I’m a nurse, but am between jobs at the moment. I live in Australia and love it."
175882695,"I'm in the middle of Canada. My mom has a first shot, but currently they have it open in general to anyone 50+, or if you're native Canadian it's 30+, and in certain neighborhoods 18+. I don't live in a high risk neighborhood, not Native American, and I'm only 32. So I have to wait until they lower the age, or open up to everyone in my neighborhood. Canada has to rely on the US and other countries for the vaccine so it's being limited for now. They're even extending second dose dates as far back as they can because of supply issues. And now with Ontario having a huge problem with COVID, more resources are going there, than here, but we still have a lot of restrictions including no visiting even standing outside. I got friends who live in high risk neighborhoods, and one is native Canadian so they're all getting their shots next week. Rest of us gotta wait. Including my sister, and she's working the phone lines helping people register to get a shot."
175882696,"You wont know unless you try. Dont let others limit your life and tell you what to do. My psychiatrists all said that I should give up completing my university degree, 5 remaining semesters. Now I have my degree and I had very good grades in some courses. I tried working but it was too much stress and I quit work by myself after up to a month. But on Latuda I was able to work during the 9 months I was on it, it was a low stress accounting job at my mother’s accounting office. The boss is my mother’s friend."
175882697,I’m not a big talker. I think it’s be pretty easy for me. The only problem is I wouldn’t be able to order fast food.

What I was wondering was how many hours could I work if I get a check like that? Does anybody else do this? I’m thinking I can only work 8-9 days off 8 hours a day to get that amount so I would have to stretch it out though the month. Do you think an employer would let me work 4-6 hours a day like 3-4 days a week?"
175882701,Plugged in biofeedback? With the machines and everything? I actually received bio feed back from a doctor and it was basically just a guided meditation. Which was kind of irritating.

175882704,I have to get bloodwork done every week for 6 months
175882705,Sounds expensive. I don’t think I’ll be trying that. I’m hoping my doctor ups my antidepressants. I was on Wellbutrin and had a lot more motivation and focus. I was working out everyday. I had so much energy. But the side effect was I couldn’t sleep. Now I’m on cymbalta and I’m right back to where I started. Don’t really feel like doing anything. The doctor said we could try upping the dose next month. So I’m hoping that makes the difference

174325195,"https://vari.vai.org/hotspot-in-the-genome-may-drive-psychosis-in-schizophrenia-and-bipolar-disorder/ Blockquote The team took a comprehensive, broad look at DNA derived from brain cells of people with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and compared them to healthy controls. Their analyses revealed a cluster of epigenetic marks, which switch genes on and off, in an enhancer at a gene called IGF2 , a critical regulator of synaptic development. Enhancers are stretches of DNA that help activate genes and can be major players in the development of diseases in the brain and other tissues. This enhancer also controls the activity of a nearby gene called tyrosine hydroxylase, which produces an enzyme that keeps dopamine in check. When the enhancer is epigenetically switched on, production of dopamine becomes dysregulated, resulting in too much of the chemical in the brain. Blockquote"

If they are acting like that then play the game and just do what you need to do. Put on a face. Get some real friends. I’m sorry you have to deal with that from family but friends are those you choose yourself to hang around. Plenty of good people out there. Hang in with family. You don’t need to be their best friends.

But I got RXed Capylta lumateperone the new one but the reading with it I can’t take it because I’ve got heart issues, weight gain and diabetes is higher than even zyprexa, so my pdoc said she’d write it but really advised me not to do it. So, my savior drug that all the trials toted as this and that, are lies. And it kills your white blood cells, so she really didn’t want to do it. We instead have doubled my xanax twice a day and she said that my 3 drinks a week are probably better health wise than the lumateperone for me. I’ll post the pharmacy page warning it comes with if anyone wants it. That’s just what Walgreens gave me. _PERSON_ and her nurse looked up government trials and said she’d probably never be able to have faith in the drug because the company release papers don’t give a good picture at all.

175882776,"We are STRONG broadasters. Weve been conditioned to broadcast our thoughts since we wre very young.I bet your parents are religious too. In my case my mother wanted me to strongly read the bible and be good. And said thinsg like: - God is watching u son and so on. When i was a very young kid i was FEARLESS(very manic, happy, and a risk taker), very confident and intelligent for my age. People have always wanted to put me down, and i didnt know why until my so called ""psychosis""( bs term created by the aware ones). So during my psychosis i heard almost all and i mean ALL the voices of ppl ive known from the past. They said thats why people always have tried to put u down, so that you wont get manic(aka ""wild n crazy"") Just watch the ""_NAME_ Show"" intro. EVERYBODY you know are in on it, family, friends, strangers, EVERYBODY! Its completely true. The only thing theyre lying about in the movie is the cameras hidden in every corner, car, etc. Its not cameras! ""Remote viewing"" and all the other t
erms are created by the aware ones. Its not some technology, thats bllsht, they are trying to divert and mislead you by saying its some technology. Telepathy, ""remote viewing and all the other ClAIRES are a natural occurance in nature. Heres the truth: They can hear your thoughts, they can see you live, they can see the mental pictures u see or create in your own mind and they can literally feel your emotions. If you feel very happy f ex you broadcast that energy to all the people except for those who are in our position(those who cant read minds and so on, trumans) We are naturally confident, and have MUCH self love, and posess alot of very good traits most people would like to have, so we stand out from most people when we are young. we are not ordianry nor will we ever be. And now to the topic WHY is this kept a secret and why doesnt they just kill us when were young!? Its because, FIRST of all, you are a family member, and they dont want to F you off because they care for you, its their blood and so on. 
They cant nor u cant help that youve been borned with this ""gift/curse"". SECOND of all since most people if not ALL people in our position are generally sepaking good people, and have mostly good thoughts throughout our lives(prior to the psychosis i mean, nowadays my thoguhts are tripple F'd up, just because i know theyre hearing me all the time, cant help thinking fd up) So for that reason we are an important source of knowledge, and weve shared wisdom throughout our whole lives. During my ""psychosis"" they even telled me exactly that, that weve learned ALOT from you, who we are, how we should think and act and so on. So weve been functioning as a guide to a GREAT majority of ppl. The key word here is MANIA. Since were naturally manic(YES, it is our natural state) from a very young age, theyve made sure that we felt fear from a vey young age aswell. So they tell you scary things and the news is without a question the most influential one. Why all this f'd up news all the time, like why is that? Its becau
se they want you to feel fear, its for us, the trumans. If youre in a state of fear, your also in a state of being more controlled. Most of it is not even true if even anyhting. Do not feel fear. Once again, during my ""psychosis"" i was told that EVRRYTHING is a game. A lot of the time the news are fll of sht that didnt even happen or is being manipulated. Youll never be a victim of terrorism f ex. That will never happen. This society we live in(at least western) is created because of us, BUT to benifit them(the aware ones, family friends etc.) The voices said to me that: -all people care about is money and power) And that obviously true when you observe your surrondings. People like Jesus, _NAME_ D'arc, and many other ""special people"" possesed all these traits im talking about. They where ALL in our position. I dont really know what more to type, but im sure i have missed something out, so ask me anything about this matter and ill try to answer."

175882778,"I viewed a thread from RE: Matters to Consider when Reducing or Coming off Meds: it said ""Potential adverse effects upon withdrawal of atypical neuroleptic."" ""The development of psychotic symptoms when there is excess dopamine transmission (as may occur in abrupt withdrawal) may lead some individuals to believe that increased dopamine signaling may have been responsible for the psychotic experiences an individual initially had when the drugs were first prescribed. However, individuals who had no psychiatric history have been given a course of neuroleptic treatment, and when the neuroleptics were abruptly withdrawn some of these individuals developed 'psychotic symptoms'."" This suggests that the drugs can perpetuate the mental illness long after an acute episode that required meds for a temporary use, has occurred."

Honestly a lot of communication is listening and responding to cues. Whether verbal or physical. If someone asks you how you are…you respond to the cue. A good thing is to keep it simple and remember the easy things… Most people like to talk about themselves. So ask questions to get to know them. See what they like and find your way to telling them how and what you like… It’s complex to study but it’s simple to execute. Join a club or social setting that appeals to you and practice.

How I was going to get the VCs that I knew to fund my venture, the team that I was going to assemble and so on. These Ideas were non-stop for like 2 weeks. It eventually morphed toward me also being a trap music artist. I narrowly avoided spending a bunch of money, I signed up for a couple monthly fee things which _PERSON_ able to cancel atleast. after about 1 month I started entering a more agitated phase. 1 day my gf asked me for a massage and I just blew 
up and said “IM NOT A LABOURER!!!” lolol. blew up on a couple of people. then I was off and on agitated to euphoric for most of september. ocassionaly heard voices but it was minimal atleast. Then around Oct 5th I started to drop down quite a bit. So in a nutshell I feel like a human _PERSON_. Now I have 4 weeks to finish a math course which Im almost done but I have like -100 motivation for it. So off to the library it is for me. cheers Da Level."

At face value this sounds like an awful drug for someone with a psychotic disorder. Im prescribed naltrexone. It helps manage the “reward center” of the brain that causes great feelings when using substances or feeding an addiction. Its no miracle drug by any means, but it helps take the edge off of late night cravings. Ask your doctor if it would be suitable for your situation."

175882890,Same here. My mental routine is a little different though. I usually wake up feeling not too bad. But as the day progresses I feel worse and worse until late afternoon I’m a complete mess. At least that’s how it’s been for a while. So sick and tired of it. I feel like I’m on the cusp of almost needing to be hospitalised most days lately. But just not quite bad enough to get proper help for it.

175882894,What does the cashier at the grocery store think of me when I don’t make eye contact. I seldom remember faces even if I go to the same grocery store. I know my one neighbours’ face but don’t know what his wife looks like. I live in a not so big town. People would greet me in town but I have no clue who they are. Sometimes I might put in an effort to look someone in the eyes but when I turn around and walk away I won’t recognize their face a moment later. I live in a very small village. I know only three neighbours. The rest I won’t recognize anywhere. I wonder what all these people think of me. I know they must recognize me but I don’t recognize them. It’s like I live in a world of my own. Do you experience the same?

175882898,I’m feeling down. I skipped my workout appointment today. I just didn’t feel like driving my sister to work at 6:30 in the dark to be able to have the car today. It made me anxious just thinking about it. So I was stuck without a car. I had to cancel or take a taxi. God knows how much that would’ve cost. And I don’t even know where the closest bus is or if it goes there or where to transfer. The whole thing would’ve just made me too anxious to deal with. So now I’m worried about missing the appointment because you can only miss 3 appointments and stay in this program and this is the 3rd time I’ve missed. So I don’t know if they are going to be mad at me or not. Oh well. I did what I did and now I have to accept what happens. I know I can’t miss anymore. I hope I don’t have a panic attack or get the flu or something.

174325226,"I'm a 21-year-old male who has been diagnosed with two psychiatric disorders since the age of 8: Asperger's syndrome and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. I also have no family history of psychosis or schizophrenia. I've been microdosing on LSD for the past few weeks on-and-off during my time in university, with no distressing effects. On March 16, I took a slightly larger dose at around ~20-30 micrograms in my parents' home, which was a bit stronger than I expected and I experienced a silent panic attack (Perhaps I was overthinking the effects?). I was panicking during the entire duration of the effects and I wasn't sure whether or not it was over. I assumed my panic attack must have either been a psychotic episode, or it must have triggered the onset of psychosis. So over the next few days, I was constantly analyzing myself to detect any strange new changes in my behavior and I felt slight brain fog. Then next week on March 25, I started panicking after reading the early warning signs of schizoph
renia. They seemed similar to _PERSON_, so I assumed I was gonna become psychotic. The following day on March 26, I started to feel a strange aura-like sensation in my forehead whenever I was sitting alone and wasn't preoccupied with tasks such as video games. I assumed sleep would get rid of it, so I took a melatonin pill at night and went to bed. But unfortunately I woke up in a panic attack at midnight and I thought for sure I was experiencing psychosis/schizophrenia. I woke up my father from his sleep, but the only thing he noticed about me was my shaking head and constant pacing back and forth. I eventually managed to calm down in 1-2 hours, but the strange aura-like sensation I was experiencing earlier consumed my entire head, and I was experiencing it even when I wasn't distracted by anything. Later that day, I believed I was experiencing symptoms of derealization/depersonalization. I felt extremely detached from my mind and the environment, and it felt like I was living in a foggy dream world. I was v
ery worried because sounds and colors seemed to be a little distorted and the environment around me seemed a little off-putting. I continued to experience this over the next few days, although with decreasing intensity. I strongly feared completely breaking away from reality, so I told my family members to send me to a mental institution if they noticed me experiencing a single hallucination or delusion. I now mostly calm now. However, still I occasionally feel periods of depersonalization/derealization, which sometimes gives me panic (of varying intensity) and which sometimes does not. The strange aura-like sensation in my forehead also became a mild headache. I am also sleeping for shorter periods of time and I occasionally feel lethargic ever since the panic attack on March 25."
175882949,"Okay…my team now told me ADHD-ish traits might be caused by PTSD, since I didnt have these issues before the age of 8. Whatever diagnosis they tell me next i wont believe it."
175882950,"thanks, I will try…I will try very hard to keep pushing myself harder"
175882951,"I did a maybe dumb thing. Over the weekend, I decided to stop taking my AD and my AP. My reasoning was if I am feeling this bad on the medication, why am I taking it? Seems like solid reasoning. So I stopped taking it. Really didn't notice anything until today. Today though I came to work and got super stressed because the engineer quit. So I had to take some anti-anxiety meds. Now I'm worried that by not taking my other medication I really messed up and am going to end up deeper in the hole than I was before. I don't know whether to restart the medication or just see what happens. I never do this. I always take my medications. But I've been on it for so long I felt like my brain needed a reset. My fingers feel twitchy today and I feel sort of not good but I don't know if that is not having the medicine or that is just me. I was having visual hallucinations yesterday when I wasn't on the AP. But I have them if I am on the AP too. I know I should try to see my PDOC sooner but I am afraid to make the 
call. IDK what is going on with me. I feel like maybe I am having a break down."
174325234,"Thanks for the support. I'm glad you all understand my where I'm coming from. I got 16 months left and figure I can wait my time out and see a psychologist at least once or a handful of times for some answers after I get out. The last one I had diagnosed me with Brief Psychotic Disorder at the age of 16. However, he wasn't any help with anything he said. I understand that everything is possibly all in my head but that doesn't change the fact that it is still all real to me and my reality because that's what I perceive. He didn't understand that. He mocked another patient who was experiencing delusions to me. That lead me to not tell him of any potential delusions as I couldn't trust him to keep confidentiality nor real professional help. Honestly I resent psychologists but just hope to find a decent one some day. Only thing that helped was the Risperidone. Ha. I wouldn't wish that kind of ""treatment"" on anybody and wish you all the best of luck with your endeavors when it comes to those people."

I would argue that when a sociopath makes good decisions, they are more meaningful that when someone makes good decisions because it “feels good.” It is easy to do the right thing when your emotions drive you towards it. Less so when you just do it because you know intellectually that it is the right thing to do for others."

174325241,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Differential benefits of olanzapine on executive function in schizophrenia patients: Preliminary findings. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Human psychopharmacology , Dec 2019 14 Schizophrenia patients show executive function (EF) impairments in voluntary orienting as measured by eye-movements. We tested 14 inpatients to investigate the effects of the antipsychotic olanzapine on EF, as measured by antisaccade eye-movement performance.Patients were tested at baseline (before olanzapine), 3-5?days post-medication, and 12-14?days post-medication. Patients were also assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to measure the severity of schizophrenia-related symptoms, and administered the Stroop task, a test of EF. Nine matched controls were also tested on the antisaccade and Stroop.Both groups showed improvement on Stroop and antisaccade; however, the schizophrenia group improved significantly more on antisaccade, indicating an a
dditional benefit of olanzapine on EF performance. Patients with poorer baseline antisaccade performance (High-Deficit) showed significantly greater improvement on the antisaccade task than patients with better baseline performance (Low-Deficit), suggesting that baseline EF impairment predicts the magnitude of cognitive improvement with olanzapine. These subgroups showed significant and equivalent improvement on PANSS scores, indicating that improvement on the antisaccade task with olanzapine was not a result of differences in magnitude of clinical improvement.This preliminary study provides evidence that olanzapine may be most advantageous for patients with greater baseline EF deficits."

I suppose I just got really afraid. It seems to me like mental illness is seriously mishandled in today's age. I don't know why, just that I think in my case, people didn't understand me. Nobody ever understood exactly what I was going through except for me. Thus it seems like no one can ever have much insight into the nature of mental illness because it's a personal thing. I am not sure why I am thinking this way. Perhaps I've gotten to the point where I don't really mind voicing my opinions? Usually I'm on the fence about meds and therapy and stuff."

175883027,"It’s good to hear from you again. You said it was therapeutic to read the comments of others who have bipolar. It’s very refreshing from this side to hear your nice remarks. What was the mental breakdown about? Did you go to the hospital or get any medicine? I was abused by my mother, and at about 27, after I had lost a job and was becoming more and more angry, and couldn’t get it together to see a psychiatrist, my temper unleashed on my mother and I couldn’t relax until I had a nervous breakdown. I then got psychiatric help, which I should have done before. But there at 27, I blamed her for everything, while for the first over 25 years, I didn’t blame her for anything. I was then perhaps realizing how harmful she had been. I was also becoming unglued and at 27 was in the age range of showing signs of bipolar. (Net sites say average age of onset can be 21 or 25, although it can start in teens.) This is similar to what you said: “I noticed my mood change almost instantly after my dad pas
sed away. I was so flipping angry. I would throw anything in front of me at my mom and tell her I would not go home (stayed the night at friend's place A LOT).” This may be a sign of your bipolar outbreak, also, and you don’t want to be like me and sit by and do nothing until it perhaps becomes worse. If it gets worse, you won’t be in as good of a shape to do something about it as you are now. Better take advantage of this relative calm, is my guess from experience, mostly bad. I did go to a psychiatrist at that point, got misdiagnosed and miss-medicated for about 10 years. That’s why people here are warning you to heed your therapist and be familiar with bipolar in hopes you won’t be misdiagnosed and miss-medicated. An example of that is your general practitioner giving you an anti-depressant, but with no mood stablelizer such as Lithium to handle it when you went from depressed to manic, it caused problems. So let the buyer beware. As far as your father, that does sound like a horrendous situation
. My mother was sexually abused and caused all kinds of problems for us children. Do you have any idea why your father took drugs? Did he have physical pain, was he emotionally torn up, like with bipolar, but didn’t go to a psychiatrist? You might want to ask you mother about this for she might know, for instance, what he was like before he took those drugs. Also, was he showing symptoms of bipolar, such as periods of mania and depression? Did he also abuse her, you were saying? You said, “I take pride that I have never hit any one!!!” That is very good. There is a saying, ““We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, “Oh, nothing!” Pride helps; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our hurts— not to hurt others.” _NAME_, 1874, _PERSON_ You added: “BUT, when I am extremely down AND mad at myself I have hit my head on what ever is aro
und. I used to pull my hair quite a bit. I do hit my hand on counters ans walls. One time I smacked one hand on a washer three times as hard as I could and bruised two fingers. That was two years ago. I never want to do that again. I much prefer to be in physical pain rather than mental pain any day. “I don't know why but I felt compelled to tell you all this.....” Maybe it’s because as children we learned about our self-worth from people who didn’t have any. And as children, we believed that. I mentioned being positive. For years, I had a negative outlook, from my childhood training or from my bipolar or both. Would you say your household was negative? That could have seeped into your thinking."

She said lithium would only be an option if zyprexa doesn’t help. I’m on so much medication that I dont know whether I’m coming or going. 10mg is a therapeutic dose she told me and is hopeful it will kick in and recharge my dead battery. Anyone here on 10mg zyprexa. Does it help you. I have treatment resistant depression so I’m scared nothing is going to work. I’m taking 10mg abilify, 300mg lyrica and 300mg effexor, I space out the dose of lyrica to 100mg three times daily.

My pdoc says stop thinking its neurological because I saw so many neurologists that said it’s not MS or any other neurological disorder that I’m thinking wrongly. I cant shift the thought its neurological because of my symptoms. Somataform disorder anxiety and depression are my diagnosis. I feel theres something else wrong. One pdoc told me I am hypochondriac. I’m not, I dont think, but maybe I’m delusional as well and have to trust what my pdoc is telling me, that all my symptoms are psychological. Thanks"

174325265,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells causes long-term alleviation of schizophrenia-like behaviour coupled with increased neurogenesis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Molecular psychiatry , Dec 2019 11 Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disease with a mixed genetic and environmental aetiology. Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis was suggested both as a pathophysiological mechanism and as a target for therapy. In the present study, we utilized intracerebroventricular transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as a means to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the ketamine-induced neurodevelopmental murine model for schizophrenia. Syngeneic MSC have successfully engrafted and survived for up to 3 months following transplantation. Improvement in social novelty preference and prepulse inhibition was noted after transplantation. In parallel to behavioural improvement, increased hippocampal neurogenesis as reflected in the numbers of doublec
ortin expressing neurons in the dentate gyrus and gene expression was noted both 2 weeks following transplantation as well as 3 months later compared with nontreated animals. An independent aging effect was observed for both behaviour and neurogenesis, which was attenuated by MSC treatment. As opposed to MSC treatment, short-term treatment with clozapine was efficient only during treatment and diminished 3 months later. Interestingly, while shortly after transplantation (2 weeks) behavioural improvement was correlated mainly to FGF2 gene expression, 3 months later it was mainly correlated to the expression of the notch ligand DLL1. This suggests that long-term effect during ageing may depend on neural stem cell self-renewal. We conclude that a single intracerebroventricular injection of bone marrow-derived MSC can suffice for long-term reversal of changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and improve schizophrenia-like behavioural phenotype inflicted by developmental exposure to ketamine in mice. In this stud
y they used mesenchymal stem cells that were closely genetically matched and injected into the ventricles of adult mice. They found that it reversed the deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and observed behavioral improvements. This is a different research group than the previous studies that came out around ~2013 ~2016."

I suspect if I was on a different medication my supplement regime would be somewhat different. Against cognitive decline I use: amino acid complex powder, which basically gives the brain the building blocks to make whatever hormones and signal cells it needs. I use pea protein right now. I would use whey, but I’m allergic to it. Protein powder has so much protein it actually makes me feel full so I can take an amino drink as lunch. They are also supposed to work better if you take them on empty stomach. Helps me not gain too much weight. I take 1 topped table spoon each day. Lechitin. Our brain is made up of 2/3 of this so supplementing with it seems logical. 1200mg each morning.

They are good company and a great form of social interaction if you are lacking friends. They are great at building confidence to the point where I am now able to go to coffee shops, shopping etc. and will be attending a yoga group soon. It gives me a sense of purpose and a reason to get up in the morning, to have a shower and get dressed on the days that my support worker is coming. All this support is thanks to the new National Disability Insurance Scheme here in Australia where funds are allocated for support services to people with either physical disabilities or mental illness dependant upon their severity.

Recently I researched mortality and psychiatry for a friend of mine who is on the board of a very large mental health institution. Where some research claims that people die young because of smoking, cardiovascular disease and suicide; I personally feel that the negative symptoms cause a lack of health discipline. And as the above article points out there are some less understood and often untreated symptoms of schizophrenia that can shorten you life. I am now 61 years old and I do not intend to die soon. I do intermittent fasting, exercise, did twice a senolytic treatment, take lots of dietary supplements, am lacto-ovo-vegetarian, do not use alcohol or tobacco, take my daily risperdal.

175883204,"If you are in a relationship with a person who has a personality disorder or is for some other reason, unable to connect to you in an emotionally satisfying way, then you probably find yourself in a “double bind dynamic” (_PERSON_, 2017). If you have tried to connect to your loved one by asking for him or her to change, you have most likely been told, “This is who I am, take it or leave it.” You may have decided through cognitive reasoning within your own head, that you will accept this person as is; thinking, “After all, no one’s perfect!” And you carry on with your life, following his/her “rules of engagement.” This is the double bind. You decide to stay involved with a person, see that person often, yet continuously be deprived of emotional connection. This means, that you are with someone you care about, yet you feel constantly empty. This is because although you are interacting with the person, there is no attunement or emotional resonance in the relationship. Attunement and

I’ve always maintained my housing, no matter how psychotic & alcoholic I am. I think it’s because I worked as a social worker with homeless folk & saw how dangerous it was for them. Emergency accommodation my employer provided was high risk."

I think _AT_MENTION_ s caption contest images are good along with people’s captions.including _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_. I think _AT_MENTION_ is funny as his authentic self. I find _AT_MENTION_ s conversations with certain people are quite funny. I’m refer to those where there may be a slight disagreement. I found _AT_MENTION_ s way of assertiveness to certain situations etc can be funny too.

175883224,"I never had a voice convince me of something, but I’ve had delusions, that some sort of world altering event was happening. I thought the world was restarting or something. I dunno. It was a lot of emotions competing to be the forefront. I cried and was happy and it was just really a lot to feel at the time. After that it took me probably 4 months of just playing with the idea of the possiblity that it was real or not, and I finally decided that “well I’m still here, so’s everything else.” Nothing probably happened. Must have been a psychotic break. The visual information I thought was interesting from the hallucinations were minor qwerks more then mind blowing or anything. I dunno. I just kept my skepticism. Its not like I was delusional all my life, so I figure the new thing was probably the most suspect thing. I’m sure its just as trippy and scary for you as it is for everyone going through these things. I’m not actively delusional with my day to day life. I get a bout every now an
d again. I hope you the best."

175883230,Be safe _AT_MENTION_ . At least you can call him back and confirm he said 90mg.
175883231,I’ve made a lot of changes in my medications and some worked amazingly well and some failed miserably. Still. I don’t regret trying for better function and that is a worthwhile goal. It can bite you on the ass sometimes when you want to go back to a med and it takes more of it but with that in mind I don’t blame you for trying. Work with your doctor and consider the information you can find. I moved from risperdal to zyprexa and it was a good move for me. We are all different and that doesn’t help but it could be worth a shot.

174325304,"Me too. I’m still paranoid ever since I heard that voice. It’s the one thing that meds don’t take care of. I also think people on TV and celebrities are clones that were killed off. I think most people would call that a delusion but I think it’s real. I’m thinking about going to school to keep my mind off of things. I feel like a bad person for not doing anything like moving away but I see pros and cons for both situations of staying and leaving. Besides I saw that as a symptom moving away and that’s another reason I’m not. I hope I’m just schizophrenic and all this stuff isn’t real. It’s hard feeling like such a bad person. I don’t feel motivated to do anything. I guess we just have to tell ourselves that voices are NOT real! Such advanced telepathy would likely not be used on us if we are just normal people anyway. Why waste their time? I think I was a terrorist, so this doesn’t help me. Everyone here and my family think I wasn’t though. I would just write raps. I never

175883259,"Mine helps a lot…it’s a little too light, though. Just a smidge. One thing which helps for me, whether it’s placebo or not, is using it at the same time each day. I’ve found, getting to sleep at the right time helps manage without having to really lean into, or on, high doses of atypical antipsychotics. I turn off both the phones and the lights, put in my earplugs, and tense then calm my muscles from my face to my toes, in turn. I become like a spaghetti noodle, then let the blanket push and hold me down. Without light, sound, or the ability to really fidget around and be restless, I find it easy to fall asleep."

I feel like as soon as I mention this to my parents, they'll just discount it. I wonder if sometimes my parents are a negative influence on me. As soon as I express any discomfort with the way things are going, my parents will encourage me to just go back on the medication combination that I want (which is not always the best decision to make because it paralyzes me, basically). I am somewhat blaming this on my parents because I think it's partially their fault. I need better support from them."

175883292,"I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and agree that maybe you get mistreated on here sometmes. But c’mon, you know exactly why you get flagged a lot. AA, CA and NA teach people a lot. One of their most basic tenets is that if you are in a conflict with someone don’t get in some big emotional argument and have a clash of wills and blame it all on the other guy. They tell you instead to back off and calm down and look for your part in it. If you feel picked on or like people are singling you out than look at yourself and your actions and see how you’re contributing to the problem. And try to resolve the issue in a way that both sides come away validated and satisfied. I personally have nothing against you.But I read your posts and you keep making the same mistakes. No one is going to attack you for no reason. You weren’t just arbitrarily picked out of all the members and singled out for abuse for no reason. You tend to post the same topics like religion or you tend to put down women. Thos
e seem to be the biggest issues that put you at odds with other members. And you know this. Yet you keep doing it. You know the rules.

That you wish happiness and peace for your mother, but you're hurt that she doesn't seem to want that for herself. That it's very tough for you to hold yourself back, but she needs to be the one to decide that she will seek help. Don't blame or make it long drawn out.

Ive relapsed before so I know not to go off my medications and know how tough of a struggle it’s been to attain some normalcy. This illness is very tough to deal and even in this day and age they still don’t know the causes so hoping for a cure is wasting time. I do my best to manage this illness with the depression it has caused. It’s been 2 years so far and my symptoms have just started to get better but I’m starting to have other health issues that make progress feel like a waste of time. I do my best to stay busy with work and making a little bit of money so I don’t have to rely on my parents for financial support. I still live with them and am looking to get married hopefully with an amazing wife and eventually move out and try to live on my own and gain some independence.

175883322,Practice meditation. Develop a habit to think before doing any action. Impulsivity is when reacting to every impulse. When get some impulse or urge take a moment to think about its consequences before acting on it. The reason why impulsivity occur is because of lack of thinking. Sz can make it hard to think quickly but possible to think by taking time. Because of hard to think a quick way is to act without much thought this is when problem starts. So take enough time to think but only act after thinking process is over. This way delay the responses.

Feel them with every nanoparticle of your being. Let the pain wash over and through you. Accept the horrible feelings. Don't fight them. Let them come. And then let them go of their own accord. If you fight them, they will fight you back and become stronger. So do not fight them. Accept them. Truly ACCEPT them."

If one reads my post thoroughly, I make this assertion without trying to tell you _PERSON_ what to do directly regarding physicians. My thoughts on asking yourself in the mirror if you have really been able to try your best after these past 3 months speak plainly to this point. Is a physician ""the"" answer to everything? Often, yes, sometimes no, but not my particular point. What I was trying explain was is that if you are honest with yourself about your efforts to date _PERSON_, I think the conclusions should be self-evident. The posts of support here all all appear in agreement and bringing oneself to make an appointment and get a physician's consultation does take a little courage and a nudge. All of it however, must begin with you taking charge of your intent to improve and acting upon it. ~ cres"

That’s a pity about meditation. It does have some good benefits such as developing compassion for yourself and others.

There's an individual goal that I don't know what to put. Maybe my boss has some suggestions.

But 1st of all we must be more than logical yet with fullest reasoning to ourself, saying 1st of all, by logical reasoning, are you(or me) that of an important figure to make some higher authority in the country to “spy” on you(or me)? you know spying one person intensively can be very money consuming? what occupation or values or networthed are you that requires such heavily debtful research or spying on you? most of the time, people research or spy on someone for certain values or 
a certain thing that they want it from you. second of all. if the 1st part is highly false, then comes to the second part which is, is it really so highly scientific for PEOPLE or some higher authority to spy on you? and what are the chances in highly logical and reason and science point of view of reasoning for that to happen? everyone can have suspicions, if one have no suspicions, it’s deadly, if one is highly suspicions then it is also deadly to the person himself/herself. so find your balance."

I didn’t really think much of it because I just felt good and not that impulsive. I even told the doctor I didn’t think I was hypomanic. I was sleeping normally. I felt a dip in my mood for a week felt a bit depressed now I feel up and great again! I want to do things. This feels more hypomanic than before. I’m terrible at tracking this **** unless it’s super obvious."
175883460,So mania makes us like _PERSON_? I have sz not sza so don’t know what mania feels.
175883461,Tried Wellbutrin and it made the voices more present. Hopefully it won’t have any side effects for you _AT_MENTION_!
175883462,I haven't received any of my vape packages (yet?). I wish I had ordered from the one I wanted to order from while there was still time.
175883463,Hi _AT_MENTION_. They said because I was immoral and obscene. I have OCD of intrusive thoughts. I am talking to my therapist today.
175883464,"I’m tempted to take an extra dose of my meds. I feel terrible. I have to get an ultrasound today to rule out breast cancer because I’ve got some random bloody discharge and a really sore spot. No idea why. Anyways, I think I’m going to go to the er after that. I can’t take this much longer."
175883465,"I used to play scrabble with my parents as a teenager. They were very good. I beat them occasionally. Some time back I joined https://www.isc.ro/ . I quit when someone started to get personal,in an inquisitive way. It was a definite case of self _USER_ID_ on my part. I’m not ultra competitive, hence I don’t go out of my way, as some do, to find as many new words as possible to use. Those are very competitive types. They’d probably start mentally self flagellating if they only scored 500 on a game. I played occasionally with my wife. Her strengths were more non-verbal than verbal though."
175883466,I think it’s a different way of saying psychosis. Pretty much the same thing.

175883471,"Hello, welcome to the forums. The truth is when it comes to meds it is pretty much trial and error. What works on one person has no effect on another. You’ll find people on this forum that have success with, for example, haldol, while others had a really bad experience with it. The truth is the only way you will know if a medication will work, or not work, with you is to try it. I’ve tried numerous medications. Some effective, some not effective, some with bad side effects, some with no side effects. When I read up on them I heard all kinds of experiences, good and bad, with all of them."

174325363,"Hello, is there anyone with simple schizophrenia? The doctors diagnosed me with anxiety and depression, but I’m not sure. The problem is that I feel very empty. I feel like I live only in my head and not in reality. Old memories, songs, various phrases that I’ve heard somewhere flash in my head. I feel like I’m losing myself. My memory is terrible I can barely remember what it was like in the morning. Life is just going next to me, I won’t come involved in it. I only do things that I have to do, otherwise I don’t like anything. I communicate poorly with people, I think I stop talking. Please write if anyone has the same. Thank you very much . PS: I don’t speak much English, so I write using a compiler. I’m sorry for mistakes."

174325360,"My daily suffering and hell has improved exponentially, but I have less motivation now than ever. It could be a med switch or confusion. I tried and failed to go back to community college a few times. I never get passed signing up for a class before dropping it. Never made it to the stage of paying for it and showing up. It’s karma and it’s bad. I think online is the way to go for me. I think _PERSON_ and Coursera are safer and better alternatives for me. It’s freeish and cheaper and much, much shorter. I have less of an attention span to complete a longer course. It’s not necessarily easier or harder per se, just different. Furthermore, I don’t have to worry about my hygiene or transportation or books and stuff. I cannot express enough how much suffering I had by having intrusive thoughts 24/7 and nightmarish and hellish vision that was so distorted I don’t know how I functioned and walked. It seemed like a neurological disease or even physical damage more so than schizophrenia. It cou
ld have been synthetic marijuana (although I have no memory of this) or that substance I bought online that I never figured out what it was in 2011. It must have been a Shamanish thing similar to _USER_ID_. _USER_ID_ is a nightmare too and could have been the culprit too. Maybe I smoked too much and got brain or eye damage. I always thought I had PTSD or acute stress disorder from a kidnapping or torture thing similar to Montauk Boys Program. There’s no evidence or proof or anything. Only thing I can think is it was a highly intelligent race of aliens that took me to Mars for years (I felt this for a long ass time) or the Men in Black per se. I have dreams of being a Super Soldier and stuff too. I don’t know what to say or how to explain it but it’s like time was frozen when I left this earth and came back here from a different worldline countless times. I don’t expect anyone to believe me. The super soldier stuff is a fantastical explanation. I’ve heard stories. The horror of feeling like I was dyi
ng or kidnapped and brought to Mars is an extreme conspiracy theory and fear I had. It’s called the Secret Space Program. Not sure why I would be in all these different programs. Unless it started out as MK-Ultra and then it was like a gateway to these other programs and projects. I don’t even consider this my first or real life or base reality at all. I feel like I’m a failed experiment or project for the Montauk Project. Like I watched a video saying if you make it, it’s similar to joining the Illuminati, which I might have been in in a past life…and I’m not anymore and hate them and despise them wholeheartedly. I never understand these people or why they picked me. Even my craziness can’t fathom how I’ve been in all these projects or programs. Even other people haven’t been involved in this many stuff. I never wanted this or deserved this at all. I ended up with schizophrenia. I wanted to be an investment banker or eventually work in private equity or a hedge fund. I don’t know if they 
wanted me dead or to become a “world leader” of sorts; but it was a failed experiment and I wanted out of it. I think I escaped and got out of it. But I keep resurrecting in the past and reliving my life over and over again like eternal recurrence, except reality does change a bit. My worst fear is going back in time and reliving the horrors and worse bits of paranoia and schizo-affective disorder - depressive type. I don’t really know where to post this. Should I have made my own thread? To the future, I don’t know. I would like to make some money and get better and perhaps have a job even working at something like Walmart, Costco, or Lowe’s for instance. Just something so I can make some extra cash and stay on disability. Maybe an extra $800 a month. I know it’s possible and legal, but then they might ????? and moan and say I’m not disabled and take me off eventually. SSI is definitely not enough to live on and I don’t deserve it like people on SSDI or SS through retirement. I never paid int
o it. I wish sort of we could live in a more empathetic society where people like me were taken care of more. Luckily, I have family that takes care of me. Government cannot. Where the government fails, my family comes in. I think it was the NSA that did this to me personally. I had a former friend in college that tried joining and maybe they targeted me based on that. I don’t know. I didn’t deserve this. Maybe she had nothing to do with this at all. With regards to the super soldier thing, I was more of a lover and a writer than a fighter. I’m more psychic than anything and I can time travel, which I hate. I’ve time traveled more than a thousand or so times and I hate it and never want to do it again."

175883480,Excellent. Hope it stays that way for you!
175883481,They say the meds are for them to get rid of me. They also torture me all day about other things. This makes me not want to take meds because I do not want to do what these mean voices tell me to do. Anyone else have voices telling them to take their meds?
175883482,Its nice to hear from someone who experienced this too. My team think I’m not psychotic because I am coherent then I get confused when they chop and change and say one thing then the next. Like they say oh you’re a different type of sz because you don’t have cognitive decline. _AT_MENTION_ do you have to have cognitive decline to be sz? Sorry I know your not a doctor but I have all these questions and talking to someone who actually experiences it is much better than any doctor tbh

175883534,"You absolutely do not need to feel guilty for your thoughts being “heard”, there’s no way to read your mind without electrodes literally being put on your scalp and a trained scientist literally calibrating things to even come close to reading your mind. You are absolutely free to think and feel whatever you want, but there are some things going on that might indicate you’re thinking about someone, for instance, if you look at someone, and they see you staring at them…they can probably put together that you may be thinking about them, or judging their appearance. Stuff like that is totally normal, they can’t read your mind, they can only barely guess sometimes. Mind reading isn’t science fiction, there’s physical phenomenon going on, but its purely a science thing. You can sorta tell if someone is agitated if they’re worried etc. There are physical tells for those things, things like body language. If you aren’t paying attention to how you’re moving, or if you’re looking aro

175883565,That’s great. I’m sorry you have to wait though. Hopefully it will be worth the wait. If she’s booked that far she’s probably great.

175883571,"Pretty similar to you. When I am really ill the conversations in my head take over everything and I have no room for my own thoughts. That’s when I truly lose my mind. I have a theory from when I get sick that my mind is connected to every living soul in the universe, and I am communicating with them all and it is millions of different things and people that talk to me. I can see their auras as well and they show me images. Once I could see dead soldiers every time I close my eyes and they made me draw their memories. I was very sick though"
174325395,"I think that in general, people with psychotic disorders like to avoid going to the doctors. I know that I personally hate going to doctors visits. I haven’t seen a dentist in years. I keep procrastinating but I eventually do end up going to see my gp and getting blood tests. I have an appointment with my family doctor in 2 weeks."
175883572,"For the attachment disorder I get ongoing support from community nursing. I have lots of anxieties because of attachment, this manifests itself with lack of feeling secure, becoming homeless and or lack of financial security. I get comprehensive support from community nursing as this prevents me from being admitted to hospital long term and let’s me live in the community. I get the ongoing support for the attachment disorder alone as they is the biggest challenge, more so the the SZA. My pdoc says that I don’t need to jeopardise supported living placements as I will always have their support."

175883575,I am sorry _AT_MENTION_ I hope one day you and your parents will get along and you’ll be able to forgive them… My dad used to be an alcoholic and said horrible things growing up as well. I am sorry you’re currently stuck in this situation. I’m glad you have a counselor.
175883576,I did that at the beginning of the lockdown too. I gained 10 pounds at first. Then I started the diet and lost 45.
175883577,"I had a bad time on that one too You would know for certain after a week or two if it doesn’t suit you, call your prescriber asap"
175883578,For me it was my family. I made one serious attempt and always had a plan. My other plan I wouldn’t have survived for sure. The feelings always go away. Don’t act on them. Call 911 if you can’t control yourself. That’s what the mental hospital is for. I dread November’s. It’s coming up. That’s always when the suicidal ideation seems to come for me. But I am safe. Won’t act on it again. You need to get there too.
175883579,"I’m sorry that you have been through all of this. I used to feel very crappy mentally as well. The supplements sarcosine and fish oil have helped me. While I still dont feel perfect I have noticed improvement. I’m not a fan of antidepressants. If you haven’t tried supplements yet, I would recommend giving them a try."
175883580,"My psychiatrist told me that she thinks I’m currently in a manic episode. My question is, does mania give you extra strength that you wouldn’t normally have? I ask this because I was just able to carry a disassembled bed frame up a flight of stairs and I don’t think I normally would have been able to do that. Could this be the mania or have I just gotten stronger without realizing it?"

174325391,"Most of the participants were found to have a low level of EBV-associated antibodies, which suggests that many had already been exposed to this common virus. But when comparing the different levels of these antibodies, the researchers noticed a curious difference between the two groups. It appeared that those with schizophrenia were 1.7 to 2.3 times more likely to have increased levels of some specific types of EBV antibodies. The research is buttressed by a recent study, which found that those with autoimmune disorders are around 40 percent more likely to develop psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. it is great findings, isn’t it? a huge difference of the nunbers of EBV antibody indeed imo"

And if you have an illness in addition to sz/sza (like myself), please don’t think this illness is your fault either. We all went through so much. And you deserve better. _AT_MENTION_ and I were talking about not opening up about ourselves on another thread. When people started talking about autism, I finally had the courage to say that I was suspected to have one years ago. It took away a lot of shame and guilt I had about being off as a child. This forum is a blessing to me. I cherish everyone on here so much. This forum allowed me to open up and share a community of diverse individuals. Please don’t be ashamed. You are loved, you are cared for, and you are cherished."

174325398,"For negative symptoms you need to develop good daily habits and need to follow them strictly without fail. For example going to bed at night and waking up at fixed times, not using bed during other times, exercising regularly like at least two times a week, bathing at least every two days etc. This is how you manage the side effects of negative symptoms."

Just because you’re not incapacitated doesn’t mean that schizophrenic psychosis isn’t eating away at your brain. My pdoc says that meds help slow that process, even if they’re not working perfectly. Schizophrenia isn’t a personality trait. No one’s trying to be a gatekeeper, and no one’s trying to reject you just for the sake of rejecting you, but _AT_MENTION_ is right. Schizophrenics need their meds. All schizophrenics need their meds, if for no reason but to slow the cognitive decline that often accompanies schizophrenia."

I have worked as and emergency nurse for about 8 years. Before _NAME_ nursing, I was in graduate school for medical/cultural anthropology and my research was on opiates and addiction. I have some personal experience with SSRIs and I have spoken at length with many patients about their experiences with antipsychotics and other anti-depressants. I would like to get a more involved history for a person regarding their use of medications to manage symptoms. . .and then also to learn about side effects and how these were managed.

Ive completely changed as a person and for the better. My mental capacity, focus, clarity and overall social capabilities have improved dramatically. My girlfriend of 8 years has seen a huge change in me, along with other people in my life. The thing is i dont follow his regiment. I find when i hit the 4 hour mark, i start to feel an increase in symptoms. I usually start to feel anxious so i take a dose every 4 hours or so. Initially i started to take niacin while i was on medication to see if there where any improvements and there was. I researched that you should take 3 doses a day so i did. When i came off my medication it was a struggle and i decided to stay on haloperidol. Over the course of 2 years i played with it until i found a dose that works and ive stuck with it ever since. I get regular blood checks with no repercussio
ns so far. Even though my regiment stays the same i notice major improvements every few months. Niacin has the possibility to permanently cure schizophrenia with long term treatment. The good thing about it is you dont have to come off medication to experience the positive effects. Who ever did the studies missed something in their research. Maybe it was the dose, the patients, la"

What helps me is finding some things to do. I like watching sports on TV, reading the news on the internet, and taking walks with friends. Another thing that helps is having friends who like to talk on the telephone. Also, when my lack of motivation got pretty bad, my doctor added an activating anti-depressant (Wellbutrin/Bupropion). When I get depressed I sit and think about it and then I write about it here on this forum and the people usually respond and help me out."

175883639,_AT_MENTION_ . Please seek the appropriate medical help. You are repeating the same thing endlessly which is a pretty good sign you have some serious problems with your thoughts. These thoughts aren’t normal and a reason why you need to seek some help. It doesn’t matter the diagnosis. What matters is medications to help you get out of this endless loop.

175883651,I take it. It’s ok. But your dose is very low. You may find you’ll need a bit more pretty soon to help you out. It’s like Benadryl’s cousin. So it sort of makes you a little drowsy and dries you out a bit. But it does calm you down and bring down the nervousness. So if you’ve ever had Benadryl and liked it you’ll like this.

175883665,"I never actually had any med help, so I’m gonna say it like this, I’ve not had any APs, ADs or mood stabilizers since March 2019. I have not been put in psych ward, but I am med resistant so my current pdoc and I are doing this. I take 4mg of xanax a day, set times. Been since October. We up the dosage as I get worse, and since she looked into lumateperone for me and saw too many bad interactions for me, I’m not allowed to try that. I just have to do a 45 min appt every 4-8 weeks, but can call anytime if i need higher xanax. I have to keep talking to my therapist, she doesn’t care about what, but it’s so those two can get together and see my worst times and if we can find triggers. She also know I have drinks and says I can have 3 a week, I’m a wine cooler or screwdriver drinker, but I have my rules on if I drink I don’t drink until it’s been 12 hours from last sip. We as a team, adding my husband into pdoc and therapist, have decided I cannot healthily go into a psych ward again be
cause I was sexually assaulted at the last was I was at, and I’ve been out since March 2008. I had 5 visits from June 2007 until March 2008. All same facility, but my husband was able to get my GP to get me out once she knew everything that happened at all visits. I’m not gonna say it’s easy, but we also think if we get my RSD and osteoarthritis pain under control that a lot may change. But I did go off my meds back with the old doc in March, no permission, and I now have the letter from the center saying she was let go for patient mistreatment and causing harm. So going to the board with the system, then also her license board, paid off. And my current pdoc showed me about 30 pages of notes added while she wasn’t supposed to access my file anymore. And we are told that since old doc put in it can’t be removed but she addendumed and put what ???????? was put in. I have my 3 kids at home and my husband works 3rd shift. I go nowhere alone, ever, esp doc appts. And my husband I have him ok anything dra

I know the feeling.. Of working so hard on myself and no one noticing.. My family notices. It was a big blow to me when the people on the video chat said I wasn't doing enough.. I used to be severely depressed and did nothing and now I'm doing everything because I'm interested and they said ""You have to find something to live and die for - and not your mom""."

174325413,"Yeah I think the general prognosis is schizophrenia can have lower functioning individuals although there are outliers(small percentage). bipolar might have closer to normal because of the inbetween zones of say mild depression to hypomania, easier to function. but on the extreme scale of severe depression or mania with psychosis then you are not functioning. I have a bipolar dx currently because I am higher functioning overall. but there are times when im very low functioning just not constant. I have also had psychosis with no mood element. So that puts me over to the sza department. Its really all a blend of symptoms with different levels of function. and the dx is used to help provide you the proper treatment plan."

175883686,"Every time I’m off meds I relapse. I wish I was 100x stronger mentally and physically. I often think of my past lives where I was off meds and just carried on through and was either homeless or recovered enough to be a huge success. Not sure if that was just wishful, fantastical thinking or just not real. I definitely had past lives in the multiverse but don’t want to risk homelessness again or ruining my family unit again. I love my family and they love me. We need to stick together. I was weird back then like in my original lives. That’s why I think there’s something superfishy on how I got schizophrenia. Sort of like a thriller movie or something. Maybe aliens, God, or just an eternal curse."
175883687,Schizophrenia is a thought disorder usually not involving mood disorders so it sounds to me that you either have schizoaffectve disorder or Bi-polar with psychotic tendency. I most suggest meds that help regulate your moods
175883688,"Ok, I am not a Psychiatrist, and this may be totally weird advice, but with voices the thing that worked for me was reasoning through disagreements and just being kind and communicating with them until there was a balance met. Sounds weird maybe, but the way I see it is - it’s your mind and your life. You can just tell the voices to bugger off and shut the heck up in your mind or simply point out everything they are doing that’s wrong (like attacking someone when they feel down). What happened for me was that an equilibrium was reached and I have control. They don’t have power over you, you have power over them. I recommend to practice saying “No”, and meaning it in your mind. Also, the more you better your life, the weaker the voices get in my experience. I started this boring sleep schedule during the week and I am eating healthy and things are much better."

175883691,"I’ve thought about sex a lot and on one occasion had a serious shot at it with a woman. I was horny as _PERSON_ but still didn’t bite. My situation made it difficult to ask someone out as I often was living at my Mom’s house, had no car, at times had no job, eventually became unattractive due to the meds, and much of the time had no place of my own. The main thing though was a strong sexual aversion anxiety probably caused by sexual violations at the hands of my peers when I was young. I believe it’s called tactile defensiveness as I don’t like people to be close to me. I also wake up at absurdly early hours and live in a place where I would break the rules in order to have it. I have questioned my sexuality often but there’s little question I will probably never really have sex because I’m really not interested in it. Thank you."

It’s been tough not coming off as awkward around coworkers, and I find myself feeling really insecure and lacking confidence in group situations. I was hired as a seasonal employee for the holidays, and now they’re deciding which seasonal hires to keep on board. It’s down to the wire, as there are three open spots and four hires left. Part of me would like to stay, but I just fear that I’ll never truly “vibe” with my coworkers. The other part of me is at peace with being let go-- it’s been pretty stressful at times trying to keep the anxiety at bay, and that stress has certainly been a challenge most days. I’ve contacted my therapist but have yet to make an appointment, since my days off and my therapist’s appointment openings haven’t lined up as of yet. Hoping to talk to her about why I feel like everyone around me hates me, and hopefully how to get over this feeling of dread I get during certain social si

Ever since then I have no more apnea problems. I still have apnea but this machine takes care of it.

175883803,"Absolutely. Prior to my psychoses - my value system was a little broken. I’d cheated on girlfriends, and been a bit of a dick to people in general. During my psychoses I tend to get really hung up on one specific abstract concept. Power, Reciprocity, Reputation, Etc. And because my thoughts are racing - I philosophise and introspect extremely deeply about each of these topics (in between the super-paranoid spiralling thought-patterns and dellusional beliefs). The learnings from these periods of introspection have stayed with me long after the effects of my psychoses have gone. And I have applied these learnings to myself and my life. I would say that my “character” has improved a heck of a lot as a result of the psychoses and that I’ve become more aware of my self and of a lot of other stuff."

175883817,"Being a mental health worker or professional is a great way to make a living for lots of people. But even individuals who love working with those with mental illness, such as psychiatrists, therapists, etc., need to take a break every so often. Even those who love what they do need to go on a vacation every now and then. However, sometimes a mental health provider doesn't always realize that he or she needs to take a break. Sometimes their coworkers see it first. Sometimes their coworkers see that the person is getting stressed out and unhappy with their line of work before they do. I remember when I was in a mental hospital back in 2011, I worked with a psychiatrist who clearly needed to take a vacation. I think she cared about me as her patient. But at the same time, I saw that she was getting stressed out. And I don't think she realized it. So if you work in the mental health field, or if you're a patient like I was, you may see that a provider needs a vacation before that individual realizes it

175883822,"A lot of psychiatrists are harried by too great a caseload, so it is really hard for them to give each case the attention it deserves. That said, I wish a few psychiatrists could experience some of the side effects we go through. They might be more pliable on med’s if that were the case. Be assertive with your pdocs. Let them know what the med’s are doing to you that you don’t like. Diabetes is a serious medical condition. You shouldn’t have to endure that if there are any good alternatives."

I mean I guess the upside is, if something is coming for me, it might take me quick? I've had sinus infections/colds whatever I have right now almost every month for the last year and then some but never dealt with lymph nodes in my groin. Maybe a stray one once in a while with the flu but it's been so long Its hard to remember. It's really hard to stay positive because I'm also legitimately under the weather.

Hopefully you’ll be able to find a new one when you move that’s more sympathetic it can sometimes take some time to find a good one but it’ll be worth it in the end.

174325469,"This correlates with my development of the disorder. Perception is reality and twice I had my physical safety called into question. I even had family put on the table. Safety is _PERSON_ most basic need, and if it’s threatened it can cause a ‘baseline of excitement’ with excitement being a euphemism. It’s stress and a secret usually, which can’t help. The less impactful threat might have mattered more bc I was younger. But the ‘truest turd’ I crossed paths with in my lifetime left me thinking I had (schizophrenia “squared”.) I coined a term anyway for how it felt."

It bears some resemblance to my UNMEDICATED mania first up, and the Fifth one where I didn't notice it coming on and stopped all medication. But it is ALWAYS quite handleable if I just take all the pills. I get a lot of work done. Writing especially. The writer says she HATES her ideas later on. I have always looked back on my writings and they fall into three categories. 1 - Crap that I no longer understand: this is minimal and is largely due to shorthand I think I will remember later but don't. 2 - Okay stuff, good ideas to expand on, good character creations, interesting plot ideas etc. Usually more clear and conscise than I usually write. Shorter sentences, less editing, less over explanation. 3 - Stuff I couldn't match at my best for creativity of ideas, and even beauty of language. This is another minimum but some gems to look back on. It reads like me firing on all 8 cylinders with no inhibition. Love _NAME_"

I literally was reading four books at a time, I kept my books next to my bed and read out of each one of them before going to sleep. I stopped reading about 3 months after I got diagnosed. Books were like food and water to me. I craved them. I liked sports like football and baseball and basketball but I liked reading more. Books were a big part of who I was.

175883972,Pdocs know to look out for this. They have a way of asking questions and you may not even realize what they are doing. If you are on some form of government disability aid they wouldn’t have supported you. But I hear ya about obsessive thoughts. We’ll make it.
174325482,"“I’ve decided that I hate living with schizophrenia.” Welcome to the club :^) I think that most people who suffer from schizophrenia don’t like it. “I feel like a black sheep in my family now. I just visited my brothers and realized how much of an outcast of the family I am” Not liking social gatherings, even with close family is pretty normal when you have schizophrenia, I hate them. Personally I just meet people one or two at a time (including family) and I avoid big gatherings. “I am going to be stuck living at home on disability for the rest of my life.” Yes schizophrenia can’t be cured, but you can recover from the symptoms of it and live a good life if you’re prepared to try. “I’ll never have big money” Debatable but you’re probably right. Most of the people on this planet don’t have big money so why beat yourself up over it!? Money is relevant but it really isn’t everything. “I never feel like I used to,” Sorry to hear that. Change is part of life. Things 
never stay the same. If you feel bad now things can change in future so you’ll feel better. “A moment of joy is like finding a diamond.” That’s a good insight and very poetic. True, joy can sometimes be rare. It isn’t easy to find true joy in this life. “I try to stay positive” Good bro, keep trying :^) everyone has bad days. “I’m just tired of everything.” It’s good that you recognize that you’re fed up with your current circumstances. Now that you know that you’re fed up with them you can try to improve them if you want. “Sometimes life just doesn’t seem fair.” It isn’t, and it never has been."

I was entitled to supported housing as I have a ID but also have schizoaffective which in its nature isn’t as bad as schizophrenia as I have periods of wellness without negative symptoms where I am able to function normally but there is staff around for when I need the extra support when I become unwell. I really like supported living. I live with 2 other people who I consider my friends, it cheap bills and I get all my housing costs met by benefits which leave me with quite considerably disposable income. I always have company and we have some great staff. I have also become friends with a few old staff who have left the company and we meet for lunch and coffee quite often. Me and my housemate ha

175884011,Because none of it makes any sense. For example: If they wanted you for a double for the north korean dictator why would they wait 11 years or whatever your number of years was? Why do they need a double for the dictator in the first place? Why pick someone who doesn’t speak the language? Why not pick someone in their own population as a double as they would have easier access to them? It was a voice that told you this if I remember correctly which clearly points to Schizophrenia or some similar condition which is a condition that causes delusions also. You also thought your boyfriend was the devil. Another clue that you have psychosis. I could go on and on but the main point is your delusion doesn’t make any sense.

I’ve heard some people here say theirs wears off after a few weeks and get it earlier …perhaps you could talk to your psychiatrist about it. Paranoia is a difficult one. One I’ve had to deal with a lot. I hope you get this sorted. If you don’t go to the hospital just try to remind yourself it’s the illness and not reality.
175884036,They keep yelling at me that I am going to die soon. I have people messing with my mind so what is portrayed to people watching me is not a normal person. How can I make them leave me alone? The people who want me dead are all insane. I don’t want to talk to them let alone them watching me.
175884037,Yes I do. Talk to your psychiatrist. Tell them you’re still paranoid. Nothing bad is going to happen to you. You just have a paranoid feeling.
175884038,I hear you. I’m putting off going to the store myself. Try to talk myself into it.

For me I think praying triggers these voices but sometimes I also heard them when I wasn’t praying so not sure, for sure its the voice of my priest at church. Once I heard many priests praying on me, its that time that I tried to kill myself with an overdose."
175884053,I also believe thing will get better. The thing is how many more people will have to die? All the people who are sick and dying have family and they are I am sure quite upset over all this also. I know I cant control anything and I wish I could just turn of how I feel but it does not work that way for me. I overthink about all this and like others here I cant understand why people wont wear their masks. I have read story after story from people who said its fake or its something made to control population. Then the person or their loved ones get sick and then all of the sudden its real to them. Then they say oh my gosh how stupid I was. I dearly love people yet they do some of the dumbest things sometimes. The world we live in will never be the same. God have mercy on us
174325504,"I felt high all the time when without meds, its high dopamine. I never took drugs and felt high which made me grandiose. Many drug users, drugs increasing dopamine, become grandiose from drug use. Schizophrenic brains naturally have high dopamine. Its not a good thing."
175884054,"I am actively reaching out to both my boyfriend and mom, I am also keeping my therapist in the loop. I have been using a higher dose of my olanzapine and it is helping. I have been reaching out to my friends as well a bit. When I'm in this state it is difficult to be around others because they don't understand what I'm feeling. Because of the distractions I get overwhelmed, I begin to go through moods rapidly which makes it really difficult to hold the tone of a conversation. It makes me feel as if I am already alone, and I just want to get away from all stimulation. These symptoms I have aren't as scary as they are anxiety evoking. They are just so intense, I use to have a lot of paranoia and threats but have learned to not be afraid. It's closer to being highly annoying and frustrating. I think taking the medication will help, and today I feel much less involved in my mind. Things are feeling more clear, I just need to keep taking my meds at full dose and see how that goes. This morning is good, 
right now it's day by day. I'm hoping that if I can stay relaxed for a while my brain chemistry can get a chance to reorganize. It's one day at a time, I need to make sure I'm taking the higher dose right now and see how that does. Thanks for your words I appreciate them, it can be difficult talking to loved ones because they worry about me. My emotions and moods are directly related to these episodes, so when my family worries about me I worry about them, so this is very helpful!"

Yes its definitely an illness for sure. Don’t worry about the meds. They are just to help us over a difficult time and to make it a bit easier for us I guess because we are ill at the end of the day.

Plus after your surgery with hormone changes things can happen and depending on your age. So it isn't always the medication.

Apeirophobia is what it’s called. Luckily, for me, this fear went away after being put on antipsychotics. Weird, right? It shouldn’t have happened.

175884118,"Wrote answer without realizing its the SzPD forum, so sorry if its offtopic... Ive been diagnosed with NPD/Dissociative NOS and SPD/NPD. I had 1 year CBT and aborted it because i found it crap and I'm 2 years in psychodynamic therapy now. I had been smoking weed 24/7 for 15 years. Never going out, not being creative, not doing much except for being high, masturbating while imagining raping people and playing videogames. When I entered CBT my speech patterns consisted mostly of fillers heh. My main complaint was always that I dont feel emotions, as I ""lost"" that ability in my early 20s. In that regard no progress has been made. My current therapist and I are at odds in this regard though as he thinks that the absence of emotions has their reasons and its better to work on other stuff [first]. I'm still not interested in people per se. Its hard to figure out though if that is even a problem, or if that is a side-effect of the dissociative/phobic issues that I have. I am getting somewhat aware thoug
h of a wish for a partner. I am planning to see if I can start dating maybe next year. I do need a lot of cueing though, like I am enjoying a current tv show that kind of activates this in me - it might vanish when the show is over. While this only scratches this a bit, its kind of an issue with my therapy, too. I dont feel any kind of relationship to the therapist; there seem to be some transference things going on but it is all practically invisible to me and seems to come and go, with a lot of going and not a lot of coming. More coming though than originally so who knows. Well that kind of asks for something in the future, but I think alone time is essential. From what I know though I'm the most withdrawn person on the whole forum though, or at least in the top 3. So for me going to the grocery store regularly, going to a therapist, having a little contact with my neighbours etc. and sometimes writing something ""personal"" in forums like this one could be seen as progress. If of course this progress is ca
usally connected to therapy is not clear, nor do I personally consider it progress. I've also started cooking, I'm producing music on a regular and pretty high quality basis, I've stopped smoking weed and cigarettes, dissociatively blanking out less in therapy... all of which also isn't feeling like progress. I think an interesting part of this question is that it implies a black/white thing where there might be more of a complex. What I realize for example is that I am more caring and empathetic than many people in my family. So the first thing that comes to mind here is not necessarily that something became more ""normal"", whatever that means, but that I might realize that other people are actually more unnormal than I thought - or an overall ability to get more differentiated perspective on people and things. The most obvious change maybe from unnormal to normal would be certain kinds of paranoia that decreased or even vanished, like being in a store and thinking everyone is looking at me. Its not gone th
ough, it seems to reduce in some areas and in others its still around. I dont like crowds. That inability sadly is part of my dissociative problem, so no. I need to buy a new PC soon, but enthusiasm wouldn't be the right word for it. There are blips of it maybe, but mostly the disconnect from agency and reality is still there even in something that for my everyday leisire and work is going to be a big plus."

175884130,Going skiing. Theres like 1-2ft of snow. Woke up this morning feeling apathetic and irritated - idk why. My doctor is going to call me tomorrow about filling the vyvanse early. I have enough until Saturday and was supposed to take 30mg a day for 7 days and 2x 30mg a day for 21 days - But I could only take the 30mg for two days because I started to get Parkinson's symptoms from the antipsychotic. I also woke up early to go skiing so there were a total of 4 days that I took 3x 30mg a day but I still slept early. I hope he understands. I decided to just keep taking 2x 30mg every morning two weeks ago and it's been fine ever since. I had depersonalization and derealization after the first morning that I took 2x 30mg in the 27th of December 2020 so I took one in the morning and one at noon on the 28th - Then just decided to take both in the morning after that and the DR/DR was gone and I haven't had it since. I was so used to taking 3x dexedrine a day but now it's ok. I'm scared if I ever have to withdra

175884131,"One such coincidence: I noticed in my group zoom chat that lots of people took vitamins last night and got insomnia. The weather was very messed up yesterday I felt like the world was venting, or clearing out stress, and releasing toxins. So I am hopeful that I can stop predicting my own words, and know my will and know you also have a will and mind. I am not alone on planet earth. But I feel as if I am the only one in existence that has a conscience, that is aware. I was relaxing in the sunshine, and resting my head on the grass–and the thoughts that inserted were–you have changed reality somehow, you have this that this that, no one else can see like you…or I have this awareness that has been lost to others. Then I thought how if my awareness is some lost awareness, ancient, mysticism, whatever it may be that is my awareness–what is my awareness? How do you locate perception…where do you find the source of time…second revelation is… Is time a contingent continuum line, or on a narro
w line, like forward pressed–or do we spin dance and spiral out, like infinite spirals, or a spiral dance or something…or are we a layered reality, some—thing—a layered layer of layers on layers…how would you discern one layer if you believed that the layer you are in, is “the norm” or the right way to do things. Is behavioral medicine just mind-screwing people because I feel mind-screwed sometimes… anyways, no one will understand and people will just remark: “have you slept, you sound nuts, get away from me, crazy, make no sense, freak, take your pills, just snap out of it, its just a coincidence” No it’s not its my freaking life."

175884133,"Hi, my name is _NAME_. I’ve been on and off in a relationship with a loved one who has depression. We found out only two years ago about a brain tumor that caused this. On top of that there has been a lot of emotional damage caused by his family growing up which only added to his depression and anxiety. When he was diagnosed with depression I did everything I could to learn about it and help. However, living in different states for the past three years made things more difficult and harder for me to physically support him. He had been getting worse, and I feel I have noticed a pattern when it does (around February-March). When COVID hit, I lost my job and I spiraled in fear. He broke up with me again two days later. I am heartbroken and even myself was diagnosed with depression shortly after my job loss. I’ve been in counseling to help with the depression. In a way I’m glad to know what it is like but I’m just wishing there was more I could’ve done for my guy. I keep believing in his heal
ing and just pray we can reconnect. I hate this mental health illness for everyone because I see what it can do to people and those who love them."

I know it's easier said than done, but it beats getting stressed. I agree that we should all work together. It angers me to no end that you have people not wearing masks and not taking it seriously. I really believe that a lot of people are just selfish and won't change until they get it or lose a love one to it. However, we can't control others, just focus on our actions.

175884158,I recently had the same thought of the show. That everyone knew everything I was doing and just acted normal because they didn’t believe it was real or was too scared to say anything. Im on meds now but still think when I get off of them that they can see what I see and hear what I hear and even feel what I feel. It got to the point I thought it was quantum entanglement like what _PERSON_ called spookey action at a distance.

175884195,Thank you _NAME_ and super20dan for your replies
175884196,"I am very worried about you. Would you be willing to post a thumbs up or anything just so we will know you are still with us, please? I apologise ahead of time for this post being so long I am desperately hoping that my story might bring you at least a little bit of of hope. It's straight forward and I didn't say any of those things people so often say when they feel awkward because they don't know what to say. Most of us can relate to feeling like that at least once in our lives. All I am asking is for you to give it a chance. I won't be offended if you don't find any value in it. We are all different and what has worked for me may not work for you. I am deeply sorry for what you are going through. Losing a child is one of the most painful things we can go through in life. I lost my daughter 40 years ago and she is always with me - always. During the 20 years that followed the loss of my daughter I attempted suicide at least 10 times. During those 20 years I made the worst decisions a girl could m
ake, always putting myself in danger in hopes someone would do the job I kept failing at. I became an insomniac because if I fell asleep I would have brutality intense dreams of going through the labor process and always at the end of labor, they would take my daughter away and I never got to see her. The dreams felt so real that when I woke up my stomach would burn with pain, the way it might feel if you did 100 sit-ups more than you ever did before. I got into drugs for a few years and was one of the lucky ones - I woke up one day and just decided to put them down and walk away. Do to stupid teenage choices, I found myself pregnant at 17 with my highschool sweetheart's baby. We were together almost 3 years and had planned on getting married after highschool. He conveniently forgot about those plans the moment I told him I was pregnant. My father got wind of it and promptly informed me I would be having an abortion within a couple of days. The death of my daughter is different from the death of your son and 
I am not going to tell you that mine hurts worse than yours or vice versa. That really isn't important. I can tell you that I grew up in the Catholic Church and went to their school. I went to church service every day by my own choice. It was my safe place. Unfortunately, growing up Catholic, it was drilled into my head that abortion was murder. Period. I lived with extreme guilt for 25 + years. I had no reason to live because my tiny baby was in heaven and I truly believed God would never be able to forgive me therefore my fate was sealed. I could not understand why God would not let me die and some of my attempts were very serious. There is a reason I'm telling you ALL these details. My belief system tells me that God has a purpose for each and every one of us and today I believe I know why he wouldn't let me die. It's okay if your belief system is different from mine. I am just hoping you can get something out of my tragedy that might help you see a little light at the end of the tunnel. Here is was I do k
now. Counseling is almost not optional for you at this point. What type of counseling you need is up to you. You can see a counselor, have counseling sessions with a preacher or perhaps start off by joining a bereavement group. I URGE you to seek out something immediately. You can't do this by yourself and that's okay. I'm not suggesting you dive headlong into this next one. You have to get some healing done in your own spirit before you can try this - if you even decide you might be interested. I found that my life remained in a constant tailspin until I decided I needed to find a way to honor my daughter and give some sort of meaning to her loss. I was blessed with the opportunity to foster four children , (all siblings but not all at once) and I have had custody of my nephew for the last 9 1/2 years. It helped me find something positive come out of my tragedy. My husband had known the younger kids their entire lives and the two older ones since the were 3 and 4. They little one's were 7 and 9 when we got t
hem. I had met them a couple of times. It gave me great comfort and peace knowing they wouldn't be with strangers who could have potentially abused them. My nephew will be 18 in November and he is a huge blessing to me. If you will take that giant step towards healing through counseling and put some hard work into it, then perhaps you could find something that will allow you to honor your son and make him very proud of you. You might find meaning in mentoring at risk youth or another option might be creating some sort of community support for fathers who for whatever reason are not very present in their kids lives. You might be the only person to reach out to them (in a VERY nonjudgmental way, of course) and help them get the obstacles torn down which are keeping them from being present. Just imagine how many lives you could touch in honor of your son. It won't be an easy road and I won't sugar-coat it. Committing suicide won't help him in any way and your parents and siblings would be forever burdened by you
r decision. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It also feels like the ultimate F*** you to our loved ones who are left to pick up the pieces."

175884213,Just out of curiosity what of other mental illnesses such as PTSD or psycho somatic symptom disorder? Would those show up too. I was too young to work at my sickest but I couldn’t handle school so even if I were older a job wouldnt be an option. This is because of PTSD which in turn caused psychosis that wasnt actually psychosis. My brain/body started doing it as a sort of defense mechanism against severe PTSD. So it was like pseudo-psychosis yet still kept me from functioning.

175884230,"It reminded me of several severe cases that I had. First. It happened during winter 2015-2016 (maybe 2016-2017, doesn’t matter). I walk on an empty street of a calm small town at a winter evening. At some point I notice a pedestrian way ahead of me. They walk my way on the same side of the street. I pay it no mind. Some time later we cross. Then, suddenly, that pedestrian jumps on me! I blink in shock and confusion. There is noone there. The wide and long street is completely empty except for me. What made this case memorable to me is the fact that I saw that character for at least 20 meters away. I saw their shadow gradually come closer and heard footsteps. And yet they disappeared in front of my eyes. Second. It happened in broad daylight summer 2020. I eat some sauteed zucchinis. I lazily dig in with a fork, moving a slice in the deep bowl. Suddenly, a white spider-like creature quickly skitters out of the bowl, then crawls on my arm. I spit out the food, start to cough, yell curses and try to 
crush the tiny creature with my other arm. In the confusion, the creature disappears. At first I thought that I killed it. But after I calmed down I found no corpse."

While symptom improvement is frequently robust, when other domains are considered outcomes are generally poorer. We explored response trajectories, rates and predictors of recovery in the domains of core psychopathology, clinician-rated social and occupational functioning and patient-rated quality of life over 24 months of treatment in 98 patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders who were treated with a long-acting antipsychotic medication. There was robust improvement in core psychopathology (effect size d?=?3.36) and functionality (d?=?1.78), with most improvement occurring within the first six months of treatment. In contrast, improvement in subjec
tive quality of life was less marked (d?=?0.37) and slower, only reaching significance after 12 months of treatment. Symptom remission was achieved by 70% of patients and over half met our criteria for functional remission and good quality of life. However, only 29% met the full criteria for recovery. Patients who met the recovery criteria had better premorbid adjustment, were less likely to be of mixed ethnicity and substance use emerged as the only modifiable predictor of recovery. Only 9% of our sample achieved both functional remission and good quality of life despite not being in symptom remission. We found high rates of symptom remission, functional remission and good quality of life in patients, although relatively few achieved recovery by meeting all three of the outcome criteria. Symptom remission is not a necessary prerequisite for functional remission and good quality of life, although few non-remitters achieve other recovery criteria."

I feel like I'll spend my whole life being analytical just to find out that all I needed to do was live - And reconnect with my spirit. That's what my doctor says.. He just wants me to have control to be happy with my medications and then just exercise, go to school, enjoy life, laugh, love, live. It's that simple. But I'm like a philosopher. What puts me off about philosophy is that it's so ancient and people have written down philosophical ideas and died a long time ago. I feel that it's hard to idolize someone. The few people that I do have inspired me so much with art and inventions. I'm tired of talking about how aware I've become - But I have so much time left to go still.

The next 6 months were an ordeal because I did not know what was happening and during the day I could not breathe and I was dizzy, almost every night I hand a panic attack and I thought that after falling asleep I thought I was going to die. Every night, every time I drove, I thought I was going to have an accident + a lot of other things. I still didn't know what I hand until after 6 months I dreamed that my teeth were falling out and I searched the meaning of this dream on google and I read that I may have anxiety discorders and I saw that the dream is my salvation. I went to the psychiatrist where he offered me some pills for treatment, but I noticed that because of these pills it is harder for me to think and when I d

It only took six days of being stuck before the scale moved again. I let it get me upset, but in hindsight, it wasn’t such a big deal. I eat in a calorie range where I should be losing two pounds per week, but because of the Zyprexa wanting to put weight on me, I only lose one pound per week.

175884307,"if you really enjoy your job then maybe there is someone at work you can trust enough to try and resolve these issues, on a similar note the problem between you and your wife could be better aired in a family/marriage counselling session but if that is not an option then it may just be trying to find the courage to talk about the whole thing openly with those concerned, i wouldnt like to see you lose your job and your family just because you didnt feel valued enough as an individual."

175884312,"The term “rock & roll” actually came from a slang term from the 1950’s for having sex. Rockin and _NAME_. Revolution #9 was just _NAME_ and _PERSON_. And largely influenced by _PERSON_. She did all kinds of crazy stuff like that. She can’t sing a lick but if you’re the wife of one of the best musicians in history who’s in the most popular and influential bands ever, you’re going to get on a record. And this is off topic but by the time the Beatles were doing the White Album they were slowly breaking up as a band and more interested in doing their own thing instead of collaborating with each other. So a lot of those songs were each ones pet projects and they often recorded them either without each other or they were just done by one or two Beatles. You’re right, there’s a lot of innuendo in rock lyrics, it’s nothing new. The writers often put sexual innuendo in their songs often just as an inside joke but to see if their fans pick up on it and a lot of times just for their own am
usement and to see what they could get away with and slip by the censors."
175884313,_AT_MENTION_ You should really up your meds! Post some of your art?
175884314,Thanks guys. I think just being able to talk it out has helped a lot. I’m going to try sleeping again now.
175884315,For some reason I'm no longer allowed to charge my own batteries. I'm going to have to ask them to charge it tonight and I know they're not going to bother to use the external battery charger. I'm so sick to death of this place. There's a nurse's aid who wakes my roommate up by yelling really nasty at her. I suspect this aide is also responsible for more than one lost item recently. The good bottle of Vapewild I ordered just a couple of weeks ago is gone along with a pack of coils. I could kill whoever took them. I feel like I should stand up for my roommate but I don't want to start or be in the middle of some rotten drama here with that aide. It feels like a Sunday today and tomorrow is Sunday. No relief until Monday. I can't take the constant theft here anymore. I don't want to be here another year or more. I'm daf and I don't know what to do.
175884316,Cool. Thanks for the tip!

There’s not much to be done about negative symptoms that aren’t related to depression, and as far as I’m aware, negatives don’t destroy the brain in the same way that positives do. note: I’m not trying to start an argument. I’m just trying to be better about giving people the benefit of the doubt."
175884362,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_ , hope you have a better day too."
175884363,"You made the first step. Realizing this is so hard but you CAN overcome this. Through my experience, which is similar to yours, it's most often rooted in your childhood. Did your parents divorce early? Did you have an absent parent? These sort of things cause us to reach out for a replacement for that person. I would highly recommend seeking out a therapist. We tend to try to deal with things like this how we used to as children. Obviously those mechanisms no longer work as adults and we need to learn how to deal with them in different ways. A therapist is well equipped to help you change those habits and ways of thinking. You'll get through it!"

I’m still in the process. The paperwork is overwhelming for me. I hope I don’t get denied. It will be really hard. My diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. I want to work and will go back as soon as I can. I recommend you work as long as you can! I was forced to stop. The void is unbearable at times. I miss the people I worked with, I miss being productive, I miss having money to spend, I miss feeling accomplished, I miss having somewhere to go every day. Being home is awful."

174325590,"yeah, I worry about how I look too. I think it’s part of gettting older, everyone is conforming to ideals of how we should look. But when you’ve been through something tough you kinda know that there’s not point. yet people judge us for that. I am sometimes motivated to exercise for the sake of my looks but most of the time can’t be bothered. I do shamatha mediation. (meditation focusing on the breath) which extends into vipassana (awareness of breathe as a balance point, as well as emotions, thoughts and the enviromnment) more like a more open minded focus on the breath. I think it keeps me calmer and occasionally I expereince compassion for myself suffering in schizophrenia. Oh yeah, non fiction books are always handy to read. A good fiction book is ‘world without end’ by ken follet. I like a few other ones that I mostly forget, but I know ‘ana of california’ was one of them.

175884369,"You need to create your own thread for advise like before and comment only in that, instead of spamming the forum with multiple posts. You are asking the same questions multiple times. You either A. don’t want to accept the answers or B. You are forgetting what answers you’ve gotten in the past. If A, I’m sorry if you are struggling in accepting your diagnosis. Fortunately, your medical team and those physically in your life know more about you and your diagnosis than us random strangers on the internet. You need to try to think that if multiple people in your life are telling you something, there may be a grain of truth to what they are saying. Questioning yourself at this stage of your diagnosis is normal and healthy. But you will need to put trust in your doctors and family at some point or things will not get better for you. You might not get worse, but you will not get better until you accept treatment and that you need help, even if you don’t know what that might be. If B, it is bette

At what point do we as humans start creating problems consciously or subconsciously to appease economic strain and try to appease the need for availability of increased standard of living?"

I told him I really didnt want to get on the boat while they did that, because they will basically be intoxicated. He got upset and said ""you should live a little"" and then said ""dont go then if ur just gonna stay in the cabin"". Am I wrong or is he wrong?"

175884401,"Hey man, I don’t know if this helps, but I’ve had SZ for a quarter century. The two words I regularly use to describe the early years are UNRELENTING TERROR. In my case it was all aliens all the time. I was convinced they were going to vivisect me alive at some point (after the mental nanobot torture, naturally). Everyone was spying on me and listening in on me because I knew what was going on. After medication and therapy I developed insight, I got healthier, I became more like my old self. and I got a life back (careers, wife, kid, home, etc.). As grim as things are for you now, there’s still a fantastic potential future ahead of you. Best advice I can give you is this: Ignore the voices. They’re not real, they’re just noise. The only power they have over you is the power you give them. Put your energy into recovery. Stop worrying about whose voices are saying what. That’s not important. Going for a walk, having a coffee in a cafe, reading a book. That’s important. Do that instead."

I still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night but don’t seem to get a sinus headache as often and usually fall back asleep after awhile if I don’t take any caffeine. I usually take one or two gummies in the evening. They seem more gentle than the melatonin I was taking and way better on my heart than the valium the doctor prescribed.

175884426,Thanks but my tastes are maturing and I’m starting to enjoy sweetened coffee. Like caramel macchiatos and stuff. Not something too bitter… lots of _USER_ID_ shops still growing in number in Honolulu so lots to try! Some _USER_ID_ shops sell _USER_ID_ coffee which definitely hits the spot lol. I also like the matcha shakes too. :3 you need to come try some!!! I might venture into the _NAME_ territory too one day maybe when I feel adventurous… but there’s a _USER_ID_ shop right downstairs from my Bridges support group that sells Hong Kong milk tea and I need to acquire a taste for it since it’s the most authentic place. The support group people seem jealous since I’m always holding a sugar drink in class lol when they’re trying to have a serious discussion.

(I might have been too into the topic of ‘power’ as a youth, but I straightened it out, really did grow up.) Anyway deep down I knew I was innocent - but I thought I was being framed. The pattern was I would do or say something in my life, and bad guys would do something a trillion fold in society, so that the populous would eventually resent me, and want me to go away. It was severe, I actually thought of my smoking as a bargain so that nobody would reach for me and actually effect my demise.

I had a bipolar friend in the psych ward and he told me about a story of driving a car with a plastic machine gun and sunglasses. Too high of a dose can make you feel like you're in a Grand Theft Auto game. He could have been shot. 30-50mg is good once every 1-2 weeks.

175884471,"_AT_MENTION_ . From what you’ve written, you hurt your friend and you feel bad about that. Consider apologizing to your friend for hurting them. This is really independent of whether you feel you were right or wrong – it’s about acknowledging that you hurt your friend. It’s a sign of strength and integrity to consider the other person’s point of view and feelings, not a sign of weakness or insincerity. This is an important lesson to learn both in your personal life and in your professional interactions (e.g., at school, at work, etc.). I’ll be honest with you, one of the biggest red flags when I’m working with and mentoring employees on the job is when they do not understand this. I work in a STEM field with highly educated people, and it seems like the career-limiting factor(s) are almost never technical ability, but rather lack of awareness about the importance of “emotional intelligence”. In my experience, I’ve noticed that this can disproportionately affect highly intelligen
t and/or highly educated people. I’m not really sure why this is, but I’m guessing it may be that people who are highly intelligent or who have become subject matter experts in their field (through study or work) make the erroneous assumption that this means they are experts in all subjects and in life experience, in general."

175884527,"_PERSON_, I am right there with you. This past July I had my first panic attack and have been struggling with panic attacks/anxiety ever since. I lost 20lbs. In a month and a half. Nothing hurts more than being around co-workers/friends who say things like ""wish I could lose weight like that."" It's been absolutely debilitating as I've obsessed like a hypochondriac that I have a million different health ailments that have gone undiagnosed. I've gone to the doctor and had multiple tests done to trying to determine what was wrong with me. They've assured me nothing is wrong but here I am trapped in the prison cells of my mind believing there is something that they just didn't catch. I've been seeing a counselor now for five weeks at the behest of my mother and wife. My mother is always suffered from depression and anxiety. I'm inclined to think that I've always suffered with depression but just not ever able to put a label on why I felt the way I felt. Please know you're not alone. Myself and countl
ess others are in that same boat with you. And when you're not able to row any longer, We will row for you until you have the strength to row again. Please make sure to reach out to someone as well. Don't make my mistake of being too proud and too ""strong"" to need therapy/counseling. It's okay to not be okay. And it takes courage and resilience to seek out help."

174325618,"It serious tempts me to quit my meds sometimes. Even though, I doubt that would help. It’s probably mostly Sz negative symptoms. I use to enjoy movies, pc games, even Tv to some extent…not anymore. Life is just one big boring pile of ????. lol. Anhedonia is the worst of the Sz negative symptoms IMO. No joy in life is awful.

And as for the kids, have you educated them about bipolar symptoms and the disease itself? The more that they know the better. Remember you can't control this as much as you would most likely want to. And I am sorry about your marriage. It is difficult to deal with at times. But it really is up to the person to get help. I am sorry you are going through this. I hope that things get better. Hang in there... Hugs, _NAME_..."

I know one woman that made that her choice, and she had all of her family and loved ones around her when she passed away. Apparently it is quite kind and gentle. You have to add it to your living will of course, so that if you were incapable at the time with dementia, you have already given your permission to take your life if that’s what you were asking for. I know, kind of a dark subject, but there are times when such a way is just the better choice. She was in a great deal of pain with cancer, and had simply had all she could take"

There's many people that aren't freaking out - Because they look at it in a different way. It's like depression.. Some people are positive and others have low self esteem. It's all in the mind... Listen to the voice in the back of your mind that is telling you what you should really do - Notice that you ""HAVE"" to do a paper. ""Why can't I do it later when I feel better?"" you say.. That day will never come in time unless you listen to the voice. You might want to go outside and scream or quietly tell people how you really feel - Anything.. A lot of people use cigarettes to do it - To go outside for a smoke because it's socially acceptable and appealing in the movies. Society is testing us. School is testing us. Just have faith in yourself. Procrastination is a *****."

But that’s also from years of abusing it. Not abusing directly but just eating bad, not exercising, my weight going up and down severely due to being off and on meds when I was real sick, drinking, all these piercings I have, not really just my ears, and just overall not taking care of my myself due to psychosis and negative symptoms. I was just telling him I need a push up bra cuz my chest is like going to the ground and my chest used to be on my chest up high when I was in high school. Lmao."
175884603,"I was talking to a friend last year and he said he has problems finishing things but easy to start things. I said that I have problems starting things but no problem finishing things. But tbh I also have problems finishing things cuz of cognitive fatigue. I plan on doing brain games because when I was walking with my mom and her bf yesterday, I realized, - ""Do people in the mall think that my moms bf is my dad?"" and I realized that looking at families walking in the mall, a lot of the time, a dad might be a step dad and a mom might be a step mom. Or the kid/kids could be adopted. I believe training my brain to solve problems will allow me to be more creative and think outside the box. I like to flirt with psychosis sometimes to do that but I'm telling my psychiatrist to bring my Invega injection back to 3 weeks instead of every 4 weeks. Podcasts changed my life. I plan on doing so many things and there's many things that I can do (Including exercise - I'm going hiking tomorrow.. So I guess I exer
cise moderately like mountain biking, skiing, going to the gym, taking walks, etc) but I need something to stimulate my brain constantly to motivate me (Vyvanse, reaching the top of a mountain.. something to work towards). I want to go to school to become a biochemist like my cousin and pharmacologist. But I won't use those things on their own. I want to learn how to write better and then write books. So I'll probably sign up for a philosophy course soon just to get my mind sharp. I can't smoke weed if I want my mind sharp but idk.. I found studying anthropology hard because there was so much reading but my mind will get better with time. I procrastinate a lot. I read slightly and most of the things I do are on the internet like learning how to make money in the future, learning about investments like bitcoin and blockchain. I was teaching myself how to code at one point and hack. But really I just start one thing, then stop and go towards something else. I try to build skills all the time but burn out with a
ll the information I'm absorbing. I spend time reading articles on flipboard cuz it has like 100 topics.. But I never stick to one topic which is why I was thinking about liberal arts.. I feel like things get me nowhere. And all this started just 2 years ago after my intense psychedelic trip. If I don't know what an English word means, I look it up. When I have a weird thought, I google it and go down the rabbit hole. I reward myself with laziness too much like ""I'll listen to music and write"".. I only started writing prose creative writing after my psychosis. Before that, I was dead inside and hated everything. Lately I've been teaching myself how to draw. I remember drawing when I was like 12. I played guitar when I was 14. I never stuck with anything. I don't see the light sometimes. Nothing inspired me in the past. Now I'm constantly looking for inspiration to have motivation, happiness and well being. Physical hygiene is ok. I shower once a week but I brush my teeth every morning, shave, gel my hair ju
st for something to do and make my bed etc, clean my room before it gets too messy. And I can't be alone anymore or else I go nuts. I need constant social interaction now (Having coffee with people), talking to strangers. I put a section in my notes called ""Self improvement"". I have to learn skills or else my brain will rot. I get so depressed because it's really really hard for me to function with doing a variety of things and absorbing information. I plan on getting another part time job which will make me think about time being more precious and also putting a bit more stress on me. I think about my future a lot because I want to be able to be comfortable and travel the world. I hate being in the same place. Part of my problem is that my surroundings are so small and I feel claustrophobic. Even the mountains make me feel closed in because I can't see the horizon. I look at the big picture too much. I don't pay attention to detail. I can't be comfortable to start going into youtube videos or netflix even 
though there's so many interesting things out there to watch but I feel like I'm neglecting everything else. To FOCUS is to IGNORE everything else. I can't focus."

175884624,"I was being tongue-in-cheek. But I will make an observation: you often use the argument “you’re aren’t special, you’re just like everyone else”. Don’t you believe anyone is special at all? If you don’t that’s fine, at least it would be consistent and it could philosphically buttressed with relative ease -either on “folksy” grounds (“ultimately we are all the same”) or more scientific sounding (“we don’t choose our genes or circumstances at birth” etc). But if you do, then it would require additional explanation, otherwise it just sounds like you’re judging people according to a private and perhaps non-transferable set of criteria."

I was on gabapentin restless legs anxious feeling but eventually made me to point couldn’t sit still eat. Invega raises prolactin so does cause Weight gain from just medicine. I lost 12lbs but think once prolactin lowers can lose more weight. Invega can also cause heart problems and diabetes. Gabapentin can cause fluid retention cause heart problems. I enjoy hobbies more off invega. I’m on straterra now helps focus some and maybe less restless but can cause sleep more during day. I’m looking into adderall and lamictal

When buying the bottle of coke, the woman at the counter was counting change and I had to stand there not knowing what to do. I walked back, deep breaths and then got home and took a benzo to try and go to bed but then it got worse until it kicked in. When I started feeling better, I smoked CBD flower which made me feel even more better and now I'm drinking chamomile tea.

Eighty-five of these subjects were followed during the next 6 months. Cardiovascular risk/protection factors were measured in plasma and co-variated by sociodemographic/clinical characteristics. Multiple linear regression models detected the change of each biological marker from baseline to follow-up in relation to clinical scales, antipsychotic medication, and pro-/antiinflammatory mediators.Glycosylated hemoglobin is a state biomarker in first episode of psychosis follow-up patients and 
inversely correlated to the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. We found opposite alterations in the levels of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in first episode of psychosis baseline conditions compared with control that were absent in the first episode of psychosis follow-up group. Adiponectin levels decreased in a continuum in both pathological time points studied. E-Selectin plasma levels were inversely related to total antipsychotic equivalents and adiponectin levels inversely co-related to the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Finally, adiponectin levels were directly related to antiinflammatory nuclear receptor PPAR? expression in first episode of psychosis baseline conditions and to proinflammatory nuclear factor nuclear factor ?B activity in follow-up conditions, respectively.Our results support the need for integrating cardiovascular healthcare very early after the first episode of psychosis."

I knew it wouldn’t last and I was really, really too sick to even know what was going on. Very nice gesture of him though. He had a successful business for years. Made a ton of money. Not sure what happened to it all. I guess he lost it and “threw” and wasted all his money away over all the years. Never learned how to save, take care of things, or pay for things the right way. I come from a poor/middle class/working family background. No education. I was supposed to be the first one in my family to get a college degree – upward mobility thing. What a shame and disaster.

smoke and enjoy and tried pot but not sure why I experimented with _USER_ID_ of all things and other stuff. It was stupid. Very stupid. No one deserves their life uppended by schizophrenia. Not even people like me. So ya, I worked minimum wage jobs or slightly above minimum wage jobs my entire life preceeding schizophrenia/disability. All of it was temporary, part time, and crap. I had 3 jobs. My first job was during the “great recession” out of high school at a pizza place with no job experience or resume experience. Then I worked at Bed Bath and Beyond – Loved that, but the hours were too low and no benefits for 15-20 hours a week.

174325649,"This is very interesting. Taken together, our results provide evidence that, in adult LgDel+/ mice, PVneurons are present in normal numbers and might not be physiologically abnormal, but their recruitment through excitation is markedly reduced. This is reflected in chronic low-PV plasticity specifically in early-born PV neurons, failure to effectively inhibit PN firing, and failure to induce high-PV plasticity upon chemogenetic activation of PV neurons or learning. We then carried out D2R antagonist treatments aimed at the vH or dorsal hippocampus (dH) during a P60–P70 time window and monitored possible long-term consequences on PV neuron recruitment and plasticity. Remarkably, single delivery of a D2R antagonist every second day from P60–P70 to the vH (vCA3/CA1) produced long-lasting and brain-wide rescue of PV expression levels in LgDel+/ mice (Figures 4A and S5). Comparable rescue of PV expression values was achieved with haloperidol or with the more specific D2R antagonist eticlopride (Figu
res 4A and S5). Consistent with long-lasting rescue of PV excitatory recruitment, treated adult mice exhibited no signs of chronic lowPV plasticity, including nearly WT-level PV expression in earlyborn PV neurons and excitatory synaptic punctum densities onto PV neurons (Figures 4B and 4C). Furthermore, inhibitory neuron firing frequencies and activation, PN inhibition, and PV neuron plasticity upon chemogenetic activation of PV neurons were effectively restored in treated adult LgDel+/ mice (Figures 4D and S5). Finally, treated LgDel+/ mice exhibited fear memory and corresponding high-PV plasticity indistinguishable from WT mice upon cFC (Figure S5). To more clearly define the conditions required to achieve longlasting rescue of PV neuron recruitment in LgDel+/ mice, we carried out a series of additional experiments. In contrast to D2R antagonist treatments aimed at the vH, the same treatment aimed at the dH did not rescue PV expression distributions in adult LgDel+/ mice, either locally or system-wide (Figu
re S5). It sounds as though this is very time sensitive: P60 by the way is post natal day 60, meaning the mice are 60 days old. That corresponds roughly to 20 years in humans, but it’s difficult to make that comparison exactly. I don’t know how many years 10 days of mouse lifespan translates to human years, but probably a couple years at least. D2R antagonist treatments to the vH from P60–P64 were ineffective, whereas treatments from P60–P66 were as effective as from P60–P70 (Figure S5). Comparable treatments during a P70–P80 time window were much less effective, and 10-day treatments started before P55 or after P75 were ineffective (Figure S5). In further experiments, a D2R antagonist delivered systemically within the P60–P70 time window was as effective as local treatment in the vH, suggesting that similar interventions could be tested in a clinical setting (Figure S5). Taken together, these results define a sensitive time window between P60 and P75 when repeated vH treatments with a D2R antag
onist produce long-lasting, system-wide rescue of chronic low-PV plasticity as well as of PV neuron recruitment and plasticity in LgDel+/ mice. It’s also important to note that these mice were a specific genetic model for SZ, one with adult onset. In people of course there are many different potential genetic causes. Perhaps many of these also relate to the PV interneurons. PV interneuron dysfunction seems to be a core piece of the puzzle - this is also the interneuron type Dr _PERSON_ was studying with the stem cell transplants. I don’t know, but it’s testable in people if they can figure out how to fairly accurately determine who is at risk for schizophrenia. They’re not going to treat asymptomatic 18, 20, 22 year olds with APs, even every other day, for several years just on the off chance they might later develop schizophrenia. There will have to be an accurate predictive screening tool - which I do think will someday be developed, but it hasn’t been developed yet."

For example with me, I was unmedicated for about 10 months, before I was medicated. And right now I’m doing OK-ish on a low dose. So there’s no absolute. Having said that, when I come off medication I relapsed. So, it’s hard to tell what I should have done differently, impossible to tell, actually. Alls I know is I can try to reduce my risk of bad symptoms by listening to what my pdoc says and journals."

Once they make that choice, it’s THEIR responsibility that it happened. I was raped. I didn’t tell anyone for years because I was worried they’d say it was my own fault. I blamed myself. I still don’t like being called a victim. It happened, and I can’t change that. No amount of self-blame will undo what happened."

They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms. However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms. The deficits in cognition are seen to drive the negative psychosocial outcome in schizophrenia, and are claimed to equate to a possible reduction in IQ from the norm of 100 to 70–85. Cognitive deficits may be of neurocognition (nonsocial) or of social cognition. Neurocognition is the ability to receive and remember information, and includes verbal fluency, memory, reasoning, problem solving, speed of processing, and auditory and visual perception. Verbal memory impairment is associated with a decreased level of semantic processing (relating meaning to words). Another memory impairm

A point of entry may be the glutamatergic system since glutamatergic dysregulation contributes to multiple psychiatric disorders. We evaluated the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the use of the glutamatergic drug riluzole in mental illnesses; and conducted preliminary _NAME_-analyses of its effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. A systematic search was performed using PubMed (Medline), Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PsycINFO. _NAME_-analyses were performed using Comprehensive _NAME_-Analysis soft
ware. Twenty-three RCTs were included for qualitative analysis and showed positive effects of adjunctive/monotherapy riluzole in patients with OCD, depression, autism, substance abuse and schizophrenia. Seven studies were also used for quantitative analysis, which revealed positive but non-significant effects on OCD and depression. Riluzole was generally well tolerated with few serious adverse events. The studies included in this systematic review were highly heterogeneous and the number of studies was limited per diagnostic condition. Moreover, few studies have examined riluzole as a single treatment. We suggest carrying out further work to provide definitive evidence for the benefit of riluzole in psychiatric illness."

When I took a full 7.5mg, I'd meditate before it kicked in and I'd fall asleep in 20 minutes - I'd get a nice drowsiness but I didn't really care because I usually feel good already lately - Even though I'm somewhat situationally depressed. Now it can take about an hour to fall asleep - But at least I sleep. During the days when I was more of an addict, I enjoyed a 0.5mg clonazepam after having a panic attack and being awake for 3 days due to anxiety. I melted into sleep.. I remember being in rehab and wishing to have that feeling again.. But I was prescribed a dangerous antipsychotic called ""Nozinan"" instead of something ""addictive"" - It was good because maybe I wasn't ready yet. I was too young, immature, traumatized, etc.. Ever since my bad trip, I mostly stopped abusing my meds and when I did, I did it extremely carefully. Now I've been prescribed 5 different benzos this year and haven't abused them - So I'm not dependent. 
The panic attacks were caused by the bad trip.. If I abuse benzos, how can they help me with panic? Fear and the more common sense that I have now is much stronger than pleasure for me. Awareness also overrides euphoria for me because I want to use substances that benefit me in the long term like the stimulant for example. I'd take an extra maybe 2-3 times a month but if I take as prescribed, I'm just more of an upper than downer person anyways. _NAME_ in his book ""PIHKAL"" says that he didn't like heroin because it made him unmotivated and not care about anything - And he needed to get work done!"

They are so self centered and never think of how terrifying they are and how they scare you when they interact with you. Father says it’s because they are terrified themselves and lost and confused. They are desperate for anyone to help them or to listen to them. And I understand that but at the same time I wish it wasn’t me that had to do it. Thinking back though going off my belief that souls basically choose their lives I could absolutely see myself nonchalantly agreeing to help lost souls move on while on my life journey, and if given the choice to live life again would probably agree to help out again despite how taxing and scary it can be because you are literally saving people’s souls by helping them move on and that is a big deal. All it takes on my part is courage and the willingness to work with my Father to guide them home. But I am often lacking the courage part… Anyways I am not sure if spirits wander their 
way to me or if Father sends them to me somehow but I can tell when they’re around because I can sense I’m not alone anymore, and I start getting bizarre, extremely vivid dreams where I am someone else or I am witnessing someone else and usually it is some traumatic event leading to death. These dreams recur over and over until I eventually help the spirit pass at which point they cease. Maybe helping spirits wouldn’t be so bad if all the spirits were nice and benevolent but they aren’t all like that. Plenty of really, really bad people are hanging around dead here too. I didn’t even know people could be so evil until I met some of these ghosts. And I am supposed to help them too even though these ones HURT me and terrorize me. It’s extremely difficult and that’s where I feel father is being unfair. Anyways. All this dealing with traumatized ghosts I feel has really braced me for the field of psychiatry.

175884887,"The problem comes from applying moral value to productivity. Someone who is capable of doing a lot of things is not morally superior to someone who has trouble doing things. There is a truth to the idea that you can force yourself into productive habits. I mean, I used to struggle hard with showering. I would shower once a week tops. Then I started dating Mr. Star, and he would kick me out of his bed if I smelled. Never had trouble showering again, because I knew the penalty of not showering was greater than the discomfort of making myself shower. But by the same token, there are days where I can sit and stare at my schoolwork for 4 hours straight with no distractions, and do zero assignments. Not because I just need to try harder. Because I’m paralyzed with the fear of doing it wrong, or trying and failing, of not being smart enough. And no amount of self talk was able to correct this problem. A med change was."
175884888,Have you been sleeping enough?
175884889,It’s hard and I understand it because you can overthink all this and it’s quite common. We’ve all been there and there’s reasons why the doctors say things. Sz is a serious disorder but untreated sz really isn’t very good and most likely brain damage. Even depressive episodes are probably damaging the brain too. It’s not so much about the diagnosis anyway. It’s about the results of treatment. If the medications are keeping you out of trouble then it’s a good thing. You need them. If you don’t need them or they cause problems you’ll soon find out. Most of us here go through changes in diagnosis. So. No. You shouldn’t but I realize your new to all this. Best advice. Don’t overthink it and just do what you need to do. Concentrate on study or whatever you are doing and try not to obsess about sz or the label. That will look after itself.

I want to go back to school, but the schizophrenia is really messing me up. Perhaps, next year. I keep saying “Next Year” and putting it off. I’m 30 years old and I am trying my best.

175884930,Yes. You were delusional. I’m getting really frustrated with you going round in circles all the time. So I’m going to take a break from reading your posts. You’ve really got to stop this ruminating over everything and you’ve got to stop trying to get us to say you don’t belong on meds. That’s your whole goal on this site. You want us to agree with you and say you were never delusional and you don’t need meds. But you were and you do. You’re trying to manipulate us and it’s frustrating.

175885013,"Valentines Day....It just makes me think too much. Like we have this whole day set aside in the year where we are telling people how much we love them and care about them, but personally it makes me think, am I doing enough on the regular days or the hard days to let people know that I love them and I care about them? So it really starts to weigh on me. I discussed this with a friend on break today and she said that's true, but also she is happy for these days because it makes us question whether we do enough on the regular or hard days. I just think like when I got out of the hospital, that was a really rough time and lots of support then would have been great, and I think of all the people I know right now who are recovering from surgery or about to have surgery and if I am doing enough to show them that I care about them and their families and all that they are going through. Then I start to think I'm not and how I need to change all of that. So yay for Valentines, but wow, there's just so much

I have been living with my parents since being diagnosed sz(not including stays at a group home/mental facility and hospital.) What exactly do you expect to gain by moving out? It’s just more bills, more stress for you and more isolation. You add in your addiction and I would say it sounds like a bad move to me. As you said, one day you will have to when your parents are gone but personally, as a sz, with all the financial hardships that come with it I would put off that day for as long as possible. I guess it would be different if you plan to have a family or something…then you need a degree of independence. .

175885115,"There are ups and down to a college or university. The down is the cost and the gamble of good professors,. In my experience, that's mostly with philosophy--the philosophy professors were awesomely bad a, but only in philosophy! It's 50/50 that you'll get a bad philosophy professor. I had one racist philosophy professor that said one white man was more creative than 10 Asian men. I had another that would childishly call me names like ""meno"". I had another one that tortured his students with Wittgensteining Philosophy in my phl of mind class. The level of stress this man brought to the class because he wanted them all to give up philosophy. It ultimately lead to my sz breakdown because I had him in two classes in a semester, and did a symposium with him. My ancient philosophy professor read a few paragraphs of _NAME_ in an anthology and decided to ""teach"" _NAME_--the first day of class of that he lost the entire class because many of them already read _NAME_ and disagreed with him outloud.. A ki
d in the front row would always take naps because it never got above room temperature in that class. He never showed excitement. I think he didn't like me right away because I politely asked him if he would go over Pythagoras, but instead he didn't want to excite a student, and instead dragged us through every other pre socratic, except Socrates the man, and Pythagoras, All my experiences with math, science, psychology, History, lit, were fantastic though. But with phl,, I don't know, I had a better experience with philosophers in community college rather than the university. I don't know why that is. It was crazy to see my philosophy of science professor openly criticize my philosophy of early modern philosophy just because I asked her what's the distinction between continental and analytical, and then I went to him to ask the same question. Then He criticize my philosophy of mind, and thought he took down _PERSON_ while he was at it in like a 2 minute period. Philosophers at the university basically want yo
u to be a good dog, sit in the chair and not ask questions, and agree with their own philosophy. Then you're a good boy, and if you're a good enough boy by obeying them, then they will write you a letter of recommendation. I wasn't a blank slate coming into the university regarding philosophy, because I read most of the books before hand. For instance, my philosophy of science professor somehow tried to do a _PERSON_ into 1984 while I was under psychosis, thinking everything was hacked, and that people were spying on me and my girlfriend. He said the meaning of 1984 was that you couldn't make love in private. A: that triggered the **** out of me B: he was so far off from the true meaning, which was right there on the first page, that you can't be an individual with individual thoughts. _NAME_ first act was that he started a journal--that was the original sin he committed against his government. Okay, im venting. I'll stop now. If I can vent anywhere, I guess this might be the best place. Sorry guys."

175885140,"Thank you for your response! Your comment reminds me that there are 2 sides to this like right now, my OCD is really bad and I have been diagnosed so I get more easily bothered when other people make light of OCD but when I was in high school I had symptoms of OCD but whenever I looked up stories about OCD they were always about severe OCD and because my OCD wasn't severe at the time I was like ""oh I'm just being stupid thinking that I have OCD, its clearly much worse than what I am dealing with"" but I really do have OCD. I have wondered if I have Borderline Personality Disorder and, kind of like you with OCD, I go back and forth with myself like I feel like I have the symptoms but then I wonder if I'm completely off on what it is actually like to have BPD. Idk if that made sense, but I was just thinking about it because you were saying you wonder if you have OCD and I don't want you to think that if you aren't experiencing severe symptoms that you don't have it. You said that you feel like you m
ainly have the obsessive part but mental compulsions are still compulsions so if you are thinking about something over and over in order to relieve anxiety then it could be OCD. In my experience, OCD can sometimes be a tricky one to treat (I'm sure Bipolar probably is too though) in that none of the ""normal' therapists seem to know how to treat OCD and I have only been successful in my treatment since I started seeing an OCD specialist which I only bring up in case your therapist didn't recognize that you have OCD."

175885152,I would recommend trying D-vitamin as a natural anti-depressant. Works for me. Also consuming some raw cocoa might lift your mood. Talking to people is a good idea. If that’s not a option just going out to a shop and being around other people might help. You don’t really need to buy anything. Just have the social bit as your agenda.

I have 5x 5mg valium to take with zopiclone when I can't sleep and then I should be ok - It will slowly decrease in the blood for 2 weeks until I'm off of the benzos. Then I'll just use 0.5-1.5mg of xanax (10-30mg of valium worth) when I have derealized/depersonalized panic attacks. I'll find something else to relax in the evening like chamomile tea. I can't drink alcohol anymore because I'm intolerant to it now after tripping. I don't think it matters which benzos you take as long as you only take 10mg of valium worth 1-2 times a week. 2mg of klonopin = 40mg of valium 1mg of xanax = 20mg of valium 15mg of valium = 15mg of valium 1mg of ativan = 10mg of valium"

I was the child by the Ex husband she hated so I guess I was a reminder. My Grandmother would always say to my Mom, that’s your daughter, you have to try better etc. She would usually take my side and kinda scold my Mom. When my Grandmother died everyone showed their real feelings and nobody really liked me I guess except my Grandparents. Hurts a lot. I can’t seem to get over it or accept it and move on.

175885187,"Hello everyone, I decided to try to write here as I am so lost and confused the past couple of days. I had a relationship with a person who told me was diagnosed with depression. However, his moods change very quickly - almost every two weeks he is a changed person. He recently told me he might be bipolar II but is not yet diagnosed. Some days ago he broke off the relationship (over phone..) and told me we want different things in life, which is true, but we have also talked so many times how we can at least try as we feel so good together. When he broke off the other day he mentioned he might be manic but he is not sure. He is on antidepressants for some months now. I am super confused and don't know what to do. I will try to see him in some 10 days time and talk with him. I don't know whether he really feels that way or it's his mood acting up. Thank you in advance for any kind of help.

I’ve experienced things beyond comprehension, the kinds of things that change you forever that you’re never the same after you deal with it. We all have here. It just comes with the territory unfortunately."

175885233,Yeah. I have good insight so if I was delusional I would tell you about it. My main delusions are delusions of reference which tend to occur when I’m really depressed. But when it happens I’m well aware that it is a delusion due to years of sz (former diagnosis).

175885253,Isn’t it a bummer to get paranoia while on meds. I get so frustrated with it. It only happens every so often but when it does I’m just reminded of how fragile I am
175885254,"Oh yeah, I saw that movie, that was good, but totally not doable in the real. Nobody cares that much. People are too lazy fundamentally to pull off something of that magnitude. But I’ve had the thought before."
175885255,"Well, if reassurance was all I needed, thank you."
175885256,Yes I agree that it is possible. Unfortunately I have a very high stress and attention requiring job. It’s hard to listen to patients when I’m hearing jumbled voices coming from behind me.
175885257,All I know is that I’ve had serious bouts with depression. The voices didn’t change no matter which way it went.

The meds help even me out and slow the impact of delusions to a manageable degree, but I still have lots of work to do to feel better. It’s hard work."

Not to say that we don’t need approval from some people, because it still matters to a point."

Spinal cord injury is caused by the injury of the spinal cord, but HSP is caused by neurodegeneration of the nerves. And yes, I suffer from a huge amount of pain. I was on very high doses of opioids. And my doctor later switched my pain med to gabapentin, and now to ibuprofin. But despite that I still get a lot of pain. I have several friends with CP, SCI, MD- all of us suffer from really high pain levels with varying degrees of degeneration and weakness. We’re just trying to manage the condition(s) we have with the best of our abilities. Do you use a wheelchair? I’m using crutches full time but walking gets tiring. But I don’t want to give up yet because I want to walk as long as I can.

175885383,"^ you must be an artist I was being avoidant and accidentally missed my phone appointment with my therapist. I didn't realize it at first because we've been doing Fridays and it was a different day this week (normally I cancel appointments as opposed to being completely irresponsible). I listened to the voicemail today and she sounded kind of disappointed in me or resigned. I don't know if she can tell I'm going to disappear off the map for a while from her or if she was frustrated that I missed the appointment. A few years ago, she tried to do a type of attachment repair where she offered me comfort in a situation. She said people can have the desire to lash out and (only half) jokingly thanked me for not taking a swing at her. I did kind of feel like I was on fire though. She then told me that I would have the urge to get angry with her and dislike her and find a reason to stop seeing her. I thought she was wrong, but in the appointment after that, I literally got angry, disliked her and stopped 
going to her for almost 2 years. I swore I'd never go back, but when $#%^ hit the fan about a year ago, I requested she reopen my file because I believed her to be trustworthy and competent, so it actually kind of worked or started to work. The delay with the phone is because I've been experiencing depression (I'm assuming another reason why I'm avoiding people in real life) < I didn't know I was experiencing this until my shrink evaluated me recently and he noticed a huge increase in this area (oddly enough given I don't feel particularly unhappy most the time) We were talking about meds and he wanted to augment my antidepressant with a neuroleptic after I declined a different option. I specifically chose this doctor because he wasn't going to do that. He acknowledges that he doesn't think I have any psychosis, yet wants to give me neuroleptics (though I'm concerned that if I don't start sleeping properly I might start seeing things). This is one of the most enraging things I can think of. They don't realize 
the side effects and harm they cause To note: I acknowledge other people find them much more helpful than problematic and I don't recommend anyone going off their meds We eventually agreed upon something else after I dug my heals in. Returning from that tangent, I wonder if she thinks I'm doing it again. I wonder if she sees the same pattern with attachment with me and if we've gotten a closer rapport or something. Personally, I have always found it a good thing to withdraw at times because I tend to be better at finding my own solutions and needs and then returning to her for help in meeting those goals. ^ Not only that, but I'm still applying and trying to get a handle on the things (it's slow going) she taught me, so it's not like I dropped everything. I feel kind of bad, but I think it's better than me getting angry and ruining my rapport with her and making myself look bad in the ""system."" When I move back to my ""happy place"" city, they'll be used to more serious issues than mine and stop treating me 
like an incompetent retard. On a positive note, for my final practicum assignment, they're decreasing my grad requirements for this piece because they know I excelled in all the subject matter and already have a fair amount of experience in the field. Because of this, they said they have no concerns in tailoring the final requirements to my current issues. That's a relief for me. I say this here because it's on my mind which makes it relevant to the thread (even if it's not necessarily relevant to the subforum topics)."

I've been miserable like ... wtf it's actually ****ing BS. Every time I go down on the dose again I turn into a puddle for a week and a half. And you have to understand I'm not normally an emotional person at all, it's out of character for me entirely. I was only on this stuff for so long because of catatonia related crap, thankfully my anxiety levels are not terribly high ...

174325804,"I just read this about Rexulti on Wikipedia, I think at lower doses Rexulti acts like Risperdal and doesn’t improve negative symptoms as much as Abilify: “Brexpiprazole has more blocking and less stimulating activity at the dopamine receptors than its predecessor, aripiprazole, which may decrease its risk for agitation and restlessness. Specifically, where aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity or agonist effect at the D2 receptor of 60%+, brexpiprazole has an intrinsic activity at the same receptor of about 45%. For aripiprazole, this means more dopamine receptor activation at lower doses, with blockade being reached at higher doses, whereas brexpiprazole is the opposite.” en.wikipedia.org Brexpiprazole Brexpiprazole, sold under the brand name Rexulti, is an atypical antipsychotic.

175885453,LS! I am taking Risperidone (Risperdal) for the last seven years. However (I am almost 62) I have sometimes a racing heart. Today my heart was examined for the third time. For the second time a cardiologist told me that Risperdal damages the heart and I should consult my psychiatrist for a change in medication. Personally I like Risperdal: I can live really disciplined health conscious for years in a row with it.

I have degenerative disc disease so you can imagine how I felt after that long wait. I am taking everyone's advice and remaining as calm as possible. I am taking my meds trying my best to get past all this. I also have cancer and am supposed to start treatment in the next month. It has taken forever to get a treatment plan and now this virus is making a mess of it. I honestly don't want to start my treatment till all this is behind me. As we all know the medical community is asking everyone to stay inside and not go out. Businesses are closed and I know they are hurting. We must flatten the curve so as not to overrun our hospitals and medical staffs. Now it seems our president is thinking of opening everythin

All over the world countries are telling us not to do what they did but to slow down the spread of this virus. No amount of money is worth dying for.

174325822,"I have been diagnosed with Schizophrenia and this was my delusion. I woke up with a hard pound in my chest around the end of December in 2014. First thing I saw was this reaper looking figure above me with a scythe in his hands, a reaper I guess. I wove my hands around to see if it was real, at that time it did not feel real. After a few months I started seeing things that looked and was told to me by these voices was ghosts and spirits. I didn’t freak out or anything only got curious as to how this was possible. These voices started messing with me and telling me where everyone I knew around me was and was going to show up at the house and so they did. I was amazed and just grew more curious as to what was going on. After some time of talking to these voices I realized something they kinda told me that yelling into the ground or some crazy outburst kinda thing would do something. I was like “so I was like seein stuff and some things was crazy correct and others a bit out there.” I got freake
d out thinking something was out to get me killed since the voices did say I was doomed. Wow ok so I am doomed and people want to fight or kill me. Man I got all kinds of paranoid. As long as the voices got me to believe something they seemed satisfied “like ok so your aliens then or no your god or no what are you where are you why are you doing this to me” so real how could someone or some being in space send me telepathic voices from so far away what can do this. I just didn’t know what to believe anymore. Cutting the story short I was put in a hospital for the mentally ill and ended up talking to other people about what happened to them and how they came to be there but only some because most people stuck to themselves or just wanted to fight everyone because of severe anger problems but hey later those people changed after taking meds. I learned that a lot of things happened to other people like they happened to me I just do not know how extreme it was for them versus how extreme it was for me but I 
got insight meds and well its when I got out to mhmr that I really got to talk to nice people to help me out. All in all those voices are nothing but liars and tricksters and only seem to want you doomed or something to that effect. I went through two years of fighting with these voices and my whole story is long and I do have memory issues because of the constant talking in my head and I was feeling, smelling things and being put in pain from these ghost and spirits poking my insides I could see them doing it and it hurt all the time I could do nothing but curl up in a ball and rock back and forth. I lost so much sleep it really sucked to go through this. I am on decent meds now I am doing great I can handle playing some games on the computers I built and watching some shows but sometime they do come back and make me feel something or say something just to remind me they are still there and waiting for me to let my guard down. I would like to say for all of us that suffer with this to not give up and keep pu
tting one foot in front of the other we can not control these things and we are not dangerous people to be around we are just not understood by most people."

174325823,"I think I’m resolving a lot of hatred of myself. Thank you guys. So I’ve been thinking a lot about what will happen in the future. I may not stay in Canada, but what’s so wrong with that? I mean sure, I will never be able to talk or advocate for others on the grounds of mental illness. I will die without my brother knowing about my schizophrenia. I’m not really afraid of death. I’ve been scared of it after I received the diagnosis of a degenerative disease, and the scare of cardiomyopathy. 50% those who have dilated cardiomyopathy die. I’m totally okay with that now. Only the Heavens know if that’ll ever going to happen, but I’m not afraid of it. Since time is the only thing I’m fighting, I’m thinking of writing my brother series of letters- given that he will have the chance to read it after I die. I’m worried about my brother getting angry at my parents due to the sentiment they had on my mental health and how they decided to hide my illness because they were ashamed, but I 
feel like he has the right to know- only after my death. Or, I may end up in Canada if the officer deems me not applicable for excessive demand. Since I have not been hospitalized for 3+ years and remains mostly symptom free (except for CPTSD), it could happen. I don’t know. We’ll see what they decide. If they decide I’m excessively demanding, okay I’ll go back my country and start my life there. No problem. But I let go of most things now. I’m not afraid of most things that’s firing at me. Not even the fear of death can stop me from going forward."

I knew something was wrong in me, I thought about mental illness but refused the idea. At 18y.o. I researched my symptoms and found sz, I refused the idea of having sz as it was a horrible illness, it meant that I am crazy/demented and violent. But now sz explains everything, my violence, paranoia, delusions, grandiosity, negative and cognitive symptoms etc Meds made negative and cognitive symptoms worse than without meds but got rid of the worse, positive symptoms and violence/irritability."

We talked about how foods aren't all good or all bad (like black and white thinking where you say something such as salad is good and pizza is bad, which is a cognitive distortion). We went into a few other cognitive distortions and also discussed intuitive eating. Some of the rules of the group are not to talk about BMI, not to talk about specific weight numbers, dieting, anything like that that can be triggering. I'm looking forward to going again next week"

174325826,"Before I go to sleep I will make a note to DT about anhedonia and schizophrenia/schizoaffective.. Note 1.3.2; When you have a delusion, you believe 100% that something is true. Example; People can believe that someone close to them died which triggers a strong mental reaction like a drug. Imagine.. Tying someone up and killing their whole family in front of him/her. But what if that was his/her hallucination? I believe anhedonia in schizophrenia is the brains protective strategy to stop people from feeling too much fake emotions from fake/non real delusions. But that doesn't explain schizoaffective. Although you can still have emotions with schizophrenia.. it's just lack of pleasure.. so negative symptoms.. It's like schizoaffective is the true schizophrenia because delusions always must trigger some type of emotional reaction.. mood wise.. Idk what I'm talking about but you can see the idea... And no psychiatrists have come up with this idea of explanation... only Tweaky.."

Conversely though, I get very upset if I don't feel well / if I'm in a bad situation and I feel that I'm responsible for it. I spend a considerable amount of energy convincing myself that certain mistakes can't be avoided, but making sure that I've learned what I could learn from it so I can prevent future mistakes that can be avoided.

Might as well stay up and reset my sleeping schedule. My delivery was attempted at 7:05pm tonight but they couldn't get in the building.

I am hoping the doctor will give us some good directions on how to treat her diabetes and what to do for her. We dropped off her overnight bag which included insulin, an ice pack for the insulin, syringes, and food and so I got to see the vet hospital. It looked clean and the office staff seemed friendly.

175885622,There’s a big difference between a scientific theory and just your average theory. For science you need some rigorous testing and repeatable results. We know the Sun is a star and we have figured out that planets are there. Space is real. It’s like gravity. That is a scientific theory. You don’t fly off the planet even though it’s travelling through space because of gravity. You know it exists because it’s simple repeatable testing that will teach you what goes up must come down.

174325851,"Ignoring my voices and refusing to interact with them didn’t make them go away. It just changed how I reacted to them and eventually helped me stop reacting to them. This reduced the severity of my delusions, really strengthened my insight, lowered my stress level, and helped lower the amount of medication I needed to manage the voices since I was no longer at risk of acting on the commands they had been giving me. They went from being a threat to me to background noise I could ignore. After that I found better meds and supplements that have mostly gotten rid of them. I now go for extended periods without positive symptoms, they only come back when I’m under a lot of stress, but they are still just noise I can ignore."

But he will do things like offer to get me fast food in the morning when I wake up or any time I have a craving he goes and gets me something. It is really making it challenging to make changes and I expressed this to him. I don’t think he took it seriously though because now he just does the exact same thing but says “I don’t mean to be an enabler but do you want x junk food”. The other day he got me a pint of ice cream when I was sad and ordered pizza and yesterday I was happy about getting a new job and he suggested we get mikes hard lemonade and he kept offering to get me another drink and I ended up going over my calorie count AGAIN.

This getting under the skin of people might have been too much for me, or maybe it was they way I interpited it. I didn’t have my first psychosis before a few years later, but I think studying psychology might have been the trigger.

So I can conclude there is something that causes unbelievable things to happen in your reality, because the reality gets created by the brain. We never see the true reality.

The world has a lot of different people. Not everyone has a lot of compassion or are very warm, but then again it takes all kinds to make the world go around. For example a surgeon may need to have nerves of steel. Someone who works at the morgue as a phatologist may need to have a cold disposition to stomach their job. During world war 2 people who were reffered to as psychopats were favored as airplane pilots because they weren’t afraid to die and had a cold disposition with nerves of steel, but they actually contributed positivly trying to win the war.

Over a period of many, many years, I slowly developed a code. I know it so well now that I don't have to refer to a cheat sheet or anything, as it is all in my head. It does take me longer to read over what I have written, but I find that's a cool way of doing stream of consciousness-type writing, because it's not as easy to go back and immediately see the preceding lines. Sometimes people look over my shoulder in public when I am writing, and they ask me what all the strange symbols are. I always reply, ""It's code so people don't see what I'm writing when they look over my shoulder."" They almost always get defensive and explain that they weren't looking, even though they obviously just were. Anyway, sorry for rambling, but I've found this has helped me to express myself in an honest way. One of my greatest fear

175885810,"# Mitochondrial function influences schizophrenia status in patients with genetic disorder A multidisciplinary team of researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) showed how the “batteries” of cells are highly implicated in whether patients with the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome develop schizophrenia. The results of the study may eventually lead to targeted prevention and treatment strategies for patients with the condition. The findings were published today in JAMA Psychiatry . 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q) is a chromosomal difference that occurs in approximately one out of every 2,000 births and is associated with varying degrees of medical issues affecting every system in the body, including the developing heart, immune system, palate, and brain. 22q is also associated with behavioral health challenges such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and anxiety. Th
ese symptoms can be observed during childhood and can present as psychiatric illness in older adolescents and adults. In fact, this group is roughly 25 times more likely to develop schizophrenia than those in the general population, providing an opportunity to understand the genetic cause of the condition and develop novel therapeutics to treat it. In a prior study, CHOP researchers studied stem cell-derived neurons and demonstrated that, compared with healthy controls, patients with 22q and schizophrenia had mitochondrial dysfunction. However, that study did not account for 22q patients who had not developed schizophrenia. “Schizophrenia is a very complex mental health disorder, and it can be particularly debilitating for patients with 22q when coupled with a myriad of other health challenges,” said senior study author _NAME_ A_NAME_, MD, Director of Research in the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Services and associate director of the Lifespan Brain Institute at CHOP and Pen
n. “In this most recent study, it was important to define the role mitochondria play in determining which patients with 22q—particularly teenagers—are likely to develop schizophrenia.” Using different lines of stem cells than were used for the prior study, the researchers compared mitochondrial function and the expression of related genes from adults with 22q and a control group, with the 22q group including neurons from individuals with and without a schizophrenia diagnosis. The researchers showed again that mitochondrial function was impacted in patients with 22q and a schizophrenia diagnosis, with reduced levels of ATP, a major energy source for cells produced largely by mitochondria. However, ATP levels were not reduced in patients with 22q who were not diagnosed with schizophrenia. In fact, the expression of multiple genes encoding for oxidative phosphorylation, a process that helps produce ATP, was upregulated compared with both the 22q and schizophrenia group and the control group. These findin
gs suggest that increased mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with the absence of schizophrenia in 22q. “Bioenergetics and mitochondria have historically not been thought to play a significant role in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, but our findings from this study coupled with previous findings show that mitochondrial dysfunction may play an important role in these neuropsychiatric disorders,” said co-author _NAME_, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at CHOP. “Recognizing the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders may lead to the development of better diagnostic tools as well as targeted treatments for patients with 22q-associated schizophrenia.” “Patients with 22q present with a wide variety of symptoms, and while our team helps families navigate these challenges across many different medical specialties, the sheer number of associated features can significantly impact both the patients and their families’ lives—with 
behavioral health being the most complex and difficult to manage,” said co-author _NAME_, MS, CGC, Director of the 22q and You Center and Associate Director of Clinical Genetics Center at CHOP. “The more we know about how each individual is affected at a deeper genomic level, the more resources we can provide to families, while pivoting future research efforts towards finding new ways to help our patients, as well as those in the general population with schizophrenia but without 22q.”"

174325878,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:_PHONE_NO_ EndHTML:_PHONE_NO_ StartFragment:_PHONE_NO_ EndFragment:_PHONE_NO_ I have been a psychiatric inpatient 3 times now. I have been “properly diagnosed” as “Bipolar/Schizophrenic”, and unfortunately by one of the leading experts in the field, in my country. My question is about my diagnosis. Does the above description fit with what “fellow sufferers”, experience as “psychotic breaks”? If I examine the symptoms/signs of bipolarism, I can definitively state that I do not have this disorder. However; I do have some similarity of symptoms when it comes to schizophrenia: Schizophrenia Symptoms Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behaviour or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include: Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you’re being harm
ed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. - No Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don’t exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. - Yes (I sometimes believe that there is a possibility, that something external to myself, may be interacting with me) Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can’t be understood, sometimes known as word salad. - No Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behaviour. This may s
how in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behaviour isn’t focused on a goal, so it’s hard to do tasks. Behaviour can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.- No Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn’t make eye contact, doesn’t change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may have lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure. - No Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. - Yes (I’m stuck with constant happiness and “episodes” occur randomly but are always about the same duration and strength) In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In 
women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It’s uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45. - No (I initiated this whole thing at the age of 46 – my age isn’t impossible though, just rare) So as you can see, my main problem at the moment, is: Do I have schizophrenia? Or am I simply doing this to “myself”? I’m not suffering: I have a stable life. I live in a constant state of true happiness. On the surface, to the “outside world”, I have changed very little. I can control my emotions. I can contain my “non-episodic” comments/”helpful advice”. My mind is manic during an episode, but my thoughts are still clear and logical (even upon reflection during non-episodic periods). I could go on, but frankly, who’d read it? It’s already really long. Anyway…"

175885815,one time I carried an opened pocket knife in my hand as I walked to my car at night thinking someone was going to rape me…that’s the only time I was ever armed…I was delusional but I never hurt anyone. I was a danger to myself all the time when I was ill.
175885816,I get like that too. I have to go to the store so I do my best to keep my thoughts and anxiety in one place and just do it. and know I’m gonna be bombarded with my symptoms. I go straight there and back. Just doing that every so often kinda desensitize you and you get use to going out. I find it’s very important for me to leave the house at least once a day even just to walk a block. I see nothing serious is happening outside. And if I stay in too long or dont talk to the people I talk to for a while I get stuck thinking crazy paranoid thoughts about what’s happening out there.

So if anybody comes I get anxious too. But it always works out. People understand she is still a pup (1 year). And lately she calms down a little after a little time, so it is getting better. Practice your skills. Deep breathing exercises. Everything is going to be okay and hopefully they will locate the problem quickly. I am glad you aren't as anxious as you have been before, that is a big step. Best wishes... _PERSON_, _NAME_..."

Then I ordered a loveseat that would be here faster but they backordered it without telling me. So I finally noticed and cancelled that and ordered another loveseat that turned out too small that I now have to ship back. I finally said forget shopping online and went to the furniture store and bought a sofa. It’s not exactly what I dreamed of but it’s comfortable and well built. And at least it’s big enough. They are going to deliver it tomorrow. Hopefully they can get it through the door. I measured, it should fit, but you never know, fingers crossed."

174325887,There seems to be lots of new names and several posts I’ve read recently are clearly not by people living with schizophrenia. I think this site is probably getting over run by trolls and jerks looking to use us as their entertainment. It’s getting creepy.

175885858,My psychosis is coming back! I’ve been having breakthrough psychotic symptoms for a while now and today I drank both half an energy drink and a large bubble tea and it got worse!

175885859,"I can exercise, but within limits. No running, some walking, being careful with weights or calisthenics. I can’t exercise in the manner I’d like to because of cardiac issues. Pushing past the negatives and pain from past injuries to keep moving is also daunting."
175885860,"Mine talk to me as if i was a child. “bless your heart”, “aint you sweet” etc etc. I named her vicky, after my old probation officer. Yes it sounds nice - to have a re-assuring voice like that, but it makes me uneasy, cos im fully aware its in my head now - and im sorta scared to be called a narcissist. Maybe i crave a mother figure - i dunno. The delusional part of me, thought for a long time it was an angel looking out for me - but that just sends me down the rabbit hole. It was quite a shock, and dissappointment - when the insight kicked in - that i wasnt special, and it was in my head. Took me a few months to get over it."
175885861,"Im taking 20 mg olanzapine and 500 depakote. I’m still dealing with people talking about me and I now question my whole daily experience.

175885862,Towards the end of my work career they were mental health days. We’d get our 8 a year without certificates and I’d use all of them every year. I really maxed out my mental health days but I needed that in hindsight. Hope your feeling better tomorrow. Hang in there.

175885865,Thanks I always worry about what I say because I feel like I’m calling too much attention to myself but my psych says that I have to get used to being uncomfortable and then I won’t be uncomfortable anymore so I’m finally getting used to sharing more I guess...

175885885,"Hi all, and _PERSON_, I totally understand how you feel, I am also quite anxious about the virus even thought I am 44 and don't have any other health problems (as far as I know, lol). The thing is one of my colleagues got sore throat last week Tuesday, he did a couple things on my computer and fixes a couple things 20 cm far away from my face. Then called sick the next day with flu symptoms. I contacted him to ask how he was doing yesterday (after 9th day of his sickness) and he said he is feeling better but not coming to work because he is still showing slight symptoms (as a rule everyone should follow). I have been feeling extremely tired with pain in my arms and legs (though I recently moved and I remember straining my arm muscles a few times 2 weeks ago) and slight chest burning/pressure since last week thursday - friday. I really want to believe that my symptoms are because of anxiety. I am sorta counting days and so obsessed that this will worsen and I will start having fever and lung distres
s after 7th-8th days, which is today. These times are so tough for everyone, but I think we should try to stay away from news on internet as much as we can, as we have anxiety and this alone is a good reason to weaken out immune systems."

175885895,I’m just 50 and no intention of going back to work. I get stressed. I get stressed I get paranoid and it all spirals down from there. I too am on disability pension since about 2004 besides a short term in the book trade. I actually had a really good advocate at this disability employment agency but they lost funding and it went shite after that pretty quickly…A good reason to stay on the pension and volunteer. Your right _AT_MENTION_ . We do need special help and that isn’t really there with all this rubbish they put people through these days. I worry about the kids coming through with sz. I would hope they have the opportunity to get on the dsp rather than unemployment which is so much more below the poverty line. As to those you work with…that really can make a difference to your work experience. It’s not easy with difficult people and can relate to your frustrations. People can be such dicks.

Like, I have topics to write about but I just can’t think of what to say. Like, idk what’s wrong with me. I feel like the VRAYLAR is affecting me a bit. Like my ability to write and stuff. Idk. It could be my mental state tho cuz I’ve been in an episode. Idk I just feel different With the VRAYLAR. Mostly good. But there’s a couple of things I’m worried about, like my speech and thought process/ability to think. But also, I just realized I ran out of fish oil and all my other vitamins the day or day after I started my new VRAYLAR dose. I feel like it may be my mental state from the previous week and lack of fish oil. Because the first day and second day I was on this new VRAYLAR dose, I had been writing just fine still. Then I ran out of fish oil that second day."
175885901,Going through anxiety attack I think. I want to go to the hospital. I feel watched. Don’t want people to read my thoughts. I am the saddest person I feel. I have it difficult sometimes waking up in the morning not wanting to and this is the third day in the week for possible panic/anxiey attack. They make me sound so bad. I am afraid of people hearing me. I know someone is doing this to me. Making me sound like a sick person. I don’t want these people to talk to me. My thoughts become worse when I have these anxiety/panic attacks. I am scared when I hear people talk to me. What if I say the wrong thing? I think people make me saying the wring thing. I recall things that happened in my thoughts and it makes me anxious I just need to be left alone. Please God I pray to live a normal life. I hate intrusive thoughts even though they are not my own.

175885907,I think that bad feeling tbh is part of the anxiety and restlessness this med has been causing me. Who knows really. I’m hoping I can eventually go on injection so I can try to get on a more normal sleep schedule
175885908,Ha! I dig it! 15
175885909,Just like any treatment talking therapies aren’t for everyone. In fact they made me a lot worse. Had 4 courses including OT and cbt for psychosis. In each case the psychotherapist cut short the courses because it was obvious they were causing harm I don’t think anyone should be shamed for not wanting any given treatment

Other minor things get put off, like filling out my grocery list, putting the tarp on the car, getting my income tax done, shaving. All smaller projects, but they get pushed aside for they don't have to be done soon. So I just go to my major project until something more important comes along. You say, the deadline things from your job get done, ""its the list of other stuff that gets me overwhelmed and I think to much about it vs ""getting it done"". This builds anxiety just thinking about it and that anxiety make me tired....then I take naps LOL!!."" And you got a larger project done, ""but didnt get the list of little things done earlier in the day (which are not enjoyable) but should have been done."" And ""Thi
s is more like my brain just sputtering in response to wondering were to start. As a ""do-it-your-selfer"" my list never ends, and it somewhat burns me out. I could throw darts at it, but there's got to be a better way....."" Maybe it's the already existing anxiety that 's the problem. It sounds like your brain is speeded up, and if it sees 10 tasks, it has to do 10 tasks, and it has to do them today. I have bipolar, and without medicine, an anti-depressant and a stabilizer (Lithium for me), my mind goes 100 miles per hour and life is going at about 50 miles an hour. With life going at about 50 miles per hour, I can get about 4 or 5 smaller tasks done a day. I can't get 10. There is a saying in bipolar, ""My mind makes contracts which my body can't keep."" The mind is going faster than the body can actually fulfill the duties. This causes frustration, and so you just lay down and take a nap. Have you ever taken any medicine for anxiety or bipolar?"

174325904,Need to create strict rules like shower everyday before sleep at night and then follow it as if no choice to skip it. Overtime it becomes a habit and easy to follow. This is how we can beat the negative symptoms so easily.

175885951,"I think people are happier with kids if they WANT kids and feel capable of raising them. Otherwise, people are probably happier without them. Wanted kids are much happier than kids who feel like a burden, and tend to be more successful as adults. Kids who don’t have at least one safe, secure attachment have more trouble mentally and emotionally, and wind up with higher rates of addiction, risky behavior, trouble with law enforcement, enter into abusive relationships, have explosive outbursts, etc. But that is all just the symptoms we see, because they affect us. Internally, they are more likely to feel useless, worthless, suicidal, and like they don’t deserve love from anyone. Those are the symptoms that need to be treated, and it is tricky because there is no diagnosis for “Did not feel loved as a child” so doctors are just left calling it BPD or PTSD and those don’t really inform anyone how to proceed."

175885989,"It is not the end of the phenomenon of coincidences which happened in my life. I noticed some coincidences associated with numbers 12 and 4 last time. Large ones are associated with sums of first, second and third digits in two very coincident triplets: 7, 29, 139 and 5, 23, 421 . Sum of digits in first numbers: 7+5 = 12 . Sum of digits in second numbers: 2+9+2+3 = 16 . Sum of digits in third numbers: 1+3+9+4+2+1 = 20 . We have received arithmetic sequence: 12, 16, 20 . Sums of digits in these two numbers are additive primes and two triplets (7, 29, 139; 5, 23, 421) which “gave” numbers 12, 16, 20 are built of additive primes: 1+2 = 3, 1+6 = 7, 2+0 = 2. Why 12, 16, 20 is coincident with 12 4 ? The smallest member of that sequence is 12 . Sum of numbers in that sequence is 48 and 48 is 12x4 . Difference between the largest and the smallest term of that sequence is 8 , 8 is 12-4 (difference of 12 and 4), (12+4) : 2 (arithmetic mean of 12 and 4) and 1x2x4 (product of digits forming phrase 12 4). C
ommon difference of 12, 16, 20 is 4 . Arithmetic mean of 12, 16, 20 is 16 , 16 is 12+4 . Middle term of that sequence is 16 , 16 is 12+4 . Sum of digits in that sequence is 12 (1+2+1+6+2+0). Arithmetic mean of sum of digits in numbers forming sequence above is 4 (((1+2)+(1+6)+(2+0)):3 = (3+7+2):3 = 12:3 = 4). Number of terms of 12, 16, 20 is 3 , 3 is 12:4 ."

Another 50£ was just deducted for a hotel I never agreed to, but I probably can stay there. That seems about it, but there is still 50£ in another theft. 50£ will be refunded.

Another reason why I like headphones is because now I can play at like 3am if I wanted to and not disturb anybody."

I am just going to stuff it down and act like everything is fine. Even though I want to SH so badly. Wish I could dissociate right now and not have to feel anything or think anything. Just be gone.

175886052,Welcome to the forum!!!
175886053,"I was already asocial long before I learned to dread things in advance, though. I wonder if there's a bit of OCD in doing that. I've been like this for so long, why change now? I'm scared of feelings. I remember when I was a teenager and all of the drama that went with it. Having a crisis just because of some tangled social faux pas or something. Seemed to be a waste of psychic energy. I'm betting a lot of people would mute their emotional responses if they had the opportunity. So perhaps the way to tackle flat affect would be to deal with it as a fear."
175886054,Why was 6 afraid of 7?
175886055,"_AT_MENTION_, Those what? Who?"
175886056,How many meds are you on
175886057,You gonna start feeling better in no time.
175886058,"I watch Fox News only. I’m a conservative. I like _PERSON_ because she’s hot. Most of them are. I think Fox News is biased, but it also doesn’t trigger me like CNN does. If I watch CNN, it’s to see what fake news is like and to get my triggered. It’s like on half of my brain likes CNN and the other likes Fox News. Fox News supports _PERSON_ more. Like _PERSON_ said, I’m not sure how CNN is even around still. It’s a joke. I don’t watch the other liberal news outlets at all. Sometimes, I find a hidden gem or something, but it’s rare."
175886059,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo
u’re just daydreaming to observers."
175886060,"Sorry, _NAME_. I meant to put that in. My pdoc says it’s worth the risk, for now. I actually was started on a different med, yesterday, and it knocked my butt out! So, maybe it won’t be an issue, after all. I want to say thanks, _NAME_, for giving me a heads up. I appreciate you! Take care."
175886061,"For the dystonia I would see a naturopath and have a heavy metals panel done. If something is found he/she will put you on a chelation regimen, and that could possibly clear it up. I’ve heard of that happening a few times."

175886068,You live and learn… I mean they told me it was ok to come off the antipsychotic I didn’t even do it without their consent… But it ended badly…

175886071,It could be yes. But your body may adapt to the medication over time.
175886072,"My sister is coming for a visit this weekend. I'm kind of nervous that she is going to tell us bad news. Last time she came (spring break) she told us her and her husband had separated. (Not that that is entirely bad news, I think her husband is a loser and have ever since I met the guy 20 something years ago when I was a kid.) I just worry about how she is going to be able to support herself and her five children. Also she works for a religious school. I'm concerned that she might lose her job if she gets divorced. I know that is silly. But they have some really stupid rules. For a while they weren't able to go to the movies but you could watch the movie at home when it came out on DVD or streaming. (Um....hello. What is the difference?) So I am worried for her job too. Not that I think she should have to stay in an unhappy marriage. I'm just WORRIED. I don't know how to best support her. I offered to _PERSON_ her some money so she would have some gas money to come down here but she said she is ok
ay."
175886073,"I am really glad you're doing better. I read your posts and I was worried. I really hope you start feeling better. Everyone else who is struggling, too. Hugs to everyone (of the safe variety). Job, I have been having a lot of kava lately. I still feel addicted to caffeine, sadly, though. And alcohol, too, at least a little bit. I don't know if it's a psychosis thing that I'm so attracted to drugs? Oh well."

175886087,"It seems like you have a lot of contradicting theories though. Like no offense but some of the things you say, albeit possible. One of your theories might contradict another. I’ve had it too. That’s how I know I’ve had delusions. I thought of two things that I was near certain were true but they were literally impossible to both be true. You know what I’m saying??? Do you accept you have delusions?? Sometimes I increase in intensity of believing it and I believe it on different levels too but I think I’m ok that I’m delusional and I know I am. I think it’s kinda cool. “He’s the guy who thinks he’s jesus”. Hey there could be worse things right. I just live with it now I’m saying u know. What do you think."

174325936,"I wish I could afford WW, too! I gained 30lbs in 2 months on zyprexa and refused to take it anymore after I had to buy new jeans that fit. It was like I’d eat, then 10 minutes later I’d eat again, then in another 10 minutes. It was an insatiable hunger that always had me thinking about what I’d eat next! I’m on abilify now and don’t have that issue but I still have the 30lbs I gained."
174325934,"_NAME_. I found abilify to be extremely activating, I had to take it in the mornings. I was only sleeping 4 hours at a time. Ended with me stressed, sleep deprived, strung out, and hallucinating men sliting my eye lids open, saying they’ll make me see. Wasn’t a good time."
174325929,Looks good!
175886090,I was always super ambitious when I was younger and I always reached my goals. But reaching my goals never led to success. Somehow I always failed.
175886091,"No way. Even once my own therapy is over, it is just not for me"
175886092,"i shouldn’t talk bad about my dad, as he does a lot for me, and we spend a lot of time together. and usually we get along. but one thing about him is he thinks he is right about everything. me and mom just ignore it. just last week he was starting to catch on to himself, as he said “it’s funny we can have opinions about things without knowing what were talking about” of course that more applies to him but he said “we”. he’s never been a serious academic reading lots of books and challenging his views. once he forms an opinion on a topic, it’s ingrained for life it seems."
175886093,"Other mentally-ill people tell me that I’m not my illness. But the truth is, I can’t help but see myself as my illness. I am what the society tells me that I am. Nothing else matters. No matter what I tell myself, “I’m worthy,” or “I’m good”, that doesn’t change in other people’s eyes because people broadcast on TV and on the Internet saying that schizophrenics are dangerous. No matter how much I shout “schizophrenics are not dangerous!” people do not change. No matter what I tell myself, the society doesn’t change. That’s NOT how others see me. There’s no use of being nice to myself. I deserve to be tortured with _USER_ID_. I’m not worth it."
175886094,"I go through that… I doubt your that bad. I mean I hear other people going on about themselves all the time. It does annoy people but none of them seem to have especial difficulties in finding friends. I try keep any and all of that comparative crap to myself. I do though wind up in a state of feeling superior… which is an awkward place to dwell. Outside of that I feel incredibly isolated at times… The double-edged sword of being one of a kind. I’m special and unique, but because of that no one understands me. From the outside I’m sure I’m normal. Perhaps even intimidating… more so than I would ever give myself credit for… then when realizing that I just get the strange sense of how weird humanity is in general. On a simpler level though… you might just be more self-aware… and you can sense your own heightened sense of connection to things from that. It happens to me… I look at and can feel what everyone else is doing at times… and it really feels like their values must just 
be ??????? or their brains are just far too easily preoccupied."
175886095,Right ? That looks straight out of a comic book.
175886096,My therapist is my least favorite friend We haven’t been get along well lately But she has no bias on my delusions. She’s Jewish so unlike my last therapist she doesn’t try to convince me either way on my catholic delusions. And then the one after that was just out to rob me Hard to find an honest therapist out there Nah it’s not sad get all the support u can get. Therapists are a great resource when u find the right one I see mine again in 34 mins.

175886103,I’m looking for more opinions of users on this forum. Can u still take meds if u stepped on them ?
175886104,"Thanks _NAME_. Your experience and insights are very valuable. I did mention the possibility of splitting the dose. My doctor suggested that I alter the time of the dose first, and try that for some days, to see if it helps with the sleep and the morning agitation. If not then I would try the split dose. Of course, a separate issue is whether this medication is working for me at all. That is hard for me to tell because I do not know what I would be like without it. I am still quite anxious, much of the time, but maybe slightly that a month ago. It is hard for me to tell whether that is because of the passage of time, therapy or medication or all of the above. The doctor thinks there is a likelihood that I will need to increase my dose to at least 75 mg. But I do not think I want to do that — and especially I do not want to do it until the current side effects including the interference with my sleep resolves. I have tried meditation and it is helpful. I do on unguided meditations during the day A
nd I often do a guided meditation to help me fall asleep."

174325935,"I haven’t experienced that problem. I gained 50 pounds when I was on Zyprexa in 1996-97, so this time I decided I was going to restrict to 1200-1400 calories from the start. I am losing slower - one pound a week instead of two - but it’s coming off and I am not gaining. Before, I didn’t limit my calories, I ate too much and I gained weight. That was my big fear when my pdoc wanted to switch me from Haldol to Zyprexa back in mid-March - the weight gain. I gained big amounts on Geodon and Abilify all the way up to 319 pounds at my highest, and I knew I’d gained before on Zyprexa. I came out fighting from the start this time around. I am bound and determined to lose my extra weight. I don’t have to fall victim to inevitable weight gain if I’m careful like I have been. Zyprexa actually suppresses my appetite a bit, so I’m lucky. It also gives me insomnia instead of making me tired, so I take in the morning and I have energy the whole day. I love it!"
175886108,"I think I started having hallucinogen persisting perception disorder attack right before I went to bed last night.

174325941,That just sounds like a bad idea all around. Pain pills won’t help psychosis in fact I think it would make it worse. The first time I was hospitalized I hurt myself and then spent about 10 days or so inpatient. They never gave me any pain pills in the hospital but when I got discharged they gave me some. I got 30 days of convalescent leave and jumped in my truck to drive 1081 miles home to Louisiana with my sisters and my mom. I wasn’t driving. I was in the back seat. I took one of those pain pills I think it was Percocet or something like that. It made me feel so weird. I felt like I was strung out on something. It was a horrible ride. I threw those damn things away and never took another one. You should really stay away from that stuff.

174325942,I had a profile on No Longer Lonely in my 20’s. Didn’t really talk to anyone I was too shy and didn’t meet anyone through it at all. It’s a dating site for people with mental illnesses. I’ve had like 2 dates in my 30’s. One was with a much younger girl I think she was 18. She asked for my number and I stopped by her house. She made tea and we sat in her bedroom and watched some tv and made out. The other was an old friend I had already sort of hooked up with we were at her 27th birthday party and we made out while swimming in an indoor pool. Pretty sad. My early 20’s were pretty sad as far as dating. I lived with a friend for 7 months before I flipped out and moved back home. We werent involved romantically. There was a few years there without anyone. I made out with a woman at a bar when I was 22 and then my mid 20’s I had 3 relationships one lasting off and on until my late 20’s. We recently started talking again but she lives in Texas now so I don’t know about us seeing each o

175886116,My voices with DID I recognize its kind of like if a family member talked to me it’s familiar. But also most of my DID voices tend to sound/be internal. Where as my schiz voices are definitely more external. I unfortunately cant always tell the difference between my schiz voices and my DID voices. My schiz voices do tend to be more nonsensical from what I’ve observed. But my alters say a lot of weird stuff too so I wouldnt use that as a measurement. But I have to ask are there any reasons why your doctor thinks you have DID? If so what are they??

175886120,"Hi Baroque, I am so sorry, it sounds like a terribly difficult time. Sometimes it's not just your responsibilities that are so impossible in a job, but the personalities. Working for a difficult person can make life miserable. Is possible to shrink that person's power to make you unhappy? Can you imagine yourself with a protective shield around yourself as you head to work, a bubble that keeps things from getting into your safe space? Is it a new job? Sometimes just all the new learning and challenges of a new job can seem overwhelming but over time, you learn the ropes and it gets easier. Exercise is a great reliever of stress and anxiety. And so is meditation. You can calm yourself at any moment just by taking very slow deep breaths. I find comfort in _NAME_ talks (podcasts), she addresses pain and healing in it's many forms. (It feels like therapy). She also leads meditations, which are very calming. For sleep, I take 3 mcg melatonin at night for sleep a half hour before bed and it helps me feel 
calm and get to sleep. Also pot or cbd oil are very calming. A tiny amount of pot before bed, keeps me calm the next day. And talking to someone who is caring about your concerns. Do have a friend you can talk to? We all need to feel heard, to get support sometimes. This is a good forum for expressing yourself, you might find that the issues that you've had with your friends and family are shared by many. Or there's always therapy for a deeper dive, which can be really useful. (You can do it online, so it's convenient). You will get through this, it will get easier. Be kind to yourself. Don't let all that negative noise from outside diminish your sense of yourself. You are love."

I am a bit less enthusiastic on this dose, but I want to try it like this now… I was suffering a bit on the 10 mgs… Otherwise I have my birthday today Love ya all! I appreciate, that you supported me so much through the years… But its a serious illness, its not a joke. I’ll try to pull out of it, but I lost everything since so long, that now Its hard. I am often quite passive and nothing helps. But whatever. Its a nice day for me today . Hugs"
175886148,I've been taking the meds I was finally prescribed. I hope it'll help.
174325955,Do you have research and science proofs for NAC with SZ?
175886149,I love how they just are so open. At my volunteering I was working in an office and this little girl came in from the workshop room and just started talking to me about all her teachers from school lol. It was so heartwarming
175886150,"I won’t say it’s impossible, but for most people who have (actual, not mis-diagnosed) schizophrenia life is not the same (ie. normal) any more as it was before the illness, and many of them never fully recover, even temporarily. The main problem tends to be the negative symptoms, which respond poorly to antipsychotic medication. _AT_MENTION_ is fortunate not to have the negative symptoms, and as of yet, I don’t think there is reason to assume he has schizophrenia. That said, I think medication may be useful, especially under times of stress. -A."
174325958,"Sz doesn’t cause crossed eyes or strabismus. I had strabismus since birth. Dr said its a defective eye muscle. I was social and was making eye contact with one eye before schizophrenia. I just have bad depth perception and difficulty driving. A severe brain concussion or brain surgery can do these, did you have any of these?"

Ill sleep until 5 pm sometimes then go back to bed at 7 and sleep 13 more hours… I also feel kinda horrible though, like im wasting the day when i sleep late or lay in bed all day. But what else is there to do??? i dont wanna go out and do stuff but staying home all day makes the depression worse. Focusing on anything is hell usually but there isnt even anything i would want to do tho anyway. Its a catch 22…"

174325959,"Hey hey, sza bipolar type here. I started having prodromal symptoms around age 15, and had my first experience of psychosis at 18. I was also hospitalized the first time at 18, and started my treatment for psychosis. After many therapy sessions, hospitalizations, meds and support, I am now 27. I’m working full time. I drive, pay my portion of household bills, and help out around the house. I did none of these for years after my first psychotic break. It’s taken a lot of work, setbacks, and frustration to get here but I’m glad I’m where I am. _PERSON_ isnt fun or easy to handle, and some days are definitely worse than others, but it’s not a life ruiner or death sentence. It’s all about knowing your limitations at the current time, but also slowly pushing and challenging yourself. Recovery for me isnt a destination, it’s a lifelong journey."

175886176,Apart from looks and acceptance I can’t believe how real it makes hell out to be. Like before this disease I wasn’t so convinced of hell but now I feel like omg what if its a possibility for ETERNITY!! Alone… How can I shift this type of thinking is there a way. It really does impact my stress levels I don’t necessarily think that hell is wat WILL happen but I can’t seem to ignore wat if cos it’s a big wat if since we are talking about eternity here. And being all alone. I seem to have it in my head that maybe my mental state energy is wat carries on into another world. _PERSON_ I die. And there’s no evidence against it. This world is a bit of a mystery wen it comes to afterlife.

I talked to pdoc about it. We’re going to get me on meds. I don’t like the idea but I think I have no other options but to put my faith in the meds. I have exhausted all of my other resources and I’m still struggling. For now SO sleeps next to me or watches while I am out. Wish my luck finding a prescriber.

175886209,"For me, psychosis showed me my thinking patterns, and resultant emotions that I had not been solving but pushing aside. And so they built up until they resurfaced through psychosis. To me it’s like my attic is so full of boxes that need to be sorted that the ceiling broke. And that is psychosis to me. Maybe our fears are exaggerated like a laughing mirror on purpose in order to startle me into change. But I don’t know how I feel about that, using fear to create a drive in me :(( Maybe that’s just life… For me. Fear is not the only drive though, fortunately, but it does seem to be one of them."

175886214,I was happy and careless. Being an only child and spoiled was bliss but I woke up to a cruel reality later in life.
175886215,"No SZ and DID are two completely different diagnoses. (Also just so everyone knows Multiple Personality Disorder is an outdated term) DID comes from severe child abuse. Also another thing that’s a requirement is dissociation. So basically that can look like complete black outs/ out of body feelings. Also DID requires a completely separate identity. For example My name is E, I am 26, I identify as nonbinary, my hobbies include videogames, Dnd and drawing. I’m also pretty introverted. One of my alters is named A. He is about my age, and identifies as male. His hobbies and interests include mainly fashion and shopping. He is incredibly extroverted. (Names changed for our privacy) So to put it simply we are entirely different people. And also these identities need to coexist. So how you were before and during psychosis wouldn’t count as separate identities. If you have any other questions feel free to ask"

174325963,Yes! That's a big part of what happened. I'm so much better now but my mind still wanders but it may be more the ptsd/dissociative stuff. I'm also taking risperdal .5mg 2x day right now so that's helping.

175886237,"I don’t have panic attacks, but diaphragmatic breathing helps me a lot. It slows my thoughts so they aren’t as rapid fire. I also find that maybe the oxygen to my brain helps me think a little clearer. I find the deep breathing is most effective when I can get ahead of the anxiety, just like the idea when you’re trying to get ahead of pain with a headache. But it still helps when I’m over the edge as well. I like to do box breathing, which is breathe in 4, hold for 4, breathe out 4, hold for 4, and repeat.

How Do We Prove It?: An Updated Review and Overview. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Song, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of nervous and mental disease , Jul 2019 Depressive symptoms can occur at any point in the duration of schizophrenia. However, we are unable to predict if or when depression will occur in schizophrenic patients. Simultaneously, the standard treatment of depression in schizophrenic patients is the combination of antidepressants and antipsychotics, which has been minimally effective for most patients. Based on several studies, we hypothesized the existence of depressive-type schizophrenia and reviewed the substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis of depressive-type schizophrenia. Simultaneously, we propose technical methods to explore the neuropathology of depressive-type schizophrenia in order to identify the disease during its early stages and to predict h

All they see is some guy buying a loaf of bread or some Cheerio’s or something. Are you having problems with specific people? You can’t read minds, you don’t really know what anyone’s thinking or what they think of you.

We only have a bed, 1 couch and 1 big seat, and 2 media stands right now. 1 desk that's fiances. We are going to a flea market today to look at furniture. But I really want that dining nook for sure.

175886291,Sort of reminds me what happened with my ex. He worked for an operative who killed himself. It was on CNN. My ex’s twitter was hacked by a Russian tag. He was interviewed by the House of Representatives for about 20 pages. I somehow feel this connects to me since I had images in my mind of him being taken to Israel to be killed. Weird things indeed. I still think you have sz. Weird things just happen during this illness. If that is what I have at all. Didn’t they figure you were honest? It’s weird because I can’t access any of my old email accounts back when I may have been accused a terrorist. If the gvt wanted to get into your email they could without you telling your logins. But they might have been just trying to see the truth? My friend who was also sz told me how the gvt interviewed him as well. So I think it’s not uncommon. He was befuddled by it. Didn’t really want to share it with me.

175886312,"I know that I enjoy gaming and if I don’t enjoy playing as much I still enjoy seeing people play games and enjoy themselves on twitch. Gaming has become a more intellectually stimulating thing for me where I support the industry and genre’s through crowd funded efforts and generally just having good taste and telling devs what I think about games. I know its not much of an accomplishment but having a company that did a good kickstarter and being part of that process as a backer and cheering on their success has been very uplifting for me. Even if I don’t have the energy to grind and hack n slash as I used to, I still get to contribute to the thing that helped me through so many hard times and kick it forward for the next generation of gamers.

Chicken croquette curry is a Japanese style spicy chicken curry stew with a large slab of fried mashed potato on top. My parents think my life will be wasted except on food and that I should focus on exercising and loosing weight and “being healthy.” I feel I want to make a difference, though, and not by having constant episodes but through books and learning about people and meeting people. They are just not going to let me rest until I “do the right thing” which is to loose weight. But anyways, I am making plans for my death like by making friends and waiting for my e

As we became more advanced and the luxury of being at the top of the food chains benefits came forward, we started realizing, holy ????! Life doesn’t last forever. Thus gods, philosophies and religions. Its all delusion. so you, a schizophrenic, telling me you think god sent you here for a special purpose doesn’t exactly surprise. If you want my non biased, religion friendly advise -god did not send you here on a mission, and demons/demonic powers are not distracting you from such things. Despite what was said by another, yes you can think your way out of the illness to an extent. By simply not entertaining these delusions. People may disagree and say only medication can sa
ve you. Bullsht. You either do something or you don’t, same applies to your thought. And especially in your case, because you say the sane atheistic version of you is currently dominating. So all the more so you have a choice to entertain this fantasy or choose to join reality and move forward with your life. The choice is entirely within your power based on how your describing your mental state. (Its called neuroplasticity) Short version: yes its delusional."

I've used it a bit like therapy sometimes and not really gave a $#%^ if people accept me or not. I've found it so much easier to express myself. Especially in 'the other place'.

175886526,And thank you on that _AT_MENTION_.
175886527,Hi. According to the medical profession there should be no difference but from my experience I have always found the brand better but the generic still work well so I would say give it a go and see how you get on. _PERSON_
175886528,yes and it’s supposed to raise serotonin too
174326018,"hey _AT_MENTION_ . I have imaginary conversations with myself a lot, they are accompanied by painful rage/anguish. It’s not fun. I’m seeing my GP next Tues & will probably change back to Zyprexa. Also trialling the supplements on the home page here for schizophrenia. I manage to work & have a social life. Though, I really enjoy time alone & just hanging out with my cat. How is your mental health these days, how are you going?"
175886529,"thats horrible, did you report to it the police."
175886530,Not a bad effort to have gotten through all you have. I’m sure there’s more fun in your future so with some help and modern medicine we can get you there _AT_MENTION_ !
175886531,Plan on drawing a winter scene later
175886532,You said you could not do landscaping because of your health.
175886533,Dont think so. Inositol and Uridine come to mind for mood elevating properties.
175886534,"It is your choice. As long as you see that it is harmful and you actually do have a choice. I think it is a form of self-harm, but i cant force you. Hope you find the strength some day."

175886536,The pdoc can’t tell your husband anything without your consent. It’s against the law. Even if he thinks you are suicidal he can only then call the authorities not your husband.

175886539,"I got a special delivery at my corner shop of a new brand of tobacco called Riverstone, I don’t know if it’s poison or medicine, have been smoking it though because it’s cheap. It just materialized. I don’t know if I’m wasting my money on coffee and cigarettes, I don’t buy groceries."
175886540,"I’ve had it for 6 years. I spent my first two years with the disease very delusional and ended up homeless for a little bit then in jail in a solitary confinement cell for 5 months, then with medicine and time the delusions went away. I finally found a medicine that doesn’t have horrible side effects and the only problem I have now are hallucinations, mainly voices. Most often the voices are nice but sometimes they get really mean and it’s very harrowing. I’ll go months with very few problems then experience a week or two of hell."
175886541,I only tell those I trust about my mental illness. It is too risky to go jabbing on about it to anyone right now. Depression and anxiety are losing _USER_ID_ and becoming normalized which is great but psychosis? Not so much
175886542,"Now that I look back when I was in a period of psychosis when I wrote that… I was on the website, and the words got possessed and were telling me things and I was able to read the hallucinations… not a good experience, but I just realized that. I don’t want to go back on that website, theres no need especially when my mind is/was that sick. I don’t remember anything that I read and I became obsessive since none of the stuff I was reading on that site was processing right for me"
175886543,That's not too bad. I can see my doctor without paying anything. Maybe think about getting another doctor closer to you or do video chats on the computer. A lot of doctors and such are doing it.
175886544,I think the same thing. Day is so difficult. So boring
175886545,"I get so busy that I forget my meds without setting multiple reminders on my smart devices. Other than that, no issues."

175886557,"No I can't be like this. I'll take an olanzepine. Struggle. Until it gets better. If it doesn't, at least we tried. _USER_ID_: I wish I had a cogentin to take with the olanzepine. I took 50mg diphenhydramine, 50mg seroquel, 50mg atenolol, 2 benzos, 10mg melatonin. I'll take an olanzepine too. I just need to think less and vegetate for now. My neck really hurts from the ski accident. I'm not gonna take advil cuz that's too many pills so I'll just deal with it."
175886558,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ I never _NAME_ much as a kid or enjoyed it. I became interested in art and creativity only _AT_MENTION_-25 years old. Now I like most aspects of it. But think I’d be better if I started earlier
175886559,I know _AT_MENTION_ but cold turkey is the only way I can quit because I can quit really easy chewing the nicotine gum but when I ever try to wean or cut off the nicotine gum I go back to smoking…same with the patch…I can’t afford hypnosis and don’t have the car to make it to the far away city for hypnosis or groups…

I would really like to have a penpal. I have two friends now with whom I correspond, but their responses takes days or weeks and it is never very deep.

It is hard to trust people when I want to because i get these insights that usually, do come true. But there is a darkness in my heart that is not my own. It is stealing my energy and altering my vibrations. I’m trying to talk myself out of this but it is hard when i’ve had these visions. I am very self aware at the moment, and usually i am. Which . am i really sza? I see references everywhere i go. The spiritual inner warfare is real and i feel like my mind is being programmed as mental and psychic torment.

174326031,"So I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia after being admitted into a mental health hospital…however, I really don’t think I have schizophrenia…I think it’s just paranoia, for example, say I’m about to leave my house to go somewhere…I’ll check the on indicator on the stove to make sure it’s off, then I’ll check it again and again and again until I absolutely have to leave the house because if I don’t check that it’s off, it’s gonna start a fire, checking the stove constantly gets tiresome but I can’t stop myself. Another thing is whenever I’m in a public place or even in my home I’m automatically looking around for cameras in fear that someone has set up cameras wherever i go to watch me and for lack of a better word “spy” on me.

Once I got to the exam room the doctor came in listened to my lungs and heart, told me my TSH numbers were good, asked if I was feeling better - I said no, and started to tell her what was going on, she stopped me and repeated that my TSH was good and then told me my discharge papers would have the name of another doctor that specializes in POTS and I should go try him out. Bye. I was with her for less than 5 minutes! Insult to injury, check out was maybe 1 minute to 2 minutes worth of time - the receptionist took my slip which only had my stats (height, weight, dob, address), typed my name into the computer and printed my visit report with the other doctor's info on it.... meaning, this was prepared before I was even seen. The doctor had no plan to hear me out, help me figure anything out (like, What was I feeling? What were my symptoms? Had there been any improvements? And 
why after supplementing with 5000 IUs of vitamin D for 8 months was my vitamin D level still under the normal range? I wasn't even asked if I had enough of my thyroid meds until my next visit - which I do not... didn't realize that until I left!). I am so tired and frustrated. I chose this doctor because she is a functional medicine endocrinologist and have read that functional medicine doctors are more holistic and try to get to the root cause.... not this one.

Thus, deep down you believe that you feel that you are not wanted here on this site, and that you have learned enough to leave, which is why your voices (subconscious) is telling you this. You are much loved and respected on this site, and we never stop learning. By being here you can feel validated and continue to learn. Understanding that there are other reasons for coming here could enter your subconscious and the voices will change to meet them, as if you read your responses in this topic you found your voices changed to meet how you felt once you had approval from your friends and admirers. This is proof in fact that your voices are part of your subconscious and that you hear what you expect to hear. For example: After getting some support and friendship from the people on this site. Voices are like hearing what you guess other people think of you, so once you had 
some support you realised subconsciously that it wasn’t true that you felt you needed to leave and then your voices changed accordingly. Hope this gives you insight!"

When I was 23-25, I was studying a double major in History and Sociology at a really good University in my county. Unfortunately in my second year, the psychosis just got worse. I graduated however, and got a 1st class in Sociology and an upper second in History. If I did not have my psychosis return when it did, my original plan was to take the education level as high as possible. Not the case because of SZ. Two months after graduating I was in hospital for weeks. I tried to re-engage with this path, but been out of education for 7 years, I could only secure a place on a Masters degree, and not the pHD, as I needed to prove myself again It might be something I can do again one day, but SZ took a lot of wind out of my sails, and it will take a miracle to get back to the same place of conditioned intellectual abilities"

174326049,"I have a coeliac gene from my 23andme test identified and occasionally get a rash which I spotted on google images which match mine. The rash is called gluten rash or dermatitis herpetiformis. I was reading about it and found out that sometimes children with coeliac disease have delayed puberty and growth problems. This happened to me in childhood and I had growth hormone to trigger puberty. The doctors at the time did not spot my coeliac disease as the cause of my growth problems and I have lived unknowing about my coeliac disease up until last night. I am not officially diagnosed by a doctor as yet, but it requires a stomach biopsy and a blood test, but the rash fits and so do my genes; and it is covid time so am reluctant to go to the nhs and a doc while this is going on. There is also a link between schizophrenia and coeliac disease confirming my bias towards my self diagnosis The science says that if gluten is not removed from the diet the chances of getting bowel cancer or hodgkins lymphoma i
s increased, so although my symptoms have been mild throughout my life as of last night I have quit the gluten. It is not so difficult as there are plenty of alternatives in the supermarket these days. I have a crate of beer to get rid of in my store cupboard Does anyone know which antipsychotics contain gluten as many medications do?"

Even if I had a different job and did this as a volunteer, it’d be rewarding for everybody. My friend does do it for a living. He works for the state doing peer support speciality. He took a 50 hour course I think to get certified. I wish you luck _AT_MENTION_ I just think it’d be rewarding and helpful and structure forming and maybe financially beneficial possibly as well as it’d give me enough purpose it might crush my delusions, as well as I like meeting new people."

Very cool that you’re into recording as well. How do you find Logic to work with?

174326037,"Yeah, that was my problem. I was too aware of alcohol."
174326045,Yes I agree. The doctors believe that a short medicated life is better than a long psychotic one. I’ll probably get flagged for criticising meds though
175886660,I went through that too. Craziness. I had to recall all my past sins and renounce them one by one and when I’d renounce the sin the “exorcists” would command the demon associated with that sin to leave my body. I threw up. It was weird. Foolishness. I didn’t know any better. Thing is I know how to read and I’ve read the Bible thoroughly and that ???? ain’t in there.

175886664,I like the fact that a good chunk of the posters so far are in the 35-54 age bracket. I think it’s important for the youngest bracket to learn and perhaps get some guidance and relief from those middle-age folks and their advice. I was diagnosed _PERSON_ at the age of 39…I was a late bloomer to the party.
175886665,how worse is it?
175886666,"The TV only bothered me when I was really psychotic my first one or two years with the illness. It doesn’t bother me anymore in the least, I usually have it on for distraction. I find it helps keep the voices away."
175886667,I think the best thing you can do is tell your psychiatrist all of this. Maybe you need a different antipsychotic or a higher dose.

175886671,"Recently I felt depressed every morning when I woke up. It’s been two weeks and started to affect my moods during the day. I booked a session with a psychologist at a psychology clinic. Then I talked about it with a Sz friend. She listened to me and then doubted if seeing a psychologist would be helpful, because she thought my depression could be a sign that the dose of Olanzapine which I am taking daily wasn’t enough. I think what my Chinese Sz friend said about cause of my depression is right. What do you think?"

I so wish I could take it back. I remember things from before too, when alive, yet I can barely keep track of my activity on an hour to hour basis.

We’ve been having such lovely summer like weather here that I was just not prepared for more of the cold stuff. But we definitely need the moisture. My sister has completed her move back to my town. We’ve been spending time together the last couple of days. We’ve gone out to eat and gone for coffee and she keeps dragging me to the wildlife refuge to go for walks. I can’t quite make the whole mile yet, but I’m close. Pretty soon we’ll be doing the 3 mile loop like it’s nothing. I love the refuge. It’s so beautiful. All the water. All the birds. And we keep getting to see a group of turtles sunning themselves on the banks of the canal. I still haven’t gotten my mattress yet. There was some confusion on the original delivery. I am expecting the mattress on Thursday, then I can start sleeping in my apartment. I do everything else in my apartment already. I go there in the m

Everything is going fine with my meds and my illness, no side effects basically and no symptoms except anxiety and some stubborn underlying depression that never really seems to go away all the way. But it’s livable. The anxiety is the worst when I have to deal with strangers, like the general public, and I just try to be brave and realize it’s hard for everyone.

174326066,"Zyprexa has worked well for me. Best results so far other than Clozaril, at one time I was taking both plus Xanax, that combo helped me to get back to work. I eventually removed the Clozaril of my own choice, (yay, no more drooling!) which was a struggle but I made it through. Removed Xanax from my regimen after 20 years on it. Again, struggle at first but I’ve adjusted. Went off all meds for a year, bad decision, paid for it. Back on Zyprexa(20mg) and Zoloft(50mg) for 6 months now, could be better, could be worse, overall better than no meds. Zyprexa causes excess sweating, sensitivity to heat both in me, and of course weight gain. The weight gain is something I take very seriously, the best way I can describe Zyprexa is a 2000 calorie pill. Even with strict exercise routine and intermittent fasting diet, 16 hours a day with no food (no breakfast, late lunch of one banana, full dinner, and snack before bed) I’ve gained more than I prefer. I was up to 250 lbs many years ago, I will never get ab
ove 200 again, hovering at 175 now. Carrying that much extra weight is a death sentence for many. Honestly hoping to dial the Zyprexa back to 15mg soon, the heat sensitivity is limiting my activity too much. I need connection with nature more than meds. Best thing I’ve ever changed is my diet. I eat as many fresh fruits and vegetables as possible, limit all meats, red meat especially. Whole wheat grains are essential, limited dairy. Also I dont avoid fried foods, I feel plenty of the misinformation on fried foods is soon to be debunked. No meds have made near as much of a difference than diet and exercise, period."

174326069,"I became more excited, paranoid and restless from Abilify. So can be. Abilify is a different type of med than Zyprexa though. And i had akathisia with a normal dose of Haldol, which also feels restless, not sitting still, excited, moving my leg all the time, etc. Would contact the pdoc about it."

175886793,I don’t really remember when I first tried taking it in the morning I was still trying to work and I would get to work and would have to lie down and take a nap so I just took it all at night. I never thought to tell my doctor I wasn’t taking it as prescribed. Just didn’t know any better. When I finally started taking it in the morning again I wasn’t working but I didn’t have that problem anymore so it just kind of went away on its own after a while.

175886812,"Hello - That must be a terrible situation for you to be in. I've got a question: do you have an eating disorder, or is the weight loss likely due to stress and anxiety? I'm no specialist, but those sound like two very possible causes to the issue... but would have varying types of treatment. Likely they forgot to inform the therapist about it. He was very kind to offer that to you! My suggestion, if you haven't found anything online - text 741741 - the crisis hotline. They cover all sides of any health concern, and while they may not be able to directly help you with the weight loss concern, they will be able to connect you with the right people. Simply text 'hey' or 'hi' to that number, and it will ask you what the crisis is, then connect you with a professional. Hope this helps, we're here for you - keep fighting - you've got this!"

They already know bits and pieces but I want them to understand more.

They know about my life of being employed for more than 36 years, and I tell them of my experiences as an addict but they don’t know about my life being hospitalized for 8 months and other subsequent multiple hospitalizations.

175886878,"I thought you might be interested in this news, on an existing drug called fenofibrate. To boost synaptic function—a well-documented problem in people with schizophrenia—the team gave mice a drug called fenofibrate, which activates PPAR?. Fenofibrate is already taken by millions of people every day to help control cholesterol and fat levels in the blood. The researchers showed that the drug helped alleviate brain and behavioral abnormalities in various mouse models of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, they can’t just use fenofibrate at human-safe doses because: However, because fenofibrate does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, the scientists had to administer very high doses of the drug. That approach would be risky in people, says _PERSON_, since fenofibrate can sometimes seriously damage muscle tissue. To avoid that potential side effect, drug developers may have to refine the chemistry of fenofibrate or discover new agents that activate PPAR?. “To test the therapeutic strategy in 
people, we need more drugs that penetrate the brain for clinical trials,” _PERSON_ says. But I think this sort of research at least shows that they are working on, and there is the possibility of, drugs that actually change the brain and help it have a more normal connectivity. Although I am sure it is a long way out, there are new technologies to deliver drugs more directly to the brain, and new ways to predict with computers what properties new chemical structures might have. So I expect something like this will eventually be developed in people. Neuroscience News – 5 Mar 21 Anti-Hyperlipidemia Drug Improves Brain Connectivity Schizophrenia -...

174326087,"How do you get to your information? I can understand how schizophrenia can appear to have an impact on your analysis and evaluation of information but does it matter? If my thought is disorganised but arrives where intended, how is getting to cat from catalyst different to coming to it from dog? Anti psychotics took vast portions of my working memory, spacial reasons, auditory feedback loops we use to retain information, much of my ability to process complex, multiple sources of information eg writing and watching. I suffered from 2 drug induced psychotic episodes that were publicly humiliating but non violent in nature and was placed on a treatment order. I was ordered to be on paliperidone injections for 6 to 9 months but refused treatment after 3, I was detained for a month to be monitored but it seemed the damage had already been done. I linked my information through words, sounds, shapes or pictures but all of my words, visual imagery and my body’s rhythm which gave me a bit of a beat in my 
head had gone; I have become aware of these thought processes I have running constantly I’m sure we all do, they are our beliefs, desires, fears or insecurities. Many of my processes involved word specific explainations of why this action benefits me how it relates to the art of war and how a child could apply it in their life, I worked in a school so I picked someone I knew and explained my action’s benefit in appropriate terminology. I have obsessive compulsive disorder so any missed word or sentence or expression left me repeating that mistake until I felt even, if I did not it would manifest in my body moving in unnatural ways which would result in pain so seldom would I leave a mistake to be acknowledged by my body, it would still need to be finalised but the mind, even if 3 days later. These explainations would link to memories reaffirming my beliefs and giving me motivation to proceed as planned. I’m not sure if other people are like that but losing access to these pathways affected my ability to 
proceed. I was unaware of how much motivation I experienced through explaination. The medication slowed my thought processes so severely that it became a registrable, vocalised, auditory hallucination; prior to this I cannot recall any thought which I would have considered irrational or at least harmful to be repeating. I always tried to end one idea before carrying in to something corresponding, unless it was verified. The medication did give me time to correct some connections which were being acknowledged with no way of understanding them, eg I linked all of my memories good and bad of past relationships to my most recent which resulted in numerous memories triggering the same negative response. Although intervention was necessary I believe it could have been achieved through thought alone. I believe that impulses can be controlled if you identify the trigger. Since coming off of the medication I have had to revert back to my original intuitive response system, I have had to modify parts of my behaviour an
tipsychotics altered like movement, speech, who I was seeking to impress and my motivations behind that. It inverted my values, meaning I was acting in spite of someone rather than for them. They gave me multiple independent personalities which were attempting to control my intuitive responses, eg what I chose to do before I think about what I want to do… they would encourage me to be lazy. I have always practiced a particularly rigid manner of thought. I would always remove my emotions from the equation and recieve the information in order to process it. When another personality spoke, at first I would feel an unexplainable emotion, but after a few months off of the medication they began to respond like children. They would ask me to explain why I would move in a certain way, why do you not want people to look at you, why do you walk on the left side of the street? It was similar to building rapport with a child, eventually they just became silent, just me, repeating the benefits or consequences of an acti
on. I’ve been off of anti psychotics for almost 5 months now and have regained mostly all of my original motor functions, as well as my sinus rhythm and other autonomic bodily functions which are becoming autonomic… But my central nervous system, cardiovascular and endocrine systems are still not functioning as they were before. However I do find myself alone in my head, deciding because I chose to rather than reacting to an emotional response. Martial arts is my passion, the permanent movement profile I am in allowed me to shape all foreign influences into copies of myself, practicing the exact same thought as I, or they were denied and their thought was left unacknowledged and incomplete. I have elements of martial arts introduced into all areas of my life that give me unquestioned command of my schizophrenic thought. Movement was my most defining attribute, but command can also be seized by identifying and defining our influences, the way we structure sentences, or a specific desire, fear or memory whi
ch is unique to you, something that will always remain unchanged that you can weave into every waking moment. Having a personal memory will also invite known people as conferring influences and knowing how someone interacts helps your mind to produce a more realistic experience. It is counterintuitive to find something that separates you from the rest of the world, but having an undefined number of commonalities, links you with anyone who you think “they are just like me” I used to think this about anyone, animals, public figures I found common ground with anyone. It is a good way to think if fostering growth and development in relationships but not to experience a hypothetical feeling of compatibility if resulting in an emotional response that you attach to. When ideas of what we think this person would think in this situation evolve, it opens us up to too many variables in our manners of thought. I definitely believe the way we interact with these thoughts can carry with it, a physiological effect as we
ll as the psychological effects. However I know that our brains are powerful things and some people are far to quick to jump at a medicinal solution rather than attempting alteration of our thought, through thought. I was raised with a positive belief system and it was easier to find my way back, but some are raised with a negative manner of thought, acting with negativity to drive rather than positivity. Even that is something you need to be honest with yourself about. There are levels of thought, some may be so deep seeded you wouldn’t even identify with them. The only way to get at them is through thought. Breathing through my nose was the first thing I noticed I had stopped doing. It helped me to regain some of my lost attributes."

I had severe side effects, from random tingling in my hands and feet to horrible mental and cognitive function. The effects this drug had on my mental state will never outweigh any positive changes it had to my migraines. This drug made me feel like I was truly going crazy. Iâ??m very open with my loved ones about my struggles with my mental health but this drug scared me into silence. I was not warned that it could have any side effects on my mental state or cognition so I only assumed that I was starting to go insane. Inability to speak sentences, say the right words, or worst of all - trouble explaining how I was feeling. Biggest mood swings Iâ??ve ever experienced. Episodes of being incredibly manic, to then not getting out of bed for da
ys. It all got worse each week with the dosage increases. I couldnâ??t finish the simplest of tasks and eventually had to take the semester off of school, before understanding it was the drug causing all of these issues. Thankfully a close friend suggested to look up the side effects ONLY in response to my tingly feet and hands, and thatâ??s when I read and realized this drug was causing the month of internal chaos. I have such hatred towards this drug. PLEASE be aware and prepared for the effects this drug COULD have on your mind before starting it."

There’s nothing wrong with being you _NAME_. If you have the gift of intelligence that’s ok. If you don’t fit in cos you’re a nerd well I’m a nerd too and I don’t fit in either. It’s ok.

I do have to say I was more mood stable on the percocet cause the pain was better controlled, I worked during that time too with 3 kids 5 and under, 55 hour weeks. But once they took the percocet halfway thru the working, I filed for SSDI at the end of 2008. Got approved after 1 appeal and a lawyer in early 2010. I may be getting back on the better pain meds, but pain clinic here is so backed up, on a waiting list for June to see if anything opens up then.

175887051,"_NAME_- I am very sorry to hear about your situation. I was in a similar situation about 27 years ago. The likelihood of him changing (not just ""promising"" to change when threatened with the end of your one-sided relationship - in which it sounds like he ""wins"" in almost everything) is extremely low. The only person you can change is you! Sometimes, change is painful, especially when we hold onto the ""what could have been"" images in our heads. Yep, I have been-there-and-done-that too. I don't know if you prefer to read, listen, or watch, but there are resources to help you begin to face this kind of thing, get out, and not become a victim again. Let me know which you prefer, and I will share some I like with you. In the meantime, be very careful and take care of yourself. You are in a potentially volatile situation and may need to get out quickly (bt-dt also)! It may behoove you to find out how to contact your nearest battered women's shelter because there is a great possibility of that happe
ning! Even if you think he never would. By what you have said, it could happen in an unexpected instant, and then he will turn it back on you to feel ashamed and believe that it was all your fault. Please don't let that happen. There is a fine line between getting some bruises and having permanent brain damage or death. I know it sounds extreme to say this, but it happens more than you realize. The least that these kinds of people do to their partners is to mentally beat them into a self-deprecating, self-hating, and anxiety-ridden pulp. It would be better to get out now. However, I realize that only YOU can decide to do that. I hope you don't wait until it is too late. Just be ready for the fact that he WILL beg for you to come back, and you will have to make yourself immune to those selfish pleas of his. You CAN do it! And you CAN have a good relationship after you learn what to watch out for and how to make yourself into someone who will not be a likely target for these kinds of people ever again. I went t
hrough it and have been happily married for 25 years now. It is completely different from what I had ever experienced in a relationship before. Take Care, _NAME_"

175887077,"Actually, I’ve found that maintaining a purely watchful or aware state when undergoing psychosis is one of the best technqiues I have for safely getting through it. I discovered it when I told myself one day that I would try to meditate during one. I had been doing meditation for about a month so was familiar with the process. When I did, the voices became stronger and more powerful in my head — but I just watched. There were physical effects too. Like gut constriction and difficulty breathing. But I knew they couldnt harm me by stopping breathing because no matter how long my breath was stopped, I would become unconscious and autostart breathing again.

It’s a life lesson and an experience that only 1% of the population really understands, and I believe strongly that it can shape you to be better if you can put it to one side and not let it defeat you. I have had so many set backs and had to start again from scratch each time. What I have now I am really grateful for and it’s hard fought. You really have to live the best life you can, and whatever happens you can only do your best to see it through, and there is no shame in that."

174326138,"In the future, it is best if you build a connection with the person before disclosing your illness. This way they will have gotten a taste of who you really are as a person and if they are a decent human being, it shouldn’t affect their decision all that much to have you in their lives (assuming they like you as a person) This is something A psychologist had told me to do from that point on, as I would tell people right away that I had Bipolar Disorder and I could have seen many times in the past, that these people would think certain things about me and distance themselves from me or completely ex me out of their lives. When I took the Pdocs advice, and let the person get to know me, especially a romantic interest, I would disclose after some time when I am comfortable with them. It has never backfired on me. Never had I known a girl to tell me it’s over because of my illness, having shown who I was first. Granted, I have Bipolar and not Schizophrenia, which may pose less of a threat in the mi
nds of others, I am sure this approach will work for you or anyone else in the future just as well. You have to remember that even though it is withholding information at the beginning of a relationship, you are not lieing to the other person, you are simply allowing a connection to build before revealing this information about yourself, so that they may see who you really are, before forming an image of you in their minds."
175887143,"# Consciously training our sense of gratitude is good for mental health Research shows that people who live their lives with a sense of gratitude are happier and less likely to suffer from psychological issues. A study by the University of Twente shows that training yourself to be more thankful can help people to feel better and increase mental resilience. This is the first time that this has been demonstrated convincingly. Professor of Positive Mental Health _NAME_ explains: “Previously, research into exercises to train people’s sense of gratitude had not been able to discern much effect. So we decided to study the effect of a six-week training. The results of the study were published today in the Journal of Happiness Studies .”"

I eat throughout the whole day, junk, and have gotten even worse about cooking with him gone. I now drink straight from the bottle every night (which in some ways I think is better, I don’t fill a cup and then feel pressured to finish the cup even when I feel ill, and it saves dishes too) and while I have not gotten drunk since he’s left I have been getting at least tipsy almost every night. In summary, I have been drinking too much. Last night I ordered and drank an entire 32 oz of _NAME_. Not only is the alcohol bad but the excess calories are terrible too. I don’t understand ho

175887174,Your old pdoc was a crook. The maximum doses exist because they’re safe and most effective in those ranges. You were probably pumping your body with so much synthetics that it was making you sicker and not really addressing symptoms. For a better outcome you need sensible doses and therapy.
175887175,"How this will work You will tell your general doctor,who will do a neurological evaluation and determine whether you have abnormal findings. They will either order the MRI, or refer you to a neurologist (depends on your health history and insurance. Sometimes a GP can’t order an MRI) The neurologist, if you go,will ask a lot of questions that seem unrelated, and do another MRI. You will get the MRI. It will be scary, so take someone along for comfort. If you have abnormal findings,you will find out within a day. If you have normal findings, you will find out within a week. If you have a brain tumor: Go to a trusted university hospital with a good reputation for your type of tumor. Ask what your treatment options are. Ask what your doctor’s record is for this type of tumor. If it is not OUTSTANDING request a better doctor. This is your brain, it isn’t the time to be polite and take chances on an inexperienced doctor If you are in the US 4. Find out the cost of treatment up front, and what your 
insurance will cover. If your insurance will not cover the treatment you feel is best, SUE THEM. They will cave eventually. 5. During treatment, always ask for an itemized bill. Fight every item on the list. There is a good chance a lot of the items will be dropped or reduced Keep track of the names of your treatment team. If you see a name on the bill that is unfamiliar, refuse to pay that part. Doctors do a shady thing where they bill themselves for a consult because they walked into your room while you were unconscious for five minutes. If you fight it, you won’t have to pay."
174326155,"It’s all severe There are different levels I guess though My first 3 psychosis were focused on pure paranoia telepathy voices, people talking about me and the odd thing like government following me or machines talking to me or birds The severity of my sisters schizophrenia was much worse I never saw it like that until after she died It was the movement as language element, what she called body language That is at the centre of it With more bizarre behaviour like dressing strangely (top and knickers only) or undressing in public, ( rolling naked in the mud in the park) praying in the road, absconding, etc Laughing odly I had no idea what she was going on about or what made her like that.

175887193,"Clonus? What is that? A auto-immune disease? I guess some diseases you just can’t beat, but on the other hand you can hear stories about people who like broke their back in three places and managed to fight their way to recovery, but it takes a whole lot of determination and willpower to take on such a task, and I’m not saying it’s possible for everyone. I guess you should focus on small goals and victories. Like trying to make tomorrow a little better than today. I find from personal experience if I make good choices for myself today, that kind of determines how tomorrow will be, and ofcourse the opposite holds true. If I don’t make good choices today that will affect me tomorrow. I can understand your bitterness. I think all of us schizos have felt it at some point. Thinking what our lives would be if it weren’t for the disease and if we didn’t have to take drugs. But there’s a lot of psychology in it. Like in the example of blindness. If you were born blind you would not miss seein
g. But for those who saw first and went blind later it can be bitter. However they could also choose to think. “At least I was able too see up until this point.” I know it’s not much consolation, but we always have a choice in how we look at things, but it can be real hard to think positive in a difficult situation. I hope tomorrow will be a better day for you laetitia."

I get the injection again on Friday. I'm afraid that it will happen again. I'm doing well right now though... I made a phone appointment with my doctor on the 24th. He's gonna phone me so I can refill the zopiclone, vyvanse, atenolol.. I'm gonna write down some stuff to say to him about how I'm doing and then it will be good for a month."

174326162,"_PERSON_ had a history with supplements and in my opinion and upon trial and error, and a little research ive personally come to the conclusion that its usually best to get nutrients from their natural source (i.e. Eating the food directly). Getting a higher dose of the desired substance in pill form sounds good in theory, but some times theres problems with, for example, absorption of said nutrient because it does not come with the other nutrients which it naturally occurs with in the whole food. For example you can take an iron pill but if its not accompanied by vitamin c its very poorly absorbed, therefore a whole food like spinach which naturally contains both would be better. Our bodies are built around nature because thats the environment in which we evolved. Thus processed supplements (not including pharmaceuticals like aps which are useful in intervention) are, i think, probably not as ideal as consuming the whole food itself."

I do believe their ghosts and not illuminati gods like they say they are. I know from scripture that the devil lies so I dont believe a thing they say but they make me feel its true with feelings and fear
174326168,most of the time i dont even have the opportunity to talk with people because everyone in my small circle knows that im schizo and im sure they gossiped it around and everyone who asks about me they get told since i live in a really small town. i went about 10 years without a girlfriend but the first year i moved away to live in a group home for my sza i got a girlfriend. its stupid how bad people treat me here like they dont want to have anything to do with me. which in turn causes me to not like people to a certain extent because of the _USER_ID_ that they hold.

I couldnt have been a doctor anyways because im low functioning and dont like people much. Im not really that intelligent and im poor. I think usa is pretty accommodating and covid makes it easier like _PERSON_ got rid of mcat for 1 year for example. Part of my delusions is i was a doctor in a past life/parallel universe or at least tried to be one. I get dreams about it. Im a huge mess and got stories and embarassed myself. I was mainly in it for the money. I want to help people but had too many negative experiences in life. Why push myself? I think i ended up as a physicist and engineer in a couple of my lives. Everyone thinks im delusional. I got into the best schools in my past lives. I have a lot of tragedy. I rather avoid bringing it up. I just wanna get cured/recover and live a long, private life. I get psychic downloads. Im a Christian, but probably was a high ranking illuminati member in a p
ast life. At least my delusions feed that belief. Like i had thoughts i ran the illuminati but i dont. Its a lie. People say its not real, but i converse and met aliens which may or may not be real. See im conservative and evangelical, but im semi immortal. I got delusions of immortality."

Sometimes I feel like science has accomplished so much, but aren't we missing the point sometimes with it? Science cannot provide happiness, cannot provide love, along with a lot of base emotions that we need. I don't know how I got on that scientific thread of thought, but I did.

Set an alarm for 1-2 hours and until the alarm rings I forbid myself to think about heavy stuff and do a self care instead. My self care list: Exercise is too much for me at the moment so I just take a short walk around the neighborhood. Paint something simple that doesn’t require me to sit for hours trying to get it right. Massaging myself with a massage oil. Then take a shower and wash my hair. Put on lotion and wear a comfortable clothes after that. Play a simple game on my phone. Watch funny animal videos or fun music concerts. Play with my cats. Order my favorite food (I just bought a cake today) Decorate my room with flowers and aromatherapy is on almost all the time And the last one I don’t recommend because it’s just me being weird, but I like doing chores. The smell of soap when doing dishes. Seeing my clothes are folded or hung up nice
ly in my closet. The feel of squeaky clean floor on my soles after I sweep and mop it. Etc. When I feel like I don’t have any control about things that happen in my life, I control my surroundings by doing all these chores.

I can talk back to the 2 voices, yes. I really believe its good & evil battling for my soul. The evil voice that tells me to go ahead & do a very dangerous, risky act involving myself, has literally almost killed me. I would get physically hurt & could've been killed. Many times, throughout my life. Its actually frightening & people are shocked at my reckless behavior. I'm used to it, cuz I've always been this way, from a young age. Teachers told my parents to get me help. My parents never did. They were both mentally ill & deep in their own addictions. Yes, I've always wondered if I had schizophrenia. I've read about the different symptoms. Some I do not have. Right, only a Dr would know, for sure. Thanks again for replying."

Has your husband been seeing anyone during this time? Things happen to couples sometimes. And they either work it out and move forward. Or they go their own ways. I suffer from depression and to an extent, anxiety too. But I don't think these had anything to do with what was going on with my relationship. Smile. It will be ok."

174326167,"had some insight the other day that I was time traveled and cloned back in time to prevent a paradox and thus remain in the same damn timeline. I also think there’s a possible paradox or dilemma preventing me from going back in time and undoing things like maybe I had a kid, but there’s no memory, proof, and I think it’s a delusion. Seems like I’m stuck around 2010-2011 reincarnation wise and that it involves my free will, soul, and fate. I don’t know. It’s probably not real: the kid part. If I had kids, it would have been a past life/parallel universe/different dimension thing and potentially/possibly against my will. Aliens could have been involved to control the flow of time.Just my random thoughts here. The more I’m around the more I remember and understand like being abducted in college by aliens and being a victim of consciousness transfer into a new clone in a satanic-like ritual or transhumanism ????????. I read _NAME_ and the SSP so it could be both or just Monarch/MK-Ultra p
rogramming. I also think of Montauk and other things too but I don’t know. Just searching and looking and sometimes it brings up unbrearable pain and suffering and more confusion and more problems. Some of it’s not real, while other stuff I question. I keep looking and I keep suffering more sometimes. I still don’t know why I was targeted by grey aliens and reptilians and more. I remember people being there too which points to an Illuminati ritual that resulted in many problems for me not excluding schizophrenia."
174326172,"How long did it take before this happened? I know what you mean. I mean, technically, you could rent a small studio apartment and just live it up. I would hate being in bed all the time. I think that they really need to try to give you an anti depressant to see how that would work. Wellbutrin didn’t help me either, so don’t be discouraged. Also, if you want to lose weight, drinking apple cider vinegar worked for me. It actually worked too well. I was taking it for something else, but ended up losing like 15 pounds a month, despite eating junk food everyday for a while(was in a hotel)"

175887298,"Choiceless: Yes, they insert thoughts to you, a lot. And alot of time they talk about completely random stuff to make you think theyre not hearing your thoughts, yes. But its not all lies. Many times they say things that reasonates with me alot. So you can tell their being honest those times. I live in a home for people with ""mental illness"". So im surrounded by staff and people living here all day. Theyre being cool with me but ofc they hide the fact that they can read my mind. But 1 or 2 of the people living here have told me: -""You ""think"" out loud"". For some reason our thoughts are being projected stronger than most people. Actually i dont think there being projected anymore. I think they ""pop"" up instantly into their minds. As in quantum entaglement. check it up. _PERSON_ said: ""spooky action at a distance"". So if you were to be on the north pole and a ""mind reader"" on the south pole he would of picked up your thought immediately! Hell, even if the mind reader were to be on mars, s
till immediately. Im almost 100% sure of this. Our brains are wired up. We are all connected. We all have the ability to read minds or the ability to ""open up"" all of the other ""claires"". You just have to stimulate the ""reptlian"" part of the brain. Like you and i(and many other people in here) did the day we got ""psychosis"" - unknowingly. All of us in here reading this can do it. BUT! i dont want to, they will just f*ck with your head 24/7, like they do to other ""schizophrenics"" whove managed to STILL here ""voices"". The only thing im really unsure of is why? or how? are we ""stronger broadcasters"". Do we have more neuro activity? More neurons/synapsis? i dont know but i think so. I think we are more ""talented"" than most. We use a greater capacity of the brain. _PERSON_, recieved your pm but cant pm you?"

175887304,I turn 50 this summer and had my annual physical in January. They wanted to do a colonoscopy and I said no thank you so they gave me a kit to mail in some samples. I wasn’t going to do that either. It’s kind of gross so I won’t discuss it but I mailed them in. This is at the VA. Well TriWest calls me today on behalf of the VA to schedule me with an outside doctor. A gastro something. I didn’t quite catch what it was. I asked her what this was for and they just said it’s due to the results of my test. They said they would call back with appointment confirmation next week. I hope I don’t have colon cancer or something like that. I am probably going to end up with a hose up my rear after all. Right before my grandmother died she told me not to get old. She died at 93. Maybe it’s nothing. I had planned on moving soon. We will see when this appointment is.

175887321,"If they're toxic and hurtful, they probably aren't the friends you necessarily want anyway. It can be tough to face the idea of not having a built-in social network when you're young, but perhaps if you slowly try to expand your circle of who you talk to, more friends (and likely better ones by the sound of it) will come naturally. Stay nice and just be yourself. If you reach out a little more, good things will eventually happen for you. It doesn't sound like you need therapy at all to me. Your fear is perfectly natural and that's ok. Nobody said you have to have just one group or swap out all your relationships for all new ones. I think that you might just keep what you have a little while unless you just become so uncomfortable that you no longer want to deal with their BS. Mean types usually are more fearful of having nobody that accepts them so they act in ways that are often not so nice. But people can change and evolve. The pandemic makes it tough but you gotta just be tougher than your fear

175887324,"So when the brain is more active, it decreases connectivity in the brain. When you do nothing, you're more creative and have more ""Aha"" moments. A lot of scientists found discoveries while bedridden or while doing nothing. When the brain is under an MRI scan, it is more active than when being shown a movie or something. That's why I now believe that antipsychotics prevent lowered IQ from psychosis because psychosis makes the brain more active about nonsense things and being busy with stress. Stress kills. I think stress is the biggest cause of illness. A neuron doesn't know that it's apart of the brain like how an ant doesn't know it's apart of a colony or a person doesn't know everything about society or an economy. That's why I was talking about those ""Scientific discoveries"" I had while hiking, looking at nature and being inside my own head. That's why meditation is so important. I used to sleep so long and do nothing when I was a teenager due to antipsychotics. Maybe that was a good thing f
or me and my psychosis."

This question was posed to _NAME_ by some rabbinical students in reference to the Sabbath. Anyway, this is all by and by, what I want to talk about is Lemons and vitamin C, There is a wealth of contradictory evidence about mega doses of vitamins following a suggestion of _PERSON_ that mega doses of vitamin C could cure anything, In order to resolve the contradiction, it has been proposed that synthetic vitamins have different energy profiles to natural ones, This is based on experimentation with water and the theory also has its proponents amongst TCM practitioners as a way of explaining why herbal medicines work despite having no active chemical ingredients as far as chemistry is concerned. In my experience, natural tobacco is much better for t
he mind than vaping. They do not list the ingredients on tobacco. It is possible that the leaves do not even contain nicotine. The nicotine in vaping is synthetic, as is the honey oil base which is very sweet. I using both at the moment, and am still undecided as to whether I can survive without them. So, is electricity fire? And what is the point of mixing metal with wood? Thank you."

The part in Levitacus that is routinely translated as homosexuality, actually translates from the original Hebrew very poorly, but possibly into “pedophilia.” The literal translation was likely condemning grown, adult men who were having sex with little boys. Another possible translation is that it prohibits men who are ALREADY MARRIED to women from engaging in sexual activity with other men or women. It had nothing against grown adult men or women committing themselves to each other. In addition to that, the _PERSON_ (in the Catholic religion he is seen as the direct messenger for God) recently made a public statement supporting homosexuality, because it creates more p
arents for needy children around the world. If you have no desire to act on homosexual thoughts, or choose not to for personal reasons, that is your own choice. But nothing in the genuine Christian faith prohibits you from doing so. I don’t discuss faith much, because it is against the rules, but I think it is important for you to know this."
175887330,"You know if you zoom out you could argue that Planet Earth is one big organism and we’re just little cells that handle the microscopic stuff. The weird thing there however is that Planet Earth doesn’t have a consciousness, whereas we do. I think consciousness is very separate. As in, I don’t think the world is one consciousness at all. People are just more connected because of the internet. For the world to have a shared consciousness that would have to be reflected in something sentient… like if the internet gained sentience all of the sudden, then you could argue that a worldly consciousness existed. Really we’re just a bunch of separate conscious people I think."

I'm afraid to read right now though cuz of possible psychedelic flashback or psychosis so I listened to music and daydreamed in the jeep all the way back to town. I plan on making a note where I write down genius thoughts. I believe that everyone can have genius thoughts if they want to have them =] I find everything really interesting. That's my problem. Yet I don't read much! I need to discipline myself.. But then I won't think much.. Idk.. Or I'll think too much.. I was arguing with atheists and theists again. I don't think I'm psychotic but it feels a little borderline. But things will be good. I miss my dad. I feel alone.

175887410,"While I certainly can't prove it I would suspect most of us, here on PC, were struggling with our various mental illnesses well before we actually received anything in the way of a diagnosis. It's unclear to me, from what you wrote, whether or not you're currently in treatment. If not, perhaps now is the time to get started? And if you are currently in treatment, perhaps talking with the mental health professionals in your life about career options would be the appropriate way to approach the subject? I certainly don't think I would be in a position to advise you."
175887411,"I started thinking everything people said and did was an extension of their sub conscious. Everything is a symbol that is connected to another symbol kinda game. I still think this but you might make yourself go crazy, especially when you anaylze things like your poetry and writing. Of course my meds made it all go away and now its just kinda there, but at the same time not really. Not everything someone says has meaning, its just the schizophrenia/psychosis looking for connections that arent there. I actually watched a video of this guy that had some sort of system that the alphabet used, had magic spells within it depending on the word. It was an interesting video but i could tell he was in deep psychosis. Did you go hyper observant during the times you played this language game?"

175887413,"Something I have struggled with even before the illness came about, any of you have a confidence problem? Anyone overcame it with any good advice?"
175887414,"Yes, I often wonder why my illness affected me so badly. Plenty of people have bad childhoods and still are not crippled by mental disease. In my case, I guess it was just the luck of the draw. Studies show that people are able to overcome anything so long as they have at least one person who believes in and supports them. That one person can be oneself, too I suppose. As for biological abnormalities, I know it’s convention nowadays for the psychiatric industry to premise mental illness almost exclusively on chemical imbalances and such. But I believe both nature and nurture interact to make us what we are. There’s no doubt in my mind though that my shot of Invega is really helping me not to get lost or act on my delusions."

174326191,When I’m in a major depressive episode I sleep that much and more. You really need to get your anti-depressant squared away until you find one that’s working. I have to take Rexulti and a max dose of Cymbalta in order to not be depressed. Sometimes it takes a lot.

Also, impulsive spending or shopping are an indicator of the second subgroup. I detrained my impulsivity with the Focus Trainer android app. (No longer available on the Play Store but the Focus Trainer APK manual install file is still available online.) I’m also a bit of a scaredy cat when it comes to physical safety. This is one arena where being a bit of a coward is highly protective."

I told HR that i was struggling with depression and couldn’t work there anymore. They wished me luck and that was that."

174326192,"It is totally trendy to suffer from depression. People love to say it. But its a good thing imo because people use to roll their eyes when you said you were depressed. Even if trendy, i know lots of people who legit suffer from depression in a way thats similar to severe negative symptoms. The type of depression where the tv is on and you’re staring at a wall instead of watching and laughing along and you sleep as much as you can. Depression is brutal and i have a theory its only going to get more common as our brains are having more and more time to over think things the more civilized we get. Idk just my two cents."

175887470,"So it feels like my anxiety has gotten better over the last two years. This summer it’s been different tho. In the past, I’ve been able to get through an anxious moment fine within 5-10 mins. Maybe 20 at the most. I’m pretty sure I have anxiety about anxiety. I despise and fear the symptoms. I worry it’ll happen at the worst moment like in a meeting or at the dinner table. All that went away until this summer. Today I woke from a nap and had a severe rush of anxiety. The difference this time were my thoughts. It was hard to regain control. I felt a little out of breath and the dread felt terrible. Couldn’t help but think it would last forever until I lose it. I couldn’t concentrate on my calming music and it felt like the end of the world. It went away after 30 mins, but I’m baffled. This is the 2nd time I’ve had anxiety this summer where I feel like I’m not in control during the moment it’s happening and the negative thoughts run wild. Coming here for help and a refresher. Aski
ng for great strategies that work for you when your thoughts get overwhelming? My fast heart rate during these moments make it worse. So anything will help me, thank you!!"

175887480,I think I got psychological damage from this disease.
175887481,I’m thinking now that my fatigue has nothing to do with the psych meds. Maybe it’s the beta blocker or my obesity or my age? It’s so frustrating because I don’t know the cause. Last time I saw my family doctor he didn’t have answers either. All I know is that I’m so exhausted! Really can’t function like this.
175887482,I made a list of all the things I want to get done everyday and everyday I go down this list starting in the morning and I mentally check off each item on the list until I’m done by the end of my day. And the items include exercise.
175887483,"Many people suffer and don’t kill themselves. Many people feel hopeless but they keep going and often get better. When I was 19 and 20 I had nothing going for me. I was suicidal, in my warped mind I had every reason to kill myself. But I got better and I’m so happy I’m still alive. When I was 19 I was in my first group home. I was psychotic and delusional. I spent more than a year at that place suffering the whole time. I was in a small room and slept on a dirty mattress on the floor the whole time I was there. I saw no future, I had nothing and every day was a different form of torture. And everybody else there was in the same boat and a few of the people were a little dangerous. I spent the year there and then the following year I spent 8 months in a hospital, thrown in with a bunch of homeless people, wannabe hoods, people who had been incarcerated, etc. But I got out and moved into a nice group home. 9 months later I got a job and now I’M looking back on being employed almost steadily s
ince 1983. I’M 59 years old now and living pretty much independently. I just want to make the point that those first two and a half years after being diagnosed I didn’t stand out in anyway. I was just another mental patient. No one would have predicted I would ever get well. No one who knew e back then would have predicted I would ever accomplish anything. I was severely ill. But I a one of the reasons why people should not give up. You keep trying to predict the future. Well, you can’t. You might get better, lots of people do. You just got to keep going. The other people on this thread gave you good advice. If you’re suicidal than do what they say and call a hotline or maybe go to the hospital. But I just here to tell you that the reality is that people get better. Lots of people have been in yours and mine shoes.Life ain’t easy for any of us. But you have a chance to get better. In my 59 years I’ve seen that the majority of the people have potential. You just have to find it. I tapped mine with 
a lot of help, you just have to go through the times where doing anything seems impossible. And keep going. With help, hard work and luck you may get a little something out of life. I wish you good luck and take care of yourself. You have a chance and things may change for the better for you!"

175887485,"I remembered some things that happened to me. I was raped by my grandfather when I was six. While he was doing it he told me “God can’t save you. Jesus can’t save you.” When I was eight they took me to the desert where there was a boy around my age wearing a vest contraption. They gave me a button and told me if I pushed it he would die, but if I didn’t push it I would die. I pushed the button. The boy died and they forced me to drink blood from a cup. When I was about 19 I was closing at Subway. A man came up to the door and knocked. I opened the door and he pulled out a gun. He raped me at gun point. He told me “God can’t save you. Jesus can’t save you.” He said if I didn’t want to get hurt I would have to do as I was told. He told me to forget our conversation so I did. I always forgot him from then on. I got a job waitressing in a bar. The man who had raped me came in with a guy who claimed to be with the FBI. He told me that if anyone asked what we talked about to tell them 
that he told me to keep an eye out for men with shaved heads because terrorists like to shave their heads before an attack. The man who had raped me, who I couldn’t remember, came in again later. He gave me a packet of powder and told me to put it in a man’s drink. I did. The man died of an overdose. The man came in again, this time _NAME_ and the Zetas were in the bar. But this time when the man who raped me told me to leave with one of the men and sleep with him, I told the _PERSON_ about it instead. The Zetas left. I protected the man who raped me and the Zetas didn’t kill him. _NAME_ told me if I ever did something that stupid again he would kill me. He told me that the Zeta that the man wanted me to sleep with wanted to kill me, so I forgot him. Every time I saw the Zeta, I immediately forgot him. I did not remember the man who raped me or the _PERSON_ until I watched the movie Sicario, which triggered my memories. Remembering a bunch of traumatic events all of a sudden put me into my first psychot
ic episode. And everyone will say these are false memories, but these are my memories."

I often drop stuff multiple times in a row and I frequently bump into walls. Some times my arm will go flying out as if it has a mind of its own. Very annoying. I used to be embarrassed but not really now."
175887502,"I don’t know what to do, I just got served three write ups at work today all from my boss, who owns the companies. Not from my direct office manager. One of them was detailing all the days I’ve missed since August(which he included my approved leave of absence which I don’t think is fair) they say I’ve missed 15 work days, if you don’t include my leave that brings it down to 7 days missed. The next one was for a panic attack I had at work they detailed in it that I “started crying and refused to see a patient” when in all reality I had a full blown panic attack it had nothing to do with the patient. And the final one I get that I deserve but it was for falling asleep during our staff meeting because I had taken too much medication the night before. Okay I get that I deserve these but also it’s all directly related to my medication and my ??????? mental illness. I don’t want to lose another job due to my mental illness. I already lost my dream job back in July of 2018. I’ve manag
ed to hold down a couple jobs since then but every job I get I find I can barely preform even if it’s the lowest responsibility job like working in the food industry. My job I have now has the most responsibility out of any that I’ve had before. I’d hate to waste this opportunity. I don’t know what I’m going to do, I want to be a great hard worker who is reliable but I find with this stupid illness and all the medication that it’s even harder to do than I even imagined. Does anyone have any advice? I feel as though I should give up on my dreams of becoming a dental hygienist and settle for a mediocre job like housekeeping or something. I don’t know what else to do at this point."

175887511,It’s like delusions. It doesn’t take long for someone in the know to say that is delusional. Sure. It may take a while to figure out whether it’s internal or external but it’s still hallucinations. It doesn’t matter about the content…It can be about anything but it’s still delusional and simple to spot for those in the know!
175887512,"Don't worry it just feels like they can but the only way that anyone can even get a certain percent of it is if they read your body language - Which isn't much. Wait for the med to kick in and just sit alone. If anyone is in the house, tell them how you're feeling - be honest. It just helps to talk. I know you deal with DR/DP dissociation so it's hard to function and worse to deal with paranoia but don't worry it will be ok.. Eventually you'll look back on this - Maybe in the morning, a week from now or later and you'll feel content. You deserve to find peace and calmness. Try to distract yourself - Even with a hand held object that moves.. Just think through the thoughts - Try to analyze or ignore. We can never stop thinking but we can change how we think. We've all been through this or similar to what you're going through. The right meds help but it's a huge pain to go through the process. You can do it.."

175887536,"I went through a massive _PERSON_ kick in high school. I literally went down to the library, which was awful, and I asked ""why don't you have any _PERSON_?"" to the school librarian. She said back ""I've been working here for 26 years, and you're the first kid to ask for _PERSON_. That's why."" But no, she had a copy of _PERSON_, Macbeth and Hamlet in the back. She just gave them to me. Not as a rental from the library, but just told me to take them. English was always my best subject, but I was so awful at everything else that I barely graduated. I failed multiple math courses. I failed a course because I told the bimbo teaching it that she only got her job because her mother was the school superintendent (something I still stand by). I was in the ""stupid"" classes. They call them that, but the kids in those classes had a hell of a lot more common sense than any of the kids graduating in the top ten of the class. But I digress. We watched _PERSON_ films. We watched one of _NAME_ and _NAME_, actu
ally two. We watched an actual _NAME_ and _NAME_ production and the ""gangsta"" one, where the teacher edited out all the shooting and killing between the families. If you're going to show a film, show the whole thing. They didn't cut out the sword play in the other one, but _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ getting gunned down is too much apparently. Then a few years went by. We read some decent books, some trash books. Huckleberry Fin was a favorite of mine. The kids in the ""smart"" classes thought it was funny because the N-word was used in it. Kids in the ""stupid"" classes understood that's how that time period was I digress again, forgive me. Hamlet gets brought up. I told my English teacher my senior year that I read Hamlet two years prior. I watched the _NAME_ adaptation and thought it ruined everything, and not just Hamlet, but everything! We ended up watching the _NAME_ version (I probably butchered his name). Let me tell you something, it's set in a different time period, but it's not ""gangsta"" time period 
like _NAME_ and what's her face. They had bolt-lock rifles and horses, not assault rifles and cars. The thing that blew me away the most with it though was the score behind it. _NAME_ is an under-appreciated composer. Everyone talks about _NAME_ (yay!) and _NAME_ (boo!) all the time. _NAME_ is the modern day _PERSON_. _NAME_ is to classical music what McDonald's is to fine dining. _NAME_ wrote the most fitting score to any Shakespearean piece I've ever heard. The thing that always caught me, was after the dust settled, _PERSON_ been poisoned, Claudius is dead, the only major character from the entire play still standing is _NAME_. _PERSON_ knows that's it, he's dead. As soon as the cut back to the final exchange between _PERSON_ and _NAME_, after it shows _PERSON_ arriving, this - https://youtu.be/0Die8pLjY6M - begins to play. This is the perfect music for the scene, and out of any film I've ever seen, I think it's the most fitting.. It's calm, collective, and graceful. It fits the scene so well. I can't find 
that exact scene on Youtube. I can find the soliloquy from the fourth act, but I can't find anything from act five. _PERSON_ really sold the part too. Was he Sir _NAME_? No, but damn if he wasn't the next best thing. I'm rambling on, I'll stop."

175887568,People are asses but I still need to ask are you ok? Paranoia is a cruel master as you know and it’s not good to feel like this. Stress is often a thing that makes us come unstuck…you under more stress than usual? Not good thinking everyone against you.

175887572,Ok I hear my daughters youtube talking about me. And when I go out in stores people are talking about me. I literally hear it. So its hard to tell if it’s a delusion. I don’t feel safe and I feel like I’m famous. Its like everyone is watching me and I’m famous.

I just feel like there’s more people like me but I’m the only one with the balls to mention anything about it…"
175887576,I had a remission in 2007 and stayed five years off meds. I thought it would be forever off meds but my sza came back in 2012 and been on meds ever since. I don’t know if I can come off them again.

My vocational rehabilitation counselor and my mental health team told me I would never be able to do either one. It wasn’t and isn’t easy but I don’t want to give up.

We used to have to hunt and kill for food on a regular basis, like everyday. Help from a doc and with medication you may improve but I also think any thoughts of that maybe its an instinctual need maybe you should try being a farmer or butcher for a spell, feel it out. I run a small backyard farm I don’t want to say I envision hurting anyone but when I do get that rage I can go butcher a turkey and not only have meat in my freezer but I have an outlit. If thats a good thing or not Idk I’m not a professional"

175887589,The rest of her ain’t too shabby either.
175887590,I think the problem was I didn't add the ingredients in the order that they were supposed to go in and I didn't add enough water. That's the only thing I can think off. I'll give it back to my sister this week and maybe sometime I can go over to her house and she can make bread so I can see what I might have done wrong.

174326229,"I’ve stopped watching TV shows and trailers for the most part. I know I got issues, that’s what I’m addressing. I appreciate your feedback. I’ve actually been feeling better and calmer. I still struggle with the energy drinks. Sometimes, I just don’t care, you know? The “research” I do is for myself. To figure out stuff and to remember. Some stuff did happen. I just cannot remember all of it and piece it all together. The mind blocks off things too painful to remember. I’ve been chronically dissociated 24/7 every day for 7+ years. It was worse than hell and worse than the so-called schizophrenia. I have been to traditional therapy (DBT, CBT) on and off for years at a few different places. I don’t live in an up scale neighborhood like _NAME_ Hills or by the beach or by a university or by whatever – it wouldn’t much matter anyways. The point is, I tried, and it failed largely because of the patients going there. I figured out due to Medi-Cal changes they let everyone and everybo
dy in. Criminals. I also got triggered when people (military types) started wearing their Camo (fatigues) during group and starting joining therapy, which is fine, but it triggered memories of _PERSON_ (me being taken and kidnapped from the hospital by the military – possibly by the patients too). It triggered past life memories of being taken to DUMBs and being experimented on and possibly seeing aliens at various military bases. Some of the patients were cool, kind, and nice people. Some had PTSD. I’m not judging, but because of what I’ve been through and the UFOs, aliens, experimental planes, and black helicopters over my house, and my computer acting funny, I connected it all and decided to use my free will and not go back to that place. Vraylar keeps me stable and except that 1 time I got 5150’d, the + 2 dozen times I’ve been inpatient and outpatient over the years, was all voluntary. I’m not looking for affirmation or a sounding board, but more like hoping somebody might relate or catch on o
n this forum or internet and maybe just maybe just get my story out and vent. The odds are definitely a billion to one against me. They are not in my favor. The energy drinks don’t help at all. But I wouldn’t beat some one up (personally) if they had a drinking problem if they were abused or tortured and stuff in war or somewhere else or been through some abusive ???? growing up. The problem is there are tons of people like me on the internet. We tend to gravitate towards each other. I’m the only one too chicken to talk to them. I only visit this forum, had my occasional blog posts (now gone), and did shitty YouTube videos. I’ve been to _NAME_, Area 51, and Montauk Base in my past lives. I’ve been cloned. I’ve bit off more than I could chew at college. Not sure why. I hope people know I feel uncomfortable talking about such things and don’t like to. I get scared and hate it. Not that it matters, but I have this delusion that someone stole my DNA to have my kids. It’s really scary and embarrass
ing and I don’t know if it’s real or true. I don’t want to know. I don’t even know who it is. It’s part of the trauma I experience and wake up every day from. I keep reliving the same day and life over and over again for eternity. Something supernatural is about me. I believe we live in a computer program/simulation and I’ve escaped and helped run it. This stuff is really, really far out there and nobody else has really come up with this idea except me. I feel like I was the first."
175887599,I was at a ”ward school” in the psych ward I prefer being able to study alone
175887600,"_PERSON_ said... Suffering Husband, it sounds like it's time for a new doctor. Is this doctor a psychiatrist? Yes, he is a psychiatrist and getting her just to see him was a several month task. Trying to get her to go to a new doctor will be even more difficult."

175887609,"No, and we live almost 2 hours from the nearest psych hospital. I feel that I should go, but who will drive me there? My parents are working, they will return home exhausted. There’s no solution now. I drive, but now I just cant"

175887613,"I go to bed at 9amish, wake up every hour, finally am “up” for night between 5 and 8pm We gave up on the last available sleeping med for me to try, as it did not a thing to make me tired or to keep me asleep. Now I did start this fentanyl patch for pain alongside my tramadol, and it’s slowly helping I’m on day 4 of a 30 day trial. And while I am still waking up because of pain, nightmares. Etc. It is better sleep. Does that make sense? But my migraines are oy vey as _PERSON_ would say. So instead of usually a total of 3-6 RX needing migraine days, I’m on my 3rd 3 day refill, but the nurse is just filling it, doc isn’t needing to sign anything since it’s imatrex. But pain doc said to take OTC migraine excedrin with it too. But even with needing to be in a dark room all the time, eyes watering and I can’t have my glasses on unless stumbling to the bathroom or trying to help with homework, it’s better.

175887619,"I've had problems with thinking that doing certain things was a way of signalling my unconscious consent to the universe to have bad things happen to me.

(given around here two hundred would cover everything)"
174326232,I went through a time of bad negative symptoms for a while a few years ago. I think it was because my Seroquel dose was too high. Once I got off of Seroquel my life improved and I was able to enjoy life again.
175887624,I forgive cos i forget
175887625,Meds did make me better in the past so I am staying with what worked for me.
175887626,"I kind of understand but that kind of thinking is also bad, the thing is to have support you have to open up and you have to talk to people. Everyone wants someone to be there for you and sometimes you think to yourself why isnt anyone supporting me but you also have to look at your own behavior. If you arent giving everyone the time of day than why would they give it to you. Its hard to open up to people but you have to if you want to have a relationship with anyone and you have to be willing to listening to them. Accept their problems and spill your own and maybe build something."

175887632,"Hey all. I’ll preface this by saying I’m not suicidal or otherwise in danger of harming myself. It’s more like I just want to give up on improving my life. I’m taking online classes and am getting more and more behind in them. I don’t have a computer of my own at the moment (money issues) so I’m having to use others’ laptops to complete assignments but I’m not always guaranteed access to those laptops when I need it. There’s also the factor of my general apathy to consider; my classes aren’t that difficult and logically I know getting good grades in them will set me up for a better future than I could have hoped for before I decided to give school another try… but apathy persists nonetheless. It’s been an obstacle for me my whole life, and I suspect the constant degradation of my entire being from those around me starting from my childhood has played a starring role in its formation. I’m not giving up on my classes just yet, but it’s getting harder to care about them by 
the day. I suspect I might have entered a depressive spell within the past month or so. I’m in therapy and taking my meds as prescribed. It’s not possible for me to see someone about a med change at the moment because my insurance policy is inactive and I’m having issues getting it renewed. I’m paying for therapy straight from my own bank account. I’m really trying to take in my therapist’s suggestions but I can’t shake the feeling that nothing will get through to my brain to prompt real change. Thanks for reading. I will say I feel a bit better having vented here because I know you guys can truly empathize."
175887633,"Man my sister can’t catch a break, she’s picked up some sort of flu again, she had stomach flu before her colonoscopy which made it a nightmare but now she’s achy with fever again. We think she picked up something on the plane. She’s supposed to return home on Sunday but I don’t want her near my mom because if she gets sick before surgery they’ll either cancel the surgery if they know or worse it could be really bad if my mom got sick after the surgery. I told my sister I could pay for a hotel for her....she doesn’t want to though."

175887644,Yeah I get the leg thing too. I have been on it once before about the same dose as you and I had to come off it and I haven’t been on anything since and wasn’t coping. I don’t know why they tried me on it again.
175887645,Me too. I tried lowering my amisulpride dose and got psychosis episode four days later.
175887646,It’s common to be on a couple of meds. I take an antipsychotic and an anti depressant. Depression and anxiety are common to those with sz and related disorders.

175887659,I don’t really like sleep. If I didn’t have to I probably wouldn’t sleep. I used to be able to sleep between 2-4 hours a night (probably hypomanic though). I’ve come to value it now but I still don’t really like sleep.
174326248,Regular abilify is like drinking water to me
175887660,"Sorry, but being affected by psychosis usually means one cannot tell what’s real and what’s not. You should see a dr. I can assure you, god doesn’t communicate through voices. otherwise it’d be proof he exists and there’s no question about people having religion or not having religion beliefs - what I’m saying. is, it is very very very likely you’re psychotic and need a dr’s assistance."
174326246,I’m stuck in a rut too. But I’m afraid to add to or change my meds. While I may be in a rut my med regime (Abilify 15mg) has kept me out of hospital. I’m not sure I want to mess with success. Abilify is supposed to have some sort of antidepressant effect anyway. I don’t actually feel depressed it’s just that my motivation is zero.

I spoke with the psychiatrist today, and he says that he is happy to try and reduce the level of AP I am taking, as I have been clear of psychosis for nearly two years now. Although we didn’t agree with the level that I dropped my dose, he just said now you have done it, wait 4-6 weeks before considering whether it needs raising or I can make a further reduction We _NAME_ a line under everything that was upsetting me, and we’re going to plan what next rather than focusing on the irritating things that have transpired over the last few months. Basically all is good with my doctor and case worker, and I am feeling a bit more positive about things. The problem was he didn’t want to cut down so many meds like benzos etc at the same time, but we’re past that point now and he thinks we should follow the status quo and see what happens.

175887705,One of the big complaints of the patients at the state psych hospital I went to was that they were physically sedated too much.

I hope you guys find rest and something that works for you. If you have a racing mind, I would practice trying to slow down. I don’t know if its possible, some of you guys really get worked up. I think though that its at least something to work on to try and see if it bears any fruit for yal. I literally think “in” with an intake of breath and “out” with the exhale, and if I’m having any trouble getting to rest, I first get as comfy as I can trying out the positions I like, and then I give this a go, and I’m out shortly after.

Its impossible for me to initiate a social interaction with a stranger, I cant even begin to imagine what to say, or worse I can imagine everything but cant seem to find a valid reason as to why I should say anything at all, unfortunately that's literally the only way to meet people, so I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna die sad and alone. Pretty depressing. So that's why I would live to find a meeting place for others like me, because the most important part of t
hat special someone I'm trying to meet (well not actively trying, just wishing) is that they are understanding, they know what I am, understand it and are ok and patient with it/me. I realize I'm pretty much talking about an oxymoron, cause none with stp would show up, if your like me you'll really want to go then intentionally procrastinate or just freeze up until it's too late, then I'll say ""well it's too late, cant go now"" and all the stress and worry that had me frozen and unable to leave the house will disappear, then I'll just hate myself for ""wussing out"". It may be easier to go to a meeting with similar people, cause I'd know i wouldn't have to worry about being social or feeling like an alien among ""regular"" people, I might feel, idk, something different than my usual undesirable feelings. I do gotta say, just reading other posts from similar people made me feel less like an alien and that's a good thing, so thank you for sharing, hopefully 1 person might read my post and feel a little less al
one. All that being said, if anyone has information about how people with stp are supposed to find a life partner, I would really appreciate that, I dont even know where I would begin to look for that, both in real life or the internet, thanks for letting me vent, it feels much less crazy to type to real people than to just sit alone imagining myself having elaborate conversations with all the people in my life that I actually never speak to in real life"

174326273,I’ve been living with schizophrenia for 22 years. I haven’t heard voices in over 10 years. I hate being on disability. I spent 8 years in the workforce trying to make it. I get $900 a month and I don’t know how I’m going to survive on it. I was making $800 a week when I was working. My mom has lung cancer and my grandmother has Alzheimers. They’re all I have. At this point everyone in the family is out for themselves. My mom has no will and is in total denial about everything. If something happens to my grandmother I get her car which is at the end of it’s life span. With my moms problems I went tot he doctor and they found 3 growths in my lungs. The doctor said they’re to small to be cancer. I was suppose to go see a specialist back in April but I haven’t done it. At this point I really don’t care. After everything I’ve dealt with in my life I can’t wait until it’s over. At some points I smoke 4 packs a day. My anxiety level is so high I get no relief. I was thinking about g
oing and getting a fifth of liquor to try and calm my nerves. I’m taking Valium twice a day and it works for about 2 hours then I’m back to being a nervous wreck. I’m hoping to drop dead. I don’t want to deal with my life or this illness any longer. I haven’t had hallucinations in years but I get no enjoyment out of anything. I can’t take antidepressants I’ve tried several over the years. Paxil Prozac Zoloft Lexapro they all make me a fruitloop. My mind is torturing me and I see no way out. I don’t plan on harming myself but I’m not doing myself any favors either. I just want to drop dead as soon as possible.

175887842,"I wish it were 1962 and everything fun* was only just starting. But you could be a smoker inside and people rarely if ever complained. *Fun according to my life span only. But the drugs were a terrible idea for people like me. I did smoke pot everyday for three years, but it was the acid and similar that was really bad for me. Really wish I'd never used it. The pot must have had a powerful effect on me too. I was too young to be taking all that stuff. Cigarettes seem tame in comparison. I regret a lot. I put the scattered in scatterbrained. Pretty sure that was from the pot. Increased and acute anxiety were the lasting effects of acid. My favorite drug was the valium someone gave me when I was having a bad trip. And cigarettes. Always the cigarettes. I don't have much life left I guess. I always had suicidal ideation. Anyway I've lost my grip on life. I no longer think of time or the future in the same way. It's all just a night to get through, not anything that I can meaningfully do anymore. It's 
a terrible waste. I wonder if the damage to my brain/mind was from the pot. It's hard to regret the pot because it did get me through 3 years. But it probably is a major cause of my current dementia."

175887850,"Sorry i didnt reply promptly, idk if i can help, im a noob at this life thing. But i think something that is sort of a cliche but is a very good option to atleast try out is to ‘live in the moment’. I suck at this. But im trying to leave the nest of family and nurses. They make me feel like i have no life of my own. In july i drove literally across the country in a little over 3 days. I drank like 20 red bulls and slept maybe 3 hours a day. Its not a smart thing to do, but i did feel like an adult for the first time and was legit making friends for the first time in years. I got sick and had to fly back to my family as i had a hard time getting my meds in the new province. I plan to do this again but to prepare more. Idk thats an extreme example, but i think developing independence (if that applies to you, idk) and being sort of a ‘yes man’ can really change your life. Parting words, life is exciting if you make it so. The old adage of “you get out of it what you put into it” and “you
th is wasted on the young” is so so very true. Idk thats all i got, apologies if it didnt help any. I hope you find fulfillment."

A popular supplement in this category is lione’s mane mushroom. Those who taking it notice a reduction in positive symptoms. Other acetylcholine enhancers also give similar effect like cdp choline, phosphatidylserine, high dose omega 3, holy basil tea (tulsi) etc. The downside is if you already have negative symptoms then acetycholine can worsen it and also depression. Lione’s mane, cdp choline etc strong choline enhancers while tulsi, phosphatidylserine weak enhancers thus weak ones not worsen negative symptoms like strong ones."

It was committed by a “normal” person with a job as a denturist. He killed 19 people. I would say a “normal” person without mental illness is equally capable of acts of extreme violence. The fact you and the other people with schizophrenia never talk about it, perpetuates the _USER_ID_ and discrimination. _USER_ID_ will never go away if you never speak up."

I wonder if the Zyprexa gives them more to me, but maybe its not probable… I still find I cant think well… I am not sure if aps help intellectual deficiency or yes? My pdoc was saying, that I cant think, cause I have mostly paranoid thoughts… maybe its true. But also, there are real ‘‘holes’’ in my thinking still… I lack ideas too I find… How are you pals?

During my relapse in 1989 I started going to a day treatment program. I was about 28 and it sounds like a kids program but there were about 5 or 6 of us and one or two counselors and we played charades or baked cookies or played ping pong, shot baskets out back on a court, played volleyball, had groups and lunch and breaks, did art projects etc. It didn’t cure me or turn my life around but it sure would have been a lot worse if I just sat home all day with nothing to do."

175887888,"In 1981 I spent 8 months in the hospital. Time fly’s when you’re having fun. It got boring as hell and I got tired of playing polo because the saddle on my horse gave me blisters. The hot tub was cool but all those naked bodies made me nervous and the waitresses bringing me my whiskey sours were kind of snobs. The candlelight dinners were a nice touch, as were the twice a day full body massages except the women masseuses had thick accents and kept asking me if I wanted a “sappy fending” but I never figured out what that meant.

175887896,"Is there a way of rephrasing that so it's not so unkind to yourself? I sometimes feel like a failure, too. I understand where you're coming from. One time I read a book on optimism. It said that if we make explanations to ourselves that we are always a failure or whatever, something like that, then we'll be more pessimistic. Not trying to imply that you're a pessimist. Generally, I feel like you're optimistic. So maybe just a bad day or night? Also there's a point in that book on optimism (and I don't personally know if I agree with this) that says you should explain things that are positive by saying that they are permanently that way (I hope this stuff makes at least a grain of sense). It's all very good in theory. I would say naturally I am a bit of a pessimist, but that's probably because I'm somewhat rationally-minded. I don't know. Hopefully some of what I said helped."

Maybe I would have done it anyways… I suffered so much it’s crazy. Years of mental anguish and suffering. 10 years of crap and loneliness and pain. I found out and believed we lived in a computer simulation. Technically, in this universe, Dr. _PERSON_ came up with the idea, but I’m not always too sure. I get downloads of information and ???? so if I’m worth anything more than a pile of ????, let me know. I think schizophrenia is caused by the norovirus and the vaccine can help.

175887915,"Hey, I'm sorry you feel so alone. I'm in my twenties and have an awful relationship with my mom. She had two kids with a guy I refer to as ""piece of poop"". It was really difficult for me to accept their relationship because I hated who my mom became dating him. I missed her beyond belief. She recently moved away from him and although now I feel like we could maybe have a relationship its painful because so much has happened in our lives. I highly doubt your kids don't care and I know they love you. Keep being strong. You'll get through this."

175887918,That’s really cool. Thanks for the info.
174326314,"Sure, i know it doesnt work for everybody and not everyone believes in it. Same goes for meds. In this case meds dont work, so next to f.e. trying clozapine, i think another thing to do, is: not give up. There are other things to at least give a try, that might offer alleviation. And for which there is at least some scientific proof. I would never claim they work surely, perfectly and for everybody though. I hated meds and managed to get off them, while doctors said that was not possible. I have spoken to several people who have healed from sz and are now medfree and functioning normally. So i always think it is worth a try. To not just give up on life when there is no response to meds."
175887919,better safe than sorry…glad you went…I went through that with my cardiologist too…
174326313,"I had that feeling at the beginning and went to court vs my psychiatrist. He said refusing treatment and meds is part of schizophrenia. From my experience, I am not functional in society with or without meds but without meds I am also suicidal. Without meds I am not functional bcz of positive symptoms and suicidal thoughts. With meds I am not functional bcz of negative symptoms. Its better to take meds bcz I am not suicidal on Risperdal 4mg."

175887922,Indeed _AT_MENTION_! It is a battle we all face isn’t it. Hope you’re doing okay.

175887929,"There’s two girls living together as roommates. One of them has a speech impediment and is so shy about it that she almost never goes out. Her roommate decides to try to help her by fixing her up on a blind date. The guy comes over Saturday night and picks up the girl and takes her to the county fair. They’re strolling along, passing the game booths and the food booths and the guy turns to the girl and says, “What do you want to do?” She replies, “I want to get weighed.” So he takes her to the booth where if they can’t guess your weight, then you win a prize. She steps on the scale and the carny guesses wrong so she wins a stuffed animal. They walk away and 5 minutes later the guy turns to the girl and says, “What do you want to do now?” She says, “I want to get weighed”. He thinks, "" That’s pretty weird"", but he takes her back, the fair worker can’t guess her weight she wins another stuffed animal. They walk off and he asks her again but by this time he’s fed up with 
how the dates going and he tells himself, "" If she says that one more time, that’s it. This date is over"". He asks her one more time what she wants to do. She says, "" I want to get weighed"". He loses it. He blows up in anger, grabs her by the hand drags her to the booth; another stuffed animal. He grabs her hand, pulls her angrily to the car and drives her home while silently fuming. The girl gets inside and her roommate says, "" How did the date go"" The girl replies, “Wousy.”"
175887930,"I feel like something like that would help. Just some achievable aim that is daily. I’ve never been into sport at all and whenever people ask me if I’d like to do running or play football (soccer) I’m always just like “no sports are ??????? lame”… Thanks for the advice _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Yeah I think I’ll have to try that. I love chocolate, but not the cheap stuff. I tend to have a bar a week or so (usually less). I try and make it last. But I do eat cookies most days, can cut that out. _AT_MENTION_ I used to smoke a lot, like a stupid amount 50 a day or something. I will never go back to it. It started messing my breathing up and I’m very happy as an ex-smoker."
174326307,"I feel so strongly that my teddy bears are actually alive. I’ve been talking to them and I hear them cry in my head. Besides that I’ve been hearing some voices. Like last night it was that of my brother even though he’s away at college, I heard him say something in my room. I wasn’t asleep. Visual hallucinations are not as active but the delusional thinking is. Any idea as to what I should do? I’ve been so anxious about school too."

I have some Ativan for the trip, that will help a lot."
175887935,"Think of it this way. People with actual heart conditions, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, are more likely to die from heart attacks.

I’m a great believer in protein, but after a while I was just eating the canned fruit and chocolate bars. I didn’t feel bad doing that. It seemed like the protein filled main courses were harder for my stomach to digest. It seemed like the energy needed to digest the meaty courses tired me out.

What I care about is how this is going to harm your relationships with people, because people are going to be an important support system for you. We’re not an illusion. I need the help of my family to get by, and the government to keep me from getting sick. I think its important to attach value to the humanity behind these structures. If you don’t then you’re going to have a sense of entitlement that is unwarranted. We’re all just people, bad things happen to everyone, this is a bad thing thats happening to us, but we have help and we can move past it in certain aspects with help."

175887957,That seems like a weird thing for her to approve. It takes at least 2 weeks for depakote to start having a therapeutic effect thus taking an extra dose once would probably just give you side effects if anything and not do anything beneficial. A good immediate acting med for agitation is something like a benzo. Hmm. Anyways sorry to hear you are feeling out of sorts.
175887958,my condolence
175887959,i spelled it wrong i didnt realize that.
175887960,"Hi Smokes, this is very much a delusion. I’m glad you don’t want to hurt yourself and have chosen not to. Please chat with your pdoc about this soon. It is important they know that you’re currently struggling with this."

175887963,I think this is the reference: the Guardian – 10 Sep 01 Lost genius of chess returns - or is it just a case of fool's mate? Reclusive American chess genius _NAME_ may have made an eccentric return by anonymously taking on some of today's best players on the internet. There may have been a more recent one but I’ll look later.
175887964,"Not really. My issues are more spiritual than physical. Meds aren’t the answer for me. I’m currently getting a shot of invega, but that’s mainly because I’m pressured into it due to circumstances."

174326321,"“when u go to see a psychiatrist first time with no very huge misbehaviour and nothing disturb your brain , when your brain is still normal, the doc cannot see what really is and said “oh you got depression, u have to take the antidepressants!” and when u take the antidepressants then u go mania , the pdoc will say :” oh sorry u are bipolar “ then when u decided not to take these meds, ur brain goes wrong because the meds become essence to you now! with nth wrong on your brain at first and now ur brain wrecks because the meds are the ones create the so-called “ chemica imbalance” . and then once u withdraw from the meds , you become so paranoid and ur cognitive ability goes near zero, congrats! you finally got diagnosed as schizophrenia right now! and u become a schizophrenic! and the pdoc will say: ? oh your diagnosis is actually schizophrenia? ,but why am i not a scizho before i come to meet u?” that’s what i write about, what’s wrong with it? i have been reported few times fo
r saying that “schizophrenia is latent homosexuality” which. told by _PERSON_ and i got banned for that, saying that i am discriminating homosexuality which i did not. I just wondered this could be true. and this time i expressed my own view of psychiatry and i got flagged. i dun understand what’s wrong with the content. is it that everyone must have to share the same view, “oh psychiatry is good , it is perfect. the assumption of chemica imbalance must be correct” ? why can’t i have my own view? it is all my experience! what’s wrong with that? anyway , i am fed up with the so-called “expression censorship”, i am done with this community."
175887966,Thanks for your reply! I see
175887967,Yeah good investment. I wasn’t depressed but totally unmotivated for years and years. These days I’m jogging everyday and doing weights and other exercise. I’m soon to be 49 and fitter than anytime in my thirties or late 20’s even. You’ve nothing to lose and much to gain. My suggestion. Get into a routine with everything. Take your meds same time everyday. Eat same time everyday. The more routine the better. Hope it works out well for you!
175887968,"They’re watching me with cameras. Maybe i influence them too, but why is this important?"
174326327,"Yes, I moved from my apartment because I was being tormented by urges/visions to jump from my balcony/stairs. I now live in a camper (no balcony or stairs). I also hadn’t done my dishes/cleaned my apartment in a year+, so I threw them all away (if no dishes, no dirty dishes either), I had all my things piled up in my apartment and now all my things are in storage. (Can’t be a mess if there’s nothing to make a mess with). Everything is a little easier to manage, I still have a lot of negative symptoms but my brain is much calmer/quiet in my camper.

175887969,I find everything weird.
175887970,I’ve never really been into chess. I’m mediocre at best. I actually like Chinese checkers or regular checkers. The problem with checkers is it always ends up in a stalemate.

I would advise seeking a psychiatrist or as we call them a pdoc. Then a therapist. A pdoc will put you on meds to combat those hallucinations. It’s scary but can be dealt with through help.

175887979,Idk if its the meds making me dumb.
175887980,Yes apart from being bitten by a dog today.
175887981,"I asked a psychonaut ""Why can't we remember before we were born unless life is some sort of test?"" And he said; ""As someone who has studied brain anatomy and neuroscience: Memories are formed and stored in the brain and you don't have one to form memories with until you are born and have developed for a while. Your thoughts and memories can be corresponded to the flow and interaction of chemicals in your neurons. It makes sense that memories from this life would only be tied to the neurons that exist in your current form. If you ever lived a past life, the memories of it left with the brain/body that was left in the ground."" ""To be fair, I think that on some level we do ""remember"" our past lives. Think about how we got here. We passed on knowledge to others and they continued to do the same in the name of progress and discovery. Think about all the tiny interactions those long gone did. Every interaction between them caused the universe to play out to how it is right now. Memory is just how 
we interpret the actions that came before. Our thoughts are usually words or feelings, and those are passed from person to person over time (and even person to animal). We're still passing those thoughts and feelings around to one another. The love and hate that is passed around came from somewhere, usually those older than us. But where does it stop? When did it start? Fun stuff to think about."" Another one said; ""you also can't remember what happened when you died in your last life. this is the immense power of _NAME_ which covers your consciousness and makes you forget your past lives. just think if you could remember all your past lives, and all the traumas you experienced. you wouldn't be able to handle all of that, and you'd crack."""
175887982,"Happy New Year to you, _AT_MENTION_ I’m glad you’re feeling optimistic. That’s quite an accomplishment considering the present times."

175887984,I don’t blame you. Doctor told me to stop if I get painful rash from lamictal. I never had it. I like lamictal. It works well except for memory issues.
175887985,Yo how’s it going? Great to see you.
175887986,and have complete and sane kids. that is a new one. can i do the ceremony?
175887987,Aps won t block all dopamine.if this were happen you were die.
175887988,"To paraphrase a famous quote: It’s amazing what we can accomplish when nobody cares who gets the credit. In the navy we were taught that we’re like a chain, so we’re only as strong as our weakest link. For example, our company (80 men including myself) had to perform various exercises. I remember the running exercise. I ran as fast as I could so that our company would have a fast time. I crossed the finish line, but the commander didn’t stop the stopwatch. I didn’t realize that our time was based on when the last guy crossed the finish line, not the first. I apologized to the company for breaking away from the pack–even though I didn’t know that was wrong. If this is a friendship that you feel is worth saving, apologize."
175887989,"For me its the sz that caused this. I was a better and smarter person before sz. Now I am not always mean but I am more irritable and nervous. Sometimes I am paranoid of ppl and feel that they want me bad things so I attack. Sometimes I attack physically my brothers for no real reason. I was much more violent without meds though, I threw knives at my brothers. Luckily he just bled a bit from his hand. They threatened me with cops many times."
175887990,Yeah. It’s been a while ll
175887991,I keep forgetting but tomorrow I’m gonna make sure to ask if I can use the treadmills here. I want to start exercising. I hope they say yes. I really need to get more physically active
175887992,I loved it as it helped me but it did make me gain weight. I gained about 26 kg I think. A bit heavy and sleepy but no other side effects I can think of. I think it’s a good medication but I don’t want to gain weight like that and even when I was eating tiny amounts I was still fat. I’m happy on latuda and hope it will continue to work well for me as it has less weight gain.
174326335,"Personally, after all these years for me it has only gotten worse luck off it has not been better…"
175887993,"Farming may be theoretically simple but it’s a hell of a laborious grind. Invaluable to society. But small-time farmers are getting scarce and the remaining ones have to tend to ever increasing plots. So it probably is fairly complicated now as well. Getting ever more technologically dependent. Anyways, Bloomberg doesn’t know ???? about farming."
175887994,It was exactly the same on that test as it was before I started the ability!
174326329,"My negative symptoms are manageable. They’re there and sometimes I can’t watch movies or TV shows because of the negative and cognitive symptoms, but my energy is overall much better than when I was on Invega Sustenna and when I was on Caplyta."

175887995,Try to find an excercise partner it may help
175887996,"I personally feel threathened by it because it’s all over the news… But yes, you are right. I might be catastrophizing it."
175887997,"I’ll definitely bring it up with my neurophysiologist next time I see her! Maybe we can increase my steroids more and decrease water intake or something. Definitely don’t want even more issues, if I can avoid them, as I get older!"
175887998,If it is any consolation there is no ‘natural’ reality so you’re probably not missing much.
175887999,"At the age of 13, demons started harassing me, telling me that I was a child of Satans. They told me that no matter what I claimed to believe or what I did that I belonged to the devil and had no hope of escaping my destiny of hell, etc. It wasn’t true, it isn’t true, it will never be true. But it has made me suffer over the years. As I’ve grown older I’m not attacked like I used to be, and I know it’s lies that I don’t need to worry about anyway."
175888000,"I’m staying home today. Just going to putter around the house. I have plenty to do if I get bored or I can relax and take it easy. I feel pretty good for waking up at 3 am lol. Nah, I always do that. Anyway, what are you doing today?"
175888001,Yes I do. Multiple times a day.
174326339,My new pdoc is wondering this about me. Apparently it is very unusual for someone with schizophrenia to have had zero positive symptoms for over 3 years.
175888002,"So I caught up on a lot of sleep last night, basically sleeping from half seven pm to eleven thirty am, with a twenty minute break at around two thirty am. I’m feeling much better, however I’ve missed the morning now for doing t’ai ji. I will still do it today, probably quite shortly, still doing moves 1-30 of the _NAME_ style form. Thank you."
175888003,"Haha I know but I use this government of Canada website to know new approved meds, I check it many times everyday https://hpr-rps.hres.ca/reg-content/summary-basis-decision.php"
175888004,"I commiserate with you, _AT_MENTION_ . I’ve been really stressed lately with helping my Mom, whilst trying to look after my other responsibilities and still trying to have a life. It’s even showing up on what I post on this forum. I wonder if maybe I’m starting to relapse, but I’m not hearing any voices or having any delusions. My thinking is rather erratic I think, though, and I just need something to “pour the hope back in my eyes”, to quote an old _NAME_ Plant lyric. I mean, maybe I really do need a girlfriend like I posted this morning, I don’t know."
175888005,Well done matey on getting out there. How did it all go?

If she says no I guess I’ll go to the emergency room and see if they’ll do it. I don’t know what else to do. I can’t believe it has all boiled down to this, I’ve been trying since June to get everything squared away but the bureaucracy has been unbelievable.

I mean how do they expect people who are at risk, who are in the greatest need for services to navigate this system to get the meds they need to survive.

Human blood cells contain many receptors and proteins involved in signaling that are also found in the central nervous system (CNS) and have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Results of previous research have shown a strong connection between cells in the blood and the way the CNS operates, making blood cells an ideal environment in which to test potential new drugs."

175888130,There was this guy in a mental hospital I was in that told us stories about his step dads that were like they came from the twilight zone. Sometimes the relationships between stepdads and their step sons is extremely violent.
175888131,A couple of years I’d say.
175888132,"Way back in the early 90’s me and my dad flew across the country to visit my step-sister who lived in W. _NAME_ for a 4 day vacation. The first day, we went out on our own and visited famous civil war battlefield sites. It was pretty neat, I still have souvenirs of a lot of those places. On the second day we visited _NAME_ Cemetery in _NAME_. It is one of the most impressive sites we saw while we were there. It was an endless sea of grass and white crosses where each soldier was buried. It went on forever. At one point, me and my dad were resting and as we were talking he just said, “They should raze the whole place and make it into a parking lot.” He was half-joking but a guy standing about 6 feet away from us overheard and he gave my dad a withering look and said in a southern accent, “You guys are from California, aren’t you?” And then he pointedly turned around and left. It was funny. My dad didn’t mean to be mean or disrespectful. But what was funny also was that my dad was so em
barrassed that he lost his confidence and we had to stand there until he felt better. That was the only time I saw him lose his confidence."

I think as long as they aren’t trying to make you feel bad in front of people it’s ok. However, it’s important to have a sense of humor about it. Yes -work on your social skills, always. But! Remember that no one really holds poor social skills against you in a real intense way (maybe some do, but those people are assholes)."

I am interested in learning more about your experience with access to mental health care services within your community, as well as how this has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I will be using this information to better care for my future patients. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, did you find that there were enough mental health resources in the community to assist you? Since the COVID-19 pandemic, have you encountered any difficulty accessing mental healthcare providers? I appreciate any input and inquiries on this topic. Ally"
175888229,"Literally, I've gotten that feeling the few times I've tried reading anything by Hunter _PERSON_ Thank you for sharing your Christmas story. Because your friend sounds just like me throughout my twenties. It's a trip having survived being that way and then hearing the other side. And the tendency to relapse is ALWAYS there. Reading your post was sobering. As the Wikipedia says, ""Personality disorders are a class of mental disorders characterized by enduring maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience , exhibited across many contexts..."". I wonder whether your friend was molested as a child, or was at the very least made a codependent by a primary caregiver. Some of the appeal you hold for him may resemble part of the appeal my schizoid friend holds for me. You embody many of the qualities he lacks but would benefit from cultivating.

But if I think about it from a person who has never really experienced clear symptoms of a mental illness perspective, Sometimes u feel alive and sometimes u feel drained. I don’t think ppl panic if they don’t have a diagnosis to associate that with. They may not associate feeling alive with the idea of recovery. In regards to feeling negative, everyone feels like that and more often than u would think. We forget that we’re all human and we get absorbed in thinking that we’re abnormal because of our emotions. If ur feeling guilty of that it only intensifies the draining of ur energy. I ignore those thoughts and focus on my hobbies or other interests so I can actually enjoy them."

175888265,"Ive been violent in the sense ive harressed people under a percieved threat, and threatening behaviour, with a bit criminal damage thrown in. Partly cos i was psychotic for years (had no insight) and the scummy area and property i was forced to live in. Mostly because when psychotic i used to go around saying that i loved children (AS A FATHER WOULD) - and drug addicted arseholes victimised me, took it the wrong way and ended up calling me a Pedo. I was deluded cos i thought i was an angel for children - so reported the lot of them to child services. It stemmed from the traumatic loss of my Daughter. So i posted flyers around the town i lived in - calling them unfit parents whilst being IV Users. Yeah i did myself no favours at the time. And the Police were bent at the time anyway."

175888288,"The problem is that diagnosing mental illnesses is a little different than physical injuries or illnesses. If you had a broken arm and your doctor diagnosed it as a broken leg then that would be obvious that you were misdiagnosed. The issue with mental illness is that the psychiatrist has to make a diagnosis off of what correlates best to our symptoms, but many illnesses have overlapping symptoms. The point being that there is trial and error involved with diagnosing mental illness and a patient’s diagnosis can be ever evolving. To prove that your p.doc was negligible in their diagnosis would be hard because their defense would always be something along the lines of “I gave the best diagnosis for what they presented.” Another issue you would have in proving you were misdiagnosed is that 3 p.docs can see 1 patient and come up with 3 different diagnosis. I’m not in anyway bashing the field of psychiatry, quite the contrary, I’m just stating that diagnosing a mental illness has different cha
llenges than diagnosing a physical illness. Mental illness is just as valid as any physical illness, but it’s not all too easy to see."

175888299,I haven’t changed my meds at all. I think the feelings of general crappiness and brain fog might be coming from caffeine withdrawal i have been trying to quit after drinking energy drinks every day. It is so hard and I think I am going to give up for now because I need to be able to study for my licensure exam. The migraines may also be due to caffeine withdrawal or may be caused by my frequent use of headache medicine. Or both.
175888300,"I came off for about 3 months, then had to go to hospital. I wasn’t able to sleep and when I cannot sleep there is always trouble. In reality, our dopamine receptors go into overdrive, when the drugs are withdrawn after years of being suppressed.

175888312,"My journey started with candy as a child. I liked how it tasted, Like how it made me feel, gave me energy, was a treat and a reward. That’s where It started for me, my first memories of the craving. Quasi Italian family, Kid drinking a small amount wasn’t uncommon. So I got a taste from that. Had open access to alcohol my entire teen years. I was that kid who always could get a bottle. Started partying from there, experimenting with pot and mushrooms, alcohol and cigarettes. Started moving and using coke when I lived In Vegas, helped keep me up all night partying in the swingers club. Experimented a lot with other drugs, but coke was my flavor at the time. Moved on to Rx from there, found a doctor feel good. He’d prescribe me opioids, benzo’s, stimulants. That lasted a few years. New York was all about the LSD, I’ve done hundreds, if not thousands of doses. I believed it helped train and prepare me for psychosis. If I could handle massive acid doses, I could handle my episodes. I was fool

175888314,There were many years where I was unable to laugh. I felt so tortured I couldn’t laugh. Ever. Years without laughter was awful but now I can laugh again thankfully. It took a long time to be able to laugh again so I am very thankful for my laughter when I have it. I don’t laugh every day or every week. Depends what’s going on and what I’m doing etc Sometimes I laugh by myself and I don’t know why on this conscious level. Like last time I went grocery shopping I was in a health food store and started laughing in the cashiers face.not sure why. I think on another conscious level I might have found something funny. I don’t usually laugh at comedy. Some exceptions. I have laughed at a serious scene in sons of anarchy that was definitely not funny said my x. I am so grateful to be able to laugh again. I don’t laugh often though. I would like to surround myself with some funny people sometimes but sometimes they are funny but not nice people who may be disrespectful and then you might not fi
nd them funny or avoid them. I would love to laugh more. I’m sorry for you that you feel you lost your humour. Maybe it will come back. Lots of comedy I don’t find funny at all and some comedy I dislike such as friends.never liked that show. I’m more of a Seinfeld girl.
174326381,i take clozapine too and i feel much better on it but i can’t see how people like elyn sasks and such get the energy to go outside… i’m scared of so many things and going out is really hard. But for her work she has to go outside so i wonder how she does that.
175888315,I’m on 75mg Xeplion. So my body has around 7-4mg risperidone constantly. I felt so much better on 50mg or even 2 mg risperidone held a job actually. I have talked with my doctor but she refuses to lower the dose. In 2 weeks I am going to my doc with my mom to explain to her that my life is unbearable as my psy doc thinks I am still delusional which is not and lowering the dose will get me into psychosis. I think more likely what will happen my psydoc will offer TCA’s and I will refuse and go home. It’s been happening for a half a year like this

175888335,"I’m still traumatized from 2014-2016 visits at the hospital. Happens because of aliens and stuff too like they sent me to other timelines or worldlines as some call it. So scary for me. Luckily, it’s 2021 and I’m getting and feeling better. Time heals most wounds I think. IIRC, my psychiatrist gave me adderall at the height of my psychosis and it just made me more delusional, paranoid, and psychotic. Not to mention the fear of the patients when I saw some of them wearing camo uniforms in a hospital for schizophrenics. I thought I was seeing clones and crap and I probably triggered them when I was talking and fearing for my life. Not sure how this helps me by sharing or why I am talking, but it scared the ???? out of me. I believe in aliens because I remember them in my dreams especially tall greys and crap. Like the EBENs. I pissed them off in a past life and they sent me to parallel universes where negative things happened to me and I was scared shitless and psychotic. I guess it was the Mon
tauk Project but I had no clue what was going on. I went through some monarch programming before several times. We cannot talk about conspiracy theories, but I get this from my dreams. I don’t know what comes first the chicken or the egg, but I think the egg in my case. I do need to stay away from some of that stuff but I researched and absorbed all the material. Maybe I was just targeted for my genetics and past lives like ahkasic records and crap. Stuff that doesn’t exist and 99.999% of people don’t believe. I really don’t want to talk about that crap here anymore, as I largely have isolated most of it to the back of my mind, but the trauma still haunts me in my subconscious and memories in my following reincarnated lives here on earth. Maybe there was no rhyme or reason just like I was randomly selected to be a Montauk Boy for eternity. Things have improved and gotten better though. I always thought it stemmed or started in university for some crap like I was targeted and part of me just tries to u
nravel the unending truth and mystery. Basically we live in some alien simulation I gather. I also think it’s because I posted I was a time traveler among other things on Facebook while psychotic and I became self-deluded into thinking I was the real _NAME_ (doppleganger) and that’s why I was targeted. If it was something else, I wouldn’t know or believe it and people make ???? up all the time, but aliens run or work with the montauk program. Part of me would like money or compensation but I rather just be left alone and live a peaceful life without money."
175888336,Hi _AT_MENTION_ ! I was diagnosed 3-4 years ago. Currently attending a day treatment program and will be going back to work soon as a part time substitute tutor. I hate isolation. 10 minutes by myself makes me lonely lol.

175888338,"One of my psychology teacher’s told me that researchers attempting to develop new drugs try to make mice which have human psychological disorders. It is really cruel but arguably for a good cause… To make “depressed” mice they are put in a bucket of water until instead of swimming around and around, they just give up and start to drown because they have “learned helplessness” (they have learnt that there is no point in attempting to swim). These mice are then given new antidepressants to see if they start swimming again. To make “schizophrenic” mice they experimented with social isolation - taking mice away from the mother and siblings but this was not enough. However, when they took mice away from the litter and then allowed them to see the mother mouse and siblings snuggling up together through a one way piece of glass, some of the mice developed symptoms that were arguably schizophrenic (I am sorry I forget what the symptoms were) and that were curable with anti-psychotics. These 
mice are or were used to test new anti-psychotics, apparently. I think that evolution is true, but that it does not explain the origin of the species, or enspeciation. Nature is continuous but humans see the species as being discreet. Some recent researchers combine evolution with semiotics, which comes closer to creation as a result of language. Let there be light."

174326384,"From my experience its atypical for there not to be some sort of drug use involved with onset of schizophrenia. I was the first person to not have a criminal record that my lawyer for the court hearing going over my involuntary hospitalization had had. I never really spoke with him, but thats what he told my mom. I think that what ever caused it in me was stress, emotionally. My parents were divorced and my mother was the morally superior but financially inferior parent so she got custody my dad was at fault in the divorce and generally we were just kids trying to love two differently flawed parents. My mom has a strong work ethic but I think academia was torture for her so menial labor in a factory was what she could handle. Factories in small town america are a dying breed and she struggled through NAFTA caused outsourcing. Between that and just growing up poor she didn’t have enough emotional softness in her to be very loving, while my dad was very loving in the short sporadic interactions we 
had. Emotionally fulfilling. So it was very stressful. I developed depression in middle school (now that I look back on it thats what it was) and barely managed to develop out of it into highschool. Homework was a mountain weighing on me every day with more piling up and I didn’t have resources to help me manage. I lied to my mom daily and felt huge amounts of shame and guilt. School in the mid 2000s expected hours of commitment to vigurously mentally draining challenging (as appropriate of course for development) work and I couldn’t hack it. My part time job at KFC (one of the notoriously crappy fast food joints) was way less stressful even though I was working in what I think was a poor performing store and I morally felt obligated to do my best for the owners, whom are just relatively wealthy chain owners using it for retirement money and such. I did that for half a year, and then I got paranoid that for some reason I would be fired. I was scared of getting fired and what it would do to my record so I 
quit. I felt shame again and fell back into depression I was unemployed and a leech on my mother and brother for a year. I couldn’t identify the emotional problem and I used entertainment to escape. I was constantly berated for not looking for a job, emotionally guilted for the strain I put on my family. I didn’t know I had an illness called depression. Then I got a job at walmart. That was a good time. I was a cart pusher. I was saving money again ( hadn’t spent my savings account money in the year of unemployment) My family life improved. I was outside, doing something physical with almost no negative interactions with people. It was a perfect menial job to recover from depression. I worked the job mercilessly, I did my absolute best to be the best employee I could be. I smiled constantly and knew that it could improve my mood. I noticed I was having trouble socializing when I had in store duties and was attempting to transition into the store when I found I was cognitively impaired. I’d played dece
ptively complex fast paced FPS shooters, various genres of books, and programs on the computer, but I was struggling to learn a device that was simple enough for the other workers to engage with. This was a weird subtle thing going on that I just brushed off, I enjoyed my out door freedom from managerial oversight. My bosses were just glad I showed up for days in the rain. Then the rain started bothering me, and I was dreading work and I called out several times in a week and then I was calling out for reasons that were delusional. I had my psychotic break. There really wasn’t room in there for a successful college education, and a well paying blue collar tech school job to enrich my social security. So now I’m hovering at the bottom of what SSDI provides and toughing it out. I’m trying to rehabilitate and find a path to long term success while I have “the freedom” to live on 720 dollars a month in a small rural town without a drivers license. The upside of coming out of this is that I have a lot of 
life left to live and a lot of room for improvement. My depression has finally been addressed and I’m challenging myself with games in new ways to try to hold the cognitive level that I still have for the long term.

I take Melatonin, Seroquel and Trazodone for sleep every night and it all works great. If I absolutely need to sleep and get up early, I take a Klonipin in addition. I have sza bipolar type and that is an infamous sleep wrecker."

175888367,Maybe it would be better not to watch or read the news because there is so much coronavirus reporting. It just makes me more worried. I think that all these negative news are not good for us and our mental health.

175888375,"Thanks Job , I appreciate this a lot. I’m hoping that I can get more involved in my faith. I haven’t started going back to church yet but I plan on it this weekend. I think I was at my best when I was in RCIA and had the faith community and was going to church regularly. It really made a big difference. That’s a giant part that’s been missing the past year or so. And college. I was taking classes then which was really fulfilling but now I have to pay off a debt to start again, that’s going to take awhile. Art is something I enjoy, and playing ukulele and other instruments. Maybe I could become an art therapist someday, that would combine two things I enjoy, psychology and art. I am impatiently waiting on getting the cat, _PERSON_. it will be so nice to have a furry friend around again. It’s so quiet and lonely without my girls. Monday I’m going to contact my care manager to ask for an update on the supportive employment thing so I can get started with that. I miss college so much , ca

174326403,"_AT_MENTION_ is right I think. There is a biological threshold where you can motivate yourself. If you have severe negative symptoms and stay in bed all day everyday like me, you won’t get better no matter how motivated you are. Avolition is a psychiatric symptom for a medical reason. For others it seems possible to do better because they’re above that threshold."

175888381,"I’m a recovering alcoholic, and I believe that alcohol played a role in making me psychotic. I would start drinking beer in the morning, and before the day was over I would have drank over thirty beers. I would go like that for five or six days and then have a serious hangover. Sometimes when I had the alcoholic shakes I was close to being psychotic. One time after a hard drunk I somehow figured out with my brilliant logic that they had pushed the button, and our nuclear missiles were headed towards Russia, and their missiles were headed towards us. I was wondering if it would do me any good to crawl under the bed."

I had a case worker who was an Occupational Therapist, and she kept on sending me youtube videos of people singing to lakes because in Japan it heals your soul apparently if you sing at a body of water.

I am sure she meant well, but I don’t buy the ‘eastern medicine’ stereotype/rebellious teenager fad ???? that she clearly bought into with her privileged India trips for 6 weeks at a time to Buddhist retreats yada yada What about you? What is the strangest thing a health care worker has tried to get you to buy into?"

I’ve been getting my protein from Slimfast, eggs every once in a while, tofu, beans and nuts and I’ve had 3 cheeseburgers to cheat. Oh and I’ve had chicken chili twice.

175888425,I gained 12 kg the first 4 years of treatment. The all of a sudden I lost my appetit and I started to eat healthier and I have now lost 7 kgs. I still have a disproported big _NAME_. But I don’t mind because lots of men at my age have a big belly. I think that quetiapine has made me less anxious and a lot less aggressive and hostile.

175888511,I had also felt the same problem. I never understand what should I do at this time I've struggled with my problems. So don't worry everyone has some different issues. I suggest consulting with a doctor at least once.
175888512,I don’t know if they feel they can put their stamp on peoples treatment. My CPN says that my old pdoc and me were too familiar with each other which was why things got ‘missed’. Not sure if I buy that!

174326426,"Are there any characters you’ve seen in books or on TV that you think have schizophrenia? For me I interpreted _NAME_ dolarhyde from red dragon/hannibal to be schizophrenic even though the author has never confirmed it. The fact that he gets command hallucinations, has delusions that he has wings and a tail, and hears a painting talking/yelling at him reminds me of schizophrenia."

175888539,"Not a great day for me... Just a bunch of arguing and stuff over stupid things. At least I could rehire my therapist, so that's good. Now for the pdoc. I think medication has little to no effect on some of my symptoms, such as the obsessive compulsive crap and the impulsivity and certain other things like anxiety. I suppose it controls the psychosis, but honestly I don't even know anymore!"

175888543,the reptillians are the aliens that are trying to control humanity. The conspiracy says they are the ones who started religion to control humanity.

But the reptillans are the ones pulling the strings…

175888558,"It also depends on who you are dating. I am dating a man who has a physical disability so told him about my illness. He likes me still. I am still seeing him after two years. The other men I told who were immature or callous left me in a hurry. But, initially they seemed ok but, of course, were not. Thus, if you like someone a lot and want them to be your friend too, there is no harm in telling them and seeing their reaction. I have not made close connections with people I have not told because I feel I can't confide in them about my personal problems. With lovers who come and go though, there is no reason to divulge. I don't know what the op is seeking but in a good relationship with anybody, trust and acceptance are issues that are important."
175888559,"In the end, at least for myself, I don’t regret not going to most parties or having more girlfriends when I was younger. One of my biggest regrets was not being happy, or at least content enough."

175888565,"IMO the biggest problems re UK mental health care are (1)years of serious underfunding that’s been a thorn in the side of providing good care in the community (2) too many people who should never have been allowed anywhere near a job dealing with mental illness . The care I got while in Essex was,without doubt, subpar . Character assassination was seen as preferable to actually providing decent and supportive care . It doesn’t take a genius to see something is very wrong when asking for more help and support gets you branded as ‘awkward,demanding and troublesome’. Here,on the other hand, there has been none of the animosity that was shown me in Essex . The pdoc has been friendly and polite, but still professional . Ditto the depot nurse that usually comes(currently having to self isolate because she’s at increased risk re the virus). Some of that better support has no doubt come from having my stepdaughter onside ."

175888568,I'm just admitting to myself how much worse my depression and anxiety have become since COVID-19 quarantine. I have become even more reclusive which is part of my depression issues. My anxiety and fear factor have increased substantially since the anarchy actions and the public opinions about defunding and defaming the police and our national history and laws. I've basically taken to bed and sleep away my life. Audio books and computer games are about the only thing that hold any interest for me. I feel like I'm such a downer that I can't be around people.
175888569,"I have had this for the past 6 or 8 weeks or so. I find that forcing myself out for maybe 5 minutes can really help me and yet, is not too awfully triggering."

I like to write. So I will take classes to help me develop writing and art skills."
175888571,"I’ve been on lock down too. I’ve seen you’re posts, you’re beautiful (like a person, like all of them). Give them a chance to know you. Solve problems, explore the world to the best of your ability, connect with the vastness of the available people in this world. Know it is only an exercise, and that the suffering is worth it and it will end."
175888572,I am happy to sleep 8 hours or less a day now but if I’ve nothing on I will often take a quick 20 minute nap. So good. I go from feeling slow and tired to having energy again…20 minutes for me is perfect.

In people with a first episode of psychosis in scizophrenia a good long-term outcome occurs in 31%, an intermediate outcome in 42% and a poor outcome in 31%.” Good outcome means they respond well to medication. Schizophrenia is more serious than what you think. en.wikipedia.org Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Major symptoms include hallucinations (often hearing voices), delusions (having beliefs not shared by others), and disorganized thinking. Other symptoms include social withdrawal, decreased emotional expression, and lack of motivation. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and in many cases never resolve.

It’s also in a really nice area north of the city. I keep looking for alternatives like living half way between there and school. But it’s only part time so would be a potential issue financially. Still a girl can dream."
175888582,These drugs seem so similar was wondering if anyone had experience with both and noticed any difference between the two. Which is more effective and which has less side effects?
175888583,"I have over one month clean. I started taking my medication regularly at certain times, not smoke weed or drink so much coffee. It has an addictive allure, so battling recovery from cocaine and also learning how to not be manic its difficult. I have always had bipolar tendencies on top of the schizophrenia. It makes schizophrenia harder to handle. Thank God I have never hurt anyone in my episodes, I have been reckless but not harm anyone. I scare myself when I am, I worry non-stop about fam. members and get paranoid about every possible event something bad could happen to the point it plagues me. This morning I feel a lot better, even though I had another weird event with technology. I got my bluetooth speaker to call my phone through _USER_ID_, and it was my old phone number that I had erased and changed through sprint to a new one. So i called and left a voicemail. And then I tried calling again and the feedback was so bad it echo’d out as if there were many spaces or dimensions…idk. But it w
eirded me out. How could I have called myself from a non-used number. Its almost as if the system has been set-up in the most corrupted fashion and there is no help to overcome it. I feel destined to fail at all I am done/barriers all around me. The more I tried to overcome or breakthrough the more paranoia began to become another barrier. Today I am going to have help cleaning the house and my bedroom, other rooms in the house. I hope this messy chaotic energy is dispelled and I feel better having a clean house. I’m listening to Phantogram which is the band I named my username off of."

No medications were allowed either - not even paracetamol. Learnt alot there- we had Shrinks from the home office to assess us. Shame it was the wrong diagonsis i had lol. I was a right loon in there, being an un-diagnosed Sz -with no access to Aps. I always knew PD was the wrong diagnosis for me anyway."

Tmg can raise ldl and total cholesterol if taken long term which dmg reduces cholesterol. Thus though all these give similiar effects some are harmful too if used daily.

Part 2 Caffeine is Good Guys was roughly based off this article from Anxiety.Org: Anxious? Drink coffee and focus on something Part 3: Schizophrenia, Bipolar, ADHD and Depression are cases of what they call hypofrontality or reduced brain blood flow in the thinking and self-regulation part of the brain. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypofrontality It turns out that caffeine reduces blood flow and reduces the diameter of blood vessels in the brain! The Effect of Daily Caffeine Use on Cerebral Blood Flow: How Much Caffeine Can We Tolerate?, Comparison of caffeine-induced changes in cerebral blood flow and middle cerebral artery blood velocity shows that caffeine reduces middle cerebral artery diameter.. So far 1 positive thing about caffeine is that it helps focus (although I’m not sure how this works) and 2 negative things are that it is a pro-psychotic a
nd that it reduces brain blood flow! Moreover, recent studies have shown that the alpha 2 receptor agonists such as Clonidinie and Guanfacine can treat hypofrontality associated with ADHD, PTSD and depression. (From Wiki).

174326435,"Hello everyone, once again, I ask that guidelines be followed and we continue the following discussion respectfully and with maturity. By maturity I mean that of a Public Elementary School Principal. Yes, that is a half jest. You see, in today’s world of socialization, modern day contemporarily populated areas are rife with folk of all sort. Many of us who have suffered and endured through the plight found in modern day medicational treatments and or remedial medicines have experience of being treated poorly. Today’s Mental Health Workers are a boon in comparison to those of yesteryear. One might say that in the 1000’s Common Era, many of us who have been diagnosed with mental illness(es) would have been burnt at the stake or pyre. So with that in mind, let us be less childish and more childlike in our honesty, or so I ask. If not, then please refrain from feuding replies. So without singling any particular user out, might we be adult and mature enough to share how we feel or what we are thin
king about the current state of affairs regarding schizophrenia.com, its forums, and the improvement of future mental health clinicians due to their experience and training? Okay, this is what I had been thinking before I typed this all up, (I will try to be politically correct so as not to come across as offensive.) I think that many of us sufferers who have familial support and a group of friends whom visit us regularly acquire a sort of miseducation by the way of a pattern of learned behavior at times referred to as helplessness. I will give an example of this behavior which I experienced first hand during a Cognitive Behavior Therapy Outpatient group. While everyone was willing to share a tidbit, there were two people whom had some concern. The first, he sought shampoo, toiletries, and essentials such as a toilet plunger. The second, I mean not to speak ill of this person, despite having a house to himself within walking distance of his own parents and likely being the most well groomed, spoke of his sist
er’s jealousy and then of his father’s uselessness, afterwards of his mother’s neediness. It was difficult to listen to and so I ended up moving on and seeking Outpatient Therapy elsewhere. The people I speak of are, to my knowledge, not forum members, they are, however, fellow sufferers. So what I really think is that the pattern of “woe is me” behavior tends to become an annoyance. Nonetheless, people do need help at times, yet there seems to be this misguided feeling of always WANTING to be helped. In my experience with mental illness(es) there are most certainly those of us who require attention and not just medical, still, there are less than urgent matters that emerge within the very same documented illness(es). My personal conclusion is that mental illness like any illness comes down to a case by case basis. In this way, medicine should be used vehemently to treat everyone. Instead, treatment and prescription may fall into an individual patient’s best interest in regards to convalescence an
d recovery. In short, the person who was hesitant to admit his troubles and the person willing to share everyone else’s but their own, taught me a most interesting lesson on a personal level, it takes self-discipline and responsibility or accountability of one’s own actions for a person to manage independence. What was I really thinking? I do not want to say for fear of being suspended."

175888653,"Well, my education about schizophrenia may not be as recent as yours. In 1997, I took part in a Schizophrenia Sibling Study in Washington, DC. I went to that study, and three of my siblings also went to those three days of testing. One of the simple features at that test was to answer 30 questions as to which side of the body. if either, was favored in each of the activities they asked about. I hold my cigarette in my left hand, but every other measure made me using my right side to the exclusion of my left side. Around that time, another study was looking at family movies of children who later became schizophrenic. The study was looking to see if five year olds and such who later became schizophrenics were already favoring one side to the exclusion of the other side. But your education may be more current than mine. Incidentally, at that test I got to make eye contact with the famous Dr. _PERSON_ and look at his face in person. He looked all right."

It premiered between 1683 and 1688. _NAME_ composed it, and while it's also among the shortest of operas, it's still played today. I've heard many different versions of it, it usually lasts anywhere between 45 minutes to an hour (where most operas are at least two hours, if not three hours). The story up to that point is a basic one. Woman loves soldier, war breaks out, soldier goes to fight, dies, and now she's going to commit suicide. This is the final piece of the opera. _NAME_ was the top of the top of the _NAME_, of that role, until _NAME_ did it. _PERSON_ is a legend, but so is _NAME_, and _NAME_ - for a lack of a better term - had a much darker register that _PERSON_ did.

174326463,Hello! I’m 24 years old female. I live with my parents and I don’t have a job. I suffer schizophrenia since high school. My mental health worsened in the beginning of September and even though I take my medication I find myself dreaming about different things and doing nothing the entire day. I feel really bad. I have different fears about the future which stop me from achieving my goals. I hate my family because they forever tell me that I fail at everything. I feel as if I’m being told what to do the entire time. I’m really depressed. I have 2 friends that speak to myself only in case they need something. I’m just not sure if I should speak to them any more. I’m not sure how to explain this but I’m scared from different things that may happen and I just keep on lying in my bed doing nothing at all. I believe that if I start doing something positive the rest of the people get to be somehow jealous and they use me for things they need all the time. The worst part is that they forever w
in the arguement and i can’t tell them anything. This is what drives me scared. I just wanted to share this with you. There is no one in real life who cares about myself. …
175888744,I’m just worried something bad will happen. They say it’s nothing like the psych ward but still it’s with people I don’t know

175888752,"It’s an appeal then? I think that’s more common than getting it the first time around. It was 10 years ago for me, and I guess the most pivotal thing that occurred is that I told my interviewer that I “Thought I was a famous person”. I halfway expected him to ask, but then again it was probably in my files. I guess I’m sorry that you’re only looking at 650… what line of work are/were you in?

174326466,It’s been a month. I’m still having some issues with what I think is voices when waking up and I have word salad. Still having nightmares too. Got put back on Zoloft. Found out I have frontal lobe epilepsy a week ago and they put me on lamictal.
175888792,"Could you explain a little more, what do you mean? I don't understand, not sure. Yes, I noticed. Imo, it's guided. There is a general dissatisfaction, and I guess some political forces managed to take advantage of general dissatisfaction. I do not believe in spontaneous, popular movements, uprisings, and so on. But I don't want to go off-topic, then I stop. It makes sense, thanks. I can relate, I feel the same when I feel an intense anger. My suggestions were thought for a child, because I assume that it's easier to distract him. However, when I suffer for freedom's limitations, I find it useful to focus on what it's allowed. It's always good to discover how much we can do inside our space. Another point is to remind that we are accepting rules voluntarily, because we calculated that the other option would be less good. Nobody else has the real power to condition our lives. Sometimes, it helped me realize the source of my feeling too. In my experience, the feeling of being caged, is sometimes due t
o a structural, excessive self-control, that we project against limits outside. Bars outside aren't so much disturbing, when we don't perceive an inner cage. The more we perceive an inner cage, the more we need to “explode” against external “bars”. In fact the two situations are similar: there is too much control. Sometimes it's enough if you let yourself go, “lose your head”. Humor is very useful: it's illogical, it gives freedom and lightness, it's outside the bars. Or you feel satisfied if you allow yourself to be irrational, crazy, stupid, wrong, everything you want... do not pretend to be this or that – allow yourself TO BE everything. No need to act destructively, it's about who we are allowed to be. Do you easily let yourself go or are you able to do it just through external explosions? And there is a physical factor, too: for example, breathing out helps to lose control. Maybe if we lose control voluntarily, by suspending demands, it's easier that we don't lose control unintentionally, t
hrough violent explosions. In this case it's not placation: paradoxically, it's the external explosion that is a placation."
175888793,I went to hospital ten times mostly voluntary but the last one or two my husband wanted me to go and i didnt want to and my pdoc suggested it too. I think it was what they call assisted admission. I was in five different hospitals. Two private psychiatric clinics and two government psych hospitals and one general hospital in emergency room and psych ward. The psych ward was the worst - they locked you in a room with no books or therapy activities and it was so boring and I missed my husband so much. The last three times I went to that hospital. Recently my pdoc suggested hospital again and I refused saying I will just increase my meds. Hoping to avoid any eleventh time. It’s getting too much!
175888794,"Seems to be a common thread/theme on this website every couple of days lol. I don’t know. It doesn’t matter since I cannot do anything anymore. I would say 120 based on my life experiences, which seems both high and low. I think math majors average 130 and I failed as a math major at a top school while dealing with schizophrenia so maybe that’s true. Stuff I rather not talk about. My IQ fluctuates and I always felt IQ or at least mine was fluid and has changed throughout my life. Google even did talks about fluid intelligence. I had one psychiatrist who said mine was 110 based on my vocabulary and interactions while others have said I was gifted and agreed that I was probably not a genius but gifted at least. I might have _PERSON_’s too. I find it difficult to brush teeth, change clothes, work, get a girlfriend, make money, go to school, cook, and do basic things around the house. IQ is meaningless in that area. I score below average. I used to do these things flawlessly before schizophreni

I’m not taking anything, but the effects that I have from taking medicine, at least after a while tend to last for like 6 months. So I’m kind of hanging in there and hoping for the best. It’s unfortunate that you can’t read books, but at least you can read at least some articles and this forum. I’ve read today that 70% of schizophrenics have acquired dyslexia and that 50%(probably including me, including before I had SZ) have a reading level below 8th grade. My vocabulary is good, but my speed wasn’t perfect, at least compared to most people in my level classes."

How was it for you? Did you know a long period of loneliness and when your meds started to work, you started to socialize more? I wonder if its possible first to get better even without people around you… I am afraid, that I can find myself once really alone…"

175888904,Sz and associated disorders are those of perception. It attacks the very basis of your thoughts and it attacks the very core of your identity. Like I’m a straight male but when psychotic I had this overwhelming urge to kiss one of my male managers at work. It all was a little strange but meds helped me move forward with my life enough to have decent relationships with others which had previously escaped me… If I get you right I don’t think it’s anything unusual. Questions of sexuality seem very common to me from reading other peoples testimony so get the meds right and things will sort themselves out. Nothing wrong with being gay if your gay. Straight if your straight. Sz will often confuse even the basic things.

So, the raw willpower approach works, for one. If it feels like ????, just keep pushing, kind of thing. Anyone know of supplements that can make the struggle easier though? I’ll start with caffeine, the age-old pick-me-up. Maybe L-Theanine too? Sarcosine? Would like personal experiences in the thread about whatever works. I want this to be a central hub for things that clearly help with overcoming negatives, cause they’re really plaguing the SZ community. I think exercise is one too, but there’s just this clawing internal weakness that is making me feel so powerless, making me just want to do something easy. Bah!"

175888921,"None of this is scientific: I believe everyone has a bit of narcissism as a personality trait; it can crop up in different scenarios. When it is pathological (malignant?), that’s when it causes misery for the narcissist and the people ‘he’, or slightly less often ‘she’, tries to form relationships with. (Friends and significant others, acquaintances). I think narcissists make terrible significant others. They will make you miserable. Stay away from them, they implode and explode, the relationship might be a nightmare. The narcissist is miserable, the narcissist lives with a nasty relational strategy which was formed early in life. I believe narcissism is a style of buoying an unstable sense of self. All of this writing, it is what I think on the top of my head. The narcissist is not sadistic (my guess) rather, he simply must hurt himself and others to feel like he is being seen and felt. He must feed his parasitic fantasy-twin by hurting people, so they know what not being acknowledged or 
praised feels like to him. Narcisistic parents produce narcissistic children. It is heritable (genetic). Also, narcissistic parents will ignore a child’s emotional needs, lavish the boy with attention, or praise him for upholding the parent’s imaginary image of what he should be as a representation of the parent’s exceptionality. The child may be praised as “exceptional” by the parents or others, then they learn to crave that attention…they build their personality around the assumption that they must recieve their prerequisite (presupposed?) attention and admiration…just for being them and existing!"

It was good except the price. Recently, I realized that I failed to keep keto diet and it wasn’t that effective for me, but with the intermittent fasting, I was able to see some results. So, I’m a little hopeful now."

I thought like 3 groups of different people showed up that i was talking to online during my psychosis. They were hackers and knew alot about me. The second time i went was like a year later where i took x5 my dose of risperidone because i thought it would get rid of the voices. I was soo messed up lol, thought i was gonna die.

175888955,I am doing really well and am stable and symptom free pretty much and have gone down from 120mg latuda to 80 mg and now I want to go down to 60mg. My thought is if I get symptoms the medication may work better if I’m on a lower dose and just increase the dose also I have been told medication is not so healthy but it does help and I am grateful for our medication. I don’t plan on going off my medication entirely which I used to want to do but now i just want to lower the dose as I don’t think I need a high dose right now. When I came off medication before it was to lose weight or just because I did not think it was helping and in Sweden I was on medication that made me worse.i was on medication that is illegal in other countries and I had voices for years and they went away when I went off my medication. Years later I had delusions that went away on medication. Good for you that you have custody of your son. to you both.

I buy mock meat and cheese which taste great and are said to contain a lot of good but they are expensive. I plan on having vegan sausages for dinner tonight with onion, hash browns , gravy and vegetables.Delicious and easy to cook. I went to a dietitian previously who said my diet was good but I ate fruit salad every day for lunch with co yo back then but I feel I can’t afford that now and it’s a lot of work cutting it all up.so delicious though. I should try to find a cheap chilli recipe because my food I eat is really expensive and I spend three times as much as I did when I was not a vegan. Minestrone soup is pretty cheap if you use frozen vegetables but I’m on a gluten free diet aswell and gluten free pasta is more expensive. I stopped eating bread because vegan gluten free bread is too expensive at $10 a loaf I don’t want to buy it often but 
I found wraps on sale for 90 cents and they are not gluten free and I immediately go constapated. So as soon as these wraps are finished I will get back on my gluten free diet. The dietician might advise me to not eat hash browns or to eat smaller portions. Not that much to lose really 5-9kg)but it just won’t go.

175888995,_AT_MENTION_ thank you for sharing. The biggest addiction I struggle with is cigarettes. They seem to sedate my mood slightly and it really helps a lot. I used to make music and perform in concert until COVID. COVID has really made my life into a nightmare as far as stripping me of the things I was passionate about and using as healthy hobbies.

175889000,"""There's a phenomenon called ""SAS - Stimulant-Antipsychotic Syndrome"" and psychiatrists don't know about it. I'm one of the few to be on both. I didn't take ADHD med in 48 hours and I was dying of tiredness. Intense tiredness and mental pain that manifests itself as physical pain in my mind like someone was pulling out my organs. I don't know how else to explain it. When I took my morning meds, within half an hour, I was completely normal again. Sometimes a psychiatrist says ""Stimulant addictive blablabla"" and take me off of it without tapering down. What needs to happen is to TAPER DOWN. Not take me off the stimulant completely and make me suffer of movement disorders like dystonia or parkinsons symptoms or take me off the antipsychotic completely and make me suffer of full blown psychosis and anxiety. Everything needs to be handled with severe caution. I'm telling - (You crazy Facebook people) - About my problems so I have proof if any doctor does malpractice."""

I literally hate life and this puzzle. I've been neglected my whole life and focus on all the negative things that have happened to me. All I am is an entity that acts and I don't want to act anymore. I just want to be myself. But I hate myself. I want to be better. To transform. But negative symptoms get in the way.

Sometimes I feel like I lost the ability to just think about things in an abstract way and not think of words and explanations that the voices will understand. Anyone thought about this or successfully got their ability to think in abstract terms back? It doesn’t matter too much because the voices can see any images I think of or thoughts I’m thinking anyway, but just thought I’d ask. I hate when every thought and feeling I have feels like it is being evaluated and scrutinized. Would be nice to not explain everything to the voices all the time."

This was so I was poor enough to get a free flat and benefits. Luckily once I came to and realised what I had done, I managed to get the money back.

175889122,"You are young and there is a good chance that you can recover fully from your sz, but it’s about finding the right time to try it. The first you need to aim for is finding stability which is what the meds are helping you with. When you have been stable for a long time, like a year, you could ask your doctor to lower your dose and if you still feel stable after that, well then maybe you can quit. If you do quit right away you risk having another episode which may set you back, you might experience paranoid thoughts, have fallouts with people and drop out of school for a couple of months which will hurt your life. You would maybe need to attend school for a extra year. The best advice we can give you on this site is don’t do anything rash like quitting your meds without having your doctors approval. And the fact that you need to ask the question if you faked it or not means that you probably didn’t. “Faking it” or having a altered personality is a common sign of psychosis."

I think it lowers serotonin, but I can’t remember exactly. Either way, alcohol over time will lead to high rates of depression and suicidal thoughts."
175889155,"This is what happened today. This is from my insta. “A lot of crap happened this morning before 8am. I had went to get vape juice less than a mile away from home. When I walked out of the store and tried to get into my car, I couldn’t. The key fob was dead. It was freezing. I couldn’t feel my fingers, and I was scared. I called my friend _NAME_ and I was afraid she might not answer. She did though, thankfully. While I was on the phone with her a man pulled up and asked if I needed his help and I started to panic immensely within myself because I’m alone in a parking lot, I can’t get in my car, it’s dawn, and I already have men coming up to me. I told him a bit of my situation and he tried to get my key fob open to get my spare key. Eventually he did. But then another man pulled up and he happen to be wearing a _NAME_ dealership shirt. I didn’t think about it or even notice it. I was just panicking my heart out. I didn’t know who these men were. The _NAME_ Dealership guy eventually w
orked his way into my car and a million things were going through my head. He helped me start my car. I looked at him and started crying and said “Thank you, sir”. He closed my door and took off. And just like me with my panic and having only lived in a small town for 2 years by myself, with majority being white (with consideration of everything going on in the world lately), I looked around my car to make sure nothing was stolen. Every little thing was there. I just cried and cried all the way home. Not only was my faith in humanity restored but someone or something was obviously watching over me. I kept thinking back to the bracelet my Mom gave me 2 days ago. I cried for an hour for so many reasons other than the fear I felt. Don’t lose your faith in humanity. This has taught me such a lesson within society. Not all people are bad. Not all white people are bad. Someone’s always watchjng over you. These men happen to be in the right place at the right time and even one was a _NAME_ mechanic. God bles
s these good people. I owe my life to Christ. This situation could’ve turned out any which of way.”"

And losing touch with reality can sometimes be about the government? It's all tricky stuff. Sometimes on edibles, you get high.. Sometimes you don't.. also depending on the dose.. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.. Is that with edibles, there's warnings on them that say ""Don't take another one if you don't feel like it kicks in!!"" lol.. Cuz many people do that... They eat one cookie and then are like ""I'm not high.. I'll eat another 12 cookies""... NOooooo lolo nononono... Bad trip bad trip abort abort.. But you'll be good.

174326551,"There is more to life than work, but doing something with your day is more important. If you really want to prove you are not sz to a doctor then look at the criteria a psych uses to diagnose you. Identify all the factors and do the exact opposite to prove that you are indeed not sz. That means taking up a hobby, other than ruminating all day and getting obsessive with your intellect. You don’t have to work to prove you function. Take up art or photography. Get out into the street and do stuff, even if it is just going to a café. Join a club of what interests you. All these things prove you don’t have negative symptoms of sz. SZ maybe a social construct, and society may well be wrong to judge it. Society is where we live however and dealing with it or ignoring it, and just getting on with life with scant regard to how others perceive you is a difficult trick to manage. Achieving this is the ultimate aim. Since I started meditating daily for 3x30 minutes a day a few years ago, I have gained so

175889234,"I want to start with how life changes so much and from my own perspective it can change for the better to know who really matters at the end. No matter what you’re going through and how you’re going through it, if there are people that are there for you even with small intentions is because they care about you and they are trying. If no one is there, is okay as well. I personally don’t think is you not trusting others or other trusting you; I think is you not believing in yourself. It makes me smile that you’re recovered and that means you’re a warrior in life. Trust comes from within, not from others accepting you. Trust your path, your vision. I haven’t had friends in a really long time and what I have learned is that is okay for now I need to trust myself that I will have those friends that I deserve when they come. When these beautiful lights (friends) come to you is because you have trusted yourself enough to know who is and will be there no matter what. I haven’t found my tribe 
or people yet but I believe in myself and believe that other can believe in themselves like you. Keep your shoulders and head high. Be proud of yourself and even with rough obstacles keep trusting yourself. If you need someone to listen to, don’t hesitate in messaging me. Good luck and remember trust comes from within."

174326592,"I take Clopixol. It’s quite an old drug, dating I think from the 1970’s. It works well enough, I take 400mg per 4 weeks, which is a moderately low dose. I’m excited for the future, because I previously relapsed when having medications reduced, but it hasn’t happened this time. For some reason I respond to depot injections, much more than oral medication, which I often forgot to take or took at different times of the day. In regard to supplements I’ve discovered that folic acid has been useful in dealing with symptoms, I also take magnesium and Omega 3. I also take 500mg of Niacin each day, of course it doesn’t cure schizophrenia in itself, but last time I went off it I had a relapse and Niacin is good for moderating sex and stress hormones. 500mg each day is actually quite a low dose, I would rather take more, but my parents disagree. If it isn’t combined with a reduction in toxic habits etc. Then it won’t make much difference, but I’m very happy with the results from Niacin suppl

175889410,I was useless at sports. At my public school most boys played rugby. The not so able ones of us played football. I was usually chosen last for a side. I was then put in goal incurring the wrath of my team mates as I let in umpteen goals . The worst place to put a poor player is as the last line of defence. As I was perhaps the most unpopular boy ever at that school I suspect it was done deliberately as a further excuse to bully me.

It was restricted to persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorder using antipsychotics. Multivariate analyses were used to compare baseline functioning and cognitive characteristics in clozapine users vs. users of other antipsychotics.Of the 675 patients identified in the REHABase, one out of ten (n?=?70) used clozapine. Compared to users of other antipsychotics, clozapine users had been more frequently hospitalized in psychiat
ry and presented less frequently with psychoactive substance use. Functional measures did not significantly differ between the two groups. Clozapine users had poorer short-term verbal memory performance than users of other antipsychotics and did not differ on executive performance.Clozapine users may reach a recovery level comparable to that obtained in persons without treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In order to reduce the negative impact of memory deficits on the recovery process of clozapine users, it is necessary to optimize their psychotropic treatment and to promote their access to cognitive remediation programs addressing their specific needs."

Originally I was going back for my CDL, but was talked out of it. 14 hour days are too much for me to handle. contact your unemployment office and tell them you’ve been on disability and they can direct you to a govt. agency that can appropriately place you in work.

They have never asked me how I spend the money. Don’t tell them anything that they don’t ask. I think they know some of us spend our money on silly things though, as we are mentally ill. I spend my money frivolously at times too. It’s a problem and talk to your therapist about your spending too!"
175889496,"Well, it doesn’t sound like a huge deal so far. It’s just the specter of it escalating and turning into abuse that’s looming in the background. As you know, schizophrenics are more susceptible to drug or alcohol abuse than “normal” folk. No one sets out to be an alcoholic or a drug addict, alcohol and drugs are just insidious and people often don’t recognize they are crossing the line until it’s too late. It happens to the proverbial soccer mom, it happens to bankers, it happens to airline pilots, it happens to a neighbor or friend, it happens to construction workers etc. and it can just as easily happen to you."

175889542,"omg that’s terrible, we’re gonna come over to your thread with a ruler."
174326624,"I think you’re probably delusional. That’s ok. I don’t think slavery means paying for my living needs and letting me dick around with the small amount of money left over after necessities. I think being open about your delusions is important, once I felt comfortable talking about it, I was able to remove some of the “sacred” sort of awe emotion that I associated with it, (wrongly btw) and start treating it seriously as an idea and work through it with rationality. There’s still an urge and fondness that is unnatural about the delusion I used to get captured by but I know when I’m not delusional that, its just a pretty unlikely idea and a delusion. When I’m delusional I get taken up by it, and enjoy thinking about it, and the feelings I associate with it, but I still doubt in my heart of hearts that its real, in some small way like a nagging idea, sort of just like how a delusion feels when you’re not actively delusional. Still thanks for sharing bud, I hope you feel less paranoid 
eventually. No reason to be afraid in this world. We have power to fight against all sorts of things even super powerful corporations, it just means we need to be more creative.

175889545,"Thank you! Yes, I am worried about being seen as doctor shopping. I know the psychiatrist checked some state database on me while I was sitting in the room with her! I thought that was kind of crazy and borderline rude to do it right in front of me but whatever, I wasn't lying to her. I just went to the new doctor's office today and they required me to fill out a medical history release form before they'll even see me. So I filled it out today. This doctor is closer to me anyway though (10-min. drive versus 30 minutes; I live in a rural area), so it would be more convenient for general check-ups as well. The psychiatrist I saw a couple times was a 45-minute drive away. I'm glad the Celexa is helping you! Maybe I'll be okay without the Xanax, as long as I can get some if I ever have to fly for work again since I'm severely claustrophobic. A lot of my anxiety was due to my ex so finally cutting him out of my life completely has helped immensely, and also I think quitting smoking again has helped me a 
lot, too. Thanks for all the support."

175889549,"I was Social Distancing as a lifestyle long before it had a name and spend the vast majority of my time home alone. The only thing that sets one day apart from the next is what's on TV that night, if I have an appt, go shopping, do laundry and mundane things that wouldn't get done unless I did them. I've learned to manage my time so I don't get too bored by working with computers for a week or so, then switch to video games for a while, listen to music, watch TV, etc. I have house plants that inhale my carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen I breathe in instead of a doggy that needs to go for a walk at 12am to go poo. Including a Peace Lily close to 40 years old I bought my Grandma when she was in the hosp. in 1982 that's outlasted 3 wives and a dog. I live a modest lifestyle in relative comfort within my budget. I have collected more cool stuff over time than one person should have and nobody to leave it to or deserves it when I'm gone."
175889550,"_PERSON_, I hope you are able to get more cbd. It really helps a lot with pain, anxiety and sleep. GuitarGERD, I am glad that the lozenges are working good for you.

Cold here and snowing. Tomorrow is supposed to be nicer. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175889551,"Hopefully they will get some help this time. It was wrong of them to ignore you last time you talked to them, them not listening is why it probably got like this. They will be able to get some help, even if you have to go hospital and see one of the doctors that will be there. Sorry that you are struggling, I know what it can be like."
175889552,I’m sorry. I struggle with anxiety too. It’s awful. Hopefully you feel better soon
175889553,No I don’t think it was the fridge. It’s a new fridge. This sounded “human” It wasn’t coming from that direction anyway.
175889554,"You seem philosophical which I can totally relate to haha. I think you have to accept where you are right now so to speak so that you don't feel guilty for not being ""better"" but at the same time recognize that you want to improve yourself and then work toward that. I understand feeling like every day is the same. I hate my job but when I think about quitting, I'm like well I don't have any more qualifications than I did 3 years ago when I started this job so I'm not going to get anything better but on the other hand I feel like I'm wasting my life going somewhere I hate every day for 9 hours. I think you have a point about working on yourself though. You have to make sure you do something each day that you actually enjoy so life doesn't seem so pointless. I'm working on trying to write a book right now, its long shot but I enjoy it and its what I want to do so I keep making myself work on it. Maybe, you can start a new hobby or an old hobby again, it sounds dumb but it helps me a little to feel 
like each day I am getting better at something. Each day is a little different from the last in a way."

175889563,"my parents were loving but strict and i rebelled. dad was a workhorse, we still sometimes butt heads over things. he has his own political and religious truths and is not very open minded. i get mad at him for arguing about politics on facebook, even though he is a dedicated christian. i feel it just drives a wedge between himself and others by doing so. he could use a little more social grace. he’s also a bit controlling which shouldn’t surprise you. mom is a bit more social, and gets along well with others. she has a wealth of experience she calls upon from her life and has a bit more social grace. but i think if sza is genetic, it most likely came from mom’s side, she can get moody and often times isolates with her books. she has yelled at me countless times, and it just rolls off my shoulders. i feel like she would love me more if i lived on my own. she was always visiting for lunch and what not when i had my own apartments. now im probably a bit of a burden for her. she thought i would g
row up and become an adult, which i kinda am, but kinda not. overall they are good people. we spend a lot of time together, so i often get tired of their company."
174326633,"I think for me it is mostly luck. My genes and environment sure helped though. I mean we are all unlucky enough to become schizophrenic but for some reason I have been able to have some accomplishments like being able to work for more than thirty five years. And what’s amazing to me is that I’ve read that the schizophrenics with the best prognosis are the ones who were well adjusted before they got sick. I have never been well adjusted. And it shows in some of my jobs where I don’t talk to anybody and take my breaks alone. Some jobs I talked enough and made friends but for the most part I keep to myself. I should have said this in the beginning but after I got diagnosed at age 19 the following two and a half years were solid suffering with no relief even for a minute. I was severely Ill. First in a group home than 8 months n a hospital. Doesn’t sound like much of a success story, does it? But this is where luck comes in. Through a series of small steps in some very good group homes and very 
good programs I was helped and encouraged by staff and they gave me a little responsibility , a little at a time and I succeeded until eventually, 9 months out of the hospital I got my first job with my illness. And stayed for four years through many ups and downs. And I 've been working almost steadily ever since. My (relative) success might be summed up in three simple sentences: Lot’s of help Lots of hard work Lots of luck. At the beginning of my disease nothing differentiated me from the people I lived with in the group home and the hospital. I showed no more promise than anyone else. But then after those initial two years I started slowly integrating into society. I remember in a supportive housing program in 1984 I had two friends and neighbors and one day they invited me out to lunch with them. I didn’t think we were allowed to or something but we went to a food court and ordered Chinese food and I was eating and looking around and marveling that we got to do this with all these “normies” in th
e crowded cafeteria. Well, I evolved past that awe and wonder and over the years I have gone all over and done all kinds of things and while there’s a small part of me that still feels like an outsider, I still do a helluva a lot. All I can say is if there’s a rule that I can’t go where I want and do what I want, I never got the memo. I am just wired so that I expect to be able to work, live independently, drive a car, and go to school. I’ll always be an outsider wherever I live, wherever I go. But usually I’m having too much fun or I’m too busy to remember it and let it bother me."
174326631,"I am doing fine today. Just wanting to drink copious amounts of coffee and not thinking I should. But that's fine. That's my life every day, pretty much. I stay up too late, get up too late, but I am doing fine. I am not productive enough, need more than 24 hours in a day because I have too much stuff to do, almost have a job now, but not quite, because they haven't quite hired me yet. But that is okay. I will see if I get the job. I never really thought life would be this way, where I am administrating my life basically all from home, but that's fine, too."
175889564,"It does nothing for me. I don’t want to dissuade people from it but it’s just talk. I talk all the time, and it’s sometimes helpful. I can figure out these things on my own with the help of the internet. Coping skills, similar stories to study, self-imposed exposure therapy, I just have all the tools I need without someone else asking the questions. If it helps you though go for it. It seems to do very good things for many people who do it, including I believe my hero _PERSON_."

174326630,I drive just fine…it depends on the person as well as what med you are on i think. Like when i was on geodon i could not drive because it sedated me so badly and made me feel like fainting in the heat. I got into one accident and after that stopped driving until I was off of it. If you know your meds affect you like that it is better not to drive. Or if you get really distracting bad hallucinations it is probably best not to drive too.

Several bad episodes in mental hospital - shouting matches, fights, verbally abusing nurses Since 2017 was on Olanzapine, and felt all the persecutory beliefs and magical thinking just vanish Finally got control of my mind.

175889598,Taking meds will help give you insight to your delusions!! For me the delusions were so believable when I first experienced them that I ended up getting arrested the same day and spent the summer in 2 psych wards. I was off meds but since then mostly I’ve been on meds. And I’ve learned that…well if I act up like that I get arrested and I guess I had to learn the hard way in that sense. Since then I’ve been in psych wards but not arrested.

I was able to distract myself with some activities and yeah here I am writing to you. Not gonna lie I still feel ( or perhaps imagine) symptoms of the brain eating bug because of the water I sniffed accidentally in the shower. But I am trying my best to keep busy with something that I like (probably reading a book) before It is bed time. Last night's sleep was not a good quality sleep since I went to bed freaking out. But for me, I feel like herbal teas (chamomile particularly) are quite relaxing as well as breathing exercises (they only help my during a panic attack). Sorry if I am scaring you or causing you any distress. Somebody said... She prefers to put me on an antidepressant but I don’t really think those work for me. I am not surprised actually since antidepressants are stimulants which can make your anxiety worse. As far as I know sin
ce I am a health student but anyways the doctor should know better than me of course. It's actually a good thing that you are aware of your problem, that's the first step of the solution. Somebody said... I do breathing exercises and stuff to try to get the thoughts to go away. They do, but it still bothers me. I am the same! I try to make myself think more rationally to get out of situations like this but as soon as there is a new trigger, there i s a new struggle. Somebody said... _PERSON_, is the waiting list in your area long to see a psychiatrist, or is the waiting list long to see a therapist? Or is the line long for both? Also, is your family doctor familiar with psychiatric medications? If he or she is, then maybe he/she can prescribe you medication to calm you down while you wait to see a therapist. It is a psychotherapist. I could honestly use the consultation services that are open for walk ins but I really think I need a professional help not only consultations. I never thought of asking her if sh
e could prescribe me those meds. I guess I can try asking her in my next visit."

Everyday I feel very bad as my symptoms affect my family relationships and my relationship with my boyfriend and the fact that the new medicine does not help. My boyfriend and I wanted to get engaged next June and I hope we can have a baby. But if I switch back to solian at this point, that means I am rather hopeless! As Solian is not recommended for pregnant woman and also it affects my periods which makes the whole thing impossible.

ounds stupid. But recently in the past two months my schizophrenic stage is coming back and worse this time. I’m the most paranoid I’ve ever been (I think people poison my food, plates, drinks) I constantly think my gf is cheating on me. There was one morning were I was waiting for the bus and this old woman gave me a sweet, I thought she poisoned me and had a panic attack. I’ve hallucinated but only at night, I saw a clown hiding at the end of my bed watching me and I saw something hanging of my light (which _PERSON_ can happen to people with no mental illness). I’ve Been noticing a huge amount of coincidences that all link together and That’s convinced me we’re in a simulation or we don’t exist at all. I’ll notice things in my peripheral vision that aren’t there when I look. I don’t know if I’ve had auditory hallucinations, but I think i might of. My thoughts will sometimes become external. Even while writing this I stopped multiple times as I heard laughing coming outside of my room a
nd I thought it was because I was writing this. (Which it could be). My girlfriend says there’s definitely something wrong."
175889713,"There’s nothing bad in you, _AT_MENTION_ , nothing at all, and while I do think that beating yourself up over this is unhealthy and counterproductive, you must understand that not all guilt is misplaced. Its primary purpose is to serve as an alarm that goes off as soon as any potential transgression is detected. You know that you have a history of missing things due to your anxiety, and you knew it before you allowed your son to get excited about these trips. You knew that he may not have gotten to go on all these class tripe and instead of sitting down with the child and explaining the situation, you chose to just not take him to school and allow his excitement to turn into pain. When I was in 5th grade, our class was going on a camping trip near the end of the year (we got the information sometime during the 1st few weeks of school. I told my parents, and they signed my permission slip and everything. Sure, it cost money, but they had that all taken care of. I got more and more excited as the t
rip _NAME_ nearer; packed my bag and everything. Then, the night before the trip, my parents called me into the living room and said that I wouldn’t be able to attend because my dad had “forgotten” about the payments. So, yeah, I didn’t get to go. I was pissed then, and honestly, I’m pissed now. I know that it’s been a literal decade, but I was so fu cking excited and my dad just didn’t care. He never even apologized. My point is that your son very well may remember this if the memory is attached to any sort of pain. Do what you can to work on this behavior, but don’t try to hide it from your child, if for no reason other than the fact that it’s insulting. Children above a certain age really do understand that their parents aren’t perfect. Just be honest. I’m sure he’ll understand. I wish you all the best!"

175889728,"My view is that persistent low grade symptoms just accumulate and grow into a bigger and bigger problem over a period of years as they get wired more and more deeply into the brain. The brain is a learning mechanism and, just as CBT can teach us to be healthier, so persistent symptoms can teach us to be sicker. You get more of what you focus on and I’d say get rid of as many of the symptoms as you reasonably can."

175889745,"PTSD arises not so much from the level of badness in an event, but from the amount of shock it causes to your worldview. I’m guessing that before this incident, you generally thought of your neighborhood as a fairly safe place where you could go about your day without fear. Or at least you didn’t think about the possibility of being attacked. Seeing such a thing happen to someone else really changed that view. You suddenly and without warning became acutely aware of the possibility of being attacked on your street. That sudden shift of viewing the world as a safe or neutral place to a place full of potential danger is what causes PTSD symptoms. Your brain is wired to respond to threats. It is very good at learning negative associations and responding to them. This is a skill that has kept us alive for thousands of years. Your brain learned that there were threats to respond to. Bad men can beat up women on this street. But it wasn’t so good at sorting out what was really a threat and what was 
just background data associated with the threat. It wasn’t good at telling when the threat has passed, and when it can return to its resting state. There are a lot more people with PTSD like yours, they just generally don’t realize they have PTSD because, like you, they believe they shouldn’t be so affected by something that happened to someone else. This is one of the factors that leads to people living in poverty to experience higher rates of mental illness. The trauma of living in a high-crime neighborhood is real, even if nothing bad ever happens to you personally. The normalization of witnessing violent crimes in such neighborhoods, combined with lack of access to affordable mental health care, leads people to not get help, and leads them to develop symptoms like yours."

174326677,Honestly it is probably a mix of both. Antidepressants may or may not help you. It sounds like you are depressed from your symptoms. In which case getting your psychosis under control is what is going to help you stop being depressed. Antidepressants will not make you happy if your life situation is bad; they allow you to feel happiness if your life situation is good if you can’t do so.

175889779,"sorry for my bad english and for wrong verbs, I don’t know well english. I am not a minor, I am not assuming anything because I have no schizophrenia. but when I was 15 until I was 16 “they” forced me to take various drugs including risperdal… I was sure that the psychiatrist was a very ambiguous person with great preferences and had bad intentions towards me. But at the time I did not correlate, I managed to escape from that witch in time by doing everything to assume nothing. over time I connected the dots, I am a person with excellent memory and good interpersonal skills so I think I am not wrong, I have no big bias, and my experience can confirms. I’m sure the psychiatrist chose risperdal in the end when she starts hating myself for killing my sexuality. I understood this after many years. there are unconscious mental phenomena such as dissonance and dissociation (and also others less predominant) that when you can perceive even a little of their effect on the world is impressive. Con
necting the dots at that point I started looking on the internet and found that even risperdal is seen as an extreme male anti-sex pill, the most invasive and worst. this confirms all my theories that she chose it on purpose (however here I never paid for drugs, and I guess here in Italy is normal for drugs for mental illness) and I also found many testimonies in my language and heree in these forum too, also of other drugs and of minors - young people but also adults. So I saw it right, and here I am, I have been thinking about it for a lot time and I cannot come to a conclusion. I hope at least that my genetics have not been modified and this sound hilarious but maybe this can. it seems improbably but I don’t know. However I am thinking about this so much (sometimes) and I can add more details that can be interesting if we do a sort of discussion and so on."

Anhedonia, avolition, apathy etc. This condition makes me suffer when I understand that I’m disabled and probably never normal. No medication helps. I also have cognitive and memory problems, no personality, spiritually dead. Can we make some sort of group or chat with people like us? I feel like this simple type schizophrenia/deficit syndrome is very rare."

And a few extra pages, e.g. a page long interview with his neighbour describing how confused he was and how scared they were (but didnt call the crisis line). Oh joy. THAT will make coming out so much easier again. They suspect he became depressed, and then psychotic because of antidepressants. I dislike that they write all these opinions of scared neighbours and classmates that knew him as a kid and no serious information about psychosis and how little of us actually do such things."

When you turn away from visual stimuli you are faced with your own life I feel. That can be scary, but also a way to maybe deal with things that are bottled up. I couldn’t bear total silence, but with listening to a radio it becomes just bearable as my mind has something to be occupied with. You could always go back to the tv if it becomes too hard to stay away. That’s my 5 cents. You might try it and see if it can help you"

I’m a bit more paranoid today and I’m raising my voice when I’m speaking to my dad. Also I was zoning out a bit while I was watching TV. Maybe my body is trying to adjust to the lower dose.

In the beginning I was also grocery shopping every two or three days. I did this for a long time. Now, after I smoked I go back to bed. But in the meantime when I’m smoking I’m on the internet. I really rarely go out for a walk. I can’t lay the whole day and night in bed anymore because of the urge to smoke. It’s not a good trade for my health. I can’t be just with myself, I get really exhausted and am nervous all the time if I don’t smoke, just being there is too much for me. That’s probably the reason why I started smoking, to get some kind of relief. But now am trapped into the addiction. Quitting smoking would mean being irritated, nervous and out of place.

I was manic and kept trying to escape, the police were forceful and handcuffed me, which now I look back was newcessary as I was behaving like a wild card. My fault, not theres. They did what they had to do and ultimately they’re dealing with something there not used too. They do what they can.

Some slaves were later inducted into the nobility based on their talents. So, yes, my ancestors probably owned slaves but they’re completely different from North American “slaves” since we didn’t get anyone from other countries to be enslaved. I have pride in my noble lineage and from a clan with an independence activist, but the Joseon Dynasty was a rough dynasty with rigid castes."

175889850,"Some hospitals are nicer than others. And some hospitals are not as safe as others. In my experience, what they all have in common is that they are boring. A lot of them have pool tables or ping-pong tables but you can only play so many games of pool until it’s not fun anymore. Some have groups or activities or informal classes. In my experience they really frown on sleeping in your room during the day but I usually do it anyways. In most of them if the nurses or staff aren’t busy you can talk to them and they are mostly friendly. I’ve always disliked being in any hospital but if I have to go in one, I will. Someone mentioned bringing someone with you; that’s a good idea for support and if you’re not a big talker your family member or friend can help you with checking in and expressing why you’re there. When you enter they will have someone who works there interview you to find out why you’re there. It’s not hard or difficult, they don’t know you so they just want to get a general 
idea of your mental state. Personally, I never go in a hospital until the last minute, until I’m at the end of my rope and I’m close to going off the deep end. I don’t mean I get violent, I mean I just always wait until there’s no other option. Lots of people though go in way before then, when they are still relatively lucid and in control and don’t wait until your mental state is in crisis. I think that’s a better idea to go in while you are still a little in control and just need a tune-up and a little rest and safety and time to get better so you can face the world again."

For example what are the benefits? Does this happen when your schizophrenia goes into remission or is it just a personal choice. I’m honestly just curious and hope my question comes out the right way."

175889946,"I’m diagnosed with psychosis and my whole life I have had trouble making friends. The reason for this has been unclear to me until a few family resources decided to be blunt with me; I come off ass creepy. There’s nothing particular, I am not the type to act out or be overly eccentric. Apparently, i just have a “serial killer vibe.” I don’t slouch, or dress in dark clothes. I’m curious as to if my mannerisms are a direct result of my psychosis? I thought I was rather self aware, and I knew I came off a bit weird, but not enough to repel almost everyone. When I confront people from my past to say hello they become very hostile and even mean but when I ask why directly they dodge the question. Now that I’m an adult my family seems comfortable explaining this to me, I suppose. Whatever the case, it’s taking a strong toll on my self esteem and I really need help in knowing I’m not alone. Thank you."
175889947,When I was up to age 7 or 8 I was very moving and already had sexual desires (don’t want to talk about it) and I used to see hallucinations at night that were shadow people like I saw people walking in the room or the most memorable was a hand throwing bats into the room behind a tv. Is it possible I had psychosis at this early age or just showed the onset of early sz?

Nothing huge, just small victories over your fears. Start small. I volunteer at an animal shelter. Being around dogs and cats is incredibly grounding. Theres few moments more comforting than a dog licking your face, honestly. I go walk in parks. I put myself out in the open. I FEEL the fear, and let it PASS. Youll realize that these are just people out here to walk like yourself. Wear sunglasses. Observe nature. I have found when it come to over coming paranoia, fears of persecution, and that general everyone wants to kill me vibe is best mediated with a grounding technique. Grounding yourself in the reality of your freedom from your persecution bc really its your brain persecuting you."

I have been going through too much the past few months what with changing jobs, not getting use to new medication, might have a new family member, and a bunch of other things! So, I started I Vega on April and from 30lbs weight gain and going through 2 different doctors that wouldn’t listen I am now seeing a doctor who is prescribing me geodon. I haven’t taken it in years and I never took it with food. I have been reading on here that not only does it absorb better but also lasts longer with food. I don’t know if that is applicable to me since my fat cells have increased substantially, but I just had a few food questions… Do any of you take geodon without food and it is still effective? Have any of you had to eat food with this medication at first then did not have to? I know 350 calories is the minimum you can invest with geodon but… Can it be purely fat content? Can it be purely sugar content? Do I need to eat a full course meal in 
the morning with this medication? I’m asking this because me gaining 30lbs more in just 3 months is too much for me. So… I’m also wondering if even IF I HAVE to eat a 1000 calorie meal with this medication, especially with how much fat I’ve gained, would I possibly gain more weight?"

And the first week I'll have to work 40 hours. All training. Idk what to do about it. I mean with that many hours and my disability. But I know it's only a one time thing. I didnt tell them I'm on disability but I feel like they know with all I've told them. Like about my job counselor and stuff like that. I've been so stressed. I thought I lost my Medicare card yesterday but I was so stressed I didnt even see it in my wallet. And we are thinking about moving. Our lease is up in November but we have to give them 60 day notice. Not completely sure what to do about the timing of all that. I've went through a lot of scenarios with my mom and sp. We found a townhome that's 1100 sq ft for 885/m. But theres only one available in sept. If we stayed here wed be paying almost the same amount for another year. And we live in a 580 sq ft. We didnt even bring 
all the furniture from both our rooms from our parents and it's still crowded. Any other townhome/duplex in this area will start at 1200 or 1300 and we cant afford that a month. And we need a bigger place. We cant afford a house right now. Theres houses for rent but they start at 1200 or more and most of them for rent say no pets. Etc lots of other things I havent mentioned with other scenarios. Next week I dont have anything to do or very little so itll be my last time to relax and get myself together before the rest of my life.

I told him that ""This isn't up for debate., your friend took the papers from your wife, ruffled through though them, and handed me half the documents I was suppose to get."" Next time I came to work his wife had depression on her face from me confronting him with just cause. He had no right to have my papers with my SS number on them.

175890049,"Found the following interesting excerpt on the internet. My own experience of paranoia can be succinctly described as using language games. Effectively, my paranoia consisted of the idea that everyone was playing language games and that the object that people were referring to for certain words was me. What I found was that my perception of how people conversed became reduced to the simple rules of a language game, and I was an unwilling participant in this game. The problem was that these games were not harmless communication but used as a way of persecuting me. One reason that I may have had the perception that this was happening was that at some point I began to feel that what people meant could not be accounted for in the usual sense. So I resorted to analyzing people’s conversations in terms of a language game. It is possible that my emotional fear of being singled out is what caused me to no longer understand things in their normal way. In any case, any word that could be taken as referring 
to me, even by oblique references, was interpreted that way. For example, mentioning “America” could be taken to mean “Am _NAME_,” ie, a coded reference to someone who thinks he’s a woman. I would then take that to mean that the group accepted that this referred to me, with people using gestures, nods, and smiles to confirm to each other that I was the intended reference."
175890050,"I saw terrifying things that I couldn’t tell anyone about because I was a Fundamentalist Christian. When I did tell, I was accused of being a witch and a Satan worshipper, and I underwent an exorcism. And I saw beautiful things that exist only in the spiritual realm… I lived in psychosis for many years. I’m older now and I see less than I used to. Even my companion angel, who was with me vibrantly for years, is only a shell and a shadow now. Part of it is good. I haven’t been on the floor sobbing, resisting directions to cut myself in awhile. Part of it is decidedly bad. I feel like a bird with clipped wings, sitting in the cage of every day life. There are things I never intended to get rid of."

I know how enticing the psychotic state can be, like you’re being let into a grand plan or something, but it’s just the stressed-out subconscious mind inventing too much meaning over small things that the vast majority of people wouldn’t think twice about. Getting confused, for the most part. Trust me, the universe is just as clueless as the next person over what your destiny is. That part is up to you to create!

174326751,"The researchers observed no association between PA (physical activity) and schizophrenia risk in any analyses. There was evidence of an association between self-reported moderate/vigorous PA and increased schizophrenia risk in a univariate analysis with and without correction for body mass index (BMI). A trend for overall activity was noted in a univariate analysis, but the association was no longer significant after BMI correction. Huh? I found the paper on sci hub and the researchers said: 1 Because positive symptoms usually drive the diagnosis of samples included in schizophrenia GWAS, we hypothesize that we are (1) missing the association of PA with the cognitive/negative symptom domain, and (2) capturing a factor closely related to intense physical exercise (perhaps stress-related or personality traits) that worsens the symptomatology of psychosis. I wouldn’t read too much into this. They would have a long way to go to show causality and it doesn’t seem like they think that is what is goin

She starts making rhythmic steady moaning noises designed to drive me crazy. The lady is in her sixties, no one is going to tell me she doesn’t k now exactly what she’s doing and deliberately does it. And earlier the other old lady manipulated me into losing power. Two minutes ago the guy upstairs who listens to my apartment has to walk out at 3:00 in the morning lording over his territory because he sensed my tired brain might actually have a little control. How can you deal with people like this? It’s impossible. But no. These guys aren’t doing anything. They haven’t been doing this off and on for two years. The whole past two years was all in my head and they’re nice folk who wouldn’t dream of driving a tired old man crazy. It’s like my middle sister told me, I’m a hundred percent wrong and n

When I stand in my living room listening, yes I’m making those noises up that are five feet away from me.

175890106,"I’ve been hearing a faint, high-pitched, slightly vibrating sound coming from about 1-2 ft away from my left ear. I’ve also heard this sound a few times in my dreams, and one time the sound continued even after I woke up. In another dream my schizophrenia made me believe that this sound was the cause of my “schizophrenia”. I have only heard it during night time, but I can’t remember for how long I’ve been hearing it. Could be a hallucination, but it would be one of the very few realistic auditory hallucinations I’ve ever heard (the only other I remember being a train horn; I heard it one day right after waking up, and before that I got an inserted thought that I’m going to hear a train horn; an inserted thought after that claimed that I caused the train driver to blow the horn, because I’m a god; there’s a railroad nearby, but that would be one heck of a coincidence, so I’m just assuming it was a hallucination; the only other option could be that I’m psychic). Then there’s 
another strange sound, which is also faint, but a bit louder, that seems to come from the apartment upstairs. I can best describe it as “alien”, or “out of this world” sound. It seems to have a similar “essence” to it as the previous sound I described. It’s a simple two-note sound which also has some vibrance to it, and I can’t think of anything that could cause such sound. It keeps repeating for a while, goes silent for a bit once in a while, and then continues. I’ve also heard this only during the night, and I remember hearing it even before I got this condition (at least a year before, probably more). Although it was a strange sound, I never payed much attention to it. But while being in the hospital my schizophrenia showed me a memory where I got angry at that sound for some reason, which is odd, because I rarely ever got angry. That memory could have been fake though (although it felt real). What followed was inserted thoughts that this sound could be originating from something that cau
sed my condition. The voices call it “the spiritualizer” (as in the object that put the “spirit” that now controls my body (my body seems to move by itself and acts strangely) in my head or soul). Later when I came home and read a note I had written (but can’t remember writing it) there was written, among other things, that: “Earlier I had written about some strange things that seemed to happen in the apartment upstairs, and I have had voices in my head since that time.” I have not found what I had “written earlier” and I don’t remember what happened that made me write such thing (because my memory has been wiped clean during the period my schizophrenia arrived). The only other related odd thing that has happened was that as I started pacing in my room on the day I came home from the hospital (I had to pace because of the torturous feeling: Has schizophrenia caused you pain or other physical/bodily torture? ), steps in the apartment above started following me (I heard the steps right above 
me), and the steps were loud, like stomping. It continued for a while, and the steps from the apartment above me always sounded right above where I was. Then I went to the other room to check if they would follow me there, and the steps indeed followed me there. I don’t know much about who lives in the apartment above me, other than that he’s a middle-aged man."

Would most of you currently living with this forum of clandestine tagging be aware of it's uncanny similarities to revenge porn, group gaslighting/hate campaigns, and in the most extreme periods actual Zersetzung. So, what I feel has helped me to address in detail the dark use of NLP or the intimidation tactics of street theatre/public mobbing. Or the hate campaigns need to use shaming culture to prop up any loosely based claims of defect in nature or character, I used to sum them up with one simple explanative quote,( That, if we are such monsters, then why all the secrecy!) Even with all what you can easily see and record upon your smartphone, 'voices' are the 
usual catalyst for what happens above or the first clear sign of remote. ( this is the term which I have placed all these experiences in) . when the 'voices' are at their most revengeful and hateful try studying them, would it be uncanny like a Twitter storm or have the defining qualities of being an unwanted form of harassment, or defamation of character of which comes at us with derogatory rhetoric aimed at triggering us, trauma bonding us so we can be secretly blackmailed by this thing, or ruin every attempt to repair our lives. Accepting the channeling and repetitive pile-up and mocking as I am already aware of the reprisals for doing this, don't have anything new to say to my harassers other than pointing out what may be the very real truth!, things have come to throw the so-called woodwork before and been proven to have been real abusive events I victims life. So, if any real TI or VH needs to ask a question with regards to anything that currently tortures them or attempts to humiliate, entrap, blackmai
l or trigger then to an emotional response. Then please be my guest. Here is the link and some extracts from the PDF. Trauma-based Programming can be defined as systematic and calculated torture that blocks the subject’s capacity for conscious processing. Trauma Programming employs suggestion, hypnosis, and/or classical and operant conditioning to implant thoughts, directives, and perceptions in the unconscious mind. The behaviors are implanted in trauma-induced dissociated identities (parts/alters) that force the subject to do, feel, think, or perceive things for the purposes of the programmer. The objective is for the subject to follow directives with no conscious awareness, including the execution of acts in clear violation of the subject’s moral principles, spiritual convictions, and volition. The primary factor for trauma-based programming is the ability to disassociate. Dissociation is used as a defense to protect a subject from overwhelming pain and trauma. It is a natural ability"

I have no copays, can afford life saving treatments and medicines, don’t pay for monthly prescriptions for schizophrenia or my doctor visits. There are other benefits that I have not utilized from it such as for pregnant mothers or people who need cellphones and transportation.

175890206,"Not really having voices today. Minor whispers only, but the voices are on my mind. Things they’ve said that I still need to work through. Just some of my musings: Remember, not everyone hates you, the voices just try to _USER_ID_ and corrupt your perception. Everything you say isn’t wrong, and bad. People aren’t harshly judging everything you say. It’s ok to talk. People do actually care about you, it isn’t all just one big lie. There is love in your life. You may screw up, but that shouldn’t change what’s in your heart. Always keep pushing forward to a happier healthier place. Never forget, you need to love yourself, and show yourself some kindness."

Anyway, I decided to leave the mental health system cause the doctors stopped helping me. I noticed I got treated like a criminal than someone with mental illness. Its too late for me, I wish I would have known stuff 30 years ago but there was no internet and very little was known about the brain. I resigned to my fate. I took my chances and lost as most sz do.

175890255,"Hi _PERSON_, I don't want this message to go unresponded to, because it sounds like you're in a bad place. I just wanted to say that I hear what you are saying. I'm seeing a psychologist regularly at the moment, but I was quite worried about it because at least one of the times I was suicidal it was because of talking to a psychologist. Do you mind if I ask what sort of therapy you are in? Different types can be very different experiences. Talk therapy made things much worse for me, but Acceptance and Commitment Therapy really helps. It has some mindfulness stuff that feels a bit new-age, but is strongly evidence based. It's certainly very good for creating distance from emotions. Not suppressing or getting rid of them, but acknowledging them and then getting on with more important stuff. If you trust the therapist, it's okay to tell them that the style isn't working for you, and to ask to try something else. It's also okay to change therapists, or to quit if it isn't helping. Whatever you decide, 
hang in there. I promise you that there is a future version of _PERSON_ who wishes they had a time machine so they could tell you that it will get back to being easier again. Probably that future _PERSON_ is still faking it, but they also enjoy the game for what it is. They know that they can pretend if they want, or be themself if they want, and both are okay."

Used to party. The 80’s was the “Golden Age of Porn” but I’ll skip the topic. It’s no use saying how miserable I was a lot of the time.

I drove around the southwestern US and stayed with friends, sometimes in my truck. Didn’t realize anything was wrong but started hearing voices and mumbling and alternate meanings to what people were saying. Fast forward to first semester and I saw the school pdoc, I didn’t know it at the time but he dxed me with schizophrenia. I went on to finish college in three years for a BA in psych (already had some credits completed), THEN I lost it and ended up in jail and in a psych ward after my gf of two years broke up with me. Funny, I saw her driving yesterday. Hope it hasn’t triggered me. But yeah, couple episodes later I’m here, alive, living with mom but with some money in the bank, getting ready to have a kid with a new(ish) girlfriend. I make music, paint, animate, exercise. Goals for next year? Shower and brush teeth 
more, ride bike, get my music practice in and post my stuff to Spotify et al, animate, get better at painting, do more gigs, take care of family, be happy. Maybe get part time work. Maybe. End of an era!"

I feel like he transformed my family into being workers for him so I can’t even trust my family. I feel like the devil knows I made up stuff before and so is taking advantage of the fact that I just think I’m mentally ill when I’m actually not. And that in the end I’ll go to hell and North Korea with plastic surgery. I just worry I’m in the small minority of people this is actually happening to. So no one will believe me. Just like celebrities have secrets that normal people won’t have access to. Same thing I think goes to me. Or maybe I’m not in the minority, it’s just people who have this aren’t dumb enough to chalk it off as mental illness–they actually do something about it. I’m worried in the end there will be a set up that will make it look like I killed my family so they can take me away. I’m worried no one can help me or believe

All the fighting spirit in the world can’t carry you across some lines or keep you on the side you want to be when the heat is on.

It’s not like I have anything against african americans, I just am by far the minority in jail. The problem was I had a psychotic break and started wandering in areas where inmates aren’t supposed to go, which is why the guard told me I could go to solitary. Once I got to a solitary cell, the voice in my head said it was president _PERSON_ coming to pardon me, and he couldn’t tell where I was unless I kept flushing the toilet so he could listen for it and find me by ear. So after I had flushed the toilet about eighty times, the guy in the cell next to me started yelling about it and I was eventually escorted to solitary confinement in a mental illness wing. You’d think they’d give me my meds in that wing but they only gave me 1 out of 5 of my meds (Seroquel), which wasn’t enough to keep me sane. For my 
last month they transferred me to a mental hospital where they put me back on my meds to prepare me for trial where the charges were ultimately dropped. It was great getting out, I appreciate every good meal I have now."

Maybe you are more than what is destined for him in life, maybe God wants to see you enjoy your later part of life happy without him. You have said you didn't enjoy those 36 years right, why don't you plan for the next 36. This is in your hands. You can make it better. Your children are going to appreciate the decision you took not to end your life. They are going to have kids, your grandkids.

174326821,"I take 10 milligrams of aripiprazole nightly. The medication works best for me in that I am not as sedated compared to other medications I have tried. While occasionally I do have symptoms, those are rare. Maybe once about every 6 weeks or so. I am no longer gaining weight while on this medication. The side effects seem to be much less debilitating than some I experienced with other treatment options. I hope that helps answer what makes it right for me. Is it perfect? No, I have reacted better to it than say, injection forms of medications. Perhaps the most difficult side effect would be weight gain, apart from gynecomastia which outright made me refuse to take medications in the beginning. With abilify, I don’t notice any further growth however my obesity has affected that aspect as well. Other difficult side effects have been muscle spasms or twitching. I still have a some restlessness in my right leg. Most of the time I feel the need to move it. The twitches were fairly bad, that was more prev
alent on Risperdal. I’d get twitches near my eyes and neck movement. It made me ashamed to go out as it was visually obvious something was wrong with me. I’ve dealt with feeling lethargic and sedated to having bouts of insomnia. Not the kind where after I wake up I find it difficult to sleep, but rather the kind where I find it difficult to sleep in the first place. (If that makes it easier for you to describe should you write about it. ) Haldol slowed my mind down tremendously. At first I was placed on a high dose. My acting psychiatrist at the time ended up reducing the amount he’d give me after about 4 weeks. I have to admit he was one of the better psychiatrists I have had attend me. I could elaborate on that further if you’d like. As for the side effects changing my priorities and goals, they sure did. I do believe it is almost self explanatory at this point though i’ll state it again, I became ashamed to be seen in public because of tremors, signs of gynecomastia, and obesity. That changed my 
goals from what they were before the illness became apparent. Early on, I had a job, went to college, was in a relationship, even played music in a locally successful trio. There were many friends I had, always something to do. I’d say I was a normal productive young adult before the illness. After the initial diagnosis, everything began to go downhill. First, I left the job as I was incredibly sedated the first 4 weeks. Literally, I was on the couch 20 hours a day possibly more, just laying there sleeping, even to the point of drooling. I recall some friends would visit and they’d have this sad look on their face, worried about what was becoming of me. They would try to be as kind and supportive as possible. Then, I returned to college with a doctor’s note. I was very behind. It led to me dropping out. The rest all slowly went down the drain too. After all that, my goals changed significantly. Instead of trying to improve myself, I was simply trying to become stable to the point where I felt I might be 
able to do at least one of those things. I do not take any prescriptions or over the counter medications for any health problems other than schizoaffective disorder. (Initially I was diagnosed with schizophrenia paranoia, which I feel is more accurate, my current psychiatrist has only ever really seen me stable for the most part.) Experiences with medications… Haldol I took for about 6 months or so, at this point I do not remember the dose except that my psychiatrist thought it was too high for me. It was in injection form. Proved to be much too sedating. One of the worst periods of my life. That can also be attributed to suffering from the illness in it’s early years. According to some articles i’ve read, the first 10 years are often the most difficult, to the point where sufferers are more likely to commit suicide in the first 10 years after initial diagnosis. Haldol does work for some people so I cannot outright say it is a bad treatment. If anything, it did take away many of the symptoms. Next came 
risperdal in a tablet that dissolved under the tongue. If I recall correctly, it was referred to as risperdal m-tab. At the time, I was incredibly paranoid. Having moved back in with my parents, they tried to give me a soda that contained the medication. That did not help my paranoia one bit. Of course they were worried and wanted to make sure I would take the treatment. By then I had become hesitant to take any medication for schizophrenia as I had reacted so negatively to haldol. Due to the paranoia, I opted for the injection form of risperdal. I remember stating to the psychiatrist that I’d rather take the injection so that way they knew they were “raping my soul”. (My apologies if that is triggering for some of my fellow sufferers.) I ended up only taking the tablet for maybe some 3 weeks or so. That one clearly did not help every symptom. Risperdal Consta (the injection form) however, did. Risperdal consta I would say was the third best medication for me. The main problem was gynecomastia and this 
burning sensation i’d feel coursing through my body after being injected. On that one I actually did have a bit of time in which I got out and started trying to play sports (soccer) again. I found it difficult to run for over 45 minutes like I did before. I still was able to, just felt slower, my reflexes were off. The first time I switched from that medication was because I moved to a city. It was an entirely different county about 300 to 350 miles away. I still live in this city. It was were I had lived before I moved in with my parents. I was only administered Thorazine twice or so during my first episode of psychosis before I was formally diagnosed. I had an allergic reaction to it. It numbs my tongue and I cannot speak clearly. The feeling was horrible and being my first experience with psychiatry, it did not help my willingness to seek treatment. Now whenever i’m asked what medications i’m allergic to, I have to be sure to mention thorazine. Prolixin was next, on that one, I was okay. Not so bad, 
not great, just okay. I must have been on prolixin for possibly 9 months or so. Gynecomastia became a bit of a problem. The main reason why I got off it was because prolixin left me twitchy. Luckily, it did not become permanent. I also still experienced some amounts of psychosis meaning I was out of touch with reality. Keep that in mind when you become a big shot. Psychosis doesn’t always mean becoming angry or physically violent. I’m getting a little sleepy right now. I have to apologize for being a little later than I mentioned. My laptop delivery was rescheduled. It arrived today and that made typing this out far easier. I will continue tomorrow with the other medications I’ve taken and any further questions or details you’d like me to share. Hopefully that helps you."

174326836,"Information: Please do not treat this post as trolling or something which needs to be closed. I have something which looks like wrong beliefs for long time. I may just believe that people do not have brains, lungs, kidneys, liver, heart, hemoglobin, trace elements in their bodies. I had similar thoughts even about 12 - 15 years earlier (when I was about 12 - 15) and they were associated with my body (that I have not head, face (?), buttocks, do not have microelements like manganese and molybdenum in my body). My “mentality” may be pretty convinced (fully convinced) that women (especially with _PERSON_’s) have “angel-like” bodies without organs, metals and physiological needs . I also may thinks that the same attributes are shared by Germans, schizophrenics, people with certain haplogroups etc. Defecation and flatulence are something really humilitating according to my “nature”. I want the situation in which nobody needs to expel feces or flatus from one’s own body. I may truly belie
ve that many people in the world never pooped or tooted and will never do it. I may think that “ I can’t have mental illness or autism because I poop ”. I am poor creature who defecates and flatulates. I was diagnosed with schizotypal disorder and Asperger’s and OCD instead of schizophrenia. I may think that I can’t have them because I needed to go to the toilet many times. Even when aspijkas (female Aspies) would have intestines and urge to defecate, they souls are not defecating and the soul is immortal, not temporal body. But I may think that even temporal body of so interesting created person like aspijka does not have ugly intestines and do not produce malodorous substances because it would be abominable, disgusting, very humilitating. I have obvious urge to marry a woman with mental disabilities similar to mine and lack of such a wife might have very bad, destructing influence on my functioning and mental well-being. I am about 28 years old now and still have no candidate to marriage. If I wou

effect?

They’ve pointed out flaws in the plans I had for future before schizophrenia hit me fully, and came to many more ideas regarding those plans. They have also reminded me things that I’ve done wrong/badly in my life, and how I could have done better. I’m saying the fake thoughts are smarter than me, because the things they brought up never occurred to me back when I was thinking about and/or doing these particular things. How can they be smarter than me? Where does this more advanced intelligence that produces those fake thoughts come from? Also, it seems the fake thoughts are produced by the same thing that controls the voice. Sometimes the voice says in a sentence something like “… things like this.”, and then a fake thought comes to say what that “this” is. That means there is 1 thing that controls all of these: the voice, fake thoughts, my body, and dreams."

I try to avoid them and stay away from haters. My stepdad I had was abusive and others too. I was hated and bullied as a teenager in Onsala and that hurt.i didn’t get much love but daily hate and nasty words. Today I would rather be alone than around people who treat me that way but back then I put up with it because I loved the girls but they were not always nice and they hung out with the boys that hated on me. When I had voices every one was probably my enemy and I was a experiment etc Was painful agonising. I don’t hate anyone. There are some people I’m not keen on and avoid.

175890568,"The question is not related the similarities between the schizophrenia and any other condition ,but rather related what is the schizophrenia ? Everything related the creation cause (structure /function) who establishing the sz condition inside the human nature in youth age /top of autoimmunity and makes it still for unknown time And is also introduces the bad side effects which classified as positive,negative and cognitive symptoms The genetic treatment with drugs is a possible way to treatment the bad side effects of the symptoms to some degrees, but all treatments cannot target the bad functional cause itself and then cannot achieve the final recovery from the sz condition,therefore the genetic is a method of treatment not a cause of sz ! In other words,all anatomical and chemical changes that can be observed in a person with sz ARE not the creation cause of sz or the functional cause of its symptoms but they are also a results (bad side effects ) like the mental and behavior symptoms- Yes like w

175890616,the one thing that might get me. is most celebrities are attractive and i might do a doubletake checking them out. it’s a bad habit of mine admiring beauty but im not as bad at that anymore. i notice attractive men and women.
175890617,I’m sorry to hear that. It doesn’t feel good to get out of the home once in awhile and visit your mom?

175890626,"_AT_MENTION_ Well, I actually was able to lose weight on it, but I had to eat like 1200 calories a day to see any weight loss. I’m not sure if counting calories/macronutrients is something you would consider, but it can be a massive help in knowing how much the invega is affecting you, in terms of metabolism slow down, and accomplishing your weight loss goals. After I stopped invega, I was able to recover my strength in the gym and I was able to rebuild the muscle mass I had before. After stopping the invega, I didnt need to consume only 1200 calories anymore, and was able to eat a bit more and still lose weight. I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but if you once were fit and had muscle mass and then stopped working out for a while, rebuilding that lost muscle will be a lot easier than if you had to start from zero. Like you, I couldn’t workout while taking invega. I think trying the latuda will be a good move for you! What other antiosychotics have you tried, if I may ask, and how did y
ou do on them?"

174326893,"I believe all of us, schizophrenics.. (Or people with schizophrenia?). We aren't defined by our altered state of consciousness. But what is consciousness? Job could define it a little for you.. It is a philosophical thing.. But it's also everything; ""Consciousness refers to your individual awareness of your unique thoughts, memories, feelings, sensations, and environment. Your consciousness is your awareness of yourself and the world around you. This awareness is subjective and unique to you. Your conscious experiences are constantly shifting and changing."" What did psychedelics do to me? Think of my brain as a snow globe when I was a kid.. It was constantly being shaken.. There was snow everywhere in my mind.. Creative, genius energy.. Innocent - No construct of the world. Just playing, having fun. I witnessed something horrifying when I was 12 (My dad crying in the living room. My mom, little sister and my dad was there with me. My mom said ""I love him - Referring to my ex step dad"" and I jus
t burst out crying immediately.. I didn't even notice the torn up kitchen with glass and blood everywhere - things gone through the window.. Until I was picking up the pieces with my brother and sister..). Whoever was shaking that snow globe, stopped shaking it that day. I started to stop losing touch with reality and became fully logical, atheist, nihilistic, introverted, withdrawn, scared, depressed, apathetic, severely socially anhedonic and avoidant. I became schizoid. Then at age 16, the snow globe was so still, dark and cold for so long and people were screaming at the snow globe to shake - But no one could shake it. - It's like at the end of the universe (I believe the Big Bang was a shake of the universe snow globe.. It's still full of life but it will soon be dark, empty and cold.. Until it becomes nothing.. Someone has to shake it again..). When people are screaming at you to do something and you don't want to do it - All the expectations, pressure, shame for not dancing to the beat of life - Your w
hole world and identity breaks apart - The day I said ""My dad pays for the food"" (To my ex step dad). He gaslighted me so hard but couldn't control himself either - ""Who was this man?"", I thought to myself.. ""Does he really think that I like him? Why am I pretending to like him?"".. So I hated him.. He then would gaslight me in front of the family and say ""Hi"" because he knew I wouldn't say ""Hi"" back.. Made the whole family feel sorry for him.. I was lost in depression and wasting time being depressed, doing nothing.. Now I wasn't autistically disconnected from reality as a kid, but I was schizophrenically losing touch with it as a teenager.. Then one night I took a high dose of psychedelic - Higher than for an experienced normal person, let alone for someone with schizophrenia.. The night made me reflect on myself to come in contact with my soul - Dissolved my ego that was protecting myself, made me question everything and then I died.. I hallucinated that my pulse stopped.. Now I'm constantly check
ing my pulse but have a new appreciation for life, see the magic and the fake snow in the snow globe will be trickling down for maybe the next 10-12 years. A whole new decade. Everyone has their own experience and what makes them break down and their mistakes. It doesn't always take psychedelics to shake the snow globe - But they help. (I wouldn't advise someone with schizophrenia to try tho unless they have a good sense of reality from also a little autism)."

I decided after decade+ of individual counseling & medication for depression & anxiety if I did not go to a psychiatric unit I would not survive. I was there for insomnia as well as passive suicidal ideation & my spouse at the time suggestion murder suicide to solve our problems. I was inpatient 10 days before they found a good prescription regime so I could sleep & function, I ended up telling my mother-in-law about the threats & she removed the guns. I began plotting my escape & moved out of state in with my mom. Did that fix the situation completely? No but I was safe, could sleep, found a new job, & started over that was 6/13/2009. I have found I am surviving & can live one day at a time. But it has taken quite some time & Rx changes. & change in diagnosis. I know if I can get through what I have gone through you can too!"

Does anyone else get Facebook friend request constantly throughout the day? I don't remember when it started but I'm getting like 4 or 5 friend requests a day. All from men, so I've just ignored them. I wish it would stop. So my rls is too soon to see if the benzo helped. Benzos always help RLS. I'm hungry. Supper was about 3 tablespoons of seasoned meat and a small serving of salsa and sour cream. No tortilla.The food here is pretty bad lately, maybe they're over budget and can't afford food until November. Craving a cheeseburger. Now that I can have cheese I guess it increases the odds of getting something I'll like."

175890640,"Do the things you have control over. When you’re working there’s a lot you can’t control. But you have control over being on time, your appearance (being clean, dressed appropriately in clean, wrinkle free clothes, being well groomed; including cutting your fingernails, a nice, neat haircut, shaved). Having punctuality problems is what every employer hates and you don’t want that reputation of being someone who is consistently late. All these are easy, common sense things to do. Having a good attitude every day at work will get you far. I’ve worked with so many people who have a poor attitude at work and believe me, the boss will notice. I don’t want to stereotype but it seems to be at some of the jobs I’ve been employed at, it seems that the younger people seem to be the ones who bit*h and moan the most. Not all the time, just sometimes. I’ve been on a crew unloading trucks and some guys will announce so everybody hears, “I hate being here, I wish I was home.” They were serious 
and the boss was like ten feet away. So the bosses reaction was to call us all together for a meeting and tells everybody, “If you don’t want to be here, then leave. But don’t come back because you will not have a job here” lol. But yeah, my father taught me that a good attitude is a big part of working. Do what your boss tells you without complaining or rolling your eyes. When he tells you to do something, look enthusiastic and get right to it and do your best. Don’t look bugged or mad. Just do your best. When you’re new at a job, there is a learning curve. The boss expects you do a prompt, good job but he understands that since you are new you are going to make a few mistakes and he knows you won’t learn everything the first day or even the first week. But he will notice if you put a lot of effort into it and there’s nothing wrong with getting on the good side of a boss or supervisor. And try to have a little fun. You’re getting paid for a reason, because you are expected to pull your own 
weight. But all jobs aren’t like 8 hours of solid, grim, monotonous, backbreaking work. Employees are allowed to talk and laugh and even stand and rest for a couple of minutes occasionally. as long as you don’t do these things too much. This may be a lot of information but like I said, it’s mostly common sense and if you start doing these things right off, it will become a habit and you will do these things naturally without thinking twice. Good luck on your new job!"
175890641,Its not normal to be paranoid and have delusions and make threats which is an assault. Most people go through life without that. That defines normality.

175890687,"This is what I propose to email to the complaints department for the mental health team in my location: To PALs I am writing to complain about the indirect forced treatment of myself by the Partnership NHS Trust. I do not have the power to discharge myself from services – despite multiple attempts When I tried to cancel an appointment with the psychiatrist more than 2 weeks in advance, I was informed by the secretary that the appointment was re-allocated to someone in need. When the Psychiatrist called me for the review, understandably I lost my temper, and this resulted in a review letter questioning my sanity. In the past I have continuously tried to cancel appointments with the same result as the above It took the trust 16 years to realise I have Autism, only then to be told by the Psychologist that her techniques wouldn’t be able to help me anyway, and those sessions ended when she retired, rather than by clinical need. I was told simply it would ‘inform’ her treatment for me – not de
cide whether it was going to end or not. Now the trust tells me after treatment with Pregabalin that I have GAD. How can these things be going unnoticed for so many years? I am now dependent on Diazepam, and cannot function without it due to dependency on the specialists intervention with my GP. My GP is refusing to add a specialists requested medication to my repeat – so that isn’t even working anymore. I cannot raise my concerns with my care coordinator, as I feel I am not being listened too. I deny all of my mental illness labels, as the trust is not capable of treating someone with dignity so how can they correctly assess if someone is ill? My life is not my own. I should be able to choose if I want to live, and that should not be dictated to by other people through concern who I like to call ‘helpful idiots’. I feel trapped by the doctors power over my drivers license, as I need to drive for work, and this has also caused great pain in the past when it was rejected for two years and I had to comm
ute a 70 mile round trip at great personal expense. I also cannot claim benefits without support from the trust, so that’s another soft power being used to keep me in line. As a result of the above, you either get my treatment cancelled with immediate effect, or get the law involved. The result of your actions will bring some clarity to the situation I am currently in. Will they listen to me?"

The panel meeting was set for two months away so I had to sweat it out for two months thinking about jail and fines. But a few weeks before the meeting a woman called and she said they didn’t want to go to all the trouble to prosecute me and she kind of half-believed my story and so they dropped the case. I didn’t deliberately try to defraud them, it just started off as an innocent lie. In fact in the initial interview. I told human resources that I didn’t want any money and I didn’t want to file for workman’s comp, but they said I had to. I had hurt my back and my mom (who was usu

174326920,Do you get anxiety attacks? They are hard to explain I just know what it feels like. It feels like your bones are on fire. Benzos make it go away. I take the lowest dose of Xanax you can take and only one a day and that does me fine. My wife has social anxiety and takes twice my dose up to 3 times a day so I guess mine ain’t so bad. I hate schizophrenia. I got through 38 years of my life without even knowing what anxiety was. Now I have it every day. Good luck with the supplements. Maybe that will work. I can’t take any of that stuff. I have tried it all.

If COVID-19 behaves like the Hong Kong flu, we can't run away. It'll find us. We'll not get it, get it and live, or get it and die. It was something that swept the population and naturally died out. Might all flus behave like that? Inescapable, like _PERSON_ Red Death? If so, I wonder whether the best thing regarding pandemics might not be to simply get them over with, with people acquiring immunity? At any rate, we're being studied. Bet on that."

175890816,"I was delusional for about 3 years straight. I thought that entities were reading my mind, first it was real living people then I thought it was the people in my dreams. The delusion was reinforced by the dream entities playing out thoughts that I tried to block. At one point I thought it was demons and tried to kill myself, they barked orders. I was miserable and just didn’t know what to do. Went to the hspital several times. I also hallucinated my delusions which made it terrifying. Now that I’m better I feel something of a hole in my chest because I was delusional soo long. I’m finally starting my life over. One thing that helped was just realizing that all cospiracies I had read about were likely untrue and unimportant and that there are no entities watching me. There’s nothing out there we are alone whatever life exists is too far away and that gods are made up. That last one was hard because when I was psychotic I used to pray every night and even feel entities around me, but that was 
my imagination. Anyway, the thought of God made me more paranoid, just reinforcing that entities could read my thoughts."

I’m posting this here because I recall that both glycine and N-acetylcysteine have been trialed in schizophrenia. Would be great if this small pilot study is later replicated in a larger study. I would like to caution readers, because too often pilot studies were later refuted by larger studies. But it’s good that at least there’s some active reasearch."

174326955,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Aberrant glycosylation in schizophrenia: a review of 25 years of post-mortem brain studies. SE _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Molecular psychiatry, May 2020 13 Glycosylation, the enzymatic attachment of carbohydrates to proteins and lipids, regulates nearly all cellular processes and is critical in the development and function of the nervous system. Axon pathfinding, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission, and many other neuronal processes are regulated by glycans. Over the past 25 years, studies analyzing post-mortem brain samples have found evidence of aberrant glycosylation in individuals with schizophrenia. Proteins involved in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission display altered glycans in the disease state, including AMPA and kainate receptor subunits, glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2, and the GABAA receptor. Polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) and perineuronal nets, highly glycosylated molecules critical for axonal migration and 
synaptic stabilization, are both downregulated in multiple brain regions of individuals with schizophrenia. In addition, enzymes spanning several pathways of glycan synthesis show differential expression in brains of individuals with schizophrenia. These changes may be due to genetic predisposition, environmental perturbations, medication use, or a combination of these factors. However, the recent association of several enzymes of glycosylation with schizophrenia by genome-wide association studies underscores the importance of glycosylation in this disease. Understanding how glycosylation is dysregulated in the brain will further our understanding of how this pathway contributes to the development and pathophysiology of schizophrenia."

175890984,"I vaguely remember having this a few times long ago, in my teens or early adulthood. But nothing in the Iast 10 years. I'm not an expert but I cannot imagine one single traumatic event to be the cause of a personality disorder because personality is not formed in one single moment. I believe PD's are formed through repeated trauma, and birth trauma could be part of that. Apparently I was a crying baby (baby that cries a lot for no apparent reason, I don't know if it is the correct term in English). I do not believe a baby would cry for no reason, so I figured birth trauma or prenatal trauma could have been the reason. But it could just as easily been something simple like formula milk that wasn't good for me (because it was mentioned that it stopped around when I started solid foods)"

174326997,Lol it made my laugh because my recent thread is named Should I switch to a weaker AP? I think you shouldn’t switch to a stronger antipsychotic if your positive symptoms aren’t serious as you will likely get more negative symptoms. Are you on Geodon? I find that Risperdal is too sedating for me and causing severe negative symptoms. I want to try Geodon. I have an apt 24 Jan.
175890998,"I see. Well, I guess all we can do is leave it to the doctors to figure out. As for the question of the thread, I think I answered it. I’d be scared to have _PERSON_ if I didnt already have it. It’s a nasty thing to get."
175890999,"While I understand the sentiment, you were feeling psychotic not too long ago if I remember correctly so you probably need an atypical AP at minimum....we all wish we were off meds but if you have a full psychosis it can do things like take away reading ability etc. something like 80% of people relapse after AP withdrawal so the odds aren’t good."
174326982,"I think it’s become kinda a “way of life”. Which can be a bad thing too. But it’s also a good thing. Because without the label of schizophrenia we’d just be suffering mindlessly aimlessly not knowing why. We almost have a sz subculture on this board. I think the internet has given POTENTIAL power to schizophrenics. We haven’t been able to implement it totally yet but it’s brewing. We’re spreading sz memes, wisdom, or information. Sharing it with one another. We as a whole can rise above this. Yes there are individuals who do great things. But individuals who represent the group… By collaborating on our mental illness we are more group minded. Rather than 100 years ago every mentally ill person was really fighting very much alone. I don’t think this disease has helped me to date. I would be way more accomplished at 29 without the disease. Way more fulfilled. But in a way, there is a CHANCE, that at 50 years old, I will feel MORE accomplished due to mental illness. It’s opened a 
new world for me. It just took like 15 years with an illness to learn how to adjust to this world. But in the long run I’m still very capable. Maybe more capable now. Due to more stimuli in my life. Did I answer your questions or just go on some tangent. Idk. But I hope some good was said."

175891006,"Wow soccer dangerous? I thought that was one of the least dangerous sports. All I remember when I played as a kid was sometimes we’d accidentally kick each other in the shins, but they have shinguards for that. I think any sport is great. I kind of think “reading is better than anything else you could do” is a myth propagated by teachers of the older generations (baby boomers and before) mostly because when they were children there was only one TV in the house and video games didn’t exist. These days lots of kids spend a lot of screen time, it’s hard to limit it I bet. I wouldn’t know, I’m not a parent. I went to school for English, took plenty of lit classes, my vocabulary is top notch and I type 300 wpm with few if any grammatical errors. I always use the right form of “its” or “it’s” and I never add unnecessary apostrophes or spell “lose” with an extra o. At this point I don’t think there’s anything I could improve on simply by reading books, unless they were educ
ational textbooks. A lot of people do social media, I never do that, this site is the closest I get to social media. I might try to start a facebook page soon."

174327002,"I can’t think of anything positive. I would say that I have a creative edge because of it, But who’s to say that’s because of the schizophrenia, I could just be really creative. Its given me a platform as a writer, But I’d give that up to not suffer the way I do."
175891087,Looks good! I organized and cleaned mine a year ago. I need to do it again
175891088,"Don’t take L-Dopa, its pure dopamine and will surely cause psychosis or worsen your sz."
175891089,"During the last days I had an exacerbation of intrusive thoughts. It has been very difficult. I also make some progress as I find additional protective measures against intrusive thoughts, add healthy things to my diet, and study Chinese characters."
175891090,"its should i been reading books about it, theres alot studies shown that it best way to burn fat in short amount of time, remember keep it intense. Keep the heart beat pumping"
175891091,Sorry to hear that. That’s very unsettling. I’ve had something similar in a bloody underground man. But it also went wen I left the underground. But I asked the underground man if he could smell fire smoke and he was like… No.
175891092,Idk if anyone else seen my post or any of my posts here the past few days but I was lowering my phenibut by 100mg a day and my last post was incredibly dysphoric. I deleted it because it was soooo negative as hell. There was no hope in that state. Suicidal and everything. Lasted 7 days. But now it's ok I took 500mg. My mom got drunk cuz she's stressed but everything is ok I love my mom. My phenibut taper posts was why I said those things. This is my natural state. Feeling good and rational. I forget what else I was gonna say..
174327007,"They do cause and or worsen negative symptoms. Dopamine is central to the reward system and motivation, block 90% of receptors and the outcome is obvious. I thought I sometimes lacked motivation, I didn’t know the true meaning of lacking motivation until antipsychotics, nor the complete apathy that ensued."
175891093,"I’m on xeplion 75mg and when I was injected at first with 150mg and five days later with 125mg I think that is too much and after 3 months it’s sedating me too much, I sleep for 20hrs a day. I wanted to ask when the sedation ends and when the initial doses will fade away? I also started lexapro 10mg I’m on 4th day on it, I heard ssri keeps you awake, is this true?"
175891094,Nope not today. I will tomorrow though.
174327003,I was never an alcoholic but I drank often and to get drunk. And when I got drunk I chased women and I usually caught one. I am married so that made me paranoid. I was already paranoid enough so I quit drinking in 2009. I have been sober for more than 10 years and I don’t regret it but now I have no social life. If you have schizophrenia you don’t need an addiction on top of it. Best of luck and congratulations.
175891095,_AT_MENTION_ you know alcohol talk is recovery only.
175891096,So I read atomic habits and it was great but I never implemented it at all....but I do recommend it if you have any motivation left.

174327004,is it consistent with the vulnerability stress model (or diathesis stress model) that stress during adolescence could trigger schizophrenia symptoms many years later in the early adulthood or the model posits that schizophrenia symptoms occur close to stressful life events?
175891099,"I live in the country outside a small city. When I moved here it was just a village, but has grown alot since then. I only have 4 neighbors and it’s pretty quiet. I couldn’t handle a big city, too much noise and overstimulation of the senses. I prefer small town living."
175891100,I shop on eBay. I usually like to buy cosmetic products there but I prefer to get clothes at the clothes stores or on clothing apps and websites (more trustworthy). I prefer to customize my hoodies too. I also like to get great quality custom made/designed apparel at great prices.

Could also be as simple as a dosing issue or a seperate problem. best of luck"
175891103,"less noise pollution as well but idk if that a good thing or not, if you cant hear it how will you know whats coming around the corner say, chargers are quite common around here, we are a small country so easier to equip, i asked my local mp if they could fit a charger near me and they did so i have one near my flat, the electric motorbike has a removable battery so i can take it upstairs and charge it from my home (if i got one)"

Back in April when I was doing poorly I started drinking and smoking pot (it’s legal in _USER_ID_) but made myself throw out all the liquor after I woke up on the bathroom floor without knowing how I got there. Maybe getting rid of all the alcohol in the house would work to help you cut back, too. Feeling out of control is so scary, I hope you feel better soon…"
175891106,"Walked to the pharmacy and picked up my meds, plus a dark chocolate bar (90% cocoa)."

175891111,"Damn, that sucks. Have you looked into this lion’s mane stuff people are talking about? Do you think your doctor might be open to stuff like that?"
175891112,I used to wake the cat up - i fart so loud in bed. Especially when ive drunk a couple of pints of milk to get rid of acid reflux. _PERSON_ disgusted meows were hilarious. I swear im slightly intolarant to the stuff.
175891113,yeah i will go see a doctor when the ppl here take me seriously
175891114,Are you on meds now ?
175891115,"Well it’s better this way. I was a danger to myself and others for a long time, and I internalised everything until just a few years ago, as I hid my illness for a long time, as I didn’t want to get locked up. You sound like you have caught it at a good time before it gets too out of hand. Wish they did that here, but mental health services in my area are only reactive with acute cases, so you have to get really bad before anyone seems to do anything about it unfortunately"
175891116,"It’s crazy how an ex can still be so invested into the well being of your life. Truly, it’s a blessing. They are deserving of the truest friendship one can offer. I’m glad you have this person, and I hope that this improvement helps you out!"
175891117,"If you?re willing to pay for that, sure? But I really don?t think that?s worth taxpayer money. I do agree that everyone should work out, but if you?re only able to work out with a PT then that?s an incredibly expensive way to stay in shape. Also, regarding the OP, I think exercise is very important for overall health but I don?t think it?s been one of the most important factors in my recovery."
175891118,"Congratulations. Its a real breakthrew. Because i have tenetis i only manage a beeping sound. But sometimes total silence. It is an odd feeling, but a positive one.

175891119,What is it exactly about grad school that you miss?
175891120,No med changes. See him in a month for reevaluation. I can see him sooner if needed. Hopefully I keep improving with the zoloft.

175891126,Progressive but good. I think it’s a combination of age and being on a regime for a long time. I have way less paranoia and depression and I don’t do too badly. I do live a low stressed lifestyle too which does help…so progressively to the better for me.

Find something that makes you proud or happy, replace that emotion. Force yourself to feel something other than the sadness. Be your own cheerleader and build yourself up. Understand that when you are sad, getting out of bed is a fucking success. You're doing amazing."
175891138,"New here, first post. To start it off, I am the son of Lucifer. At least that’s what he has told me. I’ve been told it is a delusion. But it feels way to real. He’s shown me things that prove this is not my reality. Everything is slightly different. Other little delusions hit me randomly. Like cameras in the house, cops after me, etc. But I’m always the son of lucifer no matter what. I was unmedicated for 3 years with no therapy. I’m in therapy and on meds too. Hallucinations are shadows either moving very quickly or just stay in one place. I’ve heard chanting and voices of loved ones."
175891139,I don’t see any harm in getting her something little. Maybe some candies? I think it would be nice and she’d appreciate it.

175891143,So you have catatonic sz?
175891144,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ They were so good
175891145,I’m an atheist and still when I was very ill I had religious themed delusions. When I got better they went away. Religious delusions are just the same as any other delusion. Treated with meds. So switch meds or increase the dose of your existing meds if they’re bothering you. I still have unusual beliefs about the occult though. But they don’t bother me.
175891146,GL with this interview.
175891147,What dose of risperidone are you on?
175891148,Anyone got other suggestions? Thanks _AT_MENTION_

174327025,Amitriptyline has urine retention as a side effect
175891156,Hi _NAME_! So day 1 after taking the pill I felt less anxious and completely lazy with no energy. I have nausea and no appetite but I try to force myself to eat as I’m already a petite person and I cannot afford to lose weight. Last night was not a good one. Even though I was so tired I could not sleep. The moment I would close my eyes I could feel the heart palpitations and shakes. I considered taking clonazepam but I didn’t and eventually by 1a.m. I fell asleep and now awake at 6a.m. From my previous experiences with lex I do remember not being able to sleep through the first night. I think maybe I will try taking the pill in the afternoon instead of the morning so I don’t feel so blahhhh all day. I have kids and it’s hard to try and do things for them while feeling like a zombie ???
175891157,What made you change your mind?
175891158,"Have to read things three times to get it. A book, huh haha…nope. I miss a lot in shows and movies. Has to be an easy watch. Concentration and attention stinks for me"
174327014,"Thought I already replied… I tried 4, Zyprexa, Abilify, Latuda and Risperdal. Switched between them many times. I am now on Risperdal, hopefully no more switching."

175891160,"I used to get accused of being a tease or a flirt all the time back when I looked like a woman. Since I was age 12, which is just gross to think about. Now that I look like a boy, nobody ever accuses me of that, even though I act exactly the same."
175891161,"I consider myself sane. I just hallucinate every now and then, no delusions. If I was still insane, my family wouldn’t be able to live with me."
174327018,"Alot of inpatient Drs have diagnosed me with schizoaffective but never explained it to me. When im trying to sleep my thoughts are like salad popcorning all over and the thoughts get “loud” i begin to twitch and have anxiety. It will be like this: the cat pink stood NMS your gonna die perfect sunlight today"". These thoughts and images/ videos are very disturbing of nature. Anyone relate? Please elaborate:^)"
175891162,Thanks. I admit it covid is starting to wear me down.
175891163,Or psychoanalysis? For psychosis. How expensive were they for you?
175891164,I’m jealous......
175891165,"I have an appointment with the assistant manager Monday morning to do paperwork for the next available apartment. I’m so excited. It could be really soon that I finally get to unpack. All my stuff has been in boxes so long I don’t even remember what I own. It will be good to have my stuff. It will be great to have my own bathroom, omg. It will be great to have my own refrigerator and kitchen. I can’t wait."
175891166,"Yeah I still am positive symptom free. I really have no answer for why it has all gone away other than I did a lot of rtms treatments (that stabilized my mood), but that wasn’t for psychosis or anything. I guess just over the years it lessened for me. regardless I am happy how things are going. Hope your doing well _NAME_ A turtle bolts for the nearest exit"
174327020,Or they could have given it. A number like MD 1 for voices MD 2 for fear MD 3 for etc.
175891167,"Oh, ok, it sucks… Also, _AT_MENTION_, did someone in his illness knew this withdrawal of his/her emotions? Some stronger and more positive emotions hit me today tbh for the first time since decades and i realized, that the most of my suffering is probably on this level - the emotional level… I feel some emotions, but they are deep down in me, quite buried and i guess mostly painful and negative… I often feel empty on the level of my chest, where the emotions are supposed to be. Can i recover on my emotions too one day if i am patient as till now? I need them really strong and positive lol… The withdrawal of emotions is a negative symptom in fact? Tbh, ive felt for long time as a psycho to have so weak and sick emotions, but now i try to pardon myself this. I’ve paid it all too in a way…"
175891168,****ing amazing!
175891169,"I also changed my diet! To be honest Ketogenic diet was one of the best diets that helped with my paranoia But only helped for short term… I should of included tons more veggies while doing it… I think I overate meat and because of that , I would continuously would get out of ketosis. Perhaps a mixture of all of these would be effective But it just got too strict and too much…"
175891170,"Maybe it’s placebo yet,I am only two weeks taking it…no side effect yet"
175891171,Why are references to spirituality or God constantly flagged? Are we children who must be protected from anyone expressing a belief in God or spirituality?

175891176,"I always suffered from anxiety. What helped me was facing my fears and not letting it control me, when fear isn’t faced it grows just as fast as you mask it. Now I have it and think why am I feeling this way? I start to question it and ask myself is this worth being anxious for? If I were you I’d try to cut down AP’s that are for anxiety but not too much that your symptoms get too high, but just enough for you to function and wonder on life’s mysteries. To live is to feel everything the bad and the good. I do it with help of low doses of anxiety medicine like vistaril and gabapentin. But for the most part I face it."
175891177,Curious if knowing that words have meaning only if you allow them to helps anyone feel a sense of peace inside the screams! Or how each hallucination is digging deep in to discovering parts of yourself that are yearning to heal… and it’s only you and your heart… that are able to take control… there is a book that mentions our whole mind… our whole perception as a “miscreation” … we are living in a false reality behind our eyes until we lay our eyes on the outside! And then… is it really just a reflection? And to think we can only perceive as much as we know… as much as we dream… and even then. The most extreme should only ever be reality
175891178,I bet you did awesome!
174327017,im using minocycline for one month it is help me very little but when i dont take i become much worse. dae using minocycline how is your experience

175891181,A little bit more so when its wearing off or when have intrusive thoughts. I just wish I could be normal and not be so affected by bad things. Yeah it probably is like once we got robbed and I couldnt stop thinking about it like maybe it was my fault.

175891185,Be careful if you go this route. _PERSON_ can cause psychosis and mania if you use too much...
174327034,_PERSON_ for me its a bit from the meds but I still had negative symptoms when I stopped meds for 1-2 years. Without meds at least I was able to walk outside everyday though but not more. I abandoned school after a few days. I isolated myself from everyone even my parents.
175891186,I try sometimes to go to sleep at 8pm instead of 12am but it's so hard to wake up early in the morning - I still sleep in until 12pm. I might try mirtazepine instead of Trazodone. I just need something to put me to sleep instead of 0.5mg Xanax - Then I can stop the Xanax.
175891187,"When I’m on meds, I usually do not experience hallucinations. I’ve experienced such severe auditory hallucinations that I heard eerie organ music round the clock, non stop for a full three months. Then, suddenly, it stopped. I think it may have been a bad reaction to a sedative sleep med. Although my pdoc said it was my sza."

Now that I have my son, I really want to be able to be happy and fun, especially for his first week with us. But I can’t just ignore MRSA, so I have to bite the bullet. I’m taking a probiotic this time, to hopefully help with the side effects. I assume the depression was part of my gut biome being off, because I don’t normally get depressed like that."
174327019,"Sometimes when I’ve smoked weed I go on time portals and relive the same event multiple times in a row. I start panicking cause time does not want to move forward.

175891214,I don’t know. I was the opposite. They kept telling me I was sick and I didn’t believe them. I don’t think they are going to take you away though. I thought they were out to get me too and they never did. Paranoia is the worst. It goes away with time.
175891215,"My negatives, my conversion disorder and my sadness…"
175891216,yea i think that happens… if you meet people and you like them it’s like you copy small parts of them and add it to your personality…
175891217,The last time I had it I didn’t feel threatened because I wasn’t paranoia … but it was frigging scary because nothing made sense even to me I knew somrhing was off with my thinking …

175891220,"i’m not good at social skills. I’m awkward =p i also don’t long for social interaction. I talk to my dad, my mum and sometimes my siblings but it’s hard for me to do as i feel lost in the conversation a lot…"

175891232,That would drive me up a wall. I hate people that are so full of themselves that they think all mental illness can be blamed on some religious whatever.

175891242,You ok bud???
175891243,"am I like your sister, or no?"
174327028,"That’s very true, _AT_MENTION_. No way of knowing how people will take it. I too have used the “bipolar card” before: I had a panic attack while driving and called 911. They came with an ambulance and one of the paramedics asked me if I was on any meds. I had just started Abilify at 5mg, and told him. He asked what it was for, and I told him bipolar. I was afraid that if I actually said _PERSON_ that they either wouldn’t take me seriously, or they would go the other route and treat me negatively or take me straight to the psych ward."
175891244,"It’s important to be in the right state of mind when you do come off the medication. I think reducing it slowly makes far more sense. Surviving on a low dose for a period of time would be sensible. Yet this comes with difficulties, I relapsed on multiple occasions when reducing the dose of my medication."

175891247,"The problem is, I drink coffee out of pure boredom. So I make many coffees in one day. I feel dysfunctional for doing that. But I'm often so bored that I'll just make a coffee and convince myself I need to have one to feel okay."

175891249,I was on lithium for years and it gave me a severe case of hypothyroidism. I was on Abilify for years too and it made me extremely anxious and paranoid.
175891250,Feeling a surge of power today and wanted to speak up.
175891251,"I’ve been online every day for weeks now waiting and looking for it… I did read something mentioning it coming out this month sometime! November 17th on DVD and Blu-ray, that should mean it will be streamable from that date and beyond."
175891252,I just saw my pdoc today. I’m weaning off Zyprexa and onto loxapine. I was also given propranolol as an as needed med for anxiety. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !
175891253,"And I’m feeling grey, colourless again. Anhedonia I guess. There was a good movie on TV but I lost interest halfway. Read only a few pages of my bird book. Haven’t painted for months. Haven’t written for months. Feel so like a zombie like I’m hibernating. I love the night. It’s nice and dark like a blanket. It mirrors the darkness within. It just keeps on coming back. Then it goes away and I feel half-normal. Then it comes back again, then normal, smiling, talking, but grey inside. Did a depression quiz I’ve been doing for the past year and I scored moderate. But I don’t feel sad just empty and emotionless and dead…"
175891254,Thank you for your thoughts and that is a good valid point about SZ symptoms differing between individuals.
174327037,Psychosis made me less suicidal cause I was worried about others
175891255,yeah she had to accept it or else it would go to court and they accept it there

175891258,For me it’s voices and paranoia
175891259,"That’s how I feel too. I feel that there is a bug inside of me and I feel it move around. I know it’s not real and it doesn’t control me, but sometimes I feel like that."
175891260,"What is happening right now is the very definition of a traumatic situation. For the whole world. A lot of people are going to develop PTSD from this. It helps to stay connected to loved ones, to talk to a therapist, and to be able to find some way, no matter how small, that you can help at least one other person. People feel really helpless right now. Helplessness is one of the biggest factors in PTSD. Feeling like you had no control over the bad thing that happened. Maybe you can volunteer to be a phone buddy to someone in a nursing home. Maybe you can work on keeping the house clean for your family. Maybe you can draw a nice message on your sidewalk so people walking by can see it and smile. There is a lot that is out of our control right now. But there is always something we can do."
175891261,"I thank you for taking the time to post these resources. I especially like the idea of a text line, That’s awesome since I’m so anxious on the phone. I appreciate you and the others who’ve offered positive support. I let my emotions about one negative post get to me. So anyway, thanks guys."
175891262,I like taking a shower everyday in the morning.
174327033,i thought my family wanted me dead. Didnt you have that one?
175891263,if u cant handle it better to go at the hospital.
174327039,"I’m off hospitalization 3 years now (on medication of course). Lately i feel negative symptoms unfortunily but i still can deal with this. Curiously, i didn’t think it was possible but in my case i felt truely happy during 9 months…totally remission (as i see it)."
175891264,"Lol, no in general. Things like shoes, undergarmets and socks need to be new, but I'd never spend much more than 200 on shoes and usually, I spend less - I was tangenting. You may or may not have noticed, but I tend to do that."

175891268,I am pretty sure that we can’t heal the brain exactly since the dosages need to be extremely studied and we can’t know the dosage that needs to be given
175891270,thank you this really helped me
175891271,i wouldn’t stop your meds cold turkey! You should really talk to your pdoc first before starting to do it… i think it would be better to taper it off than stopping cold turkey.

175891276,Filtering through memories from psychosis has always been hard for me. Glad you figured it out
174327040,"Abilify seems like a drug that has a lot of complicated mechanisms, maybe there’s some overlap."
175891277,You’re saying that you want us to tell you that you don’t need meds. But your dr says you do. So we agree with the dr because they’re highly trained professionals. I don’t hate you. I don’t even dislike you. I’m trying to help you. Just like the others

174327052,"Hi, so I hope this is the right section for this. If not please direct me to the correct section. I was recently hospitalized due to what I now know are hallucinations. I’m not able to talk about these things with anyone in my life so I’m coming here to try and make sense of what’s going on. I’m lost and scared. I’ve been hallucinating for years and nobody would take me seriously. I always told them what was going on and they all basically told me that I would know if I was hallucinating. I found this hard to believe when at times I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not. Anyways, so I’m my most recent hospitalization it was discovered I have in fact been hallucinating. The doctor also mentioned something about Schizophrenia to which I can’t remember. I know that hallucinations can come from many different things. I’m not claiming to have any dx that I haven’t had a doctor tell me I have. I don’t self-diagnose I’m just a scared 22 year old who won’t get to see their psy
ch till the 31st of this month. So until this day I’m just trying to go in with as much knowledge and sense I can put to all this. I’m slowly remembering what happened in the hospital. The one thing that keeps playing over and over in my head is me in bed fighting with the “voices”. Eventually I just kept repeating, “It’s not my fault” and I was shaking. All I know is that I drifted off or blacked out I’m not sure. All I know is that when I came back or woke up I had missed dinner and they told me that they called everyone to dinner which I don’t remember hearing anyone. It’s like there was a gap in time for me because I’m slowly remembering my hospital stay. I just can’t remember time frames especially with the fighting of the “voices”."
174327044,Get a job with door dash. You can choose your own hours and also choose which food deliveries you want to accept and which ones you don’t. You get paid for each delivery you make and can see the amount offered for the delivery. You can decide in advance whether you want to accept the delivery or not. My older brother got a job with them easy. He says he likes the fact he can work when he wants to how he wants to. You don’t have to do much interaction with people either.
175891286,If you get too fond of it they’ll give you a reason to change your mind. Plus as you said being in an facility doesn’t go well with having a family that still loves you.
175891287,"There are infinite dimensions to reality, all realities exist and none do since reality is always in flux. I recently witnessed the resurrection of a saint, actually saw him alive and well six years after he was pronounced dead. However, then I slipped back into a different calculation of the limit, moved away from him and those who had witnessed him resurrected, into a dimension in which he is still dead. On the one hand I am sad because it was so fleeting, on the other I am pleased because it has clarified for me something of the nature of reality. Also his resurrection was something I was trying to manifest, and I did it. I am wondering if I can do it again, or even if I want to since when he awoke, the result was the Corona virus. Why would the resurrection of a saint result in such a thing, you may ask. The answer is because he spent most of his time trying to deflect the war in the middle east. I think I will try again to resurrect him, but not immediately, for the time being I want to focus 
on fixing myself. Thank you."

175891289,"I was researching broccoli sprouts and how they have sulforaphane in them. It's an anti-aging, anti-cancer, etc etc does 30 different things. 60mg sulforaphane is in 140g fresh broccoli sprouts. I'm starting 3 day water fast again. If I fail, I'm going to the grocery store sooner to get broccoli sprouts and then I'll boil a cup of water to 100C and add half a cup of room temperature water to make 70C and heat them for 10 minutes to increase bioavailability by 3.5x. Then I will quit smoking after my pack for good. Now I have some motivation to kill my pre-cancer cells. Then I'll start exercising again. I'm thinking of just doing online college courses for now instead of buying a course to go to here. There's way more options if I'm just interested in learning randomly if I have no idea what I want to do. I made a request for a kilogram of sulforaphane from a research company in the US and put it under a company's name in Canada that I used to buy research chemicals from. Now they sell things like So
ma, zopiclone, Ambien, tizanidine, psychedelics, etc.. Crazy stuff.. I've been listening to _NAME_, music, going on reddit and listening to podcasts to pass time.. So far I've had a good night and took a vyvanse cuz I want to stay up today then sleep at night and then my sleeping schedule will be better. My mom is grumpy cuz she has to work this morning and shut down anything I told her of ""Does the grocery store sell broccoli sprouts?"". I still feel depressed but oh well"

175891290,"I had a problem today at work like this. Just started a new project, and I over-heard the wife say to her husband, “It’s too late he’s started now” Literally that has been playing on my mind for ages. It’s so debilitating. I don’t know what I have done wrong, and I spent all day with it playing on my mind. All I want to do is a good job for my customers, and for them to be happy. It’s so hard to process all this type of thing when you get super paranoid. I sympathise with your situation, and I wish I knew the answers - other than _PERSON_ and _PERSON_"
175891291,I’ve had no luck with any form of therapy. The only solution for me is to take my meds.
175891292,Nice!!!!
175891293,Thanks. Meal was a bit of a disaster. Cooked veg for the stated 2.5 minutes they were still really crunchy. Cooked for another 2.5 minutes still rather crunchy . Cooked for 6 minutes in total and then plated them. They were still crunchy. I ate the chicken and the potatoes and left most of the still rather crunchy veg.

175891300,"These meds have harmed my physical health over the years, and they have made me sluggish and obese. But I tend to become psychotic when I’m off these meds. One day with my doctors help I will attempt to slowly lower the Risperdal dose once again."
175891301,"My niece took me to meeting. _PERSON_ met me at bench inside, he stood and I sat. Almost had argument because I kept butting in when he spoke. He thinks I’m dumping him because he’s broken/got illness. He reminded me that when I was ill he was there and gave me many chances and now when he’s ill I want to just dump him on the side. Felt guilty. Maybe he wants me to, I don’t know! Oh yes, and he denies he has sz only epilepsy. Maybe he doesn’t really have sz but it’s just part of his epilepsy but still - he never told me when we got married that he had mental health problems included in it. And I never told him I still have sza because I never knew I still did. So in the end neither of us knew full truth about our illnesses. He suspects I’m scared of him because I didn’t want to get in his car. And indeed I was paranoid. He also spoke about Islam - that I know what Quran says and so on, and if I want to wear open neck its up to me but I know what Islam says. I told him I’m trying m
y best. (But I’m not doing it for him anymore). He said if I want to return to my old religion it’s my business but I told him no I don’t. It’s like he thinks just because I’m taking it easy that I’m losing it. Then he got his father to say a few things and his father sat down and said he and family appreciates everything I did for hubby. And please reconsider staying with him. That they will appreciate it if I do. (Meanwhile I’m thinking: you just want to use me as a slave). His father even said he will sign something to commit to driving hubby. But I thought that’s not the issue - the issue is the toxic relationship not the illness or driving. If _PERSON_ had same illness but had positive outlook and sense of fun and easy going, I’d have stayed with him. I wished it could have worked out but unfortunately I can’t change his attitude to life. I was fairly quiet and let them talk. Afterwards when they left, _PERSON_ was friendly again and gave me a hug. Then I went home with my niece dropp
ing me off. Feel ok not too upset. Just a little numb."
175891302,"Yes, agreed. I need to avoid triggers because I tend to have intrusive thoughts when I am triggered. I’ll work on it"
175891303,i won a stuffed elephant once when i was a kid in a drawing contest. My mum was really proud that i won it and she placed it on the closet in my room. From that moment the stuffy started to look at me and never let me out of it’s sight. I started getting nightmares that were the same the whole week and it was the stuffy turning off all the lights when i was going downstairs and i heard it going through the room. i was terrified of it as it seemed to be possesed. They put the stuff on the attic and the nightmares kept going and i could hear it stumbling on the attic. I made my mum and dad put the stuffy in a container the street behind here and since then it stopped. It was really scary.

175891307,Yeah but I don’t have insurance so this is all I can afford right now
175891308,I'd go by what the doctor said Blue_Bird. Just my 2 cents.
175891309,Keep yourself safe. If someone is offering you something that seems more than what it is they are usually being deceptive. Real relationships come from time and people will take advantage of the homeless. You know how that happens.

175891329,I think that the only person who is troubled is me. Wagging the toe is a way to get to be at peace.
174327059,It sounds like sza to me. I have sza not sz because my depressions are longer than two weeks (the criteria for a depressive episode). And I get hypomania. When I get mixed episode I get irritable too but sometimes it’s a feeling of laughter and tears. Labile mood I think it’s called. I remember one day I had a euphoric mood then later in the same day it crashed. I am a rapid cycling sza.

174327049,I dreamt last night that i was in flames…on fire…burning to a crisp…and somehow i was at peace with it all. I think it was my conscience…all of the garbage I’ve written over the years on the internet. I can’t undo or take any of that back. I can only apologize and promise to do better.

174327050,There is a old saying that says if you can think it or come up with the idea it is possible. But is it likely? The odds are astronomical. Sometimes our brain find creative ways to explain what is happening in our lives. I have actually thought exactly what you are talking about. That I am just a experiment and everyone else is in on it. I see clear today though. My mind was playing tricks on me. Because in the end it doesen’t make any sense. I am not the center of the universe. Other peoples lives doesen’t revolve around me. I am not more important than the next person. That’s a good way to rationalize for me at least.

175891338,"_AT_MENTION_ I have a job without responsibilities because I need it to be low stress. It’s great, I just work short, casual shifts. Each shift is a mood booster because my colleagues are kind and respectful towards me, that has a very beneficial effect on me. It’s taken me 7 years of extremely hard work to get to this employment and I’m really proud of myself. I’m highly intelligent with two Bachelor degrees with first class honours - I use none of these qualifications in my job now. I can’t because I’m not capable of the kinds of careers that use my qualifications. I don’t care at all, I’m just so grateful to have employment where I’m treated with kindness and respect. That’s a huge positive in my life. I don’t have psychotic symptoms on my shifts and no one triggers me. I don’t think your psychiatrist is pessimistic on employment, he/she is trying to guide you well. With respect, I think you’re missing the point & how valuable a nice workplace can be for your mental hea
lth. How old are you & what job experience do you have? From what I know of you, which isn’t much, I’d guess you may be inexperienced in the workplace & how brutal & triggery it can be, how badly work stress can impact on your mental health. I feel your psychiatrist is speaking from experience & wisdom on employment. Regarding the group home, I can’t comment on that as I don’t know your living situation or options. I live independently with my cat but I work very hard, every day to do that."

175891340,"I can't think of any traumas. I did have a lot of career related stress that lasted awhile. I'm getting really vivid dreams and some are related to my job. I'm getting hypnagogic hallucinations often. I get waves of anxiety throughout the day. I'm concerned, reached out for professional help, and I didn't get any answers.

So then I think people think I’m stuck up especially since one time a guy told me people thought I was stuck up because I went to his apartment and never talked to anyone there. Truth is I was just nervous and shy and also wanted to go home where I felt more comfortable.

We were not close friends we only talked briefly here and there but I knew him and he was a good person. He got hurt I did not see it but I heard him call for help and I was there right after. I called the paramedics first then his family right after. I was told I did everything I could and that I was supposed to but I feel bad still. I wasn't expecting to here that he had died a few days later. I was told by my family that I did the right thing and not to feel bad bcuz I really did do everything I could. I still can't help feeling sad. Maybe its just generally feeling bad bcuz someone I knew died. I don't know I just really expected him to recover and to see him next door again walking by my front door saying hi...

I have a heart attack, thinking he's dead, but no, he lands directly on his back, rolls over, and starts to squawk and scream like he always does. What a weirdo... Speaking of which, he wants me to ask you all if you'd date him. He's lovely bird, short, average weight, eccentric, handsome, about a year old, loves blueberries and seed, bathes occasionally, will scream from time to time, especially if there are other birds screaming.

I used to be able to do public speaking so good, i remember doing a presentation in front of 200+ people. Then i tried to do one in front of like 10 people and i was freaked out.

I’ve been evaluated a dozen times or more and when they ask me what’s wrong with me I can’t put into words that people understand. Part of the problem too is that for most of those early years I looked and sounded normal. I used to always make sense when I talked and I have had therapists and psychiatrists tell me that if they hadn’t read my charts they would have neve been able to tell I was sick. But anyways, I know I’ve suffered and went through hell and I would kind of want to put myself back in the frame of mind to remind myself of how sick I was. But it’s kind of like looking back and trying to describe an LSD trip. It’s hard to put into words."

So I get home afterwards and my mom calls me up saying she seen me talking to the neighbor and wanted to know what we talked about. I waved and said hey, the neighbor asked if i was cook and bottle washer again. That’s it. But my parents dont get along with the neighbors and told me not to ever talk to them. This about two weeks after the neighbors asked me to cut the tall grass…which hadn’t been cut in months. Of course when he asked i was outside with my dad. He didn’t respond to the neighbor and ran inside like a coward. The grass was too long and the neighbor was obviously asking so he wouldn’t have to call the town. My parents have a long history of pissing off their neighbors. Cops have been called before but their is no restraining order or anything. My parents act as if I’m the antichrist because I said hi. I’m starting to wonder about my parents. Why are they so anti-social? They have very few frien
ds which they often avoid and cant even get along with their relatives. I always thought I’d piss my parents off by doing something bad…like get a tattoo, smoke drugs, steal or get in trouble with the law, but no. Its cause I said hi to the neighbor? Is this weird to you guys?"

175891452,"They've looked for a murmur before. The doctors always listen to see if they hear one, and with the multitude of tests I've had, I'd hope they would have found it if I did have one. So I'm assuming that's not the case. In fact, the ER doctor the other night told me he was gonna listen and see if he heard one. Right now, I'm feeling quite defeated. Yesterday morning I felt great. This was all in my head, I was gonna start getting it under control, etc. Then, I had that extended flutter yesterday afternoon and it cut my legs out from under me. Even broke down in tears, and went to bed depressed. This morning it's just a feeling of complete defeat. Especially since the seemingly source of this was a beta blocker which is supposed to prevent these from happening to begin with. It makes me wonder if there's something more wrong with me even though everyone has said if that was the case, the EKG would have shown something that one of the doctors would have picked up on. I think I'm gonna end up going bac
k to the cardiologist regardless. I think that will give me peace of mind."

About a year later, he broke up with me because he believed that my schizophrenia was too much for him to handle. He broke up with me on the Christmas break. I wanted to write a letter to him in _NAME_ when I get back, and send him a 500 dollar check so that I could pay him back and finally be clean of all the debt I owe to him. So, should I pay him back, even though he broke up with me because of my schizophrenia? yes no 0 voters"
174327096,"Yes. I didn’t have so many friends, but I lost them because of schizophrenia.

175891489,"I had the most intense psychosis. I understand it more and the origin of how the psychosis works too because I believe that although psychosis is unnatural some of it is universal. Basically, the way nature/universe evolves is through Gnosis which can also become psychosis/EGO. EGO feeds delusion and psychosis. Gnosis is freedom from false beliefs/delusion and fear/psychosis. I was able to make a breakthrough, but I also decided to take the Aristada last week. Then I called my psychiatrist who said I have seemed to make some progress/toward healing from my addiction and recovery. I will be starting the pills on Sept 1. I will be off the injections and I am only taking less medicine to help with the sleep and to slowly reduce the chronic dependancy. I plan to begin to start working because I have recognized and learned from my hallucinations and delusions. I have returned from the abyss sending love and light to all who wish for health.

175891497,"When I take a hypnotic or benzo, which both work on GABA receptors I sleep pretty good. I also sleep when I take an antihistamine. From what I read Olanzapine binds with high affinity to several receptors in the brain including histamine receptors, so maybe it’s antihistamine withdrawal causing the sleep problems. I also feel like sh*t when I go off Olanzapine completely but when I take an antihistamine like Doxylamine Succinate or Benadryl I start feeling a lot better within about an hour which tells me part of the problem is antihistamine withdrawal. Olanzapine binds weakly to GABAA so I don’t know if that affects the sleep problems, I haven’t researched it much, but who knows. Olanzapine is a powerful drug that affects numerous receptors in the brain. The combo withdrawal from all those receptors could be causing the problem too. I really don’t know what causes the sleep problems and I haven’t found a solution. All I have found is many many stories online of people with the same proble
m. There are people who have quit for 10 months and still can’t sleep. For now I take antihistamines, sometimes benzos and sometimes hypnotics to sleep."

They’ve been around forever, but you can get the basic idea here: therecoverybook.com – 15 May 16 Writing a Recovery Journal | The Recovery Book Many people who are sober and in recovery keep a journal. Writing things down can be a very powerful way to process your feelings and get them out of your head. I noticed that since it was helping me with my recovery, maybe starting a second journal just for my mental illness would be helpful. So I’ve been doing that for over a quarter century. You can tell how much money I had at that time in my life by how cheap the journals are! I write down where I am with my illness once a week. What are my delusions and hallucinations? How bad are they? What meds am I on. What did I accomplish? What did I not accomplish? What are my goals for the next week. Do I have a plan? What good things happened? What bad things happened that I need to learn from? And so on

175891573,"I too had a delusion about smoking. In my mind, I thought to myself, “Somewhere in the world, there is someone else smoking a cigarette. I am not alone in this world.” This was mostly during my brief time of homelessness. That thought isn’t so much a delusion and was a comforting thought. My delusion stems from that. Later I thought, “Somewhere in the world a prisoner is smoking a cigarette wishing to be smoking that cigarette outside four railings. I should strive to be the best person I can to somehow honor the opportunity that they don’t have.” Another fairly reasonable thought. However when I was experiencing an episode of psychosis, I thought for every cigarette I smoked an incarcerated person was set free… so I smoked like a chimney. Strange delusions."

174327127,Yes I agree. People get diagnosed with anxiety and depression on first appointments and many doctors don’t take any time to get to know the patient and understand the problem.

175891668,"A mistake that I see a lot is people trying to improve on their weaknesses. You don’t want to be good at a lot of things, you want to be great at one thing. Play to your strengths. Not being college material (high school graduate or high school dropout) doesn’t mean you can’t make a lot of money. Go to Walmart and buy a few buckets, sponges, car soap, car wax and chamois (clothes to dry cars). Knock on doors. Ask homeowners if they would like you to wash their car. Tell them it’s free, but if they want they can pay you based on how good of a job you do. You’ll get customers, some will be repeat customers. Buy some fancy business cards. Save your money and buy a used pickup truck. Spend money on detailing the truck. After a while you can hire someone to help you meet demand. A website after that. You will have to work your ass off. You will have to be the best car washer. No job is finished until the customer is happy. This is an example of how it doesn’t take a lot of money ($200-$300) 
to possibly make a lot of money even if you’re not college material."

175891700,When will I get rid of the paranoia
175891701,"I was put on seroquel long before my sza diagnosis for OCD. Just a low dose. It helped some, enough that I stayed on it for years"
175891702,I have a second train of thought. It is not something I hear.
175891703,"I take 250mg of seroquel at night. They started me at 50mg then up’d it gradually till I’m I’m at 250mg I think I built up a tolerance to it becUse I wake up a few times every night now I gained 15 lbs pretty quick but I stayed in it and now have lost it But it will make you sleepy if it’s the instant release and make you hungry When I go to my new psychiatrist next week I’m going to see if he will up it by 50. Hope that helps. Ps, if it’s the instant release you will need to be ready to be knocked out pretty quickly once you hit 150 mg or so. It takes About 45 mins to kick in"
175891704,i just want us who had psychosis to improve status across the board it would be a sickener for others who wrote us off my intentions are good for us here
175891705,"We’re all just puppies. Everybody loves puppies. That’s what I think to myself when I worry about stuff like that. You shouldn’t beat yourself up for feeling bad or for the _USER_ID_, none of that’s your fault. Lots of people love you I’m sure, and if they don’t it’s just because they don’t know you. I’m sorry about the nightmares, I’m having them too. Try not to internalize the _USER_ID_, it’s all untrue. Nobody should be unloved because of something that is beyond their control, that’s just common sense, at least among sensible people."
175891706,"I just started taking resveratrol, heard it is good for raising levels of the proteins responsible for rebuilding the blood brain barrier. Too early to tell if it does anything, it’s my first day. Been taking turmeric with bioperine too, it is an anti-inflammatory antioxidant, and pretty good in moderation (less than 1.5 grams a day to be safe.) Been on it for maybe a week, seems to help reduce brain inflammation. I’m actually on 4 other anti-inflammatories, butterbur, mung bean seed coat + EGCG, Boswellia, and hydrogen water, and I think it’s too much now. I’m off them now except for the hydrogen water, since my brain inflammation is much lower now after 2 months of taking low ORP (oxygen reduction potential) water from an ionizer. I switched to hydrogen water a week ago, which also has a low ORP. Will take resveratrol, hydrogen water, Amyloban, and antipsychotics. Hydrogen water gives an adjustable amount of antioxidant / anti-inflammatory benefit, where you can infuse the water with more 
hydrogen for more of both. Stabilizes the blood brain barrier too, which is really nice."
175891707,Living our lives No matter what happens we must live our lives sometimes there are ups and sometimes there are downs the world changes constantly and we must adjust accordingly we may meet all kinds of people we may see many events and happenings but we still need to live it is a gift given to us at our birth the future may be unknown but we still need to live.

He said that I have schizophrenia that doesn’t respond to antipsychotics alone and that something in the mood stabilizers and antidepressants boosts the antipsychotic?

175891732,Thank you for answering. I Have been at home with my parents for about 10 years now and I have no plans to move out. I am on disability and cannot afford to pay rent by myself. It’s hard having this disorder and being all alone. I am thankful for my parents. If I was alone I think it would be easier for me to harm myself during an episode.

175891735,Both my parents are diseased. When a parent or any close family gets seriously ill or is dying or is dead it really puts life in perspective. It shows how transitory and fragile life really is. Nothing is permanent.
175891736,"My reason for mentioning that was to say there could be some credibility in the older herbal treatments. There are things like Amyloban 3399, Holy Basil, Yokukansan, and Wendan Decoction that show some antipsychotic properties but don’t have the interest (and megabucks) necessary to turn them into something mainstream. New pharmaceuticals take like $1.8B dollars to market, so these herbal treatments fall to the wayside unless someone can isolate and synthesize the active chemicals."

175891751,"Healing thoughts/prayers going out to Happy _PERSON_ and Labradite (as well as for your mom Lab!!) May you heal quickly and fully and be back to feeling yourselves soon. This has been a bit of a rough one for me. Tomorrow we are going to have our dear senior cat, D.C. put to rest. His quality of life is not good, and not going to improve since he is approx. 20 years and has reached the end of his healthy years. He is too thin and weak to stand/walk much at all any longer, so it is time to say goodbye. We are having a vet come to our house to administer his shot, but I fear I am going to panic, as end of life events are a trigger for me. I know everyone says it is a natural part of life...but I just can't feel that way. I hate that loved ones have to die, and I really struggle with health/death anxiety. On top of this, my daughter's school had a shooter threat on campus today. I went to take her out of classes and all is safe (turned out to be a sick hoax) but that is just too familiar with all that 
has recently escalated. It really makes for parental anxiety for something that should just be a routine part of life...ya know, your kid going to school to learn...w/o fear of them being shot. Thanks for listening and any positive thoughts/prayers are appreciated. S.C."

Sister came down with my nieces and one nephew. Stayed for a day. To help with Mom. Talked to the doctor. Told her to take more of her PRN blood pressure med. Might change up her meds on Thursday when she talks to him again.

But then I changed my meds from Invega trenza to Seroquel. Kept taking my atavan and slowly I started regaining my motivation. All I had to do was give it some time. Also positive affirmation helped too.

174327165,"Thanks for answering, _AT_MENTION_ Good to hear you became more stable on 15mg-- but what you mentioned about the side effects stinks. I’m glad the supplements are working out for you, though-- I actually bought some L-theanine after reading a few of your posts recommending it. Have yet to try it on a consistent basis, but it’s good to know that it’s an option in case the side effects worsen. Thanks again!"

I haven't drank alcohol in a year and haven't smoked weed in over a week. I told my doctor about them and he says ""Ah it's fine. I get those too"".

Research has focused on symptom subgroups, but there is a need to consid
er a broader clinical spectrum, disentangle illness trajectories, and investigate genetic associations.To detect psychosis subgroups using data-driven methods and examine their illness courses over 1.5 years and polygenic scores for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression disorder, and educational achievement.This ongoing multisite, naturalistic, longitudinal (6-month intervals) cohort study began in January 2012 across 18 sites. Data from a referred sample of 1223 individuals (765 in the discovery sample and 458 in the validation sample) with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder (I/II), schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and brief psychotic disorder were collected from secondary and tertiary care sites. Discovery data were extracted in September 2016 and analyzed from November 2016 to January 2018, and prospective validation data were extracted in October 2018 and analyzed from January to May 2019.A clinical battery of 188 variables measuring demographic c
haracteristics, clinical history, symptoms, functioning, and cognition was decomposed using nonnegative matrix factorization clustering. Subtype-specific illness courses were compared with mixed models and polygenic scores with analysis of covariance. Supervised learning was used to replicate results in validation data with the most reliably discriminative 45 variables.Of the 765 individuals in the discovery sample, 341 (44.6%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 42.7 (12.9) years. Five subgroups were found and labeled as affective psychosis (n?=?252), suicidal psychosis (n?=?44), depressive psychosis (n?=?131), high-functioning psychosis (n?=?252), and severe psychosis (n?=?86). Illness courses with significant quadratic interaction terms were found for psychosis symptoms (R2?=?0.41; 95% CI, 0.38-0.44), depression symptoms (R2?=?0.28; 95% CI, 0.25-0.32), global functioning (R2?=?0.16; 95% CI, 0.14-0.20), and quality of life (R2?=?0.20; 95% CI, 0.17-0.23). The depressive and severe psychosis subgroups exhib
ited the lowest functioning and quadratic illness courses with partial recovery followed by reoccurrence of severe illness. Differences were found for educational attainment polygenic scores (mean [SD] partial ?2?=?0.014 [0.003]) but not for diagnostic polygenic risk. Results were largely replicated in the validation cohort.Psychosis subgroups were detected with distinctive clinical signatures and illness courses and specificity for a nondiagnostic genetic marker. New data-driven clinical approaches are important for future psychosis taxonomies. The findings suggest a need to consider short-term to medium-term service provision to restore functioning in patients stratified into the depressive and severe psychosis subgroups."

175891880,"When I was younger I was sick for a couple of days. Diarrhea, cramping, stomach upset. I went to the Dr. and they told me it was an IBS flair up and they gave me phenobarbital. I spent the next few days at home doped up on meds and progressively getting worse. The pain was getting so bad I crawled into the bathtub to try to see if warm water would help with the cramping. Suddenly things took a turn for the worse. I asked my SO to call 911 and he called my mom. My mom talked to me and then told him to call 911. When they got there they seemed like they didn’t think it was a big deal and weren’t taking me seriously until I gasped and grabbed the hand of an EMT and exclaimed “I’m dying”. They looked at each other and started to rush around and got me to the hospital quickly. It wasn’t long before I was being rushed into emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. I was bleeding to death. It’s strange how you know when you’re dying."

It would be a shame if this were the only remaining barrier to her return home. Spent some time on Wikipedia, the poor man’s substitute for medical school. Apparently, dysarthria (the technical term for her problem) is common with many medications. It should improve, but we need a strategy in the interim. If she were able to type (not sure at this point), there are type-to-speech programs out there. People with serious organic problems – strokes, for instance – cope that way.

I didn’t know till I saw an obituary for him. I sent a letter to his family, thanking him for all he did for me. When I went to pickup my records, his wife and daughter were in the office. They thanked me for the letter and gave me a hug. I tried to cry with them but I couldn’t. I haven’t been able to cry for years. I think it’s my meds. But, I felt really bad about that after I left. But something did happen at the office though that blew my mind. I was going to have to wait three months without meds to see a new doctor. His wife blessed my records and the next day I got a call that I could see the new doctor the next week. I had never experienced anything like that before. If it wasn’t for that doctor I wouldn’t have the faith I do today. I wish I could discuss more about it, but I don’t want to get flagged. It’s a shame be
cause it’s a really good story how it happened."
175891927,"For me that’s a warning sign that I’m under too much stress. I see my pdoc really regularly so I would just mention at my next visit, but if you don’t go often you might want to go and let him/her know. It could be dissociation or psychosis, I’m not sure."
175891928,Had a nutrition shake for breakfast earlier
175891929,Yeah but I’m too paranoid to do that. I feel like without my boyfriend I could be in trouble even though I feel the same way without as with.
175891930,"A fair judge must be impartial. To be impartial, one must know everyone inside out, and the only one who could pull that off is the Man Above, of course. But He doesn’t usually give money as a sign of mercy. So my guess is we’re both gonna die poor. Which is the same as dying rich, after all. Death is the same for everyone."

175891934,"I thought I could fix whatever was wrong with me, starting with pot. For me it was sort of a gateway drug…because I had unresolved issues. I’m nervous about going into this program, but I think it will be right for me. I don’t want them to think I’m too much to handle, but I’m really not. I exaggerate a lot online. Sometimes my sarcasm can be read the wrong way too. Idk, but things are starting to get better. So far this is what I know: Triggers: Ultra-religious youtube videos about God and Jesus saves, Conspiracy theories about the ultimate scariest possible things, drinking over 6 cups of coffee and not sleeping at all, entertaining dark thoughts or anything negative/toxic to my mindset, forgetting to take my medications, etc. horror movies, being too magically absorbed, being too fantastical in my head (can make me become out there or out of touch) Pretty sure I have Bipolar2 and not schizoaffective, but I guess I could potentially get worse. They wrote it as schizophrenia even though 
I dont have a ton of issues. I’m rational etc. I would like to learn to let go a bit, not be too heavy in trying to be normal all the time and I’m looking forward to getting around some other people and not being completely isolated in my house 24/7 which isn’t good for a recovery lifestyle or a recovering addict. Pride gets in the way for me too. I dont like to admit things sometimes. So there’s that and that’s all I’m gonna say for now. Wont be back for awhile."

174327195,I take 50 milligram of Abilify I think the doctor is trying to poison me I was still hearing voices at 30 mg so he upped it I’m going to ask him to lower it to 30 again because that’s the highest you should take for Abilify maybe he should add another antipsychotic to the Abilify I don’t know
174327197,I’ve been able to draw some hallucinations when I’ve never been able to draw from my head. I also played guitar for the first time in a year and could make up some guitar riffs with ease. I think before I just felt I couldbt do those things and it got in the way. Now I dont put so much pressure on it.
175891940,Did you have 3x week for 6 weeks with maintenance treatments following? What happened? Thanks so much for responding.
174327186,I started having negative intrusive voices very early. They were really all encompasing and took over. I wish somebody could have helped me when I was young. Possibly I could have had a better prognosis.

I have no idea what it is. It hasn't killed me yet but I'm afraid to tell my doctor in case it's something serious. I don't want to know. But I'll have to say something. I wonder if it's a kidney. But I feel better when I lay down. The pain is gone when I lay down. It's always on the left side of my spine and not the right side.. If anyone knows what it is please tell me. I tried _PERSON_ and found nothing.

I know what social anxiety is and we make up excuses to avoid people to protect ourselves. It's Ok, sometimes we need to do that. Please stop beating yourself up, it's truly heartbreaking. We all do the best we can in life and you have nothing to feel guilty about."
174327213,Not doubting your experience but Abilify isn’t LSD and acts on different brain chemicals. Yes things like serotonin are linked but abilify is a dopamine agonist as I understand it and LSD is a catalyst biochemically. It’s a complicated thing but your wrong to equate one is the other. That is just poor science… I’m not saying it doesn’t happen because other things may come into play but I think there’s some serious flaws in your argument. As you can understand this is a support site and street drugs pose a risk to this community. Abilify helps a lot of people here and I’m sure it would have come up if the link was so solid. People with psychotic disorders can hallucinate without LSD present and I’m not sure this is a suitable thing to share here. I think it’s a valid question to ask but it’s not appropriate to equate the two as one.
175891989,I like my life at the moment but then again I’ve received a lot of support when it comes to avoiding stressors. I still deny my diagnosis -now more than ever. My cognitive symptoms are almost completely gone. Am I fooling myself into a false sense of security?

175891993,"yes i cut down on dairy for a while, i know i have problems with it. However its only possible if you replace it with something because you need good fats and proteins. A good replacement for it is soy milk (not almond milk because that doesnt have enough protein). You will also need a multivitamin that has iodine in it. Milk is a major source of iodine in our diets and if we dont get it out thyroid glands cant produce enough horomones to keep our metabolism going and thus we feel tired. Therefore we might find ourselves going back to milk because we crave iodine. The solution? suppliment with a multi-vitamin. Your gut may just not be able to handle it. Theres also a lot of new information about the Gut-brain connection."

He struggles with depression so sometimes he goes through phases where he kind of isolates and doesn't reach out to anyone. My sister is gonna call me later so I'm looking forward to that.

And that’s after being persuaded by friends and family to start. I don’t know, I guess I would benefit from doing things because I’m being taught how to do them.

Dinner can be cooked in 10 minutes. These are filling options and don’t involve cooking per se. Buy an air fryer and cook your meat/fish in that at a fraction of the calories. I cook a baked potato in the microwave for 10 minutes (don’t forget to fork it first.) then put it in the air fryer for 10 minutes and it crisps the skin. you can roast vegetables in 10-15 minutes in an air fryer too."

I crossed this step as well (when I was at university), and tought that people don't contact me first or don't answer me when i reach out to them because I had nothing interessting in my personality. I stayed a long time alone, but since I started working, I met new people and found out I had very social skills and that many people like hanging out with me. Each person is unique and you have necessarily good points. You will find some friends it's only a matter of time. Do you practice a team sport ?"

175892069,"Kinda. I thought my obsession with crypto was going to lead me to develop the Beast system by accident. I am just not that guy, upon introspection. Schizophrenics are world-class pessimists though. Believe me, I tried to contrive some fool proof means of that happening, just so I could humor that inner voice, but it is beyond my ken. I would have to be a hardcore Communist and climb to some lofty position to even have a chance of implementing something like that. Ideologically I am center right, and I am past the age where my political beliefs will shift much."
174327232,"In schizophrenia there is no quite mind and if there is, it’s to some extent a paradox. All we can do is keep living life regardless of hardships. Personally I wish I was healthy, but I accept reality as it is. Realizing the truth of our prognosis is a step in the right direction, denial only makes you feel subconsciously afraid, because we think ignorance is bliss when in reality truth is bliss after going through the process of accepting it as true."
175892070,Had a good session with my T I guess it was good anyway. We talked about hurt and anger. She said my Mom was abusive when I was a child which I have said but it's not great hearing someone else say it and it wasn't really my Mom's fault. She had undiagnosed bipolar. She was doing the best she could. T said my Dad was neglectful. My Dad is a saint. I don't know. Rubbed me the wrong way. But the stuff about hurt and anger was interesting. She says I have layers of it. That's why I'm so self destructive. Showed her some scars from when I was in the hospital. Finally got her to understand that it wasn't that bad and the ER doctor just flipped out. Still have to write him a letter not to send it but to get my feelings out or something. Worked on it. Got stuck. Deleted. Have to start over. Oh well.

Because that's what I really want in the end. To be interested in things like gaming, watching shows, making more effort to talk when I talk to people, get out of bed. She'll probably want to prescribe a different SSRI but I need something that won't give me more panic attacks. I've lost interest in everything. I do nothing. I'm a vegetable basically.. I've said this over and over and blamed it on things like adhd, chronic fatigue syndrome, negative symptoms. But maybe it is depression."

175892072,"Society is not an end-all, be-all force. It simply exists as a collection of human beings driven by herd mentality. The moment you realize that it’s okay to exist within, and also outside of this force, is the moment you become free to accept yourself. Basically, sometimes you just gotta throw up two big middle fingers to the world. You exist, and you have every right to.

175892079,"Spontaneous recovery, we never know when it will occur. Things that we try to forget, things that we use to help us develop and maintain empathy and compassion, we should not forget self-care. Watching a television show, an _PERSON_ movie where he was being beaten with a bull whip and the town's people just watched, no-one stopped the perpetrators, my back still hurts sometimes from the times I was a very young child and I was that person being beaten, but I survived and am living my life. Obviously the blood has stopped, but the scars are still their, another reason why alcoholics should never have kids in their care, so the sound of a leather whip can cause recovery of unpleasant events of yesteryear. I believe that most of us have memories like this, PTSD can be caused by things that we have done or things that have been done to us."

But in my life it feels like people pride themselves on self control (being withholding about honest feedback for one thing) so I firmly believe it’s really doubtful anyone is going to snap at you. In organizations, (another sore spot) people talk behind your back which could occur for you, or the fear of that exists anyway. To me it seems like maybe just maybe, there is too much listening going on… speaking up could be a breath of fresh air, but it’s such a balancing act and I personally failed at it bc like many with this illness, small talk just doesn’t happen for me, I move my back row in chec

Have you also had an suicidal thoughts? I’m only asking because it wasn’t mentioned. I’m sorry for whatever pain you’ve endured honestly, but causing pain to others in the ways you described (not self defense not even revenge - just rage) isn’t healthy for anyone - zero benifit. I think being open with your doctor may help you explore where these things come from. You have the power to change it - why not use your rage against your rage, I doubt it’s served you well. Also stay in exercise, helps to release the anger… maybe try one that doesn’t require hitting things to help the calm."

So far, all is good. I feel great today for once! I exercised a bit by walking. Life is not bad. If I hear from the head, I hope it is good news. If not, I will just do teaching for awhile. I like my job but sometimes feel really tired. I feel grateful nevertheless for my job. This Friday, I will see if I can get orthokeratology lenses too. I am happy!! Hopefully, I won't have to wear my glasses anymore. We shall see!"

They are home all day slamming crap around which echoes into my sister’s office and they have loud sex right when my sister is in a meeting or trying to concentrate. My sister can’t find another rental because the market for rentals here is so tight right now. I told her just bring your desk over to my place and work from here. It’s pretty quiet usually. At least no one is having loud sex. And one day my sister was in a meeting and they were outside her window having a conversation so loud she couldn’t hear what was going on in the meeting, so my sister went outside and nicely asked if they could move the conversation and they verbally assaulted her and came at her physically threateningly. She’s got to find a place soon and get out of there. She doesn’t need this stress at all. So she’s over here today. I’m being as quiet as I can be. And I baked some pumpkin muffins to cheer her up. I hope she doesn’t have to move away because of all this."

I’ve done the research too. But overtime, I have gotten better and learning not be afraid of my thoughts and talking has helped. Exercise also cured it a bit but it eventually came back.

I need to sit down and work on them over the break, I have all the receipts so that's the hard part. and I'll send all of that stuff and I know the tax questions for my tax guy. Also, I feel like im getting nowhere in my love life.

It's as if im a minority, or even a slave, except my boss doesn't even have to provide a roof over my head because capitalism makes it easier for ""bosses"" to higher even cheaper labor. Am I crazy?

I didn’t have these issues on Zyprexa back in 2016. The change will require a psychiatrist swap as my current want doesn’t want to prescribe Zyprexa. I am not even sure if he’ll prescribe Vraylar when its out. He said he will but he seemed not sure, I had to argue a lot with him and threatening to change him, he might be lying."

175892213,"This is interesting but it sounds like it was either cannabidiol or amisulpiride, not both together that was tested. 42 acute paranoid schizophrenic patients receiving either CBD (up to 800 mg/day) or amisulpride (AMI, up to 800 mg/day) for four weeks in an inpatient setting with neurocognition as a secondary objective. Twentynine patients (15 and 14 in the CBD and AMI group, respectively) completed two cognitive assessments at baseline and the end of the treatment period. Also that dose of cannabidiol is really, really large, it would be very expensive to buy that much on your own (without insurance covering it.) It also seems amisulpiride improved cognition as well, but on different measures. Furthermore, CBD improved sustained attention (CBD: 0.47, p = 0.013, vs. AMI: 0.52, p = 0.085), and visuomotor coordination (CBD: 0.32, p = 0.010 vs. AMI: 0.63, p = 0.088) while AMI led to enhanced working memory performance in two different paradigms"

My problem is I get tired of fighting the GP for meds that the psychiatrist has no problem in giving me. The GP was asked to add a med on repeat a month ago, and they have not done it and I can see the written request on my online portal. Some GP there decided I don’t need it long term - going against the specialists opinion. So it’s ok for them to say no to everything and not help me, but intervene on this? Ridiculous situation, and it really angers me how the GP behaves. A care coordinator can help with these sorts of issues."

I’m probably more or just as enlightened as most of the normies. However I don’t think enlightenment can be measured nor ever fully achieved. I don’t think enlightenment is the same for everybody either. Getting rid of suffering is only part of enlightenment. It’s about doing the righteous noble path. And that doesn’t always mean doing nothing. _PERSON_ shakur to me was enlightened for a 25 year old. That didn’t mean he just sits there all day. He was out living his life the best he could with absolute noble truths that fitted him. It just happened for him rapping was the wise path he thought to take. Maybe it wasn’t wise because he died.

175892270,"Pdoc put me on another anti-psychotic. Latuda. So now I'll be on 40 mg of Latuda, 4 mg of Rexulti, 20 mg of Trintellix, I think it's 60 mg of Cymbalta, 60 mg of Vyvanse, 3 mg of Lunesta, and .5 mg of Xanax as needed. Oh crap that is a lot of meds. Anyone here have experience with Latuda? Does it help the hallucinations? I asked him if it was an anti-psychotic or a mood stabilizer and he said both. Plus I take 10 mg of something for Cholesterol and fish oil, and Imitrex as needed for migraine. I'm disappointed that I am on another med but maybe it will be helpful. I hope it doesn't have bad side effects."

175892281,I had erotomania for years and years. Specifically from 2008 until this year. It is really not a nice feeling when you think those kind of things especially when you never find out the truth. Because they you continue to believe those things perhaps. I didn’t tell anyone for years either cos I was so shy about it. Then I actually got psychosis in 2016 and 2018 and he was in both. :(( So yea I don’t think it is good for the mind to leave such delusions as delusions. I mean did he tell you ever that he is not interested? I know he is in a relationship but still I think to hear those words would be powerful

Sure, for a lot of recovering addicts and alcoholics the drugs and alcohol was still working when they quit. The high was still good. But before you make a big mistake and make any rash decisions, just remember what that lifestyle of drugs and drinking was really like. First of all, if you start using again do you really think you could hold a job? It’s possible but doubtful. Think of all the hassle of finding drugs you went through. Think of all the money you wasted on getting high. Before you make any rash decisions, think it through. Think of handling your life while on drugs. Using drugs and drinking does not solve your problems. Just the opposite, it creates more problems. If you pick up again you are going to waste a lot of time and money.

It was observed in world war 2 even, where countries that had wheat shortages had suddenly lower hospital schizophrenia admission rates: "" … In several countries, hospitalization rates for schizophrenia during World War II dropped in direct proportion to wheat shortages."" From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809873/ . The reason this helps is because wheat increases the production of zonulin, which weakens the intestinal lining and blood-brain barrier, and can lead to mental illness in susceptible people."
174327302,"I understand your perspective. I wish I could stop having the experiences I have had. If I had a culture where I could explore the unknown, metaphysical, paranormal or spiritual perhaps I would not feel as isolated and alone. _PERSON_ I know that many of my beliefs were eccentric/delusional. That does not mean everything I think is essentially unfounded."

For a while I lowered my reading level by reading cartoon books but there was only so many I could find that truly interested me. I often otherwise read a little off the internet, watch TV, or stare at the wall. Is this a sign of cognitive decline?"

174327321,I am being truthful. I’m medicated but I don’t have any symptoms so I don’t know if I’m schizophrenic. Not that it matters. I’m trying to get my life on track. Having a bad day. It’s hot and even though I’m on the injection I skipped the medication last night. I’m supposed to take Topamax but I’m scared to start it.

The job I am waiting for an offer on is pilot work but not actual flying. I think they really want a weapons expert which I am not. I flew passengers and cargo mostly. But so far they tell me I am number one on their list for the job. I used to work part time for them and told them I had to quit because I didn’t want to lose my SSDI for a part time job. I told them I would take something full time though so they know I am disabled. I also interviewed for an airfield Operations Officer job yesterday. I think that I did fairly well but the selection process is a couple months they said. It’s another government job and would be a good field to get into but I don’t really care for the location.

I think my main concern would be confidentiality-- I don’t need my professors to know the specifics of my illness."
174327335,"You certainly wouldn’t be the first person ever to be misdiagnosed with a psychotic disorder, but dude you need to calm down, because right now, even if you’re not psychotic, you sound like you are. That said, I’m going to be completely honest with you; you sound like you’re so fu cking out of it that you need to be in a hospital. I’m not trying to be an ass, but I’ve looked at your posting history, and I’m almost certain that you have a psychotic disorder, probably schizophrenia based on how vivid and all consuming your psychotic symptoms seem to be. I see a lot of myself in you, you know. I constantly talked about the same group of evolving delusions for an entire year. I was developing this delusional world for an entire year. It was bizarre and all consuming. My mom forcing meds on me was probably the only thing that kept me from losing touch completely. And in addition to that, I didn’t (and often still don’t) have appropriate reactions to things. I would laugh in serious sit
uations, cry angrily at jokes about my cat, stuff like that. For instance, you said: First of all, while testicle atrophy is a known side effect of these drugs, it’s not a common one. If it was being administered by a nurse, especially one that’s not an RN, then they were very possibly unaware that this was even a side effect. And on that note, I get that side effects can be bothersome and stressful, I do, but the drug didn’t make your goddamn foot fall off. You didn’t even grow breasts. You had a mild case of shrinking balls, which may not even be true if you happened to gain some weight on the meds, and that’s really not a good reason to kill yourself or physically assault your doctors. Like, you need to be real careful with this lawsuit, because right now, if you present this same argument to a judge, you’re just going to get yourself locked up and become a ward of the state."

I had always been attracted to him and found him handsome, but the “realization” was so sudden and abrupt, that only recently i’ve started to question my actions. what makes me think I suffer from erotomania? • I’ve had some stalker behavior towards him: Social media stalking, screen grabbing his stories, snapping pictures of him at work (without his knowledge), saving photos of him shared within a group or text • I’ve turned to numerology also, as a way to cope with my delusion, constantly seeing triple numbers in clocks/books/songs and convincing myself that the universe is telling me to patient and wait for him • I’ve told him of my “crush” hoping he’d finally tell me he loves me ba
ck (not a chance) • sometimes he shares songs and I tell myself that he sent them specifically for me • He often talks about his GF — I in turn talk about my BF and look for facial cues that he’s bothered… overall, it’s just the feeling/knowledge that he’s my soulmate that makes me question if I suffer from erotomania or if this is just some crazy crush obsession? (which I’ve never had before) help?"

Hopefully the med increase helps diminish the voices and paranoia."

175892572,My psychiatrist suspects I have it. But I don’t see the point in being tested to be honest. I shall see what the psychologist says when I eventually see her and maybe I will. If you had no diagnosis and not benefits (if your on benefits) I could see the point.

175892577,"Anyways I don’t really look for faithfulness in a guy and I don’t really care if they hate me for being fat or if they like to cheat. In fact I have a fetish for cheaters. I’m really superficial towards men and in fact I’m quite easy to impress too. I just hope guys can see past all that stuff and even stuff like me being a pen collector and me just wanting to date for money. The truth is I’m not that interested in dating or relationships and I don’t mind marrying someone I don’t love and I enjoy my “creeping” type activities on the bus more. I like having friends too and it’s a big red flag if a guy is ok with me not having friends. It’s hard to find a guy I want more than everything I already have. That’s all. I guess I do want to be appreciated for my nice handwriting but I’m pretty dense about relationships because I never felt competitive about it and just expected the perfect guy to fall into my lap one day. I also think the things the guy I like finds attractive abo
ut me are boring. In fact romance novels are my least favorite genre though I’m an English major and I’m a big fan of _PERSON_. Even though I wasn’t pretty in high school though I wore glasses, we all played the same game and often work as a team and most guys thought I was very cute anyways. I went to a really high ranking private school and I majored in English at _NAME_ University and I accidentally got myself accepted at Medical school at some point too. I only dated white guys till I was 24, after which I only dated Asians. But the ulterior motive behind most of my activities is to make friends and gather information. The guy I liked put up an interesting photo of himself and I thought he was interesting because I was just meeting my best friend who still attended college at the time. I didn’t stay in touch with him but one day the Women’s Group got canceled and one of the women took me to a high school art exhibit. I took photos which I put on Instagram and in fact I won a lot of awards in tha
t same competition when I was younger. I like trending and that sort of thing. He actually found me on Instagram and liked my photos lol!!! So I guess I felt like I remembered him from somewhere and that we supported the same things. Things didn’t work out and we broke up and I knew he was the right guy. But I just didn’t accept him yet except to help me out with stuff. It wasn’t till 2 years later when Tzu Chi Buddhist Group introduced me to a new _USER_ID_ shop that I finally actually drank the hot drink and not the iced one. I guess I went easy on him because I liked him all along and in elementary school I always wanted to date a “_NAME_” because he’s the most popular kid on the playground. Lol. Our first date was boring but then we did stuff on our second date and I got the idea that he would kill me if I cheated on him. LOL… and as you can see I’m squirming with discomfort because I can’t take the corniness. But I hope he comes back for me ASAP because I hate playing the “victim” c
haracter in my school’s musical performances… >:( I’m gaining weight and my parents are threatening to kick me out of the house again unless I skip dinner and learn to starve. But my cause right now are my “social activities” so I have to put up with a fair amount of ???????? sharing rap songs about _NAME_ Scotia and forcing people to be consumers. In fact I was invited over a lot to a rich blonde girl’s house as a kid since my mom worked there as a maid but I did poorly in school until 3rd grade when I got put in the gifted and talented class and lost a lot of support and suddenly became unpopular. Most of my private education were full rides and even though I didn’t understand what was going on I always thought things would magically appear to help me when I needed it. Oh, and I hate _NAME_, lol. Anyways last night I made it clear that I was only going to help my fans and not people who didn’t support me be it that they might be hard workers and it doesn’t matter to me how good you are lol
. Yeah, first time people saw me mad, lol. Found a video by a French rapper about a human being whose body was being mechanized. Guess all that was being kept silent for a while. After some discussion it was agreed that we should do something about this but my dad cut off the Internet. I’m feeling a little queezy and in fact because my grandparents were rich but I grew up poor, I have a weakness which is my low pain tolerance. Need to listen to some music and try to sleep it off."

I know it will improve my negative symptoms like in the past but at the same time I fear that it will give me addiction and hypersexuality problems again. I know that I should wait 1-2 months for Vraylar but its too tempting. Abilify made me do illegal sexual things and a gangster threatened me because of that, he knows where I live. I have no control on my risky actions when on Abilify. I loose my mind, I become extremely impulsive, hypersexual and compulsive. Since stopping Abilify its been over 2 years that I haven’t done anything illegal or have addiction problems. Why is my pdr doing this to me?"

There should be long term meds that help me sleep but my ""feeling"" circuitboard is completely off, so I never feel sleepy unless its 430am, but then I need to wake up at 8am to work, and I can't live like this. _AT_MENTION_, I'll try harder to go to sleep, maybe that will help if I take restoril at 930 and hit the hay at 10pm"

175892645,"Invited a friend over this evening to share in a stew - and i thought we were having a good evening. All went well - wished him goodnight - and he left. Hour later im in the bathroom, and i notice the bathroom cabinet is open. The dirty little git has only gone and nicked my emergency supply of valium out the cabinet! I knew he was a bit of a pill-head, cos he got the sack from being a support worker to those with learning delay years ago, for turning up out of his face, but bloody hell - you cant trust no-one these days. I reckon he would have nicked my Quietiapine as well - if it wasnt in the drawer. I wont involve the police - and surprise surpise - his phones off. What the bloody hell is wrong with some people!? I hope it was worth it. If he knows whats good for him - he better stay away from me - i wont be held responsible for my actions. Bang goes what i thought was a good day"

175892649,"no i shouldn’t have used “we” but “I”, didn’t mean to insult anyone. so the new question is, “can i be sane?” i feel like im pretty much recovered, but then the thought just popped into my head, maybe that is just my condition convincing me of something that may not be true and im still delusional."

175892654,Couldn’t agree more with _AT_MENTION_. _PERSON_ for trying to eat healthy and lose weight but not taking medication as prescribed can be dangerous.

175892657,"_PERSON_, I know you already know that only the cardiac tests we take can answer those questions - whether it's your heart or not, but I will tell you that after a certain medical incident a year ago I had to take a nuclear stress test and ECHO as well as a heart cath to rule out heart problems. The tests were fine but my anxiety was creating chest twinges as well as very high blood pressure. Doctors take these symptoms very seriously and do every dang test to rule out heart attacks and heart issues. The problem for people like me is that all this concern made my anxiety even worse and my BP higher so my doctor added buspirone to the generic lexapro that I was taking. I know that we're all different and our experiences are different but I can tell you that it got to the point that I was afraid to go to bed because my imagination convinced me the doctors were wrong that my tests were fine. If therapy helps, do that. If walking or exercise helps, do that, too. (Exercise does help me.) And what's also 
helping me is getting involved in projects here in the house as it takes my mind off this. Projects can be anything as you know, just so you are involved and busy, doing something. This is what I've been doing: buying unfinished wood birdhouses and painting them. I am not an artist by any means but with paint and little craft additions, etc. I spend some really good and pleasant time on these. Completely taken my mind off 'me'. Are you still working? Can you get out and walk?"

175892684,So nearing my divorce. Ask the ex to split the house equally so that I can get a share of it once it’s sold. He told me no he wants me to just give it to him for free like I had said before. I said no because I can change my mind and to think about it it’s not fair to me to just give you a house for free. He has called me back to back day in and day out screaming yelling and arguing with me. With my illness stress makes me sick. So I have been coping with talking to my family and I have stopped talking to him by blocking and ignoring his calls his friends calls etc. Trying hard to stand my ground and get what I deserve out of this but sometimes the stress of it all makes me want to give up but i know i will regret it. So i will keep pushing and not talk to him and vent and keep my stress level low as possible because i get sick when I’m stressed out. Any encouraging words would help going through a divorce sucks I will never get married again.

174327379,"I don’t want to be too intrusive, but you might think about a group home or an assisted living center for the mentally ill. Social isolation is very common in schizophrenia. If you were in an institution you’d have a fair amount of control of how many people you have to deal with. If you do go that route, shop around. Routines vary from place to place. One place I stayed at for about three hours they kept the residents in group until 5:00 pm. They went to town once a month. In the place I am now, we stay until 3:00, and we go to town once a week. This is just a passing thought, but it sounds to me like you’re in a lot of pain. You might think about it."

174327385,"At the least, drugs are only a band-aid to mask symptoms. They don’t really cure you and it is extremely doubtful that they would control or erase all symptoms. At the worst, opium is illegal and addictive. And Xanax is addictive. While smoking opium may feel good it would most likely add new problems because (using your theory) you would have to smoke it every day, all day, in order for it to mask symptoms. And that just ain’t feasible because it would cost a bundle to smoke it every day. If you are saying a bottle of wine a day , it sounds like a great way to become an alcoholic. If you are serious about this I think you would end up with schizophrenia and a substance abuse problem."

175892718,"I always know when to stop, and that's usually just after I've passed the point of no return and have overworked something! But you're right about how effective it is to choose a medium that prevents you from diddling around. Just shut that frontal lobe down and get the job done 'cos there's no time to get all 'Hamlet' about things. Colored Indian ink ... are you planning wash drawings? _NAME_ pen? Do you ever fear that what you make won't be good enough? That happens to me and I preempt starting with negative self-talk. I enjoy being able to design, but deeply resent having software lead me by the nose. I resent having my hand stuck holding the mouse like a claw, and resent the time spent diddling with things.

(I'm so thrilled that you like 'real' painters! None of this, ""painting with blood and urine"" business!) You've asked a very good question. Perhaps after years of experience, one would acquire the ability to 'create light' via the intuitive placement of shadow. If he did that regularly, it's probably documented somewhere. But reality really is the only source of serendipity, and I'd be surprised if even a master such as _PERSON_ stayed inside his head for his paintings.

175892730,I bought into the recovery process that they teach in day treatment and support group that socializing and working are the keys to recovery. I now sometimes attend as many as 5 support groups and do a little bit of paid work and joined the gym and am planning to next join clubhouse. I also am in day treatment. On my free days I go to the mall or other cafe and buy a bubble tea and it’s enough to make me happy. I have multiple movie streaming apps and both my parents are healthy and there’s always food in the fridge. But I think I do all this partly because I’m afraid to be alone with myself or deal with any kind of sadness. What if my parents get sick? Another family member is very ill. I am weak and can’t handle any stress. I have this tiny bit of nausea at night and I can barely find the effort to handle that. The only things that I can cope with are making it through the day with as little pain as possible. My memory is already bad and sometimes I even try deliberately to pretend all my p

No they can't look up other CVS's to see if someone else has that medication. Blah Blah Blah. They told me to call the doctor and have him send another prescription to another pharmacy. So I did get a hold of my doctor (left a message and a fax and he called me back) and he said while he couldn't use time to call around and find a pharmacy who had it, if I did he would send the script wherever I wanted. I called several pharmacies but no one had it. So Costco said they would give me an emergency 7 days worth of the medication. So my doctor sent the script there and I was able to pick that up so now I have 8 days left of medication (not including today). So I called CVS back (who is getting really tired of dealing with me) and asked them if that was enough time for them to get the medication in. They were like, I don't know. Ugh. You have GOT to be kidding 
me! I've had this medication for probably five years. Same pharmacy. Every month. This shouldn't be difficult. So I don't know what happens in a week if CVS doesn't have it because I called around to a lot of pharmacies and Costco was the only one that was willing to help me out. The rest were like, we don't carry Vyvanse. I'm like, can you get it? It shouldn't be this difficult. Crossing fingers CVS has the medication within the next week."

175892782,"After reading several studies, this of which is one: (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201608/3-ways-aerobic-exercise-improves-schizophrenia-symptoms) that detail the positive effects of exercise on the cognitive symptoms of schizo, which I suffer from the most, I decided 11 days ago to exercise every day. Since then I have been brisk walking each day, until my running shoes come in and then I will start running. The first day was the most difficult, it has been easier since then. Now it is just part of my morning routine. I am not someone who enjoys exercise but after reading how it really is one of the only things that actually improves cognition with this disorder I knew I had to try it. So some days I am forcing myself to do it, but am sticking with it. It takes a long time for the cognitive effects to enact, but I already am experiencing short term effects like improved mood and occasional improved energy level. In addition to exercising that way, I also signed up for B
rainHQ which has online games for cognition. It’s fun so far and will hopefully also help. In addition to that as well I have recently purchased a B vitamin complex and am eating healthier. I will help my cognition improve, I am very determined about it. Any other suggestions for cognition are welcome in this thread. Thanks for reading."

175892828,"webmd.com says about Seroquel, ""This drug may also cause significant weight gain and a rise in your blood cholesterol (or triglyceride) levels."" I took Seroquel for about a week, maybe, and it made be clean the house in about 15 minutes. I just wanted to do everything I could. I had to get off of that. I now take Mirtazapine anti-depressant and for about 4 years, 15 to 30 minutes after I took it, although I had just finished supper and snacks, I would want to eat everything in the house. And it made my toes twitch. I did not connect it to the Mirtazapine, maybe because it may have taken a week for the medicine to build up in my system, and nothing like that occurred during that week. So there was a disconnect between me and the side affects. One time I laid down on the bed in the middle of the day and soon wondered, ""Why aren't my toes twitching?"" I then realized it was the Mirtazapine which caused that to happen, not laying down on the bed. I informed my psychiatrist, and she cut the dose from 
15mg to 7.5 mg., and the overeating and toes twitching stopped immediately. Oh, for insomnia I take Melatonin, along with my regular meds. I take 4 mgs. a night about one hour before bedtime.

174327435,"Last night i barely slept due to my grandmother who has dementia and always talks or shouts loudly at night, woke up several times at night and when i entered my grandmother’s room she was laying on a floor naked and talking non-sense. This increased my paranoia as sometimes at night i can hear almost like voices from hear room. Add to that my dog made literally 10 pieces of s h ii t on a floor that i stepped on it at night and had to clean up with toitlet paper and no gloves and later in the morning my mother said that he has worms as well, so i became even more paranoid, but not causing psychosis or anything, i was just angry, agitated and exhausted from the night. At 7am i got up and had nothing to smoke, so my mother suggested to drive to a shop, so I did. I purchased some groceries alongside some cigarettes and picked up a kebab on the way home. I got home and ate the kebab, felt like hungover from the night and had shakes. Then i laid down and started to have convulsions periodically, but i 
was not cold neither i was panicking or feeling too anxious. As to state previously was pre-diabetic when I was teenager and had similar-like symptoms as I had today just I did not pass out. So my mother took me to an emergency room. Waited awhile and then nurse came by and I said “i feel like pre-diabetic, I had convulsions, urinate often and have thirsts at evenings” she did not respond and went into office, when she came back she asked weirdly “What illness do you have?!” I started to stutter and there were many patients waiting and my mom urged to tell her, so I said “schizophrenia” loudly, i felt really uncomfortable, they knew the diagnosis beforehand and then she called in doctor, when he came i explained quickly what happened to me this morning under 15second which is really for us who are ill and started to quiestion if I am taking my medication and if I am diagnosed with epilepsy.I am like dude, you just looked into my files, you know I am not diagnosed with epilepsy. Then he quickly wal
ked into an office and on the way said a shot for diazepam for him and my mother was running after him and begged to check my sugar levels, so he agreed. I feel furious as I try to reduce banzodiapines and diazepam makes me more anxious somehow. So i got my sugar levels checked and got an injection. waited for a long time for results like 15mins and it would take like 2mins. when the nurse returned i was getting up from a hospital bed quickly and she stopped talking for a reason and were looking suspiciously at me, like why I am not drowsy with that medication, in my head I am like “no ???? i took one time 6mg of clonazepam from big panick attack”. It left me humiliated as if all my physical symptoms are from my schizophrenia and the nurse made me shout out my diagnosis in front of so many people, was acting suspiciously and total doctor’s negligence towards my health history. At the time while i was waiting for my shot i heard in the hall the doctor was talking friendly with other patients and asking t
hem kindly, making a joke and listening to them even though they were talking about some serious bacterial infection and that a woman patient got her womb removed."
175892879,I dont think i have the ability to do that. My symptoms can randomlly incompacitate me in public.

175892888,"True story which I’ve related before… One day, I bumped into my psychiatrist at a local pharmacy during off hours. He had a book in his hand. So it when like this… Doc: “Hello, _NAME_!” Me: “Hi Doctor! Hey, what are you reading there?” Doc: “Well…(ahem)…it’s about a patient who wants to kill his psychiatrist.” Me: “Hey, relax! I’m just here buying milk!” Then we both burst out laughing!"
174327446,"if anyone is interested, i updated my daily activity write up. i also included some notes for the general remarks section of the review. and i listed some questions i got from posting at this website. and some times ive been to ERs in recent years. at the end in the next post is info from when i appied for social security. see, a lot of this is stuff i go over with my therapist, so it isn’t just me being anal about my review. we need something to fill the time. SECTION 9 abilities and typical day catholic mass ABILITIES ***if i have severe anxiety or manic or psychotic attacks, i cannot do anything on the ability list reliably. however, i didn’t check every task on the list, and only checked items for what i am able to do in my typical life. i often cannot sit, stand, or walk in a reliable way. see remarks section for more on that. i also have problems with my perceptions, due to hallucinations. i also often have bad hygiene, am socially withdrawn, and lack motivation. i have to be in the right 
mood to do chores, or shop. i also have problems lifting stuff because of wrist surgery. sometimes i am bad at handling my finances, so i’m grateful to have my father as my representative payee. i sometimes have trouble completing normal tasks if i need excessive breaks or have anxiety/manic attacks. for many activities i lack focus and need to be in the right mood to do them. TYPICAL DAY - -my general approach to daily life is to keep my stress very low, my life semi-structured, and otherwise avoiding triggers of my illness. I wake up and to collect myself I breathe deep and relax from any pent up anxiety. throughout the day, if i am able, i watch news or shows on tv. or, i go through facebook and random internet surfing, and often visit my online mental illness support group. lots of calming music. i decide which to do based on what i’m able to do, lay on my bed with my laptop, lay for tv etc. i usually lay, because i have a problem standing and sitting. sometimes i am physically and mentally incapable 
of doing certain types of these things. i eat my meals. my medication makes me want to over eat so i have constant battles with that. -i have problems sitting and standing still. if i am able, i might go out to town to walk around. if i go to a restaurant or movie, for example, my ability to sit often doesn’t last long. i often have to pace in the building or go do laps on the side walk outside, because of my anxiety or maybe a manic feeling. i always keep my car in the back of my mind, because it’s a makeshift place for me to lay down if i need it, in the back seat, or to sit if there are no chairs around. i’ve also found it helps to walk a couple miles first if i need to sit for a couple hours, like watching a movie. sometimes walking doesn’t allow me enough to sit or stand still, or do something like watch a movie. daily walking has lessened the frequency that i go to the ER. one day without walking will leave me feeling explosively anxious. i need lots of free time because i need to walk a lot to 
be adequate. because of my physical anxiety, i cannot work in an office or sit down role. sometimes i have irresistible impulses to change what i’m doing: when i’m sitting i have to lay down or walk, or if i’m laying down i need to walk or sit, or if i’m walking i need to sit or lay down. often i have to pace around at work, and i’m left hoping that what i’m then doing is conducive to allowing for that. the workers who know me best dont understand my inability to be still. it is very hard for me to go to catholic mass with my family, because it involves a lot of standing and sitting still. when i’m not in town, i either use the treadmill or outside road as a place to work off anxiety problems or a manic attack. -i have problems with my personal relationships. if i socialize, most of my problems are that i have to pace around because i can’t sit or stand still. i also have to lay or sit, sometimes, in the middle of socializing. i try to keep most socializing with people i know, or going out in 
public when in the right mood, because strangers find my behavior odd. besides my inability to be still, i also suffer from being socially awkward in general. i dont socialize with strangers much but back when i tried more in the past, id overhear people talking about how weird i am or get strange looks. if i am around strangers, i try to keep my encounters brief, or find ways to get away if needed. i never had a girlfriend despite wanting one, and have trouble making or maintaining friendships -stress can trigger a manic/anxiety attack. again, i end up pacing around. for instance, going to the therapist half the time is too stimulating and i start becoming manic. besides the mania, i also experience physical anxiety at the therapist… my therapist says i ‘have ants in my pants’, because i often can’t sit still or my legs bounce, or when i’m doing telephone appointments i have to pace and start panting and losing breath while talking… i have to walk for miles before the appointment to stay still, b
ut even then there’s no guarantees. i usually have this therapist issue, and several other examples to tell the psychiatrist each time i see him of simple but stressful events triggering my mania/mood. other examples of manic and anxiety attacks just things related to living life, dealing with cars, health insurance, taxes, rent and living arrangements, work etc. i have thoughts that fly all over as i research a lot of stuff when my mood is increased. i dont think it’s wise or healthy for me to push my limitations by living a life full of potential triggers. and it wouldn’t be healthy for me to work more than a day or two per week, because of how it affects my mood/anxiety and sometimes psychosis. -i am sometimes psychotic or have other schizo symptoms. sometimes i hallucinate that my cell phone is making sounds that it really isn’t, or i hallucinate my father’s voice. sometimes these interfere with me working. (i have to ask co-workers if they hear the ringing that i’m hallucinating) sometimes i 
can’t distinguish between reality and hallucinations. (i might think my dad is talking when he isn’t, or i might think i’m hallucinating a cell phone noise when i’m really not, or i think it’s real when it really isn’t) these usually cause me to panic. they usually seem evil or demonic but sometimes are reassuring. stress makes these hallucinations worse. there are always delusional thoughts simmering in my mind to some degree. see remarks for more on that. i also have a slew of intrusive thoughts that are like gibberish or outlandish thoughts. -night is often difficult for me. usually when it starts getting dark out, i have a panic attack, if i am to have one that day. see remarks section for more on that. before sleep, i try to take my medication at the same time everyday to keep my mood stable, because if i miss or am late in taking it, i feel manic and it gets progressively worse the longer i am not medicated. especially when manic, i fear staying up for days on end and ending up back in the s
tate psych ward. i end up sleeping too much usually, or too little, irregular. an elevated mood is usually the reason i don’t sleep enough. i also squirm when i’m laying down, such as when i’m going to bed, when i’m trying to sleep and am restless. working too much such as more than once or twice a week can wreck havoc on my sleep cycle and it often elevates my mood and causes too little sleep SECTION 10 REMARKS -as it pertains to work: i can’t sit or stand for extended periods, as my coworkers have noticed. sometimes i cannot work at all or i miss work, i often cant complete tasks because i need extra breaks, stress makes me manic and causes anxiety problems and sometimes psychosis: too much work gives me this stress, experience hallucinations/delusional thought, which i have to straighten out with coworkers, too much work gives anxiety that makes me panicky and erratic, makes me pace, causes my chest to feel tight, and that makes me feel like i’m in a war zone and or want to be in fetal position
. when i get home from work, my body feels like it’s in shock, and when i work a lot, my body is that much worse off, and it bleeds over into my mood, making me feel manic. sometimes working too much makes me feel physically sick. the last time i tried to work full time, i lasted only a week. often when i try to work more than about two days a week, i start becoming manic. too much work causes me to de-compensate -i have intense panic attacks around 0-2 times a month. when those happen i am preoccupied with death and i feel like i want to not be alive and the feeling overwhelms me. i feel restless and anxious, like there is nothing i can do to shake the mood, like it is a physical problem even though it’s somehow all in my head. my therapist says it’s probably a problem with my _USER_ID_. i feel like i am going to explode during the worst episodes. usually the only thing to shake the feeling is going to sleep as medication doesn’t usually do much. the attacks are usually not as frequent or intense as 
they use to be as it used to be a couple times a week id have an attack and they were always intense. now they are sometimes very intense but that is only a few times a month. i get a lot of serious but less intense attacks, maybe several per week. also when i’m not having panic attacks, i am on edge a lot, and have a persistent raw fear that an attack will come on. -i have a fragile psyche for things outside my routine. i get irritable if i get outside of my routine and also anxious. if i do any socializing i have to take breaks to go pace around or sit or lay. i seem like a strange person to others when i do this. i live with my _NAME_ parents who make life bearable and help me with daily living so life is usually pretty tranquil. but if nieces or nephews especially or other people not in my routine come over i get irritated because they make noise or take the TV away from me or take my spot in the living room, breaking my routine. when these things happen i often feel tense and like i’m suffocating. ev
en just little inconveniences in life irritate me significantly -i cycle between feelings of grandiosity and worthlessness/depression. i feel like i’m smart with money but in reality i’m just barely getting by living off the government, or that i’m astute enough to become president when really i’m just more educated than the normal person and generally smarter, but no where near situated for that position. i am often depressed and feel worthless, because i am not where i want to be in life. i dont have a real career and have never had a girlfriend despite wanting one, and have trouble making or maintaining friendships. -i have strange beliefs and suspicious/paranoid beliefs and teetering in delusions that i try not to dwell on too much, that i think are part of the disease. within the last few years, sometimes the suspicions seem to be physically overtaking me (the last major time this happened, i was at the mental hospital about to be admitted, but i was too delusional to go through with it), or it m
ight sometimes be more automatic reflex where i’m delusional, or at least borderline so (the last major time this happened i was at the emergency room due to anxiety/mood/phsychosis). in recent years, once i was fearful of being assassinated if i didn’t quite my job, and i almost quit, and sometimes when i’m in a medical setting, i am paranoid or delusional that folks are spying on me. sometimes i get paranoid that the military is spying on me, through a former friend who was in special forces. i dont get involved too much in politics because i had visions when i was psychotic of a scandal breaking out and me becoming famous and then being murdered in various ways, like a back alley or shanked in prision or assassinated. some people might call my fear of getting too political and too well known a delusion because i am convinced something bad will happen if i do, or if i don’t live life properly. folks in my support group say i’m delusional. as was the case when i was first hospitalized in the state 
psych ward, and has been the case for decades, i still suffer from religiously preoccupied thoughts. and also live in persistent fear that i’m hell bound, especially if i dont live properly. when i think back to when i was psychotic in the past, i feel like i may have prophetic or special powers, or that i am being spied on, as i dont know how else to explain what i experienced. for example, i reflect on when things seemed to be happening around me just as i predicted them to happen or when i seemed to be prophesying bible verses and events that turned out to be true. my past delusions resurface from time to time to various degrees. i was initially diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features, when i was unable to sleep for six days and ended up in a state psych ward. the next psychiatrist called me schizoaffective and that i was totally and permanently disabled, for the next nine years. then he died. then recently i saw a nurse practitioner for a few months, and she called me schizophrenic. i told her st
ressful events trigger my mood to elevate, but i guess she didn’t consider that important enough to keep the old diagnosis. today i just saw another nurse practitioner and she insisted i’ve always been schizophrenic. she also said i can’t be bipolar too. i thnk she is just splitting hairs saying i can’t be bipolar too, as if it should just be called schizoaffective but not both those things. but i wonder if she would conceded i may be schizoaffective. i wonder if she just saw the previous nurse’s diagnosis and went with it. i doubt she went through my records much. if i stopped taking medication i know i’d have an elevated mood and inability to sleep a lot. i strongly suspect my psychosis would increase, but i’m not a hundred percent sure of that. i trust the two psych docs ive seen for a lot longer than this nurse who saw me for ten minutes. with that said, i may only be technically schizoaffective, and actually practically be schizophrenic with some mood problems that doesn’t arise to schizo
affective. i say this, because i was probably manic when i was admited to the state psych hosptial (though there are reasons to question if i met the manic definition, though my doctors thought it was clear i was bipolar at the time), but aside from that, most of my mood problems dont last long enough to count as manic, even if they are for a few days. to my knowledge, i may not usually meet the definition of hypomanic either. for practical purposes, i feel manic, hypomanic, or at least cyclothymic at the least a lot of times. all other diagnostic factors of bipolar i often meet, however. as i said, if i didn’t take my meds, and/or i’m under too much stress, i’m positive my mood would deteriorate over time and i’d probably eventually meet the timed definitions of bipolar on a more consistent basis. ER VISITS, inpatient coping centers, and rescue crisis: —rescue crisis: i was taken by police to rescue crisis in toledo, stemming from me confronting my friend because i had started thinking he was going 
to kill me and him calling police because i was obviously sick. rescue crisis asked questions, and i didn’t want to be admitted, so they deferred to me, despite my bizarre theories about government conspiracies. while i was there, the TV seemed to be sending me messages in code. —ER and inpatient center, i had overwhelming anxiety, a 9.5 on a ten being the worst scale. i couldn’t move. i felt like i was going to burst. i had to call the ambulance because my family was not around. first i went to hicksville ER. i was squirming on the bed and the doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. then they sent me to a psychiatric place in napolean, where i was inpatient, where i stayed a couple days. —ER, i couldn’t shake the anxiety so my family took me to _NAME_ ER. i couldnt focus. the doctor assumed there should have been a trigger which he couldnt figure out, and he didn’t know if my lack of bouncing off the walls meant it wasn’t a panic attack and was just a generic anxiety attack. they 
gave me ativan. —ER, i was in the ER and felt the worst anxiety i ever felt, a 9.9 on the ten scale. i was also delusional but lacked insight to know it at the time. i was afraid i would be assassinated if they admitted me to the hospital, so i declined inpatient at defiance promedica hospital. the delusions felt like they were physically overtaking me. i had delusional impulses that i should also quit my job, or else a national scandal would break out and i’d be assassinated. i called maumee valley in a crisis desperation, to get advice on meds and how to deal with it. it would have been best for all involved for me to go inpatient at that coping center at defiance hospital but i was too delusional to do it. —ER, i was restless and couldn’t sleep. my mood was elevated. when i got to the _NAME_ ER i started reflexively becoming delusional that the staff was spying on me. i couldn’t stand/sit still. they gave me xanax. NEW QUESTIONS to schizo community OLD QUESTIONS Do off label users (non schizophre
nics) of anti psychotics experience withdrawal psychosis when they get off these medications? When are you willing to lie to hide a diagnosis from someone? How much insight do you have during delusions? Do you think withdrawal from anti-psychotics can cause psychosis that’s not caused by the disease? How do psychiatrists tell if you just have a brief psychotic episode or something like that? Does anyone know of someone with schizophrenia who got kicked off disability benefits due to medical improvement? How does missing a single dose affect you? What are some auditory hallucinations you hear other than voices? Does this sound like a typical struggle with delusions? How much do schizophrenics experience psychosis in later life? Has anyone ever hallucinated the sense of touch? Does anyone have schizophrenia with a mood component? How normal are manic attacks? What name should i give to lesser manic attacks? Do you think schizoaffective should be one diagnosis or two? How much do most schizophrenics sleep? Are 
these examples of catatonia? Are you offended by the term ‘schizophrenic’? distinguishing between PTSD with psychotic features v schizophrenia? does anyone know what residual schizophrenia is? why does schizoaffective have a better prognosis than schizophrenia?"

In end I got pissed with her, I don’t care much about the money I spent there, but she has less values than me. She could have said she didn’t knew anyone and choose not to answer.

175892902,"hi _AT_MENTION_ what kind of anti-inflammatories & nutrition do you use? I read an article that a certain anti-biotic can get thru the brain blood barrier & reduce brain inflammation but that it only helped some schizophrenics. I heard butter reduces brain inflammation but omega 3’s increase brain inflammation, both are contrary to low cholesterol/healthy fats dietary advice. Any tips welcome. _AT_MENTION_ I suffer from constant imaginary conversations. I know they are not real & that I’m talking to myself & no-one else is there. It is like a constant nightmare playing alongside reality at the same time as reality plays out. Like two, loud TV’s showing two separate films at once. It’s not that I don’t think reality is real, it’s that the imaginary conversations & accompanying emotional anguish are more compelling than reality."
175892903,"So sorry to hear that Please don't feel like towards yourself, it is ok to eat too much when we need to. So don't feel like that please. Have you tired to do anything to smooth the panic attacks? Like count from 1 to 10 slowly and take a deep breath also try to watch something that you very like. For example whenever i have panic attacks i immediately take my phone and watch my favourite documentary clips i keep on my gallery and any animals videos. Also chatting can be very helpful to keep your mind busy. I highly recommend to take a warm shower, it's very good to make you relax. You are not alone. I always feel the same and cry my heart out but that won't chase us for the whole time right? It only needs time to feel better and remember it's temporary problem Hope you will feel better soon and do manage all of that. I'm rooting for you."

175892908,"Yeah even in the terms of symbolism, that's what shamans use. They're healers.. They might convince you of some crazy stuff but so what if it heals your mental state? Medications can be used.. They are material made out of 99.9999% empty space as well.. That's just physics. But there's something called ""placebo"" and people overlook it. So what if it's nonsense? If your brain can trick itself into healing a certain illness, that's good. There's also ""nocebo"" effect; ""A nocebo effect is said to occur when negative expectations of the patient regarding a treatment cause the treatment to have a more negative effect than it otherwise would have."" So it depends on how you look at things.. But if someone is suffering - Seeing things that aren't there, that can cause problems leading to harm to self or others. I do like life. It can be absurd and scary but we're strong people - Take our meds, change the meds, live the best life that we can - Learn from mistakes, etc etc.. And love.. Sometimes hate..

If I try to ignore it it gets louder and if I put headphones in or cover my ears it screams. I had to take a leave of absence at work and now if I’m not back Monday I’m being terminated. Between dealing with this and my mother being ill (I have to find placement for her after she gets out of her rehab; possibly an assisted living) it’s all I can really handle. That whisper answered the gas pump. The pump was making these grunts and it was terrible. The whisper recommended I light a cigarette as I pumped the gas. I said that was dangerous and she told me worst case I blow up the pump and it’ll stop. I had to leave the gas station. I’m afraid of reality completely breaking.

174327464,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Cognitive remediation in schizophrenia: the earlier the better? _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Epidemiology and psychiatric sciences , Sep 26 2019 Impairments in neuro and social cognition are considered core features of schizophrenia (SCZ) since they affect patients' functioning and contribute to poor socio-occupational outcomes. Therefore, the improvement of cognitive performances has become a primary goal in the care of patients with SCZ, especially in the first phases of the disease, as early interventions may favour better long-term outcomes. Cognitive remediation (CR) is a behavioural training aimed at improving cognitive functions with the goal of durability and generalisation in everyday life. Neuroimaging studies suggest that CR leads to neuroplasticity in chronic SCZ, whereas only a few studies tested the neural effects of CR in the early phase of the disease. Thus, in this review, we aimed at summarising CR-induced structural and functiona
l brain changes in early SCZ. Existing evidence showed a protective effect of CR on grey matter volume in selected medial-temporal (i.e. hippocampus, parahippocampus and _USER_ID_) and thalamic regions whereas functional changes affected mostly dorsolateral prefrontal and insular cortices both associated with improvements in cognitive performance and emotion regulation. Overall, CR in early SCZ appears to be associated with neural adaptations mostly allocated in prefrontal and limbic regions, however future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether the positive effects of cognitive training persist over time. It may also be interesting to investigate whether the application of CR in the early v. the late stage of the disease may lead to incremental benefits."

175893043,Severe lack of sleep for a prolonged period of time is what resulted in my first episode.

175893046,_AT_MENTION_ That’s super interesting Have you ever had it done? You mean you can actually get a panel test done to see if there’s heavy metals in your system?
175893047,"Yeah, it’s difficult to know for sure what is causing the insomnia. Olanzapine works on 17 receptors, which is amongst the most of any ap I think. And they might also affect people differently. I have experimented a lot with supplements, and there are some that help. Like for instance if I take a combo of melatonin, magnesium and fish oil a hour before bed I sleep better. I have tried a lot of antioxidants and anti-histamines, they haven’t done anything for me personally when it comes to sleep, although I might get more cognitive clarity, but like I said, olanzapine might affect people a little different, so I would just keep testing. Taking gaba supplement is the only thing that has had a profound result when it comes to feeling more relaxed. I was able to take a nap in the daytime and actually relax, which I haven’t done in ages. But olanzapine is a gaba antagonist so that’sa problem. I read that gaba supplement might cause tardive dyskinea when combined with olanzapine. Right now I’m t
esting out lavendel flower which is supposed to be a very mild gaba agonist to see if it can do something without getting signs of dyskinea."
175893048,"Im great talking to people, when I actually feel like talking — It’s all about charm n character Very easy just walk up to someone and ask how their day is going"
175893049,Hi _NAME_ Yeah I take the Depakote tablets and they are huge! Thankfully I don’t have any problems swallowing them though. The syrup is a good idea. Good luck.
175893050,How long ago was the 5 months on the streets?
175893051,I dont feel it any more but I still get satisfaction from smoking
175893052,Iced tea.
175893053,"I agree, if you’re going to obsess over it that is very unhealthy. I don’t look for it, I just notice it from time to time. It especially happens with a good friend of mine, _PERSON_. We won’t talk for a year, I think of him when I’m out for a walk and bang, he phones me that night. I think it’s cool But if you’re looking for it, you will read too much into things I would imagine"
175893054,"Yeah tbh it’s been the only thing that works. Paired with Seroquel, it was great. I’m already on Seroquel. Thanks!!"
175893055,"Right now I’m super edgy. My mother in law didn’t get the biopsy results for her liver yesterday like she was supposed to, So now I have to hound the doctor who does have the results to give them to us. Oy vey. I’m getting those results today if I have to risk COVID and go around to every doctor’s office in town. Dear lords, you’d think if someone was expecting a cancer diagnosis they’d be quick to call us with results, That seems to not be the case here. I’m pissed. So that’s my day, Finding the doctor with the results and getting the results from them. Hopefully it all works out."
175893056,Glad it’s working out for you. Are you going to switch to Risperidone permanently ?
175893057,I’m afraid I will.

175893064,"Say to get a doctor. If the support line there is anything like the support line here, they will just give you numbers for doctors in your area, not actually treat you from the hotline."
175893065,Nukes make that unlikely. The outcome would be so bad that no one dare try it.
175893066,"I guess blame isnt the right word. Maybe being more accountable and not shift origins of causality to an external force? I guess if i make myself more aware that the cause of my distress is not the fixed belief that something external carries it but rather my perceptions, i have more power to lessen the feeling of distress. I hear that meditation does help lessen psychosis. A few schizo friends tried it. What you did seems good integrating pieces of yourself to be more whole."
175893067,Yes it does. 15

175893071,I also feel sometimes i’m a bad person 'cause I have bad toughts about many people. It makes me feel guilty. It’s uncontrollable. It’s a kind of OCD… I often feel guilty but actually it’s very frequent.
175893073,"I want to move out but I can’t take care of myself. I told my parents to put my brothers out, they said they’re young. Sometimes they push and hit me telling me you have to fight in life."
174327482,No. Not at all.
175893074,I’m great with my exercise and eating well but my downfall has been beer. Even a couple a day I have found isn’t good. It affects me measurably when it comes to things like heart rate and I’ve only lost by not drinking. Booze is just empty calories and a good reason I’m losing now is losing the alcohol.
175893075,Sorry to hear that hope you continue to feel better.
175893076,I got boobs too from Risperdal.
175893077,"Don’t mess with colon cancer. I’ve had it done twice and I’m 40. If it runs in the family or there’s bleeding get it done ASAP! The earliest they can catch it the better odds you have at beating it. If you have anything at all. Yes, it’s embarrassing but that’s what these docs do all day everyday! The prep is the only bad part. The meds is just a mild tranquilizer and you won’t feel a thing. It doesn’t mess with your current medications. The funny or not so funny part is at the end when the nurse says we pumped you full of air and you’re going to need to give that air back before you can leave! I can’t imagine having her job!"
175893078,"Being creative is hard sometimes. It’s like chewing glass and staring into the void (_PERSON_ quote.) You can’t really force it either, ideas come when they come, usually when there’s no pressure. Like in the shower, or playing some game, or watching a show. Or going for a walk. When you start feeling pressure, it’s like you get blinders on and go full left brain logical. When you’re in a playful mood you engage your right emotional brain."
174327484,"It took me 8 years of hell to accept medication. Now Risperdal 4mg is the best for me, no side effects other than oversleeping but I fixed that with coffee and black tea all day. I always had negative symptoms but they were the least on Abilify which gave me worse side effects than negatives, multiple addictions and hypersexuality. It made my personality bad by changing brain chemistry my psychiatrist said."
175893079,"Any experience taking champix/Varenicline? I’m terrified of the inevitable vivid dreams, i’m already on zoloft and the dreams are weird. And are there pill withdrawals? I could ask my pdoc for wellbutrin after for the withdrawals"

175893083,Aren’t you in enough debt though ?
174327498,"I got Aspergers depending on whom you ask…I got diagnosed before schizophrenic which was helpful. The constant badgering about me not having it or questioning it pisses me off because I deal with unqualified and inexperienced health care providers all the time. I probably got a mild case like you would see in Silicon Valley where I used to have a great work ethic and high intelligence except I had poor social skills and anti-social behavior when triggered, although rare."

175893093,Anyone on like to chat with me a little while?
175893094,"I do feel that with mental illness, life lost it’s value and when we talk with envy about who we were before, we mean that we valued our lives at the time. Failing to plan for my future is where I went wrong."
175893095,That’s what I do as well
175893096,Yes I get nervous making phone calls too and communicate full stop. Often/a significant amount of the time I have not got much to say… Just a lifeless person
175893097,are they reptillian. _PERSON_ heard of reptillian aliens that are shapeshifting who are in the process of trying to take over our planet. They have been hear for thousands of years. They have now blended in with our society. They want to be our god and control the population. Just curious if they were reptillian…

175893102,"Life has been hard for you. And it has harshly affected you. That doesn’t mean you won’t get better though. Do everything within your power to help yourself. Medicate and fight in every way possible stress and understand your own trigger psychology as much as you can. You will get better, the chance is there"
175893103,Seventeen. How do you look at your history with meds? Was it worth it to try them? Did your stomach go crazy or something?

175893108,So far i know 2 meds which dont have drug interactions. escitalopram(lexapro) - No significant actions on CYP450 desvenlafaxine(Pristiq) - metabolized by CYP450 3A4 but does not inhibit or induce anything Any other meds for ocd without drug interactions ? I dont want meds which increase dopamine like sertraline as they make my psychosis worse.
175893109,Does it sometimes not work like I take 300 mg trazadone and it still doesn’t work …
174327500,I couldn’t even clean myself properly after toileting at first. Who in their right mind (or less so in my case) would be content with that? Might as well aim high.
175893110,I hope she’s ok. She sounds like a great mom.
175893111,"Anxiety is high. I think partially from sipping coffee all day at work. Plus I had 2 gulps of some this morning. I cant have more than two gulps a day right now and I still sipped it all day. Very tiny sips. The coffee only went down maybe an inch or two max. I blame the geodon. But I'm not too mad, because I used to have to take 2 cups of coffee for it to work on me. Now two gulps will do. Plus I'm on some vitamins that are supposed to help my energy. I have so much energy these days. It's actually too much. I have had a few nights where I cant sleep at all. If i didnt have the benadryl i wouldnt be able to sleep at all. But those nights are far and few in between. The last two times were closer together like within a week ago, but I think its cuz I'm SO excited about moving and getting to decorate and choose furniture and everything. But I cant ignore that I feel hypomanic nearly everyday now. But idk how much of that is true hypomania. Cuz in the past 4 years when I dont do anything all day I'm 
tired. Like now. But whenever I lived with my dad, and had like my pdoc or therapy appt, I felt energized. I just think a lot of this is just because once I get going, i get going. If i dont do anything, then I'm tired all day."

175893113,"When I worked retail, I was a bottom rung employee, so I just ignored all the talk of what we should be getting done, what our goals were, etc. I just focused on doing my tasks until clock out time, then went home and relaxed. If you know, and your managers know, that it is not physically possible to do the amount of work they ask in the time required, maybe you can work on changing your personal expectations. Work at a reasonable pace without overburdening yourself, check things off the list one by one, and when your shift ends, leave and refuse to think about work."

175893116,oh that’s really nice too! It’s good that there are such services huh. I’m also glad that i see my gp doc every 2 weeks for the jab… that way when something goes bad she can help me a bit.

But idk, I feel like sz woke it up, when I gave up on life bc sz was like a death sentence for me when I came to terms with it. If anything, it still is. Idk about ambition though, I’d say ambition is just a means of working around obstacles - everyone does that. Especially many users of this forum imo"

175893122,"Thank you for all the kind replies and welcomes! My psychiatrist said she isn’t comfortable diagnosing me yet as I’ve just mentioned my concerns for the first time today. I’ve been having quote-on-quote symptoms for about a year now, but I didn’t want to seem like I was self-diagnosing, so i never mentioned it until now. Cheers : )"

174327503,I really don’t know if this is an illness. I feel so stupid because I shouldn’t be battling with whether this is real or not. I’ve been going through this for 3 years. Idk where a hidden camera would be. Where? This is so frustrating. Then it makes me wonder if its a microphone. But how are these batteries charged. I know everyone is saying this is a delusion but I really don’t know. Is this real?
175893126,"Wow this really sounds like the kinda thing I can relate to when I was at my onset of psychosis. The humour, the types of beliefs, the connections, I’d go see a pdoc ASAP and tell them everything see wat they say"

Some start doing it to save money but choose to keep doing it even after their income increases. If I were single I would totally consider it. Nutcase"

175893132,"So you weren’t too hopeless to ask me for help, just too hopeless to accept it? That doesn’t make any sense, _NAME_. You wouldn’t even be doing most of the work. Why did you switch pdocs then? I know you suffer. I wish I could snap my fingers and take it all away from you, but I can’t, so I’ve been trying to help you another way, and you don’t seem to be interested. And of course you’re not a bad person, but that doesn’t change the fact that you don’t seem to be looking for help. _NAME_. I do support you. I always answer you unless I’m too tired to think, or if I happen to miss a thread of yours. That said, I refuse to make you sicker. I’m not going to tell you that you don’t need meds because I’m not qualified to make such a statement. No amount of research will make it a good idea for me to be your doctor. And yes, you can overcome your fears with hard work, but if you truly have sz, then hard work isn’t going to do _NAME_ if you’re not on the right meds."

174327507,"I take 200mg amisulpride (and 2,5mg olanzapine) and find its an excellent med. Been taking 200-400mg amisulpride for seven years. Any side effects were very little. Calmed my positive symptoms and hypomania down so well! I don’t know what my prolactin level is but I’ve heard it decreases fertility and that’s good news for me as I don’t want to ever fall pregnant. So I’m happy with my meds combo As for possible osteoporosis - I eat broccoli every day for calcium and fortified soya milk, and try to avoid dairy completely except for a small amount of cheese and chocolate. I heard dairy consumption increases osteoporosis risk, as the calcium in the bones is leached out as dairy acidic in body. So I drink soya milk instead as this also has calcium but is alkaline in body."

175893136,"I used to something terrible till I met a Dr that cured me. First she told me even hypochondriacs get sick then she listened. Then she tested me. Every complaint, every worry. What it all boiled down to in the end was stress and anxiety honestly and not taking good care of myself. Overeating didn’t help me feel better either. So now I try to eat right, keep my stress down, tend to my anxiety and walk a little to combat the stress and anxiety too. But I went from having every possible symptom and disease to now IBS ,anxiety, SZA and I think that’s pretty good. You worry and fret a fair piece from what I can tell and that can’t be helping you.

175893145,"Yes. Internet carries a lot of impressions with it. Depends how we use it. This forum is pretty calm, but videos and pictures are powerfull mediums, and they can mess with the brain. I think setting some limitations on how long you have acsess to internet can be helpful. You can use a software to keep kids (and adults) safe to help you out. They often contain time restriction so that you can limit your online activity. Personally I have my phone set at 2 hours each day, and I definitly feel it helps me keep it real."
175893146,"I sent you a reply just in case you didn’t see my post earlier. Neurofeedback does work, but you have to make sure the practitioner is decent. This can be checked by looking at good reviews. The one I went to has 11 good ones so at least that number should suffice."

175893153,I took duloxetine for a couple of months. Idk if that’s what fixed my intrusive thoughts. Gave me insomnia so I stopped it.
175893154,Might want to ask about xopenex inhaler. I took it years ago as an alternative to albuterol. I only needed it when I was sick. Doctors told me it didn’t have the component that causes the heart side effects and it worked really well tho I was told it is not a long term medication for some reason.
175893155,"I understand. They had a long academic education and responsibilities. So did i though. I dont really attach value to that. I heard some of the young doctors came in thinking they are God himself. The nurses often knew a lot more about medical judgement by experience. They had to subtly hint when the doctors would mess things up, because of the doctors arrogance towards nurses (and everyone else). I also had doctors shove my judgement aside with weird superiority, while i later was proven to be right. And when i worked in hospital nobody could hold the surgeons responsible, not even the director, which lead to the financial downfall of the complete hospital. I think that is a really sick culture and it is the cause of a lot of problems in the medical field. So i happily call the doctor _NAME_ or _NAME_. Or the nurse _USER_ID_ Lastname."
175893156,"Honestly I never was a coffee drinker until 2 months ago and I am now 30 y.o. The reason is that if I don’t drink coffee often during the day I sleep all day, 15+h/day, because of my 4mg Risperdal. I didn’t have this problem with the other 3 antipsychotics I tried but I had worse problems with them. So now I am enjoying coffee and its also helping me stay awake during the day."

175893159,"Good morning everybody So I'm dealing with the news about my friend pretty well: I feel less shocked and less numb. It just never occurred to me that she would really go through with it. I am doing better with my Zyprexa side effects (increased appetite, sleeping in late) and seem to have this under control now. I was worried that the news about my friend would trigger these and make them worse but I'm doing okay. This morning A Beautiful Mind was on and I caught the last half of it. I've seen it before and I've also read the book and really recommend it to anyone whose got a psychosis disorder. _NAME_ was an extraordinary man and he is a great example of what someone can accomplish despite severe psychotic mental illness.

I used to think there were cameras everywhere and everyone was watching me and then that turned into they can see out of my eyes. It got worse when I went to the store and people would comment its just like a movie in my head and then I could hear about four people discussing it. When I move into an apartment people would move out really quickly and the ones left would give me weird looks. It got to a point I was such a strong transmitter that I could project movies, thoughts, smells and feelings into other people but like I said it has to be a delusion since those beliefs and delusions go away after meds."

It’s only 250-300 a month, and they deduct whatever they’ve paid you from your disability backpay when you get approved, but it’s something.

175893173,"Hello _NAME_: I was wondering when you said, ""can't catch your breath"". Do you mean, you are gasping for air once, twice or 3 times? Then you feel okay? It may be idiopathic or possibly a toxin in the carpet.. A Pulmonologist appointment may be helpful, as mentioned. If so, I've had that for many years and have never found what causes it. I went to a Pulmonologist for another reason and had the tests done. I did mention the gasping but he didn't understand what I was talking about . He did tell me that I no longer had Asthma which I was dxd. with back in 1992. That was good. The Pulmonologist dxd. me with another lung ailment which was caused by long term inflammation of RA, since the meds weren't working for me during those years. This ailment causes me to have to stop walking after about 3 blocks since I run out of breath and tire easily. Strangely, when I was in the hospital/rehab last year, a male nurse asked if I knew what caused my gasping for air cuz he heard it (most people think I'm abou
t to sneeze). Evidently, he had a friend in high school who had the same symptom but didn't know what caused it. I told him my story but his friend didn't have diseases, not sure about Anxiety. I did tell him that I looked the gasping up on the net and found the cause to be Anxiety. My Anxiety is only high when I'm on high Pred dose though which was only for about 4 months. I feel fine otherwise after the gasping occurs. Sometimes, it's many months before it happens again."

175893175,"_PERSON_, It is really unfortunate that some people don't view mental disorders as illnesses. I'm sorry that your wife is not sympathetic to your plight. I know that she does not understand what you are going through, but she should at least educate herself about your disorder. We all need support, especially from our partners or relatives. Is it possible for you therapist to talk to your wife and explain the effects of OCD? Sometimes, it is better when a mental health professional explains our mental disorders to our partners, relatives, etc than when we try to ourselves. I understand your reluctance to take medication, but the right medication might help you. When I was first diagnosed with clinical depression, I was adamantly against medications. When I finally decided to take it, at the strong urging of my former therapist, I was not consistent with it as I experienced many side effects and just hated the thought of swallowing a pill. A few months ago my anxiety was at an all time high. It got 
so bad that I decided to take medication again, and it has helped me tremendously. Don't get me wrong-my depression and anxiety still lurks in the background, BUT I feel more focus and don't have too much of a dark cloud hanging over me. Be open to all types of treatments, including medication. We need everything in our arsenal to win the battle waging inside our minds."

174327525,If it’s as simple as MOR hypo function then there’s a litany of possible solutions. There’s plenty pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical that introduce opioids into the brain. Finding one that doesn’t exacerbate psychosis may be a problem but fixing that could very well be as simple as altering dosage and the timing of administration without actually having to change anything chemically. I could see this being similar to using ketamine to treat depression. If the problem is an actual lack of MOR receptors then things become much more complicated.

I worry my symptoms are way too strong to be able to work basically any job; I literally never stop hallucinating hardly–and the hallucinations stress me to high hell as it is–on top of severe social anxiety which has only gotten worse since my schizophrenia has gotten worse. It’s shot my working memory to ????, too. I struggle a lot harder to remember what I was doing if I don’t take care to finish a task immediately. I end up word salading because I pause too long for some reason and seem to straight up forget what I was talking about in the middle of it because of trying to remember a word and end up smashing “edited” sentences together. Multifaceted verbal instructions are a no-go because I’ll forget part of the instructions almost immediately if I don’t write them down. I make a billion to-do lists because I tend to absentmindedly forget to do something I wanted to do if I try to just commit it to memory norm

I can’t cope with the flat affect and anhedonia from it though. I can’t reduce to 75mg as the psychosis came back, only slightly but enough to cause concern with my treatment team.

And it feels like such an abrupt social change. It wasn't like this, like, just three or five years ago. Not here at least. It's like everybody was cynical, skeptical, indifferent and pragmatic and then - click! - everybody is now a militant member of some sort of cult-like social group with an endlessly snowballing canon of bizarre conspiracy theories."

175893313,"It happened online. The demon (real or figurative I don’t know) taunted me, not for the first time, with wild accusations about my moral character and my motivations on this forum. He appeared to be privy to all my activities on here, and even suggested that everyone, my doctors, my friends, ex and family, all of them, were wrong about me and that only he knew what “I’m really all about”. He provided no evidence or convincing arguments, but there, he implied, lied his strength, the brute force of his undivinely inspired Dullness. He claimed to be the most honest “human being” currently online, but where he claimed honesty I only saw petulant BS. Without no one really asking him he tells me often how little he likes me, and even explains why, just like a 10 year old might do. He chases me everywhere, biding his time and casting moral judgements as simplistic and malicious as they are final and infallible. Today he called me a liar, questioned the sincerity of my pleas for help on the for
um, and mocked my existential pain. He urged me to kill myself, which I won’t do for the sake of my loved ones and because I’m probably already dead. The demon’s name is Nameless. The Child is the Father."
175893314,My ex and my son and I went to our good friends house for a BBQ. We had different flavors of chicken sausages and turkey burgers. We sat outside and joked around and enjoyed probably one of the last warm nights of the year. It started to get a little chilly as it got closer to dark so we all moved inside. My ex and I played with their 1 yr old baby which gave mom a little break to spend time off on her own and the dad and my son played a video game. The dog was in trouble for licking everyone as usual lol. It was a fun time but I’m happy to be home sweet home.

175893324,"I don’t think so. It struck me as a personal reflective ballad saying “Im fine. Im not in the big time, but that doesn’t mean I’m doing bad”. I kinda see it as about coping without being in the Beatles. But I mean you could see it into a perspective into _NAME_’s personal well being too I suppose. But he’s kind of defying people’s concerns for him (in the song). “When I tell them that I’m doin’ fine Watchin’ shadows on the wall Don’t you miss the big time, boy? You’re no longer on the ball” Watching the wheels to me is more about accepting what you are doing, even if its less than people expect."
175893325,People criticizing you. It’s usually things that particularly bother you. I’ve seen visual hallucinations of the devil or nazi things.
175893326,"I feel like you are spinning your wheels in mud. You can give up on your life, or try to actively change it over time. That’s up to you. I personally wouldn’t want to stay in bed 90% of my life. You are gonna have to change your thought process before anything else. Obviously your meds aren’t going to change you completely and you need to accept that. Which they aren’t going to do. So you have to find other ways that you are willing to do to change. You have my full support."
175893327,"I understand procreation is a primal need, but I don’t think people should have children just to have them or to fill a void. A child comes with a lot of stress, sacrifice, compromise, financial expenses, and emotionally draining things. If you’re not prepared for that, your age doesn’t matter. You need to be absolutely sure you wouldn’t be pushed into a psychotic break and having your kid put in foster care. Having a mentally ill parent can be really detrimental to a child’s wellbeing if the parent’s symptoms aren’t under control"
175893328,Yeah I wouldn’t be too worried. I’ll look through the curtains and see what is going on. We are in suburbia so there’s a bit of space between houses but still. It pays to be nosy sometimes!

We took increasing sized, square containers full of water and placed them in the ground and then led the dogs to the water. The large dog was supposed to start out on the larger container but he started licking with the little dog. It was messing up the little dogs numbers so I started screaming “No _PERSON_, No _PERSON_!” and woke myself up. Now I’ll never know exactly how much they drink. lol."

And then I’m like, ugh this just doesn’t make sense to have journalism as a minor and philosophy as a major... ...so I reversed them. It just doesn’t make sense as much as I want to do philosophy as a major. It doesn’t even have enough credits to satisfy the amount of graduation credits I need anyway. Only has half. Maybe it really is only meant as a minor."

175893368,That would be a great way of dealing with your unusual beliefs and the distress they obviously bring you.
175893369,With my current paranoia I just try to avoid situations that would allow it to fester so that helps. Yes I got less and less paranoid over time. Having cbt also contributed to this where a therapist reassures u about things and gives u their perspective. U might want to try that aswell if u can afford it. It sounds bizarre why would they want to lock you up. Thinking about it logically may help somewhat. But idk.

175893377,"I think all reality is real in some way, since reality is perception. However, to function we have to stay in the generally shared reality. I base what’s real on what several other people may agree on. My voices are my reality but they don’t exist in the shared reality so therefore they are only in my mind. That’s how I rationalize. As for being in a simulation, I don’t think so. But if we are I’m not concerned since reality is perception and this world is pretty cool. Whatever it is can be an enjoyable life."

174327565,"Welcome to the club, your the same as me, a TI . Could I ask if you have any public swarming when walking about in open spaces, or have a smear campaign running behind your back, or the experience of broadcasting or live streaming your private self-talk or responses towards the 'voices' themselves. Gang Stalking is very common now days as well as being a very misunderstood topic with regards to Schizophrenia or hearing voices."
174327568,"So, when I was psychotic I felt I was fighting evil forces controlled by people close to me. I spent two weeks roaming the streets at night, standing at ‘special’ corners on the street and not eating or drinking anything. Then, the police found me as I was reported missing, and then I was admitted to mental health unit under Section. Right now things are much better mentally. I hear no voices, have no delusions, can think clearly but things are not perfect In particular I feel there is a mental block - or call it ‘negative symptoms’. I want to do so much - to study, to work etc…but I just can’t get myself going - One day I might spend an hour reading (perhaps a Physics textbook), but the following day my motivation is totally gone. It feels like someone drilled a hole through my skull, and took away a part of my brain - the part that allows you to function normally. I can’t function - I feel mentally blocked and stuck. I used to see all sort of beauty in mathematics and science when I 
was at college, but now all I see is numbers and symbols on a piece of paper nothing more I feel like I’m just a body with no emotion, drive or capability for intelligent thought. Has anyone else experienced this? What helped you, if anything? Medications?"
175893380,"I think so for me it goes like this anxiety, extreme paranoia, derealization, and finally psychosis"

175893396,Accepting a condition is one way of dealing with a problem. Belief in some kind of karma helps. After all everything is pre-ordained.
175893397,I guess what I meant is that ever since I started working again I haven’t had issues with motivation since my time is restricted. It seems to be having too much time is a major motivation issue. Have you tried the library? They’re always looking for people to reshelve books etc.

174327576,"As some of you may know, i work full time as a clinical nurse. I managed to finish my degree before my symptoms and diagnosis. Now, however, i’m finding it incredibly difficult to work with my schizophrenia. When i get up in the morning, i tend to feel fairly refreshed and ready to go, although a little drowsy from the medication. By the end of the day, however, i’m just exhausted. I start to have cognitive issues - difficulty talking and thinking. I can feel agitated or irritable, or i can start going catatonic. This is despite the medication i’m on. My current psychiatrist understands and says that my pretending to be okay is the cause of this. I’m worried, however, that i won’t be able to do my job full time. My partner says i should find another job that isn’t so stressful on me, probably one that is only part-time. I don’t know what to do or think. I don’t want to end up on disability.

174327579,Yes. Even with newer meds some folk have more severe journeys with sz. It really is a serious disorder and it’s something we sometimes forget about. There’s always someone who is doing worse than you and that kind of perspective helps keep you grounded for sure.
175893411,This is good advice. I found that too. Obsessing over them is not constructive
175893412,Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are different. Ephedrine is from the plant ephedra. Pseudoephedrine is something that mimics ephedrine but kind of more dangerous

175893414,Got a few interviews lined up but I don’t think I should be leaving my job. My job is the best as I can up and leave for a month or three and still come back to a job. It’s pretty rare to get a job like that. I feel really unstable and unable to make decisions I think I need to take a step back.

175893424,I’m not sure what you mean _AT_MENTION_.
175893425,You’re essentially asking other people to support your delusion and to explain why they support it. That is essentially asking others to justify your delusion.
175893426,Worrying and being stressed out can make it worse. Getting older can contribute to it. Did they say anything to you about a 2000mg per day of sodium diet? Lowering your sodium intake can help if you are interested in that. I know its difficult.

175893432,Hi...I use medical marijuana for pain relief and I know what you mean about it making anxiety worse. In my experience certain strains are better than others with managing anxiety so maybe try different varieties until you can find the ones that work best for you.
175893433,"Kind of. Can do. But at the same time, truth be told. It’s always overridden by fear or anxiety."
175893434,"Oh hey, mc. I've been thinking I would be remiss if I didn’t share this with you. Twice in my life I have been ready to end my life, as close as it sounded you were. Both times I called my psychiatrist and told him I was in danger of ending my life and I needed hospitalization. The thought of being in a “psych ward” horrified and scared me but I did it to get me through the precarious moment. It wasn’t fun but not as horrible as I imagined. Just a thought in case you find yourself in that place again. _PERSON_"
175893435,Yes but in time you will have energy again probably not as much as before meds

175893442,"I think schizophrenia does exist. However, I think that a diagnosis of schizophrenia should put more emphasis on environmental factors, particularly stress. For example, what was happening in a person’s life when they had a psychotic break? So maybe medication, with some exceptions, should not be the initial treatment for schizophrenia. That said, there should be no judgment or belief that a person who is overwhelmed by stress has some type of character flaw. I do think there’s a genetic component to schizophrenia, but environmental factors (stress) may play more of a role than is currently considered. As an example, I believe this website is beneficial because we get to talk to each other about stressful events that have happened, or are happening, in our lives without judgment."

175893448,"Net says there is a product called Power to Sleep, which has Melatonin but less than the Melatonin sleep aid product. Then net says there is a Power to Sleep PM which has no Melatonin. I use Melatonin for sleep, along with my regular medicines for bipolar, and haven't had any problems. If I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep I can take another one. My psychiatrist, and the net, says these products have not been tested, including for the long term over 3 months."
175893449,"I lol’_NAME_ at your question earlier because it’s such a no brainer for the way I feel. From what I feel I think it’s extremely better to be off meds and go to the hospital every now and then, than it is it be on meds and feel like crap all of the time. The boredom effect that every psych med has on me is just overwhelming and it feels too boring to live. Almost nothing is enjoyable and I live every single day in agony. It’s terrible man. I’m always warned about the ‘Dangers’ of being off meds but, I feel worse, and a genuine danger to to myself when I’m on them. My positive symptoms just aren’t that bad when I’m off them, and the motivation you get is just awesome. It doesn’t take much to be satisfied with what you have and you tend to enjoy the little things alot. I saw on a facebook post in a schizophrenia group that this guys psychiatrist was making him take meds because “You are enjoying your life too much”. That was monumental evidence for me that these people don
