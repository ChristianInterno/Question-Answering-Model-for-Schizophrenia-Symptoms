176158082,Welcome to the club
176158083,"_AT_MENTION_ Yeah, my kids are sweet and very into me. Lately though, I haven’t been playing with them. And I haven’t gotten my son to preschool every day."
176158084,"What do you mean? Mixing chocolate covered grahams and hot links? Or getting a rash from them? Or eating both? If you think that’s weird, there are a lot of people who have done much weirder things. One is too gross and too crude to talk about, so I won’t talk about it."
174382545,Some people have different definitions of recovery. For some it means simply being free of positive symptoms.
176158085,Playing piano from sheet music is very good for your mind. If you enjoy it then you are a natural musician. The only person you should compare yourself to is you yesterday. That said it is possible to over play the same pieces and all the fun goes out of it.

176158088,"Well, I don’t know anything about what you people are talking about but it surely looks fascinating."

176158091,Good attitude! Dont let anything stop you from living your best life
176158092,"This will happen if you don’t engage a health professional and get this problem resolved. I have been there and know how you feel, but in the end the body has to rest. _PERSON_ is literally the only med I have ever taken that puts me to sleep and keeps me that way"
176158093,I been using fat burner all my life i been fine never had problem. I never overdose just reccommended dosage. Maybe my body can handle pretty well. My heart rate is normal too.
176158094,Good move. The brain is a muscle and needs rest as well. Being wired 24/7/365 is exhausting today’s youth in my opinion.
176158095,"I’ve been on it for I think about six months. I didn’t gain any weight from it. It screwed up my short term memory for about a month, and gave me a weird feeling I didn’t care for. Both of those things went away after a month, I don’t get those side effects anymore. Sometimes I have akathisia but it’s pretty mild. It’s my favorite AP so far, and something would have to go really, really wrong for me to consider switching to another one. My dose is 10 mg, I take it along with my 1000 mg of depakote each night. My bloodwork recently came back pre-diabetic, not sure if it’s from the AP, but it’s definitely not from weight gain since I didn’t gain any weight. I was drinking 5-6 sodas per day the last six months, it’s a bad habit and my stepdad buys cases of it so it’s always on hand. I’m cutting that back to 2 a day in hopes that will drop my number. It could have just been age and sugar intake, I’m 35 and I’ve never shown up as pre-diabetic before despite my taking antipsyc
hotics for the last ten years."
176158096,Someone on Facebook told me that I’m “that cousin that no one likes.” Things like that and being relentlessly bullied for nearly my whole life have made me think everyone hates me. I know I probably shouldn’t care but it still hurts and I still view myself as a good person and wonder why it’s always been so hard for me to make and keep friends.
174382550,I’m sorry you feel that way. My hope for you is one day you realize you don’t need to drink to cope.
176158097,"I have to go tar my roof, what should I wear?"
176158098,You’re not on TV. You have a delusion.
176158099,"Our affliction can be really tough. People just generalize and think…“Well, why aren’t they working? They’re lazy!” There’s sooo much more to the picture. And for many they won’t understand unless you’ve gone through it themselves."
176158100,I am not dogmatic even with keto. I don’t have to be in ketosis all the time. Occasional deviations don’t matter that much. There are some that argue we need to occasionally break ketosis for muscles’ sake anyway in regards to insulin signaling.
176158101,"I’m glad. For what it’s worth, I’ve never thought you ask for to much. I’m wishing you well _USER_ID_."
176158102,"i read it can go away if you take it less than 6 months continually, higher dose worse"
174382551,There’s many different antipsychotics there should be one that works for you - it just takes time to try them out. My voiced are quieter since taking clozapine.
176158103,"Does anyone get a bit triggered by exercise? I worked out, then didn’t want to eat for like six hours. I really should have felt hungry but I was just a bit numb. Any active people out there who have learned how to have a healthy relationship to food?"
176158104,"My mom’s a fu cking bi tch. Just now, I got yelled at for doing something that she told me to do. Then I got yelled at for asking for some waffles that she said she would buy. Then she scolded me for not eating the dinner she made last night even though I told her that my throat was sore and that I felt ill and tired. Then she started yelling about how I don’t care about how much money she’s spending and how the waffles were $3. Mind you, she bought some cookies that cost $3, because those are important. So guess what I’m eating for breakfast? I’m so fu cking livid right now. I want to break something."
176158105,I dont think its wise to smoke pot but it effects everybody different. i used to be a pot head for years but last time i tried it made psychosis even worse wouldnt risk it if your doing well on ap
176158106,"Oh, for sure. But also check your company’s policies on fraternization. Most have it explicitly spelled out that managers cannot date subordinates. If you both like each other enough, one of you will have to switch jobs. It goes for all genders, too. Mr. Star’s work has two women who recently got married. One of them had to move to another department to avoid a conflict of interest."
174382549,"but little would she know, am just a mad schizophrenic… unless ofc God lets me win the lottery to be a little bit respectable in the whole affair"
176158107,forget about them if you have independant mind no one can make you feel so without your permission becoz we live in mess mess mind i suggest practise positive thinking and all mind tricks you can find by researching you can shift attention and go forward
176158108,I developed anxiety first followed by the isolation.
176158109,"My OCD makes me complete these rituals every morning. Have for years and years. Part of my therapist’s homework was acknowledging this as OCD and not doing just one particular ritual. It was really, really hard and now I’m scared something is going to go wrong with the dogs or something else. I hate being crazy. Can anyone relate/have any advice?"
176158110,I would have stayed in California instead of moving home where my parents are.
176158111,"Do a google search … then be mean to me, I deserve it … perhaps?"
176158112,I have depression with psychotic features. I don’t meet the criteria for sza.
176158113,I am on latuda and can’t get enough of my boyfriend. But before I met him I was celibate and did not masturbate for a year so no sexual activity for a year not with myself either and I was fine and had no desire to have sex or masturbate but was content. It depends who your partner is and your chemistry? I think masturbating is boring and the orgasm is not as intense. My boyfriend is the best sex I ever had although I was more intimate with the father of my son because our hearts clicked and I cried on him.
176158114,"I had heartburn all day every day, till I found a pill for the stomach. It stopped completely"
176158115,"I am the same, but there is distance, if my circumstances were different I would have felt like i could super easily be closer to them."
176158116,That will be so beautiful. And good luck at uni. It sounds like you’re doing so great.
176158117,I could say the same thing about sex.

176158119,I go to a 24 hour gym. It’s nice to be able to go at night when there aren’t alot of people there.
176158120,Or try music with no lyrics like jazz or classical? I did that for awhile. It helped. I couldn’t live without music though.
176158121,"Starlet gets overwhelmed by noises. We just got him thick headphones that he wears everywhere to block out noise. He loves them, and is wearing them in every picture."
176158122,"I read it, and it’s not that long. I found the last paragraph to be the most beneficial. Personally I’m sleeping better but due to less stuff to do, I seem to be allocating too long a time period for sleep, hours that I fill with sleep. The elongation of it, makes for my night’s sleep to feel a little less satisfying, or (crisp?). I’m overall content but it’s still a work in progress. Haldol for me now, and I believe it’s not activating, I think it’s neutral. Anyway, here’s the paragraph: “The study also suggests that the onset of intrusive thoughts and emotional disturbances following bouts of poor sleep could create a vicious cycle, whereby upsetting intrusions and emotional distress exacerbate sleep problems, inhibiting the sleep needed to support recovery”."
176158123,"The people lying and doing illegal things to people, so they are unable to support themselves in an appropriate manner. They do nothing but complain, when they have probably stolen millions of dollars from people, doing illegal things."
176158124,"people think I’m disgusting and gross and can’t stand to be around me. They are thinking: “Ugh, gross”, in their heads when they look at me. I sense this about my partner, people standing around me in Church, people I volunteer with, basically everybody who see’s me. I take a bath once a week or more. I brush my teeth and hair every day. I’m just as clean as I ever was. I think this has to do with my decrease in Seroquel down to 100 mg at night. (Down from 200 mg.) But I can’t go back up any more. I’m at the very most I can be on and still have a functioning GI tract."
174382560,"the Guardian – 22 Jul 20 Clearer guidelines issued in UK for sentencing offenders with mental health... No formal guidance previously existed despite schizophrenia, depression and other disorders being increasingly common in the courts"
174382552,It’s the opposite for me. Things get better at night. My mornings/afternoons can be horrific.
176158125,In a computer a simulation is coded by 1s and 0s but what if the Universe is a simulation coded by atoms and sub atomic particles? Reality still feels real though.
176158126,ah that sucks =/ do you try to fill your mind with other things? Sometimes when i get thoughts like that i start to repeat “i’m _PERSON_” over and over in my head to fill it with other thoughts. Sometimes that works.
174382563,Ah I see. OK I’ll do that. Thanks for the advice.
176158127,I don’t think you have anything to worry about _PERSON_.
174382558,"I think vraylar would be like $4,500 a year for me through Medicare advantage. I’ve looked into it. Latuda was cheaper OMG if you haven’t tried abilify I would recommend it. Great for pos and neg symptoms and I spent _NAME_ $37 for a 3 month supply. Rexulti was cheaper than vraylar too."
174382561,Do you think revealing that your schizophrenic puts you in a vulnerable position where people might try to take advantage?
176158128,Sure you weren’t smoking in there?
176158129,Nice work Ninjastar. Statistics is interesting but not always easy to grasp from my experience

176158134,"I had no real voices, except maybe once or twice, but i had delusional thoughts and delusional dreams with spoken words. They were sometimes in english."
176158135,"Wow, sounds intense. My voices and delusion involved the illuminati too."
176158136,Just wanted to say hi _AT_MENTION_ !
174382566,Negative symptoms primarily and then delusions cause reality and perception problems. I think that’s much more simpler than what you are describing though. I don’t get strange sensations or anything like that and my hallucinations are under control.
174382564,"then it maybe really psychosis itself , i dun know, wt meds r u taking now and how long have u been on them?"

176158139,"Longing for a place that may of never existed. Was 15 when I had my first major break. I thought the angels talking to me were real. I killed myself to become one of them. I didn’t try, I was dead for a while, clinically dead for a bit. Snow dusted mountain caps to the north and east, pathways sprawling like spiderwebs through the gorges and valleys. To the south was an ever expansive sea, clear and blue, never ending. Soft waves lapping at white marble sand. To the west was forest and fields. I always adventure west. Elysian. Pure. Full of bio energy and potential for life. I spent what felt like years there while I was dead. Lifetimes passed in blinks. Again and again. I still long for my old home, it may not be real, it is a long way away from here. I hope I can go back some day. Until then I just wait and try to make the best of this realm."
176158140,Thanks for the tip I’ve never tried that before
176158141,"I had a brain tumor. Many are non cancerous, and many don’t even need to be removed. Talk to a doctor, but try to remain calm. There are many ways to remove tumors that aren’t that invasive, such as gamma knife. Find out what needs to be done, and what your options are."

176158143,"You still have feelings for your ex-husband. Remember, you divorced the guy for a reason."
176158144,He’s in China and I think the rules are different over there. I know this sounds stupid but I need something to distract myself. It gives me triggers about there being an afterlife.
176158145,"Oh, like feeling of hurting yourself inserted to you- I promise you that it’s a delusion/positive symptom. You are more than your thoughts."

I don’t know. I just heard a voice that said, “Are you going to take your _NAME_ pills” regarding my adderall and that sort of made me think I was a terrorist. Also the visions I had where they would torture me made me think there must be a reason they wanted to torture me so I was a terrorist."
176158149,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! I really tried!
176158150,"Hugs today. Just breath. If you feel your stress is too much, go to the hospital. If you go there they will help you. You can do this. Stay strong."
176158151,"I was checking my oxygen levels with a finger meter and it also tests your pulse. My pulse was on the low side, it measured between 58 and 63 switching back and forth from these numbers. I googled the info and it states that any number below 60 is Bradychardia, a low heart rate. I take a beta blocker every day so now I’m thinking that my dose could be too high. Beta blockers slow down your heart rate. Hope it’s not the Risperdal or Depakote causing this. Regardless I’m going to call my family doctor on Monday about it. Many times I feel very cold and my body temperature will drop and I experience some shortness of breath. These could be symptoms of a low pulse."

176158157,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 1515
176158158,You know yourself better. Maybe you can have emergency pills only. My psy prescribed me emergency pills on top of my regular antipsychotic. You will be much better if you can function without meds. Few SZs can do that.
176158159,"Well, I think you’re playing tough guy because you’ve been hurt. You just forgot who your adversary was."
176158160,I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour. I’ll shut up now.

176158165,My mind has been much improved since going off of lithium and starting zoloft.
176158166,"Ah same here though I still hear faint voices and get a little delusional but I fight it. It’s amazing how the brain does these things. I’m feeling better now but mostly attributable to my meds. That and some epiphanies. I’m still depressed though and it’s hampering my life. Soon, soon I will feel even better. Cutting drugs and alcohol out has also been helpful. It hinders the social life a bit but worth it I suppose. Sucks to be dealt this hand but I make the most of it and it looks like you do too. Best wishes."

176158170,"I myself am on three AP’s. I take Risperdal Consta shots, Geodon, and Seroquel. None are prn’s. They work really well for me. I have minimal side effects."
176158171,"I started at 40 mg geodon, which was supposed to be a titration dose, but it was effective so they left me on it. I was an idiot and decided that since it was such a low dose, I probably didn’t need it at all. I went off my meds and quickly relapsed. Then they had to dial me all the way up to 180 mg for a few months so I could stabilize. After I was stable, they slowly lowered my dose until my symptoms started coming back, then raised it to the last effective dose. And that’s how I ended up on 80 mg, where I’ve been for over a year. I’ve had no hallucinations since February 2017, but when I tried lowering to 60 mg I had terrible mood swings."
176158172,"Well if you lost weight through increased activity that doesn’t sound as bad, but you still probably need to eat more. If that doesn’t improve your physical strength maybe you should get a checkup."
176158173,I took two pills (instead of 1) of the med for extrapyramidal symptoms. It’s better now. I will call my psychiatrist first thing in the morning. Thanks

176158175,Do you have any difficulty on your toilet habits?
176158176,"i agree to some of what the people mentioned here. different people deals with depression differently. and must be dealt quite a small difference for each person in case to case basis. person A routines might not totally work on person’s B live, due to character and needs differences. but there are quite a few main stream to follow things through, you just have to twig it or find an alternatives to certain routines. it’s quite about finding back a lifestyle that suits you yet is healthy for you both for your mind and body. or at a higher religious level maybe you can call it ZEN? i don’t know. but it is partly or maybe mainly to find back “yourself”. Be in peace with yourself so that your surroundings doesnt affects you at some point. So here are some points to apply in your life for depressed ones: exercise quite regularly (my colleague life dumbbells at home, but for me i walk around place and explore while carrying a rather heavy bag to add weigh) escape the environment which is causin
g your depressed form, (either mind or emotionally), maybe can try spending lesser time at the environment that is causing the pain? find true friends, people whom understands and yet accepts you as who you are, while correcting you at the right times. and they are the ones that doesn’t judge you nor label you. learn to protect yourself, don’t give others chance to hurt you. you hold this power in your hands, don’t give others the power over you. find extra help if you need like going to a social worker for more advise and help or emotional support, find more allies that stand with you spiritually and emotionally. Try to find what sleep patterns suits you, different people sleep time might varies. good luck on life, life would always be better somehow for some people. _NAME_ a.k.a lordarous"

176158187,It’s good you came so far and realize drugs and alcohol can’t fix your mind. It’s good you found things that work and that you can drive a car. That must be a good accomplished feeling not having any of those problems anymore!

Well this is what I wrote “I’m gonna use real flowers and stuff to make a garden and glue and markers and stuff on a whiteboard” Well I wanna do something cooler so this is my idea now I’m gonna get a giant white board and I’m gonna go to a flower garden plus a grocery store to get corn, tomatoes and stuff and maybe some fungi/mushrooms to add. And I’m gonna superglue it to the board. Then I’m gonna get spray paint and spray paint all different colors and make it colorful. And that’s all I got so far but it’s gonna be called Colorful Garden. Maybe. Well that’s the theme. Then I’m gonna bring it in to class to present. Do you have any additional ideas to make my project cool ??"
174382584,This is really intriguing. Unfortunately I think your memories of past lives are a delusion part of the schizophrenia. But what do I know. I have an open mind and maybe there are parallel universes and reincarnation and maybe some of that is leaking into your memories. I’ve never had any of this but you could be having some sort of psychic visions if that’s even a real thing. Probably delusions though. I don’t get delusions just voices so I don’t know what it’s like.
176158210,when did this start? When that happened to me they took me off the antipsychotic I was on and switched me to something else right away to stop it and added benztropine to stop the movement. It took quite sometime for the facial movement to completely go away. I would sort of purse my lips automatically. Also my hands were twitching but that seemed to go away quicker mostly. Every once in awhile it still twitches.

176158212,"You should try to have a little ritual in the morning where you reflect on your difficulties, say 10 minutes or so, maybe write down your thoughts to get it out of your system. Then for the rest of the day you don’t think about it any more. When you are boiling with negativity you will not be able to attract anything positive from other people. People pick up on that, even if you are trying to pretend everything is fine on the surface. But if you manage to focus on being positive you may be surprised how things can change for you. Just try it for a week at least. You have nothing to lose. My aunt lived with lupus for over 20 years I think. I’m sure she suffered a lot. But she never complained and didn’t talk much about it. She stayed social and kept active focusing on things outside of her. People respect someone who is able to remain calm and positive even in the face of extreme difficulties. I’m by no means saying it’s easy or that everyone posesses the strenght to do so, but something 
to think about. Basically you have to tell yourself there is always someone worse off than you are in this world and give the self-destruction dialogue a rest. The world is hard enough without you being your own enemy. You don’t have to stay strong all time, everyone has a trip down in the cellar once in a while, it’s only human. I too have considered suicide under depressing circumstances, but for the most time I am able to stay positive, and it helps me, and it makes it easier for others to be social with me."

Note: When deciding your level of garlic try roasting a bulb of garlic, by cutting the top off the entire bulb, drizzling with a tablespoon of _NAME_ oil, loosely enveloping in foil and baking at 400 degrees until softened, about 25 minutes. Then slowly add more and more of the roasted garlic until the potatoes are garlicy enough for you.

176158248,"From wikipedia: Some people hold that, while it cannot be proven that anything independent of one’s mind exists, the point that solipsism makes is irrelevant. This is because, whether the world as we perceive it exists independently or not, we cannot escape this perception (except via death), hence it is best to act assuming that the world is independent of our minds.[5] There is also the issue of plausibility to consider. If one is the only mind in existence, then one is maintaining that one’s mind alone created all of which one is apparently aware. This includes the symphonies of _PERSON_, the works of _PERSON_, all of mathematics and science (which one can access via one’s phantom libraries), etc. Critics of solipsism find this somewhat implausible.[ citation needed ] However, being aware simply acknowledges its existence; it does not identify the actual creations until they are observed by the user. I also would like to ask and say would the negation of this be true? Like if you are one m
ind and you created everything, then what about no mind and created nothing? Or some other logical _USER_ID_ like you are one mind and created nothing, or are no mind and created everything? Just thinking out-loud here. Personally, I came to the conclusion it’s real enough (due to physics. I think the answer lies in physics). And it doesn’t much matter because it doesn’t really affect me anymore. I just enjoy life as best I can. I feel like I’m most qualified to answer whether this is true or not. I don’t think we can be all of one because that’s probably God and we are one aspect of him in some religions like I’ve heard of ‘Godmind’ from some people. Personally, I think I’ve experienced no consciousness (philosophical zombie), found out we lived in a sim, brain in a vat, and also had my consciousness put back in like transferred and uploaded. I escaped the simulation and was part of the creative process. (delusion part of me) I also experienced time travel among other things. I came to th
e belief that even if I was simulated and in a brain in a vat I’m still real in some sense just mostly somewhere else like a phantom being with phantom memories. Maybe I’m still real in the real world. I also remember stuff like “Chinese room” and “halting problem” and stuff with _PERSON_ like computers can’t make logical leaps and jumps like humans can, right? I don’t know. Just stuff I randomly put in my head when thinking about this. If you were the only mind here, why can’t you solve the ‘halting problem’. Are you limited in your capabilities/understanding and what about God? Then did you come up with the physical existence of it? If I told you the Riemann Hypothesis was solved in the future, was that you or someone else? How would you know? Last, if you were behind a even horizon in spacetime, or cut off from time and space, would you still exist lol? I don’t know. I tend to think you would."

174382581,"PREbiotics might be helpful. Maybe. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Can prebiotics assist in the management of cognition and weight gain in schizophrenia? AC _PERSON_, PWJ Burnet and BR Lennox, Psychoneuroendocrinology , 2018 09 Schizophrenia is among the top half of the 25 leading causes of disabilities worldwide with a 10-20?year decrease in life expectancy. Ineffective pharmacotherapy in the management of cognitive deficits and weight gain are known to be significant contributors; therefore interventions that may mitigate one, or both, of these parameters would be highly beneficial. Manipulation of the gut microbiome using dietary supplements such as prebiotics may be one such intervention. Preclinical studies have shown that a 2-4 week dietary supplementation with a prebiotic has beneficial effects on learning and memory, and prevents pro-inflammatory signals that are detrimental to cognitive processes. Furthermore, prebiotics influence metabolism, and in obesity they increase the expression of anorexigenic g
ut hormones such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine, glucagon-like peptide 1 and leptin, as well as decrease levels of orexigenic hormones such as ghrelin. Despite compelling evidence for the pro-cognitive and neuroprotective effects of prebiotics in rodents, their ability to alleviate cognitive deficits or enhance cognition needs to be evaluated in humans. Here we suggest that important symptoms associated with schizophrenia, such as cognitive impairment and weight gain, may benefit from concurrent prebiotic therapy."

176158337,"Reasoning and logic can be helpful, yes, but it is not easy when you are in the middle of it all. The more you come out of it, the easier it gets to stay out of it. In other words, the first part is the most difficult. Sometimes, a small dose of neuroleptic can help you come out of the worst of it, enough so that you can use logic to good effect. You can gradually reduce the dose as you learn to deal with your issues, and likewise, you can increase the dose if/when that turns out necessary. As an example of a cognitive trick you can use, when I was afraid that people could read my thoughts, I simply put that fear to the test. I started deliberately thinking about things I was particularly afraid others would find out. I kept at it, waiting for feedback to prove my fear was real. Guess what? I got no feedback to suggest anyone else knew what I was thinking! That reassured me that it was needless to worry about it. -_NAME_."
176158338,So I read in the janssen invega official document via google that they advise to take it before or after breakfast in the morning. They further advise to be consistent before or after breakfast. I’m wondering though why they advise to take the medicine in the morning and not evening? If functioning normally during day will be helped by taking the med. early morning I might give it a try! Suggestions?

174382602,LS! For the last two years I have been training every day. I am 62 and when I was younger I was the strongest in the gym. Today the gym opened for the first time in months and I went there. I did strength exercises and I was almost as strong as three and a half months ago when the gym closed. My quadriceps leg extension three times eight reps with 134 kilo is elite strength according to the website Strengthlevel. The life expectancy for a man with schizophrenia in the Western World is 59.9 years and exercise surely extends my life. Do I feel better? Yes!
176158342,"Depends on relationship with that person, for me"
176158343,Yes that helps a lot. Thankyou!

They can hack brains for sure and my dreams (inception/dreamscape) stuff has been ?????? with hardcore every day by aliens or satellites/radio/cell phone towers.

Keep an open mind on me, all I ask is that you don’t make this place an impossible challenge. I will get away from this place if I ever believed that. And while I’m at it, a little more ‘offense’ from me. During last Winter I tagged every moderator because I was upset and thought I was being gaslit, by _PERSON_. That was met with silence. Without burying the lead, and giving away a sort of position of mine: Does this place ever feel to you that it’s much more about ‘the buns’, and less than the ‘hotdog’ itself?’ It’s fighting words, but it’s crossed my mind and now you can say the next meaningful thing.

176158408,"Self-awareness might help. I know I get told off for doing it, but ruminate for a little while on what you were like at the extremest point, and where you are now. You must be able to see from doing that that the meds are well worth taking to keep you stable."

176158410,I saw both of them for about a year. I go through psychosis every 3 or 4 months no matter what it seems.
176158411,"Yeah. Most of the stuff is way out there. Everything is like morally corrupt or whatever. I have gotten much better at getting away from it. My goal is to stay away from it for good, but it’s hard. The longest I lasted is like 3-4 months, and it always feels like getting out of a self-made prison when I have been away from it for a while. I remember I saw my first porn movie when I was 14 years old, and that was kind of my introduction to sexuality. I got totally off with the wrong ideas. When you are so young you don’t question stuff, you just think that whatever exists is the way it’s supposed to be. I think about the kids growing up these days…it’s like 10 times worse. It’s really hard to protect them from it the way the system is today."
176158412,I wouldn’t put too much faith in a phone to make things right. You will find yourself dissatisfied with it after a little while.
176158413,After nearly 8 months on Invega it’s started to raise my prolactin levels and we need to switch medications again. My psychiatrist wants to put me on Haldol and eventually switch to the long acting injection. What can you guys tell me about Haldol? Anyone here on the long acting injection? I’m nervous to make the change especially since I’ve been doing so well.

176158415,Some theories are flat out wrong. Some kind of make sense and might or might not be true. False beliefs are something everyone has. Incorrect thoughts happen all the time. Belief in god is something that might or might not be true. Belief in aliens might or might not be true the galaxy is enormous. Belief that _NAME_ _PERSON_ is a clone or something is pretty crazy and most people do not believe that. Belief that jfk was murdered by the cia or something is not all that delusional. That’s just a bunch of theories. But incorrect thoughts happen to everyone. The problem I have with something like _PERSON_ is that the people that watch it seem very brainwashed. Although just because you believe in conspiracy theories doesn’t mean your psychotic. They’re interesting and fun for people who read them. Also some people are prone to that because of the way they think. They might think in terms of everything being black and white such as I’m not rich and famous so every rich and famous person must be 
in the Illuminati because it must be impossible to become that without being bad and having secrets. Everyone is different and most are not psychotic!
176158416,That applies to me too.
176158417,I think it’s a safe bet to assume that people who want you to live also want you to be happy.

174382618,I suppose that would depend on whether or not you got the generic. A quick internet search says about $1000 a month for a 30 day supply. not sure how accurate that is though. Insurance pays for mine so I dont know.
176158422,Just curious have you ever checked your prolactin levels on risperidone ? How much is it ?
174382616,"_AT_MENTION_ You know I’ve said for years now that you should compilate your short poems into a book form and sell it. There’s no time like now to get on that train, my man! Call it something like ‘Schizophrenic Short Poetry’ I bet it would sell like hotcakes!"
176158423,"Its simple, but hard to keep too. Drink in moderation Always take your meds (even tho you are feeling well) And lay off the drugs. The rest of your learning curve in your recovery - is all in your court mate."
176158424,"Sometimes i don’t understand why I read so many books. I read a lot but for a disabled adult and schizophrenic (not a lot according to some peeps including some here) but I do read books. I don’t know why though because I don’t apply what I read to the real world and don’t know how to retain that information and get skills or make money. I’m not a fan of reading for ‘fun’ anymore as they cost money and I have little to no means of retaining and making money since 10 years ago. I cannot make money doing nothing and sitting on my ass all day lol. Common sense. I have enough math textbooks (haven’t read them yet) for a complete BS in pure math at a top school. I love PKD but sort of hate fiction and sci-fi. I bought the _PERSON_ foundation book and just tossed it because I couldn’t comprehend fiction and sci-fi and didn’t enjoy it. It’s just fantasy crap and probably peaks my paranoia. I rather read a philosophy book than read about fictional characters. I only read 1 PKD story (
based on a delusion I wrote the story lol) and bought 2 books called “Man in the High Castle” and “Flow my Tears, the policeman said”. _PERSON_ said these two books especially the later might be our dystopian future he wrote about–I was super curious. I felt like I was a time traveler or Illuminati member (based on dreams – I’m now a victim) in another dimension in a past life (long ago) and helped PKD in sort of a terrible, sad, and weird way – possibly not even to my benefit. No proof or evidence of course of me meeting him or my ‘spirit’ meeting him. I even felt I wrote part of the letter and helped him do that Speech in France in the 1970s a bazillion lifetimes ago in another reality. Probably stupid of me to say these things, but I suffered. I feel like I beat PKD in knowing about the simulation and some people or group sent that letter back in time to give credit to him and not to me. The simulators or evil people don’t want us knowing we live in a fake, artificial reality. I don
t care if people believe me or not, but we do – I remember the future!. They didn’t want me getting credit for stuff. I feel robbed and lost all my abilities to take care of myself. I’m sure people are tired of me talking about stuff I did when there’s absolutely no evidence that I achieved remarkable things. I don’t even know how it works. Sounds like _NAME_ crap. My goal is to be a self-made millionaire by the time I die. The money will go to my brother or nieces of course…this wild dream I have if I ever make any money. I really thought I was _USER_ID_ one time or another, but thank God I’m not. I would be worth 50 billion dollars (probably a trillion in the future) and the money is either gone or someone has it and I don’t want it anymore or whatnot. I just wish to be left alone and these delusions are like magic and fire. That and I think the money should go to the government or go to charities of my choosing like _USER_ID_ and companies or non-profits that solve mental health problems l
ike psychosis, bipolar, personality disorders, and definitely schizophrenia. Like I said, I must have been cloned and this feels like a past life or parallel universe or the universe/simulation keeps rebooting like that Australian professor said or I just reincarnated.Yet the information or my creations remain perhaps subconsciously in the minds of the people I meet or their dreams as in the case of PKD. From what I understood the simulation is “totalitarian” in a sense the people or beings that run it are Fascists. I mean the programmers and aliens and such at least the ones I remember interacting with. I guess there’s good ones too. But I’m talking about reptilians. I also heard some aspects of the Illuminati are communists, but some super soldiers say there are branches/factions that are right wing I guess. Basically I think the world is going to end up totalitarian (based on conspiracy theories and the Bible and my dreams). I think people want communism in the simulation and the people/aliens runn
ing the simulation have different ideas: they’re basically nazis. The sad thing is I remember (the best outcome for humanity based on dreams/past life memories) is the British Empire coming back via the “Round Table” and thus us living under some sort of British Rule again and us being Socialist or living under the Monarch/Empire again lol. I often thought the British ran the simulation or ‘won’, but I guess they don’t. They won in the future on planet Earth though in one of my lives and I think that’s why the Queen is so powerful and is the head of the Illuminati under the All Seeing Eye in some photos. These are based on past life memories recalled via my dreams. Like most people, I rather live under Socialism than some super duper Totalitarian dystopia. Even if Socialism leads to communism, I won’t be around that long I think to see it. I remember in one of my lives, the aliens or Illuminati told me they wanted Communism on Mars. It freaked me out and stuff. I hope I don’t trigger people. 
I guess this is my madness and part of my schizophrenic identity."

174382614,"I figured the rates would be high, but I didn’t expect those numbers. So many homeless unmedicated people. I know it’s getting bad in my area, and shelters just don’t have the room for everyone. We have pop up tent towns under bridges and overpass, down by the river, and at the lakes. What do we do? Initialize institutionalization? The shelters and food banks can’t keep up half the time. People are dying due to exposure. Suffering from madness, alone. It’s one of my biggest fears, that I will end up like that."
174382619,I am a 56 year old schizophrenia patient. I was diagnosed with this illness way back in 1988. I was hospitalized and given 7 ECT’s.My overt symptoms subsided but many of my delusions never went away. I have been working as a college teacher for the last 23 years. Whenever I have a fit of anger or my delusions become intense my family feels that I am a bad man and not a sick person. They are reluctant to educate themselves about schizophrenia. They always try to find fault with me. They have no sympathy with me. They aid my anger rather than mitigating it. I feel helpless.
176158428,"I can somewhat relate. As a youth I was in solitary confinement in Juvenile hall because I went in for a violent crime so they kept me out of the general populace. It was an old facility. The room was a white concrete room with a concrete slab where I had a thin mattress on top of that slab. There was nothing to do. It was hellish. It was before the illness thankfully. I started reading books. I read a book nearly everyday. Once I’d been in for awhile they let me go to church services. It was only a total of 28 days there but man it was a horrible experience. I would advise you not to ruminate on the past. Maybe try thinking about the positive things in life instead. I don’t give much thought to my experience with solitary confinement but just thinking about it right now. I feel a lot more comfort realizing that I live in a decent place. I have all the basic necessities and a few luxuries. Things are not so bad. Not the life I would have wanted, but definitely not the worst situation I’ve bee
n in. I remember one time I really had to use the bathroom. We had to press a button and wait for the guards to come in. When I did nobody came. It must have been a couple hours. I ended up peeing in the corner. They still did not come. I think they do things to try to break you like that. I’m not sure if it is because they were busy or were just being jerks. Anyway that was my worst experience there. I’m thankful to have a bathroom I can go to any time."

176158438,i never smoked menthol smokes but i can imagine if you did that this could make you confused.

176158440,Mhmm! The pup from a shelter we adopted 7 years ago.
176158441,I quit in August of last year after smoking years a pack a day. First I switched to gum and then I quit the gum. It’s possible to quit. There is always hope. But I still crave for cigarettes every now and then.
176158442,I think you should aim your energy towards recovery. Not fighting against labels and things you cant solve.
176158443,You are amazing

Then you have the massive sun which is bigger than her, and she’s staring down at this tiny demon. Honestly thats how I feel right now, where a minor bad feeling or thought can seem like the biggest threat to my existence, when I have to look at all the beauty around me. remind myself that good always wins"
176158445,Too much or too little sleep does it for me.
176158446,I work 4 days a week. I manage it quite well but do go off sick a fair bit
176158447,How likely is it?

174382627,"I am still struggling with the concept of being unwell. However, having said that, I decided I needed meds when I started carrying a knife and grabbing it whenever people passed because I was convinced I’d be kidnapped. I memorized car license plates and streets and any detail I could so I could describe it to the police once I escaped. I was so scared all the time. So I decided to get help. My Saphris has really made a difference."

176158456,"Am not much of an expert but I do know two receipts… involves chips, sausages and eggs… Basically, fry the chips and sausages until ready. Then cut up the sausages into little pieces and mix with the chips. After, preheat frying pan with coat of oil and pour the chips mixed with sausages into it, then pour a bowl of mixed egg into the mix wait until eggs are fried into the chips/sausages then flip the fried over to heat the top - side of the eggs… And then it’s ready and you’ll have a fries/sausages/eggs pizza… can heat with tomatoes etc for extra flavour"
176158457,"I have sensory input and beliefs that have no relation to reality. I hear voices, all of them having a unique personality and purpose/function"
176158458,"Yes i got triggers which bring up past traumetic events. But after all it saves me from repeating the same mistake over and over again. When the student is ready the teacher will come. Life repeatedly gives you the same lesson till you learn and move on to the next lesson. Nothing changed in nature. We are still prey and vulnerable to the unknown. It’s scary but you can learn to be one with nature and its nice. Riding one wave after the other. All you need to do is wait and cool off till the next wave comes. Up to you to ride it. It’s optional. It seems you got an procrastination problem. Perhaps it’s time to grow up. You still can be a 16 year old, the other living years are lifeexperience."

176158495,"It’s what you don’t eat that is important. Don’t eat a lot of sugar, cut way down on sugar. Read food labels, sugar is often hidden in products you would never expect: ketch-up, bread etc. Avoid sugar and also avoid too much of the unhealthy fats and unhealthy carbs. Cutting back on sodium is especially important as too much sodium raises your blood pressure. Finding a diet that will fit everyone is just about impossible. It’s why so many diets contradict each other. In the 1970’s the prevailing wisdom for dieting was eating lots of carbs. So the experts told us to eat lots of bread and pasta. Well, now the pendulum has swung the other way and eating a lot of carbs is not the way to lose weight. I don’t have a diet for you except to say; everything in moderation."

But, sometimes the internet does not work or my computer crashes. This has happened twice so far. I have not asked for sick days though since I’ve started. I advise you to not work if you can’t show up. Someone told me no matter what just show up even if you don’t feel like it. I have taken this advice seriously. I sometimes don’t feel up to snuff, meaning I don’t feel well. But, I know I must pay my bills so I work. They can easily replace me. I know this and take my work seriously.

176158503,I made this great painting years ago but it’s been very hard to recapture the magic. When I practice this kind of brushwork I usually fail.

I bought some black aquarium sand and a box. image480×640 84 KB image480×640 62.6 KB image480×640 85.4 KB I’ve been practicing by making patterns with the brush and then shaking the box. I’m hoping this weird learning technique will improve my brushwork. I thought I’d share with the group because it’s straight out of the mind of an SCZ. I’m going to practice for some time and then go back to traditional paint on canvas . . .

I remember falling, beyond time and space. The walls speeding past me as I fell, faster and faster. I was up so high. It took ages. Fire and pressure, points of light all around me…others? I fell until I lost everything. The abilities, the knowledges, the other realms. I…woke up? Physical, biological…living… I had to learn to move and sustain. I began to feel, to experience life, as the old realms faded away like dreams, only flashes left. So what now? Climb back towards pinnacle? Find home again? I’m going to be waiting a long time til the next cycle, I’m worried. This, Human experience is confusing, limiting. It has solid rules of physics and laws. It’s no longer

174382652,"There are 4 categories of males. Category 1: “big shots”, people who are either rich, or influential or famous, or any combination of the above. Category 2: "" regular"" people but reasonably successful ones.

Category 3: people who are considered “normal” but work at low prestige jobs and earn below average income in the countries they live in like cashiers clerks and bus drivers. Category 4: Invalids. These people don’t work, live with their parents and are uncapable of living independently and are often socially isolated.

Vitamin B1 (thiamine) Vitamin D Zinc Folate preferably methylfolate helps to improve mood in low doses. Its easy to have deficiencies especially when take medicines and other substances like alcohol, high calorie diet etc. This is especially true for vitamin B1. Vitamin D can low if not get sunshine enough. Zinc also deficiency is common especially if not eat zinc rich foods and takes lot of copper containing foods like nuts, peas etc. For folate some people can have genetic mutation which makes them hard to absorb folate from food.

176158666,Gosh I hate rap with a passion.
176158667,"Basically, the first time I ever went to see a psychiatrist was late 2018. I have only been to one psychiatrist. At the time I had experienced my first and only major episode. And while I was very disoriented as a result of my condition, I can pretty plainly remember a lot of the details I told my doctor who I was seeing for the first time. During our first few sessions, he had asked a number of questions and had written down notes (as doctors do). I remember him asking about my relationship status at the time, to which I told him I was single, and the last time I had been in a relationship at that point in time was in 2015. For whatever reason, I remember he kept asking a lot of things about my ex from my last relationship. He wouldn’t move on to other things. I very clearly told him that I don’t think my ex boyfriend has anything to do with me being sick. It had been almost 4 years since my last relationship and I had moved on from the person. I think, for reasons I can’t quite comprehend m
y doctor believed I was depressed because of an ex. Even though I had not offered any information about this to start with, and I did not believe it was the case. During a recent session with my psychiatrist, he decided to go through all the notes he had on me from the very beginning, as I had asked what my diagnosis is. As he was telling me the story as it was accounted in his notes, he was like “So there was a boy who you had broken up with. This was the cause for a lot of distress… etc etc.” I was really irked by this because the “boy” was not the cause of any distress or any of my troubles. I did not say this to him. He totally came up with his own narrative and I think its unfair. I sound like I was boy crazy and obsessed with someone to the point of psychosis. This is an inaccurate detail, it bothers me and I would like him to alter it. My question is, is this possible?. I don’t want this to be my story, because it isn’t. If I ask, can he change what is written in my notes?"
176158668,"I can’t function either. I hardly ever cook anymore, I don’t read books like I used to, the only thing I still do regularly is cleaning."
176158669,"Tbh today I feel dumb to not seek more meds, but I did only this for ten years… wasnt this enough to me? But now, I am just a burden to everyone, I am just sick still that’s all… I am sure about the ap, but I think what else could help… tbh, my doc the last time didnt offer nothing else… but maybe cause he saw that I don’t want more meds… maybe it was me… but all the ads made me more paranoid too yeah… what else is left for me then?? Should I accept a bit of pain still then? Who else made this choice if its a choice?? _AT_MENTION_ , how it is about you? Do I sound depressed or you see the negatives in me? How it is for you the others, were you having a lot of pain too but you didn’t want more meds and you ended up by feeling better I hope??? Yeah…"

I deleted all my university study mates, I find them useless. Even non-schizophrenic criminals have some emotions."
174382684,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Efficacy of Valbenazine (NBI-98854) in Treating Subjects with Tardive Dyskinesia and Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder. _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and CF _PERSON_, Psychopharmacology bulletin , 2017 08 01 Valbenazine (VBZ, NBI-98854) is a novel vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD). The KINECT 3 study (NCT02274558) evaluated the effects of VBZ on TD in subjects with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (SCHZ) or mood disorder (mood disorder presented separately) who received up to 48 weeks of treatment.KINECT 3 included: 6-week, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled (DBPC) period (205 completers); 42-week VBZ extension (VE) period (124 completers): 4-week washout period (121 completers). Subjects entering the DBPC were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily VBZ 80 mg, VBZ 40 mg, or PBO; stable concomitant antipsychotic medication regimens were allowed. Subjects completing the DBPC and entering the VE p
eriod were re-randomized (blinded) 1:1 from PBO to VBZ (80 or 40 mg) or continued VBZ treatment at the same dose. Efficacy assessments included: mean changes from baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total score (items 1-7); mean Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-TD) scores; AIMS responders (subjects with ?50% score reduction from baseline): and CGI-TD responders (subjects with score ?2 [""much improved"" or ""very much improved""]). Treatment effect sizes (_PERSON_ d) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were analyzed for DBPC outcomes.Efficacy analyses were conducted in 148 subjects (DBPC) and 125 subjects (VE) with SCHZ. At Week 6 (end of DBPC), AIMS mean score improvements were greater in the VBZ groups (in a dose-related pattern) than in the PBO group (80 mg, -2.9, d = 0.88; 40 mg, -1.6, d = 0.52; PBO, +0.3). AIMS score changes at Week 48 (end of VE) showed continued TD improvement during long-term VBZ treatment (80 mg, -4.2; 40 mg, -2.5). By Week 52 (end of washout), AIMS scores 
were returning toward baseline levels, indicating re-emergence of TD. CGI-TD mean scores were as follows: Week 6 (80 mg, 3.0, d = 0.11; 40 mg, 2.9, d = 0.23; PBO, 3.2), Week 48 (80 mg, 2.2; 40 mg, 2.4), Week 52 (80 mg, 3.4; 40 mg, 3.3). AIMS responder rates (?50% score reduction) were greater with VBZ than with PBO at Week 6 (80 mg, 40.9%, NNT = 4; 40 mg, 26.2%, NNT = 6; PBO, 9.3%), were increased at Week 48 (80 mg, 50.0%; 40 mg, 26.2%), and decreased after VBZ washout (80 mg, 21.6%; 40 mg, 9.5%). CGI-TD responder rates followed a similar pattern: Week 6 (80 mg, 29.5%, NNT = 17; 40 mg, 33.3%, NNT = 10; PBO, 23.3%), Week 48 (80 mg, 73.7%; 40 mg, 58.1%), Week 52 (80 mg, 29.7%; 40 mg, 33.3%).Sustained TD improvements were found in subjects with SCHZ who received up to 48 weeks of VBZ, with TD reverting toward baseline when assessed 4 weeks after treatment withdrawal. Together with results from mood disorder subjects and the long-term safety profile (presented separately), these results indicate that long-term VB
Z can be beneficial for managing TD regardless of psychiatric diagnosis category."

174382692,Yeah working having schizophrenia is a tough one… hearing voices makes it feel like it’s impossible. But hang in there bud… I wished I did. I wished I didn’t flake out on jobs and kept at it.
176158686,I didn’t catch that. Did one of the participants of the video say he or she took 5 mgs. It could be therapeutic for that individual. We all l have different brains.
176158687,I don’t think I could be the same. The first incidents of psychosis in my life was when I was about 15 and it’s been on and off since then. I learned a lot since then!
176158688,Led Zeppelin with beer and a few joints got me through high school. Could have seen the Pink _NAME_ “Animals” concert when they toured in 1977 but I got grounded by my mom that week for an unrelated issue and my friends went without me.

174382691,"If you ever recover from schizophrenia, here’s what will happen after you’ve been recovered without meds for like 5 years. The pdoc will likely rediagnose you not schizophrenic and possibly just residual sz or maybe they will just change it to something else because you recovered. There is a very small minority group of sz that do recover without meds but it’s a very small percentage of them. And also recovery means different things for different people. Diagnoses are very maleable as you go through life and also vary from pdoc to pdoc too. One might say your bipolar another may say sz affective, another might say its DID, another borderline another sz undifferentiated another paranoid sz. And on it goes. One thing my pdoc told me is that she has 2 types of patients. Ones that take there meds everyday religiously. And the other type is the risk taking type that accepts that they may end up in the hospital as a possibility for not being on aps everyday. She put me in the risk taking category. 
I’m ok with it I’ve managed for years like that. But I do have aps as a prn and other meds as prn if necessary. So I still have safeguards in place and other therapies/treatments"

My brain is so sensitive I cant take anything. I’ve been scary for 7 months. I started having very bad reactions to my prescriptions and would get very scared to take them and I am used to living in fear now. I get so scared I become messed up. I bet nothing happens but if it does you will live through it and dont take it again."

174382696,"Sz gets better with age. That of course by being strict about doing your meds and taking them even tho you feel well. I dont believe the cobblers its degenerative. If you take a positive approach you are more than capable of having a normal life, with a wife and kids. Schizophrenia is highly treatable with the right combination of drugs these days."

176158707,"My father taught me to breathe in squares. It gives my mind something else to focus on, and it slows my breathing so I don’t hyperventilate. What you do is find a square to look at. It can be a box or a window or a picture frame, anything. Run your eyes along one side of the square while you inhale. Hold your breath for the next side. Exhale at the third, and hold at the fourth. Repeat until you feel calmer."

176158710,Oh i see - difficult one. Pop a valium if you can some more off the doc. Its annoying when you dont have spares.
176158711,The delusional brain will find “evidence” everywhere and make associations and patterns when in reality there are none. Typically when examined rationally the “evidence” falls apart. But someone with psychosis is often unable to do this because of the strong gut feeling that delusions are true the brain creates. Instead of seeking out evidence that your delusion is true i encourage you to start seeking out evidence it is false.

176158714,I´d say that the more you try the better you will look…
176158715,"Most hospitalization episodes I have seen (I work in a psych hospital) happened because the person quit their meds. The ones that didn’t happen because of that were because it was their first psychotic episode. When you are on meds they help reduce the amount of dopamine normally flooding your brain. Your brain gets used to the meds controlling it and stops maintaining it itself. If you quit meds, you get an overwhelming rush of dopamine to your brain and your brain can’t regulate it because it is used to the meds doing it so it’s even worse than before you were on meds. This causes you to have an episode potentially worse than you had before you were on meds. It is called “rebound psychosis”. Never just abruptly quit your meds. If you have only ever had one episode of psychosis, one day you can try weaning off with your doctors help."

174382694,"Seroquel is notorious for relapse because it takes so long to reach a desired therapeutic effect. It sounds like you are wanting some relief immediately. Sorry I can not be of more help. I take a subclinical dose Seroquel, and I’m glad I have it. I have known folks who told me they take 800 mgs a day of Seroquel. Therefore, your doctor has a lot of room to increase the dosage if desired. When my mind was gone, I worked on myself to take a Pacifist stance. When I was gentle to myself and others, the voices became less aggressive. I assume you crave some peace of mind, and it doesn’t help to be so upset about seeming unacceptible treatment of one’s self. It is the dubious privilege of nonpsychotic people to respond angrily and even violently to what seems injust in their world. My judgment is just too poor. _PERSON_"

176158722,_PERSON_ that one is better than the others because you didn’t raise your voice too much. I am being honest that it doesn’t sound too good when you raise your voice too much. Some are able to raise their voice high while maintaining quality while some can’t. Personally my voice sucks at all volumes and also I don’t even have the ability nor the motivation to make songs.

This supposition could be wrong, of course, from a scientific perspective, but seems reasonable to some people. en.wikipedia.org Brain death Brain death is the complete loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).

Even though it was due to PTSD I still had sz like symptoms so I can at least relate a little bit. I can also relate to not so good experiences with hospitals but I can tell you that they aren’t all like that. I know this because I had multiple hospitalizations at multiple hospitals. Dont give up hope on all of them I assure you, they aren’t all bad. I’m here for you and so is everybody else. If you ever need someone to talk to I’ll listen.

176158790,Were u suicidal before?
176158791,"My parents treat me better now than when I was a child. My mom can’t handle or tolerate kids, so I was the victim of years of trauma. My parents are immigrants and that played a major role in how we communicated or lack thereof. I was taught to take a beating and deal with it by keeping it to myself and so I had no one to turn to. Because we never spoke up people loved and still love my parents because they were good to others, but my mom was extremely cruel towards me and my father was an alcoholic. My father still drinks but not to the point of becoming drunk. It took years of therapy to let go of those images of seeing my father passed out drunk on the porch every night. I love my parents for being mature and owning their mistakes and apologizing. We now have a wonderful relationship."
176158792,Cymbalta is what I take also. Works really well for me. I like it a lot. I hope you do too.

176158794,No problems with decision making when my insight is intact.
176158795,The truth is you’re highly delusional _AT_MENTION_ . No one is out to get you or harm you. Please talk to your doctor immediately or go to the ER where it’s safe. I’m wishing you well.
174382718,_AT_MENTION_ is right. Has she tried Clozapine? It’s an antipsychotic med that works when no other does.
176158796,You statement makes me think on extinction of dinosaur and humans survive or we where on that comet or asteroid or from a diffent planet. Anyways all is for good.

After that i will have a real talk with my son. _AT_MENTION_ , thanks, i really like the idea of such a journal to keep. I will propose that to my mum. And im glad your mum healed from the guilt."

176158802,I dont have an opinion on zyprexa sorry I was never on it. Just wanna wish you the best of luck. Hope your symptoms clear up
174382722,It’s the bane of my existence. I take supplements to help with it. I was on benzos for about a year until I quit them. This is what I’m currently taking 750mg beta alanine & 200mg L-theanine on waking 200mg L-theanine at about 7pm when the stuff above wears off On rare occasions I take 1500mg beta alanine on waking. This gets rid of it completely for about 9 hours. BUT if I do this everyday then I get serious muscle cramps. See if you have any luck with these supplements as it’s definitely safer and better than using booze.
176158803,Can you get a drink of ice water instead? I usually drink water middle of the night to avoid snacking when I can’t sleep.

176158810,"I can relate to almost every post here, it’s funny how unique you think your experience is while you’re deluded but you read other people’s description of what happened and realize that we all had very similar experiences with recurring themes. My biggest delusion was that I thought I was a conduit for the US military and terrorists to talk to one another through telepathy, I thought people at my university were committing suicide to sacrifice themselves to the cause. I was trying to make both sides see the foolishness of war and thought I would eventually receive a nobel peace prize"
176158811,I put this in the diagnosed category purposefully. Funny is I’ve started this more up after the college admissions scandal.

I also stayed on SSRI medication for 6 months now. I started having long walks and some weighted body exercises. I did push myself things to do that I didn’t want to do. I started slowly cooking for myself and for my mom. I did read couple of books to get my mind working again, that helped with my speech of poverty and blank thoughts. I started having a certain routine even though it wasn’t a good one: getting up at certain time, eating breakfast always, have my morning coffee and cigarettes. I avoided my dangerous substances like alcohol, cannabis and others. The only drugs I used was and is caffeine and nicotine.my dog helped with my emotions a lot, I do pet him a lot and give him a lot of attention, but snacks and give him some raw meat.

I also when play runescape I do split screen and watch something interesting on other screen. I also forced myself to go for a run or longer walks. Sat down in nature and relaxed. I STILL use benzodiapines when I have a psychotic episode or panic attack cause AP medication does not protect you all the time. I started here minimum to help my mother with dishes and basic chores. I also started working as a barista and I push myself to keep moving and busy, always cleaning and chatting at the same time (hence this is present after 9 months of my depression and hard flat effect.

176158833,Thanks November!
176158834,I remember all my dreams as well. When I was more psychotic and not on meds it made life extremely confusing because I could not determine what reality was. I spent practically as much time sleeping as awake due to my narcolepsy. It felt like I was living dual lives.
176158835,That’s bad you still get paranoid when going out. Tell your Pdoc and ask for a change to your meds.
176158836,"You aren’t making much sense at this moment. Only call the Police if you feel you are in imminent danger, would be my advice."

174382738,"My life was fragmented, it was never in one piece. I don’t think its pieces will be put together ever. Maybe that’s why they call schizophrenia split mind, they still do in some countries like Japan I think."

174382739,"I think we almost believe the same. It is probably a combination of both to varying degrees. One case more genes, one case more trauma is needed because of less vulnerability. I still keep open the possibility of psychosis without genetic vulnerability, but i think it is often several factors- genes, trauma, drugs, etc."

176158843,"So I’m wondering how much I’m being ostentatious with my posts about myself. I’m trying to keep the momentum of sanity up, but perhaps I should do less talk and more action.

176158844,Hate to see you go _AT_MENTION_ . But good luck to you.
176158845,"I believe THC is the culprit. I can’t function more than 3 weeks on reg weed. I been functioning better than ever since I started vaping CBD flower 6 months ago. I guess your experience was different than mine. No research on cbd flower to show positive or negative effects for people prone to psychosis. My pdoc knows about my use. She doesn’t tell me stop, and she doesn’t tell me to continue… Again, no research. So nobody knows."
176158846,Marijuana never really induced psychosis in me but generally if i started smoking marijuana i would eventually have a psychotic episode
176158847,That being said there are plenty of people with a psychosis dx that are well recovered off meds. I think it is when you get into sz territory that it gets a bit more complicated.

Then during the same trip in one Indian reservation I had delusions that I went through some kind of ‘self-removal’ which made me to understand that my codename was _NAME_ and that I was the KGB _PERSON_, the NSA counterintelligence agent.

A few years later there was a play reading group. 5 people sharing 3 play books was the norm. My worst experience with OT was being sent to do a cookery course during my last inpatient stay.

176158922,"Not one person in my family has really empathized with the situation I’m in. They think the lack of drive and willpower is a personality flaw. I’ve dealt with untreated depression before, and thats reinforced in their minds that I’m lazy leeching off the government. I really want to have it out with them, but I’m also relying on them so its not like I can afford to do that. As far as society goes, I’m doing alright. I don’t really go out enough to have friends, but I’m playing Dungeons and dragons with people and enjoying my time. I don’t really know if the social stuff is a problem for me, I kind of feel like I’m normal in that regard, but then the low drive, the lack of sex drive, and the frequency at which I get fatigued get in the way and then suddenly I feel like maybe there are other parts of the illness that can make social life a problem that aren’t things that directly affect your personality."

I’m a peer coach. Right now I have one client and will get a second when I return to Hawaii from my trip to China. Word is going around that they will give me a third client, too. It is really boosting my confidence and making me want to go to the gym and see people because I just feel better around people as a normal, working person! In the long run, I’d like to make enough to get ssdi instead of ssi. By the end of the year, I’d like to get a car. I find I’m looking forward to the days where I can work. I want to work hard and make some money and feel competent around friends and at my Women’s Support Group. My other goal is to try to loose some weight. Now that I’m earning something, I keep wanting to treat myself when I need to save… I know I harp on about the same ????, but it’s nerve racking to 
end day treatment soon and only have work and support groups to keep me busy. It’s like entering the real world again and I’d like to still keep that same drive and structure to my day that I have now. I also really like the days when I get to come home late, like today.

It lives in utter blackness Searing cold Fearing every creak Raging at empty spaces Weeping and morose Lying on the floor As hours go by Never sleeping Always silently watching Pacing feverishly Knowing every inch Of every floorboard Til its legs burn with fire. The darkness holds it Like a prisoner Like a chained animal Like a monster. But you will never perceive It’s not for your eyes For you will see The beast that grins And laughs The gentle savage You will never know What lurks beneath.

176158949,Thanks _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ . This is the first time I have made this dish. The idea of this came when i was thinking about how soy sauce would go well as a marinade for hard boiled eggs. I put 18 hard shelled eggs in a pot and let boil for 11 minutes. After I peeled the eggs and put them in a container and poured just enough soy sauce to cover the eggs and put 2 tbsp of seasoned rice vinegar. I put something to weigh down the eggs inside the container. I put this inside the refrigerator I read that it take 6 to 12 hours to marinate but I may put it in for longer.

I dont even know where to begin, Ive never coded in Python, I only know C/C++ and Java. Ive been told its easy but thats just one of the many examples of how screwed I am.

174382771,"Hello, Its good to find this forum. Oops long post I have been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, bipolar 1 with psychosis, generalized anxiety disorder (bad). Neuropsych test says deficits in verbal learning, processing and attention. I am a totally different person now. After I got sick I left work, volunteering, a lot of social life and lost all my passion. I have been told I have a vivid imagination, I see illusions a lot, sometimes hallucinations. I feel evil presence at night.That never seems to end. A lot of sz type things but I don’t have sz. I go through bad periods full of fear about being followed, recorded, and surveiled, bugged, etc, but even when not sick a constant recognition that it’s likely happening… but often also recognizing it’s paranoia at the same time when I’m well. (I know it doesn’t make sense). I’m on meds but I think they are making me so tired, unfeeling, and so unmotivated that I can’t shower or live a normal functional routine. It’s th
e worst part. I think it’s causing some ‘negative symptoms’ but problem is it’s been the best antipsychotic I’ve been on, no other side effects, and I’m pretty sure all antipsycgotic I tried have all taken away my motivation anyhow. Vyvanse has helped a little, according to others they see it too. Maybe I have ADHD and they won’t tell me. My psych nurse said in recent two sessions that I has _PERSON_ and I should talk to my PDOC if I want to know more about that (they work together closely). But then next session she said that although she had told me that I have _PERSON_, not to focus on it. (I doubted it any way because I have huge insight, I feel everything that’s going wrong). I said to her that I thought that I had the other diagnoses from before (BP1 etc), and she said ‘yeah that’s probably right and sounds familiar’. It’s like they are hiding something. I suspect they are hiding that I have Alzheimer’s or dementia, it’s in my family. She says no they aren’t hiding anything 
so he is ordering a CT scan to show me apparently. I have good problem solving and other things from my old career in management, social work. *Anyone have schizotypal and BP1 and have brain deficits, have it change who they are, bad motivation?and have some things in common with me? I feel very alone. I hope I can be here with these diagnoses?? I do have things in common, this negative type symptoms but likely from the drugs. I need to hear from others going through this. I wish there was something to relieve me. When does this end? I’m just grateful for a supportive family."

Also, the sleep quality is not very good on Abilify, but I got used on it and it’s still better for me than others which sedated me too much and made me sleep 12h (on Abilify it’s 11h).

176159022,"I would highly recommend you to stay on medication for the rest of your life. If you relapsed this quickly, you most likely have schizophrenia. There is nothing wrong with taking medication and a diagnosis. The more psychotic episodes that happen, the lower your intelligence becomes. You face a very high risk of relapse if you stop medication again."
174382785,"As far as negative symptoms are concerned, I am trying dhea and pregnenolone which were studied double blind and were shown to be effective. Too early to tell. I’ll see if they help or turn me into a woman as far as dhea goes (hopefully not, but it can either increase testosterone or estrogen)."
174382784,For me my blunted affect and all negative symptoms get worse every day. I can notice the change every week. 1 month ago me is better than now and 1 month after me will be likely worse than now. This I noticing from the age I can remember its a slow decline.
174382782,"…neither a person with schizophrenia or a person who have schizophrenia. You may think that I don’t accept my diagnosis or label and, yes, I don’t. It doesn’t mean I don’t take medicines or that I’m not involved in my treatment. I go see my psychiatrist every 2-3 months and, despite I can’t pay for a good therapist right now, if I had the money, I would go to therapy every week or every day if possible. And I wouldn’t do it because I think I have a problem, but because I want my life to get better. When you say to yourself “I’m schizophrenic”, you’re attaching your identity to schizophrenia. You’re practically saying you are schizophrenia. The truth is you’re a human being. When you say “I have schizophrenia” or “I’m a person with schizophrenia” you’re bearing a thing that you didn’t necessarily accept to bear. But you may think “but I have the genes of schizophrenia, then I have schizophrenia.” You should notice that there are no enough evidences to sa
y that schizophrenia is really a genetic “disease.” Even it was true it is genetic, DSM-V would diagnose you not by your behaviours, but by a DNA test. Scientists can’t conclude nothing yet. But even if you believe it’s genetic, epigenetics have proofs you can change your genes. That’s why I just say I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It doesn’t mean I’m this disease or that I have this disease, but just that a crazy psychiatrist thought I was crazier than him."
176159023,"I worked in EMI homes for a bit - just before i got diagnosed. But its people like us that have lived thru it, that makes us able to “suss out” people way before they see a shrink.

Endless eye floaters and blurry vision especially around lights. Constant ringing in the ears. Racing weird bizzare thoughts and anxiety. Fear of everything and inability to take anything for what it is. I can’t feel joy anymore in anything because i keep searching for a deeper meaning or hidden plots. Please help I think I’m the first person ever to go through something like this and medication would only make it worse
174382815,_AT_MENTION_ I think that the causal link of connecting sobriety to sz is rather tenuous. Are you suggesting that most alcoholics who are sz give up alcohol because of sz? What about alcoholics who give up drink and aren’t sz? It doesn’t work as a theory as such. It is more likely looking on the bright side and trying to find something positive in sz that was purely coincidental. Giving up drugs and drink made his life better. This may or may not have happened with or without sz.

You get free meds free case management and free psychiatrist. My approval only took a week then I was instantly covered. You should look into programs like that. I wish you the best of luck. Also as someone mentioned some docs will have sample of medication they can give for free. Also check out GoodRx for coupons on medications.

176159132,No a delusion of persecution means you think someone or something is out to get you. Paranoia is like being very afraid of something or very suspicious. You got it backwards in your example there.
176159133,"That’s true. No one knows the exact cause of it. whether it’s a virus in the womb or genetics or whatever but things like drugs and life decisions aren’t going to be the cause, although they can bring out symptoms. There’s nothing you could have done in your life to prevent schizophrenia. There are things you can do to calm the symptoms though…like avoiding stress. There is a whole chapter on the theories of the causes."
176159134,No way. For psych disorders it’s totally irresponsible as _AT_MENTION_ has pointed out. We lose way too many people as it is and saying it’s an option isn’t kind nor reasonable.
176159135,"Elbows up, side to side lol. Def swaying while standing."
176159136,So a couple of months ago I left work and went sick because I got paranoid thinking my colleagues were laughing at me. I told my manager I am feeling paranoid… I told her I know it is irrational and it might not be true at all… but I am feeling that I am not wanted in the workplace… and while the guy in question was not doing anything I was feeling uncomfortable. I felt ashamed and guilty over my thoughts ever since. I could have lost this guy his job if I put in a proper complaint. I decided I will quit the job because I did something terrible… But I thought I would wait until lockdown lifts to tell my manager I am not coming back… But you know what? What have I done? I acted on a feeling and told my manager I was scared and also said I know I am being irrational… I basically told her I am not feeling well and needed time off cos it would not be fair for me to stay there and think those things about other people… So why do I feel guilty? I changed my mind… luckily I never handed in 
my resignaiton letter… I am goinng back next week. I am not going to quit another job because my anxiety got the better of me. I need to face this not run again.
176159137,No one tells me that so I do somethin quite often.

174382818,"This is the second topic I’m making today, but right now I’m really confused. So I was given an Abilify Maintena 400 mg injection and thought that right after the first day it would start to clear out, you know, according to the elimination half-life of 46.5 days. But then I read about an absorption half-life and now I think that a drug has to be at first fully absorbed, reach Cmax (maximum concentration) and then there is an elimination half-life going on. I couldn’t find any information on the Tmax (time to reach maximum concentration) of just one single Abilify Maintena injection, I’ve found out that after the steady state (4 injections) it’s 7 days, but nothing about a single injection. I’ve read that for Maintena the average absorption half-life is about 28 days. Then I read that “An approximate way to predict Tmax is at 3 times the absorption half-life”. So does that mean that only after 84 days, when it reaches 400 mg, the elimination of the drug starts to happen? That really 
bothers me and makes me kind of sad that this might be true. Please, enlighten me."

I lived off 40-100 bucks a month. When you have less money, you tend to spend it better and do better in some cases."

176159258,"It’s been a year since my first psychotic episode. I am very apathetic about every thing. I used to be a very engaged person. I would write poetry and short stories, I _NAME_ and painted, I used to love blogging and hiking. Now I can’t do any of that. I simply have no desire. When I try I feel no enjoyment. It’s as if I’d be better off at home doing nothing. But I force myself to try. I go out shopping with my family. Occasionally I’ll paint or _NAME_ a sketch. I even have two part time jobs, one of them working as a clinic assistant in a women’s health facility. I keep busy but nothing is satisfying. It’s like life has no point. I’m going through the motions with no pay off and it’s tiring. I fear the rest of my life will be like this. Does anyone else have this problem? Has anything helped? My therapist thinks that adding a new medication may give me a slight bump in motivation that could make things easier but I m very doubtful. Maybe I am just stuck in a self limiting belief l

176159259,That’s more than fair… it’s my coffee; I have this belief that it makes me feel good and doesn’t make me feel jittery or bad when I come down off of it. But I’ll take your comment to heart.

Just looking for some insight."
176159263,"I was pretty psychotic and insane for two` solid years. I had nothing going for me, my life mainly consisted of suffering and trying to keep my sanity. I could have easily just given up and killed myself. But I got through it, as impossible as it was, and now I’m so happy I stuck around. I got way better and had many great experiences and I have many great memories. You may not he able to see the light at the end of the tunnel but it’s there. People get better. I got better. You have a chance to get better too."

176159275,"_AT_MENTION_ sounds like you need somebody to talk to about this. I think it is still the best most free country there is. With problems yes. With freedoms abridged by too many laws, yes. But isn’t the government taking care of the disabled? No body is telling you what to do, except between the lines. Business laws in Calif. are atrocious and my hobby is severely threatened. I like it here and don’t want to live anywhere else. Do you have a favorite place? Canada is a good place too. I always wanted to live on a desert island in the Pacific. But I get lonely. Real America may be a thing of the past, but so are the hard ships of the past. They seem to be trying but there is not enough money going around. I don’t mean to jam your feelings but jumped on the chance to express mine. It is only my opinion."

Just like my psychiatrist said - it will be the same. My manager at the studio says I am only at the beginning so I shouldn’t worry so much - she is my friend and she knows that I have sz. However, I am used to be ahead of others. And now I am pathetic - I have to be explained few times, while the younger ppl at the studio get it right away. I wonder if it’s worth it to quit my current job - at least I got used to it. I read something similar here - exercise and eat well…I can’t do it on regular basis. I wish I could… Anyways…this too shall pass…"

I have disinterest in everything like being awake and experiencing anything, plus I’m sleepy for 6 hours a day. I was terribly sick for 6 hours a day for half a year until I made a dosage cut. I am super sensitive and go into a crisis trying to take more of my dose at night and when I threw up a dose."
176159280,It happened to me laying down on the couch. So it’s possible you might be experiencing it sitting down. Have you talked to your doctor about this yet?

176159295,"I am sad and angry with my parents. I dont want to be, cause my mum is ill, but i am. They took in my son years ago, without a court decision. That was okay at the time, because i was unstable. But they now prevent him from sleeping at my house or increasing the visitation program. They tell the child psychologist all the time that my son doesnt want that, but he bags me everyone to stay to sleep. They are very controlling and even frustrate things like me putting him to bed in the evening when i am at their place. Irony is my son first came to live with them because i got borderline psychotic when my mum threatened me. I think it is nice they take care of him, but i would have rather had that he stayed somewhere else, if im honest to myself."

Yes I understand weed is out there in our community and it’s not a big thing with most populations or countries these days but it’s still a major issue here for those who suffer. You are complaining about loss of function and it’s probably the weed that isn’t helping. I would seriously consider stopping and move from there. I’m shutting this down because it’s no different to me than managing alcohol abuse. It’s still a problem that is legal in our communities.

176159381,when I try to save more it’s like expenses just keep popping up. it’s so hard to spend less. it’s good that you have a thriving social life though. one thing in my recovery that I haven’t been able to figure out is to be more social and how to have more of a social life. maybe to cut spending you can find some free things to do with people? not sure what the options are around you though
174382862,I’m having terrible anxiety from my thoughts saying terribly scary things I don’t believe in or would ever do. I am usually in the hospital when it gets real bad. Just got the abilify maintenance shot on November 22nd and another on the 20th of December. I struggle everyday with these intrusive voices. Wondering if abilify is even gonna work. It’s been 5 weeks. Shouldn’t I have relief by now??
176159382,My sza was very gradual. At 13 started being very anxious and the voices started faintly. At 16 my moods started swinging intensely. Only at 18 was my breakdown.

176159389,"_AT_MENTION_ Thank you so much for that! So far I am able to get along fine and am actually enjoying myself more at work. Not sure if I should disclose more to others then or just watch it myself? There’s such an hysteria around psychosis. Plus I find compelling that trauma causes psychosis and it seems like my family/long time friends won’t face the effects of the trauma I’ve suffered (want to dismiss it as an illness instead). Yes, I agree to avoiding street corners or jail! I’ve been in the latter and almost the former (was evicted but in the hospital at the time). Any other suggestions or advice?"
176159390,"I think that this pandemic becomes worse before it gets better. Finland has already five corona deaths, bars, restaurants, cafés will be closed and the area (southern Finland) where there are most corona cases will be isolated from the rest of Finland. In my little town we have not had any corona cases, but I worry that it is just the matter of time when we have also some corona cases. I am really worried. I know the situation here is not as bad as it is in Italy, Spain, NYC and London. We still have a lot of food and drinks at grocery stores, I am afraid this situation becomes worse."

It’s saying on the alkaline water machine that the ORP is -650 but when I measure it with a proper ORP meter it only ends up being -250. That’s much better than the +250 reading of neutral tap water. I’m doing okay-ish. Occasional flareup here and there when I get too testy with my diet (like yesterday I ate a bunch of oreos and tried wheat bread for the first time in a while, and the feeling in my head was irritated enough that I had to take Haldol PRN. If I stay on my low sugar / low fat, wheat / dairy free diet, I’m okay. Good enough to work even."
176159393,I recently became vegan but put on five kg. I am 160cm and weigh 59kg. This time last year I was 53kg but had to eat such tiny amounts of food to be that weight. I had belvita breakfast biscuits for breakfast and a weightwatchers bar and fruit for lunch and a normal dinner. Admittedly I have the started having vegan ice cream and cake on weekends. I love eating and I want to have a healthy appetite and weight. I think I still have a normal bmi but before medication I used to be pretty small naturally. I immediately gained weight and started eating more as soon as I joined the gym . I only go two or three or one time a week mainly to do pump. Being vegan is still new to me and it’s so expensive. Still trying to figure out what to eat. I’m not such a good cook and like to keep it pretty simple. I would like to lose five kg or so at least but don’t want to be eat too little specially not since I’m vegan now. Maybe start by cutting back on the vegan cake. Exercise makes me gain weight because I 
eat more when I exercise. When I did not exercise I ate less and was skinnier.
176159394,I used to have a real cat that really helped me. She would look out after me. Like one time I had taken too much medication and i was out of my bed downstairs during the night and the cat went to wake up my mum and then she came to check me out.
176159395,I’m so happy for you _AT_MENTION_ ! How exciting!
174382872,That is correct.
176159396,I’m good at learning languages and singing.
176159397,"The methodological aspect of your question is easily answered: we’re constrained by language, as _PERSON_ famously put it “the limits of my language are the limits of my world”. So a “we” rather than an “I” would be a good tentative first approach. On a more ontological level, it begs the question to limit (or wantonly expand) the predicament and topology of this “I”. How do we reconcile a solipsist self with the apparent reality of other minds? In other posts I have advanced some possible answers. The important thing is that for a class of mentally ill people supposedly plagued by issues of “self-disturbance” solipsism provides plenty of foundational ground."
174382874,"PubMed Association Between Serum Folate Levels and Schizophrenia Based on Gender -... Our findings suggest that (1) a low serum folate level may be associated with schizophrenia regardless of gender, and (2) folate administration may be beneficial for the treatment of schizophrenia. In schizophrenic patients with low serum folate... I take 400MCG a day as a while back my level was low."
176159398,"I can tell my libido is back because I’m starting to get that feeling like the demons are going to attack me when I dont orgasm every day again. It’s not really an easy to describe feeling…it’s like someone nudging you repeatedly and you do your best to ignore it because you know if you acknowledge them the person is going to mentally, sexually and physically abuse you for hours but the nudging is so persistent and annoying and you can’t help but end up engaging just so it stops and you can have some peace once the hell ends. But I haven’t experienced the hallucinated abuse in a veeeery long time now. Since before I started dating my boyfriend so at least 6 months if not longer. So hopefully I won’t experience it now and this feeling will just pass. The other night it did and nothing happened so that’s good."
174382876,"IDK _AT_MENTION_ . If they planned to treat schizophrenia with psilocybin I would think it’s a horrible idea. But treating depression with them, I wouldn’t know enough to say if it’s a good idea or not. The FDA must have some pretty strong evidence that it works. For me, yes, mushrooms seemed very similar to LSD. They last about half as long and it was a more of a mellow high which some people use as an excuse to use them. Many people used the argument that magic mushrooms are organic and natural in nature so that makes it alright to take them. I really don’t know if the FDA is right about using psilocybin for depression. After all, back in the fifties, many thought that lobotomies were the ultimate cure for some types of mental illness. Researchers were wrong about that so I guess the FDA could be making a mistake here. Who knows?"

On my good days, I get what you experience, it’s been part of a normal experience for me now BUT last Saturday I started taking a supplement called Active Mind. It worked like I seeing everything from a new light, noticing everything around me. Totally attentive. First amazing feeling I’ve had in 10yrs, the 10yrs everything declined with the awareness to my environment. I feel like that active mind stuff was speeding me up although it enhancee cognitively, I got major headaches and didn’t even ask my pdoc about it so I stopped taking it. Now my bf is back to repeating himself, although now I’m used to this feeling after realizing the latter is worse Just so you know I sympathize and your not alone"

I was born in _NAME_ Egypt but came from a Syrian father and an Italian Mother. When I was 1 month old we moved to Lebanon and lived there for 11 months. From there we moved to the United States and made America our home. I consider myself a proud American. But I’m also proud of my immigrant roots. By the way I have an Albanian last name.

176159431,"I think the drug companies are pretty good about cutting people some slack if they can’t afford their drugs. Also, there is a card you might find in a medical office or some other office that can get you an 80% discount on some drugs. I found one in a hospital office where they took an x-ray of my knee. They had it sitting out by the welcome window. Also, when the drugs first come out they are much more expensive than after they go generic. I think Haldol costs pennies. If they want to put me on that drug again they’re going to have to catch me first, and I can be pretty illusive. Geodon is has gone generic. I think Seroquel has too. Zyprexa has probably gone generic. I don’t know how much this is bringing the price of these drugs down, but I think the price is on a downward spiral."

174382908,"I finished my exam, and now I’m more free. I spent most of my night embroidering and in bed. I had so much work today, and today was a long day. I am a bit worried about the exam as the questions were difficult. I hope I didn’t fail it entirely. Anyway, I’m preparing for the unknown. I’m moving to Canada to finish my degree, which I am excited about. I hope to change my degree so that I could work with kids who has mental health issues, or kids with disabilities. It would be a cool profession to have. But I’m worried about my health going out of control if I start my studies. I’m sure that’s not likely to happen. My mom keeps maintaining that schizophrenia is shameful and it should never be talked about. So, my parents maintain that I should keep it secret from my brother. So, I wrote him a long letter (which I will update once in a while) explaining everything from start to finish, just in case I die from dilated cardiomyopathy, a heart condition that I have a high risk of having. I 
have heart problems occasionally which right now is not bad. But it could happen any day. If I die one day, he would get a chance to read it. I’m worried about him blaming my parents but it wouldn’t be fair for me to not tell him. But otherwise I love life and will keep doing so, seeing the good side of everything, notice small things that makes me happy, and be grateful. During the few days that I’ve been gone, I realized that I was missing gratitude. I’m going to keep being grateful even though my heart is telling me to self-distruct. Sending good thoughts to you guys!"

I’ve tried all the atypicals except Rexulti, Fanapt, and Caplyta and I doubt I can switch antipsychotics at this point for various reasons, except for the fact that Caplyta’s NMDA, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sedative effects (as I have intractable insomnia from the Nardil) may be good for me. I’ve tried Sarcosine already, and it made my agitation and anxiety much worse, even at around 0.5 g a day. I’ve tried ashwagandha (both KSM-66 and Sensoril) but the alpha antagonist effects of it worsen my ADHD. I’m looking at glycine now, but I haven’t been able to figure o

I got the whole sz diagnosis but the whole thing that holds me back is the BPD diagnosis - you’re too needy, too emotional, too manipulative. Really? I thought I was just being empathetic & caring - I don’t understand why you just cancelled out on me. Am I really so psychotic & apart from the reality you live in? That hurts. Private message me if you want to talk more on, “how to relate to people & how to get to know people”. I’m in my mid-forties so I get how to relate to people even if that means faking who you are to gain their trust and admiration. Believe me, I’ve done it many times before - you can do it too, the question is do you want to do it just to be accepted?

176159519,"Hello again, it’s been awhile, I’m not doing so good. My depression is very bad and my psychiatrist says its treatment resistant depression. I’m taking 300mg effexor, 300mg lyrica, 10mg abilify and 5mg of zprexa. I do not have schizophrenia but some days I actually think I do. My diagnosis is somataform disorder, anxiety and depression. I’m swollen as well from the meds. I am not improving, but just recently started on zyprexa. My psychiatrist doesn’t want to mess around too much with the meds. I’m due to see a psychologist to talk about my complex past. This illness has taken an awful lot out of me, I’m just not myself and haven’t been these past four years, with the depression worsening considerably these last two years. Some days, I believe I have schizophrenia and other days I believe I have MS. I’m in terrible fear and on edge a lot. No psychiatrist says I have schizophrenia but I wonder are the meds playing tricks on my mind? I’m treble the size I was, plus swollen looking
, that’s the meds and the sedentary lifestyle I suppose. I’m perhaps delusional as well. So tired and slow, not sure what I’m doing, clumsy and awkward, dont want to be around people, self care gone bad, my illness affects everything. Does schizophrenia cause symptoms like mine? I am fearful I am developing schizophrenia. That’s what I’m thinking right now. I’m trying my best to stay positive and fight it all, but its draining daily. I remain hopeful though of recovery because things cant get much worse I hope, and I fear this treatment resistant depression as well. My psychiatrist says if zyprexa doesn’t work, lithium should work and she may try me on that, although close monitoring will be needed on that med. Have any of you tried lithium? Is it good for depression if nothing else works. I definitely think my physical symptoms are causing a lot of my depression, but it’s really bad now for two years with no real lift at all. My psychiatrist says it’s like trying to restart a battery with m
e, trying to find the right combination of meds and therapy. I know a lot of help is needed from myself too, like doing walks, trying to socialize, listening to the radio, anything to distract my racing thoughts. I am trying. I’m just very sad and even feeling sorry for myself:( Things are very difficult which is why I’m wondering what’s going on with me. I’m scared of my illness. I hope to get better, but something is definitely very wrong with me. Anyone here think it sounds like schizophrenia? I do not hear voices or hallucinate but my thoughts race all day, fearful thoughts. Thanks"

174382917,"People exposed to a lifetime of psychosocial adversity may have an impaired ability to produce the dopamine levels needed for coping with acutely stressful situations. These findings, published today in eLife , may help explain why long-term exposure to psychological trauma and abuse increases the risk of mental illness and addiction. “We already know that chronic psychosocial adversity can induce vulnerability to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression,” explains lead author Dr. _NAME_, Excellence Fellow and leader of the Translational Psychiatry Research Group at University College London, UK. “What we’re missing is a precise mechanistic understanding of how this risk is increased.” To address this question, Dr. _PERSON_ and his colleagues used an imaging technique called positron emission tomography (PET) to compare the production of dopamine in 34 volunteers exposed to an acute stress. Half of the participants had a high lifetime exposure to psychosocial stress, while th
e other half had low exposure. All of them undertook the Montréal Imaging Stress Task, which involved receiving criticism as they tried to complete mental arithmetic. Two hours after this stress task, the participants were injected with small amounts of a radioactive tracer that allowed the scientists to view dopamine production in their brains using PET. The scans revealed that in those with low exposure to chronic adversity, dopamine production was proportional to the degree of threat that the person perceived. In people with high exposure to chronic adversity, however, the perception of threat was exaggerated whilst their production of dopamine was impaired. The researchers found that other physiological responses to stress were also dampened in this group. For example, their blood pressure and cortisol levels did not increase as much as in the low-adversity group in response to stress. “This study can’t prove that chronic psychosocial stress causes mental illness or substance abuse later in life by l
owering dopamine levels,” Dr. _PERSON_ cautions. “But we have provided a plausible mechanism for how chronic stress may increase the risk of mental illnesses by altering the brain’s dopamine system.” “Further work is now needed to better understand how changes in the dopamine system caused by adversity can lead to vulnerability towards mental illnesses and addiction,” adds senior author _NAME_, Professor of Molecular Psychiatry at MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences and King’s College London, UK. _NAME_, The effects of psychosocial stress on dopaminergic function and the acute stress response, eLife (2019)."

174382902,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Lithium augmentation fails to reduce symptoms in poorly responsive schizophrenic outpatients. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of clinical psychiatry , Jun 1999 Nearly one third of patients suffering from schizophrenia do not fully respond to antipsychotic medication. Safe, effective, and cost-efficient methods to reduce symptoms are clearly needed; therefore, lithium as an adjunct to fluphenazine decanoate was tested in a placebo-controlled trial in outpatients who were part of the Treatment Strategies of Schizophrenia (TSS) study.Forty-one patients with DSM-III schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were assigned to either adjunctive lithium or placebo after at least 6 months of fluphenazine decanoate treatment to stabilize symptoms had failed. The trial was designed for 8 weeks of treatment, and patients assigned to placebo could afterward be administered lithium in an 8-week, open-label study.Assessment 
of the intent-to-treat analysis revealed no significant differences in demographic variables between the lithium and placebo groups. Although both groups showed significant (p = .00135) improvement as measured by total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), there were no significant differences in response between the lithium and placebo groups. Patients originally treated with placebo added to neuroleptic did not have significantly greater improvement when receiving open-label adjunctive lithium.Although success with lithium augmentation therapy for persistent psychosis has been reported in the past, this study of well-characterized patients showed no benefit for this common strategy, thus indicating that care be used in utilizing lithium augmentation. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Lithium and psychosis revisited. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry , Feb 1998 1. Using differential response to medications may help in resolving the central problem of heterogene
ity of the psychoses, 2. A distinct subgroup of patients with a lithium responsive, nonaffective psychosis has been shown to have their core psychotic (nonaffective) symptoms respond to lithium alone. 3. The family histories of patients with lithium responsive, nonaffective psychoses suggests that there is less genetic loading for this subgroup of patients. 4. Research on the prodromal adjustment of lithium responsive, nonaffective psychosis patients has not been reported. 5. Lithium responsive patients showed significantly fewer negative symptoms than did those patients with a nonaffective psychosis who did not respond to lithium. 6. Patients with lithium responsive, nonaffective psychoses showed more extreme in vitro lithium ratios in the red blood cells and significantly less of all types of phospholipid methylation. 7. Patients with lithium responsive, nonaffective psychoses showed significantly greater reduction in symptoms during a physostigmine challenge test, but results from apomorphine challenge tes
ts could not be replicated. 8. Aside from differential response to lithium, research on difference in treatment response and outcome for this group has not been reported. 9. Preliminary evidence may suggest that lithium responsive, nonaffective psychosis is a phenocopy of other psychotic disorders that is not associated with ventriculomegaly but is associated with stimulant abuse. 10. Lithium's effects on acetylcholine as well as effects on dopamine and serotonin may explain its efficacy with this subgroup of patients. 11. This review supports the existence of a distinct subgroup of patients with nonaffective psychoses who may have a separate disorder, but further research is necessary. 12. Lithium responsive nonaffective psychosis appears to be a separate, distinct psychotic phenocopy. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The etiologic heterogeneity of schizophrenia. _PERSON_, Harvard review of psychiatry , Mar-Apr 1997 Evidence is increasing in support of the etiologic heterogeneity of schizophrenia. Five distinct diseases/dis
orders are suggested in this paper, and the relevant studies are reviewed. Familial forms of the disorder include a dopamine psychosis (supported by research documenting both altered dopamine activity and early neuroleptic response among some schizophrenic patients), a neurodegenerative psychosis (supported by investigations that document ongoing change in ventricular brain ratio, elevation of products of cell membrane catabolism within the central nervous system, and age-progressive third ventricle enlargement accompanied by delayed response to neuroleptics), and a neurodevelopmental psychosis (supported by evidence of static enlarged ventricles in some schizophrenic patients and neurological soft signs in high-risk offspring of schizophrenic individuals). Nonfamilial forms include a neurodevelopmental psychosis (supported by evidence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities triggered by neurotropic viruses, radiation, or anoxia) and a lithium-responsive psychosis (supported by evidence of a subgroup of psychotic 
patients who have low risk of either psychosis or mania in their pedigrees and respond to lithium). ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A family study of lithium-responsive psychosis. _PERSON_, BE _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of affective disorders , Sep 1990 Psychiatric life histories of 487 first-degree family members of 24 lithium-responsive (mood-incongruent) psychotics, 54 lithium-nonresponsive (mood-incongruent) psychotics, and 18 lithium-responsive patients with bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder were contrasted. While the morbid risk of schizophrenic-spectrum was 11.1% in relatives of lithium-nonresponsive probands, the morbid risk for such disorders was only 2.4% in relatives of lithium-responsive (mood-incongruent) psychotics (P less than 0.05). This lithium-responsive illness appears to be familially, and perhaps genetically, distinct from the bulk of the schizophrenias. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Psychosis, lithium-induced antipsychotic response, and seasonality. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research , Dec 1988 Lithiu
m alone has previously been shown to effect antipsychotic response in approximately one-quarter of mood incongruent psychoses. Such lithium-responsive psychoses and/or the antipsychotic effects of lithium appear to be seasonal, with maximal response rates occurring in the 3-month periods surrounding January and July peaks. Within patients, retrials of lithium in formerly lithium-responsive psychotic patients demonstrate a trend toward greater continued antipsychotic effects of lithium during the periods surrounding January and July (80% response rates) vs. the remaining 6 months of the year (33% response rates). ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Severe akathisia causing neuroleptic failure: an indication for lithium therapy in schizophrenia? A _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica , Dec 1987 Several neuroleptics recurrently failed to ameliorate psychosis in three schizophrenic patients. Failures were caused by recurrent intractable akathisia, unresponsive to diazepam and trihexyphenidyl. Lacking this 
extrapyramidal side effect, lithium carbonate was tried and proved an effective antipsychotic. It is suggested that in schizophrenic psychosis lithium is a rational therapeutic option in cases of neuroleptic intolerance and failures due to akathisia. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Lithium response and psychoses: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and PE Djuric, Psychiatry research , May 1984 Lithium-associated remission of psychosis has been described in schizophreniform disorders and in psychotic patients with variants of the red blood cell (RBC)/lithium ratio. To determine whether such remissions are the consequence of lithium treatment rather than spontaneous in nature, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in 16 psychotic patients preselected for the variant of RBC/lithium ration and/or DSM-III schizophreniform diagnosis. Essentially full and sustained remission of psychosis began during periods of lithium treatment in 4 of 15 of the study patients. Improvement was 
significantly greater during lithium treatment periods than in counterbalanced placebo treatment conditions in these four subjects (p less than 0.02). Fifteen of the same 16 study patients failed to initiate sustained improvement either spontaneously or while on placebo during the initial 14-day treatment period. In this preselected psychotic population, sustained response to lithium occurred at a rate at least four times greater than that which could be attributed to spontaneous remission. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Impact of lithium therapy on core psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science , Jan 1984 The authors have previously reported that a sub-group of schizophrenic-like patients respond favorably to lithium therapy: furthermore, psychotic patients who respond to lithium demonstrate appreciable improvement during the first seven days of treatment. The present study investigated which symptoms of schizophrenia i
mproved quickly during lithium treatment. We found that patients who do respond to lithium show significant improvement in the core symptoms of psychosis--hallucinations, delusions and formal thought disorder--during the first seven days of treatment, thus allowing early identification of 88 per cent of schizophrenic patients who ultimately respond to lithium and 91 per cent of those who do not."

Which reminds me too much of certain interactions in life where people feel like they’re pushing you away because you’re “bad” or “needy” or something… I’ve seen men stand up when they were otherwise paralyzed or walk when they had bad knees (a study of faked knee surgery) and depression can feel like this some days. Ugh… I feel like I could rant forever. Just for me I tend to take it too personal when I hear stuf
f like this. It’s like, “I’m human damnit! And sometimes life and the circumstances are just… crap!”"

And plus our percentage is so low in population thats why they can not say we are public health problem according to who. So every actions against our patients right is illegal as long as we are on medication.

176159556,"I would simply call up the college you’re interested in and ask them if they have some kind of disabled students services. I’ve been to two community colleges that have these and I bet many other colleges do too. If they have a disability department then call it up and ask for information and see what kind of help they give. They may ask you to come in person for information though. One disability office I went to helped me by registering right there in their office, thus avoiding long lines. The counselor helped me pick classes and they paid for all fees except the cost of each unit I took. They are confidential too. The counselors in the disability office are just like regular counselors you might see but they are trained to work with disabled people. I don’t know all the accommodations but I know that they can arrange for you to take tests alone in a classroom so you have no distractions and they will also arrange with your teacher to give you more time than usual to take quizzes and tests
. I would just talk to them, it’s good to register for those accommodations even if you don’t use them because they are a safety net in case you get behind in a class or run into other trouble. I’m not positive but I’m pretty sure that if the office notifies your teacher that you need accommodations that they won’t disclose your diagnosis. So it wouldn’t hurt anything to just talk to the disability office and get an idea of what they offer in the way of help."

I was actually supposed to schedule an appointment with the latter at the beginning of this month, but family stuff got in the way.

The pieces are on the ground which is what shes looking at. I’ll also make her crying. This piece is a way for me to represent a loss of innocence and childhood. The original event that caused my PTSD happened in 5th grade. Chaos ensued after. Because of the PTSD I cant really remember anything from the beginning of my life until about halfway through 10th grade. I’m a senior now and lament at the chunk of time that I’m missing. Due to everything that happened after the event and my symptoms and such I wasnt able to be normal and any normal experiences I could have had were ripped away from me. 11th grade was when I could finally live and do things. Then this year hit and that went away cause of Covid but it is what it is. That’s why I’ve put so much time into that one. It’s a highly emotional piece for me

176159666,"Pretty much the same thing is happening to me right now. I’ve been going downhill, symptom-wise, for about a month now. I was pretty stable for about… 8 months, maybe? Maybe more. But then I had a really bad breakthrough of depression in February. My hallucinations have been getting worse. I went back to a steady mood for three months, and then I went into hypomania. Then severe depression. Now hypomania again with more voices. I just very recently started a new antipsychotic. Literally, last night. Lol. I’m hoping I’ll get stable again soon. Good luck, _PERSON_."

176159669,Delusions from PD is more like “I’m the worst person on this earth and I hate myself” kind of thing. It really disfigures your identity and your self-perception. You keep thinking everyone hates you. So you end up attempting suicide because you think you’re not worth it.
174382960,"Does anyone else have early childhood-onset schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder? I have schizoaffective d/o and my psychosis started at age 10 or 11. I didn’t know I had psychosis; I just felt like my peers were experiencing the same things I was. I started believing there were people inside my head who watched me and I had to play music for them to “start them up” and get them inside my head. I wanted them to see my life because I was sure that they would not think I was a bad person if they saw that I was trying my best. I also started believing that the television and radio were sending me subliminal messages, making me a bad person, so I stopped watching current T.V. and movies and I stopped listening to current radio at the time. As you can imagine, I did not know anything about current media when I was 11 so my peers thought I was weird. I didn’t start becoming depressed until age 12. I got diagnosed for the depression first, because that was the most apparent of the two to ever
yone else. I’m not sure when I was properly diagnosed with psychosis or SZA, but I started on my first anti-psychotic med when I was 15. If you had this very early onset psychosis, did you realize something was wrong then or later? How did your illness impact your life then?"

176159675,"I do have what I think _PERSON_ referred to as social insight, I understand perfectly well why others might think that I’m crazy,which is more than many normies can say.

176159801,I was a security guard so I was the clown among the staff. The ‘smelly’ thing was nurses getting pissy about me using one of the break rooms after doing rounds about the hospital and getting all sweaty. As for ‘avoiding’ …I avoided them; felt that most came from early Gen X - the kids that made fun of poor people who had to shop Kmart instead of _NAME_’s. Sometimes it better to hang out alone rather than in the center of sneers.

I’m not able to tolerate other SSRIs too. I start crying after taking 1st dose of any SSRI/SNRIs. Maybe the crying will go away eventually if i hospitalize myself.

174383001,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The Gut Microbiome and Treatment-Resistance in Schizophrenia. MV _PERSON_, The Psychiatric quarterly , Nov 28 2019 The effect of antipsychotic medication is poor in 30-40% of patients with schizophrenia; treatment resistance is usually met with shifts to new drugs or drug augmentation strategies or a trial of clozapine. The purpose of this review was to examine the potential role of intestinal bacteria in the bioavailability of antipsychotic medication and the possibility that parenterally administered antipsychotics might be able to overcome treatment resistance. Databases were searched with appropriate terms to locate relevant papers dealing with the effect of antipsychotic drugs on the gut microbiome and the effect of bacterial metabolizing enzymes on antipsychotic drugs. Also searched were papers addressing the various current parenteral formulations of antipsychotic drugs. Sixty-five recent pertinent papers were reviewed and the results are suggestive of the premise that there 
is a drug refractory form of psychosis for which the composition of gut bacteria is responsible, and that parenteral drug administration could overcome the problem. Possible reason injectables may be better sometimes?"

In this case, women, but it is also how other hate groups like the KKK recruit. Find a disenfranchised group, and start commiserating with them on the problems in their lives. Make it seem like you are one of them. Then start directing their self-blame at an outside target. Start small, with seemingly innocuous pieces of logic. Then start drawing unsavory conclusions from those observations. Nobody joins a hate group thinking “_NAME_ I sure want to hate some specific group of people.” They join because “Nobody is looking out for my needs and feelings except 
these people.”"

My family are normal, good Christian people but my step-grandfather was a free _NAME_ and I used to be very smart in a few of my past lives. They told me in a past life they look for people with potential or people who are very smart.

I had a scary dream a couple months ago where I was told the shadow government/deep state is different than the Illuminati. Illuminati is bigger.

176159938,"To add to this. I’ve just read a paper. And if I add it tk what I already know then this is what happens. Even if working memory bc of access to frontal lines is deficient is happening by med or sz The brain has something called BDNF, this helps with cells instruction decision making (deciding what a cell should differentiate it self as - as In how to function) and then if you are able to increase hippocampus usage (eg listen to music, or experience happy memoryies and feelings) then BDNF is likely to be more produced. If you do this regularly , it might help the neuropathic process of rewriting the Brain in a more flexible way where it accounts for the deficiency by doing the above post I made —/ developing routes via long term memories eg, muscle memory skills ; even things like paying attention ?"

176159948,"Hey guys, I was hoping to make a more thorough list of coping strategies people can use to talk themselves down from panic attacks/paranoia. I’m sure you’ve all seen my suggestions, but I wanted to see what yours are, too. Since this will hopefully become a resource thread, all posts that are not suggestions for how to calm yourself will be deleted, but no hard feelings. Just trying to keep this clean. I’ll start. Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Loo
k at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like you’re just daydreaming to observers."

176159973,Zinc deficiency causes insomnia and many other issues. It helps in sleep too. Also avoid day naps of any length as it can affect night time sleep. Also avoid caffeine beverages after 3 PM.

176159995,"Tragic Beauty I was staring at my sister as she stood beside me, into the mirror. She fanned her fame across her pristine powdered face; I was a modest virgin. I never wanted the responsibly of control. But I longed to be a beautiful queen. She enters in tearful tresses- a pearl rosary around her fragile neck. The white stone walls; sitting there braiding my sisters hair. Our brothers have returned: smoking opium in a room that smells of sandalwood, for a war is planned to create common good. I gaze at the elegant statues, the windows portray fields of green and dancing lemon trees. This time our brothers return to cause chaos and destroy our serene sanctuary. Lovely _NAME_. Is anyone truly _PERSON_? I watch the children, a tiger; they’re writing about a force between them and trying to decipher the hidden bridge between heaven and Lucifer. I’m 509 years into the future. Everyone had gone but me. I am cursed by secret meanings buried deep within; the boy with long hair is no longer a matter of 
concern to the other side of the sky. For this I begin to cry; the tears become floods and hurricanes and on that day the sun begins to reign over my dying days. The rose bush is full of thorns the mountain is bare; in all to the messiah but he does not appear. I wish the fires would just disappear. The colors sing clear. As he used to thousands of years ago; between the parting paths of ivy and mist; he holds a pink lotus in his hand and tells me some day I’ll understand. That I am _NAME_. That I am a special flower, that I have special powers. And the demon is haunting me; he lives on a satellite station that was lost between the waves. He is a parasite; I’ve tried to recreate him out of nothing; but he’s lost all his memories just causes dark possessions. Can you help me ? I need to disconnect the ghost from the power grid his host electric shocks and psychosis. I try to fight but the more I fight the more I can’t find the key he hid from me between the overdose and electric shocks! I used to see d
ragons in the clouds. I felt like home was a colorful splash of ideas all becoming true; the little man laughed and then he became just like you. Sapphire stained glass windows in through a realm of light between lives broken stories like seashells and sailors loving the bones of their lovers traveling between those terrible thunderstorms falling endlessly like water from an endless ocean storm in spaces above hiding I’d like to find a way back to the star on the ceiling that never meant anything until we all just vanished like ghosts only to be seen by a child who can see, once in a lifetime a whole new century. And now I am free–and now the ghost is returning to me–such a tragic beauty."

For example, I woke up and besides being a little tired I felt fairly normal and this continued for an hour and a half, after that I started to feel more disconnected and found it harder to focus. I know the way I feel isn’t normal and I am still aware of some of the ways things are different but I just kinda cycle in to different phases with some of the phases having me more aware of what is going on around me and me interacting more with the world.

It also made me feel extremely dizzy, I couldn’t stand in place more than 20 seconds without feeling like i was going to faint or fall over, however if I was walking I was fine.

176160206,Subtle paranoia. I’d worry why people said things the way they said. Probably more about meaning but I was a talker so obsessed about the spoken word. Racing thoughts. Found it hard to get to sleep. I’d say pretty common things in the realms of sz.

Do you think you will look into iv ketamine?"
176160221,"So long story short I discovered intermittent fasting and it’s been the best way for me to lose weight and feel healthy. Basically you stop snacking first, because every time you eat it spikes your insulin. Insulin’s job is to turn glucose (blood sugar) into fat, that’s it. When your body has no more glucose to burn it switches into ketosis (fat burning mode,) and turns your body fat into ketones and uses that as energy instead. So your body is either burning fat or storing fat. If you decrease the eating frequency, the amount of times you eat, then your body will spend more time fasting, or burning off the food you ate and then switching to your body fat to burn. Skipping breakfast and eating 2 squares meals a day and no snacking in between is absolutely guaranteed to make you lose weight. I do 48 hour fasts, and OMAD (one meal a day,) intermittently, and I have lost a lot of weight and feel way better. Fasting is very safe if you are just doing a day or two at the most. Extended fasts are s
afe if you have vitamins and electrolytes and have done your research, and have the body fat to burn."

And when I say HELL I mean a REALLY unbareable hell. We kinda live in hell, but thats for me to expand in some other thread. Back to the death subject, I remember when I was young hearing some good godly voices telling me that I’d have to pay beforehard (explains ‘hell’) and enjoy afterwards. No suicide allowed. I’m just waiting. Covid may be my transition. Every single day I trip around in dreams, so I’m not afraid of the idea of moving places in a bedtime timespan. Hope I helped."
174383085,"Hi, I am Chinese too. Welcome to this forum. I have not seen any good review for this medicine yet. On webmd.com, I saw four reviews and all are bad. Kind of disappointed. What med are you taking now? I heard abilify is best for negative symptom so far."

176160227,"I first got sick when I was 23 years old and now I’m 50. So 27 years. At first they wouldn’t let me into the hospital. I wasn’t doing well just outpatient, so I tried over and over again going to the local ETS. Finally I made a suicide attempt and after that I was in and out for years, culminating in 2 years in 2 long-term hospitals. After that, I started the pattern of in and out again. But they tried to conserve me again and I stopped going after I got off. Haven’t been back since."
176160228,"I don’t have a problem accepting my own mortality, it’s my hypothetical immortality (in this life) that I have an issue with. The question could be further refined when we look at our responses to other people’s death. X died this morning. He was much liked by everyone. As it is customary in these occasions those closest to X express their desbelief: “I can’t believe X is really dead”. What you’ll never hear from anyone, however grief stricken, is “I can’t believe X was really mortal after all”. Exploring the interdependence between our struggles with accepting our mortality on the one hand, and with accepting other people’s actual death on the other, is a question for another day. But I’d like to draw attention to an intriguing possibilty that could arguably provide a link to both experiences: what if our difficulties when grappling with these questions regarding mortality and death were not so much rooted in fear and grief as with cognitive bafflement? Paraphrasing an old 
formulation of this problem: Socrates is dead. If he is dead, he is no longer Socrates. Therefore Socrates is not dead. Logical niceties aside, I have a very real difficulty accepting that I can die. Partly this has to do with my other my part-time, half-hearted unusual beliefs, the idea that the devil needs my spark to keep this simulated universe running. He won’t let me die, not really. And yet, in a very real sense I am dead. Any input will be welcome. And please let’s not turn this into a religious discussion, I’m not discussing the afterlife, only my belief that I won’t be allowed to die in THIS life."
176160229,"Thanks for the detailed explanation aliali. I can remember myself stopping mid-sentence and forgetting what I was saying when I was with the doctor a few times. Maybe they took this into account, I was never really sure why they were giving it to me."

176160244,"During my last relapse in 2015, I was very suspicious of the hospital staff, the doctors and nurses, like very paranoid of their motives and I was reading their minds. I was hallucinating continuous, nonstop, eerie organ music. I was visually hallucinating visions in the curtain surrounding my bed. I was also visually hallucinating people’s faces in the same curtain. I was not getting any sleep for two nights while at the hospital. When I arrived home, the audio hallucinations continued. I began having closed eye hallucinations of extremely beautiful women, all of whom shape shifted into absolutely hideous and scary monsters. From that point, I was taken back to the hospital E.R. for Zyprexa/Ativan injections and sent back home where I fell asleep for 48 hours. I woke up free of psychosis."

176160254,"Your kids or even you must have brought them in from another place. Maybe one of their friends has them at his house and a couple crawled into your children’s clothes and bred at your house. Maybe a guest or repairman in your house accidentally brought them in. There are many ways they could have gotten into your home and spread. The board & care homes I lived in a few years ago had a bedbug infestation. It was weird because before I was in that home, I knew nothing about bedbugs. I shared a small room with another guy and he started getting them in his bed but my bed was 4 feet away from his but while he was finding some in his bed I never got one in my bed. But other tenants started getting them too and so to avoid getting into trouble with the health department the owners brought in exterminators and gave everybody a weeks notice to take all their belongings out of their rooms and wash all their clothes. It’s a long story but at that period the owners were converting the whole facility into 
a licensed group home and kicked most people out who were too high functioning. Most of us moved down the street into a place owned by the same people. We had to literally wash all our clothes and check every single possession so as not to carry bedbugs to the other place. It didn’t work. Someone brought them in and the owners kept lagging on taking care of the problem. I was getting bitten every night. I had bites all over my arms and legs and I was getting fresh bites every night. The owners did nothing for months and when a sympathetic staff member talked to me she was horrified because I had about 40 bites on both arms together. When I moved from there into my current apartment there was absolutely no way they would let me stay here if I had brought even one bedbug inside. So this same sympathetic staff member helped me clean my bedding, my clothes, my car, and all my meager possessions. I had to clean the inside of a VCR, I had to go through every page of every book, I had to throw away all my pads of 
paper etc. We sprayed everything with alcohol and when I moved in here I didn’t see any bedbugs for a week or two until one morning I saw one on my chest while I was in the bathroom combing my hair or brushing my teeth or something. My heart sank because I could have got kicked out if I infested this apartment complex. But after seeing that one, I never saw another one. I feel for you _AT_MENTION_ , those bugs are insidious and tenacious. It’s going to take a concentrated effort to get rid of them and keep them from coming back. They can hide anywhere."

176160290,"I the same boring routine, nothing new. Feeling really negative. having bad thoughts. how do i make my life more interesting. I really hate my mental illness. and im still fat, losing weight on aps is hard it takes a huge toll on my self esteem."
176160291,"There’s power in hatred, too. My pdoc said about what children want, it’s “Love me or hate me, but don’t ignore me.” I have never loved kids that much, but I have hated them. I keep it to myself, though. Because I remember the pain of being hated. The idea is to hate her back, not to fall."
176160292,My friend (yes the lady pestering me to go holidays) asked if I wanted to go with her so i did. We got a lift there from her husband. But she said she forgot her Oyster card (bus pass). I offered her to borrow my card. But I couldn’t stand being there. So I said I wanna go. She said wait 20 mins we can go together. But 10 mins passed and I just thought sod it. Went to the dance floor where she was dancing gave her the bill told her i can’t stand it and left. It was making it really anxious the music. I felt bad leaving her to go home alone but not my problem. Hope that teaches her a lesson next time. She always uses me to go places so she don’t have to take the bus on her own at night time when coming back…so hope she don’t bother asking me next time. I was so bored
176160293,"You won’t notice meditation positive effect for a couple of months. Like any skill you have to master it, then one day you will look back on how your life has changed since you took up meditation."
176160294,Here I am passing by when my Friday is hell because I am without any money to buy online
174383099,"No thanks…I don’t need a big helping of _USER_ID_ everywhere I go, thank you very much. I have to say though it is such a relief and feels good to have someone accidentally figure it out but then treat me fine. But no thanks."
176160295,Thank God you love them then! Your life is so valuable. And you would hurt your kids deeply and permanently if you checked out.
176160296,"Just heard the neighbors talking with each other outside my living room window. They don’t like me. They were saying some bad stuff about me. Loudly. They were pissed too. Well, I’m going to keep on doing what I’m doing. I don’t need them. And the one guy used to come on our property just to smoke pot and even my roommate, who used to talk to him, didn’t want him on our property. So It’s no loss. He’s weird anyways and a loser. The other guy was the neighbor upstairs. He caused me many nights of grief with tapping the ceiling every night, constantly. And he used to say “hi” to me and at first I think it was sincere but then I think he was faking the friendliness. And I’ll be damned before I believe that the guy upstairs wasn’t pulling some sh*t like the women next door. He’s been an ass anyways from the get-go, he acts like an ass. I’ll end this with: I knew what was going to happen months ago. I told the counselor who visits us every three weeks that these neighbors are p
robably, most likely, going to win and they’re not only going to act like it’s normal and natural but they’re going to act like the laughter, the bullying, the driving me crazy, listening in my apartment, the mind games, was all perfectly normal and acceptable. I told her however this ends up, they pulled some rotten stuff and I told her, just remember, they pulled some underhanded things that people just don’t do. Probably the biggest offence was playing on my “niceness”. Everybody has their own perceptions. My perception is that when this first started that old lady wasn’t some poor old, brave woman defending against the big bad neighbor. It’s more like she quickly found a sucker who she can get a toehold in his mind because he’s good natured (as my case worker always tells me) and turned it into exploiting a situation. I’m tired of this crap. But at least I know what they think of me and where I stand."
176160297,Reading “The Path to Love” by _PERSON_.
176160298,"No worries _AT_MENTION_. I was excited to meet you, and consider this post an invitation to keep corresponding if you’re comfortable with that. It’s so hard for me to make friends because of all the lies about me. It’s hard to get to the “get to know you” point because people consider me a freak. I just consider myself a fairly normal person with a fairly mundane life and a fairly serious illness. I can’t discuss it in more detail than that, but if I could defend myself in no uncertain terms, I would."
176160299,Practice makes perfect.
176160300,"Your art is intriguing and beautifully rendered. Each piece makes me think, in some cases about the technique used to create the piece and in other cases about what the meaning of the piece is. I keeping getting drawn back to the angel drawing. I find myself wondering what she is searching for. Also, I wonder why her wings are so small and what that means to her."
176160301,"It takes a little while to kick in all the way and it takes finding the right med for you individually. It’s a process. I used to be very anti med, like I believed nature made me flawless, but after some struggling and realizations I’ve found I enjoy life more when I’m more sane, so to speak. I’m more productive and less prone to outbursts. I believe pills are a tool to help us cope with the bizarre environment we’ve created for ourselves as a society. I also figured out that, for me, at least, the voices seem to have a somewhat limited vocabulary. They rarely surprise me but when they do it trips me up. Scientists believe it’s a part of our brain. You know how they say we only use ten percent of our brains? Schizophrenics use more. We create hypothetical situations and conversations, we find symbols in mundane things. Sure, it might all be a matrix filled with pixies and angels and demons and aliens. But for me spending all my time thinking about that was impractical, dangerous, and a 
waste of time. I have other goals besides being some new age philosopher. I find I can still study all that stuff and believe what I want to believe on the pills but I’m more suited to get along in society. Also a good amount of my conclusions were just made from using the voices as a magic eight ball and were frankly false. Just because aliens might exist doesn’t mean they’re talking to you and harvesting your negative energy, it’s more likely that your unhappiness is based on evolution because contented ness does not breed success in the animal kingdom. Which could being being harvested for its pain and suffering by other dimensional beings…but regardless of all that nonsense it’s all hypothetical and gets in the way of me enjoying my life. We can get philosophical about Plato and his shadows on the cave but at the end of the day I need to get some sleep and meds help that."
176160302,"Hey guys, thanks for the responses, but on second account I don’t think it is a good subject for this forum and for me. I kind of hoped to keep it non-triggering by specifically asking for that. But I just did a bit of reflection and think this topic is better closed. I think you guys are right and people have been talking about end times for ages. Literally. And even if there are end times of whatever kind coming, religious or environmental or whatever, nobody really benefits if I sit here behind my pc having creepy thoughts about that. Can one of the mods please close it? _AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_ ?"
176160303,When I was full blown psychotic I had an invisible friend in the form of someone who had passed away. He didn’t talk but just sat or stood there or even jogged with me at times

176160305,“TheGrizzledArmadillo” or “SunnySideUp.”
174383111,"Yeah, I see a doctor. The problem is, is that DID and Schizophrenia are similar. When I research it on my own I just get more confused. That’s why I wanted opinions of people who actually have it if I sound similar to what they have experienced. I have a DID specialist. I keep telling her I think it may be schizophrenia instead but she says its not. My other counselor thinks I should listen to her but she is neither a DID specialist or a specialist in Schizphrenia."
176160306,"I had the symptoms and still do, but i know my cognitive, psycho-social issues have been a big issue for me. I dont think its chemically based issues, but spiritual and the others."

176160308,"I do this sometimes. I think it is ok, as long as you don’t do it all the time."
176160309,"Yes, they needed to know, as much as that scared me to tell them. Doctor is having me titration down on the Zoloft. I’m now on a half dose for a week, then another half. He didn’t want me going cold turkey, and made sure I didn’t have pill control with my family. I’m on watch, and really don’t want to go on the ward. I feel safest at home."

176160310,"Hello. I’m going to be gentle with myself today because my mind is not being nice to me. I have a little list. I do not much in the morning, just bought a scratch ticket as a distraction, I do that. Mt husband started laundry before he went to work. I’m going to switch it. Tidy a bit. I have to drive my son to a meeting at his work. Also go get some frozen dinners, I am trying to do dinners but have had a block with cooking for quite a while. Must keep simple. I think I do the best I can. I have a meeting with my nurse this week. That will help so I have someone to open up with re all the things that are happening. Looking at all this it will be a big day so probably best if I get lots of rest too. Hope everyone has a good day."
176160311,Well said _AT_MENTION_ .
174383100,"I’ve taken a written test before and I scored high for depression. Yes, today I was definitely depressed. But my last doctor thought that I suffered with both bipolar and some schizophrenic symptoms. I agree with her the most. Thanks _AT_MENTION_"
176160312,"Hey, sorry about what I said about your hair. Here’s some candy!!! ^.^"
176160313,I felt like the whole world hated me for many years and I was miserable because of it. What a happy day it was when my pdoc tweaked my meds and I realized this just wasn’t true! I’m sure this is just a delusion for you _AT_MENTION_ as it was for me. Consult with your pdoc re. It.
176160314,I’ll do that 51
176160315,"Try lowering slowly to 2mg or better titrate to 40mg ziprasidone, I think it’s just the medicine hasn’t take its fullest effect. I have relapsed twice but all I was stable on lowest dose. Go with Metformin and ziprasidone for most weight loss effect but you will be really tired though"
176160316,Vitamin B1 (thiamine) definily try it has something to improve dopamine function. More motivation to keep on doing an activity. Also better memory recall. Vitamin D is another thing which helps like B1 but D gives more energy too. Best part of these is these are natural body needed things. Low B1 is common especially on medications and other health issues and low B1 is linked to many neurological issues even full blown catatonia so worth a try its not expensive too like other things.
174383118,Nah. I don’t think so. Nothing happened til now. Only drooling.
176160317,"All imma say is that my doctor didn’t get it. i can’t jog and i told her this. she told me to try harder like im not trying hard enough for ???? sake, really did not appreciate that, it is undermining my srtruggles"
176160318,"I had one pdoc who seemed like he disliked me. There were a couple of times I was thinking, “Aren’t you supposed to be on my side?”"
174383109,"It’s meant to be weight neutral, but must be taken with food. It’s absorbed better with a balanced meal. If you keep active, that helps a lot to keep weight down. There’s also been research involving links with proper diet, schizophrenia, and depression. Junk food doesn’t really help us feel good physically, which stresses the mind and leads to symptoms."
176160319,I remember mowing the lawn with a lawnmowers powered by muscles. No problems starting the motor. The blades lasted forever.

176160322,"Dear _PERSON_, Please help I am going through so much. People are going to kill me soon. I want to go to the emergency but I don’t know if someone can help me. I hope I will make it. People are watching me. I feel hated. I don’t want to die. There is no hope for me."

176160328,We are with you _AT_MENTION_. This life is so difficult sometimes. If I were you I would just be kind to yourself and wait for spring. Anything above bare minimum is a success. I’ve been there.
176160329,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Thanks, but the reason why I keep posting these threads is that I don’t have anyone to talk to and I just want to beat the ???? out of myself because it’s comfortable. If I can’t beat my trauma, I’ll just beat the ???? out of myself… I want to get out of this trauma and PTSD but nothing has worked."
176160330,And other times it won’t work? Any experience would help. I’m trying to calm down.
176160331,I relate so much with you on that. I bathe maybe 1-2 times a week and that’s a turn off for girls so I don’t know _PERSON_ my next gf will react to that or my sz in general
176160332,"Thanks for the responses, it makes me feel better knowing I’m not the only one. I’ve become better over time at ignoring them as I fall asleep. It’s sometimes easier knowing I’ll have some peace and quiet in the morning."
176160333,That’s so very true. Everytime I have delusions I feel like I need someone to agree with me even though that’s not the right way to do it. They tell me I’m having delusions and it makes me feel better at the time but kiks right back in once there done telling me
174383110,"Hi guys, havent been on this site for a few years, i am on 525 mg of clozarill for the past 9 years, lately i have been really tired like sleeping 14 hours a day, any advice on overcoming this issue? Thanks in advance, _NAME_"
176160334,Is it possible to have sza with only occasional hypomania?
176160335,"It is a difficult question, because they overlap a lot. The core symptom of depression is anhedonia, but it is also a prominent part of negative symptoms. However, some things, like blunted/flattened emotions are more characteristic of negative symptoms than depression. But to make the question even more difficult, schizoid personality disorder is composed of what is more or less identical to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and dissociative disorders can also blunt emotions. -_NAME_."

176160339,Welcome back! It’s been awhile.
176160340,I had a big win the old dressing table i have i improved to where it works perfectly. First i figured out which drawers slotted in best where there was one drawer which did not slide in smoothly. I determined that the top part of the front of it was too high so with nitrile work gloves on and a sharp utiltity knife and with a folded piece of reusable wipe tissue cut small to shape to cushion my finger when applying pressure to the back of the blade i shaved wood off that top part putting the drawer back in at times to see where more had to be removed. It now slides in easily i also have super slick tape added to the drawers and i had the washing machine going to muffle the sound a bit
174383114,Why won’t you vote? Your vote counts greatly! But maybe you don’t have to vote since you’re not bipolar or sza bipolar type.
176160341,The information I have read says that 1200 calories is the minimum for women. You should almost surely have more.
176160342,Took geodon for quite awhile years ago. Besides some weight gain I couldn’t go in the sun and my gums got very swollen and my teeth broke and fell out.
174383113,"I’ve had it for 5 years, and my symptoms got a lot less problematic at around the 3 year mark. It doesn’t happen for everybody but some people do make impressive partial recoveries. I haven’t been delusional for two years now, but I still hear and see things others don’t. Best of luck, and yeah the family forum should help."
176160343,I googled remote neural monitoring but stopped reading into it after a while. My voices said ‘you won’t find anything on google about it’.

I used to do a lot of math in my head pretty fast with the help of stimulants like energy drinks. Can’t do that anymore. My brain fires 10x slower now with meds. The good thing is the synaptic pruning has lessened the philosophical thoughts and obsessions."
176160348,I earned another nice reply.
176160349,"Im sorry to hear about that _AT_MENTION_ . To be honest gambling really irritates me. As far as I’m concerned its just an easy way to part vulnerable people from their money. I guess just don’t blame yourself. There are people that fall into debt via gambling that don’t have any psychiatric conditions to blame. I’m glad your parents helped you out. And likewise, I feel like if my parents stopped looking after me I’m pretty sure Id be out on the streets."
176160350,"just am thinking it is time after so many years of crying of Mr. _PERSON_ and _USER_ID_ _PERSON_. to start reading even on the internet what people have to say about this lovely darling (but destructive) young couple!! so far, i am wondering if when they say to be open about mental illness to stave off our darling newleyweds here, do we have to announce our condition? just bitter but curious. hugs, _NAME_"

176160356,Effexor is great for my depression but I take 300 mgs. I get side effects particularly IBS type symptoms but it works for me. I’m not adverse to you trying a mood stabilizer. I am no expert but I’d be asking a shrink. The good ones get an idea of what is up with certain people. It really is an art. Hope you sort it out!
176160357,Maybe she was trying to give you a compliment.
176160358,but your ???? is real. flushing it into the sewer system. hopefully your paying your bills and taxes then. think of all the ????. rivers of ????.
176160359,I don’t worry about intrusive thoughts anymore. The psychologist told me that it’s not the sz and that everyone gets them. Just try not to fixate on them as it’s all a load of rubbish that you need to actively filter out of your mind. It’s not you.

176160365,When I worked as a bellboy I told a homeless guy I’d get him a free hotel room to live in. I got his hopes up then I was hospitalized and started back on meds again haha
176160366,The dizzy sedated feeling you get from valium and other benzo is not a normal feeling its actually due to toxic effect you are feeling like that. Also body get used to it meaning you need to gradually raise the dose to get same effect. Thus its not a solution for any problem.
176160367,"You’re trying to figure out how you’re “being monitored”. There are no brain chips involved. No human technology. It is a brain ailment. Your brain is injured and is stimulating the production of too much adrenaline. The adrenaline has trouble clearing out so it forms adrenochrome. That is the chemical responsible for LSD’s drug high. Too much of that causes all kinds of metaphysical effects, like hallucinations and such."
176160368,"Honestly, I don’t even think you wrote anything worth apologizing for. You gave a suggestion in an attempt to suggest something that would make people’s lives easier, and you were unnecessarily attacked for it. You didn’t do or say anything wrong, but you apologized anyway. That’s more than enough. You don’t need penance."

176160371,Ok i did the modification it worked good. Fortunately for me even if it tips forward or backwards it stops it is a perfect modification. I used a small pair of cutting pliers to remove some bars of plastic at the bottom. I made the cuts with them and then pulled the plastic tabs i created off with a larger pair of needle nosed pliers. Then i used a sharp kitchen utility knife with nitrile gloves on a bit of reusable tissue wipe cut out to support my finger when applying pressure to the back of the blade. That was just to scrape any plastic left away but it was very clean anyway. I had to make space for the wheels. I also used powerful snips to remove metal off the wheels at the top and bottom to make them fit better as well Image_2023427833036×4048 3.56 MB Image_2032042897344048×3036 3.5 MB Image_2023040234048×3036 2.36 MB
176160372,yea i hope so too… and if it does happen then i hope your meds will work again cause sometimes the meds don’t work anymore then or need to go on higher dose also.
176160373,If it makes you feel anxious then it’s probably good not to see things as non random. I have the opposite issue if I think things are random I get really stressed. Because I like to believe everything in my life happens for a good reason so therefore it can’t be random
176160374,I talked to my doctor about taking fmla when going back to work full time so I don’t have to use sick days for appointments

176160376,I would really want to be in your shoes with this. Sounds like you have met a good person from what you say.
176160377,Thank you! I recently got diagnosed schizophrenia and found this form while researching schizophrenia.

176160381,"I did two days this week and it went great! Everyone I met was very welcoming. They kept saying thank you over and over. I was there for four hours on Monday, but they only saved 1.5 hours of work on Friday, so I didn’t stay longer than that. The office manager said she’d save more for next Wednesday and Friday when I plan to go back. They have an other office volunteer who goes on Tuesdays. I found another full-time job posting to apply for - accounts payable manager at my mental health community services board.

176160387,Well having a bit of psychosis isnt the end the world. but full blown psychosis like you just went through is not good. So if you do this and it happens again you should just stay on your med.
176160388,The forties went way too quick. I am now 50 and I feel about mid thirties/40’s…It was a bit of a blur my 40’s.

176160392,It’s not a dream. It’s real.
176160393,"Yeah this forum has given me greater knowledge of how people cope with sz. I’m just starting to grow dependent on it and feel lonely at night when there’s no forum to go on. I think I will write my goals in my journal instead. I like this site, but it’s becoming an addiction."

And that’s been very true for me. Same way when I hallucinate or have psychotic symptoms. I acknowledge it, but also use realism to counteract the extreme thoughts I get."

We planned ahead for a treat and we were both really looking forward to it because we haven’t allowed ourselves pizza since at least mid-March when we both started trying to lose weight. I had a small salad to start, _NAME_ had six mozzarella sticks! He REALLY went over his calorie range! I had 1800 calories today instead of 1200-1400. Maybe that will shake up my weight a little bit. I’m going right back to 1200-1400, it was just one day that I had a treat. I know I will start losing again, but I’m sick and tired of 251.3!

I wish I had some suggestions for you, but I feel unqualified to say anything since you are dealing with physical illness. It sounds like you’re already doing some good things, eating healthy and having sma
ll meals. Are you trying to just maintain weight or gain some? I wasn’t sure by reading your post. You can use Sparkpeople.com to give you a calorie range to maintain weight. When you enter your goal, you can choose to lose or maintain. That will give you a starting point anyway. I’m not sure if MyFitnessPal has an option to maintain weight, or whether it’s just for weight loss."

I didn’t know I would be passing it; it was a surprise. It was such a weird feeling; I went through so much in there even though most of it was in my head. I was in moderate traffic and I was looking for the PT clinic but as I passed the hospital I looked around at the other drivers and thought, “If they only knew.” It brought back memories and it is ridiculous how far I’ve come and how much better I am compared to those days in the hospital."

But still, check it out, and tell us about the result.

176160513,"I miss my kids and my grandkids and my ex-husband. I miss my old house and my old bed and all my furniture. I miss my old pdoc. I miss having things the way I liked them. I like having it be my home. Now I just live in a room in somebody else’s house. I don’t feel comfortable here. I’m not at home here. It’s like I have to walk on eggshells all the time so I don’t upset my sister. She’s very particular about things and gets upset easily. She’s upset all the time about work. She’s a really unhappy person in general. It’s a generally negative vibe here. I’m not allowed to make noise. If my phone makes a ding for an incoming text it pisses her off, so she turned that off on my phone. Now I never know when I get a text. She gets mad at me if I don’t answer her texts right away, but I don’t hear them anymore. So I feel like I constantly have to check my phone to see if she texted me. It’s weird. I can’t talk on the phone when she’s studying on the weekends because it bother
s her. I can’t make noise in the kitchen because it echoes in her room. She’s constantly screaming cuss words because the neighbors dog barks. It’s little things that all add up to making me miss home. I know there’s no going back. But maybe there’s another change in my future. I can’t see staying in this situation long term. I don’t feel like I’m home. Maybe I’ll never feel home again. Maybe I lost home for good. I hope not."
176160514,I feel people all the time are staring at me I don’t think that I look that good I am overweight but I get this all the time and its not in my mind I feel its really happening. And I am not paranoid I sense everyone’s eyes on me and I don’t get it for one thing I don’t like it and wish people would go about their own business and stay out of my way my face and my space I feel their all up on me staring at me and it is starting to piss me off a bit. They don’t just stare they eye ball me I think their trying to size me up I don’t know and its mean looks I am getting and people looking at me like I have two heads or something. And I have felt like I am being talked about too cause today I was at the grocery store and this cashier in the check out line mentioned to the other cashier something to this affect that she looks like a man I think they had to be talking about me I do not look like a man but she looked right at me when she said this. Made me anxious but I got in her line anyway. I 
had people tell me I am ugly online and too my face I don’t think I am ugly but I don’t think I am pretty either I am so so or ok average I guess. I don’t even want to leave my house sometimes because of people meaning mugging me or giving me the stink eyes or the occasional eye rolling so typical of some teens but I seen adults do that too. I don’t know what to do or if I can do anything to stop the staring. I just want to be left alone by all people except my family I hate most people anyway for good reason cause Of the way I am treated everyday you would think I was a freak in the side show the attention I get I don’t like it at all. But there is nothing I can say to change what people already think of me people will think what they want to think I just have to go about my life but Life has been anything but kind to me people are cruel and evil for the most part at least that’s who I run across and haven’t had anyone to show me any different so done its not even funny about to give up and thr

I mean nothing spectacular but just everyday things like today at my shrink appointment I walk in and a few guys looked like they were trying to intimidate me so I met their stare and then some big oaf started acting crazy but I didn’t let it scare me. And that kinda made the two lady receptionists begrudging give me a look of respect. But last week I was talking to some woman my age there and we talked and shared a laugh. I love surprising people because the world underestimates me so there’s nowhere to go but up. And in my drug days, I was up for doing things on the spur of the moment like going to clubs or scoring drugs or getting involved with strangers. I kinda miss that but just a couple of nights ago I was at a convenience store just looking for something to buy because I had extra money. I turned a corner in an aisle and my eyes met this woman’s eyes. I startled her but I just wa
lked part her and went down a different aisle and then she seemingly, deliberately, walked near me checking me out and I guess I passed some test because she looked at me friendly. As I went on my way I kept running into her and in my perspective, she was up to something and wanted me part of it. It got me interested and a little pumped up, like my drug days when going on my little adventures on the spur of the moment. I was intrigued. And I thought, “Wow, I still got it.” It was a little shot of adrenalin. But then the store closed and she wandered away but I thought I was pretty cool."

174383152,"Good points . I live my life, but it’s a rather basic life . I’ve never worked . Socially I only interact F2F with my stepfamily who live near me. There are no friends .Even before COVID I didn’t go very far from home due to a poor sense of direction and mild agoraphobia. To lead that basic life I have a fair amount of help and support with cleaning,shopping, health appointments etc. Without that help, at my last place, I was self neglecting . Am I functioning at the same level as a person from the general who’s of the same age and level of intelligence ? The answer is NO. Symptoms wise, based on DSM/ICD, criteria I’m mostly in remission.What has helped is the reduction of stress here compared to when I lived in Essex. There’s some stubborn paranoia re positive symptoms . Negative’s - I’m not too sure- lack of ambition, emotionally rather flat, fairly low initiative, Of course there’s also the Asperger’s/ASD which has an impact on things .

I only lost control of mind and body during the unconscious one. Before those 3 years, I would have many extreme unconscious ones multiple times a year. Start with meditation. That was my first step in dealing with the inner voices without shutting them out. Practice patience too. That’s another useful tool. I am still quite impatient but I’ve improved with time."

176160587,"Hi friends, second thread. Love reading through and feeling not alone. About 40 days ago I experienced FEP and after two weeks of Seraquel hell I did stabilize enough to come off. I was a huge consumer of energy drinks (high in B vitamins) and was recently on a hardcore binge, 2 - 4 a day. I recall about two months ago my hands stopped responding to the caffeine as in they did not shake or tremble at all. I remember specifically noticing this and how odd it seemed. After much research I found vitamin b6 toxicity causes neuropathy, which is problems of the nerves in the hands and feet typically and one manifestation is low response to vibrations. If you were to read on Wikipedia, psychosis is also a severe side effect of the toxicity and I did NOT stop the energy drinks once I noticed the hand stillness… I did not put it together.

I was high pretty much all day on them concurrent to the energy drink binge. What a perfect storm for sz to develop. I pray that I make a recovery as I have been clean off weed, caffeine, nicotine since it happened. Also, I do not have delusions or paranoia, but my current issue is an uncontrollable inner monologue at times, and severe insomnia and any effects that arise from the sleep deprivation. Thoughts? Thanks for letting me share. Also, I have accepted I may have developing sz/a permanently so I do not want to come off as naive. I

174383173,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Early Substance Use Cessation Improves Cognition-10 Years Outcome in First-Episode Psychosis Patients. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Background: Cognitive impairment may be a risk factor for, as well as a consequence of, psychosis. Non-remitting symptoms, premorbid functioning, level of education, and socioeconomic background are known correlates. A possible confounder of these associations is substance use, which is common among patients with psychosis and linked to worse clinical outcomes. Studies however show mixed results for the effect of substance use on cognitive outcomes. In this study, the long-term associations of substance use with cognition in a representative sample of first-episode psychosis patients were examined. Methods: The sample consisted of 195 patients. They were assessed for symptom lev
els, function, and neurocognition at 1, 2, 5, and 10?years after first treatment. Test scores were grouped into factor analysis-based indices: motor speed, verbal learning, visuomotor processing, verbal fluency, and executive functioning. A standardized composite score of all tests was also used. Patients were divided into four groups based on substance-use patterns during the first 2?years of treatment: persistent users, episodic users, stop-users, and nonusers. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effects modeling. Results: Gender, premorbid academic functioning, and previous education were the strongest predictors of cognitive trajectories. However, on motor speed and verbal learning indices, patients who stopped using substances within the first 2?years of follow-up improved over time, whereas the other groups did not. For verbal fluency, the longitudinal course was parallel for all four groups, while patients who stopped using substances demonstrated superior performances compared with nonusers. Persist
ent users demonstrated impaired visuomotor processing speed compared with nonusers. Within the stop- and episodic use groups, patients with narrow schizophrenia diagnoses performed worse compared with patients with other diagnoses on verbal learning and on the overall composite neurocognitive index. Discussion: This study is one of very few long-term studies on cognitive impairments in first-episode psychosis focusing explicitly on substance use. Early cessation of substance use was associated with less cognitive impairment and some improvement over time on some cognitive measures, indicating a milder illness course and superior cognitive reserves to draw from in recovering from psychosis."

I was originally diagnosed bipolar but later sza then sz. The one pdoc I remember he was a bipolar expert and said I’m not bipolar. So it seems that as I said my highs don’t correspond to criteria. My depression does though - I’ve had some pretty lengthy low moods as well as shorter ones. So here’s my confusion - do I have sza depressed type? - but then what about high moods? That’s why they never put me on antidepressants. Or sz (incl. short highs and labile moods) with depression? How do I tell if it’s sz with depression - or sza if I’m not meeting criteria for bipolar? Got to ask my pdoc on this one - but I thought I’d ask you guys too…

176160635,"Maybe you’re not ready to be outgoing and are sending contradictory vibes. That’s what happened to me. I didn’t realize how badly I’d been hurt and didn’t totally want friends because I was weak from being hurt and didn’t know whom I could trust. So, ask yourself if you are really up to it.

Or the truth is, that i’ll always have to pay more efforts to be more alive, thinking as the others etc? What do you think?

176160694,"The pope says the devil is a person not a metaphor as I read in the article. My boyfriend as of 5 years (or so I thought) was always weird, carries multiple ids, and lies about his age. He always brings me gifts and the pope says the devil always brings many gifts. My boyfriend is very polite and the pope says the devil is very polite and intelligent like my boyfriend is. I had weird experiences like I thought I was possessed and the lights turning on and off when I was with my boyfriend. How do I know if he is really the devil? I’m worried because after being with my boyfriend I’m scared I will end up in North Korea since my boyfriend claims to have international connections. I’m not sure how to carry on my life because I have _PERSON_ delusions and sometimes hear things like voices that are quiet. Once when I was at the hospital it involved Russians and I heard in my head that I was going to a certain hospital. It was later confirmed by hospital staff that I was going to that hospital. I ne
ver heard of that hospital and there was no way I could have guessed it. Anyone else have experiences with strangers they have met that you think are the devil based on what the pope said. I’m Catholic so this concerns me. I was friends with a professor/priest at my university who told me my papers were of silence and genuine religious experience. I’m very serious and concerned. I also sometimes hear things that talks about certain celebrities and their inner lives and then something in the news confirms what I said. My main concern is if my boyfriend is the devil because I’ve heard that in 11 years they want to turn me into the dictator by way of plastic surgery and kill me at age 47. This really concerns me because I had visions of hell and that I would go there if I turn into a dictator."

I have some that are cruel and some that are helpful, and some that can be both. My BIG problem was one voice who dominated the scene. I struggled with him for 28 very long years. He would knock me down and then help me up and then knock me down again, over and over. He was my God and I learned to forgive him countless times. But unfortunately that never made him sorry and I ended up condemning him to a two dimensional simulation, and although it didn’t really happen, I realized that after 28 years I’d reached my limit and that even a saint has a limit. Finally I stopped believing in him and he left. I guess he served his purpose. The war is over and I now have bloodlust after the long hard fight."

Has anyone here had ‘supernatural’ type hallucinations and does anyone know what kind of hallucinations these are called? By supernatural, I mean feeling presences in rooms and feeling energy in the room though there’s nothing there. Last week, I’ve been feeling a comforting type of invisible energy embracing me while I was lying in bed (which felt good, but also strange). There were other recent experiences I’ve had that I’m thinking are hallucinations, but I can’t remember them right now. Would these just be considered tactile hallucinations or a somatic hallucination? I don’t know what these would be called, so I might be wrong about this. Also please don’t bring religion into this thread."

176160720,"I found the answer why my working memory getting worse and worse. Working memory issue was my first symptom I noticed years back. 3.5.4. On-line monitoring Based on phenomenological observation of posturing (see above) we investigated the ability of on-line monitoring as an essential component of working memory in catatonia since the inability to terminate movements may be related to a deficit in on-line monitoring of the spatial position of movements. Since both on-line monitoring and active storage/retrieval can be considered as parts of working memory (_PERSON_ 1995, _PERSON_ et al. 1999) we investigated working memory with an one-back and two-back task in catatonic patients in FMRI (see _PERSON_ et al. 2000). Catatonic patients showed significantly worse performance in both one-back and two-back tasks such that their deficit seems not to be limited to active storage/retrieval. In the latter case one would have expected worse performance in the two-back task only. Instaed catatonia can be charac
erized by concomittant problems in on-line processing and monitoring accounting for bad performance in the one-back task. Catatonic patients showed significantly decreased activation in right lateral orbitofrontal including ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (i.e. VLPFC) during the working memory task in FMRI compared to psychiatric and healthy controls (_PERSON_ 2000). In addition catatonic behavioral symptoms correlated significantly with activation in right lateral orbitofrontal cortex whereas motor symptoms showed a significant relationship with right dorsolateral prefrontal activity. Investigation of working memory in Parkinson?s did show alteration in lateral prefrontal cortex especially in left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (i.e. DLPFC) whereas orbitofrontal cortical function including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex remained intact (_PERSON_ and _PERSON_ 1998). In summary catatonia can be characterized by major deficits in on-line monitoring and right lateral orbitofrontal i.e. ventrolateral prefro
ntal cortical (VLPFC) function whereas parkinsonian patients do rather show deficits in left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortical (i.e. DLPFC) function."

I still to this day find this one interesting en.wikipedia.org Wave function collapse In quantum mechanics, wave function collapse occurs when a wave function—initially in a superposition of several eigenstates—reduces to a single eigenstate due to interaction with the external world. This interaction is called an ""observation"". It is the essence of a measurement in quantum mechanics which connects the wave function with classical observables like position and momentum. Collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time; the other is the continuous evolution... Did anyone else have physics topic quantum mechanics come up? And in what context"

176160787,"In my personal experience, for me, suicidal ideation is more about finding the pain of day-to-day life becoming unbearable and desperately wanting to get relief from the pain, than about actually wanting to die. I’m grown used to having suicidal ideation since it has been a symptom of my major depressive disorder. I’ve learned that for me these feelings come and go and I pretty much just ignore my suicidal ideation at this point. It differs for everyone though and you definitely need to take suicidal ideation seriously and make sure your pdoc and therapist are aware of your feelings so that they can intervene as necessary. This is especially true if the feelings of suicidal ideation are new or have suddenly become much worse."

176160810,If your parents make you feel this way or if you just feel this way then it isn’t the real you that feels that way. Our society is screwy at almost every corner. You’re not disabled. You’re more capable than you know. It’s a matter of breaking yourself free from that kind of programing.

Sorry to sort of derail the topic but ignoring things like this for the sake of politeness is seriously stupid. I ain’t grateful for much right now except for the blueberry muffin I just ate and didn’t have to stress about cooking my damn self. It’s fine to be grateful for things and use it to get us to a better feeling place but let us not excuse the captives on our planet who want to gaslight us and doubt what we know is true for ourselves.

If your sz manifested in violence towards your family and you claim media had no influence, and as you say before that you haven’t been traumatised, where do you think your violence comes from? Could it be your way of dealing with things as a child with inner rage and sibling rivalry? What is it about you, your life that upbringing that brought about your condition and thoughts of harming others? You often blame everything on schizophrenia like you have had no influence on your own life and outlook. Oh! I’ve been violent, blame it on the sz. Oh, I can’t be bothered to do anything, it must be the sz etc. At some point we all have to take responsibility, sz seems your easy way out from learned he

My auto living was ok, but now after 20 years we are afraid of being infected and we have to take measures to protect ourselves from the coronavirus infection. The world has changed and we do not know when this crisis is over. When I lived in my auto I had to protect myself from other people especially during nights and now I need to protect myself again from other people who might be infected.

Second, I haven’t seen any update whether the doubling time has indeed increased from 3.5 years in 2010 to 73 days, as projected.

174383246,"Like most sociology aficionados, I tend to gravitate towards social constructionist explanations of social phenomena, and SZ, despite affecting individual rather than collectives, and being partly rooted in biology, is also deeply social. I strongly believe I’ve been trying over the last year to live up to my role as a schizophrenic, which explains my rumbustious persona on this forum. Now that I have accepted, albeit reluctantly, that I don’t suffer from SZ, I’ve been behaving even less schizophrenically than before. My real OCD persona has finally come to the fore. I also know some of you are warming up to the idea that I’ve been misdiagnosed. For those of you who are sceptical of the power of role-playing I have included this article introducing the “social role taking theory of hypnosis”. Pretty compelling enough.

Sometimes I emerge from the boredom and get interested in some things. For example I can read for 45 minutes. For me the amotivation is only sometimes.
176160895,"_AT_MENTION_ You really are brilliant. There?s a debate on my treatment time. Some think I really am suicidal, and the IOP therapists think it?s just OCD. Either way, I?ve acted on the thoughts and overdosed three times in the last five years. The ideal, of course, would be that I only reach out for help in true emergencies. The problem is, I can?t always tell what is ocd and what?s not and distinguish a true emergency. I hear you on the therapist being clearer. I should ask them to clarify instead of assuming they don?t want to help. ?She told them to wait to answer your messages, not wait to read them.? This is very smart and puts me at ease! Thank you!"

176160903,"Im not sure who said chances are slim for morbidly obese people to be healthy again, but it simply isn’t true. Eating clean and excerising are the keys to being healthy. Relapse happens because people lose weight but don’t change how they view food or recover from the addiction. That has always been my issue and Im tackling my obesity from that vantage point this time. There are thousands of anecdotal success stories online of people who went from morbidly obese to healthy. I use WW and the community is also full of people who have successfully gotten healthy."

176160916,Its best to ignore little bit of positive symptoms. The reason is once you up the dose its hard to go back to lower dose. And when you try to go back positive symptoms will be much worse compared to the ones you got while on lower dose. Some people still get occasional positive symptoms even on high dose. Anyway if its bothering you or unable to control then inform your pdoc.
176160917,It doesn’t work for sz.
174383250,"Welcome _AT_MENTION_ ! Recovery will not happen overnight. People recover at different rates but it could take months or years to make progress. I don’t want to discourage you, it is not hopeless. A good insight. Every individual is different with different personalities and everybody’s case of schizophrenia is different but every man and woman on here has lost a lot because of schizophrenia. Again, it’s not hopeless. Many people on here accomplish great stuff despite having schizophrenia. A lot of us work, go to school, live independently, marry, have children, travel, go to movies, go out to eat, exercise etc. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg. I’m not saying you will accomplish all of those but you can certainly do one or more. Progress can be measured in months or years and there’s a chance that you may go backward at some point, but even people without schizophrenia can go backwards in progress. Use all the mental health resources at your disposal. Get a psychiatrist, get a th
erapist if you can, take your medication exactly as prescribed. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot by drinking or doing drugs, they will derail your recovery rapidly and add more problems. We all feel our life was ruined with contracting this disease, but it’s not a black & white thing. Having schizophrenia adds difficulties but it’s not the end of the world. It’s a different kind of life having schizophrenia but we still do normal things. Hell, I got up early and went grocery shopping and then I have some extra money so I drove to the mall to buy whatever luxury that looked good. All I found was some wipes for cleaning cars for $3.00. So I bought those and a coke and on my way home I made an unplanned stop and bought a couple things for my apartment. I fixed a good dinner and I will probably go out later. I do a lot of normal things as does most of us. Spending 8 months in the hospital was kind of weird when I was 21 but at age 58 that’s history and tomorrow I go to work, my class starts soon, I have 
an apartment to myself until they stick a roommate in here, I drive my car all over, and take care of myself. We are unlucky to have this disease but we can adjust. I wish you good luck. Welcome again."

176160927,A reasonable point . It’s often said that there can be factors that have a negative effect when a person takes an IQ test .

It is easily Googleable and was created long before the current tragedy. Please would you be so kind as to confirm that it is indeed racist rhetoric, and or that I am misquoting it. The two papers that claim otherwise both published recently (the one you post and another I had seen) and both use lung cancer data. If ACE2 were to predispose people to lung cancer then it may be that lung cancer genomes have no, or less, geographical heterogeneity. By the way, I have lived most of my life in Japan (33 of 55 years), have no intention to leave, and consider my family to be Japanese or at the very least, they do.

176161023,"From November 1992-April 1993. I was supposed to obtain record details from patient records. They were old records going back to the 1800’s, handwritten and tied up with ribbons. I read their stories. They weren’t criminals, they were people being abused. Do you think a historian could have gone through those records and written things down? No, they just destroyed it all, probably for the liars, trying to rewrite history and victimize victims. They destroyed the buildings too. Which was a beautiful place. It should have been restored."

174383279,"There is a subtype for SZ called deficit SZ. These people have severe negative symptoms, but these people are mainly born during the summer. I think some schizophrenics(me included) have boredom worse than some other schizos, and it’s just harder to treat.

He’s honestly trying."
174383274,"On Invega I experienced a lot of side effects, the ones I couldn’t live with were the apathy and lack of motivation. I just felt blah all the time. Because of the lack of motivation everything around me fell apart because I just didn’t care to do anything to take care of things like housekeeping. I always felt as if I was in a fog. With Aristada my entire personality is back to what it was before I got very sick and had a breakdown. I’m clear headed, can concentrate, feel motivation, and emotions again. My friends say I show more enthusiasm and am animated when speaking. I’m on Aristada 441. This is my first month. Oh, I know it takes care of all my positive symptoms because I was off Invega for 6 months and the sza symptoms were coming back. Aristada took care of them, including the mood swings from the bipolar part of my sza."

176161028,"Because getting better is not the same as making a full recovery. I believe most schizophrenics have the potential to learn to manage their disease and symptoms better, but that a full recovery is out of the question.

I remember rumbles of “when you hallucinate” determines your dx. Like schizophrenics always have psychosis off meds, szas often have psychosis off meds but not 24/7, while bi polars only have psychosis during a episode But haven’t heard much about that in a while. And I forget exactly what was said… I’d say diagnosis is overrated. I’m sza bipolar type but mood stabilizers were like sugar pills to me. Zoloft/abilify/naltrexone/klonopin/d3 has saved my life.

174383309,"TL;DR while both sexes benefited from the NAC, female rats received extra protection. NAC was administered to rats around puberty after they had been subject to an agent mimicing viral infection in early life. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Sex influences in the preventive effects of N-acetylcysteine in a two-hit animal model of schizophrenia. AS _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England) , Sep 26 2019 Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder influenced by patient sex. Mechanisms underlying sex differences in SCZ remain unknown. A two-hit model of SCZ combines the exposure to perinatal infection (first-hit) with peripubertal unpredictable stress (PUS, second-hit). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been tested in SCZ because of the involvement of glutathione mechanisms in its neurobiology.We aim to investigate whether NAC administration to peripubertal rats of both sexes could prevent behaviora
l and neurochemical changes induced by the two-hit model.Wistar rats were exposed to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (a viral mimetic) or saline on postnatal days (PND) 5-7. On PND30-59 they received saline or NAC 220?mg/kg and between PND40-48 were subjected to PUS or left undisturbed. On PND60 behavioral and oxidative alterations were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum. Mechanisms of hippocampal memory regulation such as immune expression of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER), ?7-nAChR and parvalbumin were also evaluated.NAC prevented sensorimotor gating deficits only in females, while it prevented alterations in social interaction, working memory and locomotor activity in both sexes. Again, in rats of both sexes, NAC prevented the following neurochemical alterations: glutathione (GSH) and nitrite levels in the PFC and lipid peroxidation in the PFC and striatum. Striatal oxidative alterations in GSH and nitrite were observed in females and prevented by NAC. Two-hit induced hippo
campal alterations in females, namely expression of GPER-1, ?7-nAChR and parvalbumin, were prevented by NAC.Our results highlights the influences of sex in NAC preventive effects in rats exposed to a two-hit schizophrenia model."

I could feel them touching me and forcibly kissing me. I prayed to God for it to stop and for them to go away and it stopped. I keep forgetting I have Ativan I should’ve just taken that.

Marked rigidity is a known “symptom” Hallucinations ofcourse will also make us loose sleep. Actually being tense or rigid all the time would also make us more exhausted as well to so I guess these factors just intensify the degree of the other problems

174383339,"This author has some info on sulforaphane. He uses it for his autistic son. He uses a particular brand made in Australia, which is very expensive. He does say it takes effect in about 30 min for his son. epiphanyasd.blogspot.com Sulforaphane Research in Japan – Cognitive Deficits and Schizophrenia Sulforaphane Research in Japan – Cognitive Deficits and Schizophrenia Sulforaphane is not a stable substance and so you are wasting your money buying most supplements. Even most types of broccoli powder, which should be a precursor to Sulforaphane (SFN), were shown to be ineffective in independent lab tests. epiphanyasd.blogspot.com How to make Sulforaphane (Broccoli) at home How to make Sulforaphane at home Broccoli sprouts are a convenient and rich source of the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin, which can generate the chemopreventive agent, sulforaphane. How to make Sulforaphane Eating Broccoli Broccoli does contain glucosinolate and the required enzyme myrosinase. If you eat copious amount of raw brocc
oli or very lightly cooked (steaming for 2 minutes) you will produce Sulforaphane in your body. The amount required would be literally pounds/kilos each and every day, to come close the therapeutic doses. Frozen broccoli has no active myrosinase and over-cooked broccoli has no myrosinase. Clever tricks developed to get round this include:- Eating a small piece of raw broccoli (to provide myrosinase) with your cooked broccoli Adding a tiny amount of daikon radish to frozen broccoli. This is really a great idea, since only 0.25% Daikon is needed, you get 99.75% broccoli and will never even notice or taste the daikon. It was shown that broccoli seeds and broccoli sprouts (5 day old broccoli) contain highly concentrated amounts of glucosinolate and the required enzyme myrosinase. It is reported to be about 20 times higher in sprouts than full grown broccoli. Broccoli sprouts are eaten uncooked and so no myrosinase is lost in food preparation. He says one of the researchers eats a few ounces of raw broccoli sprout
s by putting it in a croissant with cream cheese, which sounds pretty good actually. TL;DR: Supplements are iffy, eating mature broccoli has some sulforaphane, but not enough to be therapeutic. It’s still healthy though. Broccoli sprouts seem to be the way to go."

176161263,"The $110.00 an hour pdoc said very little. I did most of the talking. I just wasn’t ready to benefit from psychotherapy. I think he followed the classical, Freudian approach to psychotherapy, where the analyst is the passive recipient of the patients conversation, and they are supposed to somehow project there neurosis onto the pdoc, and then have some kind of purging of the psyche. I talked about the same thing over and over in psychotherapy, mainly because I couldn’t think of anything else to say. Psychotherapy costs too much to sit there and say nothing. The $25.00 an hour pdoc was more interactive, and I got more benefit from him. He wasn’t as dour as my other pdoc."
176161264,what was your experience
176161265,Yeah i will comply with my treatment
176161266,"I have had a lot of rumination over the years. I define it as small fragments of thought that branch to related topics frequently. In a way it is like worry. I do not choose to be this way, but that is what I get. Rumination fills my mind, but I think good thinking would be better."

Therapy? What kind of therapy if so. ECT? Kind of thinking trying ect heard it has good results let me know what worked for you and what medication if so. Also is yours real or not?
176161272,"You should know every one reacts differently to different medications. Other people’s experience is not reflective of yours. Wellbutrin is stimulating and when I took it last time I only sleep 7 hours a day and I am incredibly alert and focused. I was on 300 mg. However, the increased alertness came at the cost of anxiety so I stopped it."

176161277,I feel worthless constantly. My therapist told me to try doing things 5 minutes at a time. She said anyone can stand to do anything for 5 minutes. It does work. Sometimes I get started and keep going. Those are great days. But most of the time I’m stuck. Maybe you can try 5 minute tasks. Do a little of each thing you can think of needing to be done for 5 minutes. Or choose the most important things and do them for 5. You might get more done than youthink.

176161281,"I take it mostly sometimes I forget, _PERSON_ ended up at the police station when _PERSON_ skipped them so I keep careful almost got sent to the psyche ward. Don’t stop your meds its completely stupid."
176161282,I came to believe it when the meds started working and I processed how much crazy stuff I had been through. Took me 3 hospitalizations but after that I no longer thought I was a secret medical test subject or an enlightened person or a sort of biblical prophet. It is always going to be a thing where I have to take meds every day and I hope the negatives and cognitive symptoms don’t get worse however I feel they are.

Even if you have to cut the pills in half or a quarter. IMHO many of us need an objective third party to determine if we are doing well or not, you might be OK self evaluating though if you’ve been doing it for a while."

176161291,Sigh. I had yet ANOTHER dream about the job that I lost last night. It has been nearly two years since it happened and I’m still having dreams about being back there. They are very vivid dreams too. I can smell the smells back there and the dreams are always something along the lines of I’ve gotten my job back and I’m so thankful to have my job back. These dreams are plaguing my sleep. It’s unbearable.

Works both for SD and insomnia. I would recommend promethazine instead of ambien. You get very addicted to ambien. I still love the drug"
176161296,"I thought I was going into some sort of state of after life during my first psychotic break and that part of that process was rebuilding the world…and that that was happening at my stay at the in house patient care thing. I think my skepticism about the state of reality resolved itself maybe within 6 months but I was still unsure because the hallucinations seemed like miracles. In the end I decided that if I had infact joined the afterlife I would’ve experienced something more then medical rooms and sitting on a computer dealing with disability and lawyers once I sought out disability. The major delusions stopped inside the hospital once I was medicated, but just that nugget of doubt about reality lasted for 6months. Now I feel that I’m not delusional in any regard."

174383347,"Because some people actually prefer to be treated without (constant) meds and do better that way, and there is hardly room for that here. I think in some places, there might be things that are better. Such as, making wild guesses now, more social cohesion, more valueing of rituals, less disconnect from nature and less pressure to be extremely efficient and organised. Ideally countries would learn from each other. I do think it is important if meds are available, but i think there are other important things that might be overlooked here."

176161308,Are you stable on your medication? Do you want to keep your medication the way it is? Or do you need a little tweaking? keep current medications make big changes make a little adjustment add an additional med other polls are for chumps 0 voters
176161309,"Welcome to the forum! You need to see a psychiatrist and say everything to them that you just told us. If she cuts you short, say I have more symptoms I still need to tell you. Be sure to advocate for yourself. It’s tough, but it’s the only way to get the help you need."
176161310,that’s terrible. I’m so thankful I don’t have that problem. I remember when I felt like other people (in my head) were controlling what I did. I had a therapist tell me I was in charge during a psychotic episode and I took it to heart and regained control of my head. She really helped me out. I hope the same for you. Do you take an anti-psychotic? If you get a good one it should help with that.
176161311,"I lived and took care of my grandmother for some time.

Now on my new psychologist. I think she does not know that I can’t sleep good. But I told her. I just had my first appointment with her this month. But I’m going from imense feeling of tiredness to an increased amount of being woke up and ready to do something. Both things just last for a couple of minutes."

176161319,_PERSON_ that’s possible maybe akathisia but I will take Benzatropine for that.
176161320,They are the ones who know. Why not get a bit organised and try to take your meds same time every night. I’m a big believer that your body adjusts to them and it seems to work well for me. I still have breakthroughs but I’m better able to deal with them these days.

176161322,"I currently am seeing my second peer support specialist. My first one was better because we could relate to each other. She has bipolar and had been psychotic for an extended period of time before they got her meds right. My current peer had treatment for being transgendered, and having depression and anxiety. So she doesn’t relate to what I’m going through with people telling me what I see and hear are not real. I may end up getting a new peer. I like her, but she’s not helping me much."

Results came back normal: no calcification, no reduced brain matter, no brain damage, no thinning or blocked blood vessels…nothing. In conclusion, my meds did not cause brain damage. I will make a post about meds if more people are concerned that their brains are damaged due to AP. Again, psychiatric meds do not cause brain damage!"

174383366,"Now I have recollected everything. Step-wise learning in regards to Mathematics also varied over time. I was cycling between relatively better periods and worse periods. When I took the P Exam (Actuarial) I was going through a bad period. I could only focus for 5 days. For the FM Exam, though, I was able to get 10 days or so in. I retained a lot of steps from the FM Exam, but not many from the P Exam. When I was taking Linear Algebra, it was a good period. That is maybe why I loved this branch of Mathematics. It was just tricks rather than proofs. Proofs require more step-wise learning, and, possibly, more memory. I actually quite liked Regression Models because it was related to Linear Algebra. So, the brain is very dynamic in nature: It is plastic and changes very fast in my case. I am certain my ability to encode step-wise information in the brain would change very fast. That could be because my Bipolar is Rapid-Cycling. What this means is that at best I am at my 60 percent and at worst I am at 
my 20 percent. My looks could change within 5 minutes, too. I would look like many different people variously. I am trying to work out other symptoms, too. The one’s that relate to step-wise learning. Whether they were as capricious as well. I would say that these deficits have existed throughout my life, with both good and bad periods. Only that the general trend worsened over time. I wonder what was happening at Columbia University, though. I was drinking 8 cups of coffee in a day, didn’t feel like doing much, and was obsessed with cricket. Actually, I was obsessing about cricket from much before, but more so in Columbia University. I was fixated with coming out with ideas to improve my team’s performance. But, when I would go to the library, I wouldn’t just be able to initiate focus. That would be Depression with Manic features concurrently, with the Psychosis in the background. Nobody was able to pick these things because the reasoning was in tact. I am happy that the reasoning part has still rema
ined in tact despite the Clozapine. I am just wondering if I can restore my step-wise learning ability with my new medications. I have improved my memory recall significantly in the last 10 days. I used this as an algorithm: To get the memory recall back by inculcating words first. Then the next month to do some Mathematics with the memory restored. I am able to focus now like never before. I have taken the GRE twice before. One time it was 5 days of study and the second time it was 3 days of study. Right now I have 2 months, though. I just want to see how I do now. But, I am out of touch with all the intellectual stuff since the last 9 years. The question is whether I can replenish my aptitude. I have to re-build my executive functions hard and fast."

We are treated for a dopamine imbalance in our brains, but the effects of high levels of dopamine are pretty different from schizophrenia. They describe people with high dopamine levels as extroverted, often feeling intense pleasure from activities. But a lot of the symptoms don’t seem to fit and are often polar opposites of the experiences of someone with sz. Is there even a well recognized answer for the question?"

Then I got to meet my grandmother which was great because a family feud had split our family a long time ago but my Granddad’s death brought us together again… then said grandmother gets Alzheimer’s within a year and is dead within another year. Both my stepdad’s parents are still alive. I get jealous of that sometimes. They’re the closest things I have to grandparents now. After seeing them both die I’ll be happy if Schizophrenia is the worst thing I ever get. Do you ever have dreams about him? I had a dream about a month after my grandfather died where I was with him in his apartment and he said he had to leave. I asked him where he was going and he didn’t respond. Then he hugged me and I woke up crying.

176161471,"_AT_MENTION_. I’m doing it at a clinic _AT_MENTION_ They put a cap full of electrodes on your head to measure the strength of your brainwaves from 5 frequencies: Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta, and High Beta. After that, a Doctor(I think a Chiropractic Neurologist) goes over your brain chart with you and you tell him what you want from this treatment and he tells you what he’s going to work on and what parts of the brain he’s going to improve. This is done by wearing glasses that have 6-8 strobe lights surrounding your eyes that have different frequencies(you’re wearing a couple of electrodes still, to measure overall brain activity during the session) and you watch at tv show(to keep you busy for 30 minutes) while the screen lights or darkens depending on if your brain is responding to the neurofeedback or not. It’s like a signal(dark) that tells your brain this is the wrong frequency or if it’s right(bright). Each session is for 30 minutes and you can watch whatever tv show/movie you want 
on (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+). I think you can even bring your own media. You do 20 sessions before they rescan your brain again. Then the Doctor tells you how far you’ve gotten and you guys put a plan together of what you want to do next _AT_MENTION_ That’s good man _AT_MENTION_ I’m doing this for anhedonia, and so far so good _AT_MENTION_ I started feeling less fatigue after the first session. I never stay in bed anymore, unless I just want to take a break from the computer. I can actually now sit at a computer all day without feeling tired. After the second session, I’ve noticed that I can increase in resistance weight during my workout at the gym(used to only be only after a few days to a week. I felt like I was beasting it the entire time. People were even watching me with girls checking me out(this was way more than usual). After I left the gym, I went to best buy and some girl was straight up like “what’s up” and I was like dude this is awesome. Basically, my fatigue has lessened over time, 
and dang, I even took a break(in between moving and switching jobs) for a month, and when I came back, on my 8th session, a dramatic increase of my mood. I hate asking for more since I’ve already have such good results(I normally like to go with bare minimums just so I can reserve more of what I need later on), but apparently you can only get lasting results if you go for at least 20 sessions. I took a month break(had to switch jobs) and I didn’t notice losing anything. Immediately when I came back was when my mood lifted tremendously, and it’s lasting pretty well so far."

176161489,IDK. I think that docs are being people pleasers sometimes and take people off their meds because they know that’s what patients want and it makes the patient happy. It may be conjecture but I also think that docs don’t like having to tell younger people they will most likely need medication for life. I think docs can’t (or don’t want to) accept that clients need medication for life.

174383401,"Firstly, also not only not wanting to sound rude, but also not being rude. If what I have written here strikes you as being a psychotic break word salad, then sorry, but either you skim-read it, or your comprehension skills aren’t quite up to the job. I addressed this same comment earlier, several times. Normal? - Longs to be in a universe where “truly just” is the new normal. No, I’m not normal. What I encountered during “phase 1”, on “night 1”, would have put 99% of humanity to its knees. Me however…“NO!!! IT JUST DOESN’T WORK!!!”. So, no, I do not consider myself “normal”. I know the “write a lot” bit was a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but if I had, as you suggest, given the “text” version rather than the “Reader’s Digest” version it would have looked something like this: “God came to me one night. Told me I was “Jesus” (second coming), then the devil, and then god. I told him to get stuffed. I expected it all to end there, but it didn’t. Is this 
typical of Bipolar-schizophrenia?” A lot of help that would have been. I would have gathered so much information. Short, sweet, to the point…Pointless. Besides which, it’s easier for me to be just “sick”, I’m just curious/gathering information. It’s foolish to pick a side before you have all of the information, no matter how appealing the argument for “your” side happens to be. Something you had no idea about, could suddenly come to light, and… So, I’m a skeptic, big deal. I’ll tell you this though: If God turns out to be real, I’ve done nothing wrong but reject him. If he’s truly just too, no problem, if he isn’t…Now there’s a “DUN-DUN-DUN” for you. Just for you, I’ll leave that thought there. Nice and short, but what do I mean? Wordiness is not always the result of a psychotic break, it can also be necessary here and there,"

I’d walk up and down the track at night with a pail of snow, shovel, and backpack with water. I’d pack snow into the gouges in the track and spray them down so they froze smooth. We used to ride shovels down the track in the dark. You’d sit in the bucket and use the handle for a brake. I got clocked doing about 65 mph one night. Manager eventually caught me and my goose was cooked. Totally worth it."

Like inserted thoughts, but in sentences, not impressed images on my mind as mere thoughts are. I do have external hallucinations like phone sounds or mumbling or murmuring, but only once in a while. But is my voices really auditory hallucinations even though they are silent talking? It does feel like talking but with no external sound.

Perfectionists tend to be unhappy (they can never reach their goal of being “perfect”) and do poorly in life because they tend to quit when something comes along that gives them difficulty. They lack resilience. That said, the good news is that perfectionism is a learned condition, not something a person is born with. So it can be unlearned.

176161626,My son when he was much younger asked where the babies came out. My friend was pregnant. I told him women had a special place where the babies came out. Next time we visited her he thought the baby came out of her mouth.
176161627,I should quit internet stuff for my families sake. Do you think it matters? Being active on internet or not.
176161628,I’ve dealt with lies that the voices tell. This is the same.
176161629,I love the irony that on the poll about ADHD you made an error on a minor detail that would be typical of someone with ADHD. Poll should work now.
176161630,Well done my friend. You deserve something and anything is a bonus. My record was 5 years so I know the drama about changing jobs. Always had a good interview technique so getting one wasn’t a problem. Sticking with them was hard for a prodromal sz person. Well done _AT_MENTION_ . Glad your doing well and that makes my heart happy. I like it when people I like do well.
176161631,It’ ‘Yea’… . …
176161632,I see. Hopefully you have an older phone that needs upgrading.

176161636,"that’s kinda how i am, if my neighbors say hello i do say hello back but don’t like to get into conversations with them. one less funeral to go to later in life."
176161637,Being crazy is just a different perspective or view point.
176161638,"Cool, Thanks for the reminder rogue cheers"
176161639,"Not sure it was either. Kinda in a grey zone. I was in the state hospital when it hit the market, and I was the first one on the adolescent unit to be tried on it. We got to 800 pretty quickly and nothing happened. _PERSON_ said to hell with it, let’s push it. Yeah, still nothing. Coulda been taking a sugar pill. Did absolutely NOTHING for me."

176161640,It’s not really a therapist’s place to hand out a psychiatric diagnosis.
176161641,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I try to be careful not to get depressed. The treatment helps me with this, but not completely. I have to do my part too."
174383447,"I mishear pretty often. Like my brain inserts words that arent really there. Ive been meaning to get my ears checked, maybe i need a hearing aid."
176161642,Yes my nutritionist put me on a low carb diet.
176161643,I too have found a good genre
176161644,"I was walking in front of my board & care home a few years ago and some guy had fallen down, half on the sidewalk and half in the bushes. It occurs to me now he might have been drunk or on drugs. But there were a few people just standing there laughing and talking and ignoring him and I just caught his eye and I reached out my hand and he grabbed it and I pulled him to his feet. He thanked me and walked off. I just wondered why no one else helped him."
174383450,"I just mentioned, for me I can’t live without levothyroxine. Apart from low thyroid problems it makes my negative symptoms worse. I find it too hard to do anything without adequate levothyroxine dose. Some say its because of low thyroid activity but its much more than that so sluggish hardly able to get out of bed. Thought process, movements all so slow when reduce levothyroxine dose just for a day. This is why I mentioned about it as it gives a dramatic improvement in my negative and cognitive symptoms. Usually when thyroid patients skip medication for few days nothing happen but for me even a slight reduction in dose for a day gives sudden loss of energy and other issues."
176161645,I think you’re ok… but championing the fact that your sensitive’reminds me of that scene with _PERSON_ in ‘Bad Teacher’ where she says with conviction ‘that’s not a good thing’ hahaha. Life is hard like my bizarrely single female cousin likes to point out. Just food for thought I know I quoted a movie here. But definitely stick around man!!!
176161646,Me and _AT_MENTION_ made our first rap collab in awhile and it turned out amazing! I made the beat and spit a short verse and he did most of the heavy lifting rapping wise and I think we work together really well! Im feeling really good about this and in general so I hope you all are too Let us know what you think!
176161647,"Online, it says cigs are like $5 something a pack on average in California, but that’s if you get the shitty, crappiest ones. I like _NAME_ and pay $7-8 for those and Marlboro is like $8-9. I try and go to the cheaper stores too. Not sure what to believe anymore online. Anyways, I started making my own and it’s great. Just gotta get some stimulants from my ADHD doctor to cut out the pricey energy drinks and keep my health, weight, and crap in check."
176161648,"perfect weather today. but we have been having a cold april for the last 10 days or so. about 10 degrees lower than average temps for this time of year. so lots of days in the 50’s instead of the 60’s. and cloudy, 50 degree weather with sun is pretty nice but we’ve been getting lots of cloud cover. we are finally starting to pull out of our cold spell. may is my favorite month probably."
174383438,I’m going to be a nurse! I think being schizoaffective means nothing about what job you can or can’t have. Everyone is different in what they can handle. It’s just about knowing your limits. But I think you should be careful not to sell yourself short. Know your limits but don’t give up on your dreams.
176161649,I take two. It really stabilized me. I was able to go back to school and back to work. If that one that is supposed to treat negatives comes out next year I am going to ask for a 3rd.
176161650,You dont take benzos like some people on here? Maybe an anti anxiety med would help.

176161653,I’m just concerned that euthanasia debates will put ideas into vulnerable peoples heads.
176161654,If you improve things According to your Unusal beliefs Is that really progress?
176161655,Only if you do it with your left hand. ……… Just kidding. My personal belief is that only if you do it to excess will it harm your mental health. There is the theory that pornography objectifies women. They say that the women’s movement is split down the middle about that. I think that worrying excessively about masturbation could give you an obsession with it.
176161656,Delusions are part of a psychosis but please don’t try to get caught up in trying to label yourself… it can do more harm than good as it did in my case …

174383448,"It takes a lot of effort and determination to take care of yourself. You have to find something that will self motivate you. When I lived alone, it was really hard for me to want to take care of myself. Everyday I wrote a goal, one simple thing, that I wanted to do that day. And I taped it to my bathroom mirror so I looked at it several times. Some days I didn’t achieve that goal, but when I did I felt so good about myself that I wanted to do more. It became easier to take care of myself, because it made me feel good about myself when I did. It takes a lot of time and is a struggle."
176161667,"what do you mean by that? doubt it, I deceived you all and I am sorry for that"
176161668,I read your entire post but am not sure what you are trying to say. Are you saying that your voices are actually other people and that they force schizophrenics into suicide and such?

I don’t have too bad cognitive symptoms, although I took an IQ test by a psychologist two years after I was diagnosed, and my IQ dropped over 40 points (143 to 100) from my premorbid score. Although I think my IQ would be still very high now because at the time I took the test, I was recovering from a severe manic/psychotic break that resulted in 4 hospitalizations, was on a med (Lamictal) that made my thinking very dull and scattered, I hadn’t gotten good sleep at all, AND the IQ test was given after literally 5 whole hours of nonstop psychometric testing so I was burnt out and guessed on most of them because I just wanted to go home."

176161676,I have lost good jobs and social standing as a result of my psychosis.
176161677,I’ll be blunt : you sound delusional. Magic isn’t real.
176161678,"I wouldn’t worry about it too much. Just do what you enjoy doing. Chances are if you are stuck inside all day you will start to want to get out more.

176161681,How did you get over it?
176161682,So after my holiday indulgences and a dose of the flu I’m back under 100kgs again. It’s time to get serious so I’ve been having a decent milkshake ( ie a healthy milk additive ) for breaky. It’s not a diet shake but it’s just a healthy alternative. I need to do more cardio and I’m watching more of what I eat. Damn. This is a marathon this losing on antiphychotics but feeling well and doing good!
176161683,I only have negatives.
176161684,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ He’s off his meds.
176161685,"Xeplion is just the uk name for Invega - yes its the same drug, or its chemical name Paliperadone, which is Risperadone that does not need to be metabolised by your liver. It does make you flat - but ive been on 150mg for quite a few years, and i think you will probably find your sex drive will creep back slowly - after youve developed a tolerance to it. As far as erections go - mine are non-existant, but im on other Aps as well - and you may well fair differently."
176161686,My upstairs neighbor say I might hurt her. Why won’t they leave me alone? I say nothing to them I ignore them best I can. I’m wondering if crisis center will help. What does it mean?
176161687,Three years. Would like to not be involved with them anymore to be honest with you. Hopefully at some point I’ll have a family of mine own and I’ll be recovered… ?

174383461,I am currently on invega sustenna and cannot ejaculate any sperm when I orgasm. How do i make sperm while taking invega sustenna? Would switching to abilify solve this issue?
176161696,No but isn’t it the same as Risperdal? Risperdal is converted to Invega in the body.
174383463,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ , I really appreciate that. Really. This thread ain’t a shining example of me at my best, but I do appreciate the recognition. I like getting recognition from the older folk, we have a lot of shared experience in common from just surviving so long, schizophrenic or not."

176161699,it is pointless to take vitamin supplements if you dont have defficiency. most of them will be flushed down the toilet or not absorbed into cells. If you really want to waste your money just pick up cheapest mult-vitamin option and that is it. Super high doses wont make a difference and those pills are all the same. Only balanced diet and intake of variety of foods can really supplement your body with vitamins.
176161700,"I was worried about serving sizes before, but didn’t do much about it, except for myself when I was trying to lose weight. Now that I need to calculate insulin for my son based on his carb intake, I’m darn near obsessed w8th portion sizes. I bought 2 new sets of measuring cups to make sure my sizes are correct. The one set I got because they were oblong, came with spoons, and were pretty colored."
176161701,I always viewed diagnosis as a starting place from which they try a lot of different med’s and different therapies. Mental illnesses are to complex and to varied to fit into a box.

176161708,I really like it. Lovely liveliness to it
176161709,I think structure and purpose is very important to recovery…when you drift aimlessly…that’s when you get into trouble.
176161710,Well my new pdoc said I could take 400mg. What??? I was taking 100mg. What do you think about that?
176161711,Same here.but luckly i don t have any depression or suicidal thoughts with medication.but i m little bit afraid of this artificial disneyland happiness.i think this is not ok too but its better than deep suicidal depression of course.

176161716,"Does anyone feel like their Rights have not been upheld on this forum? all the various Charities as far as the eye can see who work with disadvantaged people are bound by a set of rules about how they treat people, all of these organisation have to sign a contract stating that they will follow these rules so that no-one is treated unfairly, The rules are there to uphold the rights of the individual who receives care or support from the organisation, I’m guessing the volunteers on this site have not had any formal training about how to uphold a persons universal rights. maybe it is time to offer some sort of training as a guide so they can be 100% sure that they are making the right decisions regarding the regulation of this forum. _AT_MENTION_ It makes sense to make sure people are given the proper care and support, also i was wondering if mods had access to a counselling service in case they are struggling with the work they do here. this can be a good tool to maintain good mental health for our 
mods."

174383459,"scientia.global – 9 Oct 19 Dr _NAME_ - _USER_ID_ Opioid Receptors: A New Treatment Target for... Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder that affects around 1% of the global population, producing debilitating symptoms that significantly impact upon the quality of life of sufferers. Even with treatment, prognosis is often poor with a high... The researchers argue that the _USER_ID_ opioid receptors may be over-activated in people with schizophrenia, leading to changes in dopamine levels that cause too little activation in some parts of the brain but oversensitivity in others. These complex effects are proposed to underlie the range of different types of symptoms (i.e., the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms). Dr _NAME_ and colleagues suggest that by preventing this over-activation of the _USER_ID_ opioid receptors, it is possible to treat more of the symptoms of schizophrenia than has been possible with existing pharmacological interventions."

Horrible withdrawals for me are depression and catatonia (which I guess can happen if being discontinued). But I rarely take the extra 300mg and used to forget to take the med all the time."
176161735,It’s in this news article that I’ve posted right at the bottom of the subtitle 'what are the concerns? ’
176161736,I have difficulties socialising. It depends on the person though. Some people I feel more comfortable around and some people I can not stand being around and that doesn’t necessarily mean I don’t like them .i can love someone but not be able to stand being around them. I was invited to a family dinner today but had to say no thank you. T Too many people were going to be there and many of them think they are superior to me and expect me to salute them or something which is against my beliefs and on top of that last time I went there I went mute and uncomfortable and my body started twitching because I felt so awkward. I could not feel relaxed and happy but instead suffered being with family . I actually can suffer being around my own parents but they have always hated me although I believe they love me a bit too. It doesn’t matter if they are strangers or I know them. I can feel more comfortable around some strangers than I do my own family. I hate that I can and have gone mute. It is such a aw
ful feeling and the other people/person is expecting you to speak and you can’t get any words to come out. Sometimes it’s just blank but mostly I feel really uncomfortable and awkward etc There’s a woman at one of my volunteer positions who wants power over me and suppresses me or tries to. I feel really uncomfortable around her and that it’s not ok for her to boss me about and ask me to do things I can’t do. Most of the others I volunteer with are more confident in who they are or don’t feel the need to treat me that way.they treat me as their equal and with respect and are patient and kind to me not like this awful pregnant woman all powercrazed. Hope I don’t have to quit because of her and how she treats me. I managed to hold a conversation for at least ten minutes last week with a woman I volunteer with and it was so lovely.i was so happy about it.and also with another and a couple others.it made me so happy to be able to have a chat.even if it was short. Also I’m not so educated and don
t keep up with the news so I have difficulties with those types of conversations too. Keep it simple with me perhaps. Although some of the woman I volunteer with spoke politics and I could keep up with their way of talking.i didn’t talk like they but I did ask one question and could understand what they were saying. I love those woman I volunteer work with. We could probably not be friends but I love meeting them once a week but now I can’t find parking so holly knows if I can keep going. How did I ever have friends? How do I go with my own family not very well. I’m awkward with my bro n sis who also want power over me and like I’m everyones bi tch in restraint or a lead or something n I don’t want to be so humiliated ha ha ha ha but the animals are treated badly doesn’t make the abuser superior. I can switch off often too when I just can’t follow or understand what they are saying. I can get so exhausted from being with people and I do avoid it but am understanding towards myself and say no to 
dinners and other social events and leave if I don’t feel well such as last week I left one of my volunteer positions because this pregnant woman was being awful to me and it made me feel awful so I left .

176161771,"Philosophy and psychosis have more in common than many people (philosophers especially) might care to admit. The similarity is not what you might think-that philosophy and psychosis don’t have rules, and you’re tossed around the universe willy-nilly. On the contrary, each is governed by very strict rules. The trick is to discover what those rules are, and in both cases, that inquiry takes place almost solely inside one’s head. And, while the line between creativity and madness can be razor thin (a fact that has been unfortunately romanticized), examining and experiencing the world in a different way can lead to sharp and fruitful insights. This is why I recommend psychoeducation in addition to psychotherapy, it’s really helped me. Therapists who not only treat but also give us theoretical insights into the causes of specific symptoms. Knowledge and reflection has a way of straightening out the circuits of the mind."

And my brother and his wife said that they just wanted and ease on the taxes, and they’re not planning to go to the church. The most social I get with my family is vacation in poland on christmas.

174383481,"I am thirty-one. It happened when I turned fifteen. I was in a small boarding school. But I can’t remember much. I think this girl who was my roommate was mad. Because I liked a guy she was with. He was coming onto me. The school was expensive/but also stupid. Like being at summer camp with no rules. I had reported harassment/bullying. They hired a therapist for me. It didn’t help, because the teachers joined in with the bullying from the senior guys. I was a freshman. So the girl gave me three round white pills to help me fall asleep, it was a “sleepover” and this was after other moments I have trouble remembering, it was January, snowing and right after my birthday. The gaslighting just kept getting more and more intense. Screaming my name when I passed them in the hall, grabbing my hands, trying to untie my shoelaces. I was a size zero. My other roommate before that said the guy was watching me change from the windows of the dorm outside. So I took the white pills to help me sleep, I hea
rd knocking from inside the closet. Then darkness. I woke up in a different bed, my bed. It was two days later. I didn’t remember anything. I walked outside in the snow. Then I froze in place. I stood there in silence for hours thinking that I was angry at them, they were going to eat me alive and feeling afraid/distressed. I went into the greenhouse, must have had a flashback but I started screaming. And I recall flashbacks of screaming, being assaulted, but they came upon waking like lucid dreams or felt out of body. So I couldn’t prove it. The boarding school kicked me out, claimed no knowledge of what happened. But the whole school knew, and I couldn’t remember. Because I think I had been roofied. Until now I haven’t even looked up what a roofie looks like, its’ a round white pill. Like the ones she gave me. I was taken home, felt flashes of pain in my body/heat/like pain but I was not hurt. Just like psychological pain and when I turned the water on the water burned like fire. I thought, maybe 
I was anemic or sick from the camping trip where I also experienced blackouts at night/memory problems. For a week the pain and empty ness never left, i felt hollow and everything was a depressed flaming blur of misery. Everything hurt, like I was glass/shattered. Then I was hospitalized. My parents had consulted a psychiatrist who later diagnosed me with Paranoid Schizophrenia. I never had schizophrenia though. So I don’t know what to do. I have been coerced or pushed into this harsh two month long acting injection of Aristada. It’s made me gain weight. I was a size zero and now I weight 280 pounds probably. I feel like I have gained 20 pounds recently. I want to tell the psychiatrist I was never schizophrenic. He just switched my label from Bipolar to Schizophrenic on suggestion from my parents. My parents really hurt me too by ignoring me for my entire life and saying I was sick. They won’t pay for college and want me to apply for disability for schizophrenia. I have been trapped at my parent’s hou
se, without transportation, no financial support and no way to get away from dependency and no one advocating against the psychiatric system. My dad is also volunteer or head chairman of the board of the state run facility which pays my psychiatrist. I want to tell him I don’t have schizophrenia. But I think it’s going to be more painful than just pretending it’s ok to continue living this misdiagnosed lie. I can’t get out if I don’t get the SSI payments, I won’t be able to move out. My dad won’t give me any money to live on my own and honestly I have trouble managing things because no one ever gave me the chance to manage on my own/ support myself completely. This inner pain has compounded and been extremified by the forced hospitalizations that ruined my future. My family looks at me like I’m a failure. they don’t say it. But they think it. Or it’s the mental illness that’s not my fault, but not one single person listened to me for 16 years since it happened. And It’s eating me alive
. I keep trying to remember. Because If I knew, then that would explain the random “episode” of my trauma and screaming/how I completely lost touch in an instant/just broke down and dissolved into nothing…anger at God, anger at the world for this. Was it my brain, a physical reaction…and I never brought up the pills because I blocked it out for years. So didn’t really convince them I guess, because the psychiatrist ignored me. I have an appointment for a phone conversation tomm with my psychiatrist and I am afraid to say anything about it. I don’t know how to put it. You were wrong. This label had and continues to hurt me. The more I try to convince myself to accept it the more the memories fight to resurface and they are gone, just a void and emptiness that will never make me whole again."

176161861,I know it sounds crazy but I am real.
176161862,I think if you have social anxiety that is just the way it is. Starting another job would not help because you would feel uncomfortable and worried but this time just with a new set of people.

At another time the voices said its all illuminati and there’s an orgy. So I took their election t-shirt and photographed it placing captions with underlying meanings. Good for you that those people didn’t mind. Mine, they made a fuss about it. They told their friends and people who work for them. I’ll always be the freak in high society. They made a movie out 4 movies out of it. I my day I just imagine how they talk about me and it makes me depress"
176161867,If you’re having that reaction to it outwardly just think what it’s doing to your insides. Yes I think you should get a new medicine.

176161870,It’s often a drug people use to self medicate. That usually goes to extremes and becomes a problem. I still enjoy mid strength beer. I don’t drink to get drunk and I don’t drink alone. You can still enjoy the odd drink but it depends on you and your meds.

176161887,i think the best invention is computers. how about you guys.
176161888,I came off my meds on my own once and lied to my psychiatrist about it for weeks. I wouldn’t recommend doing it. It took maybe 2 days for my voices to come back and became delusions again after a few days. Before my meds I didn’t have many delusions but after stopping them the delusions became stronger and it became harder for me to go back on meds over a year to be exact.
176161889,That’s really your worst ever? You’re a good man.

176161895,I think I only see my pdoc around every 2 years now. Apart from that I am pretty much on my own. Too severe for the mental health services in my area and not severe enough for the CMHT.

176161907,Hello peeps. I’m sleepy
176161908,"2 summers ago, I began to have panic attacks for the first time in my life. I had 6 or 7 in 2 or 3 months. not sure why, I mentioned them to my pdoc hoping she would prescribe me a benzo. but she didn’t even seem interested in what I was telling her. so I bought some valerian and catnip tea to take in preparation for my next panic attack. I had a couple more and drank my tea to calm down and would also go soak in the tub and try to calm down. this was somewhat effective. and then they just stopped and I haven’t had one in a year and a half. back when I was having them, I was still having ups, like a few hours a day of planning or starting projects. or feeling compelled to go for a long walk. I no longer have these ups very often as my mood has stabilized and im pretty even keel all day now. I wonder if it was the ups that was causing the panic attacks. with an overactive brain causing paranoid thoughts and subsequent panic attacks."

176161911,"That’s a tough one. Regardless of whether the people are really being nasty or you’re having delusions, your social worker should be supportive and help build you up. Dismissing all concerns as delusional seems counterproductive. But I don’t know you or your case. I like to use a rule of 3s when I do reality testing. If one person is rude to me, they were a jerk. If two people are rude to me, I’m just getting unlucky. If three people are rude to me, I have to acknowledge that the problem is likely me and my own perceptions."
176161912,"There’s much evidence that overall CBT is not that good for psychosis . That doesn’t mean that no one is helped by it. No treatment is unsuitable for all or perfect for all. Whatever the treatment , it’s about whether the effect on a big enough % of people makes it a worthwhile treatment option in terms of cost etc . If, as an individual, you are helped by it you should stick with it., regardless of how it stacks up when measured at a group level."
176161913,One thing is I think on dictionary or thesaurus.com they create for you a map depiction of words that are close in meaning. I really liked that although I’m not sure I even appreciate it as much as I could. Nonetheless I look at dictionary.com all the time.

We aimed to examine the brain structures and functional connectivity in these cognitive subgroups of schizophrenia.We compared brain structures among healthy controls and cognitively deteriorated and preserved subgroups of patients with schizophrenia according to the decline in intelligence quotient. Connectivity analyses between subcortical regions and other brain areas were performed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging among the groups.Whole brain and total cortical gray matter, right fusiform gyrus, left pars orbitalis gyrus, righ
t pars triangularis, left superior temporal gyrus and left insula volumes and bilateral cortical thickness were decreased in the deteriorated group compared to the control and preserved groups. Both schizophrenia subgroups had increased left lateral ventricle, right putamen and left pallidum and decreased bilateral hippocampus, left precentral gyrus, right rostral middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus volumes compared with controls. Hyperconnectivity between the thalamus and a broad range of brain regions was observed in the deteriorated group compared to connectivity in the control group, and this hyperconnectivity was less evident in the preserved group. We also found hyperconnectivity between the accumbens and the superior and middle frontal gyri in the preserved group compared with connectivity in the deteriorated group.These findings provide evidence of prominent structural and functional brain abnormalities in deteriorated patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that cognitive subgro
ups in schizophrenia might be useful biotypes to elucidate brain pathophysiology for new diagnostic and treatment strategies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

174383513,"I havent been on medications since the beginning of october? If i were to hazard a guess it would be october 18 (the day of my aunts funeral, the only reason i remember i suppose). Before that no medications that worked. I only had working medication for a month in september and insurance wont help me. I dont want to explain everything but i have to. I have on top of schizoaffective depressive type, ptsd and my therapist is guessing its caused by either one. I have constant memory problems, bad enough i forget sentence to sentence whats going on, forget about each day. I am having struggles functioning, communicating feels all but impossible at this moment, i struggled to even sign a paper properly today. All the while my head feels like its slowly being crushed; theres no pain. The doctor says its allergies but no allergy pill or pain pill can touch it and it affects everything in my functioning. I cant do anything and its constant since i had to stop the medication in october. The only things tha
t bring me clarity anymore are weed and alcohol. I just want to know what it is; is it dissociation? I cant feel anything really. Or is it something that comes as a symptom of schizophrenia/schizoaffective, as my therapist suggested? It doesnt sound like much because i cant describe it all. But its making my life impossible to live anymore. I am hallucinating, not much but more often these days. I dont know why so little either. Things are very disorganized and its almost painful to connect a fluid thought"

174383518,"The other night I actually stayed up until morning surfing YouTube. Somehow it slipped through the cracks (for me) regarding how great it can be regarding music and movie passages. At first I looked up obvious fare for a guy in my position… such as ‘The Aviator’, ‘Good Will Hunting’, ‘A Beautiful Mind’, ‘The Soloist’, and even “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”. Eventually I found a video that had collected the top 10 movies on Schizophrenia. Sadly there was only one [new to me] that avoided tropes and handled the topic(s) responsibly. (The soloist deserves attention for dropping the ball seemingly). But the one that stood out was an Aussie film from (1995) titled ‘Angel Baby’. I haven’t seen the movie but I ‘shared’ the ‘plug’ with loved ones on my Twitter Feed. This entry is not about dull summation, but more importantly what I LEARNED FINALLY about myself…(And yes you can learn from the mere act of talking/sharing.) I learned that my threshold for embarrass
ment has changed/or even ‘mutated’, (which is a severe word, but in science it’s actually quite neutral.) In the trailer there’s a lot of ‘nakedness’, a person slinking down beside a toilet, and frankly a scene that appears to be public copulation under intensifying lights. Again I learned that I’m angry enough/and it’s important enough, that I’m willing to have a certain ‘nakedness’ illustrate, and/or illuminate others… (Society?). I think we saw this at Woodstock. It’s not funny that I’ve been reciting to myself of late that I possess ‘body heat’ to share with, ahem, a partner. Or that I possess nerve endings to satisfy an ‘adversary’, should I have a bad car accident. To me, it feels quite right to say one way or another we reduce people in my shoes - which normally is a wake up call. There’s still some clothing left I guess, I can’t press on as much as I may wish at times. But I think I put a good face on those with mental illness. And I think it’s a helpful and e
ducational movie to see; I support it. [This entry may not be my best… but still it may have been a long time coming. I’d really like to get it to print.]"

174383523,"I’m praying for that med to come to Portugal I’m also on aripiprazole, I had only one side effect, tardive dyskinesia (I used to give a lot of French kisses in the street to no one ) but my doc prescribe a low dose of risperidone to end it 0.5 mg and I never French kiss anymore on the street to nobody. I just hope that med comes before it’s a generic"
176161983,Yes. Very often.
176161984,"You’re kidding, right? I have my chef’s ticket as it was my first career. I broke my back in a workplace incident and am no longer able to physically manage restaurant work. No way I can scrub out behind the shelves in a cooler or the holding cabinets now (those suckers are heavy to move). When you work in a restaurant if you’re not cooking or prepping, you’re cleaning. There is never downtime. Everyone works hard in a kitchen, even Chef rolls up his sleeves and scrubs stuff down."
176161985,I’m glad to hear things are improving! Awesome news!
176161986,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ I’m feeling a bit better. Drinking some Gatorade. Haven’t had a coffee yet today so I’m going to give that a shot and maybe some crackers.
174383527,"Have you seen a psychiatrist yet? Medication can help. My voice convinced me to pour water on my 1500 dollar macbook air and my upgraded 2 terabyte PS4, destroying both. It also told me to drive fast to prove I was psychic and I slammed into a guardrail and totaled my truck. This was all back in 2015/2016 when I was psychotic, before I recovered from delusions and paranoia. Welcome to the forum, it’s a nice place to find support. The Say Anything thread is a great place to chill and hang out and talk about movies and sports and music and other things to get your mind off your symptoms."
176161987,"It’s time to make new friends and repair your relationships with your family if possible. Hopefully your family can understand that you were ill and at least some of them will want to reconnect. It they don’t than you can make a new family with your new friends. But it takes time and effort. You’ll have to put yourself out there a bit. And you may suffer some rejections, but be strong and keep trying. So start that conversation at the bus stop, talk to that person at the grocery store and look for opportunities to get out in the community like fundraising walks and awareness meetings for various charities like cancer and child abuse. You can do it with just a little creativity and effort. Good luck. I’ll be holding good thoughts for you."
176161988,Glad to hear. Moving to zyprexa was good for my thinking. I am less _USER_ID_ and sharper than I was on risperdal. Stick with it. Improvement takes some time but good early signs is great.

176161991,"I have lived in many places in my life. Now I am living in the small city in Eastern Finland. I have been here nearly 19 years after returning from the USA. I like it and I especially like riding my bicycle in the city. I was born here, just 300 meters from my place at the hospital. It is the nice little city. I have not many relations with people but every now and then I see some people while I ride my bicycle and at the grocery store."
176161992,Sounds like you have a good thing going and you don’t really know if you’ll actually be happier or sadder if you stop working. Maybe you just need a vacation? Doesn’t sound like you’ll die at 62.

176161994,"I have a form of shy person hate. Occasionally I am withdrawn and take internal shots at everything and everybody (in my head). It is like a mood of being irritable. Also, at times I hate people on TV, and I hate the commercials. Sometimes I have stereotypes and I have unfair negative thoughts about entire groups of people. I try to control my hate.

176161999,"I know a lot of people think that way about me. The situation began decades ago. People were somehow looking into my room while the door was shut at college. They were telling (i.e, strongly implying) I should commit suicide to my face. Now they are trying to human traffic me to older men who have an insatiable homosexual lust for me. I’m straight. Until they admit those things and take responsibility for them we are enemies."
176162000,I’m also quitting smoking today with nicotine gums and patches.
176162001,I’ve never heard that. Do you have links? I figure it would depend on the person’s symptoms. Coffee greatly helps my negatives
176162002,"Many here, including myself, worry about how they are doing cognitively.Don’t give up hope it is possible to improve. 15 months or so I had a 75 or so avg IQ for non-verbal/spatial tests.

176162017,"hi _AT_MENTION_. Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Ninjastar Volunteer Moderator"

Also, who on earth contributed to this textbook? As a literature major who had studied citations, this just don’t make sense (in sense of citations) to all of the academic fields of literature, sociology, and psychology combined. Not sure why the editors decided to reference some inappropriate stuff. I’m sure they used APA citation for this and I’m not sure if APA (American Psychology Association) will be happy with this."

The new system has “broad applicability” across the spectrum of neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders, they report in two new scientific papers.

176162079,One psychologist I saw a few years ago said my belief that my mother in law will try to poison me is normal. Something didn’t seem right about it.

I couldn’t sleep that night, and I’ve had insomnia ever since. Now I drink about ten cups of coffee a day, and it has little effect on me. I can still sleep, after a while, even after I’ve had two cups of coffee with supper. Alcohol could be that way for you. You’re system is more sensitive to it because you haven’t drank as prodigiously as an alcoholic does."

176162087,When I was younger I won an award at school for neat handwriting (I’m left handed as well). Every year or so till I was 18 I changed my handwriting all the time. Since I was 18 I had a basic right slant cursive style I still have now. But recently I wrote in capitals and changed from right to left slant. At the moment I am back to right slant and a very scribbly cursive. When I’m hypomanic it gets bigger and messier. When I’m depressed it gets smaller and more scribbly.

My mind is racing so I cant do all that stuff. and do my hair in a timely manner.

When I buy bananas, theyre gone in a day bc the jackass brother freezes them for his smoothies. If I get the shot every 3 weeks, that’s probably more weight!!

176162187,"I know it is scary to go to the doctor alone, but you might need to do it. It can help to prepare in advance. I write down what I want to talk to the doctor about, and any questions I might have. I also keep track of my diet, sleep patterns, and exercise habits,as those are some of the first things doctors will ask about when evaluating new symptoms. For example: hallucinating is a sign that something is seriously wrong. But everyone hallucinates when they are severely sleep deprived. If you are consistently sleeping less than 4 hours a night, your doctor may want to treat your sleep first. If you have certain neurological symptoms during a physical exam, they might want to send you for an MRI to check for brain tumors. And so on. So you can make a list of things you wish to discuss, and write down their answers during the appointment."

176162251,"im finally on stable medication for the first time since i was diagnosed at 16. im 21 now. i am not dealing with any of my past stressors, my paranoia and delusions are under control, my hallucinations no longer impact my life in a way that is detrimental to me. im no longer shut down, i am finally what you would classify as ‘okay’ for the first time in my life but everything somehow feels so wrong. i have never wanted to be medicated, i have always feared medication and refused it, its been a long long battle to be able to take my current meds regularly. i am an artist and thats the main way i express myself, i have never known any other way, but now that im medicated and everything is settled around me i feel like i can no longer draw. my art was how i survived while my life was so consumed by my illness. my world was chaos and thats all i ever knew, and i no longer know how to be an artist without my chaos. has anyone else ever felt wrong after they became stable? i know i should be happy, a
nd i am grateful for the support and help i have been given, but a huge part of me doesnt know how to live without the psychosis, for most of my life it was all i ever knew. i feel like ive just been spit out into the world again and i dont know who i am or how to express myself or what to do."

176162258,"They have bad energy that makes me sick. When they’re around, I can’t have the TV on, because the TV enhances their bad energy. It’s not my imagination. I’ve read on antipsychotic package inserts, that they cause increased sensitivity. Before they knew where I lived, I could sleep with the TV on all night."
176162259,"Yes, AP’S are expensive in South Africa too. My amisulpride and olanzapine and lamotrigine together cost about R2000 (don’t know how much that is in dollars, perhaps $150 or so). I take the minimum dose to save money. I can get my meds free here too, but it involves a whole day’s wait in governmental community clinics. I don’t have the patience to wait all day so I get it privately."
176162260,"Yeah, my siblings still think I am a high intellect, but I think I’ve lost a bunch. I had 41 ECTs many years ago."

176162268,"From what I’ve read, you’re supposed to press the base of the ruler into your pelvic bone when you measure, so that should measure it the same regardless of any fat you have. I’ve never been over 200 pounds though so I’m not sure if that would work out the way I’m thinking."
176162269,"Mine is Zoloft, 150mg per day. I’m not convinced that I need it though."
176162270,I’m interested. What is an example of a delusion that makes you feel safe?
176162271,Have you talked with anybody about this? Maybe a doctor
176162272,"I have 0 motivation, I force myself to walk a bit in my house but I can’t everyday and can’t for long. I stay in bed all day everyday, only get up to eat. In bed either sleep or on this forum. I gained 170lb."

176162288,"Put off taking Lamictal since I got my new pdoc because I’m still not sure about how the interactions will go. I was on 200 mg of Lamictal before being taken off it, but will be splitting the pills in half so my system can get used to it. Is 100 mg a good starting dose? I don’t remember if she said she’d provide me with new Lamictal pills or not but my mom hasn’t received them from the pharmacy if so."
176162289,Theres a movement for people hearing voices called the hearing voices network lots of non schizophrenics hear voices

176162291,What do you do for volunteering?
176162292,"Incels creep me out too. I don’t understand it much though. I am single and can get lonely sometimes, but I don’t think I fit into this category. I am actually quite comfortable and content, but that’s not to say I would say no if I did meet someone. I have never really been that good at all this stuff, so I will sign off!"
176162293,I try to buy and eat fruit every day even if my selections are limited. I only like certain fruits. I also try to eat at least one half plate of veggies every day. I try to throw a whole bag of veggies into the entree that I’m cooking for the day.

176162295,It’s no use regretting the things we couldn’t control in the past…? You can focus on the things you can to make him better! Like giving the eye drops his doctor prescribed and going to the doctors for routine check ups?
176162296,If it was a pathogen then you’d have more than 1%. It’s a genetic trigger getting hit. Otherwise why would countries all around the world have the same pretty much prevalence rate? It’s not a pathogen but it could be caused by genetic triggers getting hit in utero. You need to rethink what your saying!

176162301,Like what issues?
176162302,"Therapy has taught me that when I feel suicidal, I don’t really want life to end, I just want out of my current life situation. I’m sure there’s something that can be done to improve it. And you know, things change. Situations pass. Dying now would be giving up before giving things a chance to get better. It would be robbing their kids of a parent, and having them remember you as the one who gave up the fight and abandoned them. Kids aren’t dumb, I’m sure they know you’re suffering, and I’m sure they want to see you get better. You can get help. There’s therapy, different medications you can try, people you can talk to, groups you can join. There are things that can be done. I know it can get tiring having to fight all the time, but if you put in the time and effort, and don’t give up, I do believe things will eventually improve."
176162303,"I am an introvert so I enjoy spending time alone anyway. Before COVID, I used to enjoy singing in my church choir. Now I stay busy reading and watching sci fi like Star Trek, watch TV and read the newspaper, try new recipes, exercise, play the flute, and organize my home."
176162304,Life is complicated. You have a mental illness that confuses your thoughts and being and it is even more so. Your a good person _AT_MENTION_ . You should be proud of what you’ve done and you don’t need to feel guilty or worry about such things but that is pretty much standard for most of us. It took me a lot of years to be happy about my lot. I didn’t get diagnosed till 29. Lots of wasted years till then. Your young enough to live and move forward! Keep moving forward and be happy with yourself. Your a good egg!
176162305,thanks guys I will take into consideration
176162306,Is it ok if I ask why it wasn’t helpful?
176162307,"Something “significant” happens every single day and I’m sure the 21st won’t be an exception.

176162310,"My wife and brother-in-law got tested earlier this week and came back positive. I got my nose swabbed out of an abundance of caution. The nasal swab was negative, but they also did the nasopharyngeal test, which came back positive today. I was utterly shocked to be told I’m positive. I feel fine. Like, no symptoms at all. Sure, my nose was stuffy in the morning which went away after a half hour, and I had a cough for a few hours, but nothing lined up with COVID symptoms. No fever, no chills, no cough, no taste loss, nothing. My quarantine ends on the 18th. I’m still going to get my second vaccine dose on the 23rd to wrap this horseshit up. I’ve heard enough about COVID for 5 lifetimes. Yargh."
176162311,In _NAME_ he makes minimum wage plus tips which is a good thing because when he worked for the same company here doing the same thing he only got like $2 an hour as a wage. I am not sure what minimum wage is in _NAME_ though. At least he won’t be flat broke.
176162312,"I just want them to go away, I’m not the chosen one, I’m not a ??????? bodhisattva. I just want to be normal, right now I know if I chug this bottle it will put me to sleep and stop the voices, why would I want to stay in this world, oblivion calls, I just want to sleep"
174383598,"I’ve had numerous jobs in the past. Some retail, some hospitality, factory work and the like. But haven’t worked in about a year and a half. Can hardly imagine enduring the stress of working at the moment though. And usually a while after I get some work I have a panic attack or get hospitalised and lose my job."

176162314,Indeed. My brain remembers the voice of my ex psychiatrist and talks to me
176162315,"I read a science article on Facebook that said it takes years for the dead body to decompose. hmmm. never knew that, assuming they would know that."
176162316,It’s worse when the support isn’t forthcoming… It leaves a very bitter taste.
176162317,"I have the same problem, i use sugar free chewing gum during the night, it helps quite a lot"
176162318,"Thanks for saying that Everhopeful. It was very kind. I feel okay and good sometimes, but when I have absolutely nothing I want to do, and then I sleep, I get depressed. In a way I have to take the responsibility for my own activities. I have often believed that “my faith” would solve the problems for me. However, I have been advised by many people to plan various forms of activities. I am going to be watching a lot of baseball this week (the World Series)."
176162319,Champix/chantix works for some. It was the easiest thing I’ve ever done. Didn’t even finish the course but this was before vaping…If you want to give up nicotine then ask your doc to try it. It’s a good agonist for nicotine and I can vouch for it but it can make some sick early. Yes you can get side effects but over here it’s like now up to $30 for a pack of 20’s. It’s ridiculous.
176162320,"I had the worst night in years, fever, aches, copious sweating, non-stop nightmares and feverish closed-eyes hallucinations. So far so good, but what I don’t understand is the sudden drop in my mood. I’ve been feeling tearful, intensely longing for death, aware of being a purposeless abomination. Am I even human? Oddly enough I’m not paying much mind to thoughts about demons, but at the same time the intensity of my death wish has increased. Feeling guilty, worthless, lost in a world I’m increasingly struggling to understand. In fact, I no longer understand anything at all, everything is random, what makes this fabled “me” me eludes me, I don’t know true from false anymore. Can anyone relate to this, perhaps offer some guidance? Sorry about the rant."
176162321,"Generalized anxiety disorder Major depressive disorder High blood sugar (it remains to be seen if it’s caused by prediabetes or full-fledged diabetes; regardless, I’m working to lower it with a healthier lifestyle)"
176162322,"Also many scientific studies are not moral, my psy teacher told us how scientists measured physiological parameters when 2 ppl had sex. I know it looks wrong in society but it helps us.

176162323,"I am almost close to tell you to go look at some other life… you didn’t have my father, you cant understand… I wont blame myself to be at the same place, cause this isn’t even true… Not a single doc never helped, I tried the psychologists… I am now sad…I dont want to hear no more of philosophy in my life!!! I dont progress cause you didn’t have what I had… basta… I am tired to play the nice girl of the forum, while no one can imagine why I went mean etc… Arrividerci!!!"
176162324,That’s a SUPER awesome perspective!!
176162325,"Not textbooks, studies that show people have very vivid memories of things that certifiably never happened. So you don’t need the _PERSON_ effect to explain your false memories. Unless you believe your memory is so exceptional, and so much more accurate than everyone else’s, that you’d never misremember important things. In which case I think you’re delusional."
176162326,I think the mood component effects how the SZ effects the brain. Like with my depressive type there is a certain apathy I feel towards my hallucinations and I think they effect me less because of that I’m not saying it’s the healthiest. But its a thought. Also I’ve noticed when I’m going through bad bouts of depression my sz symptoms dont seem as bad Idk if I’m just too preoccupied with the depression to notice/ care about the sz or if the depression is actually making it less but its something id love to study more
176162327,"I took a bath I haven’t had any nicotine today I haven’t killed anyone because of it, lol"
176162328,Thanks! I actually did call them and spoke with a guy for like 45 mins and then every hour and half he would call for a 10 min conversation and see how I was doing
174383599,"When I was on Abilify I didn’t really gain weight. Well I gained a bit but it felt like my natural weight. I ate and ate and still didn’t get too fat. But I did walk a lot and was very active. The only down side for certain people is sexual dysfunction and boredom. Also Abilify can cause addictive personality in certain people. That’s why I quit it. But no, I wouldn’t say I was over weight."
176162329,"I used to have these unusual beliefs, but with the help of my doctors I have learnt that’s not real. That’s not true. It’s imposible. Maybe you should call your psychiatrist."
176162330,"Dude. Just stay away from him. You don’t want to get evicted, especially when you have no evidence that he is harassing you. Retaliation is frequently punished more harshly in these situations."
176162331,"I’ve read a lot of posts where people talk about their delusions and refer to them as that - delusions, but then go on to talk about them like they completely believe in them. It seems as though on one hand they know that what they believe is called a “delusion” but they lack the insight to recognize how insane their ideas truly are. I had delusions during psychosis but other than that I can completely recognize when something is just not true. Am I missing something here or does anyone feel the same way while reading some of these topics?"
176162332,Why thank you. I just love color on anything really
176162333,"It takes a while to get used to a new job, but this woman sounds like the supervisor from hell. It could be that she wants to put you down as a part of a power trip. If you have recourse you might try it. If that doesn’t work you have to decide if the pay is worth the pain."
176162334,"Nah, I don’t mind. They are pretty nice and sometimes I talk with them about the pharmacology, etc (I’m interested in pharmacy). I’m so nerdy my girlfriend just rolls her eyes lol"

176162336,"I lost 40 lbs through calorie counting, but I had to severely limit myself. I was pretty miserable the whole time.

176162337,"4 seasons, i changed the hole locations for the first 3 years, then they hired a high school kid who played golf and then he changed the holes, and i mowed greens in the morning. i never watched or played much golf in my life, so i would always just look for a level spot to put the hole. my boss did the holes for tournaments though."

176162339,"I realised the AP’s were making me a fat zombie, and I was researching what to do and found this forum. I stayed for a while, dropped off the radar for a couple of years, and then came back when things deteriorated to get support. Now I stay to support others, now that I am doing better. It’s a journey. We need everyone to chip in (Which I think they do already), and that’s what makes this great! I don’t really know anyone else IRL other than my family and it’s connections with the outside world. Kinda feels good to know there are others out there. Just wish the best for everyone on their way to getting better and learn more from each other"

However, evolutionary biology and sociology (_PERSON_ explicitly characterises morality as a social fact, and heavily entwined with religion at that) allow for a “collective moral” emerging from society yet not drawn from any a priori moral truths -although obviously societies will make frequent appeals to these a prioris to justify their moral claims."

176162377,I was always sad at snack because the coffee was decaf. I felt it was a tease. Also I was never hungry for snack because I ate the 3 meals they gave us and I don’t usually eat 3 meals a day. I loved that about the hospital. I would love to get into the habit of eating 3 times a day. I gives me so much energy to eat like that. But I guess I’m too lazy.

174383622,"I take it but haven’t noticed anything. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Metformin reverses the schizophrenia-like behaviors induced by MK-801 in rats. X _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Brain research , May 2019 20 Schizophrenia is known to be a complex and disabling psychiatric disorder. Dopamine receptor antagonists have a significant therapeutic effect in improving the positive symptoms that are associated with the illness. Therefore, dopamine receptor antagonists are commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia; however, they do not achieve satisfactory results in improving negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. Metformin, widely known as an antidiabetic drug, has been found to enhance spatial memory formation and improve anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. Metformin's neuroprotective effect has been well documented in several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, strokes, Huntington's disease, and seizures. In the 
present study, we used a rat model to explore the effect of metformin on schizophrenia-like behaviors induced by MK-801 (dizocilpine), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. We found that the pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) deficit caused by MK-801 could be alleviated by metformin. The hyperlocomotion in the open field test induced by chronic treatment of MK-801 was reversed by administration of metformin. Metformin has no effect on the baseline level of anxiety in normal naive rats, while metformin could relieve the anxiety-like behaviors in MK-801-treatment rats, though this effect is not reaching a significant level. Additionally, metformin could significantly ameliorate working memory impairments induced by MK-801. Moreover, the increased level of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3? in the frontal cortex induced by MK-801 was normalized by metformin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that metformin improved schizophrenia-like symptoms in rats, and is therefore a potential agent for the treatment 
of schizophrenia."

Sometimes, it feels like people are watching or listening because they say things that make me wonder “How could they know that unless they were watching?” My answer, “People just think a lot of similar things.” You’ll be alright if you accept that it doesn’t really matter if “they” are watching, what matters is how can I live and be comfortable. When I felt watch, I told myself it didn’t matter and that I would be myself no matter what. Eventually, I grew comfortable with who I was and it didn’t matter anymore.

I was filled with anxiety when I was triggered to use from a text from a phone that wasnt blocked. The only cure for the anxiety in my mind when I was triggered was to use more drugs, and feel better. Why do I think this way when _PERSON_ triggered, because the dr
ugs never make me feel better. Im fooling myself. So I do think I need something for depression or to help with my impulse or what is driving me to use the stimulant type drugs and not able to say no.

Its a nasty taste and feeling and it made me think I almost died or gave myself cancer and I feel horrible. I thought my painting changed because I noticed something I hadnt before, so my perceptions have been altered. I feel like the angels who were protecting me all left, like I destroyed them.

My psychiatrist said its a side effect of Abilify that occurs in some ppl. I had issues with gambling, hypersexuality/promiscuity, compulsive shopping, weed addiction and binge eating. The weed addiction brought more psychosis. All these stopped when I switched to Latuda but I stopped being social and now suffers from negative symptoms.

If you try using the Avmacol product that is mentioned - please let us know here and post your results. This study used a [Sulforaphane] preparation made at Johns Hopkins by Dr. _PERSON_, and is not commercially available. We have to be judicious about recommending supplements we have not tested in human subjects. There are dozens of different strains of broccoli seeds and some make only trace amounts of sulforaphane. Of the many companies working on this, we don’t know much about what is really in their products. Prostaphane and Avmacol are products that we have some first hand experience with. There will be an initial trial of Avamacol in schizophrenia being reported in late 2019 or 2020. Other trials are also ongoing. Also cooked broccoli drastically reduces Sulforaphane levels.

174383659,"I’ve gotten this twice. Once from a psych ward doc who was actually really helpful in that he noticed I was experiencing a manic episode, but decided I was bipolar without taking my history of several pure psychotic breaks at all. That was when my diagnosis was changed to schizoaffective bipolar type. The second time was when I was legally required to meet with a child psychiatrist (I was 16 at the time) before getting ECT. He said the same thing, but I was like… Well… I’m on medication… When I’m off medication I start rambling and eventually become catatonic… How eloquent is a catatonic person? And how many schizophrenics do you usually see outside your medical school textbooks, Mr. amphetamine pusher? (I know for a fact he pretty much only treats ADHD and is a dick from other people who had him). But at least 7 other doctors all declared I was either schizophrenic or SZA so I’m inclined to stick with that label. Diagnoses are ???????? I think… So how about you? Are you eloquent 
or suffer with more cognitively impairment?"

176162542,"“Because the two disorders are different in so many ways, it is likely that the basis for their social impairments differs as well,” he said. “Understanding these differences will be key for developing effective treatments. What works well for individuals with ASD might be very different than those with schizophrenia.” In previous research, _PERSON_ and his colleagues used eye-tracking technology and found that neither adults with ASD nor adults with schizophrenia look at social information in the same way as those without either disorder. His colleagues also found that parts of the brain that process social information are underactive in those with ASD and schizophrenia. But the researchers have also found differences. Individuals with ASD do not spontaneously orient to emotional information, while individuals with schizophrenia do. While both groups show aspects of paranoia in social situations, _PERSON_ and his colleagues are discovering that the root cause of the paranoia is different f
or each disorder. “People with schizophrenia have a much higher likelihood than the general population to attribute ill will to others, and this is likely tied to their delusions,” he said. “On the other hand, people with autism are more ‘socially cynical.’ They seem to be exhibiting fairly realistic responses to people as a result of the challenges they’ve faced in life because of their condition.” ScienceDaily Study compares traits of autism, schizophrenia A professor is studying the differences between the social impairments found in autism and schizophrenia to help develop better treatments for people with both disorders.

Just listen. Dont argue with them. In fact, dont do anything but just listen. They will try to make you afraid even more. As you start feeling afraid, just be aware of the fear. When you face the fear, you will become a little stronger. Fear is a state of mind. Fear cannot hurt you. Dont try to escape from the fear when you feel it. Learn to experience it instead of avoid it. Once you become more familiar with your fear state, it becomes more like knowledge than something to become afraid of. I used to think mine was the devil talking. Once I learned to face the fear it gave me, it started changing in form. Now, its more like that old drinking buddy who still an alcoholic and you’re now a teetotaler. From time to time, he comes to ????? at me and whine, threaten, insult(whatever a drunk person does).

I choose not to look at everything at once and just worry about a few things. I just keep plodding along and doing what’s necessary. I can put some things off and do other things. Maybe you can to.

176162635,I’ve been pacing in circles for a year now. The artane they gave me is 20MG which is high. It worked at first but it stops and I’m on propranolol and have tried cogentin. I have a kitten now from my mom and I don’t want to get rid of her but she walks under my feet a lot. I have accidentally stepped on her 4 times. I would hate to hear i should get rid of her because she had kept me feeling like I had something to live for. Anyone on a higher dose of artane or take something else for akathisia because accepting this side effect for the rest of my life shouldn’t be the only way to deal with things

176162642,"It’s especially hard when you’re dealing with so much. I’m tend to want to escape when there’s a lot going on in my life. But because sleep and being in bed has never been much comfort to me, I don’t have that much trouble getting out of bed, even if it’s just to get dressed and transfer to the couch for the day. I think, though, that I’ve always thought of getting up in the morning as bare minimum. If I don’t do anything else all day, I have to get up and get dressed. It’s one of my rules. I hope you have other ways and places to find peace."
176162643,I don’t think it’s anything serious
176162644,I think that’s fantastic. You get exercise and nature and out of the house all at the same time. Perfect.
176162645,That’s interesting. Specializing in schizophrenia only would be more in depth studies on how the brain functions with or without medication. Possibly active or inactive regions of the cerebral lobes etc… I would assume the DSM-V would not apply to these researchers since they would be concentrating on schizophrenia only and not all mental illnesses.

I don’t have hallucinations or hear voices I have personality disorder including paranoid personality and don’t see a reason for me being on antipsychotic and so far Dr agrees.

176162651,Lots but I don’t know how many
176162652,"Doubt it. Not according to current trends. Im solely talking about the first movie. The rest sucked. When I first saw it, I thought it was just an action movie. All the philosophy went right over me. Now. Its a classic and will and is being talked about. I haven’t seen _NAME_ show in a long time. Barely remember it. That type of human experiment on that large of scale is stupid, noticeable, and probably impossible. Maybe with mind control using AI to control sentience and consciousness, sure. Im thinking westworld. Westworld is amazing and deeper and better than the matrix in some ways. But matrix will always be a classic.

176162657,I’ve had weight gain. But it’s generally said to be quite weight neutral.
176162658,"That’s true, I can see your point. There is something comforting about being around others who are like me. I have also had urges to go to the hospital, but they’re usually quickly replaced with fear and talking myself out of it. When I’m at my worst and NEED to go, though, I never want to go and always convince myself I can get through it on my own (which is ridiculous. There have been many times when I should have just gone and gotten help because it would have saved me a ton of suffering)."
176162659,what makes you strongest is finding/knowing your own love for life. and not letting them take it from you
176162660,"Mental illness runs in my family. I have many ill relatives. I also suffered from trauma while growing up. I was physically beaten until I was black and blue. My father has explosive anger and could not control his temper. He beat my brother and me mercilessly with bloody rage in his eyes. I was taken out of high school because my parents could not explain my black and blue bruises everywhere. While I was growing up, nobody heard of DCFS. I am ok now but attract abusers and users all of the time. I also became mentally ill in my late twenties. I don’t blame anybody for becoming mentally ill. But, I do believe that my genetic risk and trauma led to my mental illness. I was angry for a while about it. Now, I am resigned. I have concluded to do the best with what I have. Anger about fate leads nowhere. I am happy with my life now. I turned out ok given the bad past I experienced. I am grateful for my life. I have no complaints. I thank God for my blessings."

176162674,"AS FOR ME! I don’t look perfect myself , one thing I did which helped me immensely with that cycle was removing the mirror. I removed the one in my bedroom and covered the bathroom mirror with a towel… Now, rather than panicking, feeling bad, stepping on the scale…I just do my exercise at my own pace… …,Nothing for a week, a little something here and there…etc…no regimentation, not too much…just learning new stuff… The end goal being brain health, relaxation, and functional strength/movement. Hormone release (hgh/testosterone), through damaging the muscle fiber, breaking myself down so my body mobilizes reactions to build me back up stronger… I never exercise to feel bad, rather I remain comfortably challenged…after finding and calculating that zone, I don’t exhausted sore or injured anymore…I just sort of show up and do my thing…then I read a lot and watch youtube tutorials on all kinds of topics…even between sets… Outside of a bout of exercise, according to how I f
eel, I remain sitting or laying down. Even just sleeping. More important than exercise, for physical health and longevity, is diet. Though, I think the two are both majorly important. As far as looking nice, I think diet is key. ———————————— Today my machine started squeaking, because I was doing a quicker setting on it and being bouncy. I was also running pretty flat. _PERSON_ seems to remove a lot of stress from the machine, and my bodyweight isn’t pounding the belt. It is a cheap treadmill, bought in maybe 2009, so it’s unlikely to last incredibly long. So…I want to treat it nicely this early in the winter. My mom bought me a gym membership, but I find it hard to go in there frequently…though there are some great machines in there. They have very nice treadmills, ellipticals, cycling, rowing, etc. I like treadmill and row. I get paranoid with people…It’s me, I work on and accept it… The winter is cold; so outside isn’t an option. Though at points it has been, seeing 
that I invested in new compression shorts and a quality pair of pants. As far as not freezing, it’s weirdly easy for me to run on humid days in the winter, with proper wicking clothing, etc, as long as I keep moving between repetitions… High humidity, low wind, means I don’t feel as cold. Getting my feet wet is the dealbreaker. …(jog very fast (on a stretch of clear dry pavement free of snow and ice)…then recover …the recovery is a matter of maintaining the heart rate, I’ll jog back the length by effort by feel… …as long as my feet remain moving briskly, usually carrying my bodyweight in a particular direction (not jumping rope)… …i find that it is usually too easy, as when the system is pulling some energy out and im generating heat inside my jacket, i sweat and stay warm, but not particularly hot…as long as i don’t stop abruptly and let my body temperature plummet… …i think acclimating to warm and cold weather is generally something which happens in the human body from season t
o season, as we’re so plastic… So I vacuumed my machine today, and squirted some bicycle lube on the metal parts. image 3024×4032 2.74 MB I’m not sure if the belt needs lubed…but online they seem to say they do. And for this treadmill they want some specific silicone lube which I don’t have. …Anyway, from now I’ll just try to treat it nice, meaning no more flat pounding, at high speeds, and maybe just a little, even 2.5% to lessen ground impact…"
176162675,"[I could not _USER_ID_ my previous post] On the ground in the place of encounter there were rock and rope - these two words have the same number of letters and the same first two letters. There were also corpses of _NAME_ in which one item was found - shampoo. That item gave me quite large amounts of coincidences later. 18.10.2018 I typed English transliteration of Russian name of certain creature from the game with Big Hole and in third link in results in Google I saw Polish word for shampoo. The same day I found word “shampoo” in article entitled “Engrish” (word is very similar to “English”, and English word for shampoo was present in it). I nicknamed shampoo “V” in certain other forum. 19.10.2018 and 22.10.2018 two large coincidences with shampoo appeared. In the same large shop I thought about shampoo or encounter “Big Hole” and some moment later I heard advertisements of two shampoos, it occurred twice. Certain day (maybe in XI 2018) I checked comments in certain dictionary 
and the most recent comment was about word which has the same first two letters as Polish word for shampoo and the same fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh letters as third, fourth, fifth, sixth letter in Polish word for shampoo. About 10 positions below the comment about that word the comment to entry entitled V (capital, just as in the nickname of shampoo) was present! Certain day after 22.10.2018 I typed English transliteration of Russian name of the same creature mentioned above (again?) and in third link or its description there were two words “shampun” (English transliteration of Russian word for shampoo) and one word “shampoo”! There were not so much results, but name of shampoo was present again! There were another coincidences with Big Hole. 4.5.2019 about 5 p.m. I wanted to check if black cat is on the item found on “Dear _NAME_” special encounter in the game with Big Hole. I saw fragment of the film from the same YouTube channel (and on the same playlist) as in 14.10.2018 and noticed that the 
image of black cat was present in singular item found in remains of Sergeant _PERSON_ (which were the only body remains in that encounter, just like corpses of _NAME_ were only dead body in Big Hole encounter; in both corpses only one item was found). The film had phrase “legendary legend” in its title. Some moments later I typed phrase chicken-kicken in Google and in results there was a link entitled “Legend of Big _NAME_”, it was seen directly after starting the searching. Black cat gave me many coincidences, it was one of them. _NAME_ and Sergeant _PERSON_ - both phrases have the same number of letters in last words, in these words first and third letters are the same! Only one corpses, only one items, similarities in the names, appearance in special encounters being small locations - pretty remarkable coincidences! Two words “legend” can be separated from the phrase “legendary legend”, in “Legend of Big _NAME_” the word “legend” appears. “Dear _NAME_” and Big _NAME_ - last word 
is the same! Big _NAME_ and Big Hole - first words the same, second have the same number of letters and the same second letters! It is not the end of Big Hole coincidences. In V 2019 I found screenshot from another special encounter from the same game - Giant Egg. On left down part of the screen there was such a text: You see: Egg. This heavy egg stuck in the hole and now will not move anywhere. You see: Hole. Obviously, a hole dug by animals. Hardly you will fit inside. What words appear after “You see:”? “Egg” (firstly) and “Hole” (secondly). What nouns are repeating in the text? “Egg” and “hole”. Between two sentences “You see:”, words: “egg” and “hole” appears and the word “egg” appears before the world “hole”. Word “egg” has the same number of letters as the word “big” and word “hole” is… the same as word “hole”. So we have next large coincidences with Big Hole. I saw also a game very similar to Russian one. English names of two first locations (c
losest to the place of start of the game) were two-word. First words have three letters and consonants at the beginning and vovels after them (as second letters), just as the word “Big”. Coincidence with word “hole” is even bigger: in the name of the one of the locations second word is “Hole” and in the name of second four-letter word which has “H” at the beginning, “o” as second letter and “e” as fourth is present! Amazing!"

The first three were torture and that wasn’t really the place for me. I was put in against my will. The military just threw me in there. Once for a month and I needed to be working a mission I had planned that went on without me. It was horrible. I felt like I failed my whole country. Suicidal the whole time. The 4th time when I quit my meds though it was where I needed to be. I was out of it. Don’t remember most of it. But I won’t quit my meds again. That scared the hell out of me and I haven’t been back since. That was in 2012.

She pointed that out and told me to exercise more to stop the progression. Backwards to 3 days earlier, my mom told me that I am not “ready to accept God’s plan and I just want to do whatever I want”. The thing is, I accepted this illness; what does she want? Here she is, trying to tell me to work harder and exercise harder to stop the progression, while I just understood my condition as it is and just continue to work out. What? Anyway, I’m exhausted. I feel bad about bothering members here now… I know that my body is getting weaker or at least that’s what I think. I’m so weak and I just don’t know if my body will support me. I don’t know…"

I think they’re scared and concerned for me. We’re a community. They love me. I have so many thoughts and beliefs it’s weird like I’m an alien or some ????. Maybe not physically, but cognitively like a God. Not the true God, but a god like an Anunnaki. It’s funny because my worst fear is I created the world’s first digital currency (bitcoin) in another dimension or reality and I hate it. I know what happened to me in 2011, 2012, and 2013. But everyone acts like it never happened. It hurts so much and so bad. Was I turned into an alien consciousness traveling the cosmos in an avatar body living in the cosmos, a product of the singularity and immortality? I don’t know. These things cross my mind too. Even other things. The future. Simulation theory. Time travel. Other planets and dimensions. The Illuminati. AI. Alie
ns. Cloning. Etc. I regret it. I felt like I was _NAME_ too. Nothing seems real anymore. Am I even human? It’s sad because I had no knowledge and I keep 'resurrecting"" past 2011-2013 and spawning backwards in time in a cosmic reset. I have memories of being from 2036 and beyond. Am I mentally ill? Is this website legit or is it a fake? This isn’t even base reality anymore. It’s not the same life. I’m just a lonely, disabled, horny guy. I love my country. I don’t even know what’s real anymore. I feel like a fake sometimes now. Maybe it was someone else, but I do really think it could be me. I experience consciousness transfer and am like this in every life. It just repeats itself.

176162739,I’m sorry to hear that. Can you do something nice for yourself? Like take a warm bath or eat food you like?
176162740,Sedation and increased thirst/urination. The former is because of risperdal and the latter because of lithium
176162741,Do you have a contract with your landlord? Does it offer some protection?
176162742,My Mom died from advanced dementia. Dementia is usually more debilitating than having a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia or schizoaffective. At least hers was. With schizophrenia ones condition can improve over time but with dementia things get worse over time. There is no improving. Dementia is a degenerative disease unlike schizophrenia.

176162749,Being back at this house reminds me of times when I wasn’t doing so well. I’m remembering the times when I couldn’t get out of bed. I would spend months in bed. Sometimes going 10 days without a bath. My husband was so gravely concerned about me that he had the people from mental health come here to get me out of bed. I remember they forced me out of bed and made me hold my pet lizard thinking somehow that would snap me out of it. Nothing seemed real. Nothing seemed good. Nothing seemed manageable. God I hope I never get that sick again.
176162750,"their just jaded, at least thats what ive learned from my classmates"
174383706,"I had dissociation as part of my psychosis. The world looked and felt surreal, the world distorted and things looked really vibrant or really dull and dim. I would see colors and patterns moving on the walls, afterimages of things that shouldn’t have had afterimages, or of things that I hadn’t seen. In the dark, I saw shadows encroaching into my field of vision. I confused things that were present in my thoughts with things that were outside my head, images and such, and most of all, I had thoughts that would be in my head talking that didn’t feel like my own, telling me things. The combination of all of these symptoms, combined with obsessiveness, anxiety, and more vivid auditory and visual hallucinations, resulted in some really disordered and delusional thinking that landed me with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. I’m telling you all of this because of this troubling sentence right here: It’s very possible that your symptoms are the result of anxiety and that there’s nothing 
else going on. HOWEVER, there’s also the chance that this is the beginning of some sort of psychotic disorder, in which case it won’t just “blow over.” The best thing you can do for yourself is to seek help now while you still have insight, some inkling that something’s not quite right. I wish you well."
176162751,"I went through this same phase in middle school, although it’s changed a bit. Instead of just bruising and bloodying my knuckles, now I fracture the metacarpal of my right pinky from punching concrete walls (or a refrigerator - my latest victim). It helps me tremendously to be on a medication that is known for having good properties against aggression, such as Haldol and Thorazine (both of which I can attest to). See if there’s room for a med adjustment and get started with a therapist if not already. I’m learning CBT myself right now to control my anger and learn coping skills. It works. I have a long history of violence to unravel, but if I keep at it, I see myself getting better. Good luck!"

176162759,"Consider testing thyroid level too as thyroid hormones are also used for creating dopamine. Thyroxine get converted to tyrosine. I have low thyroid and uses levothyroxine pill daily to stabilize thyroid hormone levels. A very low TSH value is preferred ideally less than 1.0. I found zinc also increases rage. It helps in converting thyroid hormone to active thyroid hormone T3. So I think the rage is basically from better thyroid function. The best part unlike stimulant based dopamine drugs is that tyrosine, zinc etc not causes insomnia."

176162780,"The most important aspect of mental disease is the individual’s ability to believe. In normal person they not quickly believe. So when a mental disease having individual gets a thought, idea or hear some message they quickly start to accept it and believe as if true. The degree of acceptance determines whether it will be a simple anxiety, intrusive thought, paranoia, delusion and even psychosis (full). So what can such individual do? They need to check or analyze with practical life to see whether such is true or not as mind believes quickly if not do this step manually. Also some times mind refuses to let go even.if its false at that situation the individual need to do forced ignoring. I think you got the answer for your question."

You can be left feeling zombified by higher doses that are necessary when you’re suffering from profound positive symptoms, but over time your treatment team will fine-tune a dose that works for you without disabling you.

I have a day job that is very demanding cognitively and I am able to handle it just fine (I’m an insurance broker).

I have to remind myself that I can’t predict the future (despite my illness telling me otherwise). I can only enjoy the time I have with those I care for, and will try until I die to keep trying to make new connections with people. As for the pain, it sucks. Pure and simple it sucks. Pills help, although results vary. Part of me wants to feel this pain is worth it, that something good can come from people, that my suffering with this disease could somehow impact another’s life positively. It’s given me compassion and humility, both of which you need to help others"

I use a nutrition tracker to ensure I stay between 1200-1400 calories a day. I’ve lost nine pounds in nine weeks. I’m pretty happy with my progress so far. Once I start working, I will raise my upper calorie limit to 1550. For now though, I’m far too sedentary, so I limit myself to 1400. Calorie counting is tedious, but it shows that you don’t have to automatically gain weight on certain APs."

176162820,well you go to a testing place and then they do intake test and decide if you have to get tested further. Then after the intake you take like an IQ test and lots of other tests and then after that you get a report and explanation on what they found out.

How to keep on living and trying and not to end up in a care home after my mother passess away? I sleep 14 hours a day and I feel already tired after I get up. O can barely work part time. I dont have even one real friend to meet daily or to talk. I lost my energy to play video games or read books. All the girls i try to talk somehow gets info that i have been in a psychiatric ward and they stop responding. Even walking 200 metres look difficult to me. I used to be a great bodybuilder and now im just fat. I dont get any disability benefits so I have to live off 200£ a month. I am afraid becoming homeless or being evicted to care home. I lost my ability to daydream of bright future or even feel inspired. What I do is eat, smoke, sleep. Sometimes I wish I would have died during one of my psychotic episodes…"

176162871,"I want to try to get a part time job. One of the biggest obstacles is going to be explaining my large gaps between jobs. I’m guessing it’ll probably come up during some interviews. These gaps extend over multiple years (up to almost 4 years). Also, all of my employment stints have been pretty short. I worry that the gaps along with not being able to keep working a job for very long are going to be detrimental to my ability to get a new one. How confidential are interviews considered? I am wondering if trying to explain my mental health situation is even an option at this point. Would it be smarter to try and be less specific? Maybe just say I’ve been taking free courses online/helping around the neighborhood and waiting for the right opportunity to present itself? I am going to discuss this with my therapist as well.

176162879,"I wish I never stopped meds for 2yrs, it was stupid as it damages the brain and now I have worse negative and cognitive symptoms. All internet sources say relapsing make all symptoms worse, positive, negative and cognitive. Also that it makes recovery and functioning much worse. My 2nd psychosis, by stopping meds, was much worse than the first one. It also made me violent while in psychosis, I was never violent during my first psychosis even off meds. Now I take stronger meds and higher dose to be stable. “Relapses, like the first episode, disrupt life and can be demoralizing. The experience of a hospital stay, having to take time off school or work, and the stress that a relapse places on families and other relationships can lead to disappointment and fear for the future. More relapses are associated with poorer long-term outcomes, especially when the relapses are more severe and longer-lasting. The psychotic symptoms become harder to treat over time and the person becomes less able to achieve d
evelopmental goals and function reasonably well.” https://www._USER_ID_.bc.ca/visions/blips-and-dips-vol15/when-psychosis-comes-back"

176162881,"I seem to have a different shrink everytime my review is due. But i preferred my old female psychiatrist - not because of her gender, she just was the most talkative. The last male one just stared at me for 10 minutes, making me uncomfortable and made me paranoid that i was lying about my illness. I spoke easier too with a trans female - cos she made me feel comfortable when discussing relationships and my sexuality. Everyone of them on the whole has been ok tho."
176162882,"Ok, no religious talk guys. You know better."
176162883,"It depends on the type of medicine and the dosage. The only AP that ever made me feel like I had a “chemical lobotomy” was Seroquel. My current AP, Zyprexa, doesn’t make me feel that way. I’m on a pretty small dose, 7.5mg, so that’s a big factor. It’s definitely not dangerous like an actual lobotomy though. Those were terrible times when people would perform transorbital lobotomies, just awful. Those operations went out of fashion with the advent of Thorazine IIRC."
176162884,I used to think my blood was talking to me !!
176162885,100 mg is not a good starting dose. Please don’t mess around with your meds. Definitely talk with your doctor about proper dosing. Lamictal is a tricky drug that needs slow and steady titration or you risk getting a potentially lethal rash.

I don’t follow all of the Christian doctrine, and I am philosophically skeptical about the existence of hell. Surely no God who was truly benevolent would send people there. I’ve come across people who professed themselves to be atheists who were still fearful of going to hell. They know it is not real, but on an emotional level its presence scares them. Fearing hell is something that is shared by many people. Try not to think about it."

176162905,"My husband had to have FMLA required to help me for work. My pdoc filled out that there are some weeks where up to 3-4 days a week every week for the year he has to care for me. So if he PTO or sick time, he gets paid, if not, they’re excused but unpaid. His chain of command and select coworkers know exactly why, the rest of the coworkers think it’s my physical health. He’s had that in place everywhere he’s worked for the federal requirement of 1 year. So both the jail and then DOC here. If you don’t have FMLA protection, and you meet it, it’s a way to take a health day without it counting against you when it comes to attendance and reviews. Etc."

174383756,Early intervention leads to better outcomes. You’ll soon find out if it’s a good choice or not. Abilify can cause some early side effects but if it’s helping your probably on the right track. It can take up to 6 weeks for best function so it’s a long term thing. Not sure of your story.

176162912,"Actually the greatest enemy of you is you itself. You allowed negative thoughts to run in your mind nobody else. You are not valuing yourself because of reasons like depression, psychosis etc. Consider a turtle it can’t run fast like a rabbit but is it value itself less due to that. You allowed other people to value you less. You are comparing yourself with others in society and making you less important. If you change your thinking your whole world can change. It doesn’t mean you need to first get rid of psychosis, depression etc to do that actually you are setting that criterion and making you disabled. If you look at different people in society you can see people who have various kind of chronic disease, poor people, disabled people etc yet in spite of their illness they living happy and its all because of the positive thinking mindset which all can develop if try."

For a while, I have been in discernment to enter a Catholic monastery of monks and nuns in my city, after college. The abbot said my mental illness would not be a problem, because I explained how I manage it. Pretty radical lifestyle choice, I know, but I’ve actually been thinking about this for years. I’m attending university in a couple weeks (!), and I have two books being published in November. I will be majoring in Piano/organ performance and English literature.

176162927,Pronoia? Huh. Well that’s interesting. I’ve actually had this quite a bit. I never knew there was a name for it. I thought it was just my outlook but now I see it. Oh wow. Paradigm shift.
176162928,"Meds helped reduce my anger issues. Without meds I threw knives at my brothers. Never done that on meds since my diagnosis in 2011 except when I smoked weed. Weed made me psychotic eventhough I was on meds, it broke the meds."
176162929,Sleep is so important. I have to take 50mg of Nozinan to get to sleep. Let your doctors know and they may be able to prescribe you something. Sleep is usually one of the first things that leads down a bad path

I would definitely definitely definitely give the interview a shot if I were you from what you’ve said. And it’s true, you can keep this job into old age since it’s not physically demanding. Sounds perfect!! Best of wishes with the interview if you decide to go ahead with it _AT_MENTION_"
176162932,Then i think it is for you to decide. I would look for a different pdoc for a second opinion though first. Even just to discuss the situation once or twice to ask for advice. I did that when i disagreed.
176162933,"No one can really prove for sure what happens to a person after they die. Any theory about what happens after you die will be rebuked by some other group, somewhere. So if you’re feeling suicidal then reach out to someone in this life. There’s no guarantees about what happens after death, by anyone. But you know you are alive in this life. This you know."

When I close my eyes at night right away I get pics in my head, images of shapes, two heads talking, a snake, piled up blocks… Also get sometimes when I close my eyes duri g the day. Random stuff.

176162941,I have been losing weight by increasing the amount of time between meals. Seems to be working - my jeans were falling down today
176162942,I stopped listening to metal and rock many years ago. Now I start listening to metal again. I was into classical music. I gave away all my CDs and LPs

176162949,"bike and hike, lift weights, jog, used to play basketball but not anymore, im afraid of injury, and have no one to play with. it doesn’t seem worth it, to drive 15 miles to the rec center for pickup basketball either."
176162950,"It depends on the definition of normal. I live with my parents and can’t live alone. My parents house and feed me, they also bring my meds. I stay in bed all day everyday, only get up to eat. In bed I am either sleeping or on this forum. At least I am not trying to kill ppl and myself while on meds so meds definitively improved my life quality but not by much."
176162951,"Reminds me of something I’ve been focusing on lately, “The Work” of _NAME_. Its a mental health helper created by _NAME_, look it up on Wikipedia, if you haven’t heard of it."
176162952,"My new “lead practitioner” is ex-military and im still getting used to her direct approach to me. Maybe i need that - cos i am prone to be manipulative to hurry things along like med prescriptions. Unfortunatley - if you dont kick up a fuss now and again - you tend to get left in my opinion. I told her the other day - just cos im not moaning at you every day on the phone, does not mean im not suffering. I do my best - then only ring when im sick of dealing with the voices, or the paranoia sets in. I have a fear of being labelled an attention seeker."

174383766,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Early- Versus Adult-Onset Schizophrenia as a Predictor of Response to Neuroscience-Informed Cognitive Training. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, IS _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of clinical psychiatry, Mar 2020 03 Developmental stages characterized by greater neural plasticity might be critical periods during which the effects of cognitive training (CT) could theoretically be maximized. However, experiencing a first episode of schizophrenia during childhood or adolescence (ie, early-onset schizophrenia [EOS]) may reduce the brain's ability to benefit from CT. This study examined the effects of EOS versus onset at > 18 years of age (ie, adult-onset schizophrenia [AOS]) as a predictor of response to CT and the relationship between duration of illness and cognitive improvements.This study is a secondary analysis of data from 2 randomized trials that examined the cognitive effects of neuroscience-informed auditory training (AT) exercises in 84 ou
tpatients with schizophrenia (26 EOS, 58 AOS, recruited between 2004 and 2014).There was a significant effect of time in all cognitive domains (F > 10.22, P < .002). The effect of EOS was significant only for verbal learning and memory (F = 5.79, P = .018). AOS increased the mean change score by 5.70 points in this domain, whereas EOS showed no change (t = -2.280, P = .025). However, the difference between AOS and EOS was no longer statistically significant after control for multiple comparisons. Shorter duration of illness was associated with greater improvement in problem solving in the AOS group (r = -0.27, P = .040).Auditory training is effective in improving cognition in both EOS and AOS. Treatment effects in all cognitive domains were similar, with the exception of verbal learning and memory. This result requires replication. Cognitive training provided earlier in the course of the illness results in greater improvements in executive functions.ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT_PHONE_NO_, NCT00694889??

I believe I have a camera implanted in my face or on my head somewhere and that the world is watching me through the hidden cameras on an app. I believe someone in my family shared the link to the world. I believe the people behind the tv are watching me and broadcasting me live on every channel.

Don’t tell me that I need to trust people because I know that people will hate me. Don’t tell me that I’m loved because I’m certain the world hates me. Why should I even love myself when the world is full of hatred?

When I cancel an appointment, and the pdoc calls regardless after I have been categorically told by the secretary that the appointment has been cancelled and will be given to someone else, I lose my ????. Honestly, I am not proud of it, but I really should treat these people with more respect. The trouble is I have had a fractured relationship with mental health services I know they’re trying, underfunded and very busy, but I remember all the broken promises people make - and all the things that go wrong with my treatment. It makes me angry It got to a point where I told the pdoc on my last call to stop apologising for other clinicians misgivings as it was not his fault. Last review I questioned what the whole point of the review was. Problem I have is I need this people, and at the same time I don’t want to have to deal with them"

I don’t avoid people much but I don’t really look them in the eye either as it distracts my thoughts so I can’t say what I want to say. And if I’m agitated in my mind or hypomanic or hearing voices then others can see it if I make eye contact with them. If I’m calm and stable it’s a little bit easier to look them in the eye.

176163101,"ScienceDaily Hydromethylthionine could slow cognitive decline: Minimum dose Researchers have reported unexpected results of a pharmacokinetic analysis of the relationship between treatment dose, blood levels and pharmacological activity of the drug hydromethylthionine on the brain in over 1,000 patients with mild-to-moderate... This drug blocks abnormal aggregation of tau protein in the brain,2, 3 which is increasingly recognised as an important driver of clinical dementia. They did a trial with doses of 8 mg intended as the control group vs the treatment arms of 150-250mg. The reason they did the low dose at all was because the active drug turns your urine blue, so they tried to blind it by having everyone in the study have blue urine. Well, all the groups did similarly, and this was seen as a failure of the drug. Evaluate.com – 28 Jul 16 TauRx touts second chance to prove success Presentation of the first phase III study of TauRx Pharmaceuticals’ tau aggregation inhibitor LMTX at the Alzheime
r’s Association International Conference yesterday divided opinion among seasoned observers and key opinion leaders alike. These... But, they realized there was something going on there as people who were not taking other _PERSON_’s drugs had more significant improvements. The pharmacokinetic profile they found, typical of many drugs, now explains why the pharmacological effects of hydromethylthionine at the high doses tested in the trials were no better than those seen in patients with high blood levels at the 8 mg/day dose. The analysis also showed that whilst hydromethylthionine has a similar concentration-response profile in patients taking the drug as an add-on therapy to the routinely used symptomatic treatments in Alzheimer’s disease, the maximum effect in these patients was reduced by half. This finding supports the hypothesis that symptomatic drugs for this condition interfere with the disease-modifying treatment effects of hydromethylthionine. “In addition to the reduction in brain atrophy, 
we were surprised to see the large cognitive effects of treatment in the patient group with the higher blood levels of hydromethylthionine at the 8 mg daily dose,” he added. ""According to scores from the ADAS-cog scale, the effect was around 7.5 points, or three times that seen from current routine Alzheimer’s treatments, and would be equivalent to an 85% reduction in cognitive decline over 65 weeks."" The clinical benefit and reduction in brain atrophy greatly exceed those reported for other therapeutic routes."

You get dependent on it quickly requiring more and more dose to get same effect also if plan to reduce dose or stop you get worse positive symptoms than you are experiencing now. Since you have pretty good insight of your illness I think your positive symptoms is not much worse to try strong APs in the first place. Weaker ones is ideal to begin with, the reason is as I mentioned before you can’t go back to weaker ones later. More stronger the AP more severe the side effects. One of the noticeable side effect with stronger AP is worsening of negative symptoms and also Parkinson like symptoms. Its not easy to correct negative symptoms like positive ones so need to always think about the other side."

176163147,"This is my second month of 9.5 to 10.4 pH alkaline water. My anxiety levels plummet with 10.4 pH water, since my brain feels less inflamed. The super hydrating effects of the alkaline water reach the brain quickly, and my brain feels like it’s chilling in a cool tub, rather than feeling gross and inflamed. Like, this morning my brain felt pretty inflamed, but maybe 20 mins after my 2 cups of 10.4 pH water it’s chill city. My intrusive thoughts are like barely there. I sometimes have one or two when I consciously think about them, but if I’m even a little bit distracted, I go for long stretches without even being aware of any stress in the brain that would make such a thought come out. Before, I would be self-conscious of sniffing, imagining the worst possible thing before sniffing that I might thought-broadcast and imagine being made fun of for, but now I can sniff to my heart’s content with barely an iota of thought like that. Just comfortable. My headaches are gone . Bye, headache demon! 
Don’t let the door hit your arse on the way out! If I had one recommendation, I’d say work your way up quickly to 10.4 pH water, as it supercharges the recovery / antiinflammatory action. I don’t think you can get 10.4 pH water from stores though, the standard is 9.5 pH, which works , but not nearly as fast."

I was living this conspiracy for about five years and told no one about it, people would talk to me in my dreams about it and tell me not to tell anyone, only much later heard voices and saw things, but the first time I had fullblown psychosis went without meds for about 10 years"
176163180,"Well the voices want you to talk. That’s why they’re always saying provoking things. But liars don’t want you to talk, because they hate the truth. I really think it’s a conspiracy for certain people to obtain information. The voices."
176163181,"Ok. Thank you! It’s that they took note of my address/my name but they told me I was good to go. So I guess that’s not a criminal record, then."
176163182,oh no !! I am so sorry _AT_MENTION_ this is horrible !!
174383823,Did your positive symptoms improve?
176163183,I remember reading a book called Surviving Manic Depression by Dr _PERSON_
176163184,_AT_MENTION_ my story is that I was interested in a man who was married and sloppily sort of flirting with him on Facebook and his wife and her friend have voodoo Pinterest pages so I assumed they did practice but I was not taking my meds at the time so I don’t know what happened. I backed off that guy and the voices got better. That is my story but I don’t want to trigger you. It is probably all bs and coincidence
176163185,"So, does it bother you that you can’t know whether someone or something is coming or going?"

176163193,"Our school sport in germany was pretty bad. Most of the time they would play soccer and I was more into basketball. But they did space for other sports so we not always have been forced to do soccer. Other than that I did skateboarding for six or seven years with even years long breaks. And for sure one year of bodybuilding which made me kind of depressed, and that’s the reason I quit bodybuilding. I was just spending all my money on food and thinking all the time about to add up some weight on the exercise or do one rep more. I was even documenting my work out. I got thin lost some fat. But to do it for years just to see some result was really messing up my mind."
176163194,"Just to add — you have to be very careful coming off antipsychotic drugs. If you do decide to come off, you should have at least the support of your doctor, going off cold turkey is certainly not recommended. It probably makes more sense to stay on a maintenance dose."

176163213,My wife disturbs me in the morning as she gets ready for work. Then I spend the next few hours having crazy vivid dreams that are always unpleasant. I have a hard time thinking too - it’s like my brain is turned off and I’m just operating. I try to take my meds within 5 minutes of waking up. Nothing like a neuroleptic first thing in the morning to get a schizophrenic going.

176163216,"People today are just generally not understanding of anything because they lack the ability to feel and sense and listen to anyone intimately (intimacy is not sexual - look up the definition) and so, they use their egos to judge everything without really ‘getting’ what anyone actually needs emotionally. We’re in the emotional dark age, to be sure, and it is no joke. If people didn’t operate solely from a place of ego then they would be able to feel what it is you’re going through without judging you… This place in general is highly judgmental and most are operating from a space of ego. You’re ‘seeking attention’ isn’t wrong, but it just isn’t getting what it is you feel you’re needing. I’m not going to say what it is you’re needing, I think it’s best for you to get into that space for yourself and see where it’s coming from. Most of us are in pain (emotional pain) and we tend to ‘act out’ in accordance to it. But its the question of: can we resolve the issue, or 
does it have complete control over us?"

174383824,"Hey, i totally know what you’re going through/thinking. First, yes, antipsychotics chane the brain and produce more dopamine to try to cancel out the AP. But the AP still works, the increase in dopamine is accounted for when a pdoc is titrating you on yor meds. When you suddenly stop taking the AP, the dopamine has increased like i said and you may exprrience even more psychosis. This however is temporary. The brain is amazing, and will adjust over time so that your dopamine levels return to their norm before the AP. What you will find though is that after some time you will still experience psychosis, even when the brain goes back to normal. Please stay on your meds. And remember to do research from every angle not just one that reaffirms what your hoping to find (im super guilty of this, not saying you are, just guessing). In my experience, i think accepting your diagnosis is very very important. It may be the most important thing to a true recovery. I have no advise for you to figure out if yo
u have schizophrenia, because its very personal, but i wish you luck. Parting words, 70% of schizophrenics dont believe they have a problem. (Sorry for the long post)"

ut other program as well sony vegas is not really for doing anime animation but just easily to use I myself now struggle with deadend wall as I trying to find other animation program that is not to heavy(photoshop is good but I can’t use it my pc is not good enough) umm so what should suggest I’m a noob If you mean start with drawing Anime(eastern/asia/japanese) style I honestly don’t remember how I start I just drawing with no clue(Me drawing: what am I doing? ) but I have this tip people at my art-club in my middle school use 1.find reference of what is you want to draw, if you want to draw anime like then search for anime 2.follow other artist that you like their style, you will get a lot of inspiration 3.save art you like and style you want to have, and look at it, memorize it(don’t repost other artist’s art) 4.many people start from trace from anime/mange they like or style they want 5.most of them pick some part they from style like and mix it together I still trying to make my own style Line 
Color Eyes Anatomy other things 6.Look at art a lot that what I do for my case I did a little too much(obsession) I don’t do much traditional art, I mainly doing digital art since I started, but more you good at traditional art more advantage you have So I can’t really suggest you about traditional art with digital art you can do with simple mouse and drawing program but if you have pen tablet everything is a lot easiler Hardware but I use pen tablet for pc I bought myself long time ago and I have only one(I don’t have saving money T^T) so I can’t tell which brand is better, but I use wacom bamboo, the price is reasonable(I have cheap one) for the use Software (aka drawing program) I use paint tool SAI for my style but if you into 3D or 2.5D painting I see a lot of people using photoshop(I don’t know how to use it lol) and many people use illustrator but I never tried it my english is not good so I hope I cover all thing I know honestly I don’t know if I can draw or all of art i draw just happened

The KOL considered Lumateperone to be so far the safest antipsychotic drug that he has seen so far when compared to the currently approved antipsychotic agents. He considered its slight somnolent property as good for dosing it at night (many schizophrenia patients have insomnia and sedative drugs like Seroquel are used commonly). He also pointed out certain issues in the failed second phase 3 study, for example, patients who did not tolerate risperidone due to side effects may have dropped out and not included in the analysis. He also agreed with higher than expected placebo effect in the study. He was convinced about the antipsychotic 
efficacy of lumateperone based on the maintenance of schizophrenia symptoms control when patients were switched from the standard of care antipsychotic agents. He also was excited about the lower side effect profile of lumateperone (since it is the only antipsychotic agent with D2 presynaptic partial agonist and postsynaptic antagonist properties). He also expressed excitement about the effects of Lumateperone in improving depressive symptoms (by serotonin reuptake inhibition), and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (due to only 40% postsynaptic dopamine blockade and pro-glutamatergic action) which could be another differentiator. He was not very optimistic about cariprazine (the only drug approved to treat negative symptoms of schizophrenia) due to its side effects like extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia."

176163292,Is that an angry “funny guy”?
176163293,Without meds I am repulsive to women too. I think the stress of psychosis stops and repulse our sexual needs towards people. I thought all women were trying to give me HIV. I got tested for HIV and it was negative.
176163294,Your weight is nobody’s business. There are plenty of big people without as good of an excuse. When I was on different meds and had been dieting for long periods of time my home health nurse was very critical. I wanted to tell her just what I thought. She was no skinny mini herself and likely no excuse. But you can’t.
176163295,Best of luck with everything!

174383843,"I have Paranoid Schizophrenia, and also ASD 1. Was wondering if anyone else has these dual diagnoses, or knows anyone who has both, and what can I do to try and be more normal? I am very lonely, and I had hoped psychology sessions would result in me being more social. That door has shut in my face now. I have this ASD 1 diagnosis which is new now as I was diagnosed as an adult, and there has been no real guidance on what next. It irritates me now, because I am aware of the complex difficulties in certain social situations due to autism, and I try to compensate but it’s hard work. Before I never really noticed these problems, but now I know the signs and issues, looking back at my life I feel full of anger that this was not picked up given that I have been in services since I was 16 I tried wrong planet website, but I cannot get on with the forum software"

174383846,Doesnt seem sufficient to be psychosis imo but I relate to everything you’re saying and I have schizoaffective. When I’m in a mixed episode (right now) my moods change daily and I could one day think I’m God and immortal and next day think I’m dead or have cycling thoughts of suicide. Stuff like that.
176163303,Hi _NAME_. I’m excited to hopefully get a job within the next two months. I am searching for one. Can’t wait to be not glued to the forum all day lol! Not that I hate this place but I just need a life. What do you look forward to these days?
174383839,Hahajaha 7u7u7u7u Yea it seems dumb

176163307,"That is a good point, the money goes to public schools."
176163308,I’ve also been losing weight. Eating more fresh produce instead of processed foods has helped with that. I didn’t really do much today. Just the usual chores. But today is my boyfriend’s birthday and now that he’s off work we’re both celebrating that he’s made it though another year.

176163313,"I’ve never had psychosis but before getting sick I was very good in school and videogames, I was able to study 12 hours a day. Also I had many friends online to play with and was very good in conversations."
176163314,"No i used to be lonely. Where i would spend my last few quid in a bar for the company. Now i couldnt give a toss. Im happy with my own company - and i havent got people trying to rinse me, and the bank balance is alot healthier. Associating with other alcoholics in a bar all day wasnt good for me anyway. I can go a week without seeing a soul."
176163315,"Probably you still have olanzapine inside your system. When it wears off, what will you do?"
176163316,I was stable for years too before stopping meds.

174383847,"I wish I could make it without meds. Some people here claim to but I don’t see how. I used to be a pilot so taking meds ended my career. I spent the first 5 years or so trying to come off of meds but my doctor wouldn’t take me off. I actually got down to only 20 mg of Geodon once a day. That’s the lowest dose you can take. He still wouldn’t let me quit so I quit. I made it 5 days and was in the hospital. Started hallucinating seeing and hearing things and I had never done that before. I got diagnosed with just delusions, paranoia and negative symptoms. But when I quit my meds I started hallucinating. The disease gets worse with time. Now I take 80 mg of Geodon twice a day, 40 mg of Latuda and 300 mg of Wellbutrin. I also take anxiety meds and sleeping pills. So 5 prescriptions now. The FAA wouldn’t let me fly for hire on any of them. I would like to quit them all. I envy you. But I wouldn’t be claiming to be schizophrenic. My stance would be I am cured and now I want to be an airline pi

176163323,"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for about a year now, but I am yet to be diagnosed. I still don’t have that clear definition of what my condition is at this point. Basically what I have been experiencing is people, particularly my mother, making me doubt my own memory and sense of self. Like they’d insist that I said things, or that particular things happened when I know for a fact that it wasn’t the case at all. Also how I am certain that it is gaslighting, is when I verify with other people (like my dad or brother, or _PERSON_) and they confirm what I know to be the truth. I feel that certain people who are close to me want to play on my issues of mental health to their advantage. They make me doubt myself and my own memory by saying things like “oh but you weren’t well, so you don’t know” or “you’re just confused, you’re not ok”.

My pdr is ok with me to try it. And yeah its like mania what I had on Abilify just like you: hypersexuality, addictions, compulsive behaviors.

174383856,"_PERSON_, I hope you still log on to this site, because your post is a beacon of hope for me. I’ve had this upper respiratory illness since 2013 that wasn’t healing until in 2016 when I went through a ingrown toenail surgery(alot of anti inflamation resources in my body were going there so I suspected that if I got rid of the ingrown toenail, I would start healing). Lo and behold, I was right, and tremendously. I started healing within a few days. When that happened, I had really hostile Schizophrenia develop immediately and it was very terrible. All kinds of crazy things happened including my computer getting hacked and google telling me to go to random places at 11pm(it was a monday, so nothing was open). I’m not sure how to to sum this up, but basically I took long *** drive and evertually got tired and some random guy at a gas station, who was just chilling there asked me if I needed some help. Honestly I was tired, so I decided to go to the hospital. When I told the staff my story, they 
just assumed I was psychotic(My computer really was acting up, but christ, whatever), and gave me risperdal. I remember feeling the worst I’ve ever felt in my life. As soon as my mouth touched those pills. I suddenly went into a severe bored depression and eventually started refusing the meds. The entire time I was on an risperdal(and this ended up being any antipsychotic), my healing would stop and I would also just feel like crap. I eventually got out of the hospital, and took a day recovering from psych meds. Then I started healing again. As time went by my SZ got alot better and my OCD, which started as soon as my illness started was tremendously better. I went from being extremely consious of the walls in my room so I wouldn’t touch them and be dirty to playing video games and moving around with ease, without the fear of getting anything dirty. It’s hard to explain, but my personal space feels way bigger. This has nothing to do with my OCD, but I feel sick in small rooms, so I’ve been spending ti
me in decent size apartments and hotel rooms. It seems crazy, but there are some really spacy apartments that are cheap. Anyway, the last time I was not on antipsychotics, I tried Wormwood and black walnut and my symptoms were getting better pretty fast. This was happening until one time I left my hotel to get something at the grocery store, nearly everybody was flicking me off. They also knew exactly when I would be somewhere. It was insane. My uber driver was acting suspicious as well and said that I couldn’t go back to where I came from. He wouldn’t stop looking at me during the entire ride and eventually I got phone out(only weapon I had) and threatened him ferociously until he dropped me off at the gas station. Then my uber app and phone service started malfunctioning with the gas station people somehow not knowing the password to their own wifi. Uh, what? I ended up staying there for an hour until someone called the cops. I talked to them for a good 15 minutes and then for some reason EMS was called
(the cop supervisor promised me that he would get me a ride home) and I was detained. Talk about the biggest setup ever. Any way, I’m out now and planning on suing of alot of people. Now, I’m wanting to try this wormwood again and I am glad that someone had the same results. It was just insane how fast things went downhill. I wasn’t feeling paranoid in my hotel room, and I never had a hallucination(even then, that is not commitable). Then as soon as I went outside, literally everyone I was looking at me. **** was insane."

174383870,"Idk but it will be in Phase 3 end of this year so in a couple of years. _AT_MENTION_ I don’t know if Abilify has an effect on Choline but I never read so and wikipedia doesn’t say that it has a cholinergic effect. It only affects dopamine and serotonin. _USER_ID_: Its has negligible effect, not important, but they don’t say if its stimulatory or inhibitory: it has negligible affinity for the [muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]. I have a major university degree in physiotherapy and took 4 psychology courses as electives in which I got 3 A’s and a B. My teacher asked me if I am interested in doing a degree in psychology because I was in the top 5 in some classes lol I love psychiatry but my SZ is handicapping me?"
176163355,"I became interested in behavioral science because I like psychology and biology and I looked up what the two combined is because I realized that you can combine two of your fields together. That was my lofty goal when I went to community college a few years ago. The teacher knew I was crazy when I said that’s what I wanted to be I think, among other reasons. Oh to not make the same mistakes twice. My grandiosity always prevented me from going back to school and doing well. Now I think I could handle it…once I turned 30 a lot of things seemed to change. When I was in school the first time I was too quiet. Then went back was too talkative for my own good. Now I have a better balance. One day I will go back I hope. And I will be as serious as anyone about graduating, succeeding, etc… When I went just to take a class for “personal enrichment”. I either got an A or an F. Because the teacher sees you don’t take it so seriously and they fail you, or like in my art class she gave me an A just b
ecause she liked me And I gave a great final presentation, neglecting most of the other work. Still got an A. Sorry if I HijackEd your thread a little I know you will do well"

I told my mom the other day (cause we were talking about the reliability of the Toyota Camry ) (We replaced it eventually with another one.) that’s how and why it came up; and I said: ‘I cant believe that happened’. And she said: ‘I can’t either’. The woman’s folks were in touch with mine every night…I was too frugal to have a smart phone as of yet which would’ve shown a light into my eyes and I thought it’d all be consensual if I passed tests of the woman in question. I ‘liked myself’ as I drove… (There’s that). And I had all the intentions in the world to fly as well, I wasn’t purposefully making it all the more dramatic. But I ‘capitulated’ one night, and got shot out of the cannon - after arguing with my folks about it! The senior moment here additionally was I forgot you could order plane tickets with just a debit card?? (So friggin stupid of me again in retros

176163396,"I think it varies per person and situation. I think medication is used way too easily in our societies to just numb people and prevent them from seeing, feeling and solving problems (i mean in general, not talking about sz). In the same way alcohol or drugs does. I personally try to not use meds that way, though sometimes i fail. I dont like to numb things i can deal with myself, even with effort. In cases of severe enough issues (florid psychosis, severe chronic depression, terror, etc) you can use all the coping strategies you want and still not be able to deal with it. Then medication can help to numb one enough to live a normal or more normal life. Not be a danger. Care for self and others. Etc. Seems like a good purpose. That’s how i see meds at least. What is “too much to deal with” varies per person."

It used to suck. It began when I was like 16 and ended at some point in my 30’s. I don’t know how. I used to take Effexor for it which helped but then I’d develop a tolerance to it and it would come back.

The company hires disabled people and veterans so they know my diagnosis so I don’t have to have extra stress trying to hide it. Good pay (considering what we do on a typical day, nothing too physical) The city I work in raised it’s minimum wage up to $15.65 and hour. I always feel guilty on paydays because it feels like they’re overpaying us. I work alone for the majority of the day. I get there in the morning and my boss gives me a task and then I’m off on my own most of the day. I mingle with office workers but no big social situations, it’s just telling jokes and making silly comments. When my supervisor is in a good mood she gives 
us extra 15 minute breaks. My co-workers piss me off sometimes but they’re OK people and I piss them off sometimes too. I get paid vacation and paid sick leave. We also get occasional mental health days as long as we don’t abuse the privilege. I get to eat lunch alone in my car when I feel like it. I’m on my feet all day but I prefer that to doing desk work.

174383909,1988-2017: In Essex. _PERSON_’s became an official diagnosis in UK in 1992 . Autism mentioned several times by me . Hardly any reaction by the mental health professionals . Oct 2018- First psych appointment in Wiltshire. I mentioned autism . My stepdaughter backed me up. Pdoc asked questions and at end said ASD and schizophrenia were the most likely diagnoses. 2 weeks later I got notification of an assessment date in February 2019 . May 2019 I was diagnosed with _PERSON_’s syndrome . On further reviewing my notes schizophrenia was changed to schizoaffective in October this year. In Essex dx had been paranoid pd . That very clearly shows how much dxes can change from one mental health trust to another in the UK .

174383903,"1. Introduction “Schizophrenia” has long been a controversial category, its boundaries uncertain, its essence ill-defined. This remains true more than a century after it was first conceived. Voices questioning its validity have been recently on the rise: some reject the category, claiming it conflates distinct illnesses and impedes research and treatment. Others, more cognizant of psychiatric history, are less sanguine about discarding it, but seek refinements. “Schizophrenia” is the worst of all diagnostic concepts, so it may seem—at least until one considers the alternatives (_PERSON_, 1963 p. 568). Prominent among recent attempts to define schizophrenia is the ipseity-disturbance or self-disorder hypothesis (Sass & Parnas, 2003; _PERSON_ 2010), a contemporary formulation of something long recognized: the presence of difficult-to-define yet distinctive alterations of consciousness or the sense of subjectivity. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _NAME_ were among those who emphasized a “radical q
ualitative change in the thought processes” that involved diminished first personal givenness and mineness of experience ( Meinhaftigkeit ) (_PERSON_, 1959, p. 100). This paper clarifies the contemporary self-disorder hypothesis and its current status, then focuses on lacunae in current understanding and on some recent and future research that might further its investigation. With all its flaws, the construct “schizophrenia” does seem to indicate some subtle but underlying factor at the core of a psychiatric condition that is perhaps best conceived as a syndrome (and probably represents a final common pathway with diverse etiological origins). But how best to characterize this condition, given its protean and ephemeral manifestations and varied definitions? _NAME_’s criterion of incomprehensibility and _PERSON_’s of recalcitrance to empathy (praecox-feeling) may best identify the prototypical instances of this strange Gestalt (_PERSON_, 2012). Both criteria seem largely intuitive, however, and neith
er offers an orienting theoretical account. The ipseity-disturbance hypothesis seeks an account flexible enough to encompass the diverse and varying symptoms yet specific enough to be clinically useful and relevant for research, neurocognitive and otherwise. 2. Self-Disorder Model: Current Status 2.1. Theory According to the contemporary self-disorder model (_PERSON_, 2003), the essential disturbance of schizophrenia is grounded in a two-faceted disturbance of core or minimal self, also known as ipseity, that is normally implicit in each act of awareness. Ipseity derives from ipse , Latin for “self” or “itself”; it refers to the most basic sense of selfhood or self-presence: a crucial sense of self-sameness, a fundamental (thus nearly indescribable) sense of existing as a vital and self-identical subject of experience or agent of action (Ricoeur, 1992; _PERSON_, 2005). This “central nucleus of the Self” (_NAME_ 1981), grounded in the lived body (_PERSON_, 2012) and implicit temporality (_PERSON_ 2
013), is experienced not as an entity in one’s field of awareness, but as the unseen point of origin for experience, thought, and action, as a medium of awareness, source of activity, or general directedness towards the world (_PERSON_ 1998). It grounds the first-person givenness or for-me-ness of subjective life. This experience of one’s own presence as a conscious, embodied subject is so fundamental that any description risks sounding empty or tautological; yet its absence can be acutely felt, as illuminated by a schizophrenia patient overwhelmed by “total emptiness… as if I ceased to exist” (_PERSON_, 2005). https://www.cairn.info/revue-recherches-en-psychanalyse-2013-2-page-119.htmUR#"

Sometimes you just have to accept that you can’t understand everything and that there is little rhyme nor reason to most things in life. Analysing and dissecting every conversation is going to cause you to be uncomfortable. Let go or get dragged along behind is wise advice.

176163633,Thanks to everyone for your replies. Its just frustrating to not see the scale go down and stay down and I know muscle weighs more than fat maybe that is the case with me I’m losing fat but gaining muscle. I will continue doing what I have bene doing going to the gym three days a week and I really need to stop snacking so much maybe that is my problem with putting on 3 to 4 pounds I do not want to gain anymore weight My Goal is to lose weight so I will have to cut back a lot on snacks lately I have bene eating a lot of snacks not anymore every now and then but not all the time but I guess it would be ok in moderation just like anything else.
176163634,As this years end draws near I am just so thankful for everything I have and everything that’s going on right now. I just got a package delivered from my son with Christmas gifts and I was going to treat my daughter to a night out at the Casino for her 21st birthday but she said she would rather have hot chocolate and go look at Christmas lights with her babies. I thought that was so cool. I got a little extra cash for Christmas. Things are going good. Everyone is healthy and happy and excited to be together and that’s really all that matters in the end.

I just can’t fall ill again and turn to these delusions again."

176163656,"I met my schizophrenic Uncle _PERSON_ twice in my life. The first time was before I was sick at a family dinner. Sadly I referred to my brother in his presence as crazy and although I started to approach him my nerve failed me. In fact as far as I know no one among us youth secured nephews actually talked to him. All I had heard was he heard voices and I had no idea I would ever be similarly affected. That day he appeared in a 1950’s suit, and spoke to no one. Years later I was sick but at the time the meds were helping more than they were hurting and I was eager to talk to Uncle _PERSON_ about what meds he was taking and how he was doing. When I confronted him he spoke but I couldn’t understand him. It was then I was told that he had 2 strokes and spoke with difficulty. Before the visit my Dad told me he was lying around in his apartment waiting to die but I didn’t understand it at the time. In the car ride to a cafeteria restaurant which he liked he spoke of a recent sexual achievement. I k
new from experience that he was likely lying about it and my Dad and other Uncles seemed to act the same as they played as though he weren’t a little sarcastically. We then ate (and I ate too much as the drugs would cause me to do for years to come.) I wished a picture were taken because my Dad and all his living brothers were there as my brothers would appear for me years after I got sick. When we went to his apartment I started playing with his guitar and one of my Uncles noticed I was beginning to play it well but I got nervous and put it down (Me and Uncle _PERSON_ are the only males in our family who technically had no musical talent possibly because we never really tried.) Uncle _PERSON_ died a few years later. My Dad watched “The Soloist” immediately after and asked me some questions about my illness. Later when lung cancer muddied up my Dad’s mind he would cry over his brother’s loss which he had forgotten happened as many times as someone would tell him he had died. Even as the storm passed 
it was not forgotten."

174383942,"comorbidity of schizophrenia and social phobia – impact on quality of life, hope, and personality traits: a cross sectional study Objective: The purpose of the study was to explore whether the comorbidity of social phobia affects symptoms severity, positive and negative symptoms, self-_USER_ID_, hope, and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in which all participants completed the Internalized _USER_ID_ of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale, Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (ADHS), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), Temperament and Character Inventory – Revised (TCI-R), and the demographic questionnaire. The disorder severity was assessed both by a psychiatrist (Clinical Global Impression Severity – the objective version [objCGI-S] scale) and by the 
patients (Clinical Global Impression Severity – the subjective version [subjCGI-S] scale). The patients were in a stabilized state that did not require changes in the treatment. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder was determined according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) research criteria. A structured interview by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to confirm the diagnosis.Results: The study included 61 patients of both genders. Clinically, the patients with comorbid social phobia had the earlier onset of the illness, more severe current psychopathology, more intense anxiety (general and social), and higher severity of depressive symptoms. The patients with comorbid social phobia showed the significantly lower quality of life compared to the patients without this comorbidity. The patients with comorbid social phobia also had a statis-tically lower mean level of hope and experienced a higher rate of the self-_
USER_ID_. They also exhibited higher average scores of personality trait harm avoidance (HA) and a lower score of personality trait self-directedness (SD).Conclusion: The study demonstrated differences in demographic factors, the severity of the disorder, self-_USER_ID_, hope, HA, and SD between patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with and without comorbid social phobia.Keywords: schizophrenia, social phobia, onset, hospitalizations, quality of life, self-_USER_ID_, hope, personality traits ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ndt-13-2073.pdf 640.29 KB"

176163766,I had some good conversations with my sister. I’m snuggling with my fiancée right now. I got to spend time with my 4 pets.
176163767,"I’m working on incorporating an hour long walk into my days. I’ve been working a lot and usually wake up around 2:00PM and out the house by 3:30PM and don’t get home until 12:00AM. Meditate for 30 mins, take my meds and do it all over again. I think you are right I have too much energy built up and need to tire myself out."
176163768,Thankyou I’m not sure if i would have been able to keep focus enough draw this pic had it not been for coca cola and two large coffees
176163769,Thank you dude! I appreciate you always having a listen!
176163770,Therapy didn’t work for me. It is just a bad fit for some people
176163771,"Thank you. It was ver nerve-wracking, but I just envisioned myself feeling proud and accomplished of sharing my story. And that helped calm my nerves. I also found out I’m not too bad giving speeches, so that’s a plus."
176163772,I wasn’t intentionally rude so much as I viewed everything as a high-stakes moral battle between good (whatever I thought at the time) and evil (any authority figure who disagreed). I did NOT know how to back down from a fight. I have been blessed with a child who is my clone lol.
176163773,My bp used to be bit high. It is still within normal range. I imagine it will raise a little again now.
176163774,I ate at McDonalds with a friend. I know its not healthy but didn’t eat too much.
174383974,"Hope its going well for you, i myself might be starting clozapine soon too."
176163775,"I don’t think most people have a “purpose in life”. Just try to do what makes you happy. Searching for some vague “purpose in life” will likely just make you unhappy, thinking you are unfulfilled. Hopefully some day you will find something you are good at and can excel. Maybe at that point you will consider that you’ve found your “purpose”. But I don’t think actively trying to find your purpose is necessarily going to make you happy."
176163776,"I have to wait until I feel it coming on. sometimes in the morning other times in the afternoon. it varies. just once a day. coffee used to get me moving, but it doesn’t do much to me anymore."
174383969,Doing well that’s the big question isn’t it. I can’t deny O is effective for me it’s just the side effects I could really do without. I’m sedated all day to the point of being a zombie. I’m sleeping my life away. _PERSON_ disappeared and lack of motivation even worse than it was before. The _NAME_ on top is the weight gain - I don’t fit my clothes anymore except for a pair of sweatpants that stretch. I’ve read that _NAME_ is more activating and fewer side effects and my pdoc seems open to a discussion about a meds change so thought I’d explore that path see if the grass is any greener…
176163777,"You’re feeling good better than yesterday You’re going to make this a good day You’re strong You can do it Your efforts are fruitful I love you, for the first time in a long while"
176163778,I keep myself clean and I’ve been working on dressing nicely but I kinda have a vacant expression a lot of the time and I tend to pace a lot. I’m pretty sure I do stand out to those who are paying enough attention.
174383975,"I wish I had more positive and less negative symptoms. Can I live in the hospital or a place for old and disabled ppl? Another option is living in the street but I don’t want to catch diseases like bacteria and viruses, I would rather suicide without suffering than living in the streets. I know I can’t survive in the streets because I am too weak mentally and physically."
176163779,My brother in law asked me if I was possessed. It really made me mad.
176163780,I might be coming off it too. I see my psychiatrist next week about a med switch cause I’ve had an allergic reaction and very high prolactin. I’m also very interested to know.
176163782,"I got insight this way. I forced myself to look out the wndow. I asked myself… why would anyone do this? I’m not wealthy, I’m not a celebrity, I’m not and never have been a government employee. What would they hope to gain? Nothing. I then took a prn AP and antianxiety prn, and write down my thoughts. I would read it, later. The next time I felt this way, I would repeat the exercise. Give it a try if your therapist or pdoc approve. It shortens the duration of symptoms, for me. Take care, hon."
174383981,"Pretty sure it’s something messed up in the motor function area of the brain. My face often mouths the words as the voices speak them, against my will, and I’m not sure how the two have become connected. Thankfully the mouth only moves with the voices, when the voices are silent I don’t have this problem."
176163783,i never was diagnosed with any childhood mental illnesses but i should and in the modern days of now i prob would have been diagnosed a lot sooner… but it’s no use looking at the past too much i think so i rather focus on the present days and the near future.
176163784,I’m sorry to hear that _AT_MENTION_
176163785,"Good wishes for you being sober. I used to be a binge drinker and got in so much trouble when I was. Having sex with strangers, waking up in strange places not knowing how to get home ,dancing on tables etc I have been sober for years and avoid nightclubs. I can’t seem to dance sober?I love n adore dancing though. I met friends when I drank alcohol and now I don’t have friends to hang out with. I have alcoholism in me and I can not drink “just one glass” so I don’t drink any alcohol at all. You save a lot of money and embarrassment etc"
176163786,"Just lie on your PIP form. You deserve it. I have no schizophrenic symptoms currently, but when I applied I mentioned 4 hospital visits, anxiety, intrusive thoughts, previous dissociation. Exaggerating a bit won’t hurt. Everyone who gets psychosis should be entitled to PIP."
176163787,"Some meds cause that, I got nice A cups"
176163788,Sorry to hear that. I hope you’ll be okay. Do you take a nap during the day?
176163789,"i am nothing without them, i am hooked with them, i cannot function without them, i hv to depend on them…"
176163790,"Not God, the devil and I created the universe."
176163791,"What an experience! Glad you came out of all of that ok. My first experience I wasn’t used to the meds, and I passed out, and they had to start an IV. Then I was hit on by a young guy, and the nurses had a fit over that. You didn’t say why your parents couldn’t handle you, that’s pretty tough. Thanks for sharing."
176163792,I’ve been having luck getting rid of constipation with large amounts of syrup and chunky peanut butter. I drink a lot of milk with it too. The only problem with it is that it makes me fat. I look like a pregnant ninety year old woman when I take off my shirt.
176163793,"From my episodes, I would say that yes there is something afterlife. However, I choose not to really think on it too much, as we have to live first. An afterlife would just be a bonus. It would be cruel to be a living thing and then that’s it. I don’t agree with any particular religion. I have my own views on this, but this is not the place to spread things that could make people more delusional than they already are."
176163794,I think that is what my pdoc meant with me _USER_ID_ - Not to focus so much on this illness.
176163795,They said if I will relapse they will diagnose me as sz I guess I will take the shot then… i dont want the label to harm my life
176163796,I’m a cold guy. I avoid the heat because it makes me uncomfortable. And cranky. Maybe it’s another fear to conquer. But how?
176163797,"This was a joke. My neigbor from england is really paranoid of hackers about hacking into his PC and other devices. Which sadly was funny as hell when he claimed that they hack into his ordinary photo-camera, so me and one another neighbor threw a joke about it. Don’t get paranoid of this."
176163798,Hope Faith n hope that things can get better.
176163799,The mind does not work like an on or off button. It takes repetitiveness for new patterns to be consolidated. It is called learning and memory I think It takes hard work sometimes especially for us because everything is ten times harder on meds and with trauma of psychosis

176163803,Addiction can also be psychological so it will not work for everyone for stopping smoking but its worth a try. It stopped me from vaping nicotine.

176163808,"They discussed whilst i was there - about going on the 3 month Trevicta jab, cos they are well aware how i dip in the last week - and end up getting in arguements lol. Not so sure tho - it gives me the opportunity to see them and talk when i have it, so ill probabaly stick to monthys and top up with pill form quetiapine."
176163809,Most antipsychotics have sideffect that last from a week to a month after the intial start

176163814,"I have this constant feeling that makes me feel like I am going to die soon. I just keep feeling so weak, lethargic, out of breath, and fatigued. I don’t know if this is fatigue or just anxiety. It’s been like this for months and now I don’t understanr why I feel this way."

176163818,"I wake up every morning at 3am, with adrenaline feeling like it’s burning through my limbs. I don’t know what’s going on. I’ve put it down to mental health, some kind of insomnia, but I just don’t know… it’s been almost 6 weeks. I discussed it with my gp, who thought it was mental _NAME_ related. I couldn’t take sleeping tablets because of my daughter possibly needing me. I have oxazepam but they don’t even take the edge off. Could this be a physical issue?"
176163819,I used to work in a nursing home too. The people there are so kind but are probably at the hardest part of their life. I miss flirting with the old ladies and all the different personalities
174383987,When I was unmedicated I believed in miracles but never when I am medicated and have no positive symptoms.

176163824,"Here is my trick. When the debt collector calls, say “I dispute the claim.” Then ask for the contact number of the source of the debt. Call that number immediately and say you have an old bill and can do a partial payment. Pay it that day to the company. When the debt collector calls and asks about the debt, the doctor’s office will have a record of you paying the bill. The debt will be filed as a mistake and be removed from your credit score."

176163828,"In 2004 I heard a voice say when was the last time you had a good conversation with your dad? The next year he died. I.ve also heard screams. Yet. The olanzapine is very good at blocking these. In 24 years i,'ve only had 2. Auditory. Hallucinations."

176163851,"I was forced on Invega last January in the state hospital. I took it in the pill form in the mornings, 3 mg for about 8 months . The severe fatigue in the evenings was unbearable. I was so tired I would go to bed at 8:00 pm and wake up at midnight and be awake all night. It literally made me feel a little numb all over. It didn’t help with agitation, it stopped my delusions but it made me feel strange and a bit ret**ded. I changed pdocs and I’m back on 1.25 mg zyprexa, I had been on Zyprexa for 20 years and I felt so good I didn’t think I needed it anymore, so I stopped taking the Zyprexa for 5 months last year. I realize now that I definitely need something and Zyprexa works the best. Nobody could ever tell me why they changed me to Invega, but it sure didn’t agree with me."
176163852,I think those are probably delusions.

174383994,"Oh, am sorry for this, lad… Yeah… but i was so scared from my jealousy before, that I couldn’t even talk, am still it tbh… Hardly to write this here even now, idk why … Oh, I have two friends left who want to see me, but sometimes its just me who avoids them. The socializing is still tiring me, it can be a pressure too… Yeah, maybe I wasn’t schizophrenic since kid, but depressive. I think there are rarely sz kids… I have a hard family history… I father who was beating my mom and my sister… Oh, I also see my mom every day in fact. It helps but she treats me as ill be forever alone and ill, that’s the story… You live with your parents? Maybe yours are cooler than mine . My mom say I am tough too per moments in fact, but idk, I think she doesn’t realize how much we suffer… What does your doc say about your mind racing, Lad?

176163867,"Hi guys, So I am new here and have been diagnosed since November 2015. I made a good recovery for 5 years. Recently, I relapsed and I am so disappointed, embarrassed, and saddened this happened. I am hopeful though that this was not a true relapse given that I had an operation in late November in which I lost my ovary. I was on a spinal epidural, General Anaesthetic and afterwards a morphine pump. The day following the operation I began to experience thought broadcasting again. It was like the sea rising above my head and I drowned. On top of this, presumably, my hormones were haywire as my body readjusted to losing my ovary and the morphine pump likely stimulated the dopamine in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways triggering the relapse coupled with enormous stress in my personal life, and the things I had been reading ie. conspiracies re: Hollywood, the entertainment and music industries leading to my belief in a vast Luciferian conspiracy. Anyway, has anyone had a similar experience, where 
they underwent an operation and shortly afterwards became symptomatic? I was unwell for a month before I was brought to Hospital and treated for one month, and for one month now I have been well. Is it a little too coincidental that the day after a significant operation I became symptomatic after five years of good health?Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
176163868,When my friends or family visit I feel tired after an hour or two and wish to be alone again. My husband i can spend a lot of time with comfortably but others I can’t. I need a lot of me time

Plan to substitute one day per week and peer coach 1 client starting August (if I don’t chicken out) On the way home I got the feeling like I used to get on the way home from school.

Also finding my needs valid and important. -Someone who is open minded and questions themselves if they had really done something that hurt me. That… comes along with admitting they have hurt me when it is the case. Someone who doesn’t relate all our struggles with MY mental illness and my Autism

However, some couple of months ago, most of this symptom disappeared. I tried a scopolamine patch and ipratropium nasal spray under the tongue. Alas, this did not help much, if at all. The most useful way to address the problem was to put a towel over the pillow. When one towel got uncomfortably wet, I switched to a dry one. -_NAME_."

176163901,"When I had my psychotic episode it was concurrent with the profound realization that I was gay and fancied my male friend. But at the same time, the psychotic part was that I found a giant female simulation inside me, that was fabulating, ventriloqusing, or having a sort of fantasy about myself. This nested realisation, that the female part of me was only a simulation, turned me off being gay. I went back to women and after a few more girlfriends, now 30 years later I am married these past 19 years, with two children and don’t feel the need to look back."

I’ve tried many other classes of medications too, including stimulants, opiates, and antiparkinsonian agents. Now, I’m on the tricyclic trimipramine, which has both antidepressant and antipsychotic effects; it is the best medication classified as an antidepressant that I’ve ever tried. Incidentally, I’ve noticed more antipsychotic-like action of trimipramine than clozapine! My best combination ever was buprenorphine (mild opiate) and methylphenidate (Concerta; aka Ritalin).

176163908,"I can ONLY speak to me experiences: I have children who are now teens. It is a lot of work. I could never work with this illness, - let alone with children AND work but that me, maybe not you but something to consider. I’m a really good.mom but my kids have seen me really struggle and be ill. They seen me unable to process or organize my thoughts and be in the hospital. For the most part it’s made them empathetic I think unless I’m wrong. They’ve seen me work hard to be well. One of my sons is in college to work in mental health or social services. He hasn’t decided. I have one older teen that does have mental illness similar to mine, which I’m sure is genetic, but he is an amazing person and he is a blessing to everyone around him and a really really cool and talented and musically gifted kid. He does struggle with working but keeps trying hard. Having a mental illness is a minor thing in reality to be an amazing human that gives back to others. I would never make a decision to not hav
e children based on a possibility of passing that down because my hubby and I know how to support him. And his life is as important as anyone elses. I have a supportive (not perfect) partner and that makes all the difference, for me. For me that’s pretty vital. Like others have said - my children and hubby motivate me more than anything. Everything in my life is forced with things similar to negatives, anxiety, paranoia but I look pretty normal compared when they get home compared to usual. When I know they are coming home I tidy up and plan dinner. I would never shower if it weren’t for my family, a real struggle for me. It’s challenging but apparently good for me. They add more structure to my life and I don’t have many feeling or passion left but I do for them. Once you have a family you’d do anything for them. I would not be as atrong perseverant or resourceful to be well without them. These sound selfish but is a reality but not a reason to have them of course. Lol. I’m glad we had them when 
younger but that’s just me. I have a friend who is severely disabled with MI and is an excellent mother. I have also heard of people with MI losing their children, very sad. I am not ‘recovered’ like you are so you have that going for you. I never have. I’m not sure I ever will recover from symptoms and current struggle, recovery for me is just going to be maximizing my potential activity level within my struggle.

174384035,"I didnt ask for the reasoning behind my med increase, but my pdoc just increased my antipsychotic from 10 mg to 15 mg to help with my anxiety. I take saphris."
174384036,Too bad we can’t quit schizophrenia like we quit smoking…
174384040,"I dont know. I dont like how it is in my country, because most care is very cold-hearted and there is a total reliance on meds and the “chemical imbalance theory” and no attention at all for the social, psychological, spiritual aspects of psychosis. Which really did not fit what i needed and wanted. I suspect in many thirld world countries it is the opposite and this too works well for some and not for others. But i dont know how it is there, really. Ideally doctors here would also learn from what they do well in the third world and the other way round. I have also read about sz people being tied to a tree in their own dirt all their lives in some places. In which case i gratefully prefer to stay where i am. (Btw: when i say spiritual aspects of psychosis i dont mean the “delusions are actually kundalini awakening to happily dive into” bullcrap, i mean that when you are in real fear of death for years, it is pretty normal to be overwhelmed, show weird responses and be confronted with all so
rts of existential questions.)"
174384042,"For how long were you off your meds for though… For me it was 7 months. And that was enough time to start feeling the negative symptoms to start to go down, but then psychosis struck and so I never had the time for the symptoms to die down completely…?"
174384045,"I went to see a pdoc today. Says it does not seem like schizophrenia or schizoaffective. When I asked if it is bipolar, he said he doesn’t want to give labels but he isn’t going to change current diagnosis on paper right now. Which is bipolar. He feels that my main symptom is anxiety and that if we can deal with that effectively then it might solve the mood symptoms too I am changing my meds too. No more Ability or Tegretol Hello Lemotrigine and Sertrine."

176164013,L dopa use gives initial highs then the effect is terrible low. Its given to parkinson patients. But all those who took it get worsening symptoms and they need more and more dose and then reach to a point where it stop working. Thus it actually progressed the parkinson faster than if they not took it. Have you tried L tyrosine? Its a safer alternative as L tyrosine is not a direct precursor of dopamine.

176164015,"I had religious delusions about Jesus and heaven on earth the first three years of my psychosis, Religion is in the past now for me and I don’t really have thoughts about it. I like the idea of jesus but don’t believe in him. But if I were to believe in god, I think of a god that has many creations, creation being only one thing he does, I also believe that once we live through his creation, We reunite with him and live in all of gods knowing."

176164021,Yeesh! Ok … I’m going to use that as a cautionary tale to keep in close contact with pdoc. Because it does seem to be working for me.
176164022,"Thats true. I not mean its better to die than living with sz. Its not just sz even in normal life too. Consider met with accident and unable to live like before. Another is old age people, they hardly able to function and still living. Sufferings is there and can come in different ways but need to accept and live with it rather than murder self."

176164025,What is the invega sustenna half life theory? I was on 234mg for one year. I’m hoping my pdoc will listen to me over my mother and put me on Aristada. I think it’s a better med for me. Right now I am getting negative symptoms really bad and I think invega is causing them. Maybe secondary negative symptoms I think. I feel terrible still lactating and others. Was wondering if I got 234 mg of invega a month how long will it take me to start getting better?
176164026,"Maybe it is just colder than usual out? What does your thermostat say in your house? Usually, when my temperature is lower, I feel warmer, because there is less difference between the outside air and my skin"
174384047,You have persecutory delusions which is a classic symptom of schizophrenia that I also have. You believe your mom is trying to kill you and poision you in your food. You have paranoia in which every thing your mom does is trying to harm you. These are all symptoms of schizophrenia. Bizzare delusions are just another kind of delusions.
176164027,"He hasn’t done anything wrong. I think you need to learn how male sexuality works. If we don’t masturbate, the sexual urges build up until we can’t resist them, and we end up involuntarily masturbating and climaxing while we sleep, with all the mess that involves. All boys learn to masturbate when they hit puberty, whether they’ve heard about it or not. It just happens. And expecting your boyfriend to keep his hands off his penis at all times is a completely unrealistic expectation, whether you’re always available for sex or not. Male masturbation is not the same as female masturbation. It just happens. The only way to control it is through extreme shame and sexual repression, or loss of sexual function. Not masturbating is for a healthy, sexually active male completely unnatural."
176164028,Looks really delicious!
176164029,"I finished my bachelor’s degree while having symptoms but was diagnosed until a few years later.

Applying for ssi in the mean time. I think it’s definitely for some of us to have easier jobs but that doesnt mean it’s good for us."
176164030,Oh I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ . Yeah have it checked out by a doctor. Hopefully it’s not going to be a serious issue.

174384048,"Newron announces initiation of new clinical trial with Evenamide in patients with schizophrenia, following approval of plan by FDA Milan, Italy and Morristown, NJ, USA, January 9, 2020 - Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A. (“Newron”) (SIX: NWRN, XETRA: NP5), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for patients with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system, announced today that it has reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the design and conduct of explanatory studies with Evenamide required to address previously announced potential safety issues raised by the FDA. Newron is developing Evenamide as the potential first add-on therapy for the treatment of patients with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In May 2019, the FDA requested that Newron complete additional short-term explanatory studies in rats and human subjects to address concerns on findings from a recently completed study of Evenamide in rats, as well as CNS even
ts observed following high dose administration of Evenamide in dogs. Newron met with the FDA on August 28, 2019, to discuss the issues, the proposed plans for these studies and the eventual start of the Phase III program with Evenamide. The FDA approved the plan proposed by Newron as well as the protocol for a first, four-week explanatory study in patients with schizophrenia, which is expected to start enrolling patients in the next few days. Newron expects initial results from the additional studies in rats and humans in Q3 2020. Subject to the successful completion of these studies, Newron intends to commence its proposed Phase III clinical trial program with Evenamide for patients with schizophrenia experiencing worsening of psychosis on atypical antipsychotics, and for treatment-resistant patients not responding to the antipsychotic drug clozapine. “We are pleased to announce not only the FDA’s concurrence with the plan for these additional short-term studies with Evenamide, but also their approval of 
the first clinical protocol that will start enrolment in the next few days,” said _PERSON_, Newron’s Chief Medical Officer. “The initiation of these studies in humans represents progress in addressing the issues raised by the FDA in May 2019. We expect to submit initial results to the FDA in Q3 2020, and the results from the next study in patients in Q4 2020. The acceptance of these results from studies in humans together with the results of the additional toxicology studies should allow us to start the Phase III clinical program in schizophrenia patients shortly thereafter.” About Evenamide Evenamide has the potential to be first add-on therapy for the treatment of patients with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Evenamide is an orally available New Chemical Entity that specifically targets voltage-gated sodium channels for the treatment of schizophrenia. The compound originates from Newron’s ion channel program and has a unique mechanism of action: glutamate modulation and voltage-gated sodium ch
annel blockade. Evenamide modulates sustained repetitive firing, without inducing impairment of normal neuronal excitability. It normalizes glutamate release induced by aberrant sodium channel activity. In a Phase IIa clinical study, Newron demonstrated Evenamide’s evidence of efficacy in significantly improving symptoms of psychosis compared with placebo when added to two of the most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotics in patients with chronic schizophrenia. The study also indicated that Evenamide is devoid of an effect on any of the over 130 neurotransmitters, enzymes, or transporters targeted by most antipsychotics. https://www.newron.com/ENG/Default.aspx?PAG=19&MOD=NWRPRS"

I know a person with bipolar and she was clearly manic but did not go to the hospital. She ended up getting psychosis from the mania and was sent to the actual intensive treatment facility. There, she got tardive dyskinesia from the anti-psychotics she was put on. Be honest with your psychiatrist, it will only do you good."

Not saying you don’t, I have no clue about that, but it will at least get that off your mind. I think you have mentioned before about having a dirty house so you would feel so much better in that aspect which could result in more positive outcomes! I know if I have a mess (which is only when my parents are out of town because both of my parents are neat freaks, which I appreciate) but it makes me stressed in general. I once had a boyfriend whose house was so gross I had to end it because it stressed me out! A clean house and a clean body does wonder for my mental and physical health!"

I told her that I had indeed visited with other people besides her and had visited with a total of seven residents so far. She told me that she hadn’t seen me in any other hallways and she doubted what I said. I told her that I had been in all the hallways. I then told her that I didn’t have to visit with her anymore if she didn’t want me to. She then got angry and told me that she didn’t say that and that she was going to complain about me. I told her that I didn’t mean to insult her and that that was not my intent. She told me that she didn’t care and she was still going to speak with my superior.

Most people on earth are stupid or fit between the bell curve. I fell on the right end. Unfortunately, I’m broke and don’t want to raise or have a kid that gets schizophrenia or grows up in poverty or raised in a broken, single family. I cannot even take care of myself. I’m a nearly lost cause imo. If things were different, I would adopt or have 8-10 kids with a beautiful blonde. I would have to be well-off though like making 500k+ a year to support those kids. There’s so much education and support now for autism/asperger’s syndrome. I was lonely and bullied which is the biggest side effect + raised with an ignorant, abusive father. It sort of helped. When I was out of line or acting like a ????? my dad would spank me or pull my ears. It got me to toll the line."

Her illness looks more like bipolar 2 but she has crossed over into moderate mania once but I digress her manic symptoms aren’t that severe and has never experienced psychosis.

174384066,i got lucky with my pdoc. Normally i had to go to different one but she stopped working in the hospital i was referred to and then ended up with my current pdoc who doesn’t work in the hospital anymore either but i moved along with him to his new practices. But he always been very good for me and helpful but i think you do have to get lucky with coming across a good pdoc.
176164090,Yeah hearing that but sometimes meds are the answer for multi episodic peeps. No escaping that. A good psydoc works with you to achieve best function. I know that is hard and the throw meds at everything approach really does suck but it seems your running out of plausible options. That is the thing. It goes pear shaped and you end up in a corner it’ll screw you more than getting on a maintainance dose of something that helps. That is just my opinion.

176164103,"And it’s basically too late for a lawsuit because my parents thought a lawsuit would “be too hard” on me and then they agreed with the psychiatrist after I told her I thought I had been raped at boarding school, then I found “Schizophrenia, undifferentiated” circled on a sheet of paper. Then my mom started protesting WHINSEC which is some type of government agency that practices illegal torture and spying on Americans, and train it in schools to go overseas and torture people in like GTMO and Latin American farmers. So she has been on the FBI radar since she protested the gov. and met my dad, whose father worked for the GOV. and was drafted to create nuclear weapons during the Cold war and was a nuclear physicist and astrophysicist and teacher. So my parents went to this protest at Dusquesne University in Pittsburgh PA and fell in love at some point, my mom was arrested and detained by the FBI when she was pregnant with me she has said, now she says she wasn’t pregnant when she spent th
e night in jail. The story changes to fit my dad’s memories. My mother was fighting with my dad over his involvement with government contractors and why does his business have to work with defense contractors. My dad is in the healthcare tech. sector. He writes software that streamlines healthcare and record keeping. It seems innocent. But I had an episode at seventeen when I believed that there would be a pandemic and that his company would profit off surveillance hospital software. Then my mom tried to divorce him and she went missing with some people and got arrested hours away from here like it was all a setup. Ever since my mom was arrested she’s been a “schizophrenic” but she wasn’t schizophrenic before she went to jail, although she did have some depression her episodes really kicked off after going to jail protesting WHINSEC. They tortured her in jail and they gave the women cancer treatments or something…"

Depression is not just sadness, but also lack of pleasure and motivation. It takes many forms from sleeping a lot to inability to sleep; eating alot to being anorexic, feeling nothing to feeling sad. Sometimes, the elderly are thought to have dementia when they really are depressed. Please ask your psychdoc about it."

Or more specifically: thoughts that others find delusional and I’m not sure about. But more meds will kill my liveliness, happiness, consciousness, love and make me sleep day and night. Yes - they only dampen and dull everything. That is their effect. As a result they also dampen and dull psychosis, so it feels less intense and I can resist acting on my uncommon thoughts. And thus avoid people locking me up and giving me more drugs, or me jumping in front of a train, or me sitting in a corner refusing to eat and drink.

But in my personal experience, I have noticed that it does affect me SOMETIMES but very rarely will I feel strange from taking it. I guess my question is… has anyone here taken this substance and felt generally normal? Especially after taking for prolonged periods of time, like a daily dose for instance? I should note in being treated for ADHD, which is normal in my family. My sister and uncle and aunt also take it for ADHD"

One office I went to was the third busiest in the entire COUNTRY. When I call the general number. It can last 2 hours on hold sometimes. I have both: the local and the national number. Local is best in most cases. I don’t even remember how to make an appointment. Not sure if I can make one anytime. Appointments are best because you skip the line outside and go right in. Next time, I will try to make an appointment. I haven’t seriously considered looking into work. I feel like it’s a scam sometimes. I’ve heard mixed things.

I did it without a lawyer though…I never had to go to court. Just took several times of applying. I did have to go in for a series of memory tests though. Since memory is one of the main debilitating symptoms associated with Schizophrenia. Tests took several hours.

176164195,"Meds help and therapy initially for me. Good diet and exercise and relaxation techniques as well as mild to moderate exercise. Not sure what else to say to OP. To me the real controllers are aliens and reptilians. That’s what _NAME_ calls them: Archons or what not. I’m a Christian so I keep it to demons, fallen angels, and Satan basically. It’s hard to focus and think sometimes. I get distracted. My brain is broken and damaged from mental illness. Sometimes, I sound like a hypocrite or weak-minded and fake, but I’m not. I’m just not devout or a zealot. I’ve always questioned things growing up and argued and fought. I feel like my spirit is damaged, weakened, and almost destroyed from mental illness, constant looping back and forward through time (non-linear sometimes), and horrible horrible contact with higher intelligent races. I’m chronically mentally ill with confusion and dissociation but have made dramatic strides and improvement over time. To sum it up, I feel like I’m trapped 
inside the Matrix or simulation. Even had dreams so real like this reality or worse where I was like _PERSON_ waking up in a vat in the machine world (real world at the power plant) a few times. Talk about freaking trauma, ptsd, and horror. Nobody was there to save me. No ship or anything. No people. It was slightly different too. There was a big red computer like in Westworld. I guess it’s a quantum AI type ????. The sentinels could read my mind holographic-ally and they were like fascists… You can’t really have freedom or safety unless you are one of them and they are demonic or evil. I guess I believe Satan is like a black widow in a large spider nest or web (always trying to find it’s next prey or victim) but cannot be everywhere at any time. It must take a finite path at a finite speed to entrap and kill its prey. My uncle taught me that. I feel like that about simulation theory. If there are infinite amount of planets, perhaps, then if it’s like the matrix, there are a whole bunch of artifical 
matrices or planets that are enslaving humans. I just hope there is just one planet Earth and we don’t live in a simulation and that the universe is just isomorphic or computer like in appearance and function but really not one at all. It’s real as heck. It’s hard to tell what’s real anymore. Maybe it’s isomorphic and simulation theory is a lie. Maybe I’m just so ?????? up and confused I cannot tell what’s real anymore. I might be lost lol. I think sometimes we live in the actual game “The Sims” with the same tech and motif and overall theme. That the controllers or would be players can get inside our heads, thoughts, and dictate and totally control our lives and reality. Time would be viewed differently to them similar to the three eyed aliens in “Slaughterhouse Five” novel or PKD’s world. Maybe 5 dimensional or higher beings…They would perceive the past, present, and future all at once and can interact at ease just like we walk forward, backwards through time. It’s going to take 
me another decade or more to process all this ???? and what I’ve experienced. Posts and conversations like this. People get tired of me talking and hearing about it. I really wish I could get a therapist and see her 3-5 times a week and do psychotherapy or psycho-analysis like _PERSON_. Unfortunately, it’s not too popular here and I’m limited to where I can go and travel. Insurance wouldn’t probably cover it either."

176164201,"That is a tricky one. On the one hand, it is very hard to conquer an addiction when you have someone constantly offering your vice. On the other hand, unless he is getting mad at you for refusing the junk food (which would be a whole other issue) the responsibility to say no is yours. He is going to continue craving high calorie foods because his body needs it to compensate for manual labor. If he ate the way you need to eat, he would become malnourished. You need to accept that the two of you have different food needs. If it is too hard to watch him eat the food you want while you stick to food you need, then maybe you guys should just start eating separately for a bit."

Then i thought his quote would come true…billions of people would be fed and everyone of them would become a Star because of it…everyone in the world would become famous like I felt i was…and then somehow i would fit in.

No need to commute to a gym. Listening to whatever I music I enjoy in a loud room setting. Cons are treadmills meant for the home aren’t as good in terms of features compared to those commercial treadmills at a gym. Treadmills are loud and take up living space. Unable to socialize with others at home and lastly, a treadmill is expensive. Currently with Coronavirus, all gyms are closed so getting to a gym serves no purpose."

Also, the med’s are so deadening that you don’t want to take them for that reason too. There was a time when the way I was behaving when I was off my med’s that I was lucky if I didn’t get badly hurt. If I was on my med’s, and I saw someone behaving the way I did when I was off my med’s, and he was getting badly beaten up, I probably would have just shrugged my shoulders and said, “He brought it on himself.”"

176164265,"For me I guess it was this specific delusional belief I developed that if I was left alone, the devil would kidnap me and take me to hell to be impregnated with the antichrist. Of course it’s impossible to never be alone, as much as I tried, so I ended up being alone a number of times. I realized I hadn’t been kidnapped despite this. I tried to be like well I’m on my period so he can’t kidnap me yet because he couldn’t get me pregnant right now. But my period ended and still no kidnapping…so I began to be like what if my friend was right and this is all a lie… So maybe what it takes is a very specific sort of delusion, one that the brain can’t find an explanation for why it’s happening and becomes skeptical of. Unfortunately that isn’t really something that can be provided by a therapist. Perhaps a seed of doubt has to be planted first?"
176164266,"There’s no reason to be insulting. If you can’t be respectful, leave the conversation. i don’t feel like babysitting this topic because of one person that insists on continuing to be disrespectful."
174384109,"Ok. So part of how I conquered my own delusions was first to no longer be afraid of them. To somehow find a reason to believe and be confident that I was strong enough. Not to need to be afraid at all. Like in meditation you learn to examine a thought as a thought, and then just let it be that and nothing more. It’s non-attachment. Buddhists practice it. It’s a way to overcome these things whether they are real or not. It took time, practice, a lot of focusing on releasing and learning to zone in on good feelings and who I want to be. Because schizophrenia is scary it takes everything. It takes so much strength to pull your true self out of the wreckage and confusion. I took the pieces and put them back together into something, I learned creative visualization. So maybe you could analyze your delusions as a sort of symbolic representation of something you need to learn. I have had schizophrenia for fifteen years. I have tried everything. I know how to fix it even when the medications aren’t a
s helpful. The first step is learning to embrace truth within. who do you believe you are, who do you want to be, write things down no one can steal your writings or words if you write them down. Maybe you have insight into something important. Maybe you could turn your fears into hope, into success. For one, I am opposed to the cameras like in Walmarts they don’t need to film people in their stores. You have some kind of insight into these issues. I have had delusions and I would convince myself of something impossible and obsess over it until it was tearing me apart. Just let it go and live your life and enjoy good things. Find something better to think about. Do something with whatever skills you have. I mean I don’t know if what I have done works for everyone. Sometimes it helps to find a higher power, to just pray for a miracle. Like my mom she doesn’t pray anymore because she’s afraid to believe in God. So we get stuck in this position of where we are split between science and spirituality, and 
there is no bridge between. In my opinion the connections and division between God and Science is at the base of what is needed to understand schizophrenia and cure cancer but the divide between God/Soul and Science/Physical is a problem that the 21st century will eventually figure out. I just stopped caring that people call me crazy anymore for my ideas. Those aren’t what made me sick. My ideas are what cured me."

176164271,"I’ve had it 40 years, since I was 19. In some ways it has gotten better, some ways worse. The symptoms are way less intense and intrusive in my life. The symptoms are way less disabling now than the first couple years I had it. I don’t even really have regular “episodes”; those stopped about 2009. Sometimes the symptoms get worse than usual but I no longer have parts of the day where I’m fighting to keep my sanity. I used to have those every day but now the symptoms are pretty much under control. Now for the bad news. I do isolate and have some difficulty socializing. But I still function enough to take care of myself and live independently and take care of my business and deal with people fairly well when I need to i.e. cashiers, bank tellers, case workers, family, DMV, etc. When it comes to people I find a little humor and a little friendliness goes a long way.

Now I am feeling much better mentally and I’m pursuing a diploma in paralegal studies.

174384133,"Glutamatergic hypo-function in the left superior and middle temporal gyri in early schizophrenia: a data-driven three-dimensional proton spectroscopic imaging study Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies have examined glutamatergic abnormalities in schizophrenia, mostly in single voxels. Though the critical brain nodes remain unknown, schizophrenia involves networks with broad abnormalities. Hence, glutamine plus glutamate (Glx) and other metabolites were examined with whole-brain 1H-MRS, in early schizophrenia. Three dimensional 1H-MRS was acquired in young schizophrenia subjects (N = 36, 19 antipsychotic-naïve and 17 antipsychotic-treated) and healthy controls (HC, N = 29). Glx (as well as N-acetylaspartate, choline, myo-inositol and creatine) group contrasts from all individual voxels that met spectral quality, were analyzed in common brain space, followed by cluster-corrected level alpha-value (CCLAV ? 0.05). Schizophrenia subjects had lower Glx in the left superior (STG) and 
middle temporal gyri (16 voxels, CCLAV = 0.04) and increased creatine in two clusters involving left temporal, parietal and occipital regions (32, and 18 voxels, CCLAV = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Antipsychotic-treated and naïve patients (vs HC) had similar Glx reductions (8/16 vs 10/16 voxels respectively, but CCLAV’s > 0.05). However, creatine was higher in antipsychotic-treated vs HC’s in a larger left hemisphere cluster (100 voxels, CCLAV = 0.01). Also in treated patients, choline was increased in left middle frontal gyrus (18 voxels, CCLAV = 0.04). Finally in antipsychotic-naive patients, NAA was reduced in right frontal gyri (19 voxels, CCLAV = 0.05) and myo-inositol was reduced in the left cerebellum (34 voxels, CCLAV = 0.02). We conclude that data-driven spectroscopic brain examination supports that reductions in Glx in the left STG may be critical to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Postmortem and neuromodulation schizophrenia studies focusing on left STG, may provide critical mechanisti
c and therapeutic advancements, respectively."

Facility is an “all comers” market for those who have no other options, but it costs five to fifteen times as much as a regular policy. I don’t think the current delivery model is financially sustainable."

176164455,"My theory - I devoloped this theory after reading Late. Prof. _NAME_’s book "" A Brief History Of Time "" Fundamental Theory Of Existence. https://fundamentaltheoryofexistence.blogspot.com/ http://gorijalasagar.blogspot.com/ When we divide a number other than zero with 1 we get the same number. Dividing with 1 means cutting the number into 1 part, it means the number remains as a single part, the number remains same. When we divide a number with 2 we mean to say that we are cutting the number into 2 parts and we get two halves of the original number. Dividing with zero/0 means we are cutting the number into zero parts or we can say that we are making that number into zero. It means the number has to become zero. It means the number will be equal to zero which is not possible. There is an exception and that number is zero itself. Zero can be divided by zero as we get the same equality. Zero is equal to zero and zero can be cut into zero parts, it means we have the same number without any inequalit
y. Zero can not divide any other number as inequality exists between other numbers and zero. Division with zero means converting numerator into zero parts. Zero divided by zero is zero as numerator can be converted to zero parts. To divide any number other than zero into zero parts is not possible. For example 1 can not be divided into zero parts. If 1 can be converted into zero parts then we get 1 is equal to zero which is not possible. If 1 can be divided into zero parts we get 1=0 and it means failure of balance, failure of all equations and also failure of all laws that govern existence. 1 is not equal to zero so 1 can not be destroyed into 0 parts and 1 can not be created from 0. It is clear that creation and destruction between 1 and 0 are impossible. 1 can not be created from 0 and 1 can not be destroyed into zero. Any number other than zero can not be divided by zero. Creation is impossible. Also destruction is impossible. As numerator other than zero can not be cut into zero parts, numerator can not 
be destroyed into zero parts. And, as numerator other than zero can not be divided into zero parts, inequal numbers can never become equal. If number other than zero can be cut into zero parts by zero then we get equality between inequal numbers. Because if numerator 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 can become zero after cuttting them with 0 then we get 1 = 2 = 3 = 4 = 0 which is impossible. So, creation is also impossible. As inequal numbers can never be equal creation and destruction are impossible. An artist can create and or destroy a piece of art and it is relative creation and relative destruction which are related to change of form. But, absolute creation and absolute destruction are impossible. Absolute creation means 1/2/3/4 apple(s) or 1/2/3/4 mango(s) or 1/2/3/4 lime(s) or 1/2/3/4 orange(s) or 1/2/3/4 kg gold can be created from zero and absolute destruction means something that exists can be converted into zero and we are not talking about change of form. We are talking about appearing from zero and disappearing 
into zero without change of form which is impossible. If creation + destruction are possible then we get 1 = 2 = 3 = 4 =0. It means 1 can become zero and zero can become 1 also 2 can become zero and zero can become 2 also 100 can become 2000 and 3000 can become million. Which is impossible. Therefore absolute creation and absolute destruction are impossible. Creation is impossible and it means that Universe can not be created and was never created. It means Universe has beginning for its existence. Also destruction is impossible and it means that Universe has no end. Universe has no beginning and also there is no end to the existence of the Universe. As creation is impossible, Universe can not increase in quantity and everything in the Universe is finite. So Universe is finite and anything that has physical existence can never increase beyond finite value. Therefore existence of anything physical can never become unlimited or infinite. Existence of anything physical can not be infinite. As creation and destru
ction are impossible and as Universe has no beginning and no end too, there is no room for Creator, it means that there is no God in the Universe. God(s) can not exist. Sir _NAME_ said that Space is absolute and the great _NAME_ said that space is relative. _NAME_ said that space can contract and expand under the influence of gravity. _NAME_ in his "" Theory of relativity said that velocity of light is constant "". And again _NAME_ came up with a new theory known as General theory of relativity. And, in General theory of relativity _NAME_ said that gravity bends space and light travelling in a bent space cases light not to escape black holes. He made two mistakes. His first mistake is to conclude that velocity of light is constant and then he explained his postulate with another theory and said that gravity bends space and this is his second mistake. In the beginning there was a train experiment concerning velocity of light. What is it? If I am standing on ground without moving and a passenger in train is mov
ing away from me travelling in train then he can look at me as if he is not moving and I am moving away from him. This is called relative movement. And if I am not standing still and if I am walking away from him then he will see me walking away with the speed of train plus with my speed of walking. But, Scientists observed that velocity of light on ground was found to be 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second) also if you are the passenger in the moving train and if I am carrying source of light and if you measure velocity of light coming from light source I am carrying then Scientists found out that the velocity of light was found to be same and it is 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second) on Earth. Then someone said that there is a substance in Universe called Ether and light travels relative to ether and that is why velocity of light was not found to be relative and it was found to be constant. Several years later two Scientists conducted an experiment and that experimen
t is known by their names and it is known as _PERSON_ experiment, after this experiment the two Scientists concluded that there is no such thing as ether. Why is velocity of light is found to be constant and what did the experiment reveal? In the train experiment you must notice that I was carrying light source or source of light and when light is generated from the source it was not being carried by me. Even if the source of light is being carried by a train, you must know that light generated is not being carried by the train and that is why velocity of light is not found to be alterted. This means concluding that this experiment has anything to do with velocity of light being constant or relative is invalid. In _PERSON_ experiment velocity of light was measured where they did not change gravity. Entire _PERSON_ experiment was conducted where the gravity is same. For physical objects that are not light or not other forms of electromagnetic radiation gravity is directly proportional to mass. It means 1 kg go
ld will have less gravitational pull than 2 kg gold. So for gold gravity is directly proportional to mass. But, light is a form of energy and light has both mass and energy. The famous equation E equals to mass times square of velocity of light ( E = m . C square ) says that Mass-energy equivalence states that mass is concentrated energy. The equation says that mass can be converted into energy. This equation is not only equation for Mass-energy equivalence, it also the equation of light. This equation which is also the equation of light says that light is a form of energy with mass and when we consider the relationship of light with gravity we must understand that light is a form of energy with mass. So light’s mass is inversely proportional to gravity as light has both energy and mass. Gold has mass and its mass is directly proportional to gravity and light has both energy and mass and light’s mass is inversely proportional to gravity. Therefore velocity of light is found to be 186,282 miles per second 
(299,792 kilometers per second) on Earth whereever the gravity value does not change. Velocity of gold was found to be relative even on Earth’s surface. But, velocity of light was found to be of same value on Earth’s surface as light is unlike gold and has inverse relation to mass-gravity. So, gold’s velocity is found to be relative even when there is no change in gravity. But, velocity of light is found to be relative when there is change in gravity. So velocity of light increases on moon than on earth as light’s velocity is inversely proportional to gravity. Moon has lesser gravity than Earth and that is why velocity of light will be more on Moon than on Earth. Therefore gravity bending space in not true and velocity of light is not constant. Space is absolute and velocity of light is relative. Gravity does not bend space. Gravity bends light. Also in computer screen we can have single dimension, two dimensions and three dimensions. In computers single dimension is line, two dimensional object is sq
uare and also in computers three dimensional object is cube. So, in virtual reality we can have single, double and triple dimensions. In physical world or universe the fundamental object like atom itself are three dimensional and in physical world less than 3 and more 3 dimensions are not possible. So, string theory which claims more than 3 physical dimensions is not correct in physical existence. Single dimension is associted to length, double dimension to area and triple dimension to volume. If string theory is correct and there are more than 3 space dimensions then we must have more than volume, which is clearly not observed to be true. Velocity of light is relative. Space is absolute. Space is three and three dimensional only. Also time is a representation of change and in a changing universe there is no going back or going forward as there are no unlimited universes with unlimited changes. Time travel is not only impossible but does not make any sense. There is only our world or universe and it is chanin
g and there is no going back in time and also no going forward in time. Existence is finite and time travel is meaningless. Time travel is impossible."

176164520,I am on Invega and after a year of being on it the loud voices stopped. Now if I am slightly nervous or even while walking I get a slight panic attack and hear the whisper of somebody calling my name. The panic attacks keep happening. It is like I can’t walk without headphones or I will hear voices because everytime my heart rate goes up a little I hear voices. I quit smoking which has helped a lot and the cigarettes made me hear the whispers all the time. I am desperately trying to find a medication that will allow me to wait for the bus or go to the grocery store again without hearing the whispering in the white noise of the environment I am in. Does anybody else have this problem or have figured out a medication that will make it go away? Thanks.
176164521,Yes I did but for me I cant quit meds as I can get violent.

176164529,They started teaching us in the 2000s in the military that if you have sex with an intoxicated woman it’s rape. I have picked up many women in bars as a young man. So did my friends. I argued with the lady who first told me this in a class once. She didn’t like it. I guess we were all serial rapists. And my wife is an alcoholic so she is always intoxicated. I don’t drink anymore and don’t go to bars so the intoxicated women of America are all safe from me now.

176164538,ilovethaifood. thanks so much for your reply and ideas and comforting thoughts in it. i am working as much as I can is pretty much on the mark of the real truth. I have a direct supervisor that thinks she was born to make my life a hell and she has succeeded so far at much of it. before the illness my mind was quite sharp. now it is not just foggy – it is downright dull. i am trying little by little to regain my cognitive skills. do you think there is hope for that? I kind of doubt it but it cannot hurt to try. and the same goes for all of us here. it cannot hurt to try to get where we want to be… hugs to you ilovethaifood and to all of us here. _NAME_
176164539,I have used L Theanine in the past but it doesn’t sedate my mind enough to get rid of the constant dreams. Even if I do sleep I’m dreaming lucidly. To the point of feeling like I’m not sleeping. I need a Xanax script or opiates to turn my head off but no sane doctor would write that…

176164544,"There is nothing wrong with feeling that you’re unique and individual. We are all our own people, with our own unique humours, jobs, ethics, morals, etc. However, when you say grandiose, it is almost suggesting that you feel superior to everyone else. Now i’m not saying that you shouldn’t be happy with yourself, especially seeing as you’ve had such a rough start to life. But i think you can still feel good about yourself as an individual and unique person, without the need of being grandiose. I hope that makes sense."
176164545,Sometimes there are just random voices that are people make comments then there are the voices that always stick around and never go away except to eat and have sex. But it appears that they voices are spirits looking at us from a higher place of existence. I dont know why they study us. Are we causing a disturbance in the field by existing within the universe. Or are we different because of the way our minds manipulate the universe. Different then the average person. The voices must want something…

176164559,I’ve gone through stages where I wanted to kill my family members. My psychiatrist has said that there is a big difference between thoughts and actually harming someone. Don’t feel like you are alone in this. I deal with it by going to my doctor and get medication changes. My hallucinations tell me to do it so once they go away I don’t have those thoughts. So I would recommend you see your doctor.
176164560,"Though I have a taste for chocolate, I’m a little bit of a wuss when it comes to the real thing, I can’t really get my tongue’s receptors around dark chocolate, grapfruits I love, so it’s not the bitterness, it’s much more complex than that, I don’t know how to describe it, and raw vegan chocolate almost made me vomit. As I said, I’m not really that experienced with modulating the taste buds on my tongue to accommodate it, did you mean coca or cocoa, I think both are in coke. Anyway, sugar is what I wanted to talk about, which is why I brought up my disability with real chocolate. Sugar, like crystal meth, is designed to teach the youth about the swings of growth and recession that the empire naturally goes through, via it’s highs and lows, acclimatising them to living within the confines of the walled city. I only ever take sugar with cocoa, not coffee, which I drink black, I try to drink diet coke or coke zero, usually opt for pepsi max because of the taste, but I have my doubts a

175140875,_AT_MENTION_ I would recommend contacting your pdoc and asking them if they are aware of recent studies on schizophrenia and covid-19. Then ask if schizophrenia would be covered under the “severe high-risk disability” portion of the guidelines. The guidelines mention that “clinical healthcare providers may use their clinical judgement” so it’s worth asking your pdoc.

In the short interactions with other people including health professionals it’s hard for anyone to see. The psychiatric lot know about my organising and planning difficulties because I told them . They may also know about my executive functioning difficulties in general , as this was really emphasised at my post diagnosis _PERSON_’s appt and may have been passed on to the pdoc etc .

all of this. And I just got out of the hospital this past Monday. I’m finally trying to focus on myself and only worrying about me. It’s so foreign but im doing better away from all the stress I was under, living with my family has helped me see a lot of things and destress. Idk what im asking for, I guess advice or kind words. I’m just trying my best to stay strong through this."
176164638,For threatening to kill my doctor. The police got involved with it… I regret doing it very much and wouldn’t do it ever again I’m currently in a psych ward involuntarily
176164639,"No one can help you if you don’t start by helping yourself and accepting reality, I see ppl denying their illness as slightly delusional as they don’t believe reality and live in their own world. In this world everyone knowledgeable told you you have psychosis, Drs, family, nurses, us, etc"
176164640,Yes the move. I feel sick
174384202,They’re always speculating the causes but if they knew they’d be able to prevent it.
176164641,No it’s not a fact. It’s a delusion.
176164642,Also my chest hurts should I worry?
176164643,"I’m actually losing weight really quickly. Eating a fair bit too. Down to like 205 lbs, from 215. I guess the lack of takeout is really making a difference."
174384209,"I have catotonia without antipsychotics, the only time I was able to read was when I was on Abilify. Now I can’t focus for more than 5 min."
176164644,"Really , that’s a popular word lol."
176164645,"Can you find something to do that will get your hope back? Maybe a volunteer job, maybe start exercising, maybe helping your family out in some way? Maybe get a few bucks and give it out to homeless people? If you can find some way to help another person it will make you feel good. I have hopeless times too. But I’m lucky because 90% of the time that I feel hopeless, I go to bed and I wake up and feel much better and hopeful. A good nights sleep works wonders. A long term solution to get hope would be joining some kind of day program that is not stressful or joining a support group."
176164646,since nearly all of them cant get me to feel permenantly good thats what made me disbelieve in all them i begin to believe only on my feelings and my knowledge take from them and see what suits me or what will not
176164647,Love does require honesty.
176164648,"Been alone for 4 years now, I wouldn’t mind a SO, but a body pillow is fine for now lol."

176164650,"I did 6 treatments. It didn’t help, it just needed with my memory."
176164651,"Hey, don’t worry about it, you don’t need to impress anyone. I mean that in a nice way. Just be you and you’ll be fine."
176164652,I once read that people with higher IQ’s tend to have fewer children. If that’s true _PERSON_’s theory is in file #13.
176164653,They keep proving it to me that they control my mind but when I ask them to prove it by slapping my self they cant so i think it’s all a lie
176164654,"Thats good, do you talk to psychiatrist and friends daily."
176164655,Do you think you’re so empathic that you suffer from it? Maybe it would be better to not give a f*** as much of?
176164656,At the end of the day it’s just a different classification for what’s basically the same thing .
176164657,How are you doing _AT_MENTION_? Are you taking the Zyprexa?
176164658,thats what they tell me that iam gonna pay for ever little thing when I die in pain and discomfort for ever even if I listen to them now cuz they say its too late
174384206,I have been on latuda for about four years and am stable and well. No positive symptoms at the moment. No depression either. I am not obese either. I think latuda is a very good medication. Hope it doesn’t stop working.
176164659,"Im not talking about Salad Fingers or any creepy things, but the idea that im able to broadcast messages to people from the comfort of my own home to people all over the world. I was sitting looking like a stoner and i was whoa, im using some rocks some inventor tricked into thinking and communicating with other rocks. Then i started thinking about how theres buncha radio waves being broadcast all over the place, how cities operate and so on. Just random thoughts that dont really connect."
176164660,"I agree, also to add, negative symptoms contribute to early death. They can cause obesity, heart disease, diabetes etc Severe negative symptoms prevent me from exercising, eating healthy, etc As a result of staying in bed most of the time due to no energy from severe negative symptoms I gained 160lb in a couple of years. I am obese now, was 135-140lb before sz, got up to 295lb after. I am taking meds for bp, cholesterol and Metformin for prediabetes. I would have developped diabetes if they didnt stop my Zyprexa."
176164661,Always chat to your doctor. Weed affects most psychotics negatively and alcohol can lead to dependence etc. Alcohol is also wasted calories and not so good for the old weight gain most suffer from.
176164662,"Just a cursory look online listed dizziness, crying, and sadness as possible withdrawal symptoms. If you’re doing it with your doc, tell them how you’re feeling without it. May I ask why you want to go off it?"
176164663,"Wish you luck, and looking forward to hear how it works."
176164664,I wonder if I’m afraid of myself.
176164665,risperdal 6 mg clonazepam 0.5 mg Zoloft 50 mg
174384214,I want to read that one…
176164666,Yes. I’ll take my pills in 20 min and then turn something on the TV and try to get some sleep. I can’t sleep in my bed because of my back.
176164667,I will give it another year before I consider medication again After I tried everything else first… I want to try to heal alternatively first I mean I’m already taking Benadryl to manage my dystonia It works but makes me very sleepy which sucks! I don’t like taking it… It’s okay for now But I’d rather not take Benadryl and find something else
176164668,It is feeling very restless and that you have to move.

174384212,"Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_! Are you feeling like the medication you are on is helping? Are there people in your life who can speak to that as well? These are the types of questions that are good for doctors. If you want a diagnosis, I believe there are agencies who do this, well at least in Canada. Not sure where you are though. Here you have to go to the Canadian Mental Health. They have a lot of resources including how to get a different doctor. My brain doesn’t have anything like that, completely normal. Had lots of brain scans when I was having seizures. I’m reluctant to believe that this is the sole cause of schizophrenia."
176164672,Yes call your pdoc. They may adjust your meds.
176164673,"Tulsi really is a miracle supplement. It reduces OCD, makes mind calm etc. Tulsi comes in tea form and in capsule too. Capsule contain bit more content thus useful for getting stronger effects. Organic India is the best brand to choose from. Their formulations and tea ranges are all based on Tulsi. Anyway its best to choose original Tulsi ingredient and not mixed version as they sell various mixed versions like Tulsi Green Tea, Tulsi Rose etc etc. For getting deep sleep Chamomile tea is best. Just like Tulsi its also caffeine free and need to drink it few hours before going to sleep. Works best for sleep. Avoid taking it during day time as Chamomile can give slight drowsiness."
176164674,"Well, it depends on whether you want your hair darker or lighter. I know you want red in it to make it auburn. Also, if you use natural hair tint it stains the hair and can’t be lifted out if you don’t like it and want to change it so there’s that to consider. You should probably get a level 5 auburn color and use that unless you want it lighter. What are you going for?"
176164675,I got 82. But I have diabetes and it didn’t ask about that. But I’m losing weight so maybe that won’t matter. Not sure.
176164676,"I don’t think it’s a matter of being negative, though. Failing is painful. But it is negative to dwell on it."
174384210,Yea but not all catatonia is caused by vitamin deficiency.

176164678,I hate injections though
176164679,"Since you said people are outside screaming this to you it definitely is a hallucination. Are you doing anything that interesting for everyone to be watching you for months? I know people would e bored watching me! If you really believe you’re family is telling you this you could set up a camera of your own and film it to watch later with someone you trust. Also have them show you these videos you’re supposedly on and send us the link so we can help you decide what to do about it. I say this because you need to put it behind you for your own piece of mind and share with your doctor so you can be put on the right meds. This is common sz and they are delusions. If you find out for 100% certainty that you’re family is saying this to be cruel, which is unlikely you have to do what’s right for you and your children’s safety by not being around people who jeopardize your mental health and any progress you may have made."

176164690,"I had someone I was madly obsessed with as a teenager and young adult. It took me ages to get over them (10 years or so) and sometimes I still dream of them. The best thing I did was confess to them that I had really strong feelings for her and asked if there was ever feelings reciprocated. Getting it out in the open and learning how things went from her point of view really helped me stop fixating on her and stick more to facts. I wouldn’t necessarily advise that you do the same as I cant gaurentee that you’ll get a satisfactory reaction. But I can sympathise at least. Try and remember that everyone deserves happiness, and if they are happy and you consider them a friend, you should be happy for them too."

174384222,"How do I communicate that Abilify is triggering me to relapse into addiction? It’s had this effect on me all my life. I noticed that every time I take it a few hours later I become impulsive, depersonalized and forget about caring to stay clean. I didn’t take it last night and I slept better. I don’t feel urges to use today but I’m anxious that if I have bipolar or schizophrenia I need some sort of pill to keep me normal. The Cocaine caused psychosis but it’s worn off and I can’t take Abilify because I’ll want to use it again. But the psychiatrist has been ignoring me for months. He calls for our appointments and says keep things the same. My mom was taken it haldol and put on Abilify and she’s gone psychotic again. We have the same psychiatrist my mom and I and he seems pretty unresponsive. I feel like it’s mal practice like it’s abusive. My moms upset about money etc too and my dad told her to stop giving me money it’s been stressful. I didn’t want to relapse but I know th
e trigger now. My best option is to secretly stop taking it so I don’t relapse and use drugs and because no one will listen to me and there is no open line of communication my dad never admits when he’s wrong about something I want to sue."

174384211,Me too If I reduced my meds to under minimum dose my positive symptoms worsened but also negatives worse. I’d be so dead I’d lie on floor and stare into space. Mood swings will be worse so I’d be agitated and hear more voices and be paranoid more - but also swing to severe depression / negative symptoms So my meds would help improve both positive and negative symptoms. Avolition continues to be a problem but it’s worse off meds.

Was thinking to drop my meds to see what would happen because I don’t know what to think-am I ill or not.am I a liar and hypocrite and is everything a lie? Why would I need antispychotics if I’m not even psychotic? My sleep pattern is funny- every alternative night I go to bed very early about 9:30pm and the next I go to bed very late about 1am. Last night got to bed past 1 am and then out of the blue Alien started attacking me and I heard voices. He put a thought in my head of stabbing my husband and then called me a murderer and that I want to do it don’t I? And a hypocrite and coward and that I must cut myself then he’d stop bothering me. I almost did but I was too cold to get up and go down to kitchen where I keep the knife. I feel like Satan is trying to get into my body through my private parts, that my winds and discharge is from him because they are evil and foul. I had a dream I went to a home for destitute women who are mentall
y ill and that I took a brick and scraped my arm over and over till I bled. I was so messed up. Is it a warning from God not to go less on my meds? I’m so confused! Why do I doubt my illness over and over?I can’t seem to understand i have one. It’s been so hard lately. I don’t know why."

Its a bit scary to be left alone like this with my fears, I still don’t believe in myself, but i’ll have to do it. Even my survival demands it. To finally start to believe in myself. So you were somatic too, _AT_MENTION_ ? Yeap, I guess the real cause is stress. But I push myself now… I make my walks, I force to socialize etc etc…I just hope it will end up by paying… So, the trick is still efforts? Yeah… Also my mind feels like asleep from so much despair through the years and isolation. It feels like I cant think, despite the fact that I think still and that I am even rational… I just have this feeling to be dumb and to not ‘‘feel’’ my thoughts, strange… I still do less that I would like to, but I try not to blame myself anymore for this, I had it quite hard enough already…"

You should want to be safe about it, and that’s true for any relationship. The age difference isn’t that weird. She’s right at that age where her career is settled, and now she might be looking to start a family. Who knows. I know in some cultures the age difference isn’t really a concern.

176164752,"More than 50% of people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) have comorbid substance use disorder (SUD). 1,2 Research illustrates that the diagnosis of a comorbid SUD is linked to poor adherence to medication, poor functional outcome and poor symptomatic outcome in FEP patients. 1 A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies show that treatment with long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI-AP) can effectively reduce the number of relapses and hospitalizations in patients with psychosis; 3-6 however, few of these studies were conducted in patients with SUD. Results from a naturalistic retrospective study show that results in patients with FEP can be extrapolated to those with FEP-SUD. https://progress.im/en/content/decreasing-relapse-and-rehospitalization-first-episode-psychosis?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=2019wsd&utm_content=accor_dasch_te1pim"

176164754,"I really needed help when I was 16/17. All I got was trouble from the police. It took being sent to a young offenders institute for them to realise I actually has psychosis, and then I got out on appeal, got treatment for my drug problem, and all was good. Bear in mind this built up since I was 11 years old, and it took over 5 years of getting into lots of trouble, and danger for others to recognise this and help me medically. Even so, the community mental health team support me more now than ever before, but it’s too little too late, and I have gotten used to just getting on as best as I can.

176164762,"It may be controversial to say this, but I have memories when I was a young child of staring at the static on the TV and finding a code/foreign language. It felt like I had autism and was hallucinating. I wrote down the language which was foreign. I think my pastor said it was Greek or some ????. This was before schizophrenia. This was in the early 1990s. I thought it was a signal coming from the moon. Or maybe God talking to me. I think it was a satellite. Then I noticed that the government can select/choose certain/single TVs and target someone/group where only certain TVs air specific information/programs in a local/single area instead of all the TVs on a certain channel or area. I had dreams about this. This would be advanced, but contributed to my schizophrenia and paranoia. In addition, I learned that “they” can watch and see us through the TV. My uncle told me stories of this too, which pretty much confirms this. Due to schizophrenia, I see “codes” and get delusions and patterns on Y
outube trailers, the news, etc. Sort of like _NAME_ in Beautiful Mind where he can see patterns in the newspapers, TV, and magazines. It causes delusions but I also find it fun and addictive where I can do it for hours. I wonder what people think about this crap."

176164767,"Hello and thanks for coming to my post First sorry for my English, I am French I write to you today because I have noticed a big problem in me. In fact I get bored of things/people rather quickly. For instance it applies in my relationships with other people, I don’t keep friends a long time. Also in my activities, I had started learning a new 3D software (Blender) I did some great things with it and now about one week I haven’t used it and done nothing. It’s a real problem because I can’t blossom in one activity. It comes with no surprise that also with purchases it happens : I bought a very nice computer to use this 3D software to the fullest but now I think that this purchase was a bit too much and I regret spending so much money on it. I also played a video game Star Citizen for some time, I enjoyed it at first, and now I think it’s flat, it has lost in intensity, and I don’t feel that enthusiastic anymore about it If you have any advices for helping that I would be glad.

176164771,So been well over ten years I’ve been on 300 mgs of effexor. It’s a pretty brutal pill for me but it’s benefits are huge. I do have some serious depression. Still. I’ve been stable so long I’m going to try coming down a bit. My first goal is getting stable on 225mgs then if that goes well down to 150. I think 150 is a reasonable goal. I know when I miss a dose of effexor because you know about it in the afternoon. It’s withdrawal is real and strong but still hopeful that I can do this. Why not try is my opinion. Shrink is all onboard so first things first I’ve a script for 75mgs…I just filled two 150’s but that is just how the pills come. Wish me luck. I envisage 6 weeks on 225mgs and if all good will go try 150 is the plan.

I used to be very frugal but I feel like I could’ve lost all my money to healthcare and I’d be in debt up to my ears anyway if anything happened. So I dunno I lost some of that “for the future” thinking. I still need to improve my habits but I can also pay my bills.

176164900,"not really, but I was, I was speaking in tongues. ha. crazy."
174384252,"I think people are different. I prefer having a few bad weeks a year over being depressed and suicidal because of meds all year long. This strategy allows me to be happy, to care for my son, to work, to love family and friends. My bad days are also caused by normal things often - problems at work, my mum being ill, feeling lonely, etc. I actually WANT to feel bad about that, however strange that may sound."
176164901,"I can feel the same way too, sometimes… My mother doesn’t ease this… But you are precious, _PERSON_. WE just have a hard illness yeap. Try to love yourself now, this bad stuff can happen to anybody, have this in mind… Hugs!!!"
174384251,Doesn’t sza depressive type already cover this?
176164902,I makes memes.
176164903,"Idk why you refuse meds, you will never be normal even without meds. Your posts seem abnormal, you were more normal when you were on meds. Idk again, its your choice and your life. I am done with the phase of stopping and changing my meds, it was hell."
174384261,"I’m not as sedated on Abilify as Zyprexa, and have only been sleeping 4 to 6 hours a day. That’s probably not good, but I like being on Abilify."

176164905,I heard upstairs neighbor say bullet. They listen to me everyday. I’m not gonna stress. I just wish I could ignore people better.
176164906,"I have this personality trait of not showing my illness. I don’t like people having pity over me. My parents are very old school and to some extent it rubbed off on me. It is a male trait of not showing “weakness”. To some it is a vice but to me it is a virtue. _AT_MENTION_ thank you, I just want to calm down, you know? I will do that, I think I lost all credibility with them oh well…"
176164907,My brother the doctor says caffeine is a good drug. He also says - Trust me; I’m a Dr.
176164908,Are you bullied as an adult? I was bullied when I was a kid but it didn’t affect me and I even became friend with who bullied me when we became adults.
176164909,I’m lucky I get SSI and get my medications for free. I have the best health and dental insurance.
176164910,Check your spam folder
176164911,I discussed this with my therapist and we said that I have been set back in terms of love due to my illness. Being aware of the need to warm up is a good first step.
176164912,I noticed a change within a few days; started feeling even better after a week or two. YMMV though. Good luck!
176164913,I’m sorry I go overboard. I don’t know if it’s an only child thing.

176164915,I never had a problem with it. When I was hospitalized at age 24 I was so skinny I qualified for double portions. The personal pizzas were really good.
176164916,I love it! So true
176164917,oh you not gonna take your shot also anymore?

176164919,I suffer from anxiety and when I’m in full panic mode I sit on the floor and do stretching exercises to either a movie or music that comforts me. Something about the tv show golden girls comforts me
176164920,I’m on 100mg sertraline and have some sexual problems. What depression meds might be better for this?
176164921,I’ll make my brother pay. I feel the same way you do except I want to murder not be murdered
176164922,"I am South Australian, but currently live in Queensland."
176164923,"My core meds are depixol depot, seroquel and fluoxetine. I am happy with these meds and the doses I am on are fine. I am also on pregabalin 200mg (for anxiety) and procyclidine (for eps). The pregabalin helps my anxiety but I have put on like 20kg on this med. not all fat either - I feel all bloated and swollen like I am constantly retaining fluids. The procyclidine is ok. But I have read it may be involved with the development of some dementias. At my next pdoc appointment in4 months I am gonna get his opinion about possibly, responsibly, discontinuing these meds. What do you think? I mean they do help and I am sure I will encounter discomfort for coming off them but is it worth it? I don’t like their side effects"
176164924,"Person I live with yells, curses and slams things when angry, and she’s frequently angry. I don’t know if she’s trying to get me to react to her anger, whether it’s my fault or not, but to me she seems to make especially sure I know she’s angry. Maybe it’s just because she knows it messes with me, or maybe she blames me for something. I feel dread when I hear her footsteps upstairs. I know it’s a bad living situation, and wish I didn’t have to occupy her space (her house). She has valid reasons to be angry at me being here. I just want to know how to deal with the anxiety of feeling like I’m guilty of something every time she’s around. I already compensate with chores and chipping in with groceries."
176164925,But I didn’t have symptoms for 2 months after quitting meds
176164926,Thanks. Over the counter Omaprozole thats all. Seems to have done the trick lol. I should do some housework - but i cant be arsed. Im having an off day.
176164927,"no, I got them, I’m going to do the rock one next I think. This one I’m doing is square. I’m really slow."
176164928,And I’m not going back until I am better. The paranoia got to a point where I’d think people are saying nasty things about me when it’s just not true. I told my manager it’s not fair on others that I’m accusing people like that. I think this the first psychosis since 10 years.
176164929,Don’t dwell in the illusion of the past or future; there is only now so be present in it…
176164930,Nothing wrong with having the odd wank. Religions programmed society into thinking it was bad and sinful. Its only ever a problem - if it takes over the majority of your time or your harming others with it. Dirty books are better (Honestly) lol.
176164931,Yes I can’t wait to get to bed Morning is ok for me Afternoon I get lots anxiety so I long for bedtime
176164932,"Whey isolate doesn’t affect your meds or disease. Its good for weight loss. I studied Athletic Therapy and the teacher said we don’t need any supplements for exercise, they’re just marketing. If it really improved athletic performance they would be illegal and called doping."
176164933,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ maybe tomorrow will be a better day
176164934,getting the boog out is worth getting caught with your finger in your nose haha.

176164938,Looking good. Well done!
176164939,Good advice _AT_MENTION_ ! I’m going to make a note
176164940,I appreciate your reply.thank you
176164941,This is a pro meds forum. We believe supplements and a healthy lifestyle compliment antipsychotic use.
176164942,I sometimes see numbers and letters on my neck. Sometimes I step over animals that are not there.sometimes I swat bugs off my arms that are not there. … I’ve hallucinated so many things I really wouldn’t know where to start.
176164943,I agree. I don’t have any respect for therapists.
176164944,Yes. I’m on Trazodone 50 mg.

176164946,everhopeful that made me cry now
176164947,Makes me think I don’t like psychosis.
176164948,"I was weighed in January 2020 for my annual health check and I was 96 kilos. Since then I am now 71 Kilos. Have I lost too much weight too fast? This is a good thing, but I think I am losing muscle now I am getting paranoid about my upper chest just below my tits, as I can feel just bone there and no muscle. For my job I need to be strong, and I am worried I am now wasting muscle and I do not know how to control weight loss without tipping back into weight gain Been here before. Gained weight, lost weight gained weight lost weight. I don’t think this is healthy"
176164949,That’s great _AT_MENTION_! I saw a movie at church Sunday evening. It was enjoyable.
176164950,"Or you can stop smoking, smoking is a bad habit."
176164951,Part two. You are unfair. Nothing worse than that. Treat people like rubbish. With your dumb sarcasm Etc etc etv
176164952,I never trusted preworkouts and these supplements. I stayed on whey protein isolate instead and was taking one scoop per day.
174384260,"_AT_MENTION_ I hope so! That’s a great start! Good luck! When I was on Abilify, I gained 50 pounds. Once I stopped it, the weight came off on its own without a change in eating habits. I guess there are some APs that just don’t agree with us. Maybe it will be that way for you and Zyprexa. 30 mg is a large dose. I have lost 25 pounds since starting Zyprexa, but I am only on 7.5 mg. and I have been meticulous with my eating. The most Zyprexa I was on was 10 mg until my pdoc and I discovered that 7.5 is my lowest effective dose. That probably helps me when it comes to combating weight gain. I may not have been able to be so successful with my weight loss at 30 mg."

176164954,I’ve found no problems. In fact. I last a hell of a lot longer so it’s not a bad thing on my meds. I take zyprexa and effexor and have found that opportunity usually fixes what you think are problems.
176164955,Let us know which one she put you on and how it’s going.
174384257,"I’m incredibly depressed today. As some of you may know, i work as a nurse full time. My job has always been so important to me, but i’m noticing a change. I guess you could call them negative symptoms, i don’t know. I just don’t care about myself as much, i do little to care for myself. It was noted in a meeting i had today with one of the service managers that i had an unkept appearance, among other things. My work appears to be suffering also. I feel so hopeless. I feel as though i’m watching an inevitable deterioration in my functionality. It is getting harder and harder to work full time, harder and harder to look after myself…But i don’t want to end up on disability support as it isn’t enough to survive on. My partner and i were hoping to buy a unit soon, and that certainly can’t be done if i no longer work. I just don’t know what to do anymore."
176164956,"I’ve used drugs a lot in my life and I’ve struggled with addictions my whole life. I’ve used meth, cocaine, lsd, weed, shrooms, and norcos and I’ve been addicted to meth and norcos and I’ve struggled with alcohol use, not saying I’m an alcoholic, just saying I’ve not made the best choices when it’s come to alcohol and it could be a problem if I kept going down that road. For me using was a coping mechanism. Mostly coping with my mood disorder, but also voices too."
176164957,So far it’s not reading my steps from Google Fit like it’s supposed to. Annoying. Help system is useless.
176164958,Oh my gosh! How horrible!
176164959,"Wow, that is exactly what I’ve been experiencing!!! I’ve been on and off antipsychotics for the last year and a half or so and I’ve noticed my speech and vocabulary is just not what it used to be. I had no idea antipsychotics could do that, but that scares me a lot."
176164960,"I feel exactly the same way too It’s ok. People just didn’t know any better I don’t think, so none of it I take personally. The stuff I take personally is that I think all these druggies were more on the ball, and knew exactly how to exploit my weaknesses I didn’t even know about. That’s the sad thing about all this I used to be highly intelligent and very good at science and maths. Now I am damaged by not only pre-longed drug use as a teen, but also the impact of SZ and anxieties etc etc Just seems like such a waste, but I am happy doing something creative that’s outside and keeping me fit. Much better place now. I hope you are doing better now you have some time to develop outside of a toxic schooling environment! Being an adult kicks ass!"

176164963,I think the fact you are considering it is a good sign. Most people that don’t work know it is not an option.
174384264,I don’t really think it’s a good topic for people with a psychotic disorder. There’s tons of threads on reddit to indulge in that thinking for ya
176164964,I feel some what better. I’m worried my np will take me off of perphenazine.
176164965,It’s nice you got to see them. How is he holding up with everything? Have you heard from your daughter at all?
176164966,Thanks. I’ve had severe psychotic symptoms for almost 6 years and almost constantly. it’s felt like I’ve been existing in multiple hell realms…

176164968,"I hate time, 11:11, I feel something bad will happen or bad luck."
176164969,I’m really sorry to hear. It’s a tough one to swallow. I don’t know how to resolve such a thing. At least no advice I found online helped me in dealing with it. Feels worse when you can’t even communicate to the other person and your sexual orientation alone is an embarrassment and no one around me could possibly relate or help me through it for that reason too.
176164970,"I believe that each person can go through certain experiences, crazy or not, that no one else can go through or understand. For us, it may be a delusion. But then again it might be some life experience that is unique to that individual. On some things, no one else can be in your shoes."

174384265,If Vraylar works and my negative symptoms get reduced? On Abilify I was able to hold jobs for 1 month and not more. Does that mean that sz did permanent brain damage? Before schizophrenia I worked 3+ years in the same work. Was never been able to do the same after sz.

Total haul was two pairs of winter gloves (one for wife, one for kid), and a red winter fleece hood/mask as _PERSON_ freezes her face off at the bus stop right now.

176165042,"Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_ ! I hope you receive some much needed support here. The people are wonderful! I was hospitalized multiple times and for months at a time, attended therapy, and was on meds from 2002-2005. Then, for a decade without meds/therapy/hospitalization I worked full-time, lived on my own, volunteered at church and in the community, had a ton of friends, served on short-term mission trips around the world, married, and had kids. I started slipping in 2013 but I didn’t realize what was happening until I was gone in 2014. You need to see a doctor. There’s a possibility that it will get worse. Your job matters, but it doesn’t matter as much as your mental health. It’s better to be on meds than for your coworkers to see you in full blown psychosis."

When I got to the next borough the whole place was under police lockdown until they found out what was going on. Then the super intendent said “make them mad again” and everything settled down just about. I didn’t find the experience pleasant. I respect the need for government, but I dislike fascism.

176165050,"Due to my current mental state along with my living situation, I am considering putting myself in the psychiatric hospital again. I don’t want to get too deep into what’s going on, but I will say that I have been having suicidal thoughts that aren’t getting any better and I’m currently in a very hectic living situation that I can’t get out of since I’m under adult guardianship due to my disabilities. The only way I feel like I can be safe with myself is if I turn myself into the hospital, as much as I don’t want to do that. The only two problems are that I’m conflicted because I have a lot of good things happening for me soon but I can’t keep tolerating my situation, and that I’ve never been to an adult ward. I’ve been to child and adolescent wards as a youngster but I’m 19, going on 20, and I’ve never been to the adult ward.

I kept telling her there’s no need, I don’t have episodes any more. It was weird how insistent she was though. I’m surprised he/she didn’t tell you to socialize more.

I am not fit in many ways so this may be detrimental to offspring, hopefully it wouldnt affect it that much but it is not for me to decide. i think there is a monster that feeds off of all of this, looking for a reason to dish out punishment, its hard to know what is to blame sometimes."

Have you gone through this? It’s been 3 years of doing nothing. I had 2 months (2 years ago) where I suddenly “woke up” and started a landscaping biz and took online courses for a bachelor’s in

Note, I’m sorry for my behavior on this site in the past too. Especially the post where it sounded like I was going to off myself…I’m very ashamed and will try to stay away from the forum, but I don’t know where else I can ask or find people who may have gone through something similar. I understand if you hate me, but if you can help despite that feeling, then maybe I won’t be such a piece of ???? one day. I became the ‘bleh’ I am today because of abuse. And I failed to ever learn how to do what is normal to prevent being a target, in fact I’m so stubborn about it, I choose to be a freak, basically. I don’t know if being passable in public as not a freak is possible at this stage. I’m not even looking for that, I will probably always be a recluse so my evil won’t spread. I just want to prev

176165128,"I must agree it is very nice to find someone able to discuss these topics at a level that is able to keep up and purpose compelling ideas and arguments to consider or validate my own whichever may become lol. My issue with the duality of particles vs waves is that we have the understanding of how waves function yet most choose to stick to the belief of newtonian physics which requires everything to be particles, so they condense all the information we have of wave function into particle reaction ie. Proton packets in order to get it to abide by the properties they believe it should. It does propose a significant dilemma to attempt to observe these base waves interacting and how they should react given a specific reactant although I believe with a substantial sinusoidal mathematic application we should be able to get a relativity accurate understanding although most “experts” hesitate to do this because it may disprove centuries of belief and understanding and would at the very least be labor in
tensive if the math to do it has even been created yet. I believe our “conscience” minds are limited in understanding in order to focus our learning to a level that is necessary for our “harmonious advancement” that’s why the senses we use daily are limited to the traditional 5, however there is evidence by the “quantum activist” I forget his name that there is more connectivity between our minds then we are currently able to detect. _PERSON_’s uncertainty principal regarding location is entirely dependent on observation through photon refraction adjusting the course of a wave/ particle however if we are able to have awareness of these things without the need for light then it would literally change everything we know or think we know about quantum mechanics and how things operate."

174384308,"I wish I could understand all the info, from what I gather it’s similar in how it stimulates part of the brain with ect but with little to no cognitive side effects. The name is scary tho. At least you’re under anesthesia. And it’s more intended for treatment resistant sz. _PERSON_ for new ways to treat sz."
176165157,"Really? That’s a lot of people. I wonder how the government plans to stop them. I hope nobody gets hurt doing this. I know it seems like good fun, but to them it’s a danger to their facility."
176165158,Welcome to the forum! I have not seen you around before. Are you new?
176165159,Yes I’ve gotten better at not being manipulated though. I’d consider myself street smart now but I used to be street idiot.

176165161,"I think that could be a great solution. When someone is hearing voices, we don’t tell them to just deal with it. We tell them to distract with music or something."
176165162,"I don’t think you’re doing anything wrong by saying you don’t want kids. You should have the right to say no. Its your body and its probably going to be your time spent raising them, and if you don’t want to do it now, going through with it is a very bad idea. This kind of fundamental conflict ideally would have been discussed before marriage."
176165163,Can you get a different psychiatrist?
174384313,"I have severe cognitive issues. I was unable to perform at work. We had to memorize so much information to do our jobs. I fell behind. My boss to his credit tried to work with me. They were very good to me. But I couldn’t do the work, not for lack of trying. I would go home to my parents and agonize about it. Finally I had to stop working. _USER_ID_: I have paucity of thought too or I used to. When planning for a social situation, I used to research and memorize things I could talk about with that person and save it in Notes. I called it my talking points memo. I frequently ran out of things to say and would refer to my phone for more. It wasn’t like this when I was young. I need much longer time to put my thoughts together. On a zoom meeting last week I embarrassed myself trying to make a toast. I couldn’t think of a single word. It was mortifying."

176165168,"Gatorade really helps with the brain zaps from antidepressant withdrawal. Magnesium supplements can also help, but check with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure they dont interact with anything, and don’t take too much or else it causes diarrhea. Good luck, the first two weeks are the hardest."

176165170,"It’s hard living with residual symptoms after doing all you can to be properly medicated. I live with them everyday. We still have to fight the delusions, Even if it’s easier to just fall into them. Sure, it’d be nice to be a llama for a little bit, to get away from it all, But I’m sure you’d rather be a little crazy _NAME_ you. Keep trying hard everyday and eventually it won’t be as difficult. You’ll have less questions and be able to cope with the ones you have better. That’s been my experience."
176165171,Starting Prozac is rough for a week or two anyway but you just have to stick at. It may help and it may not help after that but its worth a shot

176165173,"Headache has been getting tons better since eating 60-120 grams protein and 1 tbsp L-Citrulline (arginine precursor) a day, which are definitely healing the damage. I have prolonged moments of feeling normal now. Decided to become an expert C++ programmer, but not sure where exactly on the huge pie to start chomping. Something to do with input device development. Had some nice burgers."
176165174,"I have never taken meds & have actively experienced symptoms for around 2 years now. I define my “health” by how much I can function. For whatever reason, my brain does ok with keeping one foot in reality & one foot in psychosis-land. The key is to not spend too much time in the latter (otherwise my functionality drops considerably). I see a psychiatrist & a therapist regularly, neither of which think medication is necessary if I don’t. All this being said, I’m not “anti-medication”…I know it helps so many people who are seriously plagued by their psychoses. I guess at the end of the day, though, I don’t really consider “symptom free” to be a necessary indicator of mental health."

176165178,It is! Since February!
176165179,It makes some ppl zombies but for me being a zombie is better than being violent off meds and ending up in prison probably for life.
176165180,I live alone and I love it. People make me paranoid. I don’t know why. I guess they stress me out too much. I know I do much better both mood and thought wise when I’m by myself.
176165181,"Taking your ap for you, might seem like a waste of time, but it might settle you into an equilibrium where you know what you’re in for day to day. I think because I take them religiously that I’m biased but if you’re taking them sometimes and not all the time you’re giving yourself the worst impression of them you can get. The principle benefits build up over time. Its like brushing your teeth, you don’t know there’s a problem skipping until you feel pain, and by then its too late. Tooth is gone."
174384311,I really have 0 motivation and organization. I told my psychiatrist and he said there is no meds yet for negative and cognitive symptoms. The best they have is Abilify but I had bad side effects from it.

176165191,I think grandiosity is a failure of the brain to acknowledge the existence of the other 8 billion people on earth. The odds of any one of us being that important are so incredibly small. Each of us is like a grain of sand on the beach. The odds of becoming famous are like 50 million to one.

176165196,Did you ever try day treatment?
176165197,Ya 5 dimensional stuff. I feel like society is revealing itself. Its evilness. I feel like end times. A lot of folks feel this way.
176165198,yea i had similar things happen to me. They made me do kindergarten third year twice and then just send me to elementary school where i didn’t do well. My pdoc also said now they would diagnose me quickly and would send me to special school and that prob would have been better for me. School time was hard for me. I’m glad now i don’t have to go through that anymore but i still have traumas from it. Sorry to hear you had to go through that too =(

176165203,I don’t want to think bad thoughts about them. Or have intrusive thoughts that they can hear. I am so afraid of thinking intrusive thoughts about celebrities and their relatives. I feel someone out there hates me and putting these voices in my mind. The voices said I was going to die but I hope not Not soon nor ever.
176165204,"So glad we could help keep you safe! I hope your pdoc is able to talk to you tomorrow. If your symptoms get overwhelming in the meantime, the ER is always an option. But tomorrow is not far away."

176165207,it’s a bummer you can’t try clozapine =(
176165208,TMG helps with the anhedonia part. May be its due to SAMe. Its good for workout gives the pump up feeling. I tried TMG from swanson brand. The problem with TMG is capsules get sticky very fast even if its placed in air tight container so don’t stock it. Then there is another thing called DMG which is light form of TMG. TMG is stimulating while DMG not like that thus if you have problem falling asleep at night then DMG might be better especially if planning to take it daily. Anyway do consult with your doctor before trying especially if taking antidepressant as it can amplify the effect of antidepressants.

176165233,"Well it may be this partially for me anyways. I did also get some nonsense talk besides that, what is stopping you from going on an antipsychotic? would it not be nice for those voices to stop? and even when they stop, if they stop, it is important to stay on the antipsychotic for quite a while, idk how long exactly, it might even be for life. even if lets suppose they are real, would it not be nice to attempt to get rid of them? having a quiet mind is the best thing imo…"
176165234,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ you’re really kind.
176165235,"No if it was just for sleep I would have stopped it it is the only med that has ever helped with my overactive bladder. My bladder had been flared up extremely bad for months and I could find no relief and finally I went from peeing 10x a night basically having to go as soon as I got comfortable in bed again to not having to go at night at all. It is a blessing. But it has been causing me so many problems, making it impossible to wake up in the morning and giving me the severe sleep paralysis hallucinatory episodes. I think it is because I have to take it so late bc when I was on it before I took it at like 7 or 8 and did not have these issues. I don’t have a choice to take it then though as my job shift will be ending at 11 pm so I cant take it earlier. I wish I could find a different med that helped w my bladder. None of the traditional bladder meds i tried did anything. It was so bad."

I don’t believe that there is “one Humanity” but I’d prefer to think humanity as a very different individuals who have their customs, their habits, their hobbies, their beliefs and so on. I conceive of humanity as a species, but it is actually hard to me to consider humanity in the philosophical and spiritual sense. At the top of the “pyramid” there are also often very self-absorbed people who would kill anyone who gets in their way to power. If we consider that there is a humanity in the philosophical and spiritual sense, and if this is a “whole”, then we have interest in questioning itself (for itself and for the rest of living species …)"

Thanks for all of the kind replies…didn’t mean to be such a Drama Queen about all of this. Just wanted to share some thoughts I had about this forum while all of this craziness is going on around the world."
176165290,Hi _AT_MENTION_ good to hear from you! I’m on amisulpride 200-300mg depending on my symptoms. And I don’t think I’ve gained weight from it. As far as I know it’s not a side effect of amisulpride. The weight I’ve gained was on olanzapine which I’m taking too.
176165291,"Tall my boyfriend was, while I was talking to him on the phone, when I was 15. He was 6’. Then she started flirting, making loud comments so he could hear. I don’t know why it made me angry, but we ended up fighting. I wish I had been more mature."
176165292,After losing five kg I put one kg back on in just two days. I think it’s because I was upset so I did some binge eating. Trying not to feel to disappointed about it but instead just start again and get back on track . My brother doesn’t have breakfast only coffee. He is eats so little in a day n is so disciplined. I should be more disciplined.
176165293,"Thank you, brother. Everything OK with you?"

176165319,"I agree with you that it can be exhausting when certain folks get stuck on the “woe is me” train. It’s one thing to vent every once in a while but if you are not actively making any effort into making changes in your life and are just sitting around expecting things to change and then bemoaning when they do not that is frustrating, sad and annoying for others to deal with I think."
176165320,"I understand entirely what you mean it’s a ‘fake it till you make it’ philosophy, nobody wants to question if we’re dealing with brainwashing from an outside source, they just say ‘take yer damn meds’ and pretend it’s all natural"

176165337,Lots of hugs for you.
176165338,Yes. _AT_MENTION_ is good common sense.
176165339,I spent a few years experimenting with other AP’s after Olanzapine made me put on a load of weight. Was the best decision I made. Unfortunately you have to pick you poison as in what side effects you want to have. Weight gain is now a red line for me I refuse anything that has this listed as common. Currently I pick on that gives me high prolactin and cholesterol

176165343,I hope so. I don’t really want to go. But at this point of a lot of stress i feel as though my head will implode since I dont leave the house or whateber it means to be inside confined in a two story on a bad side of town. Im tired and worn out. I lost every notion of what my family is i think they are imposters or strangers
176165344,"Il never be safe anywhere, I say they’d follow me anywhere, _NAME_ said he’d even follow me to America. Maybe they wouldn’t follow me if I went, depends on if the voices were real or not. I think they left me alone in 2019 don’t know why maybe they don’t make people hear voices and thought I was really sick, maybe they do make people hear voices and felt I suffered enough. I have no way of knowing if they make people hear voices. Think they may just want to give me some sort of life changing injury"
176165345,"I rock back and forth all of the time. I told my former pdoc about it and he said, “That must be comforting”. (He was a genius in his field, by the way). Anyway, I also kick my feet when I am in a sitting position. It seems to bug some people because others have commented on it. I also press my lips together repeatedly as a habit. I have been doing this for over 50 years and I hate it immensely but, I can’t stop. I’m not autistic either."
176165346,"my shortest stay was 1 month, 4 months my longest. my local hospital is not that nice, the food is good though. no music therapy or anything like that though, and someone is always watching daytime television like dr _NAME_ or judge _NAME_ on tv. it drives me crazy, i hate daytime tv, it is cruel and unusual punishment. last time i was there, there was this young kid bragging about his opiod addiction and how many pills he was taking a week. maybe that is why he was in there i dont know."
174384350,Yes that’s what Abilify caused me and that’s what the FDA and Health Canada warned about. Abilify bottles have warning about impulsivity since 2017. The guide that comes with the medication.
176165347,"I’ve shared a lot about and during my psychosis to people and on social media. Today I kept noticing 1p penny coin in my pocket and then it was placed in a shower by my mom, any other valuable coins were removed (I had delusions about coins) or maybe she wants to tell that I literally don’t have my own money? Also I had an obsession to smoke cannabis leftovers from the floor, so my mom poured some grinded tea leaves on a floor and left me to notice. She often upbrings some things to shock me or irritate. I’ve come to a conclusion that she tries to psychosis check on me, which is quite frightening and I feel really uncomfortable. Maybe because I have been having sleepless nights and because maybe o bought some cannabis tea from grocery shop. I don’t know, should I confront her? Does you family members also does this to you?"
176165348,Thanks for the well wishes I’ll make an appointment Another one
176165349,At least make sure your dr knows. And if you see a case mgr let them know too

176165355,"So today at 2pm I’m going to see my new Pdoc . I don’t know a whole lot about her. I suspect it’s going to be me describing my symptoms again. What I want to work on, medication history. I’m nervous, and the voices are calling me a liar, telling me no one believes me. I’m faking it, it isn’t real, no one can help me, I’ll join them in hell. Took a PRN. This all means I have to shower today, it’s been a few. Least I try to keep on top of brushing every day. Questions I have involve what kind of medications they would recommend. What therapies. How can I get rid of the voices. Generally a “wtf do I do?” In more polite manners. Any input for good questions I could ask? What are some you ask? Thanks everyone,"
176165356,She was born with no eyesight. My Aunt has had her all her life. She was very shy. She was quite old. She died suddenly. We all took the bus over to go bury her this morning for my Auntie because she’s 82 and there’s no way she could do it herself. It was so sad. The moment we laid her in the ground all the neighborhood dogs started howling. It gave us all chills.

176165359,Yes please explain
176165360,They never do. If I am to get out of this I need to act. There is no help unless you’re a problem. It’s well deserved

176165363,3 big ones where I needed hospitalization. Then many others where I could semi function for a while. All involved some form of mania and paranoia.
176165364,Yeah I thought the same. I was thinking they were gonna visit me last night and put a knife to my throat and quietly tell me to leave. My voices told me I was in a provos house so they couldn’t enter it but I’d say that’s just a courtesy. Wish I knew if what my voices were telling me was true

176165371,Was i ever delusional though?
176165372,"My voices tell me I’m asleep and dreaming like an awakened subconscious existence but you just have to realize that everything is real but people have so many theories and ideas that you can easily isolate yourself into nothing. They tell me if I kill myself I will wake up again. I think of multi dimensional existence or rebirth all the time and other stuff but the best thing you can do is take a second, look around, talk to someone, do something, touch something, just reconnect to everything you know as absolute. In reality we are who we are and will continue to be that until and even after death because no matter what you are real and you make an impact whether you feel it or not"
176165373,Thanks again _AT_MENTION_!
176165374,"When people say “the average person”, you will find that in fact there is no such thing as an average person. There is no such thing as an all round average person. It would be a statistical anomaly to ever find one. Thus, when it comes to an average sz, or an average sza you may find some people share some of the characteristics, but not all. No one is exactly the same you see and the exact average sz person doesn’t exist, or average neurotypical either. Normal, and if you mean by that “average”, is rather than a brain that isn’t affected by mental illness at all then truly that too doesn’t exist. That person just doesn’t exhibit the “average” sz reactions, but who knows what other thought patterns mimic the same thought patterns of a mentally ill person that they just don’t display in public. What I am trying to say is that the average normal person doesn’t exist either as we are all unique and react differently to the world around us. If you put an individual in the menta
lly ill category, then in that template it ticks several of the boxes, but not all, some other boxes will be ticked in another individual and some shared. The template is that this person is mentally ill, but different to another mentally ill person. Some people are triggered by a certain trauma, whereas the same trauma to another may not affect them. The average normal example to this reaction is impossible to define in actuality. It just remains a statistical probability."
174384357,"I dont think it is an either/or thing… I think sz causes isolation, but also isolation and trauma can increase the risk of developping schizophrenia. I think it is both genes and environment and which plays a bigger role varies per person. I was the only one of my siblings who was abused, and also the one who got sz. The others are fine. I got issues right after abuse, and they worsened with more abuse. Before that i wasnt anxious or isolated at all. With healing trauma stuff, my anxiety and delusions improve."

174384361,"I function better now than before psychosis. I think I just matured though, and have learned how to manage stress."
174384363,"I really hear you _AT_MENTION_. But I have disclosed my schizophrenia probably to a hundred different people. Just random acquaintances who it came up in conversation with, throughout the years. All of my close friends know about it, as well as the gross close-up details revealed through whichever shared experience led to me being visibly in psychosis, and my best friend is my greatest support. Some people have questions. And yeah, a very very few amount of people (like 3 in said 100) seem to make it a vendetta to spread rumors, condescend to you, avoid you, or even ??????? hospitalize you. Just stay the ???? away from them. But you know what? The vast majority of people who I’ve disclosed to have never cared. Some people are super curious, and maybe want to put you in a display case to satisfy their curiosity and romanticizing, but the intention is only their curiosity. They don’t know that’s harmful in its own ways. But most people are totally cool, and you go on with your relationship as n
ormal. My motivations for disclosing to so many people were a likening of my diagnosis to my sexual orientation – I viewed it as fundamentally a political vulnerability. I had to come out as gay/bi, so I figured the best way to normalize SZ and other severe mental illnesses was to disclose it as if it were nothing, just another fact of personal existence. Like being gay. However, after having some terrible risks come upon me because of the 2-3% of people who judged me because of the Dx, I’ve decided to be less naively idealistic, and take more precautions of trust. Good luck."
176165389,Its possible i once read about women having a second window where they get diagnosed alot and its around that age if i recall correctly. Also there is drug induced psychosis and that happens at any age. If u can get her to go get assessed it might help her out.

I’ve been very emotionally unstable and having my father reinforcing my fears with medication has… not helped me at all. Reading everyones comments encouraging me to stay medicated helped me a lot so I wanted to say thank you to everyone who gave me their input. My doctor upped my mood stabilizers to help me as well."

176165417,Authentic? And you’re going to get that by knowingly lying to yourself? That doesn’t even make sense.
176165418,My dad is probably the most happy and stable of my family. I would say I’m happier than my mom and brother but they refuse to get proper treatment for their mental illnesses
176165419,From the moment I get to work I want to go home. But I manage
176165420,I often can’t sleep for days and suddenly sleep 24 hours straight! Not sleeping is awful. I hope you find sleep soon.
176165421,Yeah it’s hard. _PERSON_ can bite too. Still. Set an alarm and force yourself up at a reasonable time in the morning. You might need a nap but you can slowly change things around and get a better routine. Being organised really does help with things.
176165422,I have the hobby of gaming which I’m enjoying again these days. Hard for me to really enjoy much else though. I’m sort of low energy to try much else.
176165423,Bad people want me to appear crazy and become a med zombie for the rest of my life.
176165424,"I second _AT_MENTION_ in sleeping it off. I normally get suicidal around night time and then I go to bed early and normally wake up ok. If you can sleep I recommend tweaking your meds with your doctor as this is something that happens every once in awhile to the best of us, and normally it means we need to make a change."
176165425,_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry lol
176165426,Maybe it sounds degrading to low functioning and undermining struggles of high functioning?
176165427,"Its actually weird,"
176165428,"Seriously, what even is normal? We’re just on a large spectrum of insanity. Just varying degrees."
176165429,"They’re were many things done to keep me from reaching my income potential, then they claim you’re just sitting around. I wouldn’t have needed financial assistance, if people weren’t always committing crimes against people."
176165430,Take your meds.
176165431,_AT_MENTION_ Hi there. I’d be particularly interested in knowing your answer to my post. Your diagnosis is schizotypal disorder rather than sz so it would be interesting to see what your take is. Could I just be schizotypal with all these beliefs?
176165432,hehehe =D it’s good that you don’t have to
176165433,"it was a job at a small food place, probably the least stressful when compared to most like fast food places but still it wasnt for me"
176165434,I’m sorry you have been upset. I hope you have a nice relaxing supper.
176165435,I have never heard of anyone eating the peel.
176165436,I feel so much better this morning. Thank you for being here…and thank you for your support. My mom and I talked about this last night and I feel so much better now.
176165437,Without meds I am disabled.
176165438,"There is a weight loss calculator www.calculator.net that says for my age, height, weight, and activity level I should eat 1400 calories a day for a 2lb a week loss. 1900 will give me 1lb loss. But it said to contact your doctor if less than 1500 a day. I just sent a message to my doctor to see if 1400 was okay with her. I’m old so it’s harder to lose weight."
176165439,And here I was thinking that I hadn’t seen one of these posts in a while.
176165440,"No, i don’t know. I think it’s something called PNES. That’s what they call it when they can’t se the seizures when they scan your brain. They say it’s something psychological. I have only had 3 grand mal, and a few small episodes, and i’m not afraid to have another. Glad you can drive a car, i guess it’s impossible to manage a life without a car in the states."
176165441,"Idk, I always tell my psychiatrist I’m fine but maybe I might have Major Depressive disorder or something. I don’t like attention on me but I’m starting to get discouraged."
176165442,I think oneday im going to go off meds !!
176165443,Oh my lol 151515
176165444,Hi everyone. ? have one question about avpd. ? m not sure that this disorder at me or not. ? just feel like nobody likes me. And when i sit to someone next to chair i feel like s/he just go away just because of me.or when i m go somewhere i feel like disturbing people.is this related to avpd? ?f not what kind of disorder is this?
174384374,"Thanks so much for connecting. It’s so good to connect with someone else who has schizotypal disorder. I don’t know anyone and don’t understand my illness. Do it sounds like you had some progression of illness. I have too. I’ve lost so much so much functioning since 2011 slowly worse and worse. It’s devastating. Since 3-4 years I can’t work, and can’t do most things I used to, or with a great deal of difficulties. I used to highly function. I don’t hear voices either. But when I get really ill I suffer from a lot of paranoia. I always see minor illusions and sometimes hallucinations, do you? They are much worse when I’m I’ll. Maybe this is the bipolar piece. Do you have something like what people call ‘negative symptoms’? Did you end up losing a lot of motivation and passion for life? And feel stuck unable to move for a lot of the day? Sorry for all the questions! and for putting up with my long post! _AT_MENTION_"
176165445,The voices are not dieties
176165446,I don’t know what a trumanomatrix is.
176165447,"Someone is psychicly abusing and torturing me and I feel like everyone hates me, they want to shoot me, I need to get them out of my body and mind, please help They are low lifes."
176165448,I feel like I can’t because I don’t want my siblings to be moved and also from a young age I was taught to not trust them I’m assuming so me and my siblings wouldn’t call them like my brother did multiple times. Also didn’t help that a CPS worker lied to me saying they were my new counselor in order to try and get information from me which didn’t work anyways because I have a fear of counselors and stuff so I wouldn’t have spilled either way but that was some time ago. Sorry not much direction I’m very tired and not proof reading anything.
176165449,They sound like total losers and they probably won’t attract anyone who loves and respects them until they learn to love and respect other people.
176165450,"The mods don’t read every post. Religion is highly triggering for a lot of people here. The rules are in the guidelines. Posts are removed for mentioning someone’s religious beliefs and for having a focus on religion that is not in a recovery context (e.g. talking about and trying to work through one’s religious delusions). Basically, just avoid triggering people’s psychosis with religious talk. It’s not worth it."
176165451,Is it possible you suffer from low self esteem and are looking for a way to radically redefine yourself by changing your appearance? There’s nothing really wrong with trying out new things even if they are radically different. But I would look into why you feel compelled to do it.
176165452,"I have allergies every year. This year seems very bad. I broke down and got some pseudoephederine which works great to unblock the sinuses and the lungs but I’m angry and bitchy. Also I’m worried because they make meth out of it somehow. How does that turn into meth? Is it really dangerous I wonder? With my history I get worried it will trigger me somehow. I guess I’m just being paranoid or need something to worry about. Next lifetime I’m coming back as a redwood tree, being a human is too stressful."
176165453,if it isn’t then it kinda is huh… but if it is high then it’s just normal to think it’s high. If you know what i mean…
176165454,Try the _PERSON_ diet supposed to lose a lot
176165455,i use twinings english breakfast tea yummy been thinking if i get a strainer and just use leaf then its better for the environment i guess and it a bit more classy haha

174384496,"If you are concerned about negatives, you should try asenapine It’s the most potent antipsychotics for negatives ATM and it’s coming off patent soon. Or you can try rexulti which is an improved abilify but it’s pretty expensive"
176165459,My Self has no boundaries
176165460,_AT_MENTION_ says he’s feeling it at 500mg. So start out small. Let us know how it goes !
176165461,"Sorry you had a rough morning. It will pass. It always does. These things come in cycles. I get hit with the urge to run away at the strangest times, still."
174384376,I just want him to respect my needs And understand that I’m hurt I don’t want him to just brush it off I want him to validate what I feel Because it’s real to me Im hurt that he masterbated And he needs to know he’s wrong for not validating my feelings And I will not get back with him untill he learns his lesson I tried to be very patient with him… When I was younger when my dad left us I pretended to be sick so he’d stay and take care of me That’s how I got schizophrenia I pretended to see things until it became a real illness And now I’m paying for it…

176165464,"They do treat us like criminals more than they want to help us I think. The _USER_ID_ is still quite big, even in the health care industry."
174384502,Classic negative symptoms. I feel the same. Anyways tell your psychiatrist what you told us he should know if its negative symptoms or ADHD.
174384378,"Its not without problems but smaller problems than without meds. I still have negative symptoms, not sure if its from meds since sz itself can cause negative symptoms."
176165465,You can do it _AT_MENTION_ . I believe in you
176165466,Wow. Looks the business. Sure they taste awesome. Congrats.
176165467,Intrusive thoughts
176165468,Oh. I’m sorry about that 162515
176165469,"Well spotted, it sure looks that way"
176165470,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ yes I will bring them up with my doctor and therapist.
176165471,How long did each process take
176165472,I’m also swallowing more than usual. It’s weird.
176165473,"I spend 2 weeks back home from college break. Needless to say I should have done a ton of important things here, some paperwork, important shopping things, getting a haircut and many others. Today is my flight back and I have done anything of the important things i should have done."
176165474,I know. I’m wishing the U.S Election Day would just get here already… so I can update the worries that are on my plate.
174384506,"If I get voices, I can tell they are not real and that they come from my mind, not from a physical location (from head or elsewhere). It’s usually like hearing someone talking in your mind. The voices can have a gender (female, male, or “middle gender”) or no gender. They 99% of the time don’t sound like anyone I know. They can have a personality (occasionally they talk sadistic talk). The thoughts my schizophrenia produces can talk to me in 2nd person, just like the voices."
176165475,"Sorry man, I didnt mean you personally. I see how it came across now. I’ve just lost friends when they have gotten obsessively involved in an obscure religion or cult that is designed to control members rather than letting them be themselves."
176165476,Married 20 years on the 14th!
176165477,Im glad you’re feeling a little better _AT_MENTION_ I was in a similar situation myself
176165478,I feel this way during yoga
176165479,"_AT_MENTION_ when you say it can make symptoms worse, would I notice something wrong (in terms of making symptoms worse) if I started taking vraylar (new med) and kept taking my old med (zyprexa, which works without a problem) at the same time? Or would I only notice it when I was no longer taking the zyprexa and only taking vraylar? Sorry if my explanation is confusing, please let me know if so and I will explain it another way"
176165480,I’m on the abilify injection too so you were partially right
176165481,I believe I have found success in being myself. I used to follow the crowd and do as others said. I finally speak up for myself. So now I’m happy. All the extra stuff are just perks.
174384381,I Quite Agree!! That Dx Haunted me for bloody years!!!

176165488,It seems like all my thoughts come from the voices it’s scary and even the good ones I had thought it was my gourden angel giving me good thoughts to fight off the bad ones but now I realize it’s all the bad voices doing this. There was a scary time when I smoked weed their was a demon and an angel battling in my head and now i realize it was the evil the whole time does any one else have this? It seems like I have no more thoughts of my own

174384384,"I realized that since 2009 all of my self-published books have been available or sold from Amazon around the world and I’ve never been paid. I don’t know why they didn’t pay me. I had assumed that people just weren’t buying them but I mean come on ten years later and I’m now listed as an Author on Google and I’ve never been paid for a single sale? I contacted amazon attorneys. I also contacted a local family attorney. Hopefully, I can make the case for the copyright infringement, not being paid, not being communicated with, they recently closed my regular account on amazon so I had to make a new one, unfair discrimination. I feel like because I have schizophrenia I get taken advantage of a lot more when it comes to financial discrimination. Thoughts?"

Idk what to do im so ??????? fed up with this ????.

The fee will be extra for the 24-48 hour processing but time is money. Man: Yeah it is man and it’s well worth it too. Agent: How can I reach you? Man: You can reach me by cell. I’ll be in another state but I’ll be glad to hear from you. Are we done? Agent: Yes but why are you in such a hurry. Man: _NAME_ can’t wait forever.

176165502,Sorry you are struggling. It’s never any fun and it’s not easy. I know you probably don’t want to hear it but if your struggling you need to get your doctor in the loop. Suffering isn’t good and sometimes you need to adjust things…medications can be hit or miss. You deserve to live a quality life. We all do and sometimes you need to ask for help if it’s needed. Don’t try and do it alone. Is it possible to get with your doctor tomorrow or sooner?

176165512,"Your husband is lucky that you care. The fact that you have torn emotions means that you care and it shows that you are a empathic person. It is a good trait to have. Don’t feel that because you care you are guilty though. It just means that you are a good human being. It is true that we should always think of others, but it comes to a point where you have to take care of yourself, almost like a battery on a cell phone. If your battery is low, you have little to give, and then you need to put yourself first and care for yourself. I don’t think it is right of your husband to try and make you feel guilty. I mean…the same applies to him in that case. He should respect you and give you what you need. Which is time alone at this point. I hope the situation calms down and you get time to heal. Don’t feel guilty because you care."

174384401,"I absolutely disagree with that opinion. I have first hand experience at the mercy of these drugs such as anti depressants, anti anxiety medications, and one AP. The drugs are synthetic and man made. They are not natural. They alter the way the mind works by introducing foreign substances to the body. I do not believe in putting young developing minds on these psychotropic drugs. There is plenty of info on the chemical dependancy of these drugs. Many first hand experiences of them can be found by doing just a quick google. Search. Hell, some people end up killing themselves because of these bastardized drugs. The first anti depressant I ever tried made me suicidal when I had never once been suicidal ever before in my life. Just cause you went to med school doesn’t mean you know how these drugs affect the human psyche. Oh, and by the way, the way these drugs work in the brain is still not fully understood. There’s more complexities to the human mind than we fully understand. Drug companies are p

174384406,"So do they still take antipsychotics? It would be great if we could measure this propensity for psychosis in some way, because it’s not healthy taking the drugs (from all of my reading)."
176165554,It’s something like $45.00. No Medicare won’t cover it. It’s really a hassle right now going to the doctor with Covid19. I’m trying to avoid it.
174384404,"I was first diagnosed with “Psychosis NOS” after my initial stay at the hospital. Fell through the cracks after that for several years-- no meds, and no support from a therapist or pdoc. Found my way back into a partial hospitalization program, and that’s when they told me I have SZA and started me on Abilify. I honestly didn’t fight the diagnosis-- I’d spent years running from it and was tired of trying to find answers from unreputable sources, one of them being a “shaman”. There are days where I feel like the past 10-ish years were a fluke. Then there’s days where I know for sure I’ve got an illness."
176165555,I take 25 mg of clozapine to help me fall asleep. It helps but I sleep very long though.

176165562,The trigger happened 18 years ago when i was talking to a friend over a chat program and loads of people seemed to be listening in on the conversation and i had a massive argument with them and they were threatening my life. I’ve mentioned it to my therapist years ago and she reckons they were trying to get a rise out of me. My mum and friend think it was all a hallucination but I’m convinced it was real.
176165563,Yeah. I forgot about her.
176165564,I would be completely lost without risperidone
176165565,"No…I’m not sure why I would. It’s just an episode, no psychosis. I have insurance that covers my visits."
176165566,Hmmm that sounds like a good idea. Now I just have to pick a treat. Maybe I’ll have my son bring home some cookies when he comes. Chocolate chip cookies and milk sound good.
176165567,I think recovery is possible at any stage how unlikely it May seem. I have been on meds for 7 years. Had some ups and downs but never fully recovered. I just had a set back and had to up my medication.
176165568,"no, he’s not forcing or hitting me, I’m totally in love"
176165569,Buspar is a good option. I take 600mg a day and it helps me.
176165570,Same here. My boyfriend and I are debating my diagnosis and I saw a forensic psychologist who thinks I’m fine Because I did not disclose symptoms. Now I wonder whether I am schizoaffective and whether my delusions are real. That would mean a few hundred people died and were replaced by clones. What are the odds of that? Anyhow I think it’s real and it is distressing. Does anyone think this is real? People here will probably say no.

176165579,"Some of that in your 1st, 2nd and 3rd post rings true to me. When people are quiet around me it’s definitely that there’s a narrative about me. When I have hurt feelings, no one has suffered more than me and there’s got to be payback. And I’m the most petulant, selfish moron in the world moreso than our current president."
176165580,"Everything made sense. I was at peace…an inner peace with the Universe. When I walked down the street, lamp posts would flicker…fire hydrants would go off…the trees would bow down to me…the leaves all waved hello…every blade of grass pointed at me as I passed. The whole world was alive when I was psychotic. No drug has ever gotten me that high before. My brain was lit. I miss the colour and the creativity and the fantastical voyage I embarked upon."
176165581,"I have had side effects. I also can’t jog on Geodon because my heart rate goes through the roof. Used to be an avid runner and quite skinny. Geodon kept me skinny but I couldn’t run anymore but I added Latuda and put on 50 pounds. I don’t feel fat though so I am not worried about it. I don’t think Latuda helps much for my psychotic symptoms but it helps with negatives. Side effects from Geodon are tremors in my hands but two Benedryl a day knocks those out. Also syncope and collapse or fainting if I try to get up and get out of bed too fast. I lye in bed a few minutes before I try to get up. The first time this happened I put a hole in the wall of my bathroom with my head when I fell out. I had it a few times. Haven’t had it all lately. And then with Geodon there is also mild erectile dysfunction which is a symptom no man wants to have but I do get Viagra. The side effects are all manageable and without the meds I get terrifying hallucinations and suicidal ideation and then there is psych
osis on top of that which makes me lose my memory. Not a good combination and it lands me in a hospital. When people talk about psychosis you usually hear about paranoia, delusions and hallucinations but it’s so much more than just that. If you have psychosis you really need your meds."

176165584,"Unfortunately for my mental health, I sort of have answers for all of those questions. But bear in mind that my solipsism is not very strict, it combines features of solipsism proper with occasionalism. _PERSON_’s works, for example, would have been written, or at least co-written, by the demiurge."
176165585,Maybe not. A famous therapist used to go up to random woman and ask them out in order to get over fear of rejection. I think he prescribed the same to patients with social anxieties. I don’t know if rejection will ever feel good or even ok but maybe more tolerable? Like I would just get used to contacting people and not getting a reply because that’s the nature of online dating? I don’t know. I haven’t really tried it out myself. I downloaded Bumble but am too anxious to actually do the swiping thing. And I also have hang ups about actually meeting someone too – with my mental health how will it all work out?

Go to them and forgive them for how they effected your life."
176165602,"It’s a combination of external factors and your brain chemistry. Like a loop, data comes in gets processed, you become aware of it, and then it goes back in. There can be problems on either side of this loop: either with the processing or with the stimulus. I lean more to the idea that the processing side is more the culprit for how you feel. Different people can react differently to the same situation because they process it differently. Meds can change the way you process things and ADs help to do this."

174384418,"[ The British Journal of Psychiatry, ] [Volume 217] Issue 5 November 2020 , p. 653 Sarcosine in the management of schizophreniaI read with interest the editorial in December 2019 on‘Apossible role for sarcosine in the management of schizophrenia’. Professor _PERSON_ did suggest that‘it seems to be universally well toleratedwith an absence of significant side-effects’.1I wonder if addition of sarcosine to medication for schizophrenia is actually safe for every patient. It is well accepted that sarcosine level increases in manycases of carcinoma of the prostate gland. Indeed, it may well be amarker for carcinoma of the prostate.2–4It is thought that this ele-vated level of sarcosine is produced by the prostatic cancer cells.This does not mean that it causes the cancer. However, there are atleast two important studies in the literature that comment on thisissue. _PERSON_ 2009 found metabolomic profiles delineating a potential role for sarcosine in prostatic cancer progres-sion and _PERSON_ e
t al6inNeoplasiain 2013 found increased alteration of benign prostatic epithelial cells upon the addition of sarcosine toprostatic cells. I wondered therefore if a note of caution should besounded about the use of sarcosine supplement in older men withschizophrenia, especially those with signs of prostatic hypertrophy.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males over 70 andthe second most common cause of cancer deaths in men. _NAME_, Bsc MBBch FRCPsych, Retired Consultant Psychiatrist Author’s reply Dr _NAME_ is quite right to draw attention to the theoretical possi-bility that sarcosine might have unrecognised side-effects along the lines he draws attention to. However, it is worth stating that there is no empirical evidence at all that sarcosine does in fact increase risk of prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma. This possibility could be investigated using animal studies and in the context of properly resourced, large-scale clinical trials. As sarcosine cannot be patented, these would have to be funde
d by research councils or charitable bodies since no pharmaceutical company is likely to be interested. At present, the evidence strongly suggests that sarcosine is effective in at least some patients with schizophrenia and is well tolerated and probably safe. _NAME_, Honorary Professor, University College London, UK."

174384425,"One or more of these four genes or their pseudogenes (RPL7, RPL23, RPS27, KRT) flanks almost all deletion regions that cause schizopnrenia as a comorbidity e.g. 22q11, and three out of four major Parkinson’s disease genes - Parkinson’s disease causes psychosis. In addition, a check against a gene panel for inborn errors of metabolism that cause schizopnrenia as a comorbidity shows that one or more of these four genes flank about a third of these causative genes. Two of these genes - an RPL7 and and no less than three RPL23 genes - flank EGLN3. KRT9 is a top four disfunctional gene in EGLN3 silencing, whilst TPM1 is the top disfunctional gene. TPM genes are found right next to RPS27 genes at several locations. I already posted that the major schizopnrenia gene DISC1 flanks EGLN1, whilst NPAS3, which is a gene where a mutation segregates with familial schizopnrenia, flanks EGLN3. So a very reasonable hypothesis would be that deletions/mutations impact on the function of one or more flanking RPL7, 
RPL23, RPS27 or KRT genes, which in turn impact on RPL7 and/or RPL23 flanking EGLN3 or the EGLN3 gene targets TPM1 and KRT9. This then alters EGLN3/EGLN1 function and causes an altered hypoxic response and the symptoms of schizopnrenia. This should be proven or disproven as a hypothesis ASAP, at least in my lay person’s opinion."

176165669,Also I forgot to mention one of my distant aunties commited suicide and was in an asylum back in the olden times and my dads cousin I believe has schizophrenia I dont think he was diagnosed.no one closely related to me. My mums cousin also has issues but I’m not entirely sure what they are. Could be anything
176165670,Wait. Does Klingon count?
176165671,"Are you talking about the disability review? That’s where they determine if you are still disabled. I don’t think they check to see what you’re spending your money on. They check to see what doctor appointments you have, what your diagnosis is, what medications and treatment you receive and what your prognosis is. They also check for hospitalizations. Then they determine if you are still disabled."
176165672,I’m interested in earning a living wage. I can compromise on that.
176165673,Scary picture. Where’s it from
176165674,I took 3mg today in divided doses. I’ll try 2mg tomorrow to see if it makes any difference
176165675,I usually get started alright but I lose motivation after a period of time. I had someone tell me that it was the honeymoon phase. I do good for a while and then splat nothing anymore and I revert back to my old ways.
176165676,"I quit smoking pot and drinking alcohol, both of which I have an addiction to. I ate healthy for 2 days in a row, but then I binged ate yesterday. I have trouble with impulse control."
176165677,"I didnt have concentration to read all posts, so i might say things others did too. I struggled for years, with more hospitalisations than you, and even the nurses shocked by the severity of my psychoses. Even my doctors gave up on me - they said i would die soon. I wanted euthanasia. Now life is still tougher than average, but worth it. Besides trouble, i have happy moods and good people and fun activities and laughs and a job (though i might quit that). I do not want to die. I wasnt hospitalised for years. Dont give up hope! Life can change, one step at the time. Hang on! Is there a goal you could cling to? A person you like, an activity, a wish?"
176165678,I couldn’t say. For me is not the sort of supplement I take regularly so the concept of a dose might hard to quantify. But an ounce of CBD bud is around £180. Depends on how much you use
176165679,Yes I think it might be bipolar and psychosis with autism as I have family history
176165680,"That Too, Promise. But I Got to Get Back on My Guitar. It’s Been Waiting For ‘Two Weeks’!."
176165681,"I used to take it once a day with no problems. When I lost weight, I split it into two doses to metabolize it easier. But I had no problems taking it once a day back when I did. Everyone is different though. Geodon is really tough to get with no insurance though. $120 is actually super cheap. When I had no insurance, I had to pay $350 for a bottle once."
176165682,"I was once told at recovery college, in order to feel more comfortable around a person try to find something in common in order to build a connection. For example, she was at an interview, and the interviewer had the same flask for tea that she uses and that helped her feel connected, no matter how small the thing in common is. Like a tea flask. Hehe."
176165683,"I’m kind of scared of men too. Not comfortable around them so much, in person. Kind of an upringing flaw. I mean I had a few in person male friends, but like big intimidating men are hard to feel comfortable around. Inferiority complex or something. I used to be fine with this pre-SZ."

176165686,Oh wow… I’m so sorry that you suffer from pain also. It’s so unpleasant. How is tramadol helping you so far? I’m on gabapentin (not sure the dosage) and some muscle relaxant. How do you manage your fibromyalgia flares? I just find it so hard when pain hits me. Sending love!
176165687,No none of that “garbage” is prolactin. I’d ask them to test for it again. My pdoc did this to me once too.
174384440,"Hi and welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_! If you find yourself needing help for any reason, please call on a mod. Just type the @ symbol followed by our name without a space. Here are the active mods- myself _AT_MENTION_, _AT_MENTION_, _AT_MENTION_, _AT_MENTION_, and _AT_MENTION_ As for your questions, to be honest it really sounds like you need a med adjustment. You need to be open and honest with your therapist and pdoc. None of what you describe is normal or even possible. Your brain is sick and schizophrenia makes us susceptible to delusional thoughts like yours. These people that do the Otherkin thing are either mentally ill, pretending for fun like role-playing, or pretending for attention. Some are pretending to meet vulnerable people to take advantage of. And many are just seeking an escape from reality and need friends. I hope that you enjoy your time on the forum. It can be a lot of fun here."

176165690,No. None. They know that people can parent on this. Unless someone reports you. Just be careful what you say. If you lose patience with your kid tell them you are noticing an increase in aggression rather than that you yelled at your kid. Don’t lie but don’t put all your truth out there. Psych doctors know when a person is genuinely trying to be better. No one would take your baby away for that unless you are a threat and you find yourself potentially becoming a threat to his safety if you don’t get help

174384445,"Yeah. I’m terrified of losing it again. She said she’ll add on the Vraylar for about 6 months before changing the perphenazine. Make sure I react well to it. I’m still a little scared that it’ll make me crazy, though. That maybe I’ll mess up how well I’m responding to the perphenazine. I’m kind if out of options for meds. It’s Vraylar and clozapine. Everything else has been tried or isn’t available to me. So I’m really really nervous about messing up a good thing."

176165700,I think I’m actually less odd when psychotic.
176165701,"There are many reasons for bullying, but generally I would say that the people doing it probably aren’t mature or smart enough to understand jealousy. Hateful people exist. I was beaten pillar to post at school. It got really bad, but I can assure you that once you become an adult, and are not forced into schooling, you will thrive"

176165705,"Canada has tons of guns too but they don’t have the soaring gun death statistics that we do (the USA). In VA every time I had a hearing at a mental hospital they said if I was found mentally unwell and committed that I’d lose my right to purchase a gun in that state. So I can’t buy them in VA, but I can in California as far as I’m aware. I would never buy one, too much chance I’ll use it on myself."
176165706,I think about stopping meds often. It will be a happy and painless death as I dont feel pain when in psychosis. Either kill myself or kill someone and be shot by cops.
174384444,I take mine at bedtime
176165707,I usually have 3 cups of coffee every morning. Then I have coffee and tea in the afternoon.
176165708,"Yes I agree with this. I’m learning to decontaminate my mind. Since I joined this forum, I’ve made it quite far. It’s been a journey. I just have to keep telling myself in various ways that I have a mental illness rather than the things I think like that I’m a terrorist."
176165709,"You need to tell him that you don’t think he’s acting okay and you’re worried about him. Ask if he’s been taking his meds, ask if he thinks it’d be a good idea to check in with a psychiatrist and have a review. Tell him you think it would be a good idea no matter how he responds."
176165710,Thank you. _PHONE_NO_
176165711,"Have you ever been eating and hallucinated you were eating something else? Like did your food taste off? I think I had that today. I was eating eggs and beans, not expired, and they tasted like rotten meat. Then I ate a sandwich for lunch and that tasted like rotten meat, and now I’m drinking coffee and it tastes like rotten meat. I have good oral hygiene. I brush my teeth twice a day, and floss."
176165712,How come you think that? Do you hear or see things in your head?
176165713,This reminds me of trivial knowledge I came across once about the phrase: ‘Pull yourself up by the bootstraps’. It’s a physical impossibility. But that all too often is the tack(sp) that neurotypicals take with us.
176165714,I’m on the highest dose of inVega and it’s the shot to because I can’t remember to take a pill everyday. It works great for me. I have no motivation though. Just give it a chance it might work wonders like it doesr me

176165718,Section 8 housing was shut down. My recertifiction and new vouchers will be delayed.
176165719,"It’s not about the money. If you’re lucky enough, you get the right amount of support if you ever find yourself in difficulty, the UK State will help you. Monetising the support we get is not the right thing to do. What we should be asking for is the right treatment, and that’s all."

176165721,"It’s not about their attitude. They are doing something, I really don’t want to talk about, that is making me too sick to do anything. When I was homeless, or when I first moved in, I wasn’t sick and having trouble doing things."

176165723,"Listen to music with headphones. Keep your mind busy with hobbies. Don’t isolate yourself. De stress as much as possible. There is a difference with thoughts and urges. If you begin to feel urges, seek medical help immediately."
176165724,I’ve been on 1 mg only but before that I was on higher.
176165725,My sister and brother in law were keeping guns away from my four year old nephew. When he started nibbling his crackers into the shape of a gun they decided maybe he would be less obsessed with guns if they let him play with them.
176165726,I think it can it can put a lot of stress on family members of the person who lacks insight.

It’s taking everything I have not to break down sobbing constantly."
176165730,I decided not to get the dog washing franchise. They wanted me to pay $1200 to get my credit fixed. I am looking at another franchise right now. It’s delivering fresh pet food so still in the pet industry. Sounds easier than washing dogs and it’s a little cheaper and I already own two SUVs so I don’t think I would have to get another vehicle. They want you to put a wrap around it though.
176165731,188 x ~220= roughly how many words your books is. Because standard books have about 200-250 words per page.

176165735,"The only thing I’m consistent with is hygiene, though my skin has been a mess lately so I guess I need to up my efforts in caring for it. Aside from that, my room is a wreck, I can’t commit to anything important, I spend way too much time on internet games, and I’m keeping several other comforting but bad habits around that I had every intention of breaking before I realized I really have no other coping mechanisms that I can implement with ease. I feel like my only hope right now is intensive therapy. Could you try that? Sorry you’re struggling too."
176165736,"I’m pretty sure the reason why you reacted to the sedation is because you are probably just stressed and depressed. If I were you I would just stick it out, and I think it will get better."

After in and out of psych wards and rehabs for six times I finally understood that I need meds for my health in 2019 since then till now I am doing great health wise. The main problem in my life is I am dependent on my parents, who are old. I don’t have a job. We are financially in a good place but my guilt of not being able to earn my own living remains. I cannot put my concentration on anything for a long time. To go to a job seems like a big thing to me… I feel too nervous and anxious about how I can handle such things. No motivation at all as well. I leave a task mid way even simple ones. So how to differentiate between laziness and negatives?"
176165748,Also has antipsychotic medication made then nicer people Rather than always being mad or thinking the worst of people? Did antipsychotics stop your aggression and treating people negatively?

176165752,You can absolutely effect your anger by controlling your thoughts. That’s precisely what you’re supposed to be doing. It part of maturing. Good for you. Many people let their emotions run rampant.
176165753,I could write a book on the stuff I saw and did. It’s been 20 years since I was a hardcore drug addict and did this stuff. Every day I wake up thankful I’m not dead or in prison. I saw more stuff then most people have in 10 lifetimes. I walk a straight line now a days.
176165754,It’s a break from reality. From the outside world.
174384450,I’ve always felt like there was some alien or government group that was always following me and also somehow through advanced technology was not only able to watch me but at times hear my thoughts and be able to place people into my life to interact with me in a way that was able to manipulate me into doing what it was that they has planned for me. Like my entire life was some genetic experiment that is constantly being logged and tested. My family moved a lot when I was younger especially me making it even worse believing that my parents were trying to keep me hidden from something or someone. There have been times when I swore I could feel all the pain of the world and it would completely debilitate me. Also I’ve always felt that I was able to feel other people’s emotions even project my own and at times read minds although im not sure if it was just assessing physical and physiological ques but I was always correct much more often than not. I was very suicidal for a while even tried substan
tially a couple times but ended up just believing that there was some “group” trying to manipulate my life and get me to do it while another group was fighting back all with psychic powers. I think I’m definitely going to get checked and maybe even tell the truth if I can find someone I feel I can trust when I’m able to get it done after the holidays.
176165755,That’s a lot of coffee. I’d cut back. Probably not. What dose of Abilify pills are you taking each day?
176165756,I wanted to share this positive experience. Anyone battled this illness hard and recovered eventually?
176165757,ANGELS. (And no i cant stand the _NAME_ song - its been played to death)
176165758,Sorry you are having a bad day _AT_MENTION_ . I don’t think that’s true though…you have your own personality. I’ve seen it here on the forum.
176165759,facts are good if you dream on getting into political discussions on the news. if you would rather have a conversation with me just make up whimsical bs. haha
176165760,Sorry I was replying to butterflyy.
176165761,"I’ve been working on a personal project for the past 3 months, 10 hours a day. I’m hoping that it will turn into a fully fledged business. I’ve been doing it on/off for the past two years, but I recently added coffee to my routine, and it seems the extra stimulus is really helping for me. I’m probably close to psychosis, but I don’t care - I NEED TO WORK."
176165762,"One problem would be that if you are mentally ill, for some people, are they capable of making a good decision about ending their lives? If legal suicide was available, I could see people having a bad week or a bad year and just think checking out seems like the only solution. When in reality, many people do recover to some degree. I mean when I was first ill I suffered a lot and was suicidal many, many times. My life seemed hopeless and I had nothing and I was in a house for schizophrenics. I spent a year there sleeping on an old dirty mattress on the floor in a tiny room. Maybe, if assisted suicide was legal back then I might have chose to end my life at age 19. But I got better. I spent another 8 months in the hospital suffering. But I got better. And ended up getting a job and going to school. And living a life. I mean when you’re in the middle of suffering and you see no light at the end of the tunnel are you really going to make a good informed decision?"
176165763,Will look out for it when it comes out over here.
176165764,"hey _AT_MENTION_, I’m here, just chilling out. Need to go to bed at a reasonable hour (in a couple of hours) as I have a work shift tomorrow morning. How are you?"
176165765,Consistently picking winning lottery numbers.
174384452,Could you try writing a letter? Maybe ask your doctor for some tips on what to say?
176165766,"Maybe see if you can find alternative, suitable things to do. For instance, I started off with recovery college, which was open even during covid, since it’s health and education, and then now I’m doing personal journaling. And maybe a hobby?if you feel like it… I hope you find something to do that will help your mental recovery, and keep stress to a minimum. Idk if job is right for you right now, unless you feel adamant that it is, like discussed it with a therapist or something like that too."
176165767,I participated in a research study recently that evaluated risk decision making in people with sz/sza. Part of it was a lot of psychological testing and then they stuck me in an MRI for an hour while i played gambling games. It was kind of fun but very uncomfortable.

176165768,"Yeah, Standard Time causes depression in some people, so many that it’s called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). I had it so bad that I moved 1,300 miles south, but I realize that most people cannot do that for various reasons. I like to be outside as much as possible; even if it’s cloudy there’s still sunlight. I also take vitamin D3."
176165769,I live in Texas and see Mexicans everyday. They deserve more recognition for all they contribute to society I think.
176165770,What’s making you think about not getting it?
176165771,"Personally, I lost a lot. I lost someone I loved-- granted if they really loved me they’d still be here, probably. He did a lot for me and helped me out during our 5.5 year relationship, but I guess when my symptoms got worse he couldn’t handle it anymore. More importantly, you can lose yourself. It’s been a struggle to regain aspects of my personality, like sense of humor and social skills. Getting there day by day, though. This illness takes a lot, but also shows you what’s truly important sometimes."
176165772,Maybe the solution to better psychiatric treatment is to optimize the performance of someone cognitive abilities while he is on antipsychotics and to change dosages while he is performing cognitive tasks depending on how good he performs. I think that 70 years since antipsychotics are on the market is why we need to ask for better treatment and our right to continue college and have a proper education

176165784,"I saw a documentary about psychiatry and the main thing they talked about was how they get people to re-integrate into the community. This is not a reality I know. In my hometown I only have my parents and step sister and that’s it. Where ever I go people don’t talk to me, and I have no friends. All I seem to do is work and sleep. I have no life. I am rejected by my community, and I feel so isolated and alone. There has been no effort from the community mental health team to ‘re-integrate’ me with other people. I feel completely lost and like I have just been kicked out of hospital institutions without the tools to know how to relate and make friends with new people. It seems like a closed door. I have no desire really to integrate, as I feel after all these years I have been sidelined because of my behaviour and my past. All I am asking is to feel part of my hometowns community, but this seems to be too much to ask. whilst I sit here, time is flying by and the quality of life argument make
s no sense. I am not materialistic. I do have some nice things, but I do not measure quality of life by what you own, it’s the personal bonds with locals that means a lot and having a proper support structure of people who know you who you can do things with.

176165791,Lately I’ve been feeling like I’ve reached the end of the road so to speak… losing hope. I feel like my energy level and motivation is not at a place capable of striving anymore. The idea of death and resting and peace is really comfortable to me currently. My soul is feeling like it’s tired of my body. Can anybody relate to this feeling?

176165798,"I would say the most important thing to do when you want to feel more grateful for what you have is to enjoy what you have. Make a list of things that you like about what you have and read it once before bed. Joyous happy thoughts about what you have in life are a lot better as a last thought for the day instead of your last thought being an “I wish” or “should have” type of thoughts. You have a boyfriend, right? Make a list of all the things you like about him and read it before you go to sleep. A significant other is just one example. It could be a list of hobbies, pets, family, or all of the above."

I am woozy and drunkenness feeling since 2014, it’s a long story but basically I started to feel unwell with headaches and dizziness plus falling to my right side and unbalanced back in 2014. My head felt full and woozy so I have this issue from long ago. The zombie like feeling I have since ever taking the new meds I am on. I should have clarified better. I’m on 300mg of lyrica now. I think I have a neurological problem but none of the neurologists I saw think that is the case. They think its psychological which is why I was referred to a psychiatrist. I have somataform disorder, anxiety and depression so am being treated for that. The groggy woozy head is always there no matter what which is why I think it’s a rare neurological condition perhaps. Am on the waiting list to see another neurologist so I see how that goes. Hugs"

176165825,"I can definitely understand feeling hurt and upset. Those feelings are very valid. For now, especially while those feelings are quite raw, perhaps you might focus on providing yourself with a comfortable safe environment? There have been times in my life when I have been terribly hurt by other people. Initially, I become completely overwhelmed by feelings of hurt, grief, self-doubt, despair and even anger. I have found though, that it’s OK to curl up in a protective ball for a while and just feel the emotions. Then when I’m ready, I find that I’m better able to process the emotions, learn something from the experience, and move on.

176165829,"Psychology Today Chronic Schizophrenia Put Into Remission Without Medication New research suggests ketogenic diet may play a role in treating schizophrenia. "" An 82-year-old woman with chronic paranoid schizophrenia since age 17 The first patient documented in the Schizophrenia Research article is a woman who spent nearly her whole life suffering chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia. For more than 50 years, she endured paranoia, disorganized speech, visual and auditory hallucinations. By the time she was 70, she was suicidal and had been hospitalized repeatedly for psychosis or suicide attempts. She had been treated with over ten different antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medications, including regular antipsychotic injections. None of them helped her symptoms. She was unable to care for herself and had a court-appointed guardian and home health services. At the age of 70, weighing 330 pounds, she went to a medical weight loss clinic and was started on a ketogenic diet. Within two weeks of 
starting the diet, she reported a noticeable reduction not only in her weight but also her psychotic symptoms. Within several months, she started to feel so much better that she was able to stop taking her psychiatric medications while remaining on the diet. Over time, her mood stabilized, and her hallucinations and paranoia remitted completely. She was no longer suicidal. Her case was first reported in 2009. Today, 12 years later, she has lost a total of 150 pounds and remains on the ketogenic diet. She takes no medications and remains symptom-free. She was able to regain her independence, no longer requiring the guardian and the home health care team. When I recently spoke with her, she recalled her decades of suffering and hopelessness, and said that since starting the diet, she has had a “new life,” and is happy to be alive."""

176165832,"This is why I’m debating on telling my team about having psychosis. If it is truly HSP and if it is an organic brain disease, I may have to stop taking antipsychotics. But research papers say that it is ok to prescribe APs for HSP. So I’m just thinking taking APs won’t harm me much."

176165835,Even scientists are debating whether we are living in a simulation or not. The math behind it would have to be extremely complicated. And the “real” world running this simulation would be totally incomprehensible to our minds. So why bother with things beyond our understanding? To keep it short. Schizophrenia comes with a feeling of derealization. It’s just a brain disorder. Just remember how you used to feel before the illness. That’s where you should fight to be once again.

What I found funny is that my wife is a bit more … timorous … then me when it comes to all things sex, so I wound up being the one who had The Talk with my daughter. Mom asked the kid later how I did and the kid gave me high marks, but, my wife wasn’t completely impressed with my instruction. “YOU CALLED HER PERIOD SHARK WEEK?!?” “It seemed appropriate and she agreed.” “OMFG.”"

It’s been 4 years since I got pneumonia and had to go on oxygen. I’m finally motivated to work my way off it."
176165855,Age is just a number. I respect people’s age but I notice wisdom has not always kept up with it. Some aged folk still behave like spoiled children: selfish and mindless. But I think sz makes us very wise. Suffering opens our eyes in a way no other worldly experience ever could.

I told my doctor straight up that I was having trouble ejaculating, it was awkward sure, but it had to be done. Now as far as dick size goes, I think thats someway of something that will come back, I’m a grower, I get bigger when erect, when I was having the erectile problems I couldn’t get as big as I used to, but after a while I began regaining function and motivation, part of it was I wasn’t getting stimulated enough and part of it was I wasn’t reacting when I was stimulated. I still have a lowered sex drive, but thats something I can’t help, what I can do is when I eventually do get in the mood, is notice if I’m having trouble, is me in my head like not enjoying the particular porn on display that day, and its putting me off, or is it me in my head not getting the correct response to stimuli that I get normally when I view stuff.

176165878,"I’ve always admired people with math brains. I used to be good at maths, I’d solve it in my head. But in 5-7th grade I had a really mean teacher who kept failing me for not showing my work, not using her methods even though the answers were right, or writing the numbers too sloppy. She’d give us assignment sheets every two weeks and punish those who didn’r finish them. You’d think she at least praised the ones who did finish. Nope. Another sheet and punishment for not finishing that too. She killed every interest I had in spending my brain power on math. I lost the ability to understand most math aspects aside from what’s needed to make a budget and pay taxes. Then there’s people like my cousin who are just naturally interested in maths and seem to grasp it easily."

176165890,"Thanks for your post _AT_MENTION_ I am just a bit fatigued from my employment situation, med changes and other people just treating me really badly - with heightened stress and anxiety. One thing I am grateful for is that my AP controls my psychosis symptoms. That’s at a cost of three times higher prolactin levels. But the benefits out weigh the risks according to the doctors that _AT_MENTION_ made the point only speak to you for 15 mins a month at best. My med changes recently have been to try and treat anxiety, and I have been on Benzos for another year again, which makes life more complicated with withdrawal.

176165891,"Well, there was a point in time when I was younger, like in my thirties when I tried to help people. I mean I still help people when I can but I can’t jump into peoples problems or deep into peoples lives anymore. I’m too old and don’t like big changes anymore. If the guy doesn’t want help than that’s his choice. I tried to help fellow addicts or alcoholics when I was really immersed in the program. It can be a very thankless endeavor and to see someone keep making mistake after mistake and keep drinking is frustrating. AA is what helps people. You can’t make him stop drinking if he doesn’t want to stop drinking. It’s nice of you to want to help but you’re taking on a pretty big project. And I don’t mean to be snobbish but maybe you can find better friends. And after just 4 days it’s not really a deep friendship. I guess I’m looking at it through my own perspective. I am satisfied with a calm, drama free life (for the most part). I would try to help someone but I don’t nee

This leads to the ‘Bayesian coding hypothesis’: that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is 
almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty."

I have noticed when I’m anxious, I tend to have worse psychotic symptoms, which in turn make me more anxious. It’s a vicious cycle."

176165950,"That’s messed up. Sorry. Well here are some tricks I have Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

176165954,"Hey guy’s sorry for the delay. The results where very modest at best. I experienced what seemed like small improvements in working memory. At times i felt like memories of things i had just done lingered in there accessibility for just a bit longer. For example while showering ill forget if i’ve i just shampooed my hair of washed by face. It seemed like i could remember weather or not i had just done things like that more often. Those improvements were also possibly just the result of paying closer attention while trying this combination. However, i was taking 100mg of the minocycline. Thats what i remembered the patients in the study taking. I was also taking 2g of the NAC. Also the amount i remember from the study. The prescription actually called for 200mgs of the minocycline. 1 pill twice a day. I do remember having better results on 200mgs but it was a one and done prescription and i ran out. I do not remember any improvements in quality of life from this. All of this is obviously entirely 
subjective and anecdotal and shouldn’t discourage you if your excited about this one. On the brighter side, for me at least, sulforaphane has been a big success."

176165965,It comes and goes and is worse sometimes then others. I had it bad when I was 19 before I was schizophrenic. Was in a state of panic driving or going in stores. What was worse is that I was sharing an apartment with my sister and to get to my apartment door I had to walk down an aisle and all the other tenants doors faced the aisle. So I was going through a phase where I didn’t want to be looked at but every day I had to walk down that walkway and I felt everybody was staring at me. I guess actually that was an early sign that something was drastically wrong.

176165985,I have tried very low calorie diets where I was only consuming 600-700 calories daily under the supervision of a doctor and the weight didn’t budge.
176165986,"It depends on your reaction to the AP and how much the dose is. Some of us don’t get a choice which AP we are forced to take. I eat less than 1600 calories a day, which isn’t a lot of food for a man, but am just managing to maintain weight at around 76.5kg. The AP I take limits exercise as it gives me leg cramps when I walk over 2km. I used to think weight gain was associated with a bad diet, but living on this limited diet proves to me that it is mostly the APs that cause weight gain. I don’t eat cakes, biscuits, crisps, deep fried food or sweets and haven’t for years and still I managed to put on weight. If you get lucky with an AP that works for you and doesn’t cause weight gain, then the stars are aligned for you. If not, weight gain is mostly inevitable."

176165998,"Hi all so just need help rationalizing something else I went through. On my way home from Dublin in the car, I start to hear the faint voice of _NAME_ saying ‘are you a mindreader?’ Are you a mindreader? ‘Can you hear me?’ For anyone that doesn’t know _NAME_ is a guy I used to work with (also in the _NAME_). I only hear his voice at home and I went to Dublin to escape it. The gist of what my voices put me through is that they told me I am a freak because I can hear them and they accuse me of being some sort of mindreader. I believed I was in a lot of trouble for it. So anyway, I’m in the car and I can kinda hear his voice. So instantly I think, he must be in one of the cars in front of me or behind me, that was my rational at the time he must be close is what I’m saying. So I think oh s h i t I can hear his voice I must be a mindreader (_USER_ID_; I’m not worried about being a mindreader I know now they were only doing it to trick me) But here’s the f’d up part. I then pull off 
the motorway into this little village and I’m turning around the car in a parking lot and who do I see but _NAME_ driving by me and he was staring at me. I heard his voice claiming I’m a mindreader and then I see him giving me looks, how do I rationalize that?? I think he was following behind me and seen I pulled in I’m conscious that I started threads similar to this but I can assure you on my family’s lives, it is all true and nothing is fabricated and I didn’t hallucinate it.

176166032,"I don’t hear voices. I’ve wondered about the same thing but the other way around. How do people who hear voices relate to those with paranoia and delusions? I get ideas of reference and various delusions,delusions of reference, delusions of grandeur etc. Paranoia can really get out of hand. I’ve made a spectacle of myself so many times. I’m so lucky I don’t hear voices as that would’ve scared me more than my delusional paranoia, I think. I guess that in a way we share the same powerlessness against this illness and that in a sense can make me relate. Also the fact that we all use APs to make us better. Do you hear voices whilst in psychosis only, or also when you are doing well?"

176166040,"A man walks into a psychiatrists office. The doctor says, "" I need a little background on your family to see how you guys relate"". The man says, “Well my mom is normal, my dad is fairly normal but my brother is deluded and thinks he’s a chicken”. The doc says in surprise, “Wow, that’s highly unusual. Why didn’t you bring your brother here with you so we could try to cure him? The man says, “Well yes, I would’ve but my family needs the eggs.”"

174384518,"Was on Risperidone. My prolactin went through the roof. My pdoc added Abilify to get it down. Still was too high. Weaned me off Risperidone while slowly increasing Abilify to the therapeutic dose. I didn’t notice much difference. Both worked great but I don’t have Sz, have another psychotic disorder."
176166041,"_AT_MENTION_ , yeah I’d delete all that personal info."
176166042,Ok this doesn’t make sense upon reading. I bought into the media’s portrayal of mi and when I got diagnosed I thought all the bad stuff was me I saw myself as a killer. Id never do such a thing but what if I don’t know.
176166043,Anxiety doesn’t cause paranoia and delusions.
176166044,Thought insertion is when you can sense other people’s thoughts. Like telepathy. And it is not a good experience either. More like pure torture in fact.

176166047,If the meds are benzos taper off of them with a doctor’s help to avoid complications. If there’s a better med for anxiety you could try that. If you can live with anxiety try that.
176166048,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ . May she Rest In Peace
174384519,That’s how I am too. The thing that bothers me that you don’t have is I don’t know if I have schizoaffective. You at least know what your problem is. I don’t know if I really have it. Do you think I have it based off my history? I still likely won’t believe what anyone says. I’m worried that I’m just a bad person.
176166049,I never hallucinated.
176166050,Welcome to the forum! It’s nice to meet you.
176166051,I deal with the county doctors and I would be lucky if a doctor lasts for any longer than six months. If the meds don’t seem to be working after a while with the dose they given me they try something new. The max doses I took was the shots that did nothing for me also.

I have compulsive water drinking problems. Cute about me maybe is that with my extreme ire toward the populous… I have a fantasy about having ‘Polydipsia’ (it’s called), placed as ‘cause of death’ on my death certificate. It’s just because I think it’ll kick up a lot of good questions. ‘ Dead bodies do a lot of talking’ I’ve learned from crime dramas. That’s the sordid truth. From the heart.

176166091,"The first -and only- coming has not taken place yet. No one died on the cross, but the devil would have us believe otherwise. Partly, it is his strategy to turn “mankind” -my proyections- into a guilty god-killer, thus enacting his darkest desire. The death of the Jesus-archetype will bring an end to this make-believe universe prompting my return to the Pleroma. About the Bible, like the universe it is a co-creation, both mine and the devil’s. A dialogue if you will. The universe itself can be understood as “desert talk”, two guys, distant relatives, sharing a night fire. Bear in mind that only part of me believes this. Double book-keeping (and therefore psychotic) or merely a thought-experiment gone awry? But then again this is the language of Man."

I’m not sz, but I feel responsible for events like that. As a mentally ill person, I feel like I should be held responsible and I get hurt when people say mean stuff. That’s all I could think about when I see people, and I assume that they’re the same people hating people like us on the Internet. I used to be more accepting of differences but since so many of these events resulted in large uproar, I’m honestly so scared to even meet people because I’m pretty much sure people are going to spread rumours and/or reject me.

Walking down a hallway and taking a bow to the camera, before disappearing, shocking sound of a blast, fade to black, credits roll.

I don’t know how long I’ll be able to keep going but so far things have stabilized a lot and I’m saving a lot of money because I still live with my parents. I help them financially but I’m planning to retire by 40 or at least that’s the goal. I’ll keep pushing as long as I can.

176166155,"_PERSON_’s are good to hug. Do you need one? Keeping up a good fight is hard, it takes everything we have, every day, it can be a lot. It’s lonely too, hard to connect to the earthlings when we’ve spent time in space. You shouldn’t have to suffer, none of us should, it seems unfair. We didn’t deserve this. Someday maybe we’ll have more answers, until then it just feels like waiting to die. Least it does sometimes for me.

174384537,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ I remember you. Good to hear it is mostly over. To the rest of you in this thread, I liked hearing your guys’ journeys and where you are at now. As for myself I have been living with schizophrenia for about seven years, since I was 14 years old. I am twenty now. All during my severe refractory course of illness, I lived with either one of my abusive parents. I love them because I forgive them, but do not forget, so I will call a spade a spade when I say abusive. I went through some serious ????. I am also a dual diagnosis patient – comorbid substance use disorder – methamphetamine and opioids! That started several years after my diagnosis of sz, and I used to cope with trauma and painful emotions and experiences from sz, but it only made my illness worse. However, while spending the majority of my life under my parents’ roofs, I forever burned with an undying hope. And now that I am out of their houses, living with my significant other and best friend of 12 years, I am rebu
ilding my life and finally watching the seeds come up from the ground, set into motion so to speak. Now, because of a multitude of other factors (much of it being with the man I love in a supportive and stable environment) I am circling around a real, profound, and complete recovery. I have literally never been able to say this before, ever, but now I can say without a shard of doubt that I am living a life I want to live. I am content, happy, quietly joyful, whatever you may call it. If I could do the past over again, I would. Because I forgive the past. I now live and love vehemently, with no impasse. Sorry to wax triumphant, but to get to the details, I credit my recovery to a plethora of approaches. One, is the med piece. I got on Vraylar and then got down at just the minimum dose, and Suboxone at a low dose too (an opioid substitution/maintenance treatment to take away cravings & withdrawals / promote long-term abstinence), both in the morning. The Vraylar energizes me for the day, oddly enough, and so d
oes the Suboxone. Vraylar I have found is a miracle antipsychotic for me, probably due to its mechanism of action, which never takes away my symptoms at the expense of my creativity and spirituality. I never thought I would find an antipsychotic that worked for me in that way, and so constantly struggled in my teenage years with med noncompliance. Later, during my addiction, I was incessantly at the whim of whatever ~Pharmakos~ was in my body, and whatever dose of the meds I had adjusted. I was so desperate for anything to change me. But then. . . I let the Universe change me. . . What I mean by that is the psychospiritual aspect of (my) recovery. I was completely unable to get sober from methamphetamine and morphine until I began to attend Dual Recovery Anonymous (first introduced to me in the psychiatric ward), Crystal Meth Anonymous, and Alcoholics Anonymous. I couldn’t just go to the meetings every once in a while, I had to work the Steps. A lot of people don’t know what that means and picture some va
gue objective and tasks-list that bestows sobriety. But the Steps are actually just principles of honest, willing, fearless (psycho)spiritual living that legitimately everyone can benefit from. It goes like this: you admit powerlessness, establish an understanding of a power greater than yourself, surrender to that power, search deep within yourself and confess your wrongs, sickness, and burdensome resentments and fears to that Power (mine is the Universe), to yourself, and to another human being, then willingly ask that Higher Power to remove those troubles, make amends with all who have been hurt by you OR have hurt you, begin to establish conscious contact with the Power through meditation/prayer, then having transformed oneself along spiritual lines, attempt to carry the message to those still suffering and help others in order to “forget yourself” or “step outside” of yourself. All in all, it’s a lot like any mystico-religious tradition, except wholly non-dogmatic / strictly theistic. It’s ju
st a transformative and radically vulnerable way to live. (I also made so many amazing friends from the meetings.) If anyone here also has a drug / alcohol problem, I would highly suggest attending Dual Recovery Anonymous or just Alcoholics Anonymous (welcome to everyone, regardless of substance of choice). Anyway that was a huge piece in my recovery from schizophrenia because it allowed me a way to legitimately strive constantly toward a greater ideal of perfection. Another powerful building block approach to recovery for me was actually psychoanalysis. Sounds crazy, or at least quaint right? Well, actually, psychoanalysis in _NAME_-studied peer-reviewed research shows an incredibly effect size (efficacy) for the treatment of many forms of psychopathology including psychosis / thought disorder. I found CBT/DBT only productive up to a point, which is when I sought analysis to go much deeper, under the covers, into the root of my problems. Because psychoanalysis, if you think about it, is radical. From its mos
t basic theories, it is 100% trauma-informed. A lot of the qualms about psychoanalysis are because of actually wrong misunderstandings and simplifications of its ideas. I love it because, for one, it refuses to be pinned down as either a science, a medicine, or an art. And rightfully so, because the human mind cannot be pinned down strictly in biological terms either! I have been undergoing Lacanian analysis (which has been REALLY affordable for me), which specifically utilizes frameworks for treating psychosis in particular. In the treatment, I have found a “talking cure” that actually validates me, recognizes that my symptoms have meaning (even if it has to be decoded!), that there are real, trauma-based reasons for my psychosis, that human relationships and connection are really our greatest healers, and that I have the authority and agency to direct my own life. And so that is what I am doing. My life right now is looking steeply up! This is not to say that I am not facing deeply sorrowful emotions he
ad on, with no psychostimulant euphoric drugs to just numb/cover it up. I am truly, really living. I am in a totally new town with my best friend / partner (known each other for 12 years, since we were 9!), and I spent this week sending out applications for jobs [I have a guaranteed job at any Starbucks location but am trying to get a job at a nursing home to begin my career in nursing while going to school with the aim of moving up to psychiatric NP!]. I also got health and dental insurance coverage this week AND registered for classes at the community college here! (Rated best in the country…) I will be a Nursing major. My partner and I are planning to get an apartment here. I plan to get a Bachelor’s in Nursing, get a Master’s of Fine Arts in Poetry (I have several legit publications and awards, AND my debut book comes out in 2 WEEKS!), and go on to become a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, work toward post-graduate training and certification in Lacanian psychoanalysis at the San _NAME_ Lacan School C
linic (so that in private practice I can offer meds & therapy), and potentially go on to doctoral degree in neuroscience to do research and teach on neuropsychoanalysis. But yeah anyway that is what my life is looking like right now. I would actually say for the first time ever I am brushing up against total recovery. Thanks all for reading. Best peace, _PERSON_"

I would also add what _AT_MENTION_ said, feeling good mentally. I do all of those things, except I volunteer instead of work, but I am still depressed. I think it is worth a try to go off of your meds WITH A DOCTOR’S GUIDANCE WITH STRONG SUPPORT WITH HONESTY ABOUT YOUR SYMPTOMS WITH A WILLINGNESS TO GO BACK ON Sometimes you have to try just to know! I get that! But the recovery could be due to being on meds, and it’s risky to stop them. The right dosage and combination doesn’t always work if you have to go back on! Hoping the best for you!

174384557,dude you are absolutely in the right for considering requesting your doctor to lower the dose. I feel like my doctor gave me too much wen i was back on invega as well. Then i switched to abilify and i feel like they gave me too much of that too. I feel like they fail to realize people will stop medication all together if its too much; They should do it more gradually and with the persons feelings in mind. voices suck but honestly id rather hear voices then feel like i did on AP’s. My advice would be to stick with meds but reduce them maybe? I was doing okay on abilify then my doctor kept upping and upping and now ive stopped all together

176166242,"I have also experienced this – like I had a near death encounter but by some odd set of circumstances I lived and missed the boat of crossover so now I’m just wondering ''what do I do to bridge the gap when my time comes???"""
176166243,Yes i wasn’t gonna take AD’s lol But doesn’t that apply to AP’s too ”just cause you’re little delusional/hallucinating/paranoid doesn’t mean you have to take antipsychotics”
176166244,Purrito 1515115
176166245,Hope everything turns out ok
176166246,I understand that completely!
176166247,im so scared right now
176166248,Honestly I think you should try it bro!!
176166249,"Man. My gp still won’t give me a sick note, asked on two occasions now. Did you get it from your psychiatrist or the gp? If you don’t mind me asking that is."
174384560,"We dont have that here, only psychiatrists, so idk how it works but tell him/her that you stopped Adderall and that you need to see a psychiatrist. I think I already said it many times but did you try Clozapine?"
176166250,"I don’t think I should look for a new job just yet, only because I plan to move to a different area soon, to be closer to my teaching jobs. I plan to wait until I know where I’m moving to, then look for a side job around there."
176166251,Talk to your psd maybe you’ll get some benzos.
176166252,? was read one medical article that visual hallucinations are significant indicator for higher cognitive deficit.people with visual hallucinations are tend to more catastrophic cognitive deficits than people who not visual hallucinations
176166253,when i read or watching stuffs… these random images like certain part of my school or certain part of mall suddenly popped up in my mind and i cant control it. also i ever heard layered voices(?) in my mind like people talking with words that i dont know when i tried to sleep…
176166254,"Yeah that is about right, but I only ordered 3 drums."
176166255,"Well. Appreciate Your Notion Completely. Gotta Admit, The Quaint Recording’s That Are On There Now, Are Hardly Confident. Not So Much The Video’s Themselves.

176166256,Yup! My primary AP is Abilify 30mg
176166257,"It seems unlikely but if the goal is to make me paranoid and feel unsafe which is the way he works, it is well worth the time to him. That’s his/IRAs whole MO to intimidate and make others feel they are everywhere. As for the surveillance I don’t know what kind he had. I know my phone wasn’t tapped or internet wasn’t being read so that’s why I instantly think he(or his accosiates) has the power to read thoughts or see what I see."
176166258,"As it relates to the disease, what’s the most unbearable symptom you have to deal with? Mine is constant noise from the voices and other auditory bullcrap."
176166259,I have a question. How can adderall be an agonist to TAAR-1 and cause psychosis but sep-363 is also an agonist but has antipsychotic properties?
176166260,"As AA says, “Life shows up.” Meaning you can have your plans or have things going smoothly or what seems like a good relationship and then…you can get sick or be stopped by the police or your pipes burst in the kitchen or your finances go downhill etc. In AA they use it to warn a member if they get too complacent in their recovery. Or to illustrate that just because you get off drugs and you’re doing everything you’re supposed to and things are going great and you expect things to keep going great. And Life shows up…You get fired maybe, a relative dies possibly, etc."
176166261,Think positive and keep trying and your speed will improve

176166264,I have a weird headache with 2-3mg. Took tylenol(acethaminophen) for now and it seems to help
176166265,i think person shouldnt be obsessed about doctor and magical power he has you should correct imbalance in the brain by the medication and that is it plan your life away from doctor being in front of your way
176166266,well id prefer OCD dx to psychosis dx even though its just psychosis NOS
176166267,I suppose. I’ve got _PERSON_ fatigue though.
176166268,Thanks for the heads up. It turns out I can’t get a license in my state. I would need my dr to sign a letter saying my disability was temporary and I’m better now.
176166269,Glad you had a better day _AT_MENTION_.
176166270,"I did a little research, and I found that the form of magnesium that is best tolerated (best absorbed) is magnesium bis-glycinate (un-buffered). There is a brand called CanPrev BisGlycinate Ultra Gentle that seems best. _AT_MENTION_"
176166271,I can draw inanimate objects and paint and stuff but can’t do portraits. Well done you _AT_MENTION_ . I like it. It is a nice representation of you and that takes some talent. Do some more. You’ve nothing to lose and you learn every time you paint/draw or do art! Well done you!
176166272,They said I can take it tonight
176166273,"I wish we all knew that. I wish that we just stop yelling at each other for whoever caused the sickness, and just accept it as it is . I want her to stop rejecting it and stop enforcing it on me. I’m exhausted and I am okay if I die. Death is a normal phase."
174384566,I think your probably right I cant read certain books or watch scary shows/movies anymore. Even the show afflicted on Netflix made me nervous
176166274,"I think its a sign that the vitamins are effective and a little too much coffee. But the de ja vu it feels like…woah I know it all and I have done this before, so what do I need to do differently—like a feeling of fatal dread accompanies it, also prob the mania and caffeine. God help me."
176166275,"Hi, one question… Is safe used togheter?"
176166276,Yeah it’s tough but it’s discipline and it’s hard work. I gained most on risperdal. I have lost on zyprexa because it’s better for my mind but we are all different. You still need to exercise an try even if it’s hard. There’s no easy answers but stopping meds isn’t the best option if you need them. That gets out of whack rather quickly.
176166277,"Is the users page available to you? You can sort by posts or read posts and see which users are most active. In the admin users menu, I can see that most active users have been here for more than 1 year, and a decent amount of them (looks like maybe between 10 and 20%) have been here for 5 years or more (i.e. since this date in 2014). In terms of consistency of overall number of posts, the forum was on a large upward trend until 2018, and has been on a very slight downward trend since this summer."
176166278,"Since you have a new account, would you like us to anonymize your old account _AT_MENTION_?"
176166279,How long have you been on meds? And how old are your children? Eventually you get used to them. Geodon used to make me really tired but it doesn’t anymore. I have to take a sleeping pill to go to sleep so I guess I have the opposite problem now. I never had insomnia before I started taking meds. I always slept like a baby. I have to sleep a lot though. I get about 10 hours a night. If I don’t sleep that much I get psychotic and if I don’t take my sleeping meds I can’t sleep at all.
176166280,I was a hero for a day When I proposed to you And the answer was ‘no’ Now I start from zero (fictional story)
176166281,I’m glad you feel supported here _AT_MENTION_
176166282,"I always see a different one but I am afraid of the dx they’d give me…have a feeling it is bipolar with psychosis or depression because I barely ate or came out of my room for the few days before going into hospital,… made worst by the antidepressant…but still its quite daunting to finally get answers if there are any…plus its made again worse by my lack of memory of what i done."
176166283,My violin teacher used to whack me with the her bow when I played improperly. She was a good teacher though.

176166285,L theanine didn’t work for me. I thought it would be a wonder drug. I took it for 2 weeks and I went into a severely bad episode
176166286,We had 2-3 trolls this week.
176166287,"Usually “I got scratched by a cat” works. Or, “I had a surgery.” Also, it’s none of other people’s business- I hate it when I get asked questions about my scars. So don’t take the remarks of others personally. You could also wear long sleeves, wear bracelets, etc."
176166288,Trust me your average pdoc would have zero clue about the term gaslighting. Being a pdoc is tough on the nerves and when they sign off for the day they actively avoid MH websites and conspiracy sites moreso
176166289,I think a lot. About anything. And talk. I cant Focus. Does anyone else have similar experience? Im out of control.
176166290,Same for me with tea i drink it almost everyday and sometimes mix them the website wasnt specific on why they shoudnt be mixed so…
176166291,Nice work! 1515
174384571,I don’t think dopamine is entirely blocked I take olanzapine. I think olanzapine only regulates the excess dopamine. So why would it impact my reading. I don’t think it is the cause but at the same time I don’t know why I am this way. I can only think it’s the schizophrenia
176166292,Not at all anymore because I see a lane for myself to take and I don’t desire success. I desire love. Always what I desired. Whatever else happens will be. Has success always been your top desire??

176166294,"I can live without the stimulus, but there were a few things I was looking to by with my stimulus, if I get it. I want a new duffle bag, a good pair of running shoes, and perhaps a new computer. The computer doesn’t have to be anything spectacular. I’ll probably get one that costs less than five-hundred dollars. I’ll hang on to the rest for a while, then, when I am sure I am economically secure, I will probably donate it to worthy causes."

176166296,"I felt like a outcast/ stray dog in my home town before, now? I got over it"
174384572,It runs in the family. My grandmother on my father’s side was committed to a mental hospital and died there. There are other various mentally ill people I am related to.
176166297,1 Go to McDonalds and have breakfast 2. Go to a bakery and have pastries and coffee 3. Go window shopping and get horchatas
176166298,I think with a couple of other posts recently it is just one of those things. Don’t take it to heart. After all it’s a support board and it’s hard not to hit some issues with other folk.
176166299,I’ve decided no more brain scans. I don’t want them because there’s no treatment for what I have except steroids. I try to avoid steroids now. I was on them a really long time and they wreaked havoc on my body. I went to the Cleveland Clinic and even they couldn’t help me. So I just live with it and try to keep my stress low since stress triggers it
176166300,I was talking to my mother tonight about the future and where I want to go in life. I made the mistake of telling her I want to go to college so I can hopefully help people for a living. Instantly she brought up how we can’t afford that and how it will bankrupt our family. And idk it’s true I definitely can’t afford that. And then my mom brought up how my mental health will get in my way and she joyfully reminded me that I’m “not a good student” and how “someone as lazy as me has no chance of succeeding” And idk I feel like there’s so many hurdles in my way. And even if I overcome my own inner problems how am I even going to afford something like that. The price tag alone feels like a game over. Idk what to do I just feel stuck
176166301,Reminds me of a character from the movie “The nightmare before Christmas”
176166302,The person that has deceased that had the biggest impact on me was my grandmother from mum’s side. She was like a second mum. We spend a lot of time together since my parents were always working.

176166305,"I think religion is real. Whenever I go against religion with bad thoughts, I get bad energy around me and religious energy is much more healthy."
176166306,I guess that was what my PHP experience was like. For me I needed routine. I had too much unstructured time and my brain basically was devouring itself. Having something that kept me busy all day got me out of my own head and I was started on new meds there that helped keep me stable once I left.
176166307,"Oh crap sorry, I meant _PERSON_."
176166308,I’m thinking of dropping my AD while under the care of my pdoc. It’s not really doing anything.
176166309,"Earlier today, I walked into my new place and I felt suddenly like I was hearing, seeing some future version of myself walking that same place. I was dissapointed and sad because we were not getting to stay. I felt an evil omen associated with it, like something bad happened. I don’t these often, but a lot of mine have been realized. Scared that this will happen. I love the new place. What I’m scared of is that I lied on the application and said I didn’t have a criminal record. No one rents to you or gives you a job when you do. I usually just write no. As part of the lease it says I need to get one within the first two weeks of moving in. I don’t know what to do. What if I ?????? up? What if like I set my whole family up for failure. Everyone is counting on me, my sister, my partner our son. We would all be out of a place. Homeless I can’t shake that bad feeling off. I hate it. I think if they verbally ask me I’m going to tell them the criminal record is from psychosis, my partner got 
one too because of me. I told the cops things that were not true, I thought he was an undercover cop trying to kill me. I don’t know, there isn’t a lot of people renting where I am. This place was up for over a year. I have good references, and I work. I just feel like the criminal system is all ?????? up cause I can’t move forward in life. It seems like they want people who have mental health issues to stay homeless and jobless forever. What kind of world do we live in? Sorry for my swearing, having a moment. “Breathe”"
176166310,Have a great time!!!

176166315,_AT_MENTION_? You were chosen
176166316,No. They don’t do that. They could lose their license for doing that
176166317,"Well my friends and family value me and I have psychosis. You might be thinking of the _USER_ID_ attached to psychosis. Something my dad told me, along the lines of even though I may have psychosis or manias, There is still a glimmer of gold there. So ya never know what ideas you may come up with. We are very lateral thinkers lol. So lateral it ends up in psychosis land"
176166318,Oh yes I have that I think of something 15-20 seconds ago and I forget…it happens often lately

176166323,I was obsessed because I didn’t understand.
176166324,Cognitive and negative symptoms. I feel like I have mild dementia for real since having sz. “The idea that schizophrenia is a distinct brain disorder is rooted in _NAME_ concept of dementia praecox (_PERSON_ 1910). This concept emphasized one particular aspect of the disorder: the onset of persistent cognitive disturbances early in life.”
176166325,"I havent been psychotic for three or four years now, but I get those nightmares all the time. Rather than being afraid tho I trained my brain to jump into alpha mode those mornings and try to make the very most out of those days. Its a way for me to be thankful knowing it all can come crashing down in a second and to keep on my toes and be proactive with my life and the challenges it brings. It keeps me from being complacent so for that I’m thankful"
176166326,_AT_MENTION_ What do you mean you tried frequencies? What’s that mean?
176166327,"Don’t even start with your need to be aloof and sarcastic about everything. Your post was very triggering to me, and probably also to others who frequent this thread. If you want to talk about making healthy choices and being the best version of yourself, then continue. If you just want to rip on yourself for being fat, go do it somewhere else. I have carved out exactly one thread for people who feel triggered by weight-loss talk. Please respect it."

176166330,I have times where I just feel no emotions at all and just sit and stare at the ceiling for hours but then there are times like this where I’m over emotional and just want to cry at the most silly things and I get angry to easy. I’m having a bad day.
176166331,"Don’t know, but it seems to improve memory and especially concentration for me. I think we’re predisposed to use it because it helps with cognitive decline and negatives."
176166332,"It’s worse to be a Pollyanna, to never worry about anything. Because, sooner or later you crash. I would say take your worries seriously and do what you can. Then you can rest knowing you did the best you could."

176166334,I get nightmares almost every night. Two nights ago I was trapped in a labor camp with bugs crawling all over the walls. Struck terror into my soul. Last night I just dreamed about eating cake at my grandmother’s. That one was just a dream.

I always liked the sales process when I had my small biz so I want to pursue that sort of work more I’ve decided. Like _AT_MENTION_ said there’s many things to try out there.
176166340,"This is true, but you have to try it to know. I was far worse off with nothing to do and I was my own worst enemy when it came to Sz. There is a lot to be said for having decent distraction. Work is one way to achieve this. It works for me as I need structure otherwise I just stay in bed."

174384581,For me severe schizophrenia is when your permanently locked up in a psychiatric hospital and banging your head against the wall. My sister did an internship with a judge who had to go to a psychiatric hospital to decide if people where forced to stay there. One threw a chair to the judge. My sister said that in comparison with them I’m a mild case with insight.

174384587,"Back in hospital due to depression I’ve gone back (despite being on abilify) to feeling split in two different conflicting halves; the ‘normal’, rational and atheistic self, and this other self who believes, or pretends to believe that he was sent by God and got caught in a demonic simulation. So far the normal self is stronger, but my question is, should I be considered delusional if I retain a social self untainted by the beliefs of my ‘delusional’ self? Or is it a question of degress across a spectrum of belief? Thanks"

176166368,"No, not at all. I am of the belief that even though I died to others in the old universe; life continues as before as though it never happened. I will die, just when my life plan is up and there is nothing I can do to alter it. Don’t test this out though!"

176166379,"I’m pretty messed up about the sugar preference thing. Fructose causes brain inflammation, and Dextrose is better but you need heaps of it to be as sweet as table sugar. Also they both raise cancer risk. Like I want to be able to have tea and soda without worrying about getting cancer. I think the _PERSON_ mixture can control small cancerous growths, so I figure if I take one of those every day that negates the risk. I’ve heard testimonials of it reversing advanced cancers, but it’s like you need to change every part of your routine to facilitate healing. Not just eat Budwig solution. Once the growths disappear, you only need one Budwig solution a day for maintenance. And you can loosen up on the restrictions."

Sometimes I feel guilty for not giving him the support he needed. I was not able to help him, but maybe if I was able to help myself, I would have helped him. He was an awesome guy. I just wanted the opportunity to hug him again and say that I loved him. Always value those you love. They will not be here forever, neither you."

176166414,"I’ve been having some obsessive thoughts and I wonder if they might be bordering into delusion territory. I’ve had a thought for months now that my blood and organs are somehow important. That they might save the life of someone I care about. It started when a friend was told they might need a kidney transplant, and kept going when I learned a family member has cancer in multiple bodyparts. I keep diving down wikipedia and google rabbitholes to learn about bloodtypes. This family member has a rare bloodtype, an Rh- one. My type is most likely O, and I’m getting obsessive about finding the cheapest way to determine exactly what my type is, and whether or not I’m O+ or O-. I find myself hoping I’m O- so I can donate to that family member. I know they’re most likely not gonna make it anyways. And this is where it’s starting to get delusional. Sometimes I get these thoughts into my head that there might be enzymes in my blood that could help them fight the cancer. I see signs on my body I 
interpret as signs that I’ve secretly fought cancer and won without knowing it, and I start thinking I can help them fight it. Why is this happening? Is it a delusion or an obsession? Why can’t I let go?"

176166417,I do therapy so I can recognize them and cope with them without meds.
174384596,The thing is that no psychiatrist will prescribe you antipsychotics if you don’t have positive symptoms (Psychosis). No one really knows if you will get psychosis in the future. For me it started like you. You can see another psychiatrist but don’t expect to be prescribed Abilify 10+ mg if you don’t have psychosis.

He may be lashing out because nobody is understanding what he is going through, support him all the way. Sz comes with depression, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, moods and lack of motivation and is very stressful, and can Lead to self-hatred. This could be what he is going through… it’s not all about hallucination, just part of it. Please be with him stay beside and don’t give up on him. Encourage him if he is making a step forward recovery in his own way… weather it be socially or biophysically. Studies say that families are the strongest support system that one could have.

174384602,"Quote from a research: Getting immune cells home Immune cells are recruited to tissues from the lymphatic system via efferent lymphatics in response to insults ranging from skin allergies to flu infection. Immune cells recirculate back to draining lymph nodes via afferent lymphatics. Using a combination of in vitro systems and in vivo studies, _PERSON_ have examined the role of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptors (S1PRs) in the egress of T cells from tissues. They found expression of S1PR1 and S1PR4 on T cells and engagement of S1PR2 on lymphatic endothelial cells to be important for this process.

People like to cite a series of studies proving a 5% loss of IQ in a certain amount of time but 5% is an error level, not a genuine result, it could just as easily have been plus 5% overall. How is an IQ test greater than 95% accurate anyway when everything changes in years going by? I have done approximately 10 IQ tests in 20 yrs and I have had a deviation of 26 points overall. Luckily they all went up gradually. Thinking a lot does not damage the brain unless you are thinking something repeatedly that will make you slower because you are severely stressed out by it. Learning to deviate your delusions towards truth may not be possible if you are not a very logical person, so in that event your IQ may very well go down because you have spent years believing horrible stuff without actually denying it yourself.

176166527,"Most of the times I’ve been in there was a mixture of diagnoses. Here there is only one psych ward to serve the entire interior of _USER_ID_, so usually they divided us up on the severity of the symptoms. Being psychotic or suicidal meant being on the close-supervision ward where there were cameras everywhere, whereas more stable people were on the open ward where they actually had groups and stuff. We had mixtures of depression, sz, bipolar, and addicts detoxing."
176166528,"As some of you know, risperidone has been causing me some trouble as of late. I wrote down a list of pros and cons about my experience with it to show my psych nurse that might give her an idea of a better med to pursue. It’s been over two years now that I’ve been on it so I think I can safely say all these things are true. The good: It keeps psychosis at bay. I’ve noticed I’m a lot more prone to anger if I’ve gone more than a day without it. It helps me concentrate and keeps my mind mostly free of “clutter”. The bad: About thirty minutes after I take it, I get awful depression that typically lasts a couple of hours. It makes me unbearably hungry, and for the worst possible foods - this has been having a negative effect on my physical health. It doesn’t have the sedating effect it used to - I used to rely on it to help me sleep as I’ve always had sleep troubles. I hope this all makes sense. There are also effects from my other meds to consider which I’m sure she’ll also want t
o hear about. Anyway, I’ll keep y’all updated."
176166529,"I’m glad you’re not worried over it. I don’t know your situation, but you know you have sz, so it’s probably just that, however if you are in legitimate danger you should reconsider and move yourself to a safer place for the night. Hope you are ok."
176166531,I met her today and she said that it was basically obligatory to take the shot - not a big problem but it feels like a punishment She also said that OCD and psychosis are treated similarly so the meds would be the same Idk thats probably true but I don’t want to be treated as hallucinating and delusional if I’m only having intrusive thoughts

176166556,"I know that is how it appears to you. You almost never say things to the pretty girls you see. You figured, it’s just one time, what could it hurt? You were trying to be friendly. But I have been the pretty girl in the gym. I actually had to stop going to a traditional gym specifically because of the sheer number of guys who would make comments like that. It was only one time for you. For her, it may have been her tenth comment that day. Women, especially conventionally attractive women, are always aware when there is a man watching them. Especially when the room is completely empty except the two of you. By making the comment, you brought that awareness into sharp relief. You say she was being intentionally sexy. But I wonder if you would have thought the same thing had she been a woman you weren’t personally attracted to. It is good form to stretch out before a workout. It is easier to work out in tight clothes, because they support our curvier bodies better and don’t snag on things. She cl
early went at a time when she thought nobody else would be there. I can almost guarantee she did that on purpose because she didn’t want anyone staring at her as she worked out. It is very hard to work out in a co-_NAME_ gym as a woman without being stared at. As for the content of what you said, I know you meant it as a way to show that you were impressed. But, without the context of knowing you, it could have easily been interpreted as you scoffing at the idea that a woman is capable of lifting heavy weights. Which is something a military woman has likely been told her whole life by random men. Heck, we have even seen people say women don’t belong in the military on this site. The person got suspended for it, but that should tell you how prevalent that mindset is, and why this woman may have interpreted your comment in this way."

174384627,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Jumping to conclusions, general intelligence, and psychosis liability: findings from the multi-centre EU-GEI case-control study. G Tripoli, D Quattrone, L Ferraro, C Gayer-_NAME_, V Rodriguez, C La Cascia, D La Barbera, C Sartorio, F Seminerio, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, PM _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, HE _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _NAME_, BP _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, PC _PERSON_, _NAME_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Psychological medicine, Apr 24 2020 The 'jumping to conclusions' (JTC) bias is associated with both psychosis and general cognition but their relationship is unclear. In this study, we set out to clarify the relationship between the JTC bias, IQ, psychosis and polygenic liability to schizophrenia and IQ.A total of 817 first episode psychosis patients and 1294 population-based controls completed assessments of general intelligence (IQ), an
d JTC, and provided blood or saliva samples from which we extracted DNA and computed polygenic risk scores for IQ and schizophrenia.The estimated proportion of the total effect of case/control differences on JTC mediated by IQ was 79%. Schizophrenia polygenic risk score was non-significantly associated with a higher number of beads drawn (B = 0.47, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.16, p = 0.17); whereas IQ PRS (B = 0.51, 95% CI 0.25-0.76, p < 0.001) significantly predicted the number of beads drawn, and was thus associated with reduced JTC bias. The JTC was more strongly associated with the higher level of psychotic-like experiences (_NAME_) in controls, including after controlling for IQ (B = -1.7, 95% CI -2.8 to -0.5, p = 0.006), but did not relate to delusions in patients.Our findings suggest that the JTC reasoning bias in psychosis might not be a specific cognitive deficit but rather a manifestation or consequence, of general cognitive impairment. Whereas, in the general population, the JTC bias is related to _NAME_, in
dependent of IQ. The work has the potential to inform interventions targeting cognitive biases in early psychosis."

176166570,"My insight is less about my hallucinations and more about my delusions and paranoia… or to put it differently, when I got my insight back it destroyed those delusions. I’m totally in the real world now, no more believing absolute nonsense. My mother was so happy when I got insight back, she often says she thought I was going to be completely unreachable for the rest of my life. It hurt her having to put me out of the house and watch me suffer, whilst all the time I remained angry at her for things she didn’t even do. It took a couple of years after my initial psychotic break for the delusions to go away. I don’t know how long you have had the disease but some people to break free of it in the first 5-10 years, at least for the most part… assuming they seek treatment. As far as voices go, I really wanted to believe that mine were spirits from the afterlife. It’s confusing because a lot of the time they are very kind to me and compliment me when I am feeling like ????. Problem is 10% of t
he time they treat me like garbage. I suppose I am still not 100% convinced they are always false, maybe I never will be. What I need to do is get to a place where I can hold two simultaneous beliefs… that there might be an afterlife, and also that if there is one, it doesn’t necessarily mean I can talk to people there."

176166575,"I tried Brain H.Q., and also a few games like Brain Age, Professor _NAME_, and others. I’m noting some memory attention span issues are like the brain is a “multiprocessor” machine, which creates multiple drafts. Improving memory should require for some, although not others, using multiple therapies, or multiple learning/cognition apps. Earlier, after _PERSON_, other therapies were like Logotherapy such as explained in Man’s Search for Meaning by _NAME_, or Humanistic therapy based upon _NAME_ implying improvement in memory by writing out thoughts as an Alienienation narrative. Also a more libinal Reichian therapy. Some points of therapy though could resemble Ego therapy, like in _NAME_. Also _PERSON_. In conclusion the book series Dianetics used independently with this is worth considering, too. Still some of these have different side effects. Actually my understanding was many practitioners prefer cognitive behavioral therapy, or logotherapy. Going far enough into memory to restore loss o
f memory resembles a term like Engram, or Enneagram. Using this approach then there will be possible behavioral or emotional changes. I’m noting then besides Logotherapy or CBT, others could be more interested in _NAME_ or _NAME_. Logotherapy and CBT have fewer mood swings, or enneagrams, possibly. The main point then is like Multiple Intelligences. The software therapy improves math, the existentialist therapy or enneagram improves remembering names and words. although this is not proven as well as I would assume some believe."

PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR HEALTHCARE ADVICE First when I wrote this I had insomnia, was upset and about to see the nurse the next day. I didn’t want to go, but it was the right choice. Even though I’m on medicine, I can still get paranoid and delusional if I have insomnia or stay up two nights in a row and not rest/hydrate. I also have only been truly stable in the recent year since re-starting the medicine and going on the monthly injections. I was paranoid and I don’t want people to think Palestine has anything to do with terrorism or cults. The Priory of Sion info and binder was from a retreat called Ezekial Place, it was a workshop my mom took before she went to the Middle East in 2004. They supported Peace between Palestine and Israel and teaching peace/conflict resolution to children. My mom said they were beautiful people in Palestine, Kind and compassionate, welc
omed her in like family. I don’t want this to be about politics or conspiracy theories. I was upset and feeling scared. It’s not healthy to think this way. To create conspiracy theories out of nowhere. So please try to keep a healthy mind set through this difficult time. The pandemic is scary, but it’s not the new world order, it’s not a cult-conspiracy, it wasn’t caused by bill gates, we don’t know yet so it’s better not to speculate at all and just follow the advice of healthcare workers and science that don’t want overcrowded hospitals or deaths from exposure.

176166620,For a long while I felt butthurt about it till I got some perspective. It wasn’t personal and it’s all about appropriatness. Took me a long while to learn that lesson but after becoming a mod I found it’s still not personal. I have good relationships with people I’ve censored. It’s just the community we all participate in so we are all apart of maintaining standards.

174384650,I think working all your life to pay for a house is sad. So I’m going to take a non-traditional approach to life and live on my savings which were going to be a downpayment on a house. I don’t want to work with schizophrenia.
176166622,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ , my birthday was June 21."
176166623,Lots of people don’t work but they still get by. And a group home or supported housing may be an option for you in the future. You probably won’t be living in luxury in those but many of them feed you and help you with basic needs. And they’re much better than living on the streets.
174384654,I would have ask him if he’s a psychiatrist? Same for same?
174384652,This is something I do too. I feel I just have bad memories. I wonder is that phenomenon related to schizophrenia?

176166630,I hope you can feel more positive about life someday. It’s hard to be down all the time. Is there anything in life that makes you happy or for which you’re thankful?

176166634,"As I’ve understood it, the fluid expression of identity refers to having problems figuring out how one wants to present, and often changing looks and styles to try and find an identity. One could argue that’s what most trans folks end up doing, but it seems to me like trans folks are kinda just trying out looks until they find one they like, while some bpd folks desperately keep changing to find some sort of identity. My psych thinks I have bpd, and after doing extensive reading about it, I can’t say I disagree. And btw some of you mentioned trauma, it is entirely possible to have bpd without having had severe trauma."

What freaks me out is when people become consumed by their delusions and accuse people who oppose them of lying or not being smart enough to understand. Like there’s no way of getting them into their heads that maybe, just maybe you’re dealing with symptoms of your illness. I had some correspondence with a girl today who said she belived nothing was wrong with her and the staff at her hospital should allow her to self-harm and throw up her food because it’s the only way she feels calm, and that reality is just a lie she needs to be freed from. It creeps me out how people can lose that much touch with reality. Especially considering in my country, people who get an sz diagnosis are sent to psychoeducation classes where they are told everything there is to know about the illness."

This certainly contributes to my rejection socially Do I care how others see me? Now I know from before that some of you will say to exercise. Can anyone tell me this has worked on their gut?

My psychotic story kind of developped further, with more and more desperate and bizar story line. The last time i very slowly withdrew though and my symptoms eventually became more mild again than before…more hypervigilance/distrust based on experiences (“oh no…is this a sign he will abuse me?”/“i did something bad, now im a bad person”) than bizar delusions (“there is a time portal in my bed room and when i flush the toilet i will go to hell”)."

It was induced by stress from last week. The last time I had stress it was in June and it induced hypomania but this time the depression came. The voices and inserted thoughts and intrusive thoughts come and go but the depression / negatives remain. I feel like an empty shell. Am I relapsing? I don’t know. I did a depression test I regularly do and it said my depression has progressed from moderate to severe. I wanted to phone my pdoc’s office this afternoon but it just rang. S**t. Now I have to wait till Monday to make appointment. I whatsapped him earlier in the day telling him everything I shared with you guys in previous threads recently, and he said I must come see him and we can discuss it. Ive increased my lamotrigine from 150mg to 175mg and will increase it to 200mg in a week or two to see if it will help. By then I

176166695,"There is no way to speed up the process. Weight loss of around 1 pound is healthy and ideal. A pound of fat is made of 3500 calories. You need to count calories or portion control at the very least. Aim for about 500 caloric deficit per day and 7 days a week, then you will lose a pound a week. Eat more vegetables and protein as they make you feel full. Cut down on the carbs and unhealthy fats. I ate 1400 calories to lose weight."

The bad side of it was that my doctor really let me down and I felt I couldn’t trust him."
176166712,I plan on at least lowering it if not coming off it completely and substituting with a anti depressant like prozac or paxil. Those would keep me under control while possibly at the same time offering me some relief from cognitive decline and maybe some other symptoms.

176166737,"I see. Yes, the same thing happened with my grandpa. When people are cachectic, eating and drinking can be painful because the body has shut down its digestive processes because it’s preparing itself for death. If she asks for food or water, then get her some, but other than that, leave it alone because the body no longer needs food or water. You need sustenance to live, but you don’t need it to die."

176166758,Trust me suicide is no fun even if it sounds fun. You will be in more pain during suicide than now. I tried suicide 3 times and once was very close to die. I was intoxicated and vomiting from intentional Tylenol overdose. If my parents came late home that day I would be dead. They cried when they saw me. They brought me to the emergency and drs said I would have been dead from complete liver failure if I came later. I had liver pain especially when eating dairy products for the past 9 years. Now pain nearly disappeared since I was put on high blood pressure and high cholesterol meds.
174384693,i’m on risperdal consta 50mg and my sleep is good… but i also have to say i also take clozapine 200mg so i’m not sure if just the risperdal is enough to knock me out.

176166761,I have that happen to me all the time. I crack up when the first thing they say in a super excited voice when they walk in my room is: well at least you don’t have cancer! I mean was I supposed to think I did? It better not be cancer! You don’t need that…keep us posted on your results.
176166762,Welcome to life. Everyone does this.
176166763,"Yeah, but 400mg is the effective dosage for sz or anxiety as studied if I remember correctly. If a lower dosage works, that’s great."
176166764,"Why do you say that? Of course there is and rape is a crime punished by the law. Its damaging psychologically. I read some of rape victims become prostitutes because they become hypersexual, loose their emotions and become promiscuous from public rape. Sex isn’t healthy when its forced and when its not private."
174384694,well then you are forgiven imo
176166765,"Well, based on what I see of you on the forum, I don’t hate you at all. This might be your poor self esteem talking"
176166766,Sorry your feeling anxious mate. What about a cup of yorkshire with some tunes on? It may distract you. You got any video games you can play?
176166767,"I don’t remember, but it only tests one or two of like 7 categories of intelligence. I think it does logic and spatial reasoning, mostly. But there is also cognitive empathy, and verbal reasoning, and a bunch of others. If you don’t do well on the official IQ test, it doesn’t mean you are dumb. It means your skills aren’t in the area of that particular test."
176166768,"Yeah, that’s a good idea. Play it when the winning amount is a huge amount of money."
174384697,"I was on Zyprexa from 2008 to 2011 when I came down with diabetes. I went on Risperidone then. In November 2019 I switched back to Zyprexa 10mg due to low testosterone and _NAME_. My weight and blood sugar shot up, so I went on Abilify May of this year. My blood sugar is near normal now, and I’m losing weight. My anxiety is gone. The thing I didn’t know what I was having mood swings. These went away. I mostly noticed being down was gone. I’m not sure about the highs. Originally I was diagnosed SzA, but that was charged in the hospital to paranoid Sz."

I am disappointed by this but I see how psychiatrists feel now. I do not need the two week extension. I am a man of my word. Please annonymize my account. Thank you."
176166781,"Yeah, it has slowed down some now, but it will be a very busy morning. The coworker I relieved said he would call and check on me, take over here if I need him to, but I haven’t heard from him yet. I hope like hell that he calls.

176166791,"Well sometimes getting clean takes drastic measures. If you are living where there’s a lot of drugs or hanging out with people who do drugs or drink, than yeah, a move might be in order. That was a huge help in the beginning of my recovery when I moved out of a small apartment complex where everybody was doing coke and dealing coke and away from all my friends who were doing drugs. I I have to admit, my move was involuntary, lol, I was three months behind on rent and I got invited to leave. But getting away from an environment with a lot of drug use helped me immensely and I don’t hang around with anybody who does drugs or abuses alcohol. AA recommends it. If you are trying to get clean and sober and you are still around drugs and alcohol a lot the temptation just chips away at your willpower and resolve."
176166792,"Also, I don’t want to be trusted with more responsibility than I can handle."
176166793,"Much appreciated once again _AT_MENTION_ . Now go kick some ass on the cricket field, lol!"
176166794,"I feel the same way. I would love to since it would make me feel better but I just don’t know how. that is the thing. how can I think ok yea it is fine, when it is not.

I really don’t know how people can do this, how??? I don’t know what to do, It feels like someday my soul will leave my body and my body will die…"

176166802,I suppose I’m better than when I was psychotic. I still have negatives that drive me up a wall though.
176166803,"I’m guilty of being duped by so-called miracles in drug advertising. They (the new meds, individually) are touted as amazing but soon disappoint. No longer. The largest shift I’ve seen was everyone on typicals being converted (mostly) to atypicals. I remember when Haldol was the cure-all in the state hospital. Depressed? Haldol. Anxious? Haldol. Eating disorder? Haldol. Headache? Haldol. In-grown toenail? Haldol. Ugh. I remember so many other patients being disfigured as they snowed the patients with Haldol 4 times a day. I’m not optimistic about any great leaps forward in sz medication. Been told that lie too much. Cure? As likely as winning the lotto. I echo what _AT_MENTION_ said: age has brought about less optimism, not more."
176166804,If you live in the US they’ll declare you to be normal so they can get you off the disability rolls and you can join in the prosperity where there are more jobs than applicants in the US by taking a minimum wage job of your choice.

174384708,"Which meds? I went off risperidone by using abilify and then going off abilify. Personally, abilify was an easier ap to withdraw from compared to risperidone. I was fine for about 3 weeks, then i made the mistake of posting on some of my old haunts, they proceeded to gangstalk me again and i ended up back on medication. You learn though. So if i were you, id try abilify on a low dose to counter the aps withdrawals you are on currently then going through the abilify withdrawal."
176166812,"good news never gets old. yay, for you."
176166813,_AT_MENTION_ Vacations are expensive. Stay home and binge watch Netflix.
176166814,"For me it worsened it a lot. My parents said so too. I was always the top in most of my school classes. Super clean and super organized. Had lots of smart friends. Never got mad or violent. During psychosis I nearly became a criminal. Made bad drug addicts friends. I became irritable, always mad, violent etc But meds got some of my original personality back. I am waay less violent. I got rid of all my bad friends. I have 3 good ones left but I only speak to them online everyday. I am somewhat organized. But I stay in bed all day and only bath once every week. I see that meds did improve me and kept me out of prisons and away from death."
176166815,Sometimes they do yes. But you have a choice to be controlled or not. They do demand a reaction to them and that changes our course a little or a lot.
176166816,My doctor just tells be that it’s impossible for people to hear my thoughts or read my mind
176166817,"Remember it’s absolutely not real, There’s no way they can know your thoughts."
176166818,Can’t they mail meds to you when you need them? But discuss your medication questions with your doc. And don’t wait until the last minute.

176166832,When I was doing volunteer work I was delusional and believed those I volunteer worked with and for were against me etc I couldn’t do it. Not at the last few places I couldn’t but many years ago I worked part time. Maybe in the future I will try again but I just recently moved and am just getting in to routine here with exercise etc When I’m steady stable and well in that perhaps. I might be starting a community course in card making one day a week for a couple hours I think.

176166841,after how much time this happen ? and what symptoms did you have
176166843,I think _AT_MENTION_ did. She may have some better insight.
174384711,"I am not a fan of antipsychotic,or believe in schizophrenia as a illness because I could somewhat function at 60-70% of what normal people does.I did have delusion when things get really stressful and have had sleep problem but I never had voices.I find that taking this meds made me even less social then normal.If I didn’t marry her,I have already been 2 years off meds. My aunty told me,you take the medicine because of her.Which means she said the reason I take the meds is for my wife.When I went back to the psychiatrist,the doctor knew I dislike meds,he asked if I prefer psychotherapy instead of medicine?"
176166844,A friend told me about one case were some people bought dodgy vape liquid for stupidly low prices. It turned out it had lead in it and they had serious lung issues (hospitalised).

174384714,It took a couple weeks to kick in fully if I remember correctly. I do remember feeling a change in mood from the first pill. I also started on 1.5 and worked my way to 3 mg.
176166854,No I don’t think so.
176166855,2 hospitalizations back to back 4 years ago. Lasted 5 weeks altogether.
176166856,"I guess it’s the act of working it’s better than nothing from their viewpoint: you’re contributing. Honestly, I tried DoR and never got far: too much paranoia. They delete your case or file after a while. Same thing with disability at college after a semester, which is unrelated and is total BS. I tried volunteering years ago and got triggered by random homeless people. You cannot have more than 2000 in money/assests on SSI and probably would lose benefits if I tried working through DoR. SSI is way different than SSDI and I never paid into the system. I never worked really. I figured I would pull something like _NAME_ Author lol. You know be a self-made millionaire. You cannot rely on the government in most cases. I figured they owe me money but won’t collect. It’s a pipe dream."

176166860,I know that I am one of the guiltiest members here when it comes to that. I shouldn’t ever say that I am “cured” or have “zero symptoms” but rather say that my MI is more or less controlled with ongoing medication treatment.

I hope I wont get excited like this again… I try to “revive” myself like this too tbh, but we need calm mostly I think… This wont happen often again, isn’t it?

176166878,"Do you go to _USER_ID_ meetings? I tried going and admitting to my diagnosis and I was basically ostracized. It really hurt my feelings. If I ever go to a meeting again, I’ll lie and say I just have depression and anxiety. I do struggle with both so it’s not completely a lie though. But I guess that defeats the purpose of going. Maybe I just won’t go again. Do the meetings help you? Do you admit your diagnosis?"
176166879,"Haha true enough. I guess the past is the past, anyway."
174384719,Now what are your diagnosis?
176166880,"_PERSON_: what you describe is much familiar to me. Especially the part where you suggest that third parties were involved in sparking and then fueling your delusions. After years of suffering, I suspect that no matter the source, these are all nonsense especially produced by your own brain to excuse issues or problems you had previously, maybe as old as early childhood. I suggest you examine your actions with cruelty and suspicion. Then you just might gain clarity. This is what helped me personally."
176166881,I want people to stop calling me.
176166882,"What?! Justifying yourself? I have never suggested you do that for me or anyone else. You just said that it put really dark thoughts in your head for three hours. You’ve been saying that it decimates your cognition for days. That’s not supposed to happen. I don’t know you, but you don’t know me either. I’m not the sort of person who’s willing to take the blame for things that aren’t my fault, and I don’t apologize for things I didn’t do, no matter how insignificant. All I said was that you should talk to your pdoc and get another assessment and tell them everything. I don’t care what your diagnosis is, I really don’t. But diagnoses are important because they let your doctor have some basic guidelines on how to treat you, what to expect from you, what challenges you might face and how such challenges will impact your stability. That’s the only reason I mentioned your diagnosis. _NAME_. At this point, I’m getting frustrated. From the beginning, I and many others have told yo
u that meds aren’t always enough. They’re not even usually enough. They’re primitive, to say the least. Chemical lobotomies, in the severest cases. You keep on telling us that your 15 to 20 years of isolation mean that your meds will take years to heal you, but that’s just not how it works. We tell you this, but then you get pissed because you don’t want to hear anyone tell you that you actually have to work to recover. You have to challenge yourself, because doing the same thing over and over won’t help. It just won’t. We can’t do it for you, but you’ll never have to do it alone. You told me about how everyone else gave up on trying to help you recover. I asked you if you wanted my help, no strings attached, and I said that I’d never give up on you. You told me that that was what you wanted, and because of that, I still will never give up on you. But I can’t help you if you don’t throw me a bone, because right now, you’re just chunking magic 8 balls at my face. I’m not psychic, _N
AME_. If you need something from me, then you’ve got to ask for it, and if you want me to back off? Well, you’re going to have to tell me that too, but if it’s what you truly desire, then I will oblige. I’m not here to harass you, _NAME_."
176166883,I mean it’s possible to have undetected DID and you most likely wouldn’t have insight about it but depending on circumstances it’s unlikely. I mean idk your life but it seems you’re pretty active with your treatment. Surely someone would have picked up on it or asked you questions about it to make sure. It’s pretty rare at least

There’s always going to be teenage and twenty year old jerks but I have to show more restraint and play it cooler. I’m the adult here.
176166892,Oh lord have mercy on this guy the unbeliever hint (it’s true)
174384720,There are some that believe schizophrenia can be part of an awaking to spiritual consciousness. A door to or the 3rd eye is open to things and yes some are awful and torturous. I am a believer in the spiritual realm. I have studied a lot about science and spirituality and religion. I believe there is a huge part of this that is due spiritual attacks. I know this doesn’t align with the medical theories or the overall gist of this website. So I hope I am allowed to express this opinion here. For me personally it is about growth and overcoming in peaceful ways the trials and tribulations I face. Peace to you all. May you find healing.

176166901,I took topamax and it caused me to have rage. I had to stop it because the aggressive behavior became psychotic. Keep a lookout for increased anger. It’s a listed side effect.

176166910,"Been working pretty steadily since 1984 albeit mostly part time. I’ve been at my janitor job 6 years now. I’ve always worked pretty much alone, now with the Covid thing I have whole wings of buildings to work in all by myself. I come in the morning, punch in, and the bos tells me what to do and I go off on my own for most of the day. If I finish an hour before quitting time, he’lll give me some bulls*it, easy job just to kill time until we get off. Anyways, this job is easy; I’ve had harder ones where I worked my ass off doing manual labor. 6 years is a record for me for staying at a job. I’ve had a couple other jobs for four years, a couple other for three years."

176166911,I think you have schizotypal personality disorder. That’s my humble opinion. I’m not a doctor but if I were on five antipsychotics and they weren’t working I would seriously question it.
176166912,Volunteer a couple of hours I hope. Have a dip in public pool. Buy tea and bread and toilet paper.
176166913,Just plain old addiction. You’re stuck using that thing every few minutes because you’re hooked. It becomes less pleasant and more of a fix. You’re a slave to it.

174384731,Some people can do drugs all their lives and never get schizophrenia. Some individuals are naturally high and shouldn’t mess with their brain chemistry because naturally high people are more prone to schizophrenia. I posted an article on this site not long ago about naturally high people.

Can you tell her to? No Wishing you the best with everything my friend. Good luck with your sister as well. That sounds like a tough one"
176166925,"That’s awesome! I’m glad things have gotten so much better for you. I found a good antidepressant for me that’s taken the edge off my depression so I’ve been embracing life more, too.

Of the total time it takes to master something, 20% of the time gets you 80% of the total results, and the remaining 80% of the time is needed for that last 20%. That’s where it gets world class. But if you could get to that 80% you’d be pretty happy, I bet."

176166934,If my child needed medication in order to have a successful and happy life I would give it to them. Just like one of my children has asthma and uses an inhaler as well as steroids and antibiotics. I would give him whatever he needs to be healthy and functional. Without those meds he would die. It’s just the same for a child who has a mental illness.
176166935,Go to the emergency if you’re feeling suicidal. That’s suicidal stuff. Tell your parents to bring you to the emergency.
176166936,Hang in there rocket. The last two years I’ve only been able to make it 3 to 6 months. Ever since being suicidal the Spring of 2019. Maybe this time I’ll make it past six months.
176166937,"I took Sertraline for anxiety and it didn’t work. They then put me on Pregabalin, and that has been a game changer!"
176166938,"Is it a natural biproduct of the environment or is it just the way it pans out, medical science is really struggling with the wrong organ, the brain is functional, the liver is not, that’s why all anti-psychotics damage the liver, killing the patient slowly and turning them into zombies. It is a conspiracy by big pharma and I’m surprised that my compatriots condone it."
176166939,Hm okay _PERSON_ i tried to drink while i am on meds but i just got weird feeling like more drunk than usulaly But soon i will be off meds so i cant wait for my first beer after all this time and yes going to a bar cant wait for this pandemic to stop
176166940,"I believe that too, but I read an article which said when you put on muscle that muscle is “storage for carbs” or something. As such, you can eat more carbs when you put on muscle (pounds of muscle). Otherwise, I eat carefully but never count calories. My belief is that not eating on atypical antipsychotics makes you miserable. For me, I eat when I feel ravenous and when I don’t. _PERSON_, typical aps make me hold onto what I eat. It’s not a matter of self control, at least it hasn’t been for me. Micromanaging the way I looked is a way in which I managed losing control of my mind and accepting that I felt ravenous. I’m not taking atypical aps right now. Still, for me, accepting that I would look fatter, was a part of being mentally healthy. Starving myself and ever even looking at scales made me sad. Fluctuations in “blood sugar…insulin”, that exacerbates my mood symptoms. Eating regular meals 3 times a day imho, like in the hospital, at regular intervals, I feel, helps with my mo
ods and circadian rhythm. I eat a lot of sweet potatoes, I also eat bran flakes cereal, which is very high in fiber. I take 3 fish oil pills and 500mg vitamin d. My mom also bought a woman’s multivitamin…but I don’t believe those help. I do intermittent fasting too, unintentionally, here and there…usually it just involves not eating between a few hours before going to sleep and waking up. I take l-theanine with relora and gaba from source naturals before bed, and during the day. It significantly decreases my appetite. Also I’m manic, that makes me less hungry. I don’t substitute meals with protein supplements, but I drink whey protein and it fills me up. I drink plenty of water, too, and drinking it with the whey protein helps me drink more, because it tastes great! I don’t drink a whole scoop, I eat various protein rich foods, then I drink a half or 1/3 or a scoop, etc. Or sip it throughout the day. Another thing is accepting subcutaneous fat. It’s not unhealthy, rather the fat which surround
s the organs, that’s where the issue lies."

176166947,You are more than a material brain working with chemicals and electricity _AT_MENTION_ . You have an immaterial mind also. The brain’s plan for sz is fight or flight. We either argue with our voices or beg them to let us escape. That never works. We can use our mind to soothe our brain. Not easy but over time it works.

176166960,"It sounds like your mind is in turmoil and out of control. Are you taking meds? I would try to simplify. If you can’t make sense of the past or your thoughts you need to focus on the present and the immediate future. Everything else is irrelevant regardless, even if you did have other lives. My mind has had similar thoughts as you when in psychosis, but right now my life dosen’t have to be more complex than a cup of tea and a song on the radio. Try to take care of your immediate life instead of cracking the code to your existence, because such a mission always ends up in the desert and there is nothing there."

176166986,"Otrawhattheheck. I know you wrote the website outersecrets and revealed the truth. Great work. I have a few questions regarding all of this. I think this post is very relevant because it is connected to the truth about schizophrenia and because these are important questions that regards the structure of all existence. I have read the entire website and have through experience experienced a deeper more profound reality than normal regular daily life. In regards to the outersecrets website and the truth. Are you willing to explain the mechanics of how ALL are going to reach the true Heaven? That is a true heaven for ALL. How could such a place be created, a place of Holy truth where no one suffers and there are no Lies at all (?). But you say Truth related to Lies equals something… So how would the True Heaven for ALL be realistically speaking? How can Lies simply cease to exist and now ONLY PURE TRUTH is existing … Is that even possible? What would happen to Satan, since Satan is the father of a
ll Lies? Would Satan be completely wrecked and never exist again or would he merge with The Truth? And in regards to Satan… Is Satan really a existing Figure, the -one and only- type of being. or is it just someone who plays a character role of a false God… ? what I mean is, the positive side of the holistic reality are composed of -many gods- ? and the negative side is composed of -many satans- ? Or is Satan a solo being, there can only be one Satan, and those who side with him?"

I say things like “This is where I live, this is where I’ll die.” I don’t know why this helps more than what she suggested.

Discussing fasting isn’t exactly against the rules but from my understanding it is frowned upon because some of our friends here have battled with eating disorders.

176167001,"I got back ordered in March in the US when I was getting the Teva generic and ended up having to go off of it. Two months later, in May, I got a call from my pharmacy saying it was available to pick up, though I had already switched meds. The shortage was not and is still not on the FDA shortage list, not as current or resolved, and I could not find any info anywhere. My only guess is that it may be because one major generic producer (Teza Pharmaceuticals) is now marketing the inhalant version, Adusuve, but that’s just a guess. There is an info number for the fda, or you could look up other producers which are hopefully available. I know _PERSON_ is _PERSON_’s competitor and refused to be bought out 4 years ago, so Teva has a loxapine generic, as does Mylan. Identify your producer by identifying the pill (letters and numbers) and see who your maker is. So if you’ve been getting the Teva generic, look up if in any reachable distance a pharmacy in your surrounding areas has the Mylan generic, o
r vice versa. Best of luck!"

174384759,https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1982-acupuncture-provides-schizophrenia-relief The results of this study indicate that acupuncture is a useful adjunct to the antipsychotic medication clozapine for the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. It has the potential to enhance efficacy and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions and is worthy of clinical consideration.
176167018,I was not a normal child. I was not understood by anyone. Definitely not my parents. I hated being a child n teen sucked too. My best I have been is probably the last four years I think. I had apathy depression etc and hopeless as a child . No never felt normal. My mum thinks I’m autistic.
176167019,"As a kid, I had no friends to mend my boredom. They called me pussy because I couldn’t stand up for myself. Can you imagine a fat kid who had no friends and was harassed by literally everyone he met? While everyone was out on the playground, I was at home by my lonesome. I had nobody to turn to, my father was constantly working to pay dues. I had no clue on what to do. So I turned to music and video games to change my mood. Scribbled in notepads to avoid the emotions flowing out. Played games that only a sick kid could have. I had the mind of a madman at a young age, all because I had no real role models to look up to. I remember my mom crying because she had just lost her mother. She spiralled into depression and I had no idea what she was going through. I saw her taking pills and wondered what were those things she was ingesting. She just told me she just had the flu. My father was a hard working man and I dont blame him. I remember him promising me he’d play Lego with me and he just disappea
red to his room. Next time I’d seen him was probably not too soon. So I turned to drugs to make way for people that I thought mattered. To feel connected in ways that I could have never had."

174384770,"If that’s the case, You may need to switch medications."
176167033,I had sexual delusions and voices too. Also actors and people I know having sex all day and night. I heard them moaning and it tortured me to hear them having sex. My best friends who were really actors pretending and paid to be my friends were having sex with my soul mate and any man who was interested in me and saying not to be with me. My soul mate said if you cut your feet I will be faithful so I cut my feet til it was bleeding. He said that’s not deep enough. I couldn’t walk on my feet for a long time. When I was flying they were having sex with the pilot to get power over him and make him do what they wanted. I hated hearing moans. I got spontaneous orgasms believing I was feeling my soul mates orgasms. It was so awful and my body was always tense. Bad sexual things happened to me in the past so maybe it was post traumatic stress. After eight years or so it just went away one day. Thankfully! Maybe talk to your dr about medication increases or change.

176167054,"Without a religious description, I believe that your story continues on by anyone who remembers you. Your friends will live on thinking about you and often remember you. I’ve had my dad say a few words when we visited my grandfather’s grave, such as “hey dad, how are you doing in heaven?” and I realized that my grandfather’s story lives on in my dad."
176167055,Yeah. If you find one that works for you it is better but it is definitely necessary. otherwise the psychosis continues and that can lead to an even worse outcome. A permanent psychosis.
176167056,I guess you’re right

176167066,"_AT_MENTION_ , you’re right. Daily fluctuations in weight make it silly and frustrating to weigh yourself daily. I like to weigh myself daily purely out of habit."
176167067,"It will likely fade over time. I did superficial cuts with a straight edge razor on my left arm and I have to purposely look for them to find them. I have a deeper scar on my left hand that’s more noticeable but that was much more invasive. They just look like slightly lighter skin. I did mine when I was about 14 and now I’m 37 so it’s been some time. The others had good ideas to hide them for now, are you male or female? If you’re female you could wear a light breezy cover up or _NAME_ cover up when you want to hide it during the summer. In the meantime, try not to be hard on yourself. Not all who cut themselves do it for attention, for me I had a bad reaction to antidepressants and was going through some horrible family problems. Maybe it was partly a cry for help, but I’m not ashamed anymore. It’s part of my history, and every part of your history brings you to where you are today. And I wouldn’t trade my today for the world."

176167073,"I have a base heartrate of 120, when I have a panic attack it hits 150 or more. I’ve been on heart meds for it to slow it down, it doesn’t. I love going to a new doctor or the ER and watching them freak, then tell them to look at the chart on their spiffy computer and see the notes from cardiologist. Born with a bad heart, got the genetic suckage from both sides of family. Also am supposed to have a valve replaced but they put it off cause they don’t know how to handle the excessive bloodloss I experience with medical procedures. Last med procedure was the birth of my daughter. Was not a good day for either of us. I ended up with 4 bags of blood, and they couldn’t justify basically wasting anymore because 1 my iron level only went up to 4. And 2 medicaid said they didn’t wanna pay if it was a medical waste. So 6 days in hospital, and 3 days later we found out why still bleeding, 14 inches of placenta left attached and sepsis set in, er had to go in and take it out, no pain meds, just grab
bed with a tool and pulled. Took 10 mins, and holy ????, I did all 3 births no pain meds, that was way worse than any part of birth. I thought he was pulling out part of my chest the way it felt. But alas, lol. If you have palpitations you’re worried about, see if you can see a GP or a cardiologist to weed out any defects."

They really don’t fully go away, although the difference now is that I have insight where’s 5 years ago I had zero insight. I mean should I tell my doctor?

I’m interested to hear them if anyone has. Thanks!"

He wrote the first book after recovering from a single episode of psychosis, and the second one after recovering from a relapse. I read the second. In it, he apologizes for assertions he made in the first book, because at the time he believed he could 100% avoid a relapse if he stayed making healthy choices."
176167085,That’s still not good. Take your normal med. You don’t want to have a psychotic episode and have all your hard work be for nothing Please taper with your pdoc.
176167086,"My brother-in-law is a sleep psychologist and when my sleep was poor (well it’s still not great) he advised less sleep to improve it. So maybe sleeping too much matters as the quality is not good? He advised a sleep schedule where I stayed up and then was strict to wake myself up at a certain time. I did not end up following it after week 2, too hard. For me it is really hard not to stay in bed for as long as possible. I then get scared I’ll never get out of bed. Lately on my days off I’ve been getting out of bed around 10am or sometimes noon, which I’m ok with. I love those moments of blissful sleep though!"

176167131,Today I had a difficult day. Was at church and seeing these all these intrusive thoughts and having people put images and words in my mind. I don’t want to have people in my body. I would like to go out still and not have my voices hinder me from enjoying my day.
176167132,"Also, it is incredibly common for women/men in abusive relationships to find it terribly hard to leave. So common someone i know did a study about why women return to abusive partners and long back to them, even if they know they are not okay. She researched why, and how to help them, which was a very important question the domestic violence therapists had, because all their clients struggled with it. There are all sorts of dynamics in abusers, victims and their relationships that make leaving hard and repetition common. It is, for example, very natural to get strongly attached to someone who is sometimes loving, sometimes cruel, and find it difficult to withstand that. Most women (she didnt look at men), needed several attempts before they could break out."
174384791,"Be cautious, abilify seems to work for everybody at first and then stop working. Abilify also not as effective as risperidone. I can’t imagine how 1.5 mg risperidone gets your prolactin high, when I lowered my dose to 2 mg I had normal libido and actually lost a lot of weight. 1.5mg risperidone is a therapeutic dose."

I feel like I can hardly do anything because of my lack of motivation and lack of concentration. How do you deal with negative symptoms? How do you cope? What do you do to get by, day by day? _USER_ID_: trying to be less negative"

176167135,"This could be a problem though, as he is a hot head and from a notorious local Italian family who have a bit of a reputation in my town. Not sure if they still do, but it’s really dodgy thing to deal with. I just feel like he was trying to manipulate me using the nostalgia of things we used to get up to I think you’re right there. For me this is ancient history, but he’s still in the thick of it all. The only thing I can ‘score’ drug wise these days is Diazepam from the doctor, but that doesn’t make me high"

176167141,"Meditate. Sit comfortably. Close your eyes if you can. Keep them open if you can’t. Of course blink as needed. Focus on your breathing. Force out any thoughts, and thoughts at all. If you can only go a second or two before a new thought enters, start over. It’s okay if you can only go seconds at a time with a clear mind. Practice practice practice! Practice sober, practice if you drink or whatever, and practice as you feel yourself slipping. Even when I’m in full blown psychosis, meditation helps."
176167142,Yes. I am an Indian. If the disease is severe like the patient throwing tantrums or in deep depression then an experienced psychiatrist will start with optimum dose to quickly control the disease and gradually decrease the dose when the patient is stabilized and then reach the maintenance dose and stay with it.
174384784,You probably had something full spectrum. To OP: There is so much misinformation on CBD… Im not even sure how it works. There are tinctures/isolated/smokables/topicals/etc. basically some cbd products have more thc in them than others. And this market is not regulated yet.

Also another time I had to leave the house because I mentioned johns daughter, _NAME_ said don’t mention my daughter again. Also reflect on the ecstasy of not having anybody hear your thoughts. I once thought about rape and _NAME_ heard me even though he wasn’t with me, he said you better not have said what I think you said. I thought he could hear my every thought but it didn’t work with _NAME_."
174384792,I’ve always felt that on the one hand I had schizophrenia but on the other hand I had bizzare good luck to make up for it. I think today that delusion has faded. Absolutely nothing bad happened but the feeling has just vanished. I know a lot of us are “lucky” in the sense that things could always be worse but I had an exaggerated sense of being lucky. Anyway like I said. Another delusion bites the dust.

176167159,That might be true But crime for sz ppl are at the same level as the gen pop if not less (from the statistics) but media it’s more likely to broadcast a news of a sz person killing somebody instead of a normal one. Some people can’t accept the fact that ppl kill and blame it on mentall illness Cluster b of PD is very likely to commit acts of violents including murders (from the statistics is the highest rate in mi) also drug use is another factor plus not taking treatment or being under a lot of stress It’s easier to blame the severe mentally ILl

Isn’t that where a person’s inner mental life means more to them than common, everyday discourse? If that’s the case, it is very good for a creative life to be schizotypal. You do have to stay in touch with the ordinary conventions, though. You don’t want to lose yourself in solitude. It can be a delicate balance."

174384802,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Schizophrenia Identification Using Multi-View Graph Measures of Functional Brain Networks. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology, 2019 Schizophrenia (SZ) is a functional mental disorder that seriously affects the social life of patients. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of SZ has raised extensive attention of researchers. At present, study of brain network based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has provided promising results for SZ identification by studying functional network alteration. However, previous studies based on brain network analysis are not very effective for SZ identification. Therefore, we propose an improved SZ identification method using multi-view graph measures of functional brain networks. Firstly, we construct an individual functional connectivity network based on Brainnetome atlas for each subject. Then, multi-view graph measures are calculated by the brain network analys
is method as feature representations. Next, in order to consider the relationships between measures within the same brain region in feature selection, multi-view measures are grouped according to the corresponding regions and Sparse Group Lasso is applied to identify discriminative features based on this feature grouping structure. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed to perform SZ identification task. To evaluate our proposed method, computational experiments are conducted on 145 subjects (71 schizophrenic patients and 74 healthy controls) using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme. The results show that our proposed method can obtain an accuracy of 93.10% for SZ identification. By comparison, our method is more effective for SZ identification than some existing methods."

176167177,"I can’t think straight about myself because the voices are always tearing me down. So I’m on the defensive. Back before this, I felt fine about myself. I’m funny, affectionate, love cuddling and being close to people, love being close to boyfriends and friends (personal intimacy, through shared experiences), fairly intelligent though not the smartest (maybe 50th percentile among friends), care about others and the plight of the less fortunate. All in all I feel pretty good about myself if I remember far back before the abuse started."

Before, each time I went off my medications, I went to the hospital. So, now, I take my medication daily. I noticed someone here is doing translating from Korean to English! Very good!! I know another language too and do minor medical translations but have never done it as my main work yet. Now, I am thinking about doing medical translation and writing. I have a background in the medical field so am familiar with the medical terminology.

I have been starting to have suicidal ideation and I’m afraid people are targeting me. I just wrote this whole story about the illuminati because I triggered myself about things that happened, and connected everything into a story that makes it seem like the illuminati is after me but that’s not really true I don’t know the truth. I do not want to watch any conspiracy videos. I am sick of politics, conspiracy theories and everything. Information overload. But I just want to feel sane again. And I don’t feel like the Aristada injections or the Strattera or Topamax are bringing me closer to sanity or rationality I think they’re making me sicker.

176167195,You’re close to the withdrawals being over. Melatonin wasn’t strong enough for me as I also had restless leg syndrome. Hydroxyzine and clonodine work well but require a prescription. Hydroxyzine is like Benadryl on steroids (just a real strong Benadryl) so I would suggest taking a Benadryl
174384808,I am not a doctor but I think the TD is worse cuz it’s somewhat easier to hide positive symptoms from other people than the TD.

176167229,"Hello there. Eleven days ago I made a post on here about a medication change I’d had to go through. I’m new to this forum, but in a nutshell, I’d been on Amisulpride (Solian and Sulprix after 2016) since 2006, and have been well/medicated for a while. My psychiatrist had prescribed me Vraylar due to, as she told me, its lower side effects of weight gain and sedation. Granted, we’re all different and this point should always be remembered, but, it just wasn’t for me. I felt I was borderline relapsing and my mood/mind wasn’t as stable as I’ve been used to whatsoever. After a chat with my doc, she changed the medication to Risperidone, and so far so good. To be honest, better than good. I’m told it’s supposed to take about a month before its effects are fully known. It’s been in my system for a week and a half and I’ve not had any Amisulpride for the same period of time. In past months, because I’ve needed to ship Amisulpride to my home, (I’m in the US, it’s not fully FDA a
pproved - yet) on a couple of occasions the package has been delayed. Anyway, point is, from past experience, after this amount of time I’d be experiencing some symptoms from being without the Amisulpride - nothing, yet. The sedation however, is real lol. It wiped me out the first morning after the night before, but my doc is happy with me taking it in the morning with my regular coffee as I’ve been well several years (at least I think that’s her reason). I haven’t noticed any weight gain yet but yeah, the sedation is still a thing even waking up the following day. However, it’s not too much worse than while I was taking Amisulpride in the morning so I can live with that. It has also increased my motivation around the house which my wife has been thrilled with lol. Plus, I’m now questioning if I’d had some anhedonia in recent years because I’m finding a lot more enjoyment in already enjoyable activities. Because this is relevant from the last post, CBD smokable hemp did help. It alleviated som
e of the chaos Vraylar brought me. (cannabis/high THC abuse many years ago was the catalyst for my own illness) Again, we’re all individuals and that’s part of the problem with mental health treatments regardless - because as I’ve read, Vraylar works with some folks, but unfortunately not with others - It just wasn’t for me. On a slightly different topic, I know I’m lucky to be more stable/well these days, but years ago I was a complete mess. I recognize that now. Over the years I stuck with nightly amisulpride and in time it did its thing. I can understand how some of y’all aren’t there yet. But keep the faith. I appreciate how awful our illnesses can be, I really do. BUT, don’t ever give up. I’m just trying to offer some positivity as I’ve realized recently that’s what makes the difference. Plus, I guess I’ve lived an interesting life and seen a few things lol. So offering my personal perspective by saying life always gets better. Just give yourselves that chance. Thanks for reading, 
I have a tendency to ramble lol."

176167237,Good wishes to you. Keep us updated! I am currently on latuda and am stable and doing well. I had severe jaw clenching for a while and benzotrap and antanex did not help but it just went away by itself when my body was used to it perhaps.

176167243,"Your doctor told you that maybe you wanted to kill? Did he just throw that in there as part of the conversation? Do you have urges to kill and fight? I like to fight, before I had bad knees I took shotokan and Jiu-Jitsu. Sometimes I would hunt. These things helped me be in touch with my primal side."

176167251,LS! I am 62 years old and trying to achieve a better physique. I exercise daily for the last two and a half years. But I just get stronger all of the time without getting to look much better. I can see in the gym that I am one of the strongest there. I do a leg extension with 134 kilo (300lbs) and a pec deck with 134 kilo (300lbs). According to the website Strengthlevel I have elite fitness for my weight (300 lbs) and age.
176167252,Thanks. It’s been worse lately.
176167253,Nice job! congrats!
174384822,"There’s a murder in my country and I’m worrying so much about it being blamed to mental illness/ schizophrenia. I’m worried about a riot starting. I’m worried about people watching me. When murders committed by schizophrenic people were occurring, people were talking about locking them up and tracking them via government systems. I feel like I’m not wanted and now people are going to hate everyone with schizophrenia, fill the internet with hatred, and blame me with crimes I did not commit. I’m scared. Horrified. Terrified. I’m worried about people finding out that I have schizophrenia and I’m worried about my parents abandoning me. I’m worried that my townspeople are going to find out that I’m schizophrenic and beat me up and accuse my mother with horrible _USER_ID_. I’m worried about the state locking me up and putting me into prison, beating me up, accusing me of terrible crimes. I’m worried about people knowing my thoughts. I am afraid that people are going to know that I
’m schizophrenic and think that I’m going to harm people. I am afraid that people are going to beat me, abandon me, punish me, bury me alive, and yell at me with hatred and anger. I’m scared of people. I’m so scared of living. I don’t want to be buried alive. I don’t want to be hated. I don’t want to be accused of crimes I did not commit. I was thinking about hanging myself in the mountains or something so that I could protest against the _USER_ID_ and tell them that I am not dangerous. I thought suicide was the only way to catch someone’s attention and tell them that we’re not dangerous people. I am NOT DANGEROUS!!! I AM NOT DANGEROUS AND STOP ACCUSING ME OF CRIMES! Don’t even think about locking me up. I want someone to kill me to prove that I’m not dangerous."

176167274,I would fast for 5 days…sometimes 10 days at a time. I did this for a while…one day I had a psychotic break.

176167276,"So I still need to consult with another mathematician, my question is too vague for math.stackexchange, so I’m going to ask a friend. I need to frame and write up my question in LaTeX and email it to him. Not sure when I will do this. Thank you."
176167277,"Thats pretty typical. They don’t know where you were verse how you are now. There’s also a phase where symptoms begin to show, so they might think you’ve just naturally gotten lazy. I was working my ass off at work every day enthusiastically and my mom still acts like I’m a pos who should get off his butt “if he’s bored” now that I’m not working. As though I’ve the energy to work and do chores all day, tell her to look it up and that the disease causes this, and I get a blank stare. Its like nothing is getting to her about this being my new reality."
176167278,Yes Yes (to some extent) No 0 voters Two times I was involuntarily hospitalised.
176167279,I prefer prebiotics by far
176167280,HA! That would be a pretty awesome shirt
176167281,Haven’t touched the stuff for probably forty years.
174384838,These are massive amount of l-theanine dose per day. No wonder your positive symptoms coming back as your body get used to this massive dosage and tolerance build to it requiring more and more dose to feel same effect. I suggest you to slowly taper this l theanine dose. It may require you to change your psych medicine but remaining in these massive dose is not the proper way to manage positive symptoms…
174384828,Yeah therapists don’t know much about severe mi like bipolar and schizophrenia. My therapist doesn’t have a clue and she’s a PhD psychologist. This is typical.
176167282,"That’s true, and I’ve seen other people make that mistake before on the forum. But the awareness of double bookkeeping sustained over a long period of time - in fact, chronic in my case - leads to a self-presentation which is hard to distinguish from psychosis with insight. But yes, they are definitely not the same thing."
174384831,"I have a hard time watching anything including YouTube videos. Anything that runs on electricity basically lol. I prefer books right now or just doing nothing like smoking cigarettes, thinking, and doing the very basics in life. I am convinced (at least today) that I’m a paranoid schizophrenic who does not hallucinate at all. Am I high functioning? Not sure. I cannot hold a job or go to school. I’m not interested anyways; at least because of what happened to me at the Library a few years back. I gave it my all and I nearly lost my soul and will to live. Basically, I either dream or have dreams while awake where I remember other lives where I was an ‘actor’ or something for lack of a better term. I literally think that these tv shows we are watching are actually real or based on reality in other dimensions or parallel universes. Is this strange? Hell ya it is! I don’t think I was ever an actor. I would never want to be one. But I constantly think about philosophy, existence, and the mind. 
Like how do people come up with ideas and TV shows and music? I feel like they are getting them from other dimensions, AI programs, or their own minds but that those thoughts or creative insights (even among others) are coming from a different reality. Like I have _NAME_ and crap when I watch TV shows and movies. Like even the fictional ones are based on different realities. Anyone else feel like this? These thoughts don’t cause discomfort but I’m curious if any other schizophrenics have similar thoughts and beliefs? Since taking my medications, the intensity of such beliefs has decreased about 80-90%. As some of you may know, I have a delusion that I’ve lived billions of ‘past lives’ in other dimensions and stuff…I’m trying to get over it. I sometimes have the delusion that I’m an extraterrestrial or a ‘vampire’. The medication helps and since stopping the energy drinks these thoughts have basically resolved on their own. I’ve heard of the Illuminati in a past life. I’m pretty scared 
I guess. I don’t like them. I think I hate them. I’m trying to be a Christian. Like I just ‘found’ a video on YouTube where _PERSON_ explains that aliens can project their consciousness into space at the speed of light and travel/transfer it into new bodies. I’ve been talking about this for years. They say it would take like 100 years for humans to do it. I seriously don’t think I’m much different from other humans, except that I’ve been experimented on and ????. And maybe these people are ‘stealing my ideas’, although I have much respect for the great genius and scientist _PERSON_. The video came out a few days ago. I’ve been having crazy dreams (lucid?) or sleep walking and stuff where I’m talking to ‘strange people’. Nobody knows about it or thinks it is real. I think they could be Men in Black or something. Like they could be aliens or androids. I’m not afraid anymore. Technically, I suffer from insanity, but at the same time, I’ve told my story here over the years and how 
much I’ve suffered. I’ve had nothing but respect for you guys and have had tremendous support. And without this forum, I think I would hate myself more. I just hope people don’t believe me, I guess. Because if it was true, I would be some kind of lab rat or guinea pig. Thank You!"

You post longer than average too!! haha. I think I understand the dissociative aspect of love/sex. Digging super deep: is that I think the latter has a lot of stuff like power and control, some people are submissive sometimes, while some are dominating sometimes, and it’s the pact we iron out non verbally to never analyze it, or describe these “bedroom politics?” to every last person. It’s THAT perhaps that allows for Love to form? I dunno. I may have been abused emotionally and thinking circularly and ad nauseum might be a symptom of that."

176167302,It started a couple of weeks ago. I was needing to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes all weekend. At first I thought if was the winter vomiting bug but it has continued all this last week. Stress totally sets it off. After a good period last month I started isolating again. As a result things have gotten unstable and my ibs has demonstrated this. When I thought I had the winter sickness bug I cancelled a nurse appointment 24 hours beforehand. Since then my unstable mind has decided I have been released from the care of my nurse. I am so anxious about this. Have left some messages but no reply as yet. I start isolating because I perceive the outside world as a huge stressor. Unfortunately isolating is an equal stressor which promotes loss of insight into my fears. Am not sure what to do

176167313,Getting kicked off. Not filling out reviews correctly. Especially if they’re going to be more frequent.
176167314,"I have really mixed feelings on The Tears. I like some of their songs but they’re very hit and miss. The album feels clunky to me. Songs I really like : Autograph, Fallen Idol, Brave New Century, Lovers, A Love As Strong As Death, Songs I strongly dislike : Beautiful Pain (annoying chorus/middle, lovely verses), Imperfection Songs I neither like or strongly dislike : the rest Some of their Bsides are really good. I like: Low Life, Because You’re Worthless, Song For The Migrant Worker, Southern Rain I’m really glad they patched things up and did a reunion album. Its every Suede fan’s dream. But ultimately I dunno. It leaves a little to be desired. The overall production sound is really unique and fantastic. _NAME_’s Slow Attack and Black Rainbows are really worth listening to. I played them to death when they were new. His first two are a bit dire IMO. I liked them enough when they came out but as soon as Slow Attack came out I realised they’re awful cheap sounding records with a lot of 
dodgy lyrics and I was just fanboying. That said I knew they weren’t gems, but I didn’t realise how bad they were."

176167330,"Talk to your doctor before using buPROPiontogether with escitalopram. Combining these medications may increase the risk of seizures, which may occur rarely with either medication. In addition, buPROPion can increase the blood levels of escitalopram, which may increase other side effects. You may be more likely to experience seizures with these medications if you are elderly, undergoing alcohol or drug withdrawal, have a history of seizures, or have a condition affecting the central nervous system such as a brain tumor or head trauma."
176167331,That’s a really bad idea. St. _NAME_’s Wort is way more risky than an antidepressant and way less regulated.
176167332,Yea you can lift weights we don’t care
176167333,I agree with _AT_MENTION_
176167334,"If you think of it in terms of a mood stabilizer rather than a diet does that help? It’s helping me. The way she explained it is if you eat food that the body needs to break down to get at the sugar, like whole grains and fibrous foods like fruits and veggies the sugars go into your system slowly and therefore you have a slow steady stream of energy, no spikes. When you take in processed sugar, the body gets an immediate spike followed by a dip and that’s where you get your _USER_ID_ moods and crashes. I know we all know this already but when she put this in these terms as it relates to my moods, I all of a sudden correlated it to my mental health for the first time. Sugar is bad for my mental health, not to mention my body. I don’t know it’s helping me to think of it in those terms."
176167335,I was put on 75mg of Effexor (increasing to 150mg monday) by my pdoc. He said it was a good antidepressant. Anyone have any experience with this med?
176167336,This post hits home with me… all the ???????? ways people behave… and I just never was able to understand why. Really it’s the small minds that behave so lowly… they lack empathy and are entirely self-centered. It get’s easier when you can recognize who’s what.

174384860,"I got a psychosis a year ago. I didn’t have hallucinations but I had delusions that people wanted to fight me and aggression towards my parents only. I got off antipsychotics 17 or 18 days ago. Was on them for a year. I haven’t had a relapse in smyptoms. I still have anhedonnia, low motivation, avolition and emotional numbness. I want to be put on an maoi and memantine but I can only do so by getting on an antipsychotic because I’m scared that if I take an maoi and memantine, I’ll get another psychosis. I want to go on an maoi and memantine because they’re good for negative symptoms. SSRIs worsen anhedonia. Most of the people in my anhedonia facebook group got their anhedonia from ssris. One of the things I hate most in this world are antipsychotics. I despise them. They made my negative symptoms infinitely worse when I got on them."

174384845,"Well if you are supposed to love yourself then you have to find a way to love your schizophrenia. My voices are either energy parasites that siphon off all of my stamina by getting me worked up causing a mild to severe adrenaline spike depending on the intensity of my voices and then leaving me alone when the adrenaline plummets. OR my voices are kind and they teach me things like how to block the worst ones out without medication. I KNOW that the voices are not yours or anyone else’s but mine and if I choose to appreciate the beauty of the good ones as long as I don’t act on anything I’m not hurting anyone and I’m actually helping myself in appreciating the only beautiful thing to come from this experience. It is my experience and I don’t care what ANYONE says. I know what I heard and felt and I know that the story will continue with or without the portion that was given to me. I’ve said it before… God is going to have to talk to someone about His plan… Why can’t it be us? Becaus
e some of you all don’t believe. This post will probably get flagged for triggering people or something but I stand by my belief that the voices that were once in the literal hundreds in a day are now mostly gone because they’re almost done with me. God, wouldn’t that be nice if my voices were telling the truth? but a short time to a God is an eternity to a human. “Almost done” could be a year or the rest of my life in God years so I wait and I listen. No action just 100% curiosity carrying me through this. Before I was schizophrenic I always wanted to know what the voices say to people who hear. Now that I hear them they are a part of me and I refuse to hate anything about my beautiful mind. And YES I’M ON MY MEDS and they’re working just fine so go ahead and delete this or whatever it is you like to do to posts that don’t conform to YOUR belief system."

Just give it your all every once in a while and you’ll be avoiding any kind of wasting. I think the reason it doesn’t happen to me is that I tend to walk around my apartment anyway during the day and workout when I feel weak. You could try that.

176167463,"Im in the USA, also it was the first time I’ve ever gone to the police about anything. I suppose I could try for a restraining order now like my therapist suggested but I just think it would be a big hassle at this point since its been a few years since hes left gifts at my doorstep or written me letters. And I blocked his number so theres no new creepy texts. But besides all that he happens to live three doors down from me. So avoiding him even with a restraining order would be hard. His new methods of bothering me are so sly, last year he walked past our house loudly humming happy birthday on my birthday, and I know it wasnt me since my grandma is the one who pointed it out. Id love to just move but im in a bad spot for that. My main issue with him right now is that every time I walk to the store or go outside in general he always seems to be there and crosses the street to walk on the same side as me.

lace as his persistent declarations of love and gifts started around the same time things got bad enough for me to be diagnosed. He would do things like follow me home on his bike at night and sneak up behind me while I walked home from work. And I think the stress from that is what made things worse in a way."

176167475,"Day 30 of my Daily Essential Nutrients I feel even more grounded now. Able to have conversations in front of the muted TV without adding things to the “crazy narrative”. Just living in objective reality with a mostly-functioning noise filter again. 3 days ago I had a relapse and had to start taking low dose Haldol for my headache that was spiralling out of control after I ate some walnuts that messed me up badly. I suspected I was allergic to them but this really cemented that fact. Now I am okay, on 0.5 mg Haldol morning and night. I can’t seem to handle milk, even in small quantities, so I’m having to switch to something plant-based, like hemp milk. Gonna try that out. Not masochistic enough for black coffee and tea. I ate a Resveratrol after the headache out of fear that things were going backwards, but I seem to be OK now. I don’t think Resveratrol will be a fixture, as it seems to complicate the regimen (and D.E.N. alone is like 12 capsules a day , don’t really want to add to that.
) Another thing I’m doing that seems to be helping is getting low ORP water from an alkaline water machine. My machine is kind of busted, where at the strongest setting it says it gives 10.4 pH water at less than -600 ORP, but as measured with other tools it ends up being like 7.8 pH with -250 ORP. This is somewhat anti-inflammatory so I try to use that in my coffee and tea, and as straight water. I’d say easily 80% of my day-to-day progress is due to D.E.N. though. Two things I noticed though, it’s low in Potassium and Folic acid, so if you could get extra supplementation for those you’ll have the all the broad spectrum nutrients you need. I was noticing feeling really mopey before supplementing 1 mg Folic acid, now I feel more like an emotionally stable man. Just like that. So, my current regimen is 4 capsules Daily Essential Nutrients 3x a day, 0.5 mg Haldol 2x a day, Folic Acid 1mg 1x a day, Potassium Citrate 1/2 tsp 1x a day. Very pleased with it so far. Not 100% out of the woods yet though. Say, 
60-70%?"
176167476,"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-27-it-turns-out-fifa-is-ideal-for-teaching-mental-health-patients-about-resilience “If FIFA is so good for us, what should we do about it?” I asked. “Let’s have a tournament,” he said. “We can make posters for it. And you can bring us in popcorn and chocolate and snacks. And a prize.” So we did it. We got a whole bunch of staff and patients to work together. We got permission to use the big projector in the conference room. It felt like an old-school LAN party, lights down low, snacks everywhere, people oohing and ahhing. It created a close little community of activity, gave people real, tangible goals and engaged them in a common cause in a completely organic way. I felt like I was watching this beautiful thing spreading roots. As time passed, FIFA continued to be the most popular game on the ward, and the one that I most often picked when trying to engage with somebody new. People who initially struggled to engage with each other became fri
ends, people who felt isolated found common ground, people with distressing symptoms found moments of respite. That irresistible blend of accessibility, therapeutic value and fun helped me to initiate meaningful dialogue with many people that would otherwise have kept to themselves. It really is a beautiful game. FIFA is an awesome game. The article also talks about the resilience you learn from the game. I can see how it would make you more confident."
174384892,Here’s the thing. It’s a game of give or take. 20 years ago people here complained about positive and negative symptoms. Side effects were an issue but not the primary concern. These days side effects have a more profound affect on people’s minds around these boards. Side effects are very real and I deal with them daily but for me it’s not even an issue. The price I pay is decent frame of mind and less positives. I can live with that. If your worried about taking meds for the side effects without giving them a go you’ve got it all wrong. I’m not saying they can’t be deal breakers because they can…I’m just saying give meds a go.

Public speaking is not something I have previously enjoyed or felt I could do. I do not wish to characterise speaking on _NAME_ more important than my sisters wedding but it was a dream of mine. But to go back to what you said, when I truly reflect upon how I was able to do that and why I wanted to (speaking as someone who is I introverted, reserved and shy) was because I felt imprisoned and I needed to get out. I do not know you but just from what you write I believe many people may be able to learn from you and if you feel like I did, perhaps sharing your story and your experience may help set you free and the many who are o strained by a closed mind."

Im better now, almost zero psychosis. in the midst of it all i have ocd, ptsd and a mild autism. I’ll talk to my psychiatrist about all this. This is my outburst."

Time travel is a widely recognized concept in philosophy and fiction. The idea of a time machine was popularized by _PERSON_ 1895 novel The Time Machine. It is uncertain if time travel to the past is physically possible. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of... So i was watching the netflix series called travellers, its a show about time travellers. Anyways it got me thinking about how time travel works again. The only type of time travel i slightly understand is the light based one. Where if you go to a certain distance away from Earth, say millions of miles, youll be able to see the Earth from how it looked when it was old. Just like how light images move at a certain speed, you would be able to send possible signals if someone had le
arned how to calculate perfectly the time and place in space to be able to send the signal. I had been discussing different time travel theories with my friend and we argue alot about how it isnt possible to insert yourself into a past image of light even if you went from point A to point B then back to point A faster than the speed of light, you would have lost any time it takes to travel at that speed. I still disagree with him and think that if you were to do that previous example of travel, youd be able to go back in time depending on how far you went back the light image is slower than you. Idk tho, maybe i should think of other types of time travel. I used the example to explain how you see those pictures of olden days with people holding smart phones. This type of time travel may be only used to travel backwards in time."

I didnt want to really give an example. I already told you guys a lot over the years. No need to talk about it again.

174384976,"It’s good to go into a doctors appt with goals. For agitation, medication helped me. Zoloft, an SSRI, was the absolute best but I couldn’t stay on it for other reasons. I am now on depakote and no longer get the intense agitation I used to. Many psych meds will help treat agitation. Thought broadcasting is a delusion and therefore would be best treated with an AP which work good for positive symptoms. Boredom and lack of motivation there is not much a pdoc can do about. There are currently no meds to treat negative symptoms out there. What has helped me most is making things routine means I do not need as much motivation to do them it is just habit. So push yourself really hard for a couple weeks to do things and then you will find it doesn’t require half the effort anymore to do. For boredom you may need to make entertainment a habit too if you don’t have the motivation to do it or else find some new hobbies and ways to structure your time. Social anxiety can be treated with propranolol. H
owever if you are put on a mood med like an ssri for agitation that may help improve it as well. The voices are a positive symptom and once again an AP is best for that. Note that sometimes an AP won’t be able to perfectly get rid of all your symptoms: I still get voices and hallucinations and delusional thoughts on occasion, but they are very mild, infrequent and I do not get absorbed in them anymore. Lots of other people this is the case for them too. It’s nice to have a goal for yourself to be completely rid of symptoms but that may not be realistic. If you are on a med currently and it is working well enough to where your symptoms aren’t super distressing and distracting and affect your functioning anymore, you probably want to stick with that med. It’s ok if you still have some symptoms as long as you don’t find them seriously distressing or debilitating."
176167742,"The only pdoc I spoke to about my problems diagnosed me as SzA. I was in a hospital psych ward back in 2008, and came out with a paranoid Sz diagnosis.

I’ve seen tall whites (just flashes/visions) and apparently they can run like 40 miles an hour (like flash) and ???? so there’s no telling if they’re human or non human entities and then I heard some super soldiers can run faster and even slow down time/stop time. For me, I think I was essentially killed, cloned, and had my consciousness uploaded to a computer by dark, esoteric satanic forces. Sort of like the mystery schools/Illuminati. I feel like the whole government is in on it. It’s very scary for me. That’s why I cannot work and function. Not because of schizophrenia really. I might have been a super soldier but really don’t know. I might have MPD/DID instead of schizophrenia (true schizophrenia that is) but I don’t know. I do watch videos that confirm my beliefs and don’t necessarily copy their ideas. It’s sort of a discovery process. I don’t really like posting such things, but in my original timeline/life I got ‘sick’ and stuff in colleg
e around 2011. Since then, I have lived billions or millions of lives since then of all types and varieties mostly traumatic and horrific. Super soldiers should be called super victims of the government/Illuminati/and Aliens in my opinion. We aren’t soldiers and get no help or benefits of any kind. Just ridicule and trauma. Basically, I was heavily targeted in college in 2011ish and figured it’s because of facebook. I was being watched. There was a lot of reasons actually not just facebook. Never knew or figured out why. I wanted to be an investment banker or military guy. Since then, I have had so much trauma and stuff as an adult and the only light at the end of the tunnel is Christ FOR ME. I don’t know why I post this sometimes. I’m pretty much not taken seriously and cannot get proper help. I feel like we live in a fallen world and evil world and it’s on the whole planet, not just here in America. And yes, I love and always loved my country. The real enemy/evil are the people doing this to innoc
ent people. Makes me think I created bitcoin or something in my original lives among other various things. That I posted I was _NAME_ also but that was a past life. Sometimes I feel like just giving up on here and posting memes. It’s really been a media blackout and huge coverup since I started talking."

He based his whole therapeutic approach on getting his clients to have a little fun on occasion. And I agree with him. I know it sounds trivial and that our problems are extremely serious and even a matter of life or death but using myself as an example I know how constant worrying and focusing on the negative takes it’s toll and wears you down. Maybe it’s better to ignore this post of mine and forget about it. But maybe if you are in the position to get out for a walk or go out to eat in a restaurant when there’s only a few people in it or go for a hike or take a walk downtown and window shop or go to a free museum or art gallery or sit on your porch and sip a soda and watch the people walk by and maybe say “hello” or go out for coffee etc. I mean stuff like this helped in my recovery (but not all the time). To answer your questio
n, maybe doing some of this will stimulate your senses and challenge you and at least give you a minutes relief from worrying and get you to focus on something besides your problems and it would be even better if you focused on other people besides focusing on yourself. I know that just focusing on myself can be a problem sometimes. Anyways! Like I said, ignore this or maybe take something from it. Good luck."

176167809,i dont want to acoplish anything today. i will accoplish next month everything.
176167810,I don’t make much money on it. But I’d like to provide my son with much more than this. I chose to become a mother and he shouldn’t have to suffer or struggle because I am ill. I want to have more for him. I also want to do it for myself of course. I’m an ambitious person and won’t stop fighting to have better for us. I’m just wondering if I am in school and it doesn’t work out will I have to start all over again.
176167811,"My personal hell is that no meds I have ever tried have worked to alleviate the constant onslaught of attacks from other people’s spirits and attachments or demons, whatever you would like to call them. Last night I was told I chose this to be tested by God and that it isn’t real. I feel like other people I see or think of (or if they think of me) immediately hover over me and take control. And if I fight it gets worse and my cells vibrate. So I can relate to the feeling of having no full autonomy."
176167812,Very nice. There is an innocence about the girl. Floating out in an open space. Total freedom.
176167813,"What you want to hear and what you need to hear are very different things. Taking positive steps now to deal with it, is far,far better than struggling to regain a previous level of functioning due to one or more relapses."

176167816,"Tomorrow my counselor will help me with what to say. My last day… I’m finding that the high functioning group was much more receptive to what I was saying about recovery. Women in the low functioning group almost unanimously don’t befriend me and even many guys don’t think my improvement applies to them. But last week in the high functioning group we had a boat metaphor activity and I talked about being lost at sea with only my friend to guide me. But this week my mentality is finally better and my cognition is better too. I said my image changed. I see land. It’s night time and there’s lights on shore where my friends and family and maybe new relationships are waiting for me. It’s getting late, but I see that I will get there in time and have more journeys out to sea again. I think I will incorporate this into my speech. Instead of talking so much about what I did, I’ll talk about avoiding my problems by being outside and active everyday. I needed to find balance with my internal l
ife through art, finding what I love, and developing a sense of self and purpose again."

176167819,"Hey. I wasn’t here last night, but I want to reassure you that it’s normal to have a whole host of morbid thoughts when you’re watching someone you love suffer so much, and you know the end is near. It’s also normal to feel guilty about those thoughts, but you have no reason to beat yourself up."

176167824,"If think of do something then some thought come. What thought before vanished from mind. If think of do some thing then used mobile for checking some thing. Not only forgot about previous what to do but also forgot about if there anything to do after using mobile. There is an useful application for this kind of memory issue. For example at morning when alarm rings urge to sleep again is there but here is the trick, use your mobile for few seconds like play some small game like lumosity game after few minutes the urge to sleep again vanished! This way can use this to get rid of all negative thoughts, urges etc if want."

176167828,How do i do it?
176167829,Wow Clozaril for me was the ONLY med that did the trick for me. I initially tried about 4 or 5 without luck Maybe your psychiatrist can make a combo to help get those hallucinations away?
176167830,"Thank you, I do appreciate the words of encouragement. I feel caffeine is okay, in terms of exercise. I have to admit. The weights that I had been lifting for awhile now, during the stress of university I’ve basically for the last month - hardly lifted. The effects of the above is all too obvious now that I think on it. Maybe the tiredness is just over exertion and it’s eating motivation."
176167831,"I’m in the process of furnishing a house on an EXTREME budget. I find rugs are a good solution for dingy carpets. Look for furniture outlet stores.

176167834,I heard that wealthy people are generally only slightly happier that less affluent people. When I was in a private psychiatric hospital for a year I was struck by how many people had trust funds. They were very wealthy and very miserable.

176167836,Basically they ask if you like potato and decide if you are paranoid or not depending on your answer. They rarely assess yoru situation according to what you respond about so yo don’t need to prepare unless you wonder about something specifically.

They left it one week before deciding not to wait any longer, I am furious. I have told them no I am not going as last time I went to one I had a relapse and stopped my medication because the deceitful assessor completely ignored me and said I didn’t need help. This is such a corrupt system. The DVLA took 5 months to get the information needed to make a decision, but the DWP won’t wait a week."

174385006,"This makes a lot of sense although I believe is the similar argument with marijauna or amphetamines. If marijuana causes psychosis why are most people who smoke marijuana not psychotic? Some say that marijuana only causes psychosis in people prone to psychosis others say psychosis is not only schizophrenia but is a state of dysregulated dopamine, analogous to a state like low mood. _PERSON_ (_PERSON_) argues that Schizophrenia should rather be called a case of “chronic psychosis”. Basically that given the right conditions it would cause psychosis in most people."

176167851,"We think that,there is no animal model of sz ,the matter is just a dancing with words to imprint a false facts in the minds of the readers ! in reality,the animal must be used only to test the effect of medication on the biochemistry of the brain (the biological health ) before using the medication by human being -no more ( Mainly,if you do not know what is sz is in itself , how to made the sz in animal or else ) If the sz is just a Behavior Symptoms as you think and nothing else ? You said"" …most of which encode motor proteins that move materials throughout the cells"" In reality,the problem is the knowledge material which transmitted by the transmitter exposed to ideological change after all receptors received all the transmitters messages ( the cognitive material is protected and coded in the transmitter structure ) it means,the cognitive material ( the massage of meaning/data/ ideas/the mental concept )is not the chemical materials themselves that move throughout the brain cells !!"

176167856,most people in my generation i have noticed do not get married they just live together and have a kid or kids. but also i read a case study the other day that said that most men if they are diagnosed before age 25 never marry in their life so you have some luck with you being a woman. i was just talking to my neighbor the other day who is a single mom of 2 and then i heard from some other people a few days later stories about people who are in relationships and they treat each other like crap… for instance like physical abuse and beating and stuff or cheating or just not really having any form of connection between to the two. and it started to make me think that for most people that i hear about unless your a bad candidate for a spouse or being in a relationship you dont get married because a lot of people who are like that seek out people so they can do that kind of bad things. im sure theres still some couples out there that are normal and good to each other. but also i was told by a therapist 
years ago that the divorce rate is extremely high for our generation and most people who get married divorce after a few years or so. and i have seen this happen even locally.
174385001,The best way to keep prevent suicide is to make sure you take your medication and that your honest with your doctors. What you can also do is have crises numbers ready and use them when your feeling suicidal it helps to have someone to talk to in an emergency. Next dont isolate and make friends and interact with people your less likely to feel suicidal if you maintain healthy close relationships. Avoid depressants like drugs and alcohol as well.

176167858,Usually ppl realize before like 18 what their sexual orientation is?? I don’t think you’re gay. I don’t think anyone’s 100% straight but I can’t say for sure but I think you were just second guessing yourself because what this girl says. You’re most likely heterosexual ???? what she thinks. Only u can say what u are anyways. I became curious a little in other things at 24 but I still call myself heterosexual my sexuality only turns bisexual like 5% of my life. Then usually I’m heterosexual. But before 24 It was all heterosexual impulses. But then came a slightly bisexual side but nothing like becoming gay all of a sudden and it’s moreso just porn I like I’ve never felt attracted to anyone but girls I met irl. So Idk. I’m straight but we all question a little

176167873,"They ask about all medical conditions because if you have a flare-up of ANY medical condition, they’re required to respond. Mental illness is just one category.

Well last night my son in law said he was headed over there to see if he could stay there for a while, I needed to talk to him so I facebooked her and what happened next was unbelievable. She ripped me a new one for my “whore daughter” stealing her man when she stayed with her and for me never to contact her again. I said I’m sorry I had no idea and she went on to explain that it was the first man she had in 20 years and my daughter stole him the 2 weeks she stayed with them. This is the guy my daughter left her family for. The guy that’s 10 years older that her and has a history of drug use. And from what I can tell is still using and is now getting my daughter back into using too. Anyway she’s burning her bridges but burning mine too and I don’t appreciate it.

I don’t think you need to think about it like that. If you do something well and better than something that may already exist, you can win people over that way perhaps? I don’t think you give yourself enough credit. I’d love to have a skillset in that area, but my education was patchy at best and I was never encouraged to work on things like that here. I don’t know your history, but it took 6 AP’s for me to stabilise, and I got away with not being put on Clozapine, as my view is that is last chance situation, and if that doesn’t work your ?????? basically. Try switching it up if you have not tried already. There should in most cases be a drug that can help in some way - that’s the hope anyway I have for everyone with this illness"

IF there had been a change What is kind of change ? When will it happen ? What are the change’s mechanisms that occur in the data concept ?

Maybe someone should come up with a dating site called datingcrazy.com ! Lol I’m just kidding on the name, but some kind of dating site for the ill!

I usually have phone calls to make or appointments but I also have stuff like going to the park for a walk or going to my sisters or just miscellaneous things. The COVID-19 is stopping me from doing much else but a I can do my share of the chores, get up early and go shopping and then cook a pot of stew or chili or beans to last me a week. Use your imagination, be creative. I know it’s a cliché but force yourself to have fun. Even if you only do one big thing a day it’s better than nothing. But yeah, write down a few things you like and schedule them in and you can write down surf the web too and taking a nap or going for a walk. I’m not be

However, it is very unlikely we’ll meet other beings as advanced as us due to the sheer size of the universe. My understanding of the future of the universe is that it’ll continue expanding. It will follow the 2nd law of thermodynamics where everything will degrade in into non-specific chaotic forms, and all heat will dissipate until the universe becomes unimaginably cold and devoid of light.

A retrospective study. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The International journal of social psychiatry , Jan 2020 06 To examine the risk of past and current experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV) in women with severe mental illness (SMI) in pregnancy.We examined past and current experiences of IPV in women with SMI in pregnancy. The data of 304 women with SMI including schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders and Bipolar Disorder meeting International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) criteria were extracted from hospital records at King _NAME_ Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. Comparisons were made between our study data and the Australian population data reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which included data on pregnant women in Western Australia. Additional mea
sures included reported demographics, substance use and pregnancy variables.Around 48% of pregnant women with SMI had experienced IPV and were three times the risk when compared with the general pregnant population in Australia. There was no difference in rates of IPV in those women with psychotic disorders when compared with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, the rates of smoking and illicit substance use were significantly higher in pregnant women with SMI who experienced IPV compared with those who have not experienced IPV.These findings suggest women with SMI in pregnancy are at significantly higher risk of having experienced or experiencing IPV. In addition, IPV in pregnant women with SMI may increase the risk of smoking and illicit substance use. Together this suggests that maternity and mental health services should ensure there are both screening and support pathways for IPV that are developed and evaluated specifically for pregnant women with SMI."

I think the last time I was at actually at a Social Security office was more than 6 years ago. There was a mix-up with my benefits and someone with the same name as me went to prison in Louisiana and they stopped my benefits because they thought it was me and you can’t collect benefits while in prison. So it involved calling back East to the prison and finding the right person to talk to. Believe me, it got complicated so my older sister stepped in. I thought I could handle it but when my sister came with me she grilled the worker who had my case and discovered many flaws and mis
handling and just plain incompetence and laziness from the worker. My problem with authority is that I trust it too much. But my sister has been around and she asks the tough questions and is not afraid of confrontations. Yeah, family support or even just a friend."

176168046,I think the can do attitude is good but if someone does not get to ‘higher functioning’ state whilst using the can do attitude does that mean they didn’t apply the can do attitude ‘correctly’?

176168047,"I had grief/loss in spades for a couple of years recently. It put me in a depression. I got out of the depression with the help of a psychologist, but still had to deal with the loss. It was time that eventually helped, my grief slowly turned into a resolve (and occasional anger). I still have bouts of grief, but they are less common and don’t last as long. Maybe look up ways to deal with loss and grief online? That might help speed up the process."

176168050,One of my nieces habitually clobbers me in chess. I remember my last game with my Dad in chess. His mind was going due to cancer but his instincts were still just enough there to defeat me. He did not know he had won and was insulted by the idea of mating between relatives when I said he had me in checkmate. I didn’t mind losing those games.

176168062,OK sorry _AT_MENTION_. I thought you were seriously insulting me but you were just joking. It just shocked me that you would call me that because I have had zero problems with you before and so that caught me by surprise.

176168085,"I love my descendants, my family and my ancestors, there is something synchronous about two divided countries, split down the middle, coming together in faith, my teacher could teach all faiths, but that requires both experience and understanding. My ancestor was a janisserie who rebelled and his son was a kleftis boss up in the mountains with a big knife he used to steal sheep. I already know most of the books and verses by heart if not by memory. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ are my favourite poets. Ireland, Senegambia and Cyprus are all divided, but with different histories, Britain seems to be going that way with Scotland. There is a fantastic book called “The Book of Strangers” by the Scottish Sufi convert _NAME_, I’d recommend that as well. It is great to have inlaws and grandchildren, but it is important that elders are respected by their family and offspring. Of course, you cannot just be expected to be respected if you cannot adequately communicate your age or understand your children and th
eir family. Sometimes you have to do some research to gain a better understanding. Coming from a mixed family myself, I know that my grandmother lived the longest, whilst my uncle and grandfather died young. Such is the risk of having adventurous daughters. Thank you."

OUP Academic Language Games, Paranoia, and Psychosis My experience with paranoia and psychosis may well be quite typical; however, it has always been very hard to explain what the experience of paranoia and psycho nb Language games in schizophrenia. Effectively, I became addicted to thinking about how words could be used to make coded references. I became obsessed with playing language games instead of using language primarily as it is normally used. I have been able to observe and converse with my fellow patients, and I have come to the conclusion that the overwhelming majority of the patients are also lost in a world of language games. People who suffer from paranoia often report a high state of arousal during times of paranoia and I have felt this too. I think that the effect of this state of arousal was to make me very susceptible to language games because I was very conscious of every little gestu

After being on strattera a few weeks I am waking up regularly at around 8 or 9am and going to bed around 10 or 11pm and less paranoid/irrational. It’s improving my psychosis because it’s improving my negative symptoms and cognition. thanks for all the input though I’m sure everyone is different. I will be monitoring the side effects and tell my doctor if anything gets severe or worse."
176168114,"I didn’t like it. When I feel low confidence and fancy guys on the course it really turns up my avoidance personality and turns me into a mute. I made a friend though. Idk how our relationship will continue she sometimes does drugs and that triggers me. Especially because it was with her when I did drugs and alcohol. and then got ill. I have nostalgic memories though I guess because I was young and energetic. I did find it difficult I struggled a lot with my focus and organisation. In the end I was eating 100g of dark chocolate every morning for breakfast to get me through the exam revision period. Best of wishes with it it’s great because you are older and wiser now so you will be organised and focused, taking it seriously."

Since i always kind of wished they had taken that approach to me and read indeed that they helped real well, it interests me that you disliked it so. I actually sought out a modern soteria house…it changed a bit… they do use medication now, but only optional, if someone really wants it themselves. Unless someone is completely out of control, in which case they are first getting fulltime guidance and in emergencies are shipped to a normal ward. They did keep the empathy and seeking connection part. And they actually had a fulltime psychologist in the house, whereas normal wards here have none (strangly)."

So been on weekly scripts now for years - cos i cannot be trusted lol."

Then they diagnosed me with it, and I was recommend a self help book, which is now in the bin - and the autism specialist was supposed to be on a call with my pdoc but didn’t bother. The psychologist said as her argument for being tested that it would inform her treatment. She then told me just before she retired that her techniques would not work with someone who has ASD, and all the stuff we had worked on was never going to go anywhere. My case manager says that autism in services is a ‘hole’ that exists in support. I just don’t think it’s good enough. I told him that what is the point of diagnosing people with these things if there is no support or treatment. _AT_MENTION_ I know you may want answers, but an official diagnosis if you live in a country with a public health system is patchy at best.

Those bubbles were burst after a few months. From what you write, all evidence seems to point towards a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

176168239,When I was 24 hours away from being involuntarily hospitalized I believed something similar. So I’d say you’re possibly en route to becoming a danger to yourself or others.

If you were addicted you’d write fake doctors prescriptions and take them to every pharmacy in town just hoping to luck out and down the whole bottle the second you got it. That’s not you. I believe it’s a two part medication. For me anyway there were meds before the AP’s. That they give you and the two counteract each other giving the desired effect.

I asked my sister if i have better thoughts will the suffering end? She said yes.

Since APs cut down on dopamine, the reason why you’re eating very little bit of food NOW is because your brain gets its dopamine from the exercise then it DOWNS it cuz of the effect of the APs. So you up your dopamine with exercise and down your dopamine with APs, in turn making you rarely hungry. My advice is to eat lightly before a workout and after a workout. Hope this helps."

The voice sounded like it came from everywhere at once, or sort of in the center of my head…was interesting…i remember him saying something like ""The moment the Buddha became enlightened, his body died (followed by a firm but calm laugh).

174385142,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Are Patients With Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders More Prone to Manifest Nocebo-Like-Effects? A _NAME_-Analysis of Adverse Events in Placebo Groups of Double-Blind Antipsychotic Trials. S Palermo, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in pharmacology , 2019 Background: Antipsychotic clinical trials use to present adverse events (AEs) for the drug under evaluation to treat schizophrenia. Interestingly, patients who receive the placebo during antipsychotic trials often report several AEs, but little is known about the essence of these negative effects in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SCD). In the present _NAME_-analysis, we evaluated the relationship between the level of psychiatric symptomatology expressed as Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and the rates of AEs reported in the placebo arms of double-blind clinical trials, for commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications. Methods: We selected 58 clinical trials describing AEs in S
CD placebo groups, which compared atypical antipsychotic medications with placebo. A total of 6,301 placebo-treated patients were considered. AE profiles of the class were clusterized using MedDRA classification and analysed using a _NAME_-regression approach. Results: In the placebo arms the proportions of patients with any AE was 66.3% (95% CI: 62.7-69.8%). The proportion of withdrawal of patients treated with placebo because of AEs was 7.2% (95% CI: 5.9-8.4%). Interestingly, the AEs in the placebo arms corresponded to those of the antipsychotic-atypical-medication-class against which the placebo was compared. Namely, using _NAME_-regression analysis we found an association between the level of psychiatric symptomatology measured with PANSS scores and higher AEs reported as nervous system (p = 0.020) and gastrintestinal disorders (p = 0.004). Moreover, the level of a higher psychiatric symptomatology expressed with PANSS scores was also related with higher AEs associated with psychiatric symptoms (p = 0.017
). Conclusion: These findings emphasise that the AEs in placebo arms of clinical trials of antipsychotic medications were substantial. Importantly, a higher level of psychiatric symptomatology makes SCD patients more prone to express AEs, thus contributing to possible drop-outs and to a lower adherence to treatments. These results are consistent with the expectation theory of placebo and nocebo effects."

IT’S NOT ABOUT YOU.” I think that they hall mark telling sign of a narcissist is when you really can’t consider other people’s feelings valid. Or if you’d rather believe in a lie than look at reality for what it is… or if you have a problem with lying in general. Narcissists are good at repainting truths to hold themselves in a higher light… and are actually terrible at accepting fairness. Everything is supposed to fall to their whim. Narcissism isn’t normally about being dominant… narcissism is more the pursuit of being the magically lucky one out of the crowd. You can grow out of it… it is more or less on the maturity level of a kid in a playground. I think that’s where narcissism 
shows most prominently. Kids who just have to have the best stuff, start looking pissed if anyone has things that they don’t etc… look to that kind of slant on things. Jealousy is narcissism’s twin. Just throwing a few thoughts in there. Even a narcissist isn’t some kind of defunct person… narcissists can, and routinely do, do great things for other people."

That is the best chair design i believe because it encourages getting up and down a bit. You dont want a super comfortable cushion chair. You want the impetus to get up and and to make good progress at the computer as well when you are at it. _PERSON_ i believe the best way to clean a chiar like that is with general purpose cleaning spray say windex and then wipe it with a microfibre cloth or wipe it with general purpose cleaning wipes.

174385170,Well my mother has schizophrenia and bipolar. But these are details that I would rather keep private and not share on a public forum. But I’ll say it anyway.
176168488,What a strange thing that we schizophrenics have so much dopamine and serotonin naturally I remember that without drugs I was very happy
176168489,"Take a shower or bath and brush your teeth at least once per day. Your mind shouldn’t be questioning about it. It’s true throughout history people didn’t bathe regularly and there are other considerations such as not feeling or appearing dirty but in modern times its normal to bathe regularly. Im saying this as someone who has once gone longer than a year without bathing, but even in more recent psychoses I have bathed regularly."
176168490,Do you have a therapist?

176168492,12mg every day. I take the pills.
174385167,You can’t really control your father unfortunately. But If he wants to dismiss your schizophrenia then he’s living in a fantasy land. Keep taking the medication and don’t self harm. You have to stand up for yourself in that regard.
176168493,"Heard voices at 12. Had my first psychotic break at 14, didn’t get on antipsychotics until I was 32. I self medicated with drugs and alcohol for all those years. And managed to stay out of the wards thanks to my family always bailing me out and keeping me safe. In psychosis, voices almost constantly, thinking I was chosen, and the dead picked on me. I got sober after I came out of a delusion at 28. Then got a Psychiatrist at 32, after my first and only trip to the ward. Life is amazing on medication, the voices don’t bother me nearly as much, I’m not as confused and old delusions have faded, helped keep me from forming new delusions. 20 years unmedicated with voices, believing I was this psychic chosen one."

I am really sorry that despite your treatment (I know you take your APs), you still experience paranoia and delusions. I wish I could help you but I don’t know how. Just remember, if I am allowed to say, that you are not Buddha and you are not Jesus. And the TV doesn’t send you secret messages.You are just a human being (I don’t even remember your real name, sorry) who _NAME_ the short stick on the genetic lottery. I am the same.

176168514,What kind of delusions do you have?
174385177,"Ok, so here’s the problem you have, yes the cameras are watching, but no one is watching these cameras for the most part, until a crime is reported or they go back in their records and look for employee theft or vandalism that occurred around some time. Its normal to feel like you’re in an odd situation, because you are. Schizophrenia isn’t “normal”, and people are going to treat you differently, you might have to really work hard to get rid of this delusion’s teeth, but basically don’t act on it, don’t give in to it. This is just a nagging doubt about the reality of your situation that is now being warped into this sort of pestering belief. Its a bummer but please just keep working on it. If anything just try breathing exercises and trying to stop thinking about it. Breathe in and just think about the movement of air in and out, and think the thoughts “in” and “out” repetitively and it will help calm you down, if you breath at a relaxed pace."
176168515,"Yes, it passes the time, keeps one engaged, and puts a few more coins in the pocket."
176168516,I was used to waste all of my money for gaming. Now the last game I bought was Battlefield 5. Played a bit and gave my cousin the account data. Other than that I just bought in january XBox Live Gold for six months. And it has been some weeks when I last played a game. I was once a hardcore gamer in my early 20s. Somewhere before my 25 th birthday I quit gaming and got back into skateboarding. Then my psychosis came when I was 26. It just came randomly. The problem are the delusions that I get with gaming. I get a feeling that I should quit. But I’m so used to just smoke and lay in bed that I can not get my hobby back for sure.
174385185,"Before my illness, I was like a class clown, but not really making jokes as much as I made fun of myself. Now, though, I lost some of that, but still can make fun of myself every now and then. I even make fun of my schizophrenia, which I do very rarely."

176168538,"My main voice harassed me for two decades to do art, to draw. He tortured me because I would not accept his attention and draw. It was really, really bad. I started drawing about a year ago, when I found a way to do it, by studying different artists. I decided to sketch not make serious drawings and it worked out. Now my voices are telling me not to draw, it’s bad, because I draw from the subconscious. I worry about this in _NAME_ and would like your feedback. I want to draw, and I like free association."

I live with an 80 year old type 1 diabetic so I’m kind of on lockdown until a vaccine comes out. Also, they say 12-18 months for a vaccine. But we are already about 3 months deep into that. Scientists started on that a few weeks after the virus surfaced. So it could be as soon as 9 months."
176168545,"I honestly don’t. But I do realize that if I don’t like it when it’s done to me then I shouldn’t do that same thing to others. I also now understand that certain things are very counterproductive to the function of the majority and should not only not be done, but actively discouraged. It’s a matter of logic, not belief in some supreme being on my part."

There are new technologies coming into being that could, hopefully, enable us to support all earth’s people in comfort - genetic engineering, nanotechnology, graphene, better microchips for our computers, super computers, and many more.

You can use his example to better yourself. Good luck to you."

176168558,"In 2018, I had a very demanding job. Worked 20-28 hours without a break. Would go from one site to another. So I’m driving around totally sleep deprived which is as bad as drunk. Sometimes would just sleep in the break room and set an alarm on my phone. I ended up leaving the job not because of the work, but they never got a single paycheck right. It was always something - no mileage reimbursement, incorrect overtime, incorrect regular time, everything. The point I’m ineffectively making is the more I worked and stayed busy physically, the sleep would come naturally - that I’d be so tired my body would just go to sleep and the brain would be forced into hibernation."
176168559,No. I like smoking. Why?
176168560,"I dunno. Every job I have ever been to lets you know immediately when you screw up, and every good job has someone who retrains you on how to do it correctly. A good job in the US comes with at least a month of on-the-job training, and the cost of that training is high enough that employers generally would rather retrain employees who make mistakes than just hire someone new. If I was making the same mistake all semester because I didn’t understand one thing in the beginning, and then I failed, I would consider that a failure of the school to do the job of teaching me the material. Correcting mistakes seems like a really fundamental part of teaching to me. I suppose it depends on the goal of the university. If the goal is to test your self-sufficiency and skills, I can see that model working. If the goal is to teach you skills, I think our system is better."
176168561,"Be careful. I just read a story in the news about a woman who got an infection in her big toe from a cut she got during a pedicure. She had to have it amputated, and the infection still spread and she ended up with toxic shock syndrome from it. Her kidneys failed and now she’s on the list for a new kidney. Take your antibiotics faithfully and don’t miss any doses"
176168562,I have always thought that it was quite the opposite. Someone else had what was missing in my life. You have a good point and it’s something to consider _AT_MENTION_.
174385198,"I’m 52 and still struggling. No meds. Diagnosed after many many years of suffering tell-tale symptoms. It did not seek this diagnosis. I sought help. Unless you’re an imminent, visible, danger to yourself and/or others, as observed by a professional, they can’t force you to take medication. I have been recommended and refused medication many times. Staying informed is really important for doctors and patients alike so that treatment methods are the best suited to each person. Schizophrenia, so horribly misunderstood and mistreated for so long, is understood to be a spectrum disorder, much like Autism. To treat one person at one end of the spectrum the same as a person at the other end of the spectrum would be a mistake. I have had other forms of help and management, such as CBT. It certainly would be unrealistic to think it’s possible to manage and improve alone. I’d be dead now if I had done that."

174385197,But when I get hypomania nowadays I feel that energy and restlessness and elation. But I have avolition as well and no sex drive or frenetic goals nor do I do risky things. It’s like I have hypomania and negatives at same time. Or depression - but not feeling sad but high. If I had depression or irritable mood along with energy I would understand it to be mixed episodes but when I have this high yet with avolition I get confused - is it hypomania and negative symptoms at same time? Or isn’t it hypomania but rather disorganised behaviour of sza? Confusing!

176168611,"I’m sharing because you understand. My treatment team includes my psychiatrist, my counselor, and two therapists from an intensive outpatient program. My psychiatrist and counselor allow me to email them. I sent a group email last Friday to all four of them. The IOP therapists did not respond to me, but they called my psychiatrist, my counselor, and my husband to talk about me. I emailed again on Tuesday. Again they did not respond to me but they called my husband to talk about me. I felt ignored and didn’t know what to do, so I canceled services with them. The problem is they were helping me with my ocd. They finally emailed me back, “We are confirming that we’ve canceled all future appointments.” Today my counselor had me call them back and apologize and ask if they will let me back into the program. They ignored my phone call and text. All I am thinking is, “I suck at life.”"

She admits now it was a good thing although she personally hated me over it for a couple of months at the time. By age 15 I backed off her search history and she had a phone, and I mainly kept tabs on the GPS when she was out of the house for extended periods. I backed off more and more as she approached 18. Now that she’s almost 20, I won’t even go in her bedroom without knocking as it is HER space.

176168655,For me the diagnostic process is a very weak area of psychiatry… Too much rushing to change diagnosis due to individual biases as to what symptoms matter more. Too much thinking that how a person presents here and now while medicated trumps a longer pattern of behaviours and symptoms when medication adherence was not as good. Not enough listening to the service user to get an accurate picture of how the service user actually is. Jumping to conclusions is not just something that those with psychosis are prone to doing.

Some are very good (based on the stated experiences of other people) , and some should never have been allowed into the profession (for the most part my own personal experience) . Since being here , in Wiltshire , I’ve not been treated as though I’m awkward,demanding and troublesome. I have had a personality disorder label , based on antipathy towards me as a patient , overturned . Mental health professionals here are not bad mannered and boorish , as they so often were in Essex . It’s refreshing , but in practical terms too late to make a major difference in terms of future achievements , That is not in any way the fault of the mental health pros here . They are not responsible for the substandard care and support I got in Essex.

174385270,"Same thing with me. I think alot of us with sz didn’t socialize much even prior to being diagnosed officially or having our first episodes. I personally always felt awkward around people, I didn’t interact alot with others. Yeah I had one or two friends but that was it. Even now that I’m relatively stable I don’t like going out or meeting new people. The friends I had in school have all moved on with their lives and have careers and a family. That gets me down sometime but I’m really happy for them. What I don’t like is most just drifted away and forgot about me and reati get it they have their lives and I’m not an attention seeker but a little text once in a while just to say hi wouldn’t hurt. I now if the tables were turned I would still check in on them and see how they are doing. The truth is life goes on one just has to learn to deal with it"
176168786,"…and I hate myself to the core. I got denied by my last choice of post-secondary education today, and I hate myself. I ripped out pages and pages in my diary and threw out my belongings, such as books, although they are very little (probably like one book). I also cut the photos that included my face, because I hated myself so so much. I’m thinking of throwing out my graduation photos later since I hate my presence. I’m also spending thousands of money from my parents’ bank account to boost my marks…and I’m just so upset. Why do I keep torturing them??? I don’t understand I’m going to cut more pages in my diary tomorrow. My existence is horrible and my memories with others are rubbish."

174385265,"It’s the only AP that has worked for me and I’ve tried all of them except clozapine. I don’t get any side effects and I’ve lost weight on it. It doesn’t stimulate my appetite like the others do. I find it activating and I’m much more awake and active on it. It seems to reduce both positive and negative symptoms for me. I’m not drowsy and sleeping all the time like I was on Amisulparide. The only way to find out what it will do to you is try. I am on 15mg now, but years ago I was on 60mg. 15 seems to work just as good as 60."

Tonight I thought I wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep, but then it seemed like I was going to. However, just as I was about to fall asleep, my voices woke me up with an insult.

She also said I’d fall in the middle of priorities. So probably people with physical afflictions get the most attention. They also work REALLY slow.

It’s illogical to think you can win all the time but I think my perfectionist tendencies make me want to win all the time at it. Recently I’ve realized how strong your mental game has to be for it, I’m confident in my own skills and I’d like to start competing again sometime but I get so crazy nervous.

Obviously good for sliding back and forth i wont mess it up i will just adhere with 3M double sided tape a placemat circle to the bottom and tape uhmw polyethylene tape to the bottom that would be totally reversible. My monitor is a bit ?????? as well glitches and stuff there was more reason for it With my pc it is so simple i believe my modification of that cooler simply changed it somehow where the pc would not start up after a while. It makes no difference it is the same apu amd athlon 3000g and it is better that it runs at stock clock to save on power consumption. I have a case fan in the front anyway which will make sure it is cool and ooling isnt even a concern with a lower power thing like that which is the whole point It is good that the monitor is slim as well because I will be carrying it back far distances it will be in a box

174385272,"So after after 20 years of chemically socialized conditioning, I think I have come to a rudimentary conclusion. The term “schizophrenia” is translated as “divided mind”. Don’t be surprised if another term is enacted. What it really means to me, is the family, culture, friends, political and economic status that I was born into, are rife with division. What psychosis has been defined as, is a psychic illness, with biological components that to this point has only been addressed by biological methods, from chaining a person to a wall and beating them into submission, or chemically incarcerating and promising every voice will lead you to violence against yourself, others, or the precious system if you are allowed to listen. What I found, is the impossible nature of psychosis, that it has all the elements of reality, combined with a reaction by others, which defies all medical models. We are simply a group of apes that roam the world, fearfully seeking meaning and purpose, and when some autho
rity figure suggests we are the problem, or some other group is, we tend to agree. It’s a greed, which with we have agreed."

176168832,"You’re not doing yourself any favours by watching videos like that, all you’re doing is taking yourself deeper down the rabbit hole. You know you’re the kind of person who eats up conspiracy theories and “alternative science” material raw. So you need to do your sanity a favour and shy away from it. And perhaps give more thought to the amount of energy drinks you binge. Try to focus less on the feeling that sz was something done to you (because it’s impossible to cause sz in others) and focus more on learning to manage the symptoms and accepting that this is for life."
176168833,"I have had life long delusions, like believing I am God and immortal. And some delusions that go along with paranoia. Most come and go with medication. When I’m on good medication and can focus on something like I’m doing now, delusions aren’t as bad. But they never go away completely."

My son was adopted at birth by amazing parents, we’re very close to this day. Anyway, all this to say, I don’t want children, But I still doubt myself at times. I had tubal ligation and sometimes regret it. I think this “need to have kids” feeling is hormonal. Most women experience a big mental kick to get pregnant at several times in their lives. I think it’s best to err on the side of caution and not have children if you have doubts. It’s better than the alternative."

176168852,"I guess what annoys me most about the “can-do” sentiment is that it’s not true. It sucks, but the fact of the matter is that not all of us have the capacity to lead normal lives. The result is that the people who can’t are treated like they’re not trying hard enough. It just hurts when people talk about how they were successful so anyone else can do it if they work at it. It’s painful for me personally when someone discounts my limitations by saying things like they had illness just as severe as mine but made their way back to normalcy therefore I should be able to do the same. People on here have told me how I’m an adult and that if I want to get out of sucky situations with my mom that I need to get my own place, leave the nest. They did it. Why can’t I? The fact that I can’t yet support myself doesn’t make me weak. It’s just the current reality. I’m getting better, but I’m just not there yet, and that’s okay.

174385296,Never seen a ghost but something grabbed me on the shoulder once. Turned around and no-one there. Besides that iv’e had an OBE once. I was sleeping and when i woke up i was floating above my bed facing the bare light bulb. I felt like a helium balloon just bouncing off the ceiling which felt like static. I was really stoked to be up there but my excitement got the better of me and i fell back into my resting body and sat up. I felt hundreds of tiny little electric currents run through my body. It was an amazing experience but i wanted to prove to myself it wasn’t a dream. So i laid back down and closed my eyes and ‘willed’ myself to rise out of my body and i felt those same electric currents again. I was up and floating again. The most peaceful feeling ever. Haven’t had another experience since. This was me before my schizophrenia diagnosis
176168874,"I like going to bed at 10:30, but that’s because it gives me a little time with hubby when he’s on day shift, and a little time by myself when he’s on nights. Right now, I’ve been going to bed waaay late, though. It’ll take some time to get it sorted out."

He laughs at me constantly and says it is funny how I die. He says I’m going to die in a funny way. So, I keep trying to figure out how I will die in the future. I keep trying to figure things out and it drives me crazy. Anyway thanks for the post _AT_MENTION_. It was really nice."

I only weigh once a week, otherwise who knows if it’s just water weight going up and down? Once a week gives my body time to actually lose a pound or two for real. I also don’t want to be obsessive, I had bulimia for ten years. Even though I am in remission, it’s easy to fall back into unhealthy decisions. Once a week weigh-ins are enough for me."

176168895,they range in ages from late teens to 50/60s
176168896,I don’t think I feel strong enough to be alone after this age. My SO had some event last week and came home very late. I felt sick and so lonely throughout the night. Isolation is scary. I need company. Also I’m all alone with no family.
176168897,They think I’m unwell because I’m doing it. My voices are very threatening. They say they are going to kill 1000 people everytime I dont listen to them and that my thoughts have killed thousands of babies. I’m not like me at the moment I feel like I’m under electronic warfare

176168902,I watched a reality tv rap competition on Netflix a while back. The judges would say things like “I f*** with that” or “I f*** with you” and I picked up that it was slang for “I really liked that”. _PERSON_ was a judge and _PERSON_ also and Chance the _PERSON_. Can’t think of the name of the show.
176168903,"I love Ativan. It calms me down if I have an anxiety attack and its great when I can’t sleep, yet it doesn’t make me drowsy… but I use it very rarely because like all benzodiazepenes you can develop a physical dependence on it. Out of all the psych meds I have tried Ativan my favorite."

These inferences could be general and/or in reference to the effectiveness of their medicine or treatment. _PERSON_..."

176168911,"Yes, this. But I know it’s kinda upside down. I worry about living forever though and negative ramifications of it hanks to tech. I don’t trust tech that much anymore and maybe there’s validity to this. I’d rather be forgotten. I’d rather ‘lights out’ at the end of my journey. The SZ part is I’m afraid I stick out like a sore thumb in all walks, and that I’m too ‘famous’."

174385293,You can just read the abstract. Its a resume.
174385291,I used to get derealization from meds. I was a fool to have believed it was my ‘schizophrenia’…
176168919,I’m wondering what any of y’all do in this situation. I was psychotic for several years. I was mean to staff due to my illness and someone literally walked right in my room and poured a shattered fill vile full of blood in my ear. It was a tech. Well I never sought treatment other than an STD HiV test because I was so against hospitals by then. Now I’m starting to get expanding ear pain in that ear and I haven’t had earwax in years. This happened in 2015
176168920,Pressure certainly can contribute.
176168921,"Yeah. Bilirubin levels elevated, and enlarged liver. From 30 years of drinking. Get the odd liver pain too. Enlarged red blood cells too."

176168926,I don’t really want or need kids really. It definitely affects me.
176168927,"I don’t have wild mood swings of extreme suicidal depressions and high flying mania’s. I’m not paranoid anymore. I don’t have all the thought broadcasting and thought insertion I had before. I don’t get constant voices and auditory, visual, tactile, gustatory and olfactory hallucinations anymore. I don’t get all the delusions of reference that I had before."
176168928,Here on a reply screen got pasted ** strong words **

174385299,"_AT_MENTION_-spray it wasn’t working for me. Plus too many side effects _AT_MENTION_ I told my pdoc that I would take a rest from APs. He agreed with my decision and told me that if I have an episode to contact him asap . I dont hear voices, I just get paranoid thoughts and my pdoc knows this."
176168931,If I pay it I am admitting guilt.
176168932,"How does one cope with false memories? With visions and delusion? How “can” one cope? When all your senses tell you what is true, when logic loses out, when they tell you you’re mad for this. That you’re sick for trusting what you experience. They tell me they don’t matter, to let them go…but never once tried to teach me how…they can’t erase memories, experiences, can’t change them, but they expect you too. Voices, messages, visions. I know of others who had these maladies, and they were deemed something of high praise. I remember the gate, and the pits. The endless golden fields, and the chasms filled with bodies, the endless fires. I’ve seen the things that their books write of, that they deem as “truth”. And they want me to believe it’s all in my head… I don’t know…I don’t know what to believe sometimes, and I certainly don’t know how I’m meant to cope with that."
176168933,"When my psychosis gets bad, I dissociate and go emotionally numb."
176168934,"I experienced something similar during my first episode . My brain was like mush, I couldn’t read… everything was slurred… and my sentences made no sense… my friend was there for me… she encourages me to keep trying to read… I wasn’t sure I would come back… I also experienced catatonia I would just freeze in place like I was in a trance/paralyzed for a few minutes I could not move… i was in a cab… heading home from campus when this happened… I don’t talk much abt the first episode."
176168935,Supermarkets count
176168936,So now the question is how do you not pay attention to them?
176168937,If it was a danger issue I would be concerned. But usually I feel the med rules are not so specific or generalized as this where the individual responds to treatment differently. I’m sure this works for me in terms of therapy. As long as there’s no dangers im good with it
174385297,This is sort of easy… You were probably focused on what you were thinking more than the environment… the schizophrenia ployed the old copy paste method into your auditory memory. I’ve over heard crap loads of those things for years. They never proved true… but there are specific places where they proved totally untrue. People having to ask others to repeat what they said etc. Keep on keeping on… eventually those scenarios become a whole lot easier to ignore. It proves foolish to try and obligate people to help you keep it all straight.
176168938,"I believe our memories are wiped and our experiences become part of our personality in the next life we’re born into. We’re not necessarily reborn as humans. I feel every experience and struggle in life is there to teach our souls something they’ll need, and that every life we live is designed to get us one step closer to enlightenment, were we’ll be able to stop the reincarnation cycle for our soul and become one with the energies of the universe."
174385301,"I have been having a rough time, suicide ideation, lack of meaning with life, insomnia. Mood swings. I was hospitalized, locked ward, for 2 days, then three weeks in real life, and then hospitalized, open ward, for seven days due to a minor psychosis and insomnia. The pdoc added 5 mg Olanzapine to the 10 mg of abilify im used to, and i now im able to sleep and function and go to work. Is olanzapine/abilify a good combo in that dose? Or is it too much with to ap’s and one ad (i take marplan/ mao-inhibitor but it doesn’t work for my depression anymore and i want to stop it.)"
176168939,Life has up and downs. it might be going down right now but I promise it will get better. Voices can be overwhelming I normally listen to music to drown them out Do you have anything that helps with them?

176168943,"She literally waited till halfway through the semester to start grading, and she is a hard grader. It seems like the grades are based more on how she is feeling than what you really did. She didn’t follow my directions on how to go through my last series of work and of course then didn’t understand it. This is perhaps the lowest grade I have ever had in college, even though my peer reviews are exceptional right now. I hate it"

176168949,"Good for you! I’m so happy to hear you’re doing better! Lamictal is a lifesaver. I take 100 mg at night and it really helps with depression and mood. Good that you are now on maintenance doses of your meds too. I was on 10 mg of Zyprexa at first, but my pdoc and I have figured out that 7.5 mg is my lowest effective dose, so I am on that now. I am in the U.S. so I can’t try amisulpride, but it sounds like it’s a great drug going by what people post here."
176168950,"Day 81 update: I reduced my dose for a week back to 4-4-4 out of budgetary fears, but then I realized that this stuff was the only thing keeping my head pressure in check, so I upped the dose 50% to 5-5-5-4, even though it’s going to cost more. No longer taking Amyloban 3399. Am taking Haldol 1-2 mg a day. Symptoms are basically off now, I only hear them half-asleep. Pressure is very low and manageable. My diet is just avoiding bread, dairy, nightshade vegetables, citrus, and strawberries. Super low fat, high carb. I am now so mentally comfortable I can watch technical training videos to learn Python, 30 mins at a time, with 10 min breaks. I can work now!"

174385309,does it cause restlessness?
176168955,My last episode landed me in therapy for life. I knew I was in trouble when I was asked about super powers.
176168956,Yes those are definitely unusual beliefs. Just as long as you don’t take them seriously you should be ok.
176168957,"yeah, that sounds more like psychosis than how it is being said."
176168958,"i read some threads people saying that their dosage increase in a long run, is that true?"

174385313,My son has been through hell and back for about three years on various medications with no relief. has been on Klonopin for only a few weeks now and I am already starting to see a big difference with him. His not the one to ask as he has an acid nausea so he is not able 2 differentiate the symptoms that he is having with his hallucinations and paranoia as anything different from reality as he used to know it. Klonopin works differently on the brain and I think it is worth a try it just has a bad reputation because of the blood count but this is only in about 1% certain people and they test your blood regularly. Quality of life is essential. Good luck.

176168966,Not a lot really. It doesn’t take much for my mood to plummet and suicide is on the table. I get really low - especially at the weekends when I have no work to occupy me Music is about the only thing that inspires me.
176168967,I could keep my job but i do not think i could manage two of them. Plus the 9am to 5:30pm hours even though its only 3 days a week or so. I like to work 4-5 hours a day … otherwise i start finding it hard to concentrate and not zone out.

176168990,"I know how horribly evil the voices can be, believe it, you are not the only one. I used to wonder how it got in me? I have read a lot and found ideas that helped me. They are only theories. The voices come from the subconscious. The subconscious has no clear line between it and the conscious. The voices are you. They could be an old self. Maybe it’s mad at the path you’ve taken. It could be a creation of sexual relationships. Try your best to make friends with it, even if they are evil. That didn’t work in the end for me and the voice I overcame but it helped. The voice was too far gone. It wants you gone and you want it gone, but try not to destroy it, that causes disturbance. Most of all learn to believe it is not really another person, that it is not real. It worked for me. I learned to doubt and doubt and doubt. When I saw through it, it went away. And I know the power of the human mind is godlike in that it can make such great creations and produce altered states, even euphoria. You’v

174385340,"In paper my diagnosis was always psychotic disorder NOS, but the docters talked about a depression case at beginning and also said that my case was sz."
176169018,It’s a cognitive symptom of sz. I have a cycle of really forgetful times to sharper. It can fluctuate wildly.
176169019,Do I share too much personal information on here? You guys know my whole life story. Maybe I should shut up. Now I feel bad. I just don’t have a therapist right now and I don’t have any friends except you.
174385325,What do you mean positive safety record?
176169020,I’m upset but I have no reason to be - I’ve seen some pretty nightmarish things from these forums and depression forums at carenity and other people have it rough

176169022,"After you answer our questions and tell us what is the change that occurs in the basic structure of the mind and becomes a natural part of its structure for unknown period of time We ask you the following question; What is the nature of the mutational factor who is induces the changing in the mind’s structure and creates the sz condition as a mental illness or else ? ( an anatomical factor,genetic ,psychological or environmental stimuli …etc) In the case,if you do not know the change that occurs in the mind’s structure you will fail to find any mutational factor support your theoretical assumptions !! and you will see"
176169023,"Yeah, I always used to say I didn’t want kids. Now I’ve had 6. Funny how that happened."
176169024,Monday I see my pdoc and begging to get off lithium. I’m nauseated almost all the time.
176169025,"Sorry for bothering u guys. I was arranging my medicine strips(blister pack) 15 mins ago. They were on floor. And I accidentally stepped on few of them, can that damage my meds ? Whats worst case scenario ? 600×600 43.6 KB"

176169035,Wow you _NAME_ all those without looking?! Impressive!
176169036,"Losing weight takes time. It’s alright to get frustrated, but don’t turn the blame on yourself. Lots of factors play in, and it shouldn’t have to be hard. You’re a wonderful person with a lot of good qualities. And being a bit overweight doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have a heart attack or any of the other comorbidities. You are warm, loving, funny, caring, and I’m sure those who love you would rather see you chubby and happy than slim and miserable. You said you eat your feelings. Is that something you can discuss with a therapist?"
176169037,I am currently in the conflict of de-personifying my illness. It acts like a disembodied entity that is trying to ruin my life so that only we are together and it works convincing me its real about half of the time now. Another one was that the moon killed someone in my name asking nothing in return so i needed to help it destroy the sun. And then recently i misheard something my wife told me about hallucinations and went back into thinking one of mine were real for a period.
176169038,I’m 36 but when I was 29 my sleep was very messed up. Don’t be so hard on yourself.

176169043,Do you dissociate?
176169044,Thank you! I appreciate it.
176169045,My wife and I have a glaringly open relationship…I open a beer and she glares at me.

176169047,"You don’t really need someone that specializes in psychosis. Generally any adult psychiatrist that doesn’t say they dont work with psychosis should do. If you dont mind me asking what kind of insurance is he on so I can search for you, or are you going to pay out of pocket"

174385334,"Abilify didn’t work for me. There is no way to predict how a medication change will turn out beforehand. I’ve made switches that didn’t work, had bad side effects and that worked out better. It’s a roll of the dice."
176169050,"Most of my life, I was pretty slim. But I never was anorexic."
176169051,Mine are similar to archons and iluminati controlling the universe with there minds and putting me in a false reality waiting to get tortured by them for fun
176169052,Ride out those bad days. I’ve found it gets better but surfing through the bad times and enjoying the good really is a survival skill. Hope your on the improve.
174385338,My meds help with positive symptoms but they literally do nothing for my negative symptoms. I find my own meanings as well about everything going on around me and about me. I told my pdoc last week that there is not a pill out there that will make my delusions go away. I believe that their real I don’t believe it’s delusions. I think everything has a meaning for me exclusively. And I feel like I’m always in high alert and guarded about anything and everything. This site is the only place I feel safe and I can say what I really feel and everyone either can relate or give me good sound advise. I wish I knew the answers. If I did I’d spread that news around like it was a wildfire
176169053,"I need a new tagline. How about: “If I’d only seen, that the joke was on me.”"
176169054,It’s hard knowing whether you are actually schizophrenic. I think you are. But I doubt myself. So I know the difficulty that it is.
176169055,They followed me to Europe to pickme up.
176169056,The meds keep me from doing these things

174385345,Yes Lets hope so friend
176169061,"Forget about it…you just have to turn the psychology around…like it’s a privilege to have sz. jk No, I totally agree. It’s hard on us. But just got to keep that positive mindset. Our situation might improve for whatever reason. There might come better drugs. You never know."

174385337,"I believe at times that I really don’t have SzA, and am afraid others will accuse me of faking it. But when my pdoc switched me to Abilify last May, he put me on only 5mg of it. I started hallucinating and got paranoid. My therapist had a hell of a time trying to convince me to go back and see my pdoc again. He upped the dose to 10mg, and I mostly stopped hallucinating, but still get paranoid occasionally. But my point is that every time I go off meds, I get sick. That should be enough to convince me that I really do have SzA."
176169065,What I was basically doing was projecting my own creativity on to the world…and then responding to my own echo. Does this make sense to you?
176169066,"I am the same sometimes. I do this thing now called, “not doing anything wrong”. It’s really simple. For me, if I am riding my bike, or I am at work or I am playing football, I am “not doing anything wrong”, and that’s the best I can do with my life for now. You could try and do that, find things to do where you know in your heart feel “right” and that you are “not doing anything wrong” while doing! good luck friend"

176169070,You’re not a parasite. You’re a child of God and it’s not your fault you can’t tolerate things other people can. Hopefully they’ll come up with better medication.
174385344,"But were you on help support or some sort of ‘‘well-fare’’, or you paid straight cash on it without any government support?"
176169071,"The whole point is delaying it. Every country has herd immunity as the goal, or at least just a seasonal pattern. That’s never been a UK thing. The point of delaying it is so that the health care system has capacity to deal with all the patients who need treatment. The current rates of deaths per confirmed case vary widely, from about 1% to about 6-7%. Most of those deaths are probably due to a lack of access to adequate health care. The UK health system is not equipped to deal with this virus if the current growth rate continues."
176169072,I’m scared of overmedication
176169073,I hope I do too
176169074,There are many people who feel the presence of someone who passed away and they are not called sz or psychotic. I think it’s just ‘normal.’

176169078,Definitely yes.
176169079,I’m also on it for about 3 years. I use it to help me sleep and also if my legs get restless sometimes. I would prefer to get off the stuff but my pdoc says it is ok for me to take it because I take such a low dosage. Maybe you should ask your doc if you could try another benzo at a low dosage.
176169080,the positives just make your life awful

176169083,I just remembered something my dad did to help me when I was first hospitalized year twenty years ago. Back then they had payphones on the ward and you had to have quarters to call friends and family. My dad gave me a roll of quarters to give out to the other patients so that they could talk to someone if they needed to. My dad wasn’t rich and never made much money as a blue collar worker but would always try to help others even if it was in small ways. It was good therapy for me too because I was so afraid from my paranoia that I had trouble getting out of my shell.

174385357,"When I was first diagnosed with a mental illness the psychiatrist said I had bipolar disorder. But I think one of the issues was I was really thin and had a high metabolism, so my psychotic episodes were really energetic and manic. Basically they injected me with an antipsychotic at the hospital and when I woke up I was basically symptom free. So I said I was fine and refused treatment but they had a two week hold placed on me, and I stayed at the hospital perfectly normal until I was released. I was fine for a year then I started having psychotic symptoms again, no voices, a little paranoia, but mainly just really emotionally unstable. Anyway this story goes on for years. But basically in the end antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia made the symptoms go away, and my mood is pretty stable so the original diagnosis was wrong, even though the treatment for bipolar is often the same for schizophrenia."
176169102,_AT_MENTION_ I have addressed it in therapy. My counselor decided to leave and work with the criminally insane. I hope he’s ok there. I’m waiting to be assigned a new counselor. It may take a while because I’m receiving care under a new grant program now at the county mental health organization and so they want me to have a new case manager who works directly under that grant. I see her in a couple weeks. Then she can work on assigning me a new therapist. But they want me to focus on being held against my will and abused for 3 straight months first because they believe not dealing with that has hindered my progress in believing the men are just hallucinations and delusions.

And put on local police website that she must have broke in my room and stole my glasses meaning I can look in mirror and see I’m attractive and don’t need run after gun and I want restraining order agaisnt both of them and shes prob making up other lies like me dating a black guy.

As I mentioned before, I actually had positive symptoms from Wellbutrin for two days but I do not have any symptoms on Strattera. I feel like psychiatrists never know what drugs’ effects would have on a person, but they deny giving us a particular drug just because of what their previous experience with some patients had been like. When in fact every patient reacts differently to every single drug. I had to convince my psychiatrist to give me Strattera too."

I’ve found with the schizophrenia that it’s made my mind a mess, it feels like there’s a pile of books stacked up in front of me, pages are missing and the spines are broken, but then again my schizophrenia is more based upon anxiety and a sense of being disabled that yours seems to be. I honestly feel like “I can’t do anything”. I can only make myself pasta or a frozen pizza and can make Coffee/tea. I take Zuclopenthixol at 400mg each month or every 4 weeks. I have always felt very sedated by the drugs. I’m still hopeful that one day I’ll get off them, because I’ve read similar stories of people who had problems coming off in the past, yet eventually succeeded. Yet you have to be very careful, I personally want to continue taking my drugs until next year and luckily I’m on a medication that reduces gradually in the body, so doesn’t need tapering to the same degree. I see no reason why you couldn’t become a doctor if you 
wanted to become one, probably the main concern will be staying focused, for a long while now I’ve found that my concentration lapses, perhaps because of the drugs, or perhaps due to the [schizophrenia]. It really upsets me when I tell my Mum that I should have achieved more by now and she mentions that I’ve “been ill”, when of course I have, but want to put it to the back of my mind. If I’m successful in the future I will keep my schizophrenia a secret, I’d rather be cured of it and then abandon such issues. I’ve never had hallucinations or heard voices anyway. I take 500mg of Niacin per day, it’s not enough, but my parents won’t agree to buy me any more of it, it’s very good for schizophrenia and changes the biochemistry of those suffering from this illness, to become more mentally resilient. I don’t think the cognitive decline in schizophrenia is as bad at the acute phase, because at AS level in the UK (second to last year of secondary school) I achieved a D and E in History and Busin
ess, respectively. In the A2’s (the last year) I bumped it up to a C and a D and did so via distance learning, after my schizophrenia diagnosis. So anything is possible. Strangely enough I’ve found time without a computer to have made my mental health worse, the keyboard on my ASUS laptop is knackered, it no longer works, most keys fail."
176169140,"Yes a bit triggering. I’m not gonna live that down… and I am really internet embarrassed. Or just normally/plain embarrassed. But being afflicted mentally, being intelligent, having a healthy drive below the belt, and differentiating yourself in an organization, is a recipe for pain. People think of you as an “Evil Genius”… and not to trigger yet again, but sadistic topic(s) can occur. I was on the losing end. But most people won’t make my type of mistakes. I’m definitely a “Live One” as they say."
176169141,I buy not from concentrate apple and mango juice from Aldi. I drink about 2 litres a week. Also I have an apple for lunch week days which is new for me.
174385368,"This probably won’t help but I’ve worked while psychotic, I’ve worked while stoned which made my paranoia level go through the roof. I worked for a year positive that everybody hated me, I’ve worked while thinking everybody loved me (which is just as bad as thinking everybody hated me, lol), I’ve worked while addicted to crack, I have problems sometimes thinking people are laughing at me, I’ve worked while being clueless about what’s happening around me etc. Now none of these were pleasant or positive but the point is: I kept working. A human being can be very adaptable and resilient even if you have schizophrenia. If I quit every time someone laughed at me I wouldn’t have been at this janitor job for seven years. I’m just saying don’t give up too easily, problems are managable and people can be surprisingly forgiving. Good luck, I hope it works out tor you."
174385370,"I think time will tell. I don’t think I actually hear voices at all. I think I just have psychotic thoughts, I guess. I really read into them. I did actually suffer so freaking much. I had severe visual distortions and couldn’t feel or experience the external world outside my consciousness or mind. You’re definitely right that by posting the stuff I say here is not helping my recovery one bit. I just think I’m scared and talking on the internet helps me not be so scared. I’m guess I’m still alive. I’ve been through some hard stuff like mk ultra and people just can’t or won’t believe in it. They assume either it’s a conspiracy or that I’m delusional."

174385361,"I guess I get a calming sense, more relaxed feeling. I guess I’m less delusional and my thoughts are more logical, but that’s about it. Not sure if any of the meds help me. While off meds, I kept on getting “voices” or thoughts that I was Prot from the movie “KPAX” where I’m resistant/immune to medications like APs lol because I thought I was an alien/extraterrestrial haha. Sometimes, I doubt I’m from this planet and if I even have full blown schizophrenia or if it’s just a mild case or some other disorder like PTSD coupled with caffeine intoxication. Off the meds, I kept getting messages from past lives in other dimensions and ????. I kept thinking I was an extraterrestrial or something. I thought I could read people’s thoughts and memories or hear their private conversations. I’m just as miserable on meds. Sometimes, psychosis puts me in a fantasy world where I can be omnipotent and be whoever I want to be. It’s a way to escape, I guess. I’m more worried about my physica
l health and such like obesity. I worry about my looks. While off my meds, I just took 120 mg of Cymbalta, which is the max dosage. I guess I wonder if the reason I always go back to the hospital is not just because of positive symptoms but because of the depression and suicidal thoughts. They only let you go to the hospital if you have these kinds of thoughts. en.wikipedia.org K-PAX (film) K-PAX is a 2001 American-German science fiction-mystery film based on Gene _PERSON_ 1995 novel of the same name, directed by _PERSON_, starring _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_, and _PERSON_.

176169175,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:_PHONE_NO_ EndHTML:_PHONE_NO_ StartFragment:_PHONE_NO_ EndFragment:_PHONE_NO_ You aren’t really clear as to your sadistic motivations here. Are they sexual in nature or more general? It does make a big difference. Sexual sadism/masochism are volentarily controled. Each person has a limit, and those boundries are respected by others through the use of “safe words”. However; hurting, or wanting to hurt others outside of a consensual sexual or social relationship, could be a sign of a more seriuos condition. That being said, the more likely conclusion to draw from your brief outline is that, you’re just sort of “hitting back” as it were. That is to say, that you’re finding pleasure in “lashing out”, and that’s just a basic part of the human psychological makeup. When people feel pressure, they frequently “pop”. Like being nasty to the person behind the counter for being too slow, or too stupid. Road-rage is another common example, and let’s face it, you 
do feel “better” afterwards. It shifts the focus for you, if nothing else: “And I said to her…I mean, how did she even get the bloody job in the first place?!” You are the center of the Universe, not mine, but your own. You can make your own Universe the place that you want to live, or you can “go-with-the-flow” and see where it takes you. My choice was to change my Universe, then “go-with-the-flow” and it’s wonderful."

I’m with you on clinics. I do poorly in waiting rooms and I’m always early. My psydoc is always late so I spend an hour waiting easy every time and it’s so bland and sterile. Even the music is sterile to me and drives me nuts… So. Check in with your doc that your symptoms still are issues and try to get through that waiting room. I agree with _AT_MENTION_ headphones can be cool if you like your music or need a distraction!
174385377,"If I didn’t take meds I would be in a straight jacket in a rubber room. There is so much more to psychosis than paranoia, delusions and hallucinations. Active psychosis is the 3rd most disabling condition there is. I lose my memory and don’t even know what I am doing unmedicated. Not to mention the fact that I would also be actively suicidal at the same time. Not a good combination but there are varying degrees of symtomology amongst us all. Medication might help you.

174385385,"Hello, I am currently on 12.5mg of Olanzapine but sometimes I get akathisia(restlessness) on it. Usually when I experience stress is when the akathisia occurs. I was on 15mg for almost 4 months. Before that I took a high dose of Quetiapine(1600mg) but it failed to control my positive symptoms. My psychiatrist suggested to lower the Olanzapine dosage to 12.5mg and then to 10mg, to see if the akathisia will go away and so far it hasn’t. The day before yesterday I experienced restlessness again as I got stressed. Stress is a normal part of life and working, and I want to find work. I used to be able to work when I was on Quetiapine, as I had no akathisia(restlessness). My psychiatrist suggested two more options, namely Amisulpride(Solian) and Clozapine, but said that if I started Clozapine, I would have to be admitted to the day clinic for blood tests. If lowering the dosage of Olanzapine to 10mg doesn’t work, I’m considering trying the Amisulpride(Solian), as I’ve read that Cloazapine can hav
e a deadly side effect(reducing white blood cell count). I am taking 4mg extended release Akineton along with the Olanzapine, as it is supposed to control akathisia(restlessness) and it definetly helps, but when I’m stressed I still get restless. I would greatly appreciate any opinions on which drug you guys find best."

176169223,"So I’m still trying to work out why my father has suffered from asthma and how it relates to me. My father has stated on occasion that there are two many people in the world, a view he share’s with _NAME_. He has also made it clear that the problem is resource management, and that the U.S. and other first world countries consume too much to be sustainable. Indeed the scientific community of which he is a part state that the U.S. consumes five planets worth of resources every year as opposed to third world countries that consume less than half. My father consumes very little, far less than his neighbours, but he is not poor. From a solipsistic point of view, I believe he worries about planning for my future survival. My question is how does consumption relate to spiritual ideas of abundance;?; Is over consumption a violation of spiritual laws, or is there no such thing as over consumption;?; Is my father wrong to worry;?; This relates to me learning to budget, the purpose of which is to invest i

174385396,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Enhancement of the antipsychotic effect of risperidone by sodium nitroprusside in rats. _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology , Sep 2019 16 Recently, a single injection of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was found to induce a rapid and sustained antipsychotic effect in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Moreover, a single i.p. injection of SNP in rats was found to generate both rapid and persisting changes in brain synaptic plasticity, including enhanced excitatory postsynaptic current responses and spine morphology in layer V pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) brain slices. Here we used the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) test in rats to investigate the antipsychotic-like efficacy of SNP in combination with low-dose risperidone. In addition, we performed microdialysis experiments in freely moving rats to measure neurotransmitter ef
flux in the mPFC and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Risperidone caused only 20% suppression of CAR, which is far below the degree of CAR suppression required to predict a significant clinical antipsychotic effect. Addition of a low dose of SNP to risperidone dramatically enhanced the antipsychotic-like effect to a clinically relevant level. SNP significantly enhanced the risperidone-induced dopamine output in the mPFC but not in the NAc. The increased prefrontal dopamine release induced by the drug combination may also improve cognition as indicated by previous preclinical and clinical studies and, furthermore, via enhanced synaptic spine function and morphology in mPFC generate a both rapid and prolonged antipsychotic and pro-cognitive effect. Our results delineate SNP as a promising new treatment option for schizophrenia, including TRS, when added to currently available antipsychotic medication in order to improve efficacy at maintained or even reduced dosage."

Back in 01 I had been without any psych med for years. I went to see a psychologist who thought I had only OCD. Well she advised for me to get a prescription for Zoloft. I started taking the Zoloft, and I got much worse. I experienced paranoia, without resistance, and my OCD got way way worse. The OCD transformed into psychosis I think. I started thinking that Satan implanted blasphemous thoughts in my head, and that god was listening in, and thought they were my own thoughts. I prayed well over 1000 times a day, in every situation. I started to quarrel with an internal voice, out loud and in public. There were no relief from the Zoloft. I didn’t have any medical/psychological follow up and it was hidden signs from god everywhere. My then GF, got more and more worried and she had a psychiatrist come and see me. He said I had to quit the Zoloft, and that I ha
d schizophrenia. He prescribed a titration up to 1000 mg of Seroquel. I got way better. After that I was an outpatient at a policlinic and still had som minor OCD, but nothing much, but the new psychiatrist said I was depressed and I could use som Zoloft again. This time in addition to olanzapine. Nowadays I have few psychotic symptoms, but all the negative ones. I have a lot of anxiety and Obsessive thoughts. I see a psychiatrist now, and I suspect he doesn’t see the use in the Zoloft. Anybody with schizophrenia and OCD who have experience regarding this med combo?

Here too if follow with emotion its even more deadly. So the best way is to not rely on emotions or motivation instead think logically and follow the facts.

Later when I came home I read from the notes I had written earlier that I had a visible menu written in my head (that event was erased from my memory some time after writing the notes, and I didn’t remember it in the hospital).

I hated the people who said I was going to die thinking I wanted to hear this, They made me sound racist and perverted even I didn’t hear anything in my mind. I don’t understand _PERSON_ why does he want to murder and hurt other people. I am a pretty nice person, attractive, peaceful, I never thought I would di

Why did someone make me sound like and kept doing this to me becoming worse. _PERSON_ said that he had a show with _NAME_ on tv and he would describe to me or make me hear what was going on. These people, a woman, her husband, son, and daughter were pretty shady. I only knew what they were like by what they said like sounding like they are torturing someone. The woman was especially mean telling me she wanted me dead."

176169327,No. I have published my gospel and I have distributed it to churches in my area. I left the copies under their doors. I think they have read it. I haven’t discussed face to face

176169366,I was hospitalized for 2 days and came home yesterday. The mental hospital had a brilliant polish female doctor who lowered my clopixol from 400 mg every other week to 500 mg clopixol every 3 week to remove some of the negatives from conventional antipsychotic. My seroquel was upped with 100 mg and my ziprasidone was upped with 40 mg to improve my cognitive. The atypical are much more gentle than the old sideeffects wise. And the new antipsychotics are causing lot less negatives and cognitive issues than the conventional. Now I’m looking forward for a much brighter future.
174385427,I hate the selfies and whats for dinner posts I’d much rather discuss some of the mysteries that are schizophrenia.

I might have add so it could help me. I’m getting tested this year. In the beginning meds like risperdal and abilify slowed me down. Unfortunately, schizophrenia comes with cognitive decline like decreased IQ in some cases. Mine included. Nothing really there to fix the issue right now except getting stabilized first. My doctor told me I lost 10 IQ points. Felt like 20."
176169370,I can’t handle stress at all anymore. I’m not sure how to deal with that.
176169371,I imagine their advice will be to simply take it tomorrow Just incase you did indeed disolve and digest some of it already. Better to have not enough than too much can cause heart problems etc I wouldn’t take another one today
176169372,My life is better. Before psychosis I was 21 and doing drugs and hanging out with gangsters but it got worse and now I have real friends and I’m good and nice but I miss having a clear head and would love to not have to take meds but it’s not that bad and I just can’t function without them

My x was the best boyfriend I had had but we were not sexually compatible perhaps as we hardly had sex. My current boyfriend is the best sex I ever had but he has a hell temper, wants to control who I am “aloud” to have contact with, accused me of cheating often, has called me fat stomach etc My x boyfriend had female friends. I was not jealous of them. His best female friend knitted me socks and gave me a ring. I was a bit uncomfortable around her because of her nature but liked her anyway. I used to have heaps of male friends and back then my boyfriend had to accept it. Now I lost friends due to schizophrenia so don’t have any in person but believe I have in 
spirit. Seems like you are good to your girl friend. Good for her and good for you. I am aware to be cautious of some things with my boyfriend. I take the bad with the good. He has a lot of good. He can be so kind and generous and funny and having sex with him puts me in extacy but his badness is a worry and not ok to treat me like that but I behave as if it is ok to keep the peace n sometimes it’s better to smile and be quiet than start a fight.

176169438,"Yeah, remembering the doctors taking my son away from me makes me cry still. Not always, but if I’m already feeling depressed because I’m missing him that memory will usually bring tears. And the memory of my boyfriend’s face right before he threw me down the stairs the last time. I will never forget how happy he looked and how broken I felt. That’s the moment I gave up on myself and knew for sure this was how I was going to die.

I think its strange… Maybe I need more time on it … One doc was telling to me, that those who are at their worst, doesn’t feel their meds… And one of my ex pdocs was saying, that some need years to feel their meds… But yeah, it seems as a lie to me… Its been 3 years on Zyprexa… But it doesn’t put me to sleep. It doesn’t really open my appetite very well, no sedation, no fog, nothing… The only thing, that its sure, is that I am not in my bed with it, with my racing thoughts and in life danger… But for my mental state, its still not working very well… My mom keeps saying, that if meds were helping on 100%, there would be no ill people, but yeah… Maybe I want too much still from the meds? I wouldn’t bother you always, but my somatics are a big pain sometimes here… My soul literally hurts so much, that I get nauseous and need to lay down…"

Its very hard to be happy in life when you know your end result is going to be going to hell. Ill just do the best i can to ignore it and live my life nothing else i can do…"
176169450,Hoping med increase helps! I’m sorry you are going through this crap. This disease is not fair.
174385447,"Oh wow! .5 was what I’ve seen as a recommended starting point. So I was really thrown off when I was told to start at 2.5mg and then bump right up to 5mg after a couple days. My psych even said the next step would be up to 7.5 mg throughout the day. I don’t know how she expected me to function! Even on 2.5mg I’ve had to drink a ton of coffee and use ephedrine just to be somewhat human. The way she prescribed the meds seemed less like outpatient and more like being inpatient where you use anti psychotics to knock someone back into reality. Maybe she’s going by old school haldol rules where they regularly had very high doses. Now, as far as I can tell, recommendations seem to be to keep under 10 and try to never go above 30. How did you get your psych to agree to such a low dose? Just filled my Ability prescription, she prescribed 2.5mg which seems low to me. Maybe she is being cautious due to my haldol side effects. For right now I’m thinking of sticking to a lower dose of Haldol, no more 
than 2.5 mg, and starting on Abilify. Maybe using them together will let me keep the Haldol dose to something more manageable."
176169451,I read selfhelpbooks back in the days and joined a Christian community.

As long as we’re discussing ideas and not giving each other medical advice - an inevitable feature on a health forum - I’m always happy and OK with people arguing against my position (which I’m always willing to change anyway) About _NAME_’s argument I’d argue it’s a very rushed example of the use of the _PERSON_’s razor. 1.The idea that there is something inherently fishy about us being conceivably the last simulated world in a potentially near infinite chain of simulated worlds, and still struggling to create a simulated world of our own, is not a particularly robust one except as a description of a cognitive bias. You might as well call this argument the ‘anti-anthropic principle’. But even as a purely psychological argument it can be easily counteracted by a little anthropic principle of our own (and please don’t take this too seriously). The idea that only in an universe where we’ve failed to create a simulation of our own would we question 
on precisely those grounds the probability of us living in a simulation. Even if we accept _NAME_’s argument, it’s plain that all we have established is that probably we’re not living in a simulation, but we’ve not disproven at all the existence or even prevalence of simulated worlds, so it’s not clear what is gained. Why assume simulated are capable of creating simulated worlds of its own? The suspicious insistence on the inevitability of a single simulation spawning an infinite chain of simulations - which at the same time is presented as being self-defeating - is a formulation that reenacts classical epistemological conundrums. Even If only real real worlds can create simulated ones the chances of us living in a simulation are still very high. The Fun Argument. If we were to assume that real worlds are in the habit of creating simulated ones, and that these simulated worlds are unable - due to limits in the simulation or simply through the will of the people running the simulation-to create simul
ated worlds of their own, it would follow that our inability to create simulations practically proves that we live in one. There are plenty of other arguments but ultimately my own version of the simulation is based on a so called solipsistic and religious delusion, and therefore not easily amenable to a rational refutacion."

Welfare is all money that is paid to people from the government, as well as public services that improve general welfare such as health and education. I think it’s really weird that “welfare” has a negative connotation in the US. Helping people should be a good thing, right?"

It’s gotten rid of my psychosis but I feel it’s time for a change. Paxil and Wellbutrin both combat my depression pretty effectively. I don’t notice much of an effect from buspirone (it’s supposed to lower anxiety), maybe it’s just stealthy in the way it helps and I’d actually notice a difference if I stopped it? I dunno lol."

176169474,"The question I suppose I am asking is do we manifest the reality of sicknesses through the law of attraction or do they exist already? Life is infinite but incomplete, it is certainly worthy to help people in need, even if there are infinitely many of them, but the incompleteness of reality means that manifestation takes place, and thus by setting out to heal, we attract sickness, and manifest it, It is a never ending battle, but then that is the nature of life to some extent, I’m going to read up on how medicine is seen by various philosophies of how to live correctly and come to a decision, As I said, I seem to be being drawn to studying TCM theory, but the book on the art and practice of diagnosis put me off some what just by the sheer volume of material, I guess it is really for advanced students, and I am just beginning, The little _PERSON_ I have learned is relatively simple and inconsequential, I am happy with pursuing that for the time being, Thank you."

174385463,"I always thought it was quantum something with my thoughts like quantum entanglement or quantum superposition. I guess I’ve heard people say quantum entanglement before but I don’t know for sure. I’m not in the Illuminati. I had a delusion my step-grand father was, but I highly doubt it. Apparently, he was just a good normal guy, but I don’t know either. What would make a freemason join the Illuminati or make him one? Do you have to be 33rd degree or higher? I don’t know. I had a connection to him (my step-grand father). I think I got involved in some messed up ???? in college like a fake alien abduction while at school. Why would they target me? Why would they target a random college kid? I had a future. If this didn’t happen, I might not be schizophrenic and posting here. It seems I’m stuck in a time loop according to _PERSON_’s Razor because all other explanations are too complex and absurd. My memories and experiences point to a time loop right now, but I’ve probably been in a 
causal loop too. The point is to escape and live a better, normal life without suffering and without schizophrenia. I think the point is endless torment, torture, and suffering comparable to biblical hell or worse. _NAME_ talked about it. He said he was a clone and was a low ranking Illuminati member and was given information. Perhaps, I was in the Illuminati too in a distant past life, but I believe in a clean slate and tabula rasa aka a new life = past lives don’t matter or continue or at least so I hope… I don’t think I was merely born into it because of my step-grandfather. He married my grand mother at a late age so my father and his siblings don’t know ???? and he died before I grew up really. He was the only one in the family that had a college degree and he was a worshipful master I guess. He was second in charge at the lodge. I don’t believe anything at all that he was really in the Illuminati but I know more about freemasons than most because I believe I was a time traveler and _NAME_. I
ve seen, interacted with aliens and all sorts of bizarre demonic stuff. I only talk about it to get better. I know it’s real and not a mental illness and I don’t care if _NAME_ or _NAME_ on the forum don’t believe me. I’m here to get help. From what I recall, the Illuminati are only interested in people with a connection; if you can make them money; if you have potential, and if you know stuff. That’s pretty much it. You have to be born into it or have high potential like discover something that fundamentally changes society for better or worse. Something like a time machine or be one of the first. And maybe even change histroy, which I don’t recommend. They just like money. They want people (useless idiots) to make them millions or billions and then don’t give a ???? about them. They’re all about secrets and keeping them. They use fear and torture and it does honestly feel like hell or worse. That’s why I’m here. I had my consciousness uploaded and ?????? with honestly. I cannot speak fo
r anyone else and it’s highly unlikely you had anything going on with you… I feel like the Illuminati is a catch all term. Think of a giant spider web or nest. You got multiple factions and fronts. Honestly, if you’re just a random schizophrenic who smokes, they couldn’t care less. But I also feel they can give people schizophrenia with some advanced tech. I think that’s what happened to me for eternity. I think it’s because I am the real _NAME_ aka time traveler. I was cloned most likely and given schizophrenia I think. In my past lives, I was taken to _NAME_ and other bases and mental hospitals and stuff and had a horrible hell like existence thousands or millions of times or more. In a way, I don’t believe in Hell. I sometimes rather go to Biblical hell than have schizophrenia. I hate mental illness and wish it was cured so I could have a life I always wanted. There’s this famous guy I’ve watched for some time who claims he was targeted by the Illuminati in these projects or programs call
ed the SSP (Secret Space Program). I thought I related. He’s a big guy in the community. Well respected and been through a lot. He said he insulted an Illuminati member’s son and they had aliens abduct him and put him in a 20 year and back program as a slave and then wiped his memory. Feels pretty legit to me as I have similar memories. I would say there are some Satanic elements to the Illuminati/Monarch programs because of aliens and demons and stuff. I think that’s all I know. I’m saying this because I believe this is real and it might be helpful. It’s definitely real to me because I experienced it and live it and know it. I have memories and really did die and came back alive and more…"
176169488,I had to have my girlfriend call me into work because i cant leave my house and got too anxious to call myself.

Plus it was really stormy and leaves were blowing everywhere. I got really scared and felt like someone was following me.

I have bad luck Anyways I’m to continue on Abilify 20mg even if the Caplyta does go through. I’m supposed to take both and then we will talk about it in 4 weeks.

Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind.

176169637,"Time travel is a tricky one. Im not sure it is possible, since from a mechanical standpoint, it would involve a net reversal of entropy in the universe to go back to a previous state. We know that it is impossible to make anything travel faster than the speed of light, including information , which means that the molecules we are made of and the knowledge we possess cannot instantaneously travel to a point in the past because space is linked to time and vice versa. It would be like teleportation essentially, which is in fact possible based on what I explained earlier, but impossible to control or predict. In fact, its likely that sub-atomic particles time travel spontaneously all the time. I think it is possible, however, to create or visit another universe where things have happened exactly the same until the point in time that youve traveled to, assuming a multiverse exists where infinite universes with infinite timelines have occurred. I like to call this the “time plane” of our universe, si
nce it is essentially 2D time (if we imagine time as a straight line, 2D time would be a “flat piece of paper” of time, where the extra dimension represents different quantum probabilities of the same universe). 3D time would then be infinite universes completely different from our own (i.e. different starting parameters and different laws of physics) with their own 2D sets of infinite timelines based on this quantum probability. Then we could “stretch” this sheet of paper so that one time in one universe matches up to a different time in a different universe with the same laws of physics as our own, and the exact same outcome. It would take an enormous amount of energy though, probably far greater than that produced by our own sun. But yeah, could be possible to do this version of time travel, though it wouldnt be technically going back in time. Hope this long winded explanation makes things clear.

A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Dec 2019 06 Negative symptoms of schizophrenia have a great impact on patients' functioning and are among the most important contributors to subject's disability. However, few studies have assessed the role of type and severity of symptomatology of schizophrenia on the psychiatric care resource utilization. We investigated if the clinical profile of patients at discharge from an index hospitalization might be associated with a different use of psychiatric care resources in the subsequent 1-year period in a large population of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Clinical records of 450 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders admitted in an 
acute psychiatric inpatient service and subsequently followed in the outpatient services of the same Department were reviewed. Patients with more severe negative symptoms at discharge from hospital showed a higher number and duration of hospitalizations in the 1-year follow-up, as well as a higher number of rehabilitative residential admissions than patients with milder severity of negative symptoms. The same was true for patients with predominant negative symptoms. A global resource utilization index indicated a higher use of psychiatric resources in patients with higher severity of negative symptoms. In conclusion, showing moderate to severe negative symptoms versus positive symptoms at discharge from a hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia spectrum disorder does predict a higher use of psychiatric care resources. This underlines the importance of relieving negative symptoms even in the acute phase of treatment and the need to develop more effective treatments for this symptom dimension

176169670,"I don’t believe in hell because by default, many mentally ill and poor ppl will automatically go to hell and that’s not fair. Many poor have no other choice than stealing or to die. Some mentally ill commit murders and suicide because of their severe symptoms. God should be fair. It’s the law’s job to stop murders, theft, rape, etc, not religion. Religion should be 100% positive and not negative like hell. I believe that everyone is going to heaven no matter what. This makes life much easier. Hell just makes people and their lives miserable from my experience. I lost my “faith” since God’s voice told me to kill myself and I was close to die from liver failure according to drs in the emergency. I was diagnosed with sz after they transferred me from the emergency to mental hospital. I told my psy that I was Jesus and I can do miracles."

Now I’m coming around and trying to make a new go of it."

176169679,"After posting I went through and cleaned up the word flow, commas, periods and swearing. Are there any other forums you guys might suggest for this writing?"
176169680,I really can’t function like this. I am chronically fatigued 24/7 My psychiatrist decreased my risperidone dose by 1 mg. Honestly that’s not enough. But I’m afraid that I’ll become psychotic if I go too low.
176169682,"That fear of dying is not actually a bad thing. Just don’t dwell on the thought of impending doom. Instead, maintain yourself occupied, not preoccupied. Meaning, stay busy and don’t worry about being busy. Find a hobby, a chore that might benefit someone you care about. Small steps, I’m not saying to go out and get a _NAME_ Benz for your relatives, I am saying, wash the dishes, or wash your dish, clean up after yourself when you eat at a table if food has been spilt. Clean the table, or stack the plates if you are at a restaurant. The waiter/waitress will find it much easier to take them back. The cups same thing, the busboy/busser won’t have to shine the table for a tip and if you can afford it, leave a tip for those who attended you. You can even say something aloud like, “Wow, the food is delicious, I sometimes think about where it came from, thank goodness for the hands that brought it here, from the soil/field to the table, the cook/chef/restaurant people are kind/deserve to be thank
ed/I [almost] feel unworthy of this.” Any combination or even contemplation of that or action is worth speaking or sharing."
176169683,fade to black very true statement.
176169684,Just curious? I think I read this somewhere not sure though?
176169685,Are you making big improvements?
174385518,I think negative symptoms cannot be cured. However you can significantlly ameliorate them by working on glutamatergic mechanisms . This can be done with clozapine and D-serine. Also low doses amisulpride increases dopaminergic neurotransmission. Besides being GHB receptor agonist this is how amisulpride in combination with clozapine makes my negatives very mild - unnoticable. Wellbutrin counteracts sedation and weight gain from clozapine and improoves cognition in schizoprenia free of positive symptoms.
176169686,I can remember thinking about this in high school sitting around stoned lol and being afraid of rejection I felt I did not fit into changing society. In the 60s there was a big push to be cool. I was so hung up with fear that I felt I wasn’t. But pot kept me away from doing well in school and the straight kids who did. People weren’t accepting if you looked like a hippy or looked stoned. Now I’m still not acceptable to half the population it seems. But I can handle it. I don’t get arrested lol or anything if I’m not doing something illegal. But as soon as I started disobeying my parents I got guilty. That was hard to get through. But I went the whole other way and got some kool and got some straight. Guilt kept me from going that way. Nothing wrong with guilt.
176169687,I think it does. I can’t blame it all on the sza but one of the last things i remember my ex saying to me was “I don’t know how to fix you.” So there’s that.
176169688,I get like that too. Its terrible. .y thoughts are so jumbled right now…
176169689,I got mine at 19 after my 3rd attempt. I’ve had it ever since with no problems except a few speeding tickets over the 30 plus years. I now only drive 25 mph or so. No more tickets for me.
176169690,look at Jesus he never got paid
174385519,"I agree! It’s sad to say this but I don’t think it’s because they see a little of themselves in us! I’m not speaking about everyone but I think most people are scared of people with this illness. Yes, there are compassionate and empathetic people, but if they see someone with this illness who is having an episode, psychosis, think they’re god, paranoid so bad that they think the government or people are watching them they most likely would rather be anywhere else then around that person. Family is different as they have unconditional love, but the every day person is more than likely uncomfortable. I’m sure in time it will change. I remember when people didn’t even want to be in the same room with people with AIDS and Cancer thinking they would catch it. Of course people don’t think they can catch schizophrenia or other MI, but they are still uncomfortable or scared. I have hope that one day this changes."

176169703,"My stance is YES. Yes, you can. It happens to me a lot. Intellectually I know the delusions aren’t real while they’re happening, but they feel so real, i can’t “believe” they’re not. So much so that repeating “they’re not real, they’re not real” doesn’t even help… In fact, saying “I wish this delusion would stop,” indicates you know it’s a delusion, but it still terrifies you enough to want it to leave your mind. How is it different from knowing you have schizophrenia, while still being psychotic?"

176169793,No I wanted to be hospitalized. Then when I wanted to leave after a couple bad experiences on the ward they fully committed me because I was considered a danger to myself

176169803,Yesterday I bought some new clothes at a Big and Tall Men’s section of a local store. It was expensive but necessary as I needed some long sleeve shirts for the coming cold wave. It wasn’t that long ago that I was on the ketogenic diet and had lowered my weight to where I wore 42 shorts but now I wear 52 pants after I quit it due to extreme heartburn and couldn’t come up with an alternative. There was a show in the US where the host warned that weight gain was rapid when you quit that diet and it certainly was true with that. After putting the 4X shirts in the closet I tossed out a 2X shirt. It’s the price of the solitude my meds give me and the yo-yo dieting I have done over the years to try to deal with their side effects.
176169804,"I am slowly putting weight on too. A pound here and a pound there. I go up and down all the time but slowly, I’m inching upwards. It’s very, very frustrating. I watch my calories like a hawk and I exercise every single day and it doesn’t work! I really don’t know what to do. And I thought I had it all figured out. I don’t anymore. Additional things I’m going to try: Eating from 10 am to 6 pm only. Climbing flights of stairs three times every day. Practicing piano for one whole hour, six times a week, every week. Absolutely quitting the diet pop."

176169816,I voted yes on the poll.
176169817,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. I almost tagged you upfront for support. Prodromal is just preliminary schizophrenia to my understanding. If identified in real time treatment can be more effective too.

176169820,I did anxiety exposure training on YouTube videos of running showerheads and people taking showers etc. Took a few months of exposure but finding it much easier to take showers now. I think that the fear of washing is a gradually learned fear in Sz patients and that it can be unlearned.

174385558,I basically just want to vent… I feel like no one I know understands what it’s like to hear voices every single day for 6 years. My schizophrenia was brought on by heavy drug use I did in my 20s. I basically just want to give up some days while other days I’m there talking to the voices thinking they are spirits. I don’t understand how I can have such a hardcore delusional belief while the rest of me is so rational. I am new to this forum and figured I should start talking to other people with schizophrenia. No one knows how hard it is for me to live with the reality that I ruined my brain with drugs. It’s a harsh reality and I think about it everyday. I just want to be normal again and get married to my boyfriend with our wedding day without hearing voices that haunt me.

(like if you’re having a blood test for a disease and have a positive result) It’s harder to diagnose an SZ patient because of the negative symptoms, they look like a lot of other things like depression or just feeling down in general.

174385583,"# Beyond Plaques and Tangles: Genetic Variation May Increase Risk of Cognitive Decline A genetic variation in some people may be associated with cognitive decline that can’t be explained by deposits of two key proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid ? and tau, according to a study published in the September 16, 2020, online issue of Neurology . The genetic variation leads to alterations in the metabolism of glutathione, an antioxidant, and may be associated with thinning of the cortex of the brain, the study says. The variation is found on the sixth chromosome. This is interesting because one medication being investigated in schizophrenia is L-acetylcysteine, which allegedly also increases the levels of glutathione in the brain."

174385590,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Prediction of Onset of Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder and Its Progression to Schizophrenia in a Swedish National Sample. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The American journal of psychiatry , May 2019 06 The objective of this study was to clarify the etiology of substance-induced psychotic disorder and its progression to schizophrenia in a Swedish national sample.Individuals with a registration of substance-induced psychotic disorder between 1997 and 2015 in national medical registries (N=7,606) were followed up for a mean of 84 months. Data from medical, criminal, and pharmacy registries on first-degree through third-degree relatives were used to calculate familial risk scores for nonaffective psychosis, drug abuse, and alcohol use disorder.Individuals with substance-induced psychotic disorder had large elevations in standardized familial risk scores for drug abuse (+1.09, 95% CI=1.02, 1.15) and alcohol use disorder (+0.98, 95% CI=0.93, 1.03) and modest elevations f
or nonaffective psychosis (+0.35, 95% CI=0.30, 0.41). The cumulative risk for progression to schizophrenia was 11.3%; it was lowest for alcohol-induced and highest for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, and it was predicted by early age at diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder, male sex, and further registrations for episodes of drug abuse, alcohol use disorder, and substance-induced psychotic disorder. A risk prediction model found that 47% of individuals who converted to schizophrenia were in the upper 20% of risk. Familial risk scores for drug abuse and alcohol use disorder did not significantly discriminate those who converted to schizophrenia from those who did not, while familial risk score for nonaffective psychosis did (0.67, 95% CI=0.40, 0.95, versus 0.33, 95% CI=0.28, 0.39). Familial risk scores for nonaffective psychosis were indistinguishable between individuals with schizophrenia with and without prior substance-induced psychosis. Assignment of early retirement by the Swedish Social 
Insurance Agency strongly discriminated between individuals with substance-induced psychotic disorder with and without later schizophrenia.Substance-induced psychotic disorder appears to result from substantial drug exposure in individuals at high familial risk for substance abuse and moderately elevated familial risk for psychosis. Familial risk for psychosis, but not substance abuse, predicts progression from substance-induced psychosis to schizophrenia. Schizophrenia following substance-induced psychosis is likely a drug-precipitated disorder in highly vulnerable individuals, not a syndrome predominantly caused by drug exposure."

I have been somewhat lazy with such things because i was burn out. My boss today actually commented on me looking good and smelling fresh (after i told him i was too stressed out to work or do housework). Im mortified - he wouldnt say that if i always did. Also, i feel my dancing teacher looked subtly disturbed when she came close. I just dont know how to behave with these people at all.

I know it’s technically a form of self-harm and I know it’ll hurt afterwards. I’m not doing it to hurt myself though. I do it because I’m not sure what else to do. I just want it to stop. Other times I just get random urges to do it. I don’t understand why and I feel as though I am going crazy. I don’t understand why my brain…if this brain is mine has turned against me.

176169961,"i dont know why im venting, i dont know why i feel compelled to. i want to just bottle it up, but i have for months. ive told all this to my roommate but it didnt make me feel better, so i waited to try and bottle it, and now i need to let it out again. i have maybe 3 friends total (not including roommate) but i dont feel comfortable sharing any of this with them. (_USER_ID_ comment: this was supposed to be way shorter and concise, but i dont think that deleting it would be a good idea) for over a year, i have been hellbent on proving that someone who cut contact with me is still trying to mess with my life, because im so convinced that they still love me because they promised they would, this is just a sick joke to get back at me for how i hurt them. for example, my roommate just cracked his toes and i think it has something to do with that person. its bothering me, to the point where i get so worked up i cant think on drawing for work or anything, not even my bird. life is so overwhelming already 
that i just go outside without telling my roommate or i try to avoid him, but he always catches me and brings me back in somehow, which often feels like hours of him trying to convince me, or he just picks me up because im maybe 30% of his height and weight. i cant even remember what i think about before i go, during or anything, its so fuzzy. _PERSON_ tried to go outside every day for maybe two weeks now. i just want to walk somewhere, but he wont let me go anywhere without supervision, and i just want to be alone. hes also super worried because im walking, and im supposed to be in my wheelchair because thats what my last two doctors have told me is better for my health. but i just get so pumped full of adrenaline that i just, have to go. he says he can tell when i want to go outside because i get a big grin on my face, but i dont even notice im grinning. i wish my face cooperated so id be less suspicious. for the past almost a month, hes been sleeping in the same room as me because hes concerned ill go outs
ide again. i feel like a trapped animal. its baffling to me how my adrenaline functions when i want to go outside but not when i need food. my roommate is the one who gets me food because without adrenaline, i can only crawl or scoot and their house is two stories and im staying on the top floor. i tried to go once at 4 am, i had taken literally hours of trying to convince him to sleep in his own room because he didnt need to worry about me. i waited a bit then i got excited and i started going downstairs. i stopped halfway because something didnt feel right, and as i felt it, he turned on his _USER_ID_. he promised me he would be in his bed, but he went to the bottom floor by the front door to sleep incase i wanted to go outside. then again, i promised i would just go to sleep, but being outside was way more enticing to me. it still is as i type this, but hes laying on the floor in front of me and im tired of the arguing. i went outside today while he was in the kitchen. i walked father than i had ever gotte
n, but he ran in front of me and he wouldnt let me past. our conversation ranged wildly in topics, but it felt like mostly him telling me how much he valued me or how i made his life better and that petrie my bird is worried about me. i just wanted to go on a walk, and he wouldnt let me do it unless he came with. im an introvert, i like being alone. hes not a mean person, but he feels really controlling and manipulative. hes open minded when he makes mistakes and wants to do better, and i try to do the same for him. ive never experienced someone who doesnt get angry at me for asking them to not say xyz thing or how one behaviour could be problematic, or telling them that something they did hurt me. i try to be supportive to him, but its wearing me out being around him all the time. i was supposed to move in with my uncle that lives 12 hours or so away, but i heard through the family tree that he was getting a plot of land with a mobile home instead, meaning that i couldnt move in with him. we were going to ru
n the family paint store, but i think he just wants nothing to do with me and im too afraid to ask. he was really supporting of my girlfriend, who unfortunately turned rapidly abusive once i moved in with her. hes gay and been unmarried, i think hes religious and chooses not to engage in a relationship because hes close with homophobic family and the church. so this means that because i dont have a job, i lost my license because of my medical conditions, and i cant access the files i need to apply for disability, i cant get a loan to prove i can pay it back so i can buy a house. i cant even rent. im stuck. my roommate keeps trying to show me all the ways we can solve the problems i have, like getting a house with mutual friends, or together, but its not registering as a solution because its not a 100% guarantee that ill be safe and housed with my bird. what if one day they decide that im too ‘crazy’ to deal with and then im homeless and i lose my bird? i love my bird, he makes me so happy. my bird is so i
ncredibly intelligent. he refuses to learn tricks and repeating phrases, and chooses to pick up words for conversations. he asks so many questions, he learned to conjugate without being explicitly taught, and im just so proud. hes been through so much abuse and hes still such an amazing baby bird. i would definitely say hes smarter than me i feel like im getting worse than i ever have been. i hate comparing the present to past of my life, but its just been a toilet bowl of shitty thing after shitty thing with maybe a few plateaus. my pain is worse. my digestion is worse. my ability to take care my hygiene is worse. my attention span is worse. im tired of reliving memories. sometimes, im really tired of breathing. im tired of being in a wheelchair. im tired of not being let to go outside. im tired of being scared. im tired of being petrified at the thought that my roommate might r*pe me for so many reasons that i dont feel comfortable to rant about, im so exhausted of everything. i feel like im still responsib
le for every little mistake, all the things i have and havent fixed, i just think i shouldnt have done them or let them happen in the first place. i feel really idiotic and stupid, i feel like my art is getting progressively worse and that maybe its not worth doing. i cant socialize right, never have been able to, and its just getting to me now that i can actually feel excited to talk to people. tl;dr - im believing these random things when i have no proof, my physical and mental health is getting worse, and my roommate wont leave me out of their sight. whether or not someone reads this, i hope that everyone here and your familiars have a week that brings you much deserved happiness and wellbeing!"

174385619,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Medication-Induced Akathisia with Newly Approved Antipsychotics in Patients with a Severe Mental Illness: A Systematic Review and _NAME_-Analysis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, CNS drugs , May 2019 07 Akathisia is a common and distressing movement disorder that can be associated with the use of antipsychotics. It is characterized by a subjective (inner restlessness) and an objective (excessive movements) component. Akathisia can have a negative impact on clinical outcome and even lead to treatment discontinuation. Although medication-induced akathisia is more commonly associated with the use of first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), it also occurs with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), including the newly approved antipsychotics (NAPs) asenapine, lurasidone, iloperidone, cariprazine, and brexpiprazole. Until now, no _NAME_-analysis has been published on the risk of akathisia for all NAPs, as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment, in patients with a severe mental 
illness.The primary objectives of this systematic review and _NAME_-analysis were to (i) compare akathisia incidence rates of the NAPs, as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment, in adult patients with a severe mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder), using data from published and unpublished randomized controlled trials; and (ii) examine the role of several study characteristics explaining differences in akathisia incidence rates between studies.A systematic literature search, using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases (until October 2018), was conducted for English-language placebo- as well as active-controlled clinical trials, including subjective (percentage of patients reporting akathisia) and/or scale-defined medication-induced akathisia incidence rates with NAPs (as monotherapy or as adjunctive treatment) in adult patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder. Additional unpublished clinical trials were identified thr
ough the ClinicalTrials.gov electronic database. Two _NAME_-analyses (incidence rates and odds ratio [OR] [placebo vs. active] of medication-induced akathisia with NAPs) were performed to obtain an optimal estimation of akathisia risks of adult patients with a severe mental illness under these treatment conditions and to assess the role of study characteristics.Two hundred and thirteen reports were selected as potentially eligible for our _NAME_-analysis. Of these, 48 met the inclusion criteria. Eight records, identified through the ClinicalTrials.gov database and cross-referencing, and which fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were added, resulting in a total of 56 records (iloperidone?=?5, asenapine?=?11, lurasidone?=?15, brexpiprazole?=?13, cariprazine?=?12). The estimated weighted mean incidence rate of akathisia was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-9.1), with estimates being 3.9% (95% CI 2.4-6.3) for iloperidone, 6.8% (95% CI 5.1-9.0) for asenapine, 10.0% (95% CI 7.4-13.5) for brexpiprazole, 12.7% (9
5% CI 10.1-16.1) for lurasidone, and 17.2% (95% CI 13.4-22.1) for cariprazine. After Tukey-adjustment for multiple testing, the incidence rate of akathisia was significantly (p?"

Personally, I enjoy the rain, and I enjoy dark things more than light things. So I wouldn’t say rain is Evil, but I do think that there is a dark mood of chaos, anarchy and a sinister emotion attached to the rain. In reality, rain is an amazing natural bringer of life, some people prayer for rain or they can’t live."

Before we got married he threw lukewarm tea in his sister’s face and his eldest sister got cops in to take him to hospital. I only found this out after we got married Then after we married he said he threatened his mom and brother with a knife - not to hurt them but to scare them. But also threatened tenant’s wife with knife and accidentally cut her hand. This because his tenant wasn’t paying. He slapped me across face once and I witnessed him attack his father twice on two separate occasions. Also on one of those occasions (last Friday when he had psychosis breakdown) he attacked his father again and I heard his father cry. He attacked his uncle that night too - and his uncle has had heart attacks a few months ago. He was paranoid about them being in plot to rob him but the knife incidents was more because he claimed his mother/brother/tenant wasn’t listening to him. But it isn’t excuse and I’ve drawn the line.

Some doctors believe in keeping the dose the same (at the highest level), others think it can be lowered over a period of time. I was on 800 Seroquel. It was giving me side effects. Now I am at 600. I am doing better, I have more doubt. I will talk with my PDoc in a few days and he may lower the dose further. This is his way of working. Other doctors told me I couldn’t get off Clozapine. I was taking 800 mg a day (partial response) with a second medication. Now I am off Clozapine. Seroquel was increased to max dose, now it will become half in time I hope.

My family was trying to kill me n pretended to live next Someone would be paid ten million dollars to marry me but they would not love me they would only marry me for the money and they would cheat on me. I thought I was a billionaire. I thought my x was _NAME_.he is a man. I thought my family was not my real family and they were getting paid to pretend they love me. I had voices and gunshots n moans 24/7. I thought my real father was a Muslim so I changed my name and became a Muslim for a year and I love my dad and have to try change my name back now.

I may be willing to give it another try now that I understand that the voices will never completely go away. Back then the fact that Risperdal lowered the voices for me was a plus. I might have been better off increasing my haldol and paying $4 a bottle for it rather than going on SSI to pay for the Risperdal. I might have had a closer to normal life.

174385686,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Predictors of overall and mental health-related internet use in adults with psychosis. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Psychiatry research , May 2019 20 As digital interventions are beginning to be developed to support self-management of psychosis, it is important to understand how illness-related and individual factors may affect internet use and engagement with digital mental health resources among people with psychotic disorders. This study aimed to identify demographic, clinical, and personal variables associated with overall and mental health-related internet use in a sample of 189 adult community mental health service users with nonaffective and affective psychotic disorders. Among participants who regularly used the internet (87.3%), most (67.9%) reported using the internet for mental health information. Higher frequency of overall internet use was predicted by younger age, completion of post-secondary education, and less severe negative symptoms. 
Internet use for mental health information was predicted by younger age, higher levels of overall internet use, current productive employment, and higher loneliness. This study is the first to quantitatively examine how clinical and personal measures relate to overall and mental health-related internet use in people with psychosis. Although cognitive difficulties and negative symptoms impacted overall internet use, these disorder-related difficulties did not further impact internet use for mental health information. Digital mental health resources should be designed to optimise engagement for this population."

176170243,"Hey, we’re on the same side but my advice to schizophrenics is to do the normal things you have control of. Sure, acting normal is a thankless endeavor a lot of the time. But it’s no use giving so-called “normies” more ammunition to treat you badly or look down on you. _USER_ID_ and ignorance are real so my opinion on the shoe incident is that adults don’t generally walk outside there home barefoot. It takes two minutes to put on shoes or it takes three minutes to dress appropriately or it’s best to keep groomed and with a haircut. You have control over things like those (and many other things). There’s a lot in the world you have no control over but doing certain simple things could make your life easier."

I’ll make a topic about it sometime in the future. I have thoughts about _NAME_ my enemies, except those who I want to torture are just remaining imposters of people from the past who have no connection with me now and have no idea of any of this.

I refuse to ever interact with my brother again, and I think it’s awful that they keep inviting him when they know what he’s done. They think I’m a disgrace because I won’t just forgive him and let it go. But in order to forgive someone, they actually have to be sorry and try to make amends. And the only way he could make amends is by turning himself into thet cops and spending the rest of his life in jail. Then, I might forgive him. But he’s not sorry. He just doesn’t want to face the consequences of his actions."

176170472,I had severe panic disorder before my sza developed - it was my four year prodromal phase. Had it all through high school before my breakdown. As time went on and I was on meds the panic attacks went less. But nowadays I still get them occasionally several times a month. Once in 2011 I had a panic attack that lasted for three hours. It seemed that that was the beginning of my relapse into sza the following year. Since then I’ve been on meds. I found the best remedies for panic attacks is deep slow breathing and prayer and positive self talk. Also if I need it I take a valium or Ativan

There were lots of factors - pleasure, comfort, feeling loved, rebellion.- that entered into the equation. But I couldn’t get Mom to understand that.

I’m on 7.5mg daily Zyprexa and it glues everything together so instead of being panicked, I’m just bored like I used to be whenever I was unemployed. I had to go through lots of other antipsychotics to land on this one though and the others all gave me side effects ranging from annoying to horrifying, but I was able to land on this one about three years after my break and things have been mostly calm ever since, no hospitalizations or major side effects. I hope you get the help you need, you strike me as someone who either downplays or effectively hides your symptoms to a degree. Psychiatrists are not great mind readers and sometimes they are in a confident happy mood and become minimalists. It’s happened to me in the past with other doctors."

My type 2 diabetes started when I went on anti-psychotics (Olanzapine, Abilify, Risperdal) and I gained about 60 pounds. I’m really concerned about diabetes killing me in the next 5 years or so. Meanwhile I’m late onset and although schiz symptoms started in my teens I wasn’t treated until 12 years ago. I plan on asking my psychiatrist to take me off anti-psychotics (Risperidone) tomorrow because I want the diabetes to stop. Is that a mistake? _PERSON_ Haven’t had positive symptoms for years.

176170550,"Jumping right into full-time work seems a bit much. It might be better to start off smaller and work you’re way up. This is probably better advice for someone who has a cushion of time to explore more options. When I got out of the hospital in 1983 and moved into a group home, I became employed again through a series of small steps. I started small and slowly took on more responsibility and challenges. 9 months later I got a regular job and ended up staying there four years, despite being occasionally psychotic, heavily sedated, stressed, and for the last year I was addicted to crack. It wasn’t always full time, it was usually part-time but for long periods they had me work full time. I’ve been employed almost steadily since. Some jobs required me to work full time, but not always. I have usually risen to the occasion on my jobs. I do what is asked. It would be ideal If you had the luxury and time to start part-time and slowly build up your confidence and stamina to work full time."

176170584,"During my SSI hearing my dad said that he was the one who pulled down the fire alarms because I thought they were bugged by the gov. and the thing is we had just come back from a vacation and I saw the fire alarm hanging down from the ceiling, and a bunch of stuff was in random places. Now I think it really was a person messing with me and not anything else. Either my x boyfriend or someone sketchy. My x boyfriend said he was a narc for the gov. and had lists of papers that he had ratted out all these people that’s how he got good on the cops. He said he sat in a cop car when they arrested someone who had wronged him. But he makes up stories all the time just to mess with me. He was never really my boyfriend. I feel like he was a fake person like an NLP. Someone who is set up to destroy someone, like a sleeper cell. The “_NAME_ Show” was a disturbing movie. So was the Matrix if you think about it, and listening to too much trap music. So the odd thing is my dad told me I was the one who pulle
d out all the fire alarms and then at the hearing he admitted to it, then I come home and my mom said she did it because she thought the fire alarms were bugged. So like everyone got rid of the fire alarms. I’ve been targeted by gov. people ever since my mom protested torture and something to do with latin america and coffee farmers. I don’t think reality is a simulation. I believe there are bad people in the world who want good people scared and trapped in perpetual fear and delusion.

176170588,"The delusions are indeed different, depending on the culture you grew up in. People in a post 9/11 American society tend to have more delusions about government surveillance, people in eastern Asian countries tend to have delusions about being guided by the spirits of their ancestors, people in western countries tend to have delusions of gangstalking and mind control. It all comes down to what that society says about spirituality/supernatural forces and common fears."

I’m in your same situation, I gotta look after myself, because like I said, its hard. It ain’t over. Its hard, but I still got hope. I think you do too.

174385772,"I think it would be helpful if those of us who have reached a prolonged period of stabilization could reach how we got there and how long it took us. I’ll make a little timeline. -First major psychotic episode at age 16 but had had symptoms of psychosis since forever -With help of a friend, I began to gain some insight and wonder if I was mentally ill around age 17 -Sought help from school psychologist at age 17, too scared to talk about my psychosis just talked about depression -First saw a therapist age 18 again didn’t talk about psychosis -Age 19 finally open up about what I suspected were psychotic symptoms, was diagnosed with an unspecified psychotic disorder, the diagnosis for me really solidified that yes, I had psychosis, but was too scared of medication to try it -Age 20: Dx changed to major depression w psychotic features, finally try medication -Age 22: Dx changed to schizoaffective -Age 23: Finally found good medication combo that gave me no side effects, took away 99% of my symptom
s and made remaining 1% mild and infrequent, very stable at this point -Age 24: still stable and doing well! So in summary My recovery took -1 year after first major psychotic episode with outside help to gain insight -3 years after first major psychotic episode and an official diagnosis to confirm to me that I had a psychotic disorder -5 years of therapy to help recognize triggers, patterns in illness, build coping mechanisms -3 years to find the right med combo -And involved 3 changes in DX In total it took me 8 years after my first major psychotic episode to recover. I do consider myself recovered at this point as I have had no major issues for around a year now."

It is just two weeks of tough craving and then you break the back of nicotine addiction. Stretching it out by having patches, lozenges or vaping just prolongs the agony. People act like it is the hardest thing in the world. It isn’t and writing a long justification for your addiction doesn’t do anything but fall flat on its face. If you don’t want to die do something about it and just bloody quit. Be a man/woman and take hold of your destiny. It is just two weeks and then it is beaten!"
