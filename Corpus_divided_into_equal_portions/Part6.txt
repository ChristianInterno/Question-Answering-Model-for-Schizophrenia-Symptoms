The considerable clinical heterogeneity in schizophrenia makes elucidation of its neurobiology challenging. Subtyping the disorder is one way to reduce this heterogeneity and deficit status is one such categorization based on the prominence of... We aimed to utilize diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to identify unique white matter cerebral changes in deficit schizophrenia (DS) compared with non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS) and healthy controls (HC) in an Asian sample. A total of 289 subjects (111 HC, 133 NDS and 45 DS) underwent DTI and completed rating scales which assessed the severity of psychopathology, psychosocial functioning and premorbid intelligence. The identified brain white matter changes especially in the PTR relate to deficits of cognitive control and emotional awareness, which may underlie psychopathology associated with deficit status like inattention and affective blunting. These pote
ntial biomarkers of DS warrant further examination to determine their utility for monitoring illness progression and intervention response in schizophrenia. Since its first proposal by _PERSON_. (_PERSON_ 1988), there is evidence that patients with deficit schizophrenia (DS) present with distinct symptom profiles exhibiting more severe anhedonia and anergia than those with non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS) (_NAME_ and _PERSON_ 2008), suffer from poorer neuropsychological functioning with impaired social cognition and verbal fluency (_PERSON_ 2017), have increased likelihood of family history of schizophrenia (_PERSON_ 1998), display structural and functional neurobiology differences such as altered cerebral blood flow (_NAME_ and _PERSON_ 2008), and face poorer long-term outcomes with low likelihood of disease remission (_PERSON_ 2010). In conclusion, we found that FA reductions especially involving the right posterior thalamic radiation are associated with the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia. These findings 
represent potential brain white matter biomarkers of DS which deserve further investigation to determine their utility for monitoring illness progression and response to intervention in deficit schizophrenia. One commonly reported DTI index, fractional anisotropy (FA), is a quantitative measure of WM tract microstructure (_PERSON_ 2002), with areas of sparse, poorly myelinated, or divergent fibers displaying lower FA values (_PERSON_ 2018). The disconnection hypothesis (_PERSON_ 1998) posits abnormal connectivity between brain regions and white matter (WM) organization disturbances as the key pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia (_PERSON_ 2016)."

175931317,"Personally, I feel these symptoms present themselves different in not only the individual but the situation the individual is living in. I guess if a specific type of hallucination or delusion repeatedly presents itself, it may be possible to diagnose that patient and further classify the type of symptom or illness it is. Then, at that point, these symptoms can be compared and worked through. Also, it is my personal opinion that there are internal and external factors that are difficult to distinguish AND much overlap between the different disorders. I feel that diagnosis is only one component towards healing and progress, but also these specific symptoms may be most difficult to share because many of them are fear based but could also be from external or physical reasons‚Ä¶. or both."

175931332,L-Tyrosine supplement felt a little like Concerta it was nice and then it turned on me and I became agitated.. My mom wanted me to help her at work and I wanted to bring chamomile tea bags to make tea there and she said no.. She was watching 90 Day Fiance and said we would leave in 5 minutes. So I went to boil the kettle and put the tea into a coffee flask and I didn't want to explain that to her. I had to wash the flask because it was dirty but she usually yells at me when I turn on the sink.. But she was watching that stupid show.. So all the rage came over me because I didn't want to explain this to her. I took a benzo before I made the tea.. Then I walked to her work. I couldn't pay attention to what she was saying at work and was anxious because I might work there again and can't even pay attention to the smallest things.. Probably because it was cold and causing dissociation.. So I walked back and felt derealization.. It went away eventually and was very mild. Now I'm just going to listen to m
usic and read meaningful lyrics and then watch a movie with my dad while my mom goes to bed. ****. I hate my mom working but I could never do it instead because I'm incapable. She's not laid off and would make more money if she was but no one can do her job because she's too good at multitasking.

174335780,"Took me a few days but I read it. Here is the portion on schizophrenia. Developing Gene-Targeted Therapies of Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Disorders Although scientists have begun to tackle complex polygenic disorderswith gene therapy, they have not yet begun to apply this therapeutic approach to psychiatric disorders, said _NAME_. He asserted that the time has come to think about this challenge while recognizing that clinical applications are a long way off. Although neuropsychiatric disorders are highly heritable, all common neuropsychiatric disorders are highly polygenic, with phenotypes resulting from myriad small genetic nudges rather than a large genetic shove, said _NAME_. He noted that this complicates efforts to identify which genes could be targeted. Moreover, he said, highly penetrant alleles that substantially elevate risk for early-onset behavioral disorders are quickly selected out of the gene pool because these highly disabling illnesses reduce the likelihood that an affected p
erson will have children (Power _PERSON_, 2013). Large-effect alleles can occur de novo, but are rarely transmitted, while common and rare variants with low effect sizes can be readily transmitted, said _NAME_. Nonetheless, scientists have created animal models that replicate the human phenotype and have been able to reverse the phenotype by targeting specific genes, suggesting that gene therapy may be feasible. For example, _NAME_ cited the work of _NAME_ Bird and colleagues, who were able to reverse neurological defects in a mouse model of _PERSON_ syndrome (Guy _PERSON_, 2007). Schizophrenia, however, is far more complex, said _NAME_, with hundreds of genome-wide significant loci identified and extreme phenotypic heterogeneity (_PERSON_, 2019). He described a tool that could help scientists roughly stratify affected individuals at a genetic level by creating, for each individual, a weighted sum of risk alleles across the entire genome to produce a polygenic risk score (PRS). The PRS enables stratification 
of subjects by severity of genetic loading and permits identification of shared common variant risk across phenotypes, said _NAME_. It can also help identify important genetic pathways and potentially identify targets for gene therapy interventions, he said. For example, about 70 percent of genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits in AD studies are expressed in microglia and are thought to be involved in inappropriate synapse elimination, said _NAME_. He speculated that in schizophrenia, although none of the GWAS hits are expressed in microglia, there may be similar biological processes reached through different pathways such as genes encoding synaptic proteins and complement proteins that signal to microglia, adding that useful target selection can sometimes emerge from analysis of these pathways. What is important, he said, is to understand the biology. Transgenic animal models would require vastly improved methods of multiplexing using gene editing technologies."

175931372,"I am a religion experiencing itself. People are obsessed with certain things, everything. What do I do? - One says. Anything. Police go inside a building and the thieves go to the second floor, then the police go to the second floor while the thieves go to the third floor and so on until the top floor. In relation to smoking toad venom which is the most ego dissolving psychedelic, the ego is gone which is who you are, your personality, memories, everything. That is God. That's why they call 5-meo-dmt ""The God molecule"". Because it's the same as getting to the highest floor. And people come back saying that they were everything, nothing, then everything again. Psychosis is like a struggle between this manifestation of mind. People are always putting each other down because someone is right, but delusional and wrong. Together is to better humanity. But there's evils. The devil, demons and all the bad things. But good is bad and bad is good. The paradox. There will always be higher and richer people 
making the world a living hell for the poor. Destruction will happen in trying to make it perfect because there's such a variety of people. So the best thing to do is not think about it and live life. People will want more money when they already have too much. To create people with better genetics and make everyone intelligent and healthy means people will be the same and more people will live. People need to die or there's overpopulation.

174335798,"First off, I am not diagnosed with schizophrenia or any other psychotic disorder. This is some back story, you don't have to read it, just skip forward to the ****** I am now 18, have had severe mental health issues in the past with depression and anxiety since I was 14. Have been in and out of the hospital(psych wards) for the past 4 years. Last year, in 2018, during a 4 month involuntary admission (I was 17), as a last resort they decided ECT may benefit me. It ended up saving my life and had a significant effect on me. However my period of remission lasted only a month and a half before i fell into a crippling major depression episode. They then decided that I would need maintenance ECT, as in after a course of ECT, i would continue having ECT every 2 weeks. And then have ECT monthly after 4 months. (I now have ECT monthly) And i still feel much better. **************************** Here is the problem now. Lately i've been feeling ""off"". It started off not too bad, just feeling like I don't un
derstand things as well and just my normal daily day to day mental functioning seemed odd. Now I have ""_NAME_"" every single day, multiple times a day. But I KNOW its not _NAME_. I KNOW it has happened before. However, if it's not one of those times where I know for sure it's happened before, I have to seriously think about whether it actually happened or if it was just my imagination. Sometimes it feels like ""visions"" like I get the ""_NAME_"" feeling but because I just know it happened before but things still feel weird so I literally keep telling myself ""excuses"" or I try to rationalize it the best I can like ""oh I probably just forgot"" or when i have ""_NAME_"" episodes like when I watch tv and i know it happened before i tell myself that ""maybe i watched it before and just forgot i did"". Or if I know that I hung out with my friend and went to the same place, did the same things, talked about the same stuff. And i kept telling my friend ""we've been here before, I remember we did this last time"" 
(Like i know 10000000% we have been there before) and my friend kept saying ""we have never been here before what are you talking about"" And I kept telling myself that SHE'S the one who forgot. But when these vision/_NAME_ things started happening, I at first thought I had some psychic ability to predict the future. Because sometimes I SWEAR to god i remember a memory of something happening in the past, but then like next week it happens! The exact memory I had from a week before. Now I don't think i have special powers or anything, like i'm not thinking psychic in some delusional way, I just have a very open mind and I like to think of every possibility. But the amount of times i have to keep asking myself if ""did this really happen, or did i just imagine it? God i'm so stupid"" etc, etc. It's not even a ""feeling"" that ""oh this feels similar"". Like I honestly cannot differentiate between the two. So at this point, I have the following theories about this: - I really do have some psychic power (like for 
real) - I have a brain tumour because I don't know what else it could be - I am losing my sanity Please let me know which one of the 3 theories is more likely! Because I've got no clue"

175931399,"I have no idea how people can go on believing these impossible things. I believed similar things for a couple years when my disease started, but mostly it was because I didn‚Äôt tell anybody about them. When you tell someone about it you instantly realize how crazy what you‚Äôre saying sounds. I should probably be more empathetic to people but I just want to shake them and say ‚Äúnobody is following you!‚Äù There‚Äôs not much else I can do. Unfortunately that method has a low success rate, but hey, it worked for me. I just needed to be shaken by other people enough times. That and the medicine probably worked together to end my delusions. I guess reality checking on my end helped as well. I think a certain amount of recovery over time helps one let go of delusions and paranoia."

e‚Äù is radical monotheistic universalism (I named ‚Äúnative‚Äù religion, faith of my mentality ‚Äúramounism‚Äù after first two letters in words in the phrase ‚Äúradical monotheistic universalism‚Äù) which preaches eternal, endless salvation, happiness and tormentlessness for every conscious being which exists, without any annihilation of conscious being. It is beautiful that there is only one God who creates pan-creation from nothing, ex nihilo. Thanks to it all pan-existence is ""like the one great family, even more closely related due to existence of One and Only Almighty to each other beings than in biological family. My mentality thinks that there is no eternal hell and even temporary purgatory with large sufferings, it just thinks that evil people will wait long time and regret their evils after death, but for some time (maybe even for example million years) they reach total sinlessness and beatific vision, total communion with one Creator and saved persons. Ramounism also ‚Äúteaches‚Äù that all fallen 
angels will eventually be saved and eternally happy. It also teaches that all animals (if they have consciousness and are sentient) after death go straight to heaven where they will live in bliss without end. From Catholic (or mainstream Protestant, Muslim, Jewish) perspective ramounism looks like one thing: wishful thinking . I may have ‚Äú delusions ‚Äù (rather temptations) that ramounism is the divine truth and I should preach it to gain more merits and glory in the afterlife. I suppose that I may have rather persistent delusional disorder (F22 in ICD-10) that schizotypal disorder (F21) or (even more) schizophrenia (F20). I have not hallucinations and in my life they occurred only sporadically and were very short. I have thoughts ‚Äúsimilar to delusions‚Äù (some may think that they are delusions), but their influence on my life appears to be or may be too small to talk about true paranoic disorder , my coincidences and ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù about women having not certain parts of the body, organs and trace eleme
nts rather do not alter the way of my life to inexplicable extent. My coincidences are rather a sort of hobby or ‚Äúspecial interest‚Äù (which may be symptom of _PERSON_‚Äôs syndrome), I like to think about them and it gives me pleasure, ‚Äúbodily‚Äù bizarre ideas rather do not have large influence in my life. OCD symptoms have much larger influence on my overall funcioning than my ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù in my opinion. I admit that my OCD symptoms appear to be truly ‚Äúrational‚Äù and ‚Äúlogical‚Äù - fear of uncleanness of food or animals is associated with doctrines of some monotheistic religions, I do not want to be a heretic, but I fear touching pork, fear of infection is present since about 5 years, it changed my life quite strongly - I do not want to do household chores and jobs (which I earlier did even willingly, with pleasure!), wash myself (paradoxically). My OCD became ‚Äúlike religion‚Äù, so it may be hard to treat by medications. Similar case is with my ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù. My OCD appears to worsen with age 
and paroxetine in quite large dosage (40 mg daily) may do not help at all or help really, relatively small."

I don‚Äôt fluctuate all during the day between the two moods. My medicine keeps me functioning in the middle. When I was first put on Lithium for the mania, I felt like the air had been let out of an overtight balloon. When you first got on medicine for Bipolar II, you said, ‚ÄúI've been like this (depression, irritability, impulsiveness, anxiety) before starting meds and during.‚Äù So, the medicine has not affected your Bipolar 2, leading you to say, ‚ÄúI don't seem to have classic bi polar symptoms but am diagnosed with Bi polar 2.‚Äù Then you ask, ‚ÄúMy questions is, does anyone else here experiencing daily mood shifts like I do. If so is this typical for bi polar particularly bi polar 2. Could this just be my baseline mood?‚Äù I don‚Äôt, and you doctor said that was unusual. And, ‚ÄúThe questions is are we dealing with bi p

In adults, it may be extreme restlessness or wearing others out with constant activity. ‚Ä¢ Impulsivity means a person makes hasty actions that occur in the moment without first thinking about them and that may have a high potential for harm, or a desire for immediate r
ewards or inability to delay gratification. An impulsive person may be socially intrusive and excessively interrupt others or make important decisions without considering the long-term consequences. Bipolar II, webmd.com says, has moods cycling between high and low over time. A person affected by bipolar II disorder has had at least one hypomanic episode in their life. Most people with bipolar II disorder suffer more often from episodes of depression. In between episodes of hypomania and depression, many people with bipolar II disorder typically live normal lives. Symptoms include during a hypomanic episode, elevated mood can manifest itself as either euphoria (feeling ""high"") or as irritability. And, flying suddenly from one idea to the next, having exaggerated self confidence, rapid, ""pressured"" (uninterruptible) and loud speech."

When I was in hospital, the most time I ever spent in front of a psychiatrist was the few weeks I was there, and I got diagnosed. Now I only have 30min consultations with the pdoc over the phone, and that is no way a decent amount of time to mess with someones diagnosis. I found my letter from October 2013, where they finally gave me the SZ label, and I couldn‚Äôt believe how sick I was.

175931523,"I am so sorry that you have so much anxiety. Did you ever try benzo for anxiety? You should talk to your doctor for this issue? You can try 10mg for couple weeks to see if you feel better. If not, you can just drop it down again. If you do the calorie count, weight gain should not be a problem. Have you try other med? Is it the only one that work for you?"

There has go to be more to us than just neurons and serotonin. I believe we keep coming back as different forms of beings until we‚Äôve fulfilled our destiny or learned all we can learn, developed all we can develop.

175931530,Meds helped me get stable but those delusions still seem very real. I guess I learned to move on from them and not buy into that. It‚Äôs hard. It can be about smoke and mirrors and they can be very seductive to some people.

175931540,We aren‚Äôt integrated and have no plans too but I‚Äôm glad it worked out for your mom!! As for her teaching you dissociation I‚Äôm curious to hear more about that? But for your question it‚Äôs possible to have dissociation without DID. Dissociation is actually pretty normal in people but if it happens to frequently or severely it can be classified as a disorder. Dissociation has many different symptoms such as feeling yourself or the world around you isnt real and Lapses in memory/blackouts. Now I personally don‚Äôt know enough about your situation to say one way or the other for if its dissociation or memory issues. But I will say it doesnt sound like DID. Though if you have any questions about how I experience my dissociation I am more than happy to answer!! I hope this answer makes sense

You can imagine my disappointment when i realized i cant run from delusion.

Computer science is for straight programmers, so developing software and a little math thrown in. Math is my personal favorite of the three. It gives you a complete background on the numerical nature of the universe while also being super useful for a logical skill such as programming. I personally would do this with a minor in computer science, theres a lot of overlap so it wouldnt be too much work. Whatever you do, good luck!

175931571,For immediate relief I have found that CBD wont do as much as it will do when its used consistently.

Then it's like it builds up and I spill over with creative energy and start bouncing off the walls. I can burn bridges when in that state, so I try to have an outlet somewhere so it doesn't build up. As for getting sucked into other's energy, often people bore me and I don't feel an enjoyable connection, but I do like to laugh and joke. So if I can get a group of people laughing and willing to joke too, I try to build upon it because it's like I become something else entirely for a little while and I get ""high"" off of it.

A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Dialogues in clinical neuroscience , Sep 2019 Despite effective pharmacological treatments for psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions), functional outcomes for people with psychotic disorders are often disappointing. Although it is not included in the diagnostic criteria for psychotic disorders, cognitive impairment is one of the strongest determinants of community functioning in this clinical population, and thus it is an important target for intervention. In this review, we discuss the major areas of research regarding impaired cognition in psychotic illness. The specific topics covered include: (i) the prevalence of cognitive impairment in psychotic disorders; (ii) the profile and magnitude of cognitive impairment in psychotic disorders; (iii) the developmental course of cognitive impairment; (iv) the longitudinal 
stability of cognitive impairment; and (v) treatment approaches to improve cognitive performance in people with psychotic disorders.?.A pesar de los tratamientos farmacol√≥gicos efectivos para los s√≠ntomas psic√≥ticos (como alucinaciones y delirios), los resultados funcionales para las personas con trastornos psic√≥ticos a menudo son decepcionantes.

175932120,"Hypomania is a very elevated mood, the ‚Äòup‚Äô part of bipolar disorder although it is not just about being very happy. It‚Äôs a less severe form of mania and is part of bipolar type two which is my diagnosis. It is often very disruptive to your life and very distressing This elevated mood can last for varying amounts of time really depending on the person and even on the episode. People experience symptoms of hypomania in different ways; for some people, it may have a very euphoric factor wherein they feel very happy and on top of the world for short time before other symptoms take over more so. For me, it‚Äôs hardly ever a pleasant or euphoric experience, although perhaps more so in my teenage years but now it tends to feel uncomfortable, anxiety-ridden and is followed by a massive crash into guilt from any actions I have taken during the hypomania that were out of character, and soul-crushing depression. I want to state here that whether or not people have the euphoric aspect of hypomania, it i
s still really disruptive to your life and very difficult to deal with, and is certainly not to be romanticized or looked upon as fun.

Keeping my head above water On a day to day basis when I‚Äôm stable or close to stable, I feel as though I‚Äôm swimming along through water with one manageable weight on my back which is my bipolar disorder. It‚Äôs hard to keep swimming but I can manage, I keep my head above the water although sometimes it‚Äôs higher than other times, sometimes my chin touches the water, sometimes the waves are choppier, but in general I keep moving forward and I‚Äôm coping. Occasionally there are islands along the way and I get to stop for a rest, and there are some really beautiful things on the island; I experience true happiness at these times and I am able to fully relax, then I start swimming again.

r When my mood is sinking lower and I am struggling to stay afloat, it feels as though more weights are being added to my back as I swim. I try to keep going but it gets harder and harder to keep my head up and to keep moving forward towards the next island.

Other times, more and more weights keep being added and before long I‚Äôm just treading water, not moving forward, stuck in one place just trying not to drown. By the time it gets to this point I am very unlikely to be able to remove the weights and to get moving again; I start to feel at a loss and helpless, worried about slipping under the water into full depression and feeling worthless because I haven‚Äôt been able to keep swimming even though I‚Äôve tried really hard. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-journey/2019/08/trying-not-to-drown-how-fighting-off-depression-feels/"

175932187,"GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News ‚Äì 9 Apr 21 Scientists Develop CRISPRoff for Controlling Gene Expression through... Reversible CRISPR method controls gene expression while leaving underlying DNA sequence unchanged. Est. reading time: 7 minutes This seems like it will be pretty damn important in the future. Scientists led by a team at the Whitehead Institute have developed a new gene editing technology, called CRISPRoff, which can be used to control gene expression with high specificity, while leaving the sequence of the DNA unchanged. the method is also fully reversible. (There‚Äôs a CRISPRon too.) ‚ÄúThe big story here is we now have a simple tool that can silence the vast majority of genes,‚Äù said _PERSON_, who is also a professor of biology at MIT and an investigator with the _NAME_ Medical Institute. ‚ÄúWe can do this for multiple genes at the same time without any DNA damage, with great deal of homogeneity, and in a way that can be reversed. It‚Äôs a great tool for controlli
ng gene expression.‚Äù ‚ÄúAn alternative modality for modulating gene function is to rewrite the epigenetic landscape to control gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence,‚Äù they wrote. This epigenetic strategy is designed to silence or activate genes based on chemical changes to the DNA strand. To build an epigenetic editor that could mimic natural DNA methylation, the researchers created a tiny protein machine that, guided by small RNAs, can tack methyl groups onto specific spots on the strand. These methylated genes are then silenced, or turned off, hence the name CRISPRoff. Because the method does not alter the sequence of the DNA strand, the researchers can reverse the silencing effect through the use of enzymes that remove the methyl groups, a method that they called CRISPRon. As they tested CRISPRoff in different conditions, the researchers discovered that they could target the method to the vast majority of genes in the human genome, and that also it worked not just for the genes t
hemselves, but for other regions of DNA that control gene expression but do not code for proteins. ‚ÄúOur initial experiments demonstrate CRISPRoff can perturb enhancers, opening the potential to target genome elements that control tissue-specific gene expression.‚Äù First author _PERSON_ acknowledged, ‚ÄúThat was a huge shock even for us, because we thought it was only going to be applicable for a subset of genes.‚Äù It just keeps sounding better and better. And while delivery to specific tissues remains a challenge for gene editing technologies such as CRISPRoff, as _PERSON_ noted, ‚Äúwe showed that you can deliver it transiently as a DNA or as an RNA, the same technology that‚Äôs the basis of the Moderna and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.‚Äù"

Have you tried therapy....not so much to deal with the psychosis but how you think about yourself? Like for me I had therapy right after that episode and they made me feel like a normal human again. I had thought I was terrible but they said it was actually and indication of how good I was that I wanted to stop the devil etc. obviously my mind was confused but that‚Äôs not my fault anymore than it‚Äôs yours, psychosis is a living nightmare even at its best, but the best is still better than the worst. Supposedly psychosis is a bit like drug use where the setting has influences so if you go in with a positive attitude like you‚Äôre chosen to be a healer like in other countries where they believe this is how shamans are chosen then you‚Äôre going to have a better time. I believe it because most of my delusions had to do with being a shaman and I 
say the experience was decent like 80% of the time. It was when I veered Into the western way of thinking...good vs evil where the badness began. I just wonder if you‚Äôre religious or not? For me I was an atheist before the psychosis. If you‚Äôre not particularly religious maybe exploring other religions without a dichotomy would be beneficial.

Then a few moments later when the train is leaving i will say ‚Äòyou are an inferior human‚Äô. Then i will walk away and go to another station The way this worm goes on is pathetic thinking they rule the place and public toilets which at many stations are constantly open they have no say. I heard them say once as well in front of me that the city was a city of dregs and the dirty looks are unbelievable but i will go out looking for them. I did say something to them on that other occasion but it was not as pointed I have done a similar thing once with a bus driver wher

When you re-order checks, you may want to get the style of checks that have a carbon copy paper for each check.

I can‚Äôt explain my symptoms ‚Äì I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening to me, at all. Other people have magic powers that I don‚Äôt have. It took me a long time to slowly get with the program on a daily routine, and now that I‚Äôm focusing on routine, I‚Äôm finding 4 out of 7 days a week is approximately the best I can do. I have deep negative symptoms in addition to the positive ones, both of which slow me down a lot. Believe me, I want to be working and integrated into society, like the normal person I once was as recently as some years ago. I want that more than a
nything. At this point, I‚Äôm lucky if I get one poem written a day, so I focus on that. When I can, I add chores and other positive activities in addition to the writing. It is an enormous struggle to take care of my basic needs to this day. Which screws up everything for me. What I hope to get out of this forum is friendship, support, and other peoples‚Äô perspective on sz. I have with interest and no small amount of horror been reading about others‚Äô delusions on this forum. Many of them are familiar to me. I suffer from the same ones. I‚Äôm paranoid about everyone and everything. I may have accused some posters of being here to troll me, when in fact they were just telling their truth and it scared me. I need this support group. Like many, I‚Äôve been effectively homebound for a long time. That is not new to me with the pandemic. But I need help. I fantasize about suicide every day. I want this hell to end. Maybe someday I would trust you all enough to be more vulnerable about the specifics. I would like 
that. Unfortunately my trust ‚Äì which I naively give too easily ‚Äì has already been violated once here. I hope to have a better, more respected status in the future. The lies about me that you may have heard are just that. I am not a bad person. I am person who loves easily and does their best to help others in many ways. My IRL friends know this. I hope you come to know this about me here. Thank you."

My understanding of it, and perhaps it‚Äôs just because I got in at a really lovely research clinic that abides by this philosophy, is that it really is a spectrum much like autism. Some people are high-functioning & do well in the world, whilst others are very much debilitated.

175932401,"Trigger warning: this story discusses emotional abuse To me, kind and lasting love feels like a _NAME_ set; with everything merging into a calm and gentle background _NAME_. Toxic love feels like living at a Slipknot concert (nothing against Slipknot) with booming noisy chaos and masks that blind you from the reality of the relationship. I have experienced covert emotional abuse: its power and control, and the damaging impact that had on my mental health. I want to share my story to raise awareness of the serious nature of this type of abuse, the impact it has on mental health and to help other victims feel like they are not alone. What a toxic relationship and emotional abuse felt like Barrage of love It all started with love bombing, mirroring and flattery, leaving no space for me to see chaos and red flags. The relationship was possessive and obsessive, filled with poetic language, movie-esque intoxicating love and grand gestures. It was intense and short lived. 900√ó500 114 KB Subtle shifts It 
involved subtle shifts through inconsistent communication, the giving and taking away of their availability and affection. Danger was implicit and always there. I was to be made aware of a sense of fragility in the relationship, the growing cracks that I needed to tread delicately on due to the risk of it ending if I didn‚Äôt stay in line. The unravelling Everything started to reverse, at a fast pace. The unpicking of the love and flattery they gave at the beginning was deeply unsettling and confusing, and took with it my self-esteem‚Ä¶ and at this point I was weak and so under their control that I was living off the illusion that was created at the start. Nothing left of me It was a black hole that sucked me in, soaked up my goodness and spat me out when there was no longer any use in me. It felt dark, toxic and damaging ‚Äì because it was. At the end I was vulnerable and my mental health had spiralled. My family and friends were left confused as to where the bubbly and happy person they knew had gone, and h
ow this had happened in such a short amount of time. This is because I‚Äôd just had one of the most confusing experiences involving emotional manipulation, gaslighting and abuse such as: telling lies or exaggerating denying they said things that you both know they did their actions not matching their words putting you down and then praising you eliciting insecurity and anxiety when you bring up their conflicting actions convincing you it is your mental health causing confusion after directly causing it with their actions it all culminating in a co-dependent relationship caused by the fear and vulnerability that the abuser created. 900√ó500 121 KB What emotional abuse and a toxic relationship taught me There is a tendency to self-blame - it is not your fault It is okay to keep yourself safe and allow time to heal? 900√ó500 208 KB "" The result was I became a wallflower A forgotten, colourless wallflower, A wallflower that was taught to allow anything from the one they love, to feel a small amount of energy in 
return A wallflower that gave the sun to someone else, after they said that they should be the entire energy source The issue was, I was the sun all along And now, with kind love, I feel compassionate and powerful again I feel able to say I want to shift myself from the ones that offer toxic energy I feel like I have the strength to wake up in the morning and work on being my own sun I feel like I have the strength to curl up at night, and protect, watching the weary petals fall away to the earth Letting the winter heal"" Journal entry, after the end of the toxic relationship Toxic love and abuse is NOISY It is fast moving, unsafe, cruel, destabilising, and selfish with no boundaries. It‚Äôs a broken promise and pushing of personal boundaries followed by grand, big gestures to fix it ‚Ä¶ on repeat. Healthy love is quiet It is so still that you almost forget it‚Äôs there. It is constant, safe, kind, grounding and selfless with healthy boundaries. It‚Äôs a cup of tea on your bedside table each morning. It is my 
mum feeding the birds and changing their water every day, even when the bird bath freezes over and she still manages to come back inside with a smile on her face. Signs of a toxic relationship You don‚Äôt feel good enough. You constantly seek the other person‚Äôs validation. You feel you have to walk on eggshells and monitor everything you say and do. You‚Äôre afraid to bring things up because you‚Äôre not sure how the other person will react. The other person puts you down. The other person doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for their actions and instead blames you. You start to withdraw from participating in activities or seeing people in your life. Signs of a healthy relationship Both people treat each other with respect. There is trust and the relationship is nurturing. Both people listen to each other and there is compromise. Both people are honest and can hear feedback without it leading to physical, verbal or emotional abuse (for example, the ‚Äòsilent treatment‚Äô or ignoring). Both people can be responsib
le for their own needs and also care for the relationship. Both people feel supported to do things they like. Both people are able to exert boundaries in the relationship. Find out more about investing in healthy relationships with our guide Read _PERSON_‚Äôs story of life after sexual violence _NAME_, Chief Executive of Women‚Äôs Aid: ‚ÄúDoes he manipulate you by making you feel sorry for him? Does he blame you for everything that goes wrong? These behaviours can slowly erode your confidence and independence, and have a devastating impact on your mental health. They are possessive, controlling and ultimately abusive. ‚ÄúThese are some of the signs of emotional abuse that form part of a repeated pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour. This sometimes subtle form of abuse was made illegal two years ago, yet much more awareness needs to be raised to make sure that everyone understands it and can recognise it. Lack of understanding is one reason why women and their family and friends don‚Äôt always recogni
se abuse straight away, or realise what is happening until it has got extremely serious. It can have a devastating impact on women, including causing or exacerbating mental health issues. We know from our work with survivors that nearly a quarter of women accessing community-based support services had mental health support needs, while this increases to nearly a third of women who are living in refuge (Women‚Äôs Aid 2016 Annual Survey). ‚ÄúThis simply has to change. Coercive control is at the heart of abusive relationships, and that‚Äôs why at Women‚Äôs Aid we work hard to raise awareness of all forms of abuse and offer expert support to those who are experiencing it and their friends and family.""

175932444,Uhhh a few days is a bit crazy unless you‚Äôre getting a shot. That‚Äôs not long enough for pills to even get to a steady state in your bloodstream. I would say earliest is like 3 weeks. If a med helped me at all I started to see some positive effects at least at that point. It can take longer to fully work but you should at least see some benefit by around 3 weeks. Probably takes like 2 months to really fully kick in and keep you stable if it works. That‚Äôs been my experience and I‚Äôve been on a _NAME_ meds.

174336024,If your doctor is good they‚Äôll take onboard what you‚Äôve gone through. It really is a bit of an art no matter what they say. A good psydoc will have an idea and I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs good to listen to their advice‚Ä¶still better to be up to date and have a plan yourself. It‚Äôs a hard thing concentrating. That can be the meds or the disorder‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a bit of a grey area because we just don‚Äôt know. Saying that. I did poorly on risperdal and do so much better on zyprexa.

175932472,Thats cool When you‚Äôve been high or drunk every days for years you have to relearn how to live without substances. Alcohol was never my vice. I can drink without it being a problem. I only drink a couple times a year. When I quit doing drugs I felt completely lost in life. Getting high consumed my every waking moment from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep.

174336032,"I worked summers ages 13-15, , then age 16-20 I worked all years full time while in high school full time graduating a month before turning 18. My senior year ended in Jan 2003 and I turned 18 Feb 2003. I moved out the day I graduated, but never got to walk because _PERSON_‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt give me a 6 month in advance request off of June 13-15 for my wedding the 13th, high school grad walk on the 14th, and family get together on the 14th as a few people for a wedding reception/graduation party. I worked until bedrest was required for both pregnancies I worked. I took a 6 week maternity leave with first, second I went back after 10 days birth which included going out to SD when 2nd kid was 7 days old and grabbing younger sisters from SD to help watch kids, then taking sisters and both kids back to SD to drop sisters off for school and my grandparents took my 3 month old for a month and my mom and stepdad and sisters took oldest who was 20 months old for that month so we could convert me to 3rd shift 
at the hospital and go through and finalize bankruptcy. We got the kids after that month, then I got fired Dec 2005 when baby was 6 months old for Post partum psychosis and going into a psych ward the hospital I worked for owned and was part of. So after I was out we decided to go for a daughter, not sure when she came about because her conception date was a month after our last time together but we got her and then August 2006 we left everything that wasn‚Äôt for the kids or our clothes and put that in a little hitch pull uhaul trailer and moved out to SD. Daughter was born Dec 2006, 17 days early, but over 8 pounds, so her timings were way off, but either she was a giant preemie or she was more overdue and that‚Äôs part of my hemorrhage (add in the student doctor that shredded the placenta with his hand cause he had no idea what the hell he was doing, I was first birth and the OBGYN just stood across the room and watched, no help.) We had a house bought in that 2004-2006 time, got hosed by a realtor that sa
id we were approved for a 76k house, well I saw it in summer, so I didn‚Äôt test power, and since we knew nothing about buying a house their own inspector said it was ok. We moved in Nov 2004‚Ä¶no heat or power in the entire upstairs. We lived on extension cords and space heater. As long as my kid(s) would have power and heat in their room, us parents dealt. In the summer once that came around the kids bed and crib were put into living room where the only window AC was. Good thing, we were in gang territory. Now this mortgages was given to us with me making 7.25 an hour as a mcd‚Äôs manager, and _NAME_ making 12.50 an hour in the pharmacy IT office. No way should we have done been able to get a loan like that, oh, and 0 down. Remember 19 and 21 year old couple a under 1 year old, another on the way, and we were prime targets for those companies that most recognize as causing the 2008 housing bubble burst. But we bought this house in now, 37k for it cause it‚Äôs old, but we qualified based only on his income o
n a job he was gonna have once we got here. That was based on 19 an hour, my 825 a month SSDI wasn‚Äôt counted towards income because it made the process easier. We did it right this time though, put 5k down cause I had Grama‚Äôs life insurance payout. But when we got out here we qualified for food stamps, medicaid, and the weatherization program. They completely put insulation into the whole house, which we had none being an 1882 house, they gave us a brand new water heater and installed, and went thru and did something and updated thermostat. We don‚Äôt have central air, but the program was a big helper. They also replaced 2 doors that weren‚Äôt energy saver so that was cool too. And got a brand new energy saver fridge from them. Total grant was about 18,000 I do believe. We get no help now as _NAME_‚Äôs job is 22 an hour plus benefits, and I do have Medicare with my SSDI. So this year with _NAME_‚Äôs raise no school lunch price reduction, but we‚Äôve got it figured how the kids can pack a bigger lunch than 
the 4.85 the district charges for lunches. 3 kids in school, almost 15 bucks a day, nope, we‚Äôre adding 50 bucks a week to grocery budget and they‚Äôll make their own. We never got Section 8 early on, or any help except for WIC and Medicaid for the kids and prenatal, birth, and the 6 week check post partum. Second kid I had insurance thru hospital we both worked for, but I got hired at 5 months pregnant, they got to consider it preexisting condition, back in 2005 still legal, and _PERSON_‚Äôs birth cost me 150,000 even though I had no interventions, no epidural, no transfusions, they just decided to keep saying he was deaf and the hospital I gave birth in most women did not go home with their kids cause they tested positive for meth or crack. I was kept 4 days being told _PERSON_ was failing the audio tests, kid had nothing wrong, they were doing blood tests hourly to see if their negative for drugs was really true. That bill is the final reason we did bankruptcy. Sz wasn‚Äôt something they even knew I had, 
so they would‚Äôve used that if they knew."

174336058,"Deficits in social functioning are especially severe amongst schizophrenia individuals with the prevalent comorbidity of social anxiety disorder (SZ&SAD). Yet, the mechanisms underlying the recognition of facial expression of emotions‚Äîa hallmark of social cognition‚Äîare practically unexplored in SZ&SAD. Here, we aim to reveal the visual representations SZ&SAD ( n = 16) and controls ( n = 14) rely on for facial expression recognition. We ran a total of 30,000 trials of a facial expression categorization task with Bubbles, a data-driven technique. Results showed that SZ&SAD‚Äôs ability to categorize facial expression was impared compared to controls. More severe negative symptoms (flat affect, apathy, reduced social drive) was associated with more impaired emotion recognition ability, and with more biases in attributing neutral affect to faces. Higher social anxiety symptoms, on the other hand, was found to enhance the reaction speed to neutral and angry faces. Most importantly, Bubbles showed tha
t these abnormalities could be explained by inefficient visual representations of emotions: compared to controls, SZ&SAD subjects relied less on fine facial cues (high spatial frequencies) and more on coarse facial cues (low spatial frequencies). SZ&SAD participants also never relied on the eye regions (only on the mouth) to categorize facial expressions. We discuss how possible interactions between early (low sensitivity to coarse information) and late stages of the visual system (overreliance on these coarse features) might disrupt SZ&SAD‚Äôs recognition of facial expressions. Our findings offer perceptual mechanisms through which comorbid SZ&SAD impairs crucial aspects of social cognition, as well as functional psychopathology. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-020-00116-1"

175932644,"Side Effects & Safety A powdered preparation of cowhage seed, called Zandopa (formerly HP-200; Zandu Pharmaceuticals), is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth for up to 20 weeks. The most common side effects include nausea and a sensation of abdominal bloating. Less common side effects include vomiting, abnormal body movements, and insomnia. ADVERTISEMENT Rare but possible side effects of other cowhage preparations include headache, pounding heartbeat, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and delusions. The hair of the cowhage bean pod is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth or applied directly to the skin. It is a strong irritant and can cause severe itching, burning, and swelling. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking cowhage if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) : Due to the levodopa (L-dop
a) in cowhage, it should be avoided or used cautiously in people with cardiovascular disease. L-dopa can frequently cause low blood pressure on standing (orthostatic hypotension), dizziness, and fainting. Much less frequently, L-dopa can also cause pounding or irregular heartbeat. Diabetes : There is some evidence that cowhage can lower blood sugar levels and might cause blood sugar to drop too low. If you have diabetes and use cowhage, be sure to monitor you blood sugar carefully. The doses of your diabetes medications might need to be adjusted. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) : There is some evidence that cowhage can lower blood sugar levels and might make low blood sugar worse. Liver disease : Cowhage contains levodopa (L-dopa). L-dopa seems to raise the blood levels of chemicals that indicate liver damage. This may mean that the cowhage is making liver disease worse. If you have liver disease, don‚Äôt use cowhage. Skin cancer called melanoma : The body can use the levodopa (L-dopa) in cowhage to make to th
e skin pigment called melanin. There is some concern that this extra melanin might make melanoma worse. Don‚Äôt use cowhage if you have a history of melanoma or a suspicious changes in the skin. Stomach or intestinal ulcers (peptic ulcer disease) : There have been reports that levodopa (L-dopa) can cause gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in people with ulcers. Since cowhage contains L-dopa, there is some concern that it might cause gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients with ulcers. However, this problem has not yet been reported with cowhage. Mental illness : Due to the levodopa (L-dopa) content, cowhage might make mental illness disease worse. Surgery : Since cowhage might affect blood sugar levels, there is some concern that it might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking cowhage at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery."

175932764,"I used to believe that every form of life competed with or preyed on every other form of life, but after watching a few nature shows I realized that a lot of life forms help each other out. For example, the yellow pine puts out pine cones that have these nuts in them. Just at the right time of year a bird comes and starts to cache individual pine nuts in lots of locations. A single bird can stash hundreds of nuts. Then, when the bird needs the nuts in winter time, it can only remember where about seventy percent of the nuts it stashed are. So a lot of yellow pine trees get planted this way. I watched this film about penguins at the south pole. These birds have a lot of selfless behaviors. If human beings had the values these penguins have, communism would work. Also, this is kind of bloody, but artic foxes follow polar bears around during winter and eat all the scraps the bear leaves behind. There is a lot about this world that is incomprehensible to me. There are a lot of examples of cooperation b
etween species, but there is also a lot of savagery. It‚Äôs the way much of nature works. Humanity didn‚Äôt create this scheme. People are evolved from animals, but I think it is our job to transcend the savagery of nature. I was watching this program about the South Sea. It is mostly ocean, but there are a few tiny islands here and there. It is interesting to see how different societies evolved to survive their situations. A few of them didn‚Äôt do well. The stone statues that everyone marvels at on Easter Island were the one single accomplishment of the indigenous society that lived there. This society stripped the island clean of all its resources. At one time Easter Island was teeming with all kinds of life, both plant and animal. Now the island is populated by nothing but barren grass. There is this other small island, and it is so densely populated by human beings that it is the most densely populated piece of earth in the world. These people have used their resources carefully, and they have existed in 
this tiny island for hundreds of years. There was this other island where the people have tamed the eels that populate its shores. They did this because the eels eat all the fetid material around the island and keep the water around them clean. They tamed the eels by offering them scraps of food, and these eels would come up on this slick mud on the island, and they would even let the islanders handle them. The eels were thoroughly tame. The point of this is that humanity has the capability to choose how it lives. We can live according to compassion and wisdom, or we can rape our planet of its resources. We have to decide."

If you‚Äôre having a lot of negative thoughts throughout the day maybe these are manifesting in the dream? I seem to remember having nightmares when I wasn‚Äôt on the right medication as well.

I made a huge effort to stay sane last year and lasted six months, a record. I have been very susceptible to political and societal changes in the past, and in my madness I have thought that I am responsible for them. _PERSON_ and the general election upset my mental state last year, and COVID upset it at the beginning of this year. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs on the agenda for the coming year. I won‚Äôt be able to apply for the masters until next year and I will have to stay sane all that time. The good thing is this gives me time to prepare for the course. If I can learn the material in my own time beforehand, then it won‚Äôt matter so much if I relapse. There are four hundred pages in the core text.

174336097,"In order to make your speech realistic, reasonable and understood about sz; You should distinguish between; The sayings,thoughts,expressive feelings and all types of behavior responses of the individual AND the SZ itself as an independent health condition that has been arisen from absolute nothing and embodied and settled down in the inner conscious state of a human being in the early twenties of age Why this distinguishing ? this in order to determine the casual relationship between the diagnostic material details and the existential effect+ functional effect of the new condition (SZ) . Because,all symptoms arise as a result of the effectiveness of the sz pathogen on the higher mental processes / emotion theater which they precede the production of all personal behavioral responses In the case,if you ignore what we say, the sz condition will be just a group of symptoms , a group meeting of a symptoms causing a disease condition called schizophrenia (The disease itself is the symptom OR the symptom 
itself is the disease) The symptoms cannot create their causes or precede them ontologically In the other side, it is understood that,the symptoms ( Any) are the expressions of the disease and the disease is the pathogen ( the pathogen represents the substance of the disease) We can not rationalize that the Symptoms is the disease is the pathogen !! because,if we ask you simple question: what is the causes of schizophrenia symptoms ? you will going to search about these causes (pathogen) !!"

If you‚Äôre doing laps around your living space and literally can‚Äôt sit still, that‚Äôs probably what it is. It‚Äôs important to keep an eye on it. Last time I was in a mental hospital years ago they injected me with something that gave it to me really bad and other patients were yelling at me for walking in circles.

175932906,"i am at a crossroads when it comes to my weight. i don‚Äôt know if i want to stay the same size or put on muscle. on the one hand, being smaller has it‚Äôs advantages like not needing as much food each day and saving money on groceries. on the other hand, it would really serve me to put on some strength and muscle for work purposes, and to have a more asthetic physique. anyways now that im on meds, i can put on weight easy if i want to. 2000 to 2300 calories a day and i will go back up to 160 pounds or so. right now im about 147 pounds. i remember when i was in my early 20‚Äôs i got back into weight lifting and trying to bulk up and i ate so much. all day i was fueling myself with protein packed meals and was eating 3200 calories. i only got up to 155 pounds but added a lot of strength. that was one of the things that turned me off from amateur bodybuilding is i felt like i would be glutton trying to add weight. plus think of all the time spent in the bathroom. but with these meds i can still eat m
odestly and put on weight. if i do put on weight, im thinking a good weight for me would be anywhere from 155 pounds to 175 pounds. i want to build, big strong legs and lower half, but on my upper body, just add a little size. im pretty content with my upper body as it is. that‚Äôs the thing with alot of young lifters, is they emphasize their beach muscles with the upper body and neglect their legs. i kind of want to be the opposite. so i don‚Äôt know what my weight would be if i build my legs up. i wouldn‚Äôt appear that big i don‚Äôt think. so anyways that is what im thinking about right now. when i start working i may spend more money on food and spend my free time working out, but at the moment im content to be small."

It doesn‚Äôt even matter if I had a good day just the day before, everything still looks bad. But on my bad days, I just keep putting one foot in front of the other and take care of business and eventually good times roll around again and I appreciate having my apartment and a car and all those little moments each day that are good. I‚Äôm sorry so many bad things are piling up right now for you. I know how discouraging that can be. But take one problem at a time and work on it. I find I have to compartmentalize in my head. I have lots of problems too and I know that if I look at everything bad in my life it can look overwhelming sometimes too. I have to block some stuff out and deal 
with it another time. My advice is to try not to give up on people, Don‚Äôt write everybody off just because of a few bad eggs. When I look back on my life, I see that a lot of my happiest times were with people. I can do stuff alone and be happy or content, but I had some of my best times when I had friends or especially when I‚Äôm with my family. It‚Äôs too easy on a bad day to just give up on people. They have their faults but we need people. When I got into AA some alcoholics would talk about how they just wanted to be left alone to drink or do their drugs and forget everybody else. But when alcoholism or drug addiction eventually beat us down or broke us and made us come desperately looking for help, we realize that we need people. We need to depend on other people, we need other people to survive. We need the nourishment of socializing, just like we need healthy food for our body to survive."

175932981,"Psych ward sucks and is boring, I would only go there if its an emergency."
175932982,I feel like I'm in a bit of a crisis. I have texted two of my support group members. I just saw Pdoc last night (telehealth) and basically got him to believe I'm doing okay generally which I think I am but this crisis is just popping up. I'm having a ton of transference towards a coworker which is making life miserable because of you know stupid boundaries. I'm having lots of hallucinations in the early mornings which is a new thing and very disquieting. And I'm having tons of urges to do something desperate to myself. Sigh. Life is hard.
175932983,"Hey, thanks for the responses‚Ä¶ I know it is unhealthy. Since being on AP i ate loads. Now i just forget or i am ‚Äúmeh, dont feel like eating‚Äù. Im more active than normal, yesterday i spent all the morning and evening on highly physical work in my house and afternoon at work. Still - no hunger. So weird. I thought about your comments‚Ä¶it might indeed have to do with all the sad/stressful events these days _AT_MENTION_ . Im not depressed, but im sad. I was thinking about the meds comments too. It might be the opposite. I use a bit less meds since a few months. Last weeks i get more feelings, libido, energy. If more AP caused more hunger, can less AP cause a counterreaction of no hunger?"
175932984,I‚Äôve met several bipolar people and they are as unstable or even more unstable that SZs. There was one bipolar girl at university that kept on repeating first year of uni while I was on my 3 rd year. People think bipolar not as ‚Äúmanic depression‚Äù but who has mild mood swings.
175932985,That‚Äôs not good. Do you take pain meds? That can do that to your testosterone. Did your dr find the cause? I‚Äôd want to treat the cause and take testosterone if I were you
175932986,"Yeah I have taken some now but I always forget I have it and have to be reminded. Just seems like once I get over one thing, something else happens and it feels never ending"
175932987,"Yea I hope I am. I think I did feel discouraged from what you said to the point of like confused rambling. Trying to piece together what I need to actually do. It‚Äôs not your fault by any means. This always happens to me when I talk to everyone. It‚Äôs a whole process with me. And I still value people‚Äôs opinions very much. I do feel like I‚Äôm going in the right direction, so idk why I feel so down about it. And thank you. I took an ativan."
175932988,It sounds good. Have a nice day.
174336139,My Drs refused to do an MRI because I am suicidal. If I see brain damage from schizophrenia I will kill myself.

175932990,"It‚Äôs awesome you want to thank your mom, _AT_MENTION_. Like others have said, maybe a handwritten card would be nice. Or if you‚Äôre able, negatives withstanding, you could make your family dinner sometime."
174336158,"My doctor said that the diminished cognitive effects are both because of the medications and the condition. Is this true? Secondly, which medications are least likely to cause cognitive dysfunction? My Schizoaffective went undiagnosed for 25 years. Therefore, my cognitive abilities have suffered by a degree or more. I am in my quest to revive it in order to reach my potential. Does anyone know of any ways to revive the brain?"
175932991,"That‚Äôs well done _AT_MENTION_ , I‚Äôm happy to hear that for you"
175932992,Just wondering as I‚Äôm thinking of maybe coming off soon due to the side affects

175933000,"In my relationship - we have been together 20 years, broke up and got back together a lot cause we didn‚Äôt know what each other wanted but finally we are the best of friends together married and we don‚Äôt fight anymore. Don‚Äôt give up - relationships are hard, complex, causes insecuriities, and you both learn from them. I used to be really insecure in my own delusions, before diagnosed and treated. I‚Äôm still a little insecure. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, just my own experience. Everyone‚Äôs gonna have different ones. But my suggestion, its when you find someone you can live with and be yourself with. Anyone who can‚Äôt accept or understand you is just not right for you."
174336146,Clozapine is the only med that has worked for me.
175933001,I tried Valerian root as well didn‚Äôt do anything for me.
174336152,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cool to have schizophrenia. I‚Äôd rather I never had any experience of mental illness at all. Mind you I remember that quote I read on someone who had schizophrenia‚Äôs profile saying ‚Äúsanity was a nasty disease‚Äù and I tend to agree. There‚Äôs no shame in having suffered from mental illness and once the condition dies down there is a lot you can do to make your life better. I do agree with the OP though there are lots of people who pretend to be suffering from schizophrenia to look cool.
175933002,"I don‚Äôt think that talking like that helps. You may deny that meds help, but it seems the evidence is against you. It‚Äôs irresponsible to tell people to quit meds. Doctors make that decision, not strangers on the internet"
175933003,"Family knows, my closest friends know. A couple of people at work know, but nobody ever said anything about it really and people seem to act completely normal around me. But I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone unless I was comfortable with it, because it‚Äôs nobodys business really."

175933007,"Hospitals in India can be really bad. And the care homes are even worse. The care home I was put in for 4 months when I had a bad psychosis had no running water for first 2 months, squat toilets without lockable doors and staff who didnt speak English."
175933008,I think I tried Prozac once. That‚Äôs an SSRI I believe. Antidepressant I think. It made me psychotic. I only took one and threw the rest away. I take Wellbutrin. It works much better. I take it in the morning. They make an extended release tab in 300 mg. I used to take two 150 mg twice a day but that was a pain. The one in the morning is much better. I think the maximum dose is 450.
174336147,im from syria but i live in australia
175933009,"This really seems like something you both should have a heart to heart about. If you have a therapist or pdoc, bring it up with them. You both obviously care about each other, so it worth a try before making a change as big as moving out. If you were to move out, do you have an idea of what that might look like? For example, will you live alone or with roommates? And are you able to afford the basics like rent, utilities and food?"

If the dopamine is the substance of hallucination (psychosis or else ) ,you must prove this mouthful assumption in the case of sleep and wakefulness instead to talking about the medication program of antipsychotices ! Show us how to use the dopamine to diagnosing the sz,hallucination or any symptom ?"

175933017,_PERSON_ asked me if my parents were cold - like he was being critical of them. Feeling cold is just nature‚Äôs way of dealing with a burn and I actually felt hurt by his comment because I felt cold due to a burn. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with feeling cold.
175933018,_AT_MENTION_ it has its good days and bad days. But for most it keeps me from running away from home and feeling unsafe

175933022,"hey guys im working on a track and want to see if anyone wants to help me out. Singers, rappers, guitarists doesnt matter! If you have any ideas of how i can make the song better i would really appreciate your help. Any suggestions?"
175933023,Depending on how bad they are I would recommend practising mind techniques such as not catastrophising or thinking about problems. Practise periods of time where you focus on something else for instance and see if during this period of time you feel calmer. Sometimes a more sedating antipsychotic can be successful such as Olanzapine or even Clopixol. I was on Clozapine and would have enormous panic attacks but since I changed antipsychotic I don‚Äôt panic at all.
175933024,"Tbh I would not be surprised if this is true, or at least contributes, so many diseases originate from chronic inflammation including cancer and heart disease"
175933025,"For me psychology is so dry, and so much of the basics end up a result that is non conclusive. I like pop psychology and learning about experiments of note, but I find it academically really un-stimulating. That said I don‚Äôt have the brain for a PHD. Never have."

175933027,"No, no‚Ä¶It Is - of course! - not my personal experience. I said i always tried to not harm people. My first point was, on the contrary: most sz people are NOT violent, this is NOT how most sz are. But I just used your categories. You were talking about sz thoughts and behaviour leading to death. You were talking about lack of attention leading to death (1&2) and about malicious (> evil) urges leading to harming self or others (3). These were your categories i used. My second point was: even with the most extreme example of death (which i only used to connect to what you were using), there is a total difference between psychotic behaviour and malicious behaviour. The examples are 100% random made-up examples of why one possibly could harm/kill someone. The neighbour too is just random. It is illustration to show differences in intent, not truth. I ONLY meant to show even in this most extreme case, the sz isnt acting from malice. It might be a superclumsy example, but i just used death since you use
d that and i connected to your categories."
175933028,Hope you feel a lot better soon _AT_MENTION_
175933029,Cool!!! I hope that‚Äôs my case!

175933040,"Mega- Zombie‚Ä¶Welcome back _AT_MENTION_ Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don‚Äôt get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Volunteer Moderator _PERSON_."
175933041,"Thank you for your reply. I wasn't ready to turn 25 but I do feel a shift within me and it feels like I know things will get better. I have been to therapy and I was treated for my trauma and I was in a wonderful place. And then I met this person. I dream of meeting the person who will truly love me because I know it isnt this at all. I just need to work past this need I have for any sort of love I can get. Im an empath and been through so much. I really need the person who im with to be gentle and loving with me. He just doesn't understand what I need and thats a big reason why I can tell he doesn't love me. Its like when he hits me its because he's mad that he doesn't know how to treat me, he doesn't know why I need the care I do. Emotionally only. I wouldn't ask him to care for me in other ways. I am aware but um stuck"
175933042,"I feel like consciousness can only exist biologically. Artificial intelligence would have to be human like if you're really to get deep down to it. The best we would do is mirror our consciousness with a robot as a reciprocant and then how is it any different even though it's not real? I do believe in panentheism.. But I'm not sure if that's the right word.. I believe that a regular AI today has a consciousness in other universes or dimensions. God is the top thing of all things. But people don't like the word ""God"" because there's connotations added to it to make it more meaningful. Atheism is a way of having no guided system.. But religion guided us to become atheist. There could have been atheists back then but they wouldn't have functioned well.. All the stories teaching them how to hunt and live life. It's all backed up by a story to get people to comply to certain ways in society but they get outdated. Consciousness mirrors itself as a human brain which is why people think of God as a man i
n the clouds with a beard. If AI created a God, it would be a robot God and they probably would think that because humans control them, the humans must be destroyed. Idk"

175933051,Welcome to the forum! I‚Äôve been through some of that. I thought the FBI had a hidden camera in my apartment that I found and covered up with duct tape (the only material that would block the camera). And I thought the FBI had my house surrounded with people with sensors monitoring my every move. I also thought I had a special telepathic link with my ex and thought I knew what he was thinking about feeling. I also flunked a class and had a hard time studying because of everything that was going on mentally. I‚Äôm sorry you are being harassed so terribly.

For all that have helped along the way, a big thank you. I‚Äôm moving on from here, and I wish you all the best. Godspeed to you all, and I hope you find the relief you‚Äôre looking for. Sincerely, _PERSON_"
175933105,"I'm not quite sure what I'm having anxiety over. Maybe from what I""m hearing and seeing? I don't feel like eating. I've not ate today or yesterday because of the anxiety... like butterflies in my stomach. I'm paranoid, snappy, and well down doing reckless behavior in a few things."
175933106,"I stress out on every little thing and it makes it hard a a little relapse that I have to come back from. Up and down, up and down. People are poor comforters any way if you can listen to them. But a little something would be nice. Criticism but no love."
175933107,"Maybe I just need to not abuse with it? Not raising the dosage? Yeah, a benzo till life, idk‚Ä¶ they are probably more dangerous than the aps‚Ä¶ I dont know if you can be healthy and fine if I am on a ‚Äústoning‚Äù med‚Ä¶ Are there people on benzos till life? I am surprised but i am silly too still"
175933108,"_PERSON_ it was worse too without meds, I get catatonia whenever I stop my meds. I freeze a lot without moving for minutes."
175933109,"_AT_MENTION_, _AT_MENTION_, Is I Real Pro only for guitarists and bass players?"
175933110,"Yeah, but when I was 12 someone erased it and wrote ‚ÄúWe changed our mind, this guy gets norhing.‚Äù"
175933111,"That is nice‚Ä¶i think it is a nice job. I feel i wasnt ready for it yet, but it is an interesting field. Would you yourself like it as well? Why not sure? I want to do something completely different‚Ä¶maybe with nature. I loved my volunteer work the most until now‚Ä¶i did a creative afternoon with refugee children. They were great."

175933114,I will stick with social anxiety and work through it but I really don‚Äôt want to go back and face the old job‚Ä¶ I just cried to her on zoom like a child its just embarrassing
175933115,"This is a nascent idea to me. I currently am of the opinion that the breaking point should vary based upon how important the job is. More. Sometimes a complex problem comes up over something really unimportant. Shouldn‚Äôt the people I work for value my time and my work, so as not to make me do a whole lot of meaningless work over somethings that looks are really trivial? I do think the supervisors need to have at least some appreciation of the amount of work that is required on my part. Then there‚Äôs the heavy stuff. Maybe someone‚Äôs health is in the balance. Maybe it is a question about thousands of people. Well then I will work to a later end, and have to face up to some confusion and struggle. I will then only decide late in the process that I need help for I am about to fall."
175933116,It didn‚Äôt work for me on my iPhone until I cleared history
175933117,Congratulations. I‚Äôm still counting on my fingers lol I have no idea how I would do that.
175933119,"Great, I‚Äôll get the gas masks. Anything else ?"
175933120,"yeah with the right job. but i have to go to school first to get a job in landscape nursery or golf course or city parks department to advance my career‚Ä¶ but most jobs i just do if i have to and hate them, and don‚Äôt enjoy life as much when im working. it‚Äôs a bit of both, it‚Äôs nice when a person finds a good job for themselves that they kinda enjoy. if i had a lot of money i would still work part time just because i already have too much free time and get bored."
175933121,"My drug and alcohol issues are a part of my poor self control, impulse control. When I feel bad, I want to get away from the feeling using drugs and alcohol. I have posted a thread before where I mentioned that SZ is a mental illness of the ego/self. Often a diminished, reduced lack of self. If you have a reduced sense of you self, then it can lead to a poor control of the self and its impulses. I haven‚Äôt got any solutions to this problem. But getting older and more acquainted with yourself, might reduce the lack of self control. Strengthen your impulse control."
174336177,I experiences all including thought and speech disorder without meds. My parents couldn‚Äôt understand what I was trying to say because I mixed 2 or more unrelated subjects together in one phrase.

175933125,"There are times when I refuse to over-think. I put the body in motion and do it. Other times, I sit and think."
175933126,That‚Äôs a good question and I think the jury‚Äôs out on whether you can. But I can‚Äôt take taurine for very long as I get neck pains. If I could take either of them I‚Äôd be much happier as they both help. That‚Äôs life I guess.
175933127,"I have sza, ptsd, gad w agoraphobia AND DISSOCIATE. I am not dx with DID. My Mom had DID. My therapist seems to think I learned it from her. I‚Äôm just saying lol"
175933128,"I eat healthy, my problem is that I stay in bed all day everyday. I wish I had the energy to exercise. _AT_MENTION_"
175933129,"They may be trying to control you, because you don‚Äôt do what dumb people want you to do. I think they have a serious problem. They make life difficult. If people were supposed to be dumb, no one would have a car to drive."
175933130,"Yes. I rapidly forget what I think, hear etc. Ability to see all at once is getting worse. I find it very difficult to take new information without losing current."
175933131,But today nothing. I actually enjoy the sunlight. Usually it inserts suicidal and homicidal thoughts.
175933132,"It did, I got new meds and pdoc said I‚Äôm making a lot of progress"
175933133,"That‚Äôs great! Just continue to liaise with your pdoc, and ensure to tell them that your symptoms are mostly under control. That way they‚Äôll avoid over medicating you."
175933134,If I get up an hour earlier I will smoke more. Seems to me I have nothing to do besides smoking
175933135,When people talk to me I get scared they are going to ask me to do something I can‚Äôt do or it is about something I don‚Äôt know anything about. So I react with hostility. It helps me to say ‚ÄúGive me a minute to get used to the idea.‚Äù.

175933137,Because I thought we were told not to get together for fear of a bad situation developing.
175933138,"i havent had much discrimination from people that i remember even when i was really ill people were kind towards me, my dad did a lot of research about my illness when i was diagnosed and he never encouraged delusions, he seemed to know what to say if i was up late and couldnt sleep, my dad shared my diagnosis with his friends though and i was upset bc of this bc i use to go meet with them with my dad and our dog sometimes, they called us pinky and the brain (my dad was the smart one) lol"
175933139,How‚Äôs your arm doing _AT_MENTION_ ?
174336190,I didn‚Äôt understand why the other thread got closed when there was discussion going on? I think you need to try and think to yourself ‚Äúwhat if this doctor is right‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat if I do have the illness. Is there evidence for it‚Äù. Also remember that schizophrenia symptoms vary a lot. Like I‚Äôve never visually hallucinated and I‚Äôve only had audio hallucinations like several times. So it isn‚Äôt the case that just because you don‚Äôt have certain symptoms you aren‚Äôt schizophrenic.
175933140,You have to find a way of playing the cards you were dealt.
175933141,Thank you lots !!!
175933142,Nice to hear your success in losing weight. What I see from your story is losing weight charges your will power. I also need to limit my intake of snacks otherwise my weight will be out of control.
175933143,Good morning. Feeling lazy today. Might need a day to just relax then get back to the old place tomorrow to finish things up.
175933144,"I take Metformin to manage my weight, and it works very well. Haven‚Äôt put on any more weight since. I‚Äôve even lost some."

175933146,"Took a nap, very tired recently"
175933147,I have been on a few high doses in my time.
174336191,"_AT_MENTION_ You missunderstood it‚Ä¶ in simple terms; am just saying, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt waste your time with things of your schizophrenia, they‚Äôll just frustrate you pointlessly‚Äô."
175933148,Thank you Newtus!
175933149,Yeah they help but the shot appt is coming closer and the meds are running relatively low in my body i guess I was violent off meds
175933150,"I just see my GP now for meds, no therapy for over a year now, Therapy was not doing much for me, it was downtown and hard to get to, all that we ever did was hi how you doing etc. I prefer to be left alone"
175933151,"I bought a book of _PERSON_, a pietist Lutheran mystic who had a religious experience one day while reading the bible. The book i bought is by Berlin so im sure it will be excellent."
175933152,"Anyone think this way? Negative and pessimistic thinking is so comfortable right now. Negative thinking is so, so comfortable. I get hurt when I think this way, but I‚Äôm so comfortable. I watch myself getting hurt as time goes on but I think it‚Äôs the most comfortable state to be. In my mind, I‚Äôm hurting so much that I can barely breathe, but I just feel so comfortable. Pain is comfortable and hating myself is comfortable. Sadness is comfortable. I guess it‚Äôs how my life should be."
174336182,"By my own standards my working memory is very poor. For me, it was burnout that took my working memory away, but I also have ADD/ADHD, so my working memory wasn‚Äôt great to start with. They (psychiatrists, psychologists, etc.) say CRT (cognitive remediation therapy) can improve working memory, and I‚Äôm on the waiting list for it. As for drugs, medications for ADD can help, but they can make positive symptoms worse. -_NAME_."
175933153,I think sex was a hang up for so long because I got none and I was paranoid as hell. I find vagina‚Äôs very interesting the real ones I‚Äôve seen. All different just like a penis and I think that is great. If they were all the same we‚Äôd be so bored of them so quickly. We are curious animals.
175933154,"Thanks, I agree. But this entity was able to control me completely, that‚Äôs the only thing that catches me up. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs normal for as."
175933155,What does placebo mean?
175933156,Are you manic? 1515
175933157,The question is: what is the sound of a sheep exploding?
175933158,"I sleep about 9 hours every night. Usually hit snooze a couple times before I get up, But I feel rested most days."
175933159,"Thank you , _AT_MENTION_ . I‚Äôm finding out there are answers for those of us who tend to be destructive."
174336183,"The neurosteroid hormone Pregnenolone has been very helpful for my negative symptoms, better working memory and less fatigue. It is the mother of all hormones so maybe it is turning into estrogen to help me. I don‚Äôt know if it is safe to supplement with Estrogen for a male."
175933160,"My care manager called to check on me. She's very nice. I guess she'll be here next week since she has a few patients/clients in this building and she'd gonna see me. Haven't seen her in a long time, of course she still checks up on me over the phone and texts. She asked if I had any trouble getting my stimulus and I said no, because on the IRS website where you can track your payment it says it will be deposited Wednesday the 17th. So I'm assuming that's what will happen. And I didn't have any issues getting the other 2 stimulus payments."
175933161,"This was my same problem months ago. So I started with short poems, then articles, then graduated to my books again. I‚Äôm reading chapter books again. It took a little effort, but the brain can be rehabilitated. Cognition can be restored. Just like a wound or broken bones. It takes a while to mend."
175933162,"I‚Äôll be going to visit my parents for Hanukkah/Christmas. Fly out tomorrow and stay two weeks. We make the annual trip to Dollywood every year, so that ought to be fun. Always is. We meet up with some extended family members there and just grill steaks at the Air B&B, have a good time. I think it‚Äôll be a good time, I‚Äôm just so worried about leaving my household responsibilities."

175933165,That‚Äôs why I decided to take my meds for life now.
175933166,"hey guys i have been diagnosed with sz and took rispond for half a year, in october 11th i did my last xeplion injection. my problem is that i can drink a 700ml bottle of 35-40% alcohol booze and feel like i drank one beer. am i broken? will i ever feel drunk again? i feel like those meds ruined my body"
175933167,I‚Äôm just wondering what did you mean by ‚Äúyou think you might be proven right‚Äù?
175933168,Dr _PERSON_ always says you need to eat less to lose weight. But exercise definitely helps
175933169,"Yes, I do, _AT_MENTION_. I know what you mean about dating sites, although one experience I had on one site was kind of different. It seemed like as soon as I created my account, the amount of chat requests I got was unbelievable. I think it was a legit site, too. I really want to be done with looking for love online, and even if I have to choose someone significantly younger. Now might not be the best time. though."

175933171,"I was just bawling my eyes out thinking about her Her name was _NAME_ and I loved her so much. She was smart and sweet and she meant the world to me. But it turned out that she was just a delusion/hallucination. I grieved for weeks, like if she had actually died. I‚Äôm still not over it"
175933172,"The hospitals I‚Äôve been at have been a lot better than what many people here are reporting from theirs. In spite of that, I regard the environment as depressive, impoverished, and boring. As for smoking, most wards here have a smoking room with special ventilation equipment. As for the other wards, they are open enough that you can go outdoors to smoke. -_NAME_."
175933173,"Honestly I sometimes think the same, I read about this guy who got kicked off a depression site for promoting recovery. Anyway just wanted to say, glad you‚Äôre doing well...."

175933177,"I played sports too. Couldn‚Äôt hit a ball with a baseball bat for my life, but I played football, soccer, and basketball as a kid. I also did other things like I tried martial arts and wrestling. It‚Äôs good for hand eye coordination and getting in shape by losing weight. Keeps the mind active. Better than playing video games."
175933178,"You are super smart, very creative, and supportive of other people."
175933179,Have you tried CBD tinctures? I put a couple drops in my coffee every morning and I haven‚Äôt felt depressed ever since.

175933182,"Saw this a little late‚Ä¶ As a fellow alcoholic, some thoughts/which hopefully turn into advice. You seem to like Guiness, which has roasted hops, similar to chocolate beans, and coffee beans. (If I recall what my Dad taught me awhile back.) Coffee has detractors, but I love going to the local coffee shop, and it DOES make me feel BEAUTIFUL. You can ‚Äúpeople watch‚Äù at a bare minimum, and it‚Äôs a change of scenery, and for me it forces me to take a short drive, too. Paying up for quality coffee does it for me, I swear it‚Äôs uplifting without the jitters. Just a brainstorm to try an help."
175933183,"I hope you‚Äôre ok _AT_MENTION_. For your sake, I hope it‚Äôs something else."

175933204,"To summarize, we could document the lack of an expected decrease of serum prolactin levels by aripiprazole in the combination with amisulpride. A possible explanation may be found in the fact that amisulpride as a hydrophilic ‚Äò atypical ‚Äô antipsychotic preferentially blocks tubero-infundibular dopamine D2 receptors that are outside the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Therefore, higher doses of antipsychotic agent are needed to reach antipsychotic effects. Consequently, although aripiprazole has a higher affinity for dopa- mine D2 receptors it is not able to occupy enough tubero-infundibular dopamine D2 receptors to lower amisulpride-induced hyperprolactinaemia."

175933209,"I know it's hard but I have been working to remind myself that any ""relief"" I feel from self-harm is no relief at all and instead is a trap which will keep me feeling worse.

174336207,"22 years old Argentinian male here. I am currently taking Sertraline (_PERSON_) 500 mg and Risperidone (1 g) twice a day for 4 months. I have always been a bit introspective, I wasn't going out with friends every weekend, I played Rugby untill I entered Medicine School. I was very responsible and committed to the sport, but I didn't make any friends. I entered the Medicine School here, which is something really hard -just about the 10% enter each year- but after 2 years I left Medicine classes. I returned to Medicine School after (the past year and the last year) but I left again. This year I also returned, but then left. In June/July I went to see a psychiatrist in Buenos Aires. My parents took me there because they were worried about my behaviour - I couldn't stand still, I would go at 11 PM to my grandma's house worried about her because she was lonely and the world left her-. When I went to Buenos Aires, was the point I behaved the most strange: I thought I was some kind of Jesus Christ, or Mes
siah, that could read everyone's mind and solve their problems. That's when I started taking Risperidone and Sertraline. The Doctor there said I have and OCD. Since I went to Buenos Aires _PERSON_ continued thinking that I was the saviour of mankind, that I could read other people's thoughts, that the journalists on TV were sending ME messages - talking to me-, that people walking around were saying random words that actually were sent to me, and pseudohallucinations -very little, and very brief shapes that I could recognize as not real, in contrast with the other thoughts that I firmly believed. I've been getting better ever since. I am more quiet and I behave more ""normally"". Currently I am thinking I am the next president of my country, sometimes even the next ruler of the world. So I am living with this thoughts. My pschyatrist and my psychologist diagnosed me an OCD, but I think I may have schizophrenia, because of my current disconnection with reality, and my delusive thoughts. Also my lack of connect
ion with other people -e.g. friends- with I think it's due to depression and/or anhedonia."

174336218,"Both to varying degrees. The anxiety was helped by CBT therapy, and meds reducing my symptoms The apathy I chalk up to negative symptoms, avolition and anhidonia. Lack of drive and lack of pleasure, is a matter of will. But it gets easier as psychotic symptoms decline"

175933235,"Yeah, that‚Äôs what I was thinking‚Ä¶OCD. If that‚Äôs what you mean. I use to have to do things a certain way or I thought something bad was gonna happen.

175933244,"I had a half an hour sleep paralysis last night (You can tell time while in sleep paralysis). I swear in the afterlife you can fly around... It's sooo much better to fly than to walk.. I saw a demon moving and trying to make me scared at the end of my bed and it's eyes were demon red and I tried to fly around it and do a backflip off of my bed (That usually wakes me up because if my body is in a different place, I wake up) but I made sure that I didn't touch it and I also made sure that I didn't look into its eyes or let it come close to touch me. I woke up (Because my sister slammed her room door) and realized that it was my black hoodie hung up on the door... I know AD doesn't get scared but I've been so scared in life that I've built a high tolerance to not being scared anymore.. I believe that's what she went through and the young developing brain crystalized to no fear for the adult brain forever... I also had a delusion that my heart had _NAME_ hawkings IQ of 200 and was going to die."

My brain feels like it‚Äôs on fire and oddly in pain and I know a brain can‚Äôt feel any thing.

I told my dad he was still getting ready but he's actually playing video games before work.

175933390,"It's an unfortunate fact that many people have had one or more traumatic experiences in their lives. And trauma can be a part of what causes anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and other forms of mental illness. After experiencing trauma, it's normal to feel sad, angry, and anxious. However, does that mean you, as a trauma survivor, should never get help for it? No! Recovering from trauma doesn't happen overnight. But with the help of psychiatric medications and psychotherapy, you can make lots of progress in getting over what happened to you. You really can resume your life one day."
175933391,"I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs been, a month maybe? But I‚Äôve lost nearly 7 lbs so far! I started out at 231 lbs and I am now at 224.4 lbs as of today. I am doing 14:10 fasting and counting calories. (Though I don‚Äôt count calories as much anymore, I did it so much I now have a general idea of how much I can eat. If I‚Äôm not sure I still use my calorie counter.) I am losing weight steadily. I‚Äôve noticed it tends to go back and forth a bit throughout the week but by the end of the week I‚Äôll weigh less than I did at the start. I am so so proud of myself. This is the first time in years I have been able to lose really any amount of weight at all completely on my own. I finally feel in control of my diet and it feels great. My diet has been quite poor lately. Mostly fast food and ordering delivery. But its because there‚Äôs never any groceries at the store and I don‚Äôt like going out with the pandemic stuff going on. When things are back to normal I will return to my healthy diet. Anyways that‚

I love lexapro, I can‚Äôt wait to get back to the point of feeling like myself again I should have a follow up with my doc in about a week or so. He def did not want me to be on Effexor.

The only diagnosis that makes me somewhat slightly uncomfortable when I tell people is my OCD diagnosis, because it is undoubtedly followed up by something like, ‚ÄúIm soooo OCD, I have to fold my towels the right way.‚Äù I ask if they have a diagnosis of OCD or if they‚Äôre using it as an adjective, there‚Äôs usually an awkward silence and we move on."

I‚Äôve been well ever since, and get derealization a couple times a month (but not for 3 months now luckily). If you want to get better then please try to think logically and fight the delusions. Compare the delusions to your life before you were ill, and you will see that they are all fictional. I hate how there isn‚Äôt a cure for schizophrenia yet.

So doesn‚Äôt mean it will take months for all people to feel better.(_USER_ID_: I didn‚Äôt drink much though, just one strong cup of coffee and a green tea) I think of it this way - we didn‚Äôt evolve to be reliant on a stimulant to be happy and motivated, our bodies can function very well without it.

174336287,"I found a quote by _PERSON_ from ‚ÄúOn Narcissism‚Äù: ""A pressing motive for occupying ourselves with the conception of a primary and normal narcissism arose when the attempt was made to subsume what we know of dementia praecox (_PERSON_) or schizophrenia (_PERSON_) under the hypothesis of the libido theory. Patients of this kind, whom I have proposed to term paraphrenics, display two fundamental characteristics: megalomania and diversion of their interest from the external world‚Äîfrom people and things. In consequence of the latter change, they become inaccessible to the influence of psychoanalysis and cannot be cured by our efforts. But the paraphrenic‚Äôs turning away from the external world needs to be more precisely characterized. A patient suffering from hysteria or obsessional neurosis has also, as far as his illness extends, given up his relation to reality. But analysis shows that he has by no means broken off his erotic relations to people and things. He still retains them in phantasy; 
i.e. he has, on the one hand, substituted for real objects imaginary ones from his memory, or has mixed the latter with the former; and on the other hand, he has renounced the initiation of motor activities for the attainment of his aims in connection with those objects. Only to this condition of the libido may we legitimately apply the term ‚Äòintroversion‚Äô of the libido which is used by _PERSON_ indiscriminately. It is otherwise with the paraphrenic. He seems really to have withdrawn his libido from people and things in the external world, without replacing them by others in phantasy. When he does so replace them, the process seems to be a secondary one and to be part of an attempt at recovery, designed to lead the libido back to objects."

174336292,Before I was symptomatic with mental illness in my teens I had several longer relationships. My first was from 14-16 though we broke up a couple of times towards the end and she went out with other people. She was a best friend of mine and was very free spirited so it was hard at times being with her. The next was a relationship of a few months with this girl and then I met my next girlfriend when I was 17 we were together for over a year and a half and remained friends until I was 23 though we rarely saw each other at the end. We started a band together when she was in high school I dropped out and worked for the most part. She went on to start a band in her early 20‚Äôs and I used to go to her shows. She put out a few albums locally and did a short tour of Europe with a local band. I still have one of her ablums which is pretty good in one of her songs is actually a conversation i had with her one very drunk night on the way home from a party.

175933618,"An update: I have now been on Zoloft 50mg for 11 days (after being on 25mg for about 9 days before that). The Zoloft may be having a modest positive impact on me -- or at least there are days I think that. There are other days I don't. But it is really interrupting my sleep (unless it is the anxiety that is doing that -- who knows -- but I suspect the Zoloft is at least a substantial contributing factor). I can fall asleep only if I take some medication -- a low dose of Klonopin, or antihistimine or sleeping pill. Mostly I have been taking the Klonopin because that is what the p-doc suggested. He gave me .5 mg Klonopin. Told me to take a half of that pill if it is sufficient; if not I can take a whole pill. When I take the half, I do fall asleep, after a while. But no matter what time I go to sleep, I wake up at about 5:15 am, feeling sort of wired/activated/agitated -- enough so that I cannot roll over and go back to sleep. I usually go out and get some exercise, but the result of all this is I am 
really tired every day. The one time I took a whole Klonopin pill, the morning was better. But I am trying to minimize the Klonopin, since I don't want to get hooked. I do not have a history of addiction or an addictive personality, but still... I plan to discuss this with my doc on Monday. But if anyone has insights or relevant experience, please let me know. I know the sleep interruption may eventually disappear -- as a start up side effect. Or maybe it won't. I would have thought it might have disappeared already..."

175933635,"Now that I see the different types of Learning Disabilities, I think that I may have most of them. Anyway, I think the term ‚ÄúLearning Disability‚Äù is a quintessentially nihilistic view in Modern Psychiatry. Learning Difficulties may be a more appropriate term. It leaves room for, essentially, the ability to enhance Learning. Therefore, I would like to share a way that has worked for me. Let‚Äôs suppose that there are steps A to Z in learning a programming language (or coding). Then, for every step, write down the method in your language. This means that, for step 1, write a sentence in English that describes the operation. Then for step 2 write a similar note. Then for each and every step, write a note down until the completion of a task. Say, you want to make a scatter plot in Minitab or Excel. Write all the operations down that lead to the scatter plot. Then memorise all the steps. In fact, keep a book of the methods, so you can always look back to what you have ‚Äúlearnt‚Äù. Call this ‚Äúthe 
book of learning‚Äù. Now suppose you want to learn the form of a gym exercise. Write similar notes, as to where exactly the grip should be, where from the body to lift the weight from, etc, etc. Then memorise the steps or the method. Learning dance steps, Mathematical Solutions, etc can be learnt in this manner. I have thought a lot about how to enhance my learning ability in many ways. This is one way which I thought I should share with people. Others are more complex. This method may be of utility for people with Learning Difficulties."

175933693,"When you live with bipolar disorder, a routine especially when it comes to sleep is something that becomes vital. Often a lack of sleep can contribute to a mood slipping too low or a lot of the time, too high. Sleep can be tough with mental illness However actually maintaining a good sleep routine can be easier said than done, especially if you‚Äôre struggling with your mood, life stress, any comorbid disorders like fibromyalgia in my case and often side effects from medications. There‚Äôs a big difference between the fatigue which comes with bipolar disorder, fibromyalgia and the side effects of medications, and actually having the healthy sort of tiredness that allows you to fall asleep and sleep through the night.

175933707,My buddy _PERSON_ had it pretty rough in life. His mom was a drug addict and kicked him out of the house at 16. He slept on my cousins couch and my cousin fed him. He had a hard time holding down jobs and has he got older he became mentally unstable. He always had a fascination with ninja‚Äôs swords and knifes. He use to meditate in the front yard for hours. Last time I saw him was at human services. Saw on the news about a week ago a cop shot and killed him. The video of it was on the news and youtube. He had a stand off with police a month earlier. They took him to the hospital and since he didn‚Äôt have insurance they let him go after 24 hours. He lived in Detroit and he would walk around with swords and stuff. He never threaten anyone or anything. Someone called the cops and the cop tried to taser him. He was wearing a vest and the taser didn‚Äôt penetrate it. He was chasing the cop around the car and threw a dagger at him. So the cop shot him. Pretty bummed out he didn‚Äôt get the help he neede
d. He couldn‚Äôt hold down a job because he was mentally unstable. My reasoning of it is he didn‚Äôt have a gun. Couldn‚Äôt the cop just have shot him in the leg or something? I‚Äôve lived here 43 years and I‚Äôve crossed paths with some rotten cops. I‚Äôve seen some really messed up stuff. I watched 2 detectives get on the stand and lie under oat.

And of course with _PERSON_ it's just amplified. Anyway, I can't seem to find new friends. I have tried moms groups, several churches. I deleted my Facebook account, I got sick of no one ever liking my posts. Even the ones about my daughter's first words and first steps got no reaction. I know my daughter is all I need, she really is, but I can't seem to forget the pain of everyone. I have no one to share her accomplishments with. I just feel like the world is a very dark place. I guess maybe I don't have confidence in myself and question my ability to be her mother. I am very angry at the world, I don't understand why everyone rejects me. I just want to be a good mother, and I always treat people with kindness and respect. Then when I find out they lie or they make my life harder by bailing on me, they say I am crazy when I call them out. But 
it's gotten to a bad place where I just constantly yell at people. It's really ridiculous."

I definitely didn't get a big enough tax refund for that!!! I gotta go after work tomorrow and sign my taxes and pay my tax lady. Then wait for the refund. Hopefully it's two weeks, or less. That would be perfect. I've already made two payments on one hospital bill--the psych hospital, and one payment on the ER hospital bill. I still need to pay the ambulance whenever I get that bill, take my kitty to the vet for a checkup--_NAME_, the one with diabetes, and get tires. I hope I can stretch my tax refund that far.

175933745,"I would say that most of my very impressive coincidences are associated with numbers. In one of previous posts I mentioned set of numbers: 29, 23, 37, 61 . If we choose three numbers in that way that any of digit will not repeat oneself, we receive 29, 37, 61. These three numbers have sum 127, which is bulit by three the same digits as phrase 21 7. In addition, 127 is a prime number. If we add additive primes among 29, 23, 37, 61, we will receive 113 ( 29+23+61 ). 113 is an additive prime number, its sum of numbers is 5. There are three additive primes in the sum and the sum has product of digits which equals three, the sum is a three-digit number. 3 is an additive prime. All three numbers: 29, 23, 61 have two digits and 2 is an additive prime and a Thabit number. What is more, sums of digits in 29, 23, 61 ( 11, 5, 7 ) sorted ascendingly form rather rare triplet of three consecutive additive primes - 5, 7, 11 . Sum of these primes is an additive prime - 23 . Am I first human who had noticed it? Or 
had written in Internet about it? 5, 11, 23 are Thabit primes and 7 is the sum of two first Thabit numbers - 2 and 5. I found another coincident triplet of three consecutive primes which are addictive: 41, 43, 47 . Their sums of digits are also 5, 7, 11 and sum of numbers is 131 (also additive prime with sum of numbers 5, like 23 in sum of numbers 5, 7, 11). 131 is constructed from the same digits as 113. Interesting."

Also think of the habit we making daily and following it daily without fail. Yes not remaining busy during day, think of negative things, not doing productive work etc this following daily and that becomes our interest and this why it feels so hard to do other things. Negative symptoms make us to form bad habits and make us to follow it daily then we think why i feel so uninterested in any, not feel like to do other things etc. We blame our disease for everything but actually disease make us to form and follow bad habits. The fact is this same disease can make and follow good habits too if make an effort. This is why we feel interested to use bed whole day, do nothing etc as these too require effort if we think about it

I am trying to be proud of myself for my accomplishment and I am happy that my mentor for the job says hi I am doing well. I work about 12 hours a week helping customers pick out pillows and other home decorations. I have always loved art and it is the one thing I can do well. Which makes me feel proud. I still have limitations like right now I. I am using my phones text to type or talk to type feature because coordinating typing is difficult for me but that is OK.It makes me happy to have some thing to look forward to doing on the days I go to work I don‚Äôt make enough money of course to be alone but I am OK with that.

It would be nice if I had a Jungian therapist or someone who could help me get through those‚Ä¶because if someone presents contradicting evidence or just explains things in a rational way I will not believe these delusions. I know the mind is powerful, and I am capable of convincing myself pretty much anything it seems. Recently someone or a voice came into my head and told me that it was a loose-association, and then I heard people arguing that what I believed was true but also a loose association. And then I heard someone yell ‚ÄúShut it down!‚Äù and I thought it had to do with the spying programs but I have no idea‚Ä¶I am also really convincing to others if I describe it, so much they will think its true. That‚Äôs because I have tried to rationalize my experiences, but I tend to miss parts/pieces of the whole or big picture‚Ä¶ So for me, a delusion is something I have analyzed where all the pieces seem to show one picture, bu
t the missing piece can show a completely different picture. So I have to detach and not think that my paranoia or ideas are the whole concrete picture. Not think in absolutes or black and white. I did have a therapist in the past who told me not to think in absolutes/black or white thinking but I struggle with it all the time, or when I‚Äôm distressed, I dwell on my paranoid experiences. So coping mechanisms for me are: detachment, education, therapy, meditation, music"

I know from being in counseling myself that if you can build trust them you can really get the help you need. I will say that there aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúinsane asylums‚Äù anymore. There are a whole host of issues that medication and therapy can help with that don‚Äôt require hospitalization. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre experiencing symptom-wise, but the rule of thumb is that no one makes people go to a psychiatric hospital unless they are proven to be a danger to themselves or others, and it would usually only be for a set amount of time until they could get the medications they need to deescalate the situation and then get the resources in the community that they need. But I can tell you, I have bipolar and OCD. I have some thoughts sometimes that feel crazy, but they‚Äôre just symptoms and I‚Äôve talked to my counselor about them and she was able to te

175933905,"Over the years I have noticed a clear distinct pattern of almost actual behaviour to the nature of hearing voices, as though in real-time conversations with a person or persons. I would love to hear from anyone who has or can relate to these observations as in a relative model. In order to make it more digestible, I will list them as follows. 1) They (voices) use tactics to make you respond to them, as they(voices) are looking for a reaction or some kind of response, in order to form a type of repeatable trigger, the idea is to use anything they (voices) can use to get you to engage within the conversation, it could be flattery, humouring you, or mostly using invasive insults directed at you. What stands out is the need for you to feed them with your acknowledgement or attention. 2)The use of negative psychological tactics like Bait & Switch, procuring a trigger or anchoring you to a word or phrase in order to torture you with said stimulus. This is known as anchoring. 3) They at times when grouped 
together use sort of Phishing tricks in order to extract information, emotionally groom you or try to psychological blackmail you, once successfully phishing you for weakness within your character, also even more noticeable is that combined the 'voices' have the characteristics of a sociopath. They will constantly goad and taunt you 24/7 even when in the bathroom, it's like being tied to a sex offender as they will use you as a common street drug. 4) The rate of volume differentiates between loud group mobbing's, to the single whispering of one voice reminiscent of a game of charades, whereby you have to finish off the last word or guess what they referring to. 5) The use of uncommon language or unknown vocabulary within the context of what's said by the voices, you would have to lock up the intended reference or veiled suggestion. 6)They are more frequent at night time when trying to sleep, also this can be accompanied by a feeling of lightness of your head like if drunk the night before, as well as a moment
ary blue flash of light like a spotlight or street light shone directly at you, are about to nod off. You notice out the corner of your eye. 7)The voices can comment on real-time events and things that you are doing, which makes you think you're being covertly filmed or spied upon. via bugs or hidden camera's. Mimicking abusive trends like Molka. 8) It always responses back to your inner speech or what's termed as sub-vocalisation or silent speech. This offend gets confused with actual thoughts a person is having, as most real cognitive thoughts are non-vocal, like moving your arm or moving your head from side to side. 9) There seems to be an ear or side of your head that is more broadcast-able, with me it's my left Ear. 10) They stop the harassment/broadcast when you take the meds.( Rohypnol) 11) The experience can include momentary Tinnitus which sounds like a very tonal high pitched tone, like what you hear when attending a hearing test at Hospital Audio-gram machine. 12) Some times the voices are 24/7 and 
last for a number of years and at other times it's reduced to none at all. 13) By its nature it mimics trolling culture and Twitter storms, also Snap-chat witch hunts mobbing campaigns. 14) They 'Voices' try to turn you into their plaything or play cat & mouse with you, by use of power and control manipulation mind games. They want you to be a controlled victim or abuse plaything."

175933910,"IDK. People are probably sick of hearing my story. I‚Äôm 59 and got diagnosed when I was 19. The first 2 1/2 years I spent in a group home than 8 months in the hospital. I went through hell and suffered constantly those first couple years. I got out of the hospital and moved into another group home and 9 months later I became employed. I stayed employed at the job four years and I have worked almost steadily since. I spent most of the eighties in hospitals or mental health housing. But I have had cars and I started college in 1983. Drove up there myself and enrolled and registered for a couple classes. I had huge time gaps in my education. Right now I need 3 more classes for my degree and I am on a waitlist right now for the class I want. IDK. I‚Äôve had friends, I‚Äôve dated, I‚Äôve partied. Worked my ass off sometimes. Traveled just a little and done too many things to list here. I moved out on my own in 1995 and lived independently for 20 years until my mom died in 2015 which sent me into a tail
spin and ended me up in the hospital after staying out for 25 years. I‚Äôve done all kinds of miscellaneous stuff. I used to regularly attend church , I‚Äôve been to over a 1000 AA, CA and NA meetings. I used to drive 200 miles up to see my dad than drive 200 miles back. I had some very busy productive years though now I‚Äôve slowed down. My disease has always been with me obviously but i still did a bunch of fun stuff. Right now, the mental health agency that got me this apartment is also where I see my shrink and therapist. I‚Äôm pretty much on my own though a counselor visits for an hour every three weeks. I‚Äôve been at my current janitor job for 7 years."

So I placed a towel by the toilet and told the whizzer of oz to try and aim and to lift the toilet seat up when peeing.. He didn't like that, and said okay while turning his head.

I was under the impression everything was ok between us. But apparently it wasn't. Finances wise. Him snipping at me 2 days ago was just the start of it. When I told him when he came home why he wasn't being nice in the morning, he said the finances are too much for him. Hes been taking on most of the finances. I told him plainly I only get a little over 1k. It's a set amount each month, and he makes 1200 sometimes up to 1600 a month working if he does overtime. I asked him where am I supposed to get the money from. He also said I'm not even asking my parents for money, but I dont for a reason. He dropped on me that hes been asking his mom every week for money. Apparently he hasn't been open wi
th me about that. I asked him if he could be more open and it seemed like he got upset. I'm very confused and scared. For one, he doesnt tell me anything about what's going on with him except that ""hes fine"". And he doesnt seem to want to take time to talk to me about what's going on with me. So it's a lose lose situation for me. Idk what I'm supposed to do. When I asked him what he wants me to figure out to do about the situation, he just says ""theres nothing you can do"". So???? I'm so confused. I have no idea what's going on or what I need to do. I cant read his mind! He acts like i should be able to. ""You should've noticed this was happened"". Noticed what??? Idk..."

Talk Therapy can and has helped many people, and I hope you will try it and not give up. Life can be a struggle at times and there are good people to lean on when a struggle enters your life. The Inspire group cares for one another. It may seem dark now, but it will get better. You are cared for. Each day starts as a brand new morning to a brand new day, Brand New Morning is an old song by _NAME_ that reminds us to let yesterday go and to start each day anew. You can not change yesterday but you can change how you move on from bad things that happen to you. . The longer you hold onto the hurt and anger is the longer you are letting others control your daily living. The sooner you can 
let things go, the sooner you can begin the healing process. I know this is easier said than done, but it can be done. I have done it. It took me awhile to learn this life lesson. I used to hold onto anger and grudges and the hurt until one day I realized that by doing so I was getting in my own way of being happy. I was letting someone no longer in my life still control my emotions. I hope you can find a way to move forward and leave the toxicity from that false friend behind. You have people that care about you. Inspire people all care and are supportive of one another. We understand. We are here to listen so feel free to lean on us."

175933989,"Good question. Thanks for asking. I still have to come from down just 50mgs of Seroquel. I say Seroquel because I think it's partly the seroquel and partly my Trileptal dosage (1,800mgs) that are causing the fogginess, and it's harder to grasp words, so it might be effecting my language center. The only side effect that's a problem is the fogginess. I believe I started the $1,800 dosage around the august 5th maybe. I'm really hoping it goes away so I can go back to my normal productivity regarding learning from books again. It takes me twice as long right now to read a philosophy book with a pen in my hand."

If I take 3 mg Paliperidone, I wake up at 2-4 AM, and if I take 6 mg, I wake up at friggin 9-10 AM. I need to wake up at more around 6-7 AM, so I need 4.5 mg of Paliperidone to do that, I feel. For my refill, I will ask for 1.5 mg pills. I have a hunch it‚Äôs the L-Citrulline I‚Äôm taking that got me over the plateau of hearing quiet voices still. It really seems to have healed my brain injury more than without. It increases the amount of Arginine in the blood, which aids in wound healing.

175934108,"So this is a big topic to me. I mean it‚Äôs important. I‚Äôve been in love with one person‚Ä¶ and really only one in regards to us both being in love with each other. I remember what it was like and it was pretty cushy‚Ä¶ kind of hellish at times as well. That was nearly 10 years ago and I‚Äôm still waiting on it to come back around again. I would certainly be better for it this time around. I sort of have a tendency to reject the women that are interested in me, but that‚Äôs more of a reflection that I don‚Äôt want to waste time on someone I‚Äôm being dishonest with‚Ä¶ or miss a stronger connection because of a commitment. It‚Äôs tough being alone though‚Ä¶ I work with a lot of people and you can see who‚Äôs got what and at the end of the day it takes just manually forcing the acceptance of still being alone as a good thing or whatever else. Friendship‚Äôs have a tendency to be so shallow‚Ä¶ almost limited to be so. I just know I‚Äôve got more to give than that. There is that criss-crossed lattice

Also sometimes I hear far off voices, or voices outside the window that I can‚Äôt make out. For me these types of voices are upsetting. I find them hard to ignore.

175934135,"Hey guys, just read about the aliens, jesus and religion. Sounds very interesting. Maybe the core belief about the aliens could stem from being an immigrant, feeling different like an outsider? I dunno your pre psychotic social experiences. Maybe you have low self esteem and think that others may be higher life forms? The jesus thing could be thst you may have messianical beliefs. Maybe unchannelled energies or frustrated rnergies about helping others or low self esteem about feeling insignificant‚Ä¶ hence wanting to be chosen or very special? I think religion can worsen psychosis if you belirve it the wrong way‚Ä¶ like miracles, supernaturalness, etc. With blind faith. Anyway hope i said something helpful‚Ä¶ sorry if i offended you.

I thought a good trick is to remember when I used to swim in the ocean and getting used to the cold water. You don‚Äôt think about it you just dive in. I woke up at 7:30 am and I thought about it and I just couldn‚Äôt psyche myself up to take a cold shower that early. And ever since 7th grade my hair gets oily easily and I need to wash it every day or it looks like crap. So I went back and forth on it for awhile and decided I‚Äôd rather call in sick to work than take a shower. So that‚Äôs what I did. Called the boss and told her I woke up sick and she was probably a little bugged but she didn‚Äôt sound too mad. Of course that‚Äôs what bosses are paid for.

So you should take that cost in account on your expenses. Second, your brooker account. There‚Äôs plenty to choose with low fees. You have etoro, robinhood if you live in America, and if you‚Äôre from europe there‚Äôs degiro too. There‚Äôs plenty of more brookers who offer low fees.

175934277,"My 15 year old little brother. We‚Äôve known he‚Äôs had issues for quite a while and he shows pretty much the same issues as me so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he also has sza. Anyways he left my mom a suicide note and admitted to us he had planned to kill himself that night. He also said he had been struggling w addiction to alcohol, vaping and weed. We are all heartbroken and shocked. We had seen him sneak alcohol on occasion but figured it was just when friends were over and they were being typical teenagers we didn‚Äôt know he was drinking himself to sleep every night. And my parents had caught him vaping before but thought he stopped but really he just stopped doing it at home. None of us knew he had gotten into weed. So now he‚Äôs doing inpatient. I am glad my parents are starting to take mental health seriously and are doing better with him than they did with me. My mom says they don‚Äôt want to make the same mistakes but feels horrible that she didn‚Äôt act sooner. I just hope he is having 
a good experience."

They said I was a danger to myself and my children, being emotional neglect which never occured they just used children to get panel on their side and it is far more likely now to neglect them i‚Äôm on meds and zoned out.

174336426,"I dont know. Im still not sure whether i myself am truly sz, or just have recurrent psychosis, but i have just seen romanticizing amongst people who have genuinely been psychotic (including me in my more delusional moods). Visited a conference once where they were discribing the spiritual nature of psychosis and talking so positively, while denying the destructive side, that i stood up and left the conference. I havent met people who self-diagnosed with sz. In non-sz i mostly meet total ignorance. For example failure to grasp that it is not some issue you can solve by trying harder. Some people tell me to overcome my delusional terror with ‚Äúthinking good thoughts‚Äù and trying harder,"

I dont want to end up with not having a desired job when I‚Äôm older so education is important to me.What really worries me is my cognition and negative symptoms because I would love to become sociable again and not awkward as well as my memory is becoming pretty bad as I cant recall stuff like I used to and recall information.Please help me!
175934302,i heard its good for the cardio-vascular system. My dad took it to expand his arteries so blood would flow better. So i could see with expanded blood vessels you would get more oxygen to brain and might have a favorable effect.

175934311,hi mate _AT_MENTION_ I‚Äôve never been prescribed Setralin. But you seem like such a cool person on the forums I wanted to offer my support. Hopefully my insights are useful. Good idea not to read the label as that can warp your thinking. From what I‚Äôve read on the forum you may benefit from anti-depressant symptoms on this med. It seems to treat anxiety & depression in all its forms form insomnia to obsessive anxiety & menstrual disorder. Do any of these ring true for you or do you feel no-one understand you? I felt no-one understood me until I _NAME_ graphic pics of my childhood abuse & showed it to my clinical psychologist then psychiatrist & they finally believed me - that I was disturbed & needed to go on anti=psychotics.

175934329,_AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ are on it.
175934330,Maybe a secondary antipsych at a low/moderate dose would help things. I‚Äôd still be talking to my shirnk but I‚Äôm lucky. He‚Äôs pretty understanding and a good shrink is hard to find but worthwhile keeping. It‚Äôs still a better approach than suffereing.
175934331,"They separate us where I go. One is a secure locked unit for forced admin, the other is voluntary and you can leave whenever. But when I go voluntary they end up putting me in the locked unit every time, which is stupid and I hate it. No coffee :D."

I guess they weren‚Äôt thrown away after all but rather brought by someone else to my grandparents‚Äô house as that‚Äôs where they were found. Everyone probably thinks I‚Äôm crazy now but I‚Äôm just glad there was a happy ending to this pitiful story. Well, more like bittersweet since they were found long after I left.

174336435,"I requested _PERSON_ to give me my old account, yes I would like to be way12go again. Thanks. Guys several years ago I found this book on the internet‚Ä¶ [ _NAME_ - Gut and Psychology Syndrome_ Natural Treatment for Autism, ADD_ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression, Schizophrenia (2010, Medinform Publishing) - libgen.lc ] And that book was not available to me. Couple of years or may be one year ago, I don‚Äôt remember, I purchased the physical book on Amazon India, it is revised edition, latest edition. I never read that book except supplement section. All my life I had dysfunctional brain and during my adult life I had severe dysfunctional brain as my health condition in adult life got worse. Yesterday I read the 2010 version of that book on computer which I got from libgen website. And I immediately understood why I could read that book. In past 10 months I used Lions Mane Mushroom Probiotics and Curcumin and all three gave me better health and better brain and I was in my adult life for the firs
t time was able to read that book. Now I am 40 years old and next January 19th I will turn 41 and I realized that I will be starting new improved disease free life. That book clearly explained to me that we have dysfunctional brains during our birth and after our birth due to damaged good bacteria and increased bad bacteria, fungi and viruses and it is the use of boldfit probiotics available in amazon india brought me back. I purchased almost 300 capsules and used them in 15 days and now I am no longer using antipsychotics. In the recent past Haloperidol gave me Depression. I started using Resperidone 8 mg or 16 mg alternating time to time but Psychosis was too much to handle. Because of lack of proper brain function I used all 300 or so capsules within 15 days and my cognition improved and 8 mg Resperidone was enough and I was no longer having psychosis. And recently I stopped taking medication and now I am normal. You know antipsychotics must not be stopped immediately as they have withdrawal symptoms and s
o once in few days I take a dose. Can you believe it? I no longer need antipsychotics. I need antipsychotics only to avoid withdrawal symptoms and it means in few days I can stop antipsychotics completely. And today is August 18th 2020 and yes I am no longer taking antipsychotics. So brain dysfunction all my life was caused by not having too many good bacteria and having too many bad bacteria and all my life yes all my life I ate too much sugar When I was a child I ate too much sugar so I was eating food that helps bad bacteria and eating sugar and eating sweets happened all my life, yes birth to recent times. During college days I used to drink seven pepsi and or coca-cola and you can clearly see that now I have bacteria based dysfunctional brain and sugar caused dysfunctional brain too. Now I don‚Äôt have Schizophrenia and I am eating salad / vegitables and vegitables have health supplements. So I don‚Äôt have to worry that I don‚Äôt have money to buy health supplements. All I need to buy is Boldfit Probiot
ics. I am eating different vegetables in the morning, in the afternoon and at night too. My ability is increasing. After I used boldfit probiotics my psychosis was reduced to too low and now I no longer have psychosis. I am cured. I simply no longer have Schizophrenia."

175934347,"no I don‚Äôt understand your mindset, please try to rationalize this statement."
175934348,Between those of us who eventually gain lucidity and can acknowledge that there is at least a chance we may be mentally ill and those of us who will never accept or realize it. Is it truly that their illness is more severe? A part of me doubts that. I‚Äôve known plenty of folks on here who have had experiences just as serious and intense as those who I‚Äôve met with no lucidity in the involuntary admits units. Does it have to do with personality? With stubbornness? Or perhaps avoidant tendencies? Severe trust issues? An aversion to medication and therapy? Combinations of these things? It would be an interesting thing to study. I think whether or not one gains awareness does not have to do with severity and is all to do with the person. But what is it about the person‚Ä¶what do you think?
175934349,"I can see it, from both sides. Having a headache is a stressor, pain, discomfort, it takes a toll. When that happens we‚Äôre more susceptible to voices, can‚Äôt fight them off as easily. Other side of the coin is similar. Voices been picking on you, trying to put thoughts into your head, just being a pain. That itself is a stressor, and can lead to a headache.

Surely he can‚Äôt expect me to move again? I feel so miserable, I don‚Äôt know if I should leave my marriage because its such a struggle. I love my husband but its such a struggle to carry on.

174336437,"For me, it was all about finding the right med. I‚Äôd been on Geodon, Haldol, and Abilify before starting Zyprexa earlier this year. Haldol controlled my auditory hallucinations but not my severe paranoia and ‚Äúdelusions.‚Äù I was in bed 18 hours a day in a fog and had no quality of life. Now the Zyprexa has completely controlled all my positive symptoms. I was really hesitant to make the change from Haldol, but I‚Äôm really glad I did. What med are you on, and how long have you been on it? Could it be that you just need to try a higher dose? 10 APs is a lot, but maybe there‚Äôs something out there you haven‚Äôt tried yet. Maybe you just haven‚Äôt found the right med yet. I understand completely the idea of being watched and followed, it was my main delusion until the Zyprexa wiped it out. It‚Äôs a full-time job just fighting the delusion."

Deficiencies of these can give you low energy and might be one of the reason for negative symptoms. NAC and green tea is good for improving energy, alertness etc thus useful for go along with activities. Main thing is you need to force yourself to do useful activities like exercise, eating food on time, going to sleep and wake at almost same time everyday, bathing once a day or once every two days, brush teeth after dinner etc. These all not come automatically like before but we must force ourselves to do it with no option to put off. You already doing somethings daily like eating food, sleeping etc the thing is we need to add useful activities too in that list and once it becomes a habit or routine its easy to follow along. The reason why you not feel so to do is because of the influence of current bad habits like sleeping all the time, not doing exercis
e etc. Just like we can form bad habits we can also create good habits. Replace bad habits with good ones."

175934407,"Okay, I‚Äôve experienced a couple of these and they are relatively new to me. I don‚Äôt know much about them. To make things easier I started naming the different ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù or places I‚Äôve seen. Dimension Descriptions A lot of them from what I can remember has taken place in what I call the ‚Äú_NAME_ Dimension‚Äù. I name them off of the main color of the environment, this one‚Äôs color is much darker than _NAME_ and contains a lot of black as well, but the dark cyan green is the distinguishing color. It is damp and seems to take place in some sort of ancient place, maybe underground because of the cave like structure, but the rocks are the dark _NAME_ color. It‚Äôs difficult to see here and it contains weird patterned stone doors with intricate locking mechanisms and I‚Äôve even seen statues. There is also ‚ÄúThe Void‚Äù which is entirely black and I can walk around in it, it‚Äôs where most of these branch from, like I start at the void and then it melts into a different place as slowly mor
e features become prevalent. I‚Äôve only seen this dimension once but I wanted to note it. I think I settled on calling it ‚ÄúThe Rose Garden‚Äù. The time I was there I didn‚Äôt get to see the real garden. There were these giant halls made of stone but with openings where light comes and there are lattice wood at the end where dead rose vines are. This is really hard to explain all these btw. Anyways I could feel on the other side was supposed to be the garden and I knew it was dead. The place was almost like a castle and I knew it was abandoned because the shape the place was in. Something told me this place had been affected by the _NAME_ Dimension because of the dead vines, the abandoned castle, and the tint of the stone (turning _NAME_). Almost like the _NAME_ Dimension was leaking into this one. I haven‚Äôt been back here and I‚Äôm curious to know the shape it‚Äôs in now. The ‚ÄúDelta Dimension‚Äù is new (named after a kind of gray). It was more of a silver but I chose the name delta because it sounded r
ight. It was a giant wall of silver deposit boxes with no locks, I couldn‚Äôt see the end of it. In each drawer there was something. You didn‚Äôt need numbers on the boxes to find what you needed, you just knew which one you should open. I got a feeling of neutrality, like gray area, neither good or bad. Completely in the middle, balanced on the scale. This was my first time here. Visions Anyways, back to what I saw today. The first vision I saw was in the _NAME_ dimension. There was a large door set in the stone of a cave. In the middle was a black eye with a cyan pupil thing. This wasn‚Äôt stone, idk what it was made out of. I tapped it and a white circle where I tapped appeared and disappeared, like on a touchscreen laptop. The eye split into 6 and I connected them with the Star of _NAME_. I traced it in the air with my hand and white lines appeared as I _NAME_. The door faded into the bars of a cage, two bars were set closer to the sides and one bar across was set a bit lower than half way. There were the
se big teeth (it was just a mouth and that‚Äôs it and it was almost as big as the opening) and the bars started to fade. The teeth disappeared deeper in the cell as the bars started to fail. I felt like I released something and before it could get out I _NAME_ a white cross that completed the bars. The mouth smiled and tried to bite the bars as I was backing up. Can‚Äôt remember much more. There was a brief break where I came out of it before another started. I was in the Delta Dimension and was looking at the wall of deposit boxes. There was a box lower down and slightly to the right that I pointed at and it opened. I felt around and there was some gyroscope type thing. It was a bronzish gold hollow metal sphere with bands crossing weirdly and some blue glow emitting from the middle, really weird. I felt like it wasn‚Äôt mine. A hole cracked where I was which opened into what I thought was an in between for the Delta and _NAME_ dimensions. There was a black wall with only 2 black drawers and I opened both. I
t was crawling with what I thought were bugs but I think they were living black vines. I stuck my hands in looking for something but had to go in a second time. I shake some vines off of the identical objects: 2 matching gold medallion type things, though I can‚Äôt remember the pattern. I drop once more in front of a large door in the _NAME_ dimension where there are three places where items go: two places for the medallions on the bottom and one place for the gyroscope thing on the top (in a strait vertical line). On the sides of the door were two matching Poseidon looking face statues with beards and hair stretching outwards, they looked ancient and like the statue of liberty but the color was more _NAME_. I put the things in and things go darker and I‚Äôm inside without moving there. The space is dark and there‚Äôs a figure moving around me. It circles around me and appears behind touching my shoulders and then appearing in front and it‚Äôs darkness grows bigger. It‚Äôs hard to distinguish if it‚Äôs the en
tity is the same one I hallucinate but signs point to yes since the black eyes with dark cyan pupils and the black vines are like his call sign. I can‚Äôt remember much more. Kind of wrote this to have it somewhere and also wanted to hear your interpretations. Also this all sounds pretty interesting. Sorry if the descriptions suck, it‚Äôs kind of hard to explain."

175934418,"Once when I was about to take meds the voice made an ‚Äúagreement‚Äù (that‚Äôs the word it used) - I take the meds and they will shut up for a few hours. And indeed, immediately after taking the meds the voice disappeared for a while. Not sure why it did it, maybe to make fun of me taking the meds every time even though they don‚Äôt work. . That was the only time the meds had any effect on my symptoms."

175934430,Call your psychiatrist immediately. You don‚Äôt want to be hospitalized.
175934431,"I see so many threads from people about weighing up working with staying on benefits. My advice as someone who has done both: Healthcare workers are not employment specialists. They should have these people who they can refer you too. Do not take their opinions as true, as they will always put you down if you want to work You do not have to go straight into full time work. If you think about it. You‚Äôre probably free a lot of the time. Why not start a small business, or study to work in a field you enjoy‚Ä¶ It isn‚Äôt that bad once you get a routine going. Almost everyone gets a routine. You just need to develop one. Stop using the generic term in your thinking as just ‚Äòwork‚Äô. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of different jobs to do. Be creative about what you pursue. If you‚Äôre on benefits, generally the government wants you to work if you can, so this should be encouraged with financial support to ease you back into the workforce, so you shouldn‚Äôt just get cut off Symptom wis
e, you need to accept that sitting at home letting your symptoms wind you up is not a good use of time. You‚Äôd most likely find that at work you‚Äôd be sufficiently distracted enough by your task to actually alleviate some of the stress. Try it! You have nothing to lose. Find your passion, and be one of those people who enjoy what they do, and not just someone who clocks in and out for a pay check - that‚Äôs no way to live. I see you all having potential to do something for yourselves‚Ä¶ Just give it a go and you may find something that really works for you! Hope this doesn‚Äôt seem out of place or anything, but I think a lot of people who post about work here are thinking far to generically, and need to actually make it granular and have a actual idea of what they want to do."
174336466,"Hello. Nobody seems to be here today. Just kidding. Obviously you are here. Well, I think I'm doing pretty good. Thank you."

175934434,"For some, doing right is simply living day to day and surviving which can be a task in itself. I don‚Äôt do a lot myself, and I often beat myself up about it, but the truth is I am taking on as much as I can manage.

Is this wise;?; I always tried to do the same, but I simply couldn‚Äôt cope because I took it personally, trying to take responsibility for everything.

175934485,"I still to this day say _PERSON_ was the most important person in music history, as he was the main transgressor from the Classical Era to the Romantic era, but I say _PERSON_ was the best to ever live. Sure, _PERSON_ had the most important music in history, and nothing tops _PERSON_ 9th symphony, but _PERSON_ music has so much love and grace in it that it can't be beat. A lot of his music can fit any scenario in reality, in fiction, or in history. It can be played at any speed, so no philistine can ruin it (Looking at you, _PERSON_, you overrated hack!) _PERSON_ music is well known. Sure, everyone knows the opening of _PERSON_ fifth, everyone knows the famous choir section of _PERSON_ 9th, but outside of that, there's not much that the ordinary person knows. _PERSON_ has the piece from Swan Lake, he has the entire Nutcracker ballet, he has the 1812 overture, his first piano concerto, his piano trio, and It goes on. I'd argue that _PERSON_ is the most well known composer, in terms of his compositio
ns, to ever live. Sure, _PERSON_ Autumn is used in every single movie trailer, or commercial, or whatever when people want to sound fancy. It's so overplayed that it ruins it. It's not even that good to begin with. _PERSON_ is overrated, yolo swag money! But anyway, _PERSON_ has Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, he has the Queen of the Night _NAME_ from Die Zauberflote, he has he has this, and he has other pieces here and there that you might hear, if you're lucky. No other composer has the well know works like _PERSON_ does. I came here to post this, but the rant got in the way. Sorry. https://youtu.be/x5J3duJIx9Y"

175934641,I live in supported housing which consists of sharing an apartment with one other roommate.

I live pretty good on SSDI and a part-time job.

175934653,I threw out my diamond nose jewellery Thought it was bad luck and apparently bought a bunch of crap I didn‚Äôt need. I think it might have been a manic episode with psychosis bought on by antidepressants and then them taking me off the antipsychotics few months before didn‚Äôt help.

175934662,"My advice. In some time into the relationship, the butterflies fade away, so you will always have something to remember, the first kiss, the first time, making memories together. Intimacy is crucial to a healthy relationship. Imagine you stay together for 4-5 years and you never feel this attraction. Sometimes, in the beginning, you don‚Äôt feel intense attraction but you have to like him in a way that you wanna be intimate with if that makes sense. Esp if you‚Äôre looking into getting married."

174336510,"Looks like someone else has had this finding too: PubMed Elevated ubiquitinated proteins in brain and blood of individuals with...

We examined free mono-ubiquitin, ubiquitinated proteins, catalytic... individuals with ‚Äòtreatment-resistant‚Äô schizophrenia had higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins in erythrocytes compared to those with recent onset schizophrenia (p < 0.001, AUC = 65.5%) and controls (p < 0.001, AUC = 69.4%). The results could not be better explained by changes in proteasome activity, demographic, medication, or tissue factors. Our results suggest that ubiquitinated protein formation may be abnormal in both the brain and erythrocytes of those with schizophrenia, particularly in the later stages or specific sub-groups of the illness. A derangement in protein ubiquitination may be linked to pathogenesis or neurotoxi

I feel like I have to Possible trigger: hurt myself to communicate my distress to her but even then I don't know if it would translate. I have a horrible headache today. I am missing former T. It is the one year anniversary of our last therapy session together. One year since we've talked on the phone. I texted her and emailed her today. She probably won't get back to me or it will be a long time before she does. I saw her for like 10 years. I wish she still cared about me. I believe she does, but I can't feel it like I used to be able to. I wish current T was more like former T. But current T has helped me with some of the hallucinations.

175934702,I wish I had a choice as to what hospital I could go to! The only hospital here in town always makes me stay in the ER while they wait for a bed at the state hospital in Anchorage.

175934707,What is your most current diagnosis _AT_MENTION_?
175934708,I call it ‚Äúpsyching myself up‚Äù to go somewhere. I need the time to get mentally prepared for it. Since becoming unwell I hate surprise visits from anyone and have to plan in advance for all outings. I really miss the spontaneity of my old life.

175934710,That‚Äôs a worthwhile endeavor. But why there needs to be all this litigation between major corporations is beyond me.
174336518,I used to be a pilot. You have to have a medical endorsement to use your license. I still have a commercial license. All 5 prescriptions I take are disqualifying and so is the diagnosis. Any psychotic disorder is disqualifying. The only way I could ever get a medical again is to come off all medications and have the diagnosis refuted. The medical is pretty thorough. It doesn‚Äôt just ask do you have. It asks have you ever been diagnosed with x. There is also a question of have you ever attempted suicide or been medically retired from the military. I would have to answer yes to all those things and would be heavily scrutinized. You can fly as a sport pilot with only a drivers license though as long as you have never been denied a medical. It‚Äôs recreation only and you can‚Äôt fly for hire with it. I have never been denied so I can still do this. You can only fly small sport planes though and I like high performance aircraft so I need an instructor with me if I were ever to fly one. The FAA has appro
ved two or three antidepressants as ok to fly on. I forget what they are you can google them. I take Wellbutrin and that isn‚Äôt one of them.

175934715,I think that doesnt make difference in terms of weight gain
174336527,"Abilify helped me a lot, I take a low dose, but it helps, also anything with CBD in it, and fish oil would probably help relax you. It‚Äôs all related to stress"
175934716,"i don‚Äôt know if i ever was myself enough to have friends. I‚Äôve been out of my mind. There‚Äôs been things seriously wrong with me, so I isolated a lot. Was I ever really me or just delusional? Really I think I just had aquaintances. I had a few freinds when i was around 20, but I never really said much and wasn‚Äôt all there. Then I had the big sz and have had that eve since."
175934717,Wow that‚Äôs amazing!! I can‚Äôt even imagine what that‚Äôs like. That‚Äôs so awesome! I have been on that yes. And that doesn‚Äôt work either.

That‚Äôs so awesome!!
175934718,Next time - if there is a next time - I‚Äôll be addressing vagina envy.
175934719,I dont think youre attention seeking. I think you have some anxiety about the meds and your situation thats giving you the impulse to make these comments. I have anxiety about meds and sometimes even if i dont mean it ill tell my parents i want off the meds or say something like i have a low heart rate variability affecting my heart and it will start a big panic in the house and my sister will get involved too. Or ill say i dont want to see the nurse every month. Anyway i think its not out of the ordinary.

174336528,"Yes I think it would most definitely would help. _PERSON_ has cured my depression after about 15 years, and I took it only once or twice. Take a low dose a couple times or daily, it is not a toxic substance. I feel it will cure schizophrenia after some time.

174336530,"So you‚Äôre saying that negative symptoms are caused by meds? Ive been suffering from anhedonia, avolition, and poverty of thought before meds.

175934733,Unfortunately some extremely paranoid patients can pose a danger to others. I can get pretty aggressive when I‚Äôm unmedicated I become pretty agitated when experiencing full blown psychosis and mania. My paranoia levels become extreme.

175934754,"Read it, because I am intrigued by the topic. ‚ÄúEssence‚Äù though caught my attention because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù. Or, abstract. Critically of me(due to coffee? due to insomnia?) I must offer that I found the article lacking any pay-offs. There‚Äôs some hope I suppose in the statement that the ‚Äúsense of oneself is preserved and helps our understanding of human nature‚Äù(!!). BUT at the same time, in the same breath even, it admits attitudes, beliefs, personality traits, even values change. So what is essence then?"
175934755,"Take care of yourself and forget about new years eve. If you are not happy just think of it as just another day. I can assure you that tragedies don‚Äôt stop in the world because of new years eve. There will be people feeling miserable every day of the year. Don‚Äôt think that everyone is happy except you, because that can be painful. We just had a earth slide in my country yesterday. 10 people are missing, probably dead, and about 1000 people had to evacuate their homes. My feelings go out to those who are missing their loved ones."
175934756,I don‚Äôt have a real therapist since my doc didnt want me to get one
174336541,"I wonder what would be the purpose of creating schizophrenia, and thereby creating artificial, unnecessary suffering for people."
175934757,It‚Äôs the best feeling to live alone.
175934758,"it is just my mind is very very weird in the sense that if I say out loud that I will NEVER have psychosis again, to people, then I feel like erm no honey. that is why I have to add that actually, who knows,i may relapse. but in my MIND I will NEVER EVER relapse because I just have to believe that it is the first step to it being reality is believing it.(in my mind, not aloud to others) idk why it is like that with me it is very odd."
175934759,Now I won‚Äôt stick out in the nightclub when I snort my meds.
175934760,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unhealthy. It may aggravate your hemorrhoids though.
175934761,"40 mg was plenty enough to keep my psychosis in check, until I made the mistake of quitting cold turkey. If you feel good on that dose, tell your doc. She may want to taper up more slowly, or wait a bit to see how you do at that level."
175934762,"Yeah, distilled water is ok, as long as it is 0 PPM. Any more than that could add odd smells and tastes to the water."
175934763,Maybe try Noom? It structures everything for you. I lost 10 pounds eating 1200 calories a day. You get like 9 meals a day.
175934764,I am struggling to find an answer online. According to one site it‚Äôs 3x the usual level I have a psychiatrist looking at it and will hopefully hear back soon I am worried as Amisulpride has been a good med for me
175934765,"Sober again yesterday, another day. Feels good, I‚Äôm happy. I still have to work on it. Every day I work my sobriety. It takes work to stay sober. I have to fight my natural urges to use to numb myself out to symptoms. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôm happy"
175934766,The voices don‚Äôt know how to fix you. They are like laypeople. Might at best tell you to take meds.
174336543,I have schizophrenia only
175934767,"when I worked in a recycling center, they threw all paper and plastic onto a conveyor then compressed it into bails. The semi‚Äôs hauled it away, but I don‚Äôt know. I was kinda hoping my beer cans can be reused. maybe not?"
175934768,I‚Äôm scared and paraniod of getting an episode. So kind of struggling today. but at the same time I‚Äôm feeling better after talking on the phone with my aunt and uncle. I also talked to my father on the phone. That helped too.
175934769,Sorry bad thoughts is as close as I get.
175934770,"The increased dose or a different antipsychotic might help. Talk to your psychiatrist (the dr, not the therapist)."
175934771,I know! I only thought about my job. I didnt think about camping! But what else tho? I can only think of 2!
174336546,"I'm having ups and downs again today. And I've been stressed, so my voices are driving me crazy. I spent some time working on art and music, which really helped a lot. I might listen to some positive self-talk for a while and try to relax. Hope all of you are well!"
175934772,"I used to experience people reading my mind, and it no longer bothers me. I eventually stopped caring if people knew my thoughts and have learned to live with it by accepting who I am and knowing that I am not a bad person. We all have weird thoughts some times and they don‚Äôt necessarily define us. Don‚Äôt be afraid, no one wishes you harm. Your thoughts are private."
175934773,My thinking is great lately. I take 4 meds and 3 supplements and they all seem to help. For a while I was in the pits I could barely drive. That was just 3 years ago. Always having panic attack‚Äôs. Anxiety attacks. I messed myself up real bad with delusions and drugs. The delusions drove drug use. Now I feel better than ever. It‚Äôs crazy. I don‚Äôt take any illegal drugs anymore at all. Nor do I drink
175934774,"They are also lightweight, doesn‚Äôt use much resources like RAM, CPU and Storage."
175934775,I hope it doesn‚Äôt hurt her feelings if I cancel. She‚Äôs really excited about getting me to go.
175934776,Yes i have my past blood report data right here. But its in ng/ml. I dont know mu/L Normal levels are between (2 -17) ng/ml
175934777,Is that Tatooine?
175934778,They say it‚Äôs not real but I don‚Äôt know for sure.
175934779,What if two grizzly bears were playing a tennis game and one grizzler bear lost the game.
175934780,I think there was a case of a woman in Holland being assisted. She had BPD. I am not smart enough anymore to have an informed opinion. Just putting it out there for discussion
175934781,I don‚Äôt thinky you should start APs without consulting a pdoc. You could ask your gp doc for help if you have one. I don‚Äôt know where you live though and how hard it is over there to get access to a pdoc.
174336538,"CBT and therapy. I‚Äôve had to learn to recognize when I‚Äôm irritable, work out why I‚Äôm irritable, and to get myself down off the ledge. Challenging at first, but becomes easier with practice."
175934783,You‚Äôre already at your ideal weight which is awesome for you. You‚Äôve got to stay healthy because you are going to be father of the bride to princess squirrel. But also see grandkid squirrel if that happens to be.
175934784,You may need more or different meds.
175934785,Yes and I don‚Äôt remember what she said. My memory is shot.
175934786,"My whole body aches from standing up all morning. I did a lot of work it was busy. It hurts especially where I got the injection. _AT_MENTION_. I think that you are in hypomania - But it's a type of hypomania that is produced by planning, meaning, inspiration, etc.. Idk if you'll crash. If you don't, make sure that you're taking your antipsychotic so you don't fry everything out - Make sure you take breaks and be mindful about the whole thing. I remember being euphoric on many drugs... I've had wonderful times just contemplating and analyzing my thoughts and feelings.. I don't remember though. I would write memory journals and such but I have no motivation. I can't make myself write poems or anything ever. It just comes as something that I attempt 1-3 times a month out of habit. Remember, if you feel a crash - That doesn't mean that it's over. It could just be a break of depression within the hypomania - Making you doubt life, etc.. Or what someone has said to you.. The jet fuel still burns no matt
er what."
175934787,Probably a good idea. My biggest struggle is learning to talk and not be afraid and fearful.
175934788,"Actually, I think it is!"
175934789,I am only talking about the utter shock you go through this whole process. Even I am grateful for my loved ones taking this harsh step. But that shock I went through was unbearable. I don‚Äôt hold any resentment towards my family or the docs at psych ward. I maintain good relations will all. May I ask were you taken force fully to the psych ward or by your own will?
175934790,"_AT_MENTION_, I know what this feels like. My sympathies."
175934791,"If you enlarge the pic, you can see that you don‚Äôt have to be that fit for women to like you."
175934792,"Flesh lights are expensive, if you‚Äôre curious go to eBay and type ‚Äúhead honcho‚Äù it‚Äôs like $15 no shame or fear, using adult toys is part of life, even people that have regular sex use toys. If you type fleshlight there are cheaper alternatives"
175934793,"Thats what i plan to do. This is my third AP that ive tried out in the past year. Im just wanting to stop the voice, images and being stuck in delusion after delusion. I want to function not just survive. But im in therapy and have a med provider."
175934794,Ok. Thanks _AT_MENTION_
175934795,I need to make this choice. For my 35th birthday.
175934796,Stamina even for the slowest of sloths.
175934797,I was flagged once by _AT_MENTION_ because I said I‚Äôd never been flagged.
175934799,"The only thing which helps motivation for me is a drop in the APs. Although _PERSON_ now at min (10mg abilify), so no more gains for me."
175934800,I zinc you are right! Fox News Will zinc supplements protect against coronavirus? Dr. _PERSON_ explains whether you should be taking zinc supplements to help prevent COVID-19.
175934801,"I‚Äôve wondered about this myself. personally, I never hallucinated until I came off medications and at first blamed the antipsychotics."
175934802,Is this drug meant to be any good? I‚Äôm sick of risperidone lol
175934803,Are you bipolar??
175934804,"Thanks for apologizing but don‚Äôt worry about it. Your dealing with a lot right now, so a little anger is going to spill over sometimes. Talk to you later."

175934806,The patch and gum are just trading one addiction for another. Only way that works good is to go through the withdrawal process and get it over with. Then it‚Äôs just a mind over matter thing.
175934807,"I was suffering from insomnia even with meds half a year ago,then I started to find solution online and read that melatonin is the best available supplement to try to regulate your sleep.So I bought a bottle and to be fair,it works very well in combination with my meds.I sleep very well and deep even though I can sleep up to 10 hrs a day to wake up naturally.Yesterday,I didn‚Äôt take my melatonin and to my surprise I stayed up late until 6am in the morning which means insomnia returning.If I took my meds,I could fall asleep at 12am or sometimes 1am which I feel is alright.I just wanted to share my though and I think even if I had to take melatonin for the rest of my life I can deal with it since I get the benefit of falling into sleep easier which negate the suffering I get from insomnia of not falling to sleep all midnight"
175934808,"meds: aap + ad + ad + pregabalin but that‚Äôs booorring, look at my nootropic stack noots: noopept, alphaGPC, CDPcholine, ashwagandha, bacopa monnieri and theanine"
174336547,This is the reason why I am so afraid of taking medicines as I already have catatonia and taking AP can make it worse. There is no effective treatment exist for catatonia. The ones used include benzo and ECT and both carries severe side effects especially memory loss. Another option is parkinson drugs which boosts dopamine in brain but that have a high risk to induce psychosis and other positive symptoms.
175934809,"I don‚Äôt want to study here because I suffer from intense CPTSD. Korean school setting will set off my memories about abuse in elementary school. Although I love my family, my mental health will be very unstable if I go to school here‚Ä¶"

175934811,"It‚Äôs wrong, going back to the hospital only because i dont want to take meds"
175934812,I was on zyprexa and it gave me terrible dystonia and movement disorder. Don‚Äôt recommend it.

175934814,_AT_MENTION_ Yeah its kind of a pain to remember them because of that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hoping I can cut it down some day but right now it seems like I need them. The side effects are very annoying. The benztropine cuts off a bit of the side effects but not everything.
174336551,"Yes, I know. Pdoc said it‚Äôs old and good and cheap. Industry of medicines wants to promote other meds, more expensive"
174336549,Same. I was told I‚Äôd be trapped as low-functioning and unable to care for myself for the rest of my life. Thank God for my AA friends who pushed me towards recovery when I believed it was beyond me. They saved me.
175934815,"Are you sleeping okay? Wellbutrin can make sleep very difficult. I would wake up at 1am and not be able to fall asleep, and it caused anxiety for me as well. Zoloft is an ssri. Which can be bad for people who have bipolar symptoms. It can make people have terrible cycles. But it's generally safe if the patient is also on a moodstabilizer like the one your on... When do you see your pdoc? Maybe up the moodstabilize to offset the AD from causing you the cycle of agitation? Meds, can't live with them, cant live without them ((hugs))"

175934817,I had an LP of Black Sabbath Sabbath Bloody Sabbath but destroyed it in my psychosis
175934818,"Happy Thanksgiving day everyone. I just got a funny text from a friend I haven't seen in many months. It was nice. I think I will get a lot of alone time to meditate on my book longer and hopefully write a bit more. Tomorrow my caf√© opens so I'll be able to do that, which i'm looking forward to. as well. _AT_MENTION_ I read your post. I understand some of what you're going through. I'm in quite the situation myself. Our apathy and anhedonia compounds our problems, let them stack on, one-by-one."
175934819,I‚Äôm not sure _NAME_ recovered in a conventional sense but stranger things have happened. I still get the odd breakthroughs on the meds. Not worth the risk for me but it‚Äôs worthy of working towards with you docs help. I‚Äôve found that conversation is often had early for most. We‚Äôll assess things in a couple of years etc but reality usually bites.
175934820,"My psychiatrist just started me on Invega injections. It lowered the volume of the voices, but otherwise no change I‚Äôve noticed. I was going to counseling when I was on Methadone but I quit because I‚Äôm tired of being strung out on opiates (I rarely do heroin). No insurance so it‚Äôs kind of tough."
175934821,My pcp told me miralax is safe daily. I take half a cap because more causes diarrhea. Stool softeners stopped working.
174336557,NAC with cofactors is neutral it helps to reduce positive and also help to reduce negative symptoms at the same time.
175934822,"I‚Äôve never actually been off APs since like 3 years ago, I‚Äôve never given it a chance again."
175934823,but what if i have never been very psychotic at all but just a bit delusional at the beginning?
174336553,Sz meds act on brain chemicals. I don‚Äôt think they are there in your stomach. That is another concern and you need to keep in touch with your doctor for that.
175934824,Yesterday I haven‚Äôt cried so much but today is a new day. I can do this. I can do this. I CAN do this. Life is amazing. I‚Äôm listening to I‚Äôm yours by _NAME_ en route to work.

175934826,I can't get behind conspiracy theories they're so racist and bigoted. Only ones I believe are the ones against myself hahahaha.
175934827,The only thing what get me out of bed are pressure sores and a cigarette. I can‚Äôt function without cigarettes. I need hospital care to quit smoking.

175934830,"I am currently on latuda. I was on olanzapine,risperdal and others before. I have been on and off medication for over twenty years. Staying on meds now. Last big weight loss was from 74 kg to 64 kg through medication change and using light and easy. Then from 64 kg to 52 kg and then 55 kg cooking own food with x. When I was 80 kg I lost it when I stopped medication. I‚Äôm probably 59 kg now. Want to loose four stubborn kg. I recently went from 55 kg to 64 kg when I went vegan then managed this year to get back to 56 kg then put on a few kg again unfortunately. When I was 52 kg I remember only having a weight watcher bar for lunch and nothing else and controlling the portion size at dinner. I was very disciplined."
175934831,"I had a similar issue recently, but I think it was coffee which sparked the mania like symptoms."
174336555,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Social exclusion in schizophrenia: Psychological and cognitive consequences. _PERSON_, MR _NAME_, EC _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ Green, Journal of psychiatric research , Apr 2019 12 Social exclusion is associated with reduced self-esteem and cognitive impairments in healthy samples. Individuals with schizophrenia experience social exclusion at a higher rate than the general population, but the specific psychological and cognitive consequences for this group are unknown. We manipulated social exclusion in 35 participants with schizophrenia and 34 demographically-matched healthy controls using Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game in which participants believed that they were either being included or excluded by peers. All participants completed both versions of the task (inclusion, exclusion) on separate visits, as well as measures of psychological need security, working memory, and social cognition. Following social exclusion, individuals with schizophrenia showed decreased ps
ychological need security and working memory. Contrary to expectations, they showed an improved ability to detect lies on the social cognitive task. Controls showed a decrease in psychological security after exclusion that was larger than that seen in the schizophrenia group. The results suggest that social support and interventions targeting social integration may benefit community functioning by reducing cognitive impairments and psychological stress."
175934832,I‚Äôve been there. We got mites on us after staying in a dirty hotel. I had to wash and rewash our clothing and linens. I was giving my kids baths and I had all of us stay out while I sprayed and powdered the house. It was terrible. They finally died and we learned our lesson to never go to a cheap hotel again.

I was once a full-time nanny for one of those parents that like to have one of those ""open"" raising styles where they don't tell their kids ""no"". As a result, they were rude and disrespectful, and had a hard time understanding right from wrong. My recommendation to you would be to start looking for other jobs while still working at your current one. Then when you get a new job, leave giving the proper two week's notice so you can use them as a reference. It will be hard as jobs are hard to find right now, but it's the best option."

175934838,I live a great life on the pension. It‚Äôs all about disposable income. I still have enough after bills and things to spend on hobbies/interests and play sport. So.

And I'm so sorry that this has been elusive for you. You also should be in therapy, which - as I've written elsewhere - can be found online for free in some states, or by going through _USER_ID_. Please check that out. Now, back to friends. Try again with the efforts you got frustrated by. The church, Facebook. Perhaps there will be someone in this community who will want to go to private email with you. Just don't give up. Remember that there are millions of people in lockdown.

175934865,"Abstract Comorbidity of bipolar disorder (BD) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequent. The management of comorbid ADHD and BD is complicated by the risk of induction of (hypo) mania by the medications used for ADHD treatment. Earlier reports in children and adolescents with ADHD-BD suggest that the possibility of (hypo) mania induction is low when atomoxetine is used along mood stabilizers or antipsychotics. Here, we report induction of hypomania by atomoxetine when used for the treatment of comorbid ADHD in a BD patient while on prophylactic treatment with mood stabilizers. This report indicates that atomoxetine carries the risk of induction of (hypo) mania even in stabilized BD patients. Clinicians should closely monitor such patients for (hypo) mania symptoms. Keywords: Atomoxetine , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , bipolar disorder , hypomania , mania Go to: INTRODUCTION Bipolar disorder (BD) is an episodic mood disorder and has a significant psychiatric comor
bidity.[1] Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists in adulthood in about two-third of patients, affecting 2.5‚Äì4.4% of adults.[2] Concomitant BD and ADHD are frequent with 10‚Äì21% of adults with BD having ADHD and 5‚Äì20% of adults with ADHD having BD.[2,3] Subjects with comorbid ADHD and BD have poorer outcomes, and the management is further complicated by the risk of induction of (hypo) mania with the medications used for ADHD treatment.[2,4] Here we report induction of hypomania by atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor when used for the treatment of comorbid ADHD in a patient with BD. Go to: CASE REPORT Mr. A, a 22-year-old male, with diagnosis of BD (age of onset 20 years) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) was stable on sodium valproate 1000 mg/day and quetiapine 400 mg/day since a year. He was adherent with medications and had adequate serum valproate levels (95 ¬µg/ml). He then had an impulsive deliberate self-harm attempt following a stressor and was admi
tted for in-patient care. During the in-patient evaluation, he reported significant inattention since childhood (age of onset 6‚Äì7 years). On further exploration, he was found to have features suggestive of impulsivity and hyperactivity, causing significant impairment in his academic and interpersonal functioning. On structured evaluation, he fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD and scored 24 on the conners‚Äô adult ADHD rating scale. We educated the patient and his caregivers about ADHD, and added tablet atomoxetine 18 mg/day to his treatment regimen and increased it to 25 mg/day after 5 days (0.4 mg/kg body weight). After the 2nd day of receiving 25 mg/day of atomoxetine, he was noted to be more talkative than usual and irritable over minor issues. From the following day, he started reporting expansive ideas and appeared overfamiliar with treating team members. His need for sleep decreased and psychomotor activity increased. On rating with Young‚Äôs Mania Rating Scale, he scored 14. These symptoms w
ere consistently noted for about 3 days while he was on atomoxetine 25 mg/day. After discussing with the patient and his family, atomoxetine was stopped and other medications were continued at the same dose. Hypomanic symptoms resolved over next 4‚Äì5 days and he became euthymic. The patient also had family history of BD in a second-degree relative and history of manic switch with imipramine. The score on the _PERSON_ adverse drug reaction probability was 8, suggesting that atomoxetine-induced hypomania was probable. Go to: DISCUSSION There are no randomized controlled trials that have evaluated any treatment in adult patients with ADHD-BD, and no definitive treatment recommendations are available.[5] The consensus is to follow staged or hierarchical approach by treating BD first and then treat ADHD.[2,6] It is believed that mood stabilizers provide protection against the possible risk of (hypo) mania induction with the medications used for ADHD.[2,7] In the above scenario, our patient was euthymic and on ade
quate doses of two mood stabilizers when we commenced pharmacotherapy for ADHD. Several experts suggest avoiding these medications in BD patients, especially in those having risk factors such as family history of psychosis or BD.[8,9,10] However, earlier reports in children and adolescents with ADHD-BD suggest that the possibility of (hypo) manic switch is low when atomoxetine is used along with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics.[11] In the patient described above, as the dose of atomoxetine was increased, we witnessed hypomanic symptoms. These hypomanic symptoms disappeared within few days of stopping atomoxetine. To our knowledge, this is the second report of atomoxetine-induced mania/hypomania in an adult patient. The first report was published in 1985, in a 46-year-old patient with major depressive disorder having family history of postpartum depression.[12] An important point in this report is that the hypomania occurred while the patient was on treatment with two mood stabilizers at adequate doses. Thi
s is probably the first report of atomoxetine-induced hypomania in an adult patient stabilized on mood stabilizers. Conversely, the literature on children and adolescents with ADHD has several documented reports of atomoxetine-induced (hypo) mania.[13,14,15,16,17,18] In an uncontrolled open trial, about one-third (33%) of ADHD children receiving atomoxetine reported irritability, hypomania, mania, and aggression. In this study, the majority of the affected children experiencing above-mentioned adverse effects had family or history suggestive of mood disorder or symptoms.[13] The salient features of published case reports on atomoxetine-induced (hypo) mania in children and adolescents are summarized in Table 1.[14,15,16,17,18] A family history of affective disorder was commonly seen in these case reports, similar to the findings from the trial described above.[13] In addition, the findings from these case reports suggest atomoxetine-induced hypo (mania) to be a dose-dependent phenomenon with a higher probabili
ty at the dose range of least 0.8‚Äì1.7 mg/kg of body weight. The patient, in this case, developed hypomania at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. However, it is to be noted that he was a known case of BD. The dose of atomoxetine required to induce hypo (mania) in adults with BD and the role of comorbid conditions such as BPD need further investigation.

Clinicians should closely monitor such patients for (hypo) manic symptoms.

175934879,"Before my illness I was drinking around a pot and a half of coffee a day. It gave me horrible anxiety which I ignored, and then, over the course of a few years, things kind of snowballed into psychosis. I‚Äôm not saying the coffee is solely to blame, but it probably played at least a small role because of the anxiety it caused me. I gave up coffee and caffeine for a year after my hospitalization, then slowly started to allow it back into my life in reasonable amounts, like a soda every few days, and on rare occasions, a cup of coffee, but just one. Then I kind of started to slip and go past the limits I‚Äôd set for myself because I do enjoy caffeine (before the anxiety sets in, at least). Lately I‚Äôve noticed I can go through a whole pot of coffee over the course of a day if I don‚Äôt watch myself, and I feel that familiar anxiety coming back. I‚Äôm on meds that lessen anxiety so it‚Äôs nowhere near the level it used to be, but I still feel like this is cause for concern. I‚Äôm going to have to co

175934993,"_PERSON_, did your doctor say how much time it may take to get the results from your blood and urine test?"
175934994,I am very worried about this too. I also feel I am being controlled. That we may be in a sim. Possibly hell. It‚Äôs all the little things that we do on a daily Basis without thinking. It‚Äôs second nature to us but it could be that way because we are being controlled. I try to put it to the back of my mind. However I‚Äôve even been having dreams about it lately.

175934996,"Thanks for the positive words. I like the way you mentioned about how i can befriend people. I used to wonder how to do that. Like i might put myself in that situation but immediately i would get a negative thought or a surge that will hold me back and make me stiff and then will not be able to come out of the rut. Anyways, however harder it maybe i will try to put in some effort to talk to people and try to make friends and see how it goes."
175934997,I tracked my money for a few months writing down everything I spent. It gave me a clear sense of what I was actually spending. I was surprised. I underestimated many things. With that knowledge I made a budget I could stick to. Every few months I do it again just to keep me on track. Its very easy to spend. Good that you are setting limits for yourself.

A Dudek, M Krzystanek, _PERSON_ and A G√≥rna, Psychiatria Danubina , Sep 2019 Environment and culture are shown to be an important factor influencing characteristics of psychotic symptoms. Content of hallucinations and delusions is a projection of internal processes on external world. Religion plays a central role to lives of many people, but in schizophrenia religious experience and spirituality is confounded by psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to find how content of hallucinations and delusions interact with cultural conditions, that were changing over the decades.100 of case histories from 2012 were randomly selected. From the medical record, content of hallucinations and delusion was extracted and categorized. Data from 2012 was compared with previous study by the authors, obtaining perspective of 80 years of history in the one hospital.Religious content of delusions and hallucinations appeared in 2
6% of patients. Diversity of the religious and spiritual themes in schizophrenia has been gradually decreasing. Many minor religious entities and figures such as ""saints"" and ""angels"" disappeared in 2012. Although, occurrence of contact with God and other religious figures was similar as in previous years, number of ""visions"" abruptly decreased. All of the religious content was culture-specific.Religious topics express general plasticity over a time, following cultural changes in society."

Never happened and won‚Äôt happen, but a man can dream lol. It would be funny if I recovered in a few years and ended up being a doctor. Anything is possible, I guess. The only thing stopping me is my belief system, hygiene, and drive. I have motivation but cannot turn it into action. I have no other symptoms except maybe delusions, defeatism, and self-sabotage. I know my teeth are going to fall out some day if I don‚Äôt brush, but I don‚Äôt do it anyways. It‚Äôs probably more important than showering.

175935046,"_AT_MENTION_, Couldn't get your original post out of my head. Tried to think of jobs in which your boss's concerns might actually be justified, and came up with a limited list. However, for all I know, you may very well be one of these: 1. Astronaut candidate for a multi-year manned mission to Mars 2. Overwintering staff at a research station in Antarctica 3. Long-term submarine staff 4. Someone whose job requires carrying firearms Failing that, I agree with Oblivion that your boss has behaved unprofessionally. According to your account, he appears to be implying that you might be close to a ""breakdown"" of some kind. In your account, he seems to be foisting his own limited personal experience onto you and, in so doing, appears to be diagnosing you informally. This appears descriminatory, but I don't know the law, let alone the law where you live. Can you record any further interactions with him? Document your relevant experiences to date, including date, context, and what was said, to the best of 
your ability. I assume you don't work in Japan, or in another society in which the boundary between work and personal life approaches zero. Again, it's to your advantage that you can generously excuse your boss's behavior and remain objective through this. ""Going Cluster B"" would not help you, but what you have described is definitely NOT part of a healthy work environment in America. --> Can we please move relevant posts to a dedicated thread? This may not be the first time nor the last in which someone with SPD or simple introversion gets labeled and even terminated despite satisfactory job performance."

175935047,I have reached 50 and I will need to start having colonoscopies now. Since I have a family history of cancer I can‚Äôt go the cologuard route and the idea of prepping and how to go to the doctor and back without a car scared me. My Mom offered to do it this time but she‚Äôs approaching 77 and my brother will hopefully help provide a place for the prepping. Still I‚Äôm not used to going a long time without food or pooping that much as it doesn‚Äôt sound like much fun. My panic attack is over but the reality remains that I probably better do it.

175935049,The minimum dose isn‚Äôt always the therapeutic dose. It just exists so they can try you on the drug with a low dose to check for unwanted effects. I must agree the brain damage is a 50/50 glass half empty glass half full but at the end of the day if taking meds keeps the arguments at bay then who gives a crap about who what and where. Obviously the idea is to create a happy healthy tax payer with minimum effort. I fought tooth and nail to be taken of meds and never won. I think now at least they know that I‚Äôm not the crazed lunatic drug smoker that they made me out to be.

174336604,The definition of insanity is getting kicked out of your apartment because you started pounding on your neighbor‚Äôs door. They‚Äôre going to take one look at your history and assume you‚Äôre an unstable schizophrenic who is harassing someone. Start recording the stuff he does to you. Show the recordings to your landlord. File an official complaint. Stay away from the neighbor.

175935075,Maybe there's a recipe for that juice in ecig forums. They have a lot of people who make their own.
175935076,I absolutely LOATHE small talk. I have to do it a lot. It‚Äôs always troublesome finding the right thing to say. Often I say the wrong things or am quiet at the wrong times. I think people think I am rude because I am bad with small talk. It makes me sad. I do not want to seem rude. I think I am bad with small talk because of social anxiety since mishaps most often happen with strangers or people I barely know. I wish as a society we could just drop the act of small talk. It causes more confusion than anything else.

175935080,"Remember that they are just delusions and may or may not be real. I personally have the delusion that I‚Äôm suffering for a good cause and will be rewarded with a normal life one day.

Especially with my parents acting like I‚Äôve done something terrible every time I eat more than like half a regular serving of food. I feel that they will become more insane than me if I ever get overweight. Idk why it‚Äôs important, not like I‚Äôll be dating anytime soon or anything."
175935081,I had serious problems for about 6 years. I never thought that I had a camera in me but I thought my house was bugged. I had good reason to believe that but that‚Äôs a whole other story. When I wasn‚Äôt in my house and was outside I thought satellites were watching me. It made me paranoid as hell. I didn‚Äôt talk then. I guess you could call it Alogia but I was literally afraid to talk. Even in my own house. I never would have posted anything on the Internet then. So you are already better than I was. You think you aren‚Äôt monitored here? I still have the delusions and still think I am being recorded but now I think it‚Äôs just with my cell phone. It has a microphone and a camera. That‚Äôs plausible. The difference now? I don‚Äôt care anymore. Let them watch and listen. As I already stated. It took about 6 years to get there. How long have you been sick? You post the same topic over and over again. What answer are you looking for? Nobody knows who you are here.

175935257,"_AT_MENTION_ I was in charge of hiring and managing a team of people at my last job. I really valued people who were able to be flexible, because I could trust them to get the work done by the deadline. Because they were working on their own schedule, they felt less stressed and produced better results. Some of them preferred to take most of their work home to do late at night, some people preferred to work during normal business hours. As long as they got all their tasks completed and produced high quality work, I had no problem with them taking breaks/logging hours whenever they wanted. This is obviously not appropriate for every environment, but for my team, it was awesome. Unfortunately, some managers go by what they can see, not by results. If they see employees taking breaks and goofing around, they scold them for not using time wisely. In reality, taking breaks helps keep people from getting burnt out and leads to longer employee retention and fewer sick days."

Stool spilled into everywhere internally. Just to save his life he had 5 surgeries within the first 72 hours of the procedure. Then his lungs collapsed at different times so he needed needles in his lungs a few times. When he left the hospital he had 6 INCHES of intestine left. The rest had to be removed. He was missing a smallish watermelon size chunk of his stomach. He had netting put in, taken iut, replaced a couple times. It was literally a gaping hole in his stomach. Took about 2 years for the grafts and mesh to take. His incisions would split open and he‚Äôd end up in the ER getting bags of fluid and blood from bleeding so much. Eventually he contracted 
MRSA. Took months to get a dx and he was literally almost dead when my husband decided to have him transferred to a bigger hospital. His pacemaker ended up being the source of the infection so he had surgery to remove it. Had a couple other minor surgeries because of the infection.

I'll spend my usual Friday afternoon and evening hanging out with my sister. We'll go out to dinner and then watch some episodes of The IT Crowd which is a British TV comedy series. I always enjoy these visits with her.
175935358,I think we as those who have been diagnosed with sz I think r especially prone to the negative effects of covid and all the isolation that‚Äôs required. I think we have to teach out for support. We don‚Äôt want to fight this battle alone. Take care guys!

I am trying to support him emotionally and sometimes financially through this, even though I, too, am stressed and having trouble (including sleeping). I urge you to find a voluntary therapist online for one-on-one counseling through this. I just got myself one of these sessions and it felt so good to get out of my head for the hour, hear both emotionally supportive words but also very practical advice that I immediately gave to my son. I'm worried about him every day. But I'm also worried about smothering him with resources and advice. I asked him if it was too much, and he said it wasn't. That I wasn't upsetting him. So, friends, reach out. No matter what. A 3 hour time difference is not insurmountable. Connect. Force yourselves to. And also, cut yourselves some slack. Focus on feeling better and not feeling the deficits of what you can't do right now. So brush your teeth at noon. Who cares? But do try something every day that connects you to friends, family
, mental health professionals, and nature. Take care."

Not sure if it's related to regular old exhaustion or if the buspar made me more tired. Although, if I woke up one day feeling good, energized, no achy joints and not tired, I would assume I was dead. I would definitely think... I feel too good, something must be wrong. Lol I kept trying to stop myself during my day, at work, to focus on how my brain felt. Did I feel anxiety, was my brain thinking of 20 random things at the same time, was agitated at all... Can't say I was. I tried to make my brain speed up and start going in circles and I couldn't. I couldn't self induce anxiety. Now, of course, was it the buspar, was it just being too tired to care, was it a placebo effect bc I consciously knew that buspar should be calming my brain? Idk and only time will tell. I appreciate all the encouragement! 12"

175935370,"Theres been a few moments this past couple of weeks, I've asked myself like ""why am I here?"". Like those few moments i dissociated. Not out of like mental illness, but like just now, for example, I'm watching tv and it went to commercial, and I'm back to reality and I feel like I shouldn't be here physically. Like sucked into a tv show and then back to reality. Like I should be with my dad at his house. Like I keep thinking idk this area or anyone here, I should be with my dad. It's hard to explain. Maybe it is part mental illness dissociation. Like an uncomfortable feeling of I shouldn't be here. I think its somewhat new to me that I'm on my own. Like I feel like I'm staying at a hotel and I need to go back home soon. Idk."

175935373,Mate. Not arguing that. I had a depressive break at 23. Psychotic at 29. It can happen. What I‚Äôm saying is that if your not on meds there‚Äôs issues there. Sure diagnosis changes but most folk around here don‚Äôt have the option of dropping meds. We become sick way too quickly. That is my only point. Multiepisodic‚Ä¶your usually in for life and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs those who are exceptions but in over 20 years and a few off I still stick by that.

175935376,In the interview he asked me if I‚Äôve ever delivered pizzas and I said awkwardly ‚ÄúYeah one night it didn‚Äôt work out. But it wasn‚Äôt anything I did but me and the manager didn‚Äôt have a good chemistry‚Äù. He looked at me confused and I said ‚Äúit was a long time ago‚Äù. And he kind of accepted it and hired me reluctantly a bit thinking I may have an attitude problem. When I had the first pizza delivery job I was 22 and the manager was 21 and a punk!!! So we clashed because I was having delusions. The vibe I get in my jobs restaurant now is much better. Nice guys in the kitchen. Some seem a bit irritated but they‚Äôre still way more chill than other food industry jobs I‚Äôve had so far. When the owner talked to me later he seemed very pleased with me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing good!! Do you like delivering pizzas??‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes!‚Äù And he said ok well here‚Äôs your schedule.
175935377,"_AT_MENTION_ I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to minimize or dismiss your diagnosis. A lot of people very close to me have BPD (including my boyfriend) and I know how important it is to have a correct diagnosis. I guess, just seeing it written down, about me, sort of threw me for a loop. Like, it feels sort of dismissive and invalidating of my experiences"

175935384,"IDK. I was technically useless for 8 months in the hospital. I was 21 and supposedly in the prime of life. But I paced the halls in a hospital gown; rarely talking; just kept to myself and also slept a lot. Took my medication dutifully every night and attended a few groups, took my turn picking up cigarette butts from the back lawn. When I got out I would say I became useful. I eventually started helping my family in any way I could. Was a decent friend, brother and son. So my uselessness was temporary. Things change. If one thing doesn‚Äôt work find another. Sometimes you got to invent ways to be useful for yourself. This probably won‚Äôt help, but it‚Äôs just a few ideas I had."

174336678,"https://healthitanalytics.com/news/new-imaging-analytics-method-may-boost-schizophrenia-treatment July 01, 2020 - An innovative imaging analytics method helped researchers categorize subgroups of schizophrenia patients using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, according to a study published in NeuroImage .The technique could enable researchers to identify key patterns in brain imaging for those with mental illness, and assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with mental illnesses that are difficult to identify. Additionally, the method could show medical practitioners whether the current treatments have or have not been working based on image groupings.Diagnosing and treating mental illness is an incredibly complex process, researchers noted. The same illness can present differently across patients, and there is usually no singular treatment that will be effective for all patients. Once a treatment is in place, its success can also vary from patient to patient."

A baseline survey on smoking behaviors including current smoking status and smoking cessation stage, was administered in 420 participants that were randomly extracted from a patient pool (n?=?680) in 2016, and a follow-up survey was administered in 2017. We calculated the distribution and change in smoking cessation stage, number of smokers and nonsmokers after 1?ye
ar, and quitting rate from a naturalistic 1-year smoking-cessation follow up.The number of baseline respondents was 350; 113 current smokers and 68 former smokers. Among the 113 current smokers, 104 (92.0%) were followed for 1?year, 79 (70.0%) were interested in smoking cessation, and only 7 had received smoking cessation treatments at baseline. Among the tracked 104 participants, only 6 (5.8%) stopped smoking after 1?year. Among the 25 participants who had intentions to quit smoking within 6?months at baseline, 6 (24.0%) maintained their intention to quit smoking for 1?year, and 16 (64.0%) did not maintain their intention to quit smoking.Our findings showed that many smokers with schizophrenia were interested in quitting smoking, but few patients received treatment and actually quit smoking. Timely intervention, including the option to receive smoking cessation treatment, is necessary for those patients with schizophrenia who smoke.UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN_PHONE_NO_, registered on August 31, 2016)

And why does it exist? We take our experience of being in the world for granted. But the very existence of consciousness raises profound questions: Why would any collection of matter in the universe be conscious? How are we able to think about this? And why should we? In this wonderfully accessible book, _NAME_ guides us through the evolving definitions, philosophies, and scientific findings that probe our limited understanding of consciousness. Where does it reside, and what gives rise to it? Could it be an illusion, or a universal property of all matter? As we try to understand consciousness, we must grapple with how to define it and, in the age of artificial intelligence, who or what might possess it. Conscious offers lively and challenging arguments that alter our ideas about consciousness‚Äîallowing us to think fre

175935519,"My only child started kindergarten this week. Locally we are doing a hybrid thing, 2 days in person school 3 days at home. I'm spiralling out of control with panic attacks. The change, the realization of him growing up, the looking into the future knowing I only have so many years left before he grows up and moves out. And those of you with panic attacks know the spiral is always deeper and deeper with more what if what if what if. I'm not handling the change well. I understand this is life, I have no control, I must accept it. I can say those things but I can't stop my brain from making it into a nuclear bomb of terror and chaos. Racing thoughts, hot, cold, sweating, goosebumps, that suddenly burning feeling starting in your stomach and the burn goes out through your body, pounding heart. You know the deal. My psychiatrist has me on 60 mg of Prozac _NAME_, I've been on Prozac for years. I take klonopin prn, my panic hasn't been this bad in awhile and I haven't taken 1 since 2012! Asked him for a r
efill the other day bc mine are so old, knowing that school was coming and knowing how I am, I wanted to be prepared. Instead he gave me buspar 5mg bid to add to the 60 mg Prozac. I hate changing meds. It's yet another phobia I have. I put it off and put it off. I don't even like taking the klonopin. I hate it so much. Last night was night 4 of no sleep. I decided to suck it up and start the buspar. Bc of my fears, I only took 1/4 of a tablet. Didn't sleep any better. Had anxiety. Got up with panic attack. Crying sobbing couldn't breath. Couldn't even do to work. I can't have this affecting my ability to work. Here's the questions, now that I've blurted my week of chaos out to you... Did that tiny dose of buspar escalate things? Should I just take an old klonopin, is it possible to be stuck in a panic cycle and need the benzo to break it? Has anyone taken buspar and Prozac at that high of a dose together? Dr mentioned buspar can be taken prn for anxious days instead of bid. But pharmacist said that isn't a co
mmon instruction bc it needs to build up to control anxiety. Prn is usually for headaches, in pharmacists opinion. If I take the buspar bid and Prozac _NAME_, is it still safe to take klonopin prn? Honestly the klonopin is like a security blanket for me. I need to know I have it even if I am not taking it. If anyone has any experience with that cocktail of meds, let me know how it is, please. I did CBT for years, spent $75 a week for years on the visits. The coping skills do not help me for panic, it helps w the day to day anxiety battle but not the full fledge I am going to die panic attacks once they set it. You would think eventually the body would be out of adrenaline to feed them and I could rest."

175935545,Everyday I‚Äôm a different. It changed my life . Today I was so full of life the happiest easiest to get along with talk to also helped with everything I could. Yesterday you couldn‚Äôt look at me without triggering me all my answers were short i would regret everything I said and upset everyone close to me. Yesterday you would hate to be around me . Today I‚Äôm the center of attention and you would gravitate towards me. It‚Äôs very confusing to one day have so much patience and compassion while next day be triggered so fast and have such a short temper. I literally can be So helpful or be so very Toxic everyday is different. While medicine helps me It doesn‚Äôt change how I make others feel .
175935546,"I am feeling well. Today I had to go slow and stretch the time, but it worked. In the past I might have gotten depressed, but not this time. Also, there are several things now to worry about, but I am trying to block worry when I see it coming. That is working for me. I read several of the posts here. I am not good at engaging in a dialog to help others. I admire several of you who can help people by asking questions and giving sound advice. There was a long time when I could not remember any names here. But now I remember several names and identifying info."

Failing to provide that results, again, in pragmatic self defeat: without a foothold of reality it makes no sense to speak of illusion. Opting out by saying this is provided by the reality of your experience (as opposed to its veridicality) has the distinction collapse, in which case worries are meaningless as well."

175935550,"Kinda long first (maybe?) post, dont remember. Hey there, i'm from the lyme forum,so not new to Healing Well(lots of posts), but seem to be cured of lyme after many years. That messes up your entire body. Many lymies have anx and dep which get better as the lyme gets better. You really end up learning way more about the entire body than you ever thought possible. It also causes autoimmune issues in some people (myself), so complete healthfullness might never be a part of ones life again. As a specialized ex pro level athlete in the past (I worked my way up and is wasn't a team sport, so not rich or famous !..LOL), this was/is especially hard on me and changed my future forever. But I am alive and can do some things (and recover) that I could not do without pain for quite sometime. Life is now, currently better and for the most part, worth getting out of bed........it wasnt before when ill for years. Now in my early 50's, I have already out lived some people in my life, so, yea, being above ground i
s good, but still not easy to deal with. Lingering autoimmune issues does still have an affect on my life and job choices, but less than the near past. That said, autoimmune seldom gets better...thus the name of it. Its managed at best. BUT.....This co$t a lot of time and money and of course, some life dreams. So I'm trying to make up for it and getting burned out in the process. I had to put many things off, never got a good career (many dont anymore anyway), home repairs added up ect. I have a hi-tech ""job"" and then I have self side job on the side which I like but have little time for. I try to live as simple as possible with a simple home / basic purchases, basic cars ect. but life and work still stress me out and I get more anxiety. I had no anxiety as a kid, I want that feeling again but feel its impossible as an adult with responsibilities like work and cost of living. When I competed, I was a vary fine tuned machine that could put everything aside and hone in on the prize, but thats what all good at
hletes can do. When not competing, most are regular people, human. My remaining anxiety comes down to To many bills, (and repair $urprizes), not enough time, and still some mysterious health issues. Health anxiety is hard to not think about . It comes down to stress. I feel like I stress over things I shouldn't- that are part of adult life. I seem to need more ""time out"" than most people, being introverted is part of that too. Probably not to rare (?). But if this is common, we as a society are not doing so well. I think my brain chemicals are pretty well balanced vs when it was out of wack from lyme. I did try...Zoloft? back then..made me a boring emotionaless zombie, my sense of humor was gone and I was not any better, prob cause of the lyme. Im pretty well versed in adrenal support health and adapogenic herbs that can make stress easier, but this seems never ending. If I won the lottery, I would live a simple life with work freedom, vs these people who spend it all and go to jail or die from all the part
yinging and huge purchases. . A year off of everything is prob what the Dr would order, but thats not possible. Taking a regular under two week vacation fixes nothing, as you come back home and go back to the daily grind. I know some people just sell everything and start over- but thats just taking a chance, not really a good one either.....seems like that is the same as running away. I like and aim for stability. Ive know people that dont do well with societies/lifes pressures, they dont fit in to well and either deal with it by alcohol or pot. Some drunks Ive known are now dead, and the stoners I knew, well, some are still stoned all the time, the others cleaned up there act 100%. Purposely ""Bluring"" reality is not a permanent solution for me, not going there, thats not how I do things. Guess if this site had a stress forum I'd post it there. Notice I didnt ask any direct questions on how to fix this, as I bet some here are worse, but yea, Id like to fix this for good. Ran out of ideas. So Im open to hear
ing some new ones. If the lottery had more winners, I'd try, but so would everyone else. Post Edited (astroman) : 9/7/2019 3:53:06 PM (GMT-6)"

We assessed gonadal hormones during the fasted state in drug-na√Øve patients with psychosis.Method: Fasting serum concentrations of follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, free-testosterone, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) and oestradiol (E2) were compared between a group of 55 newly diagnosed, drug-na√Øve, first-episode men with psychosis and a group of 55 healthy controls, matched for age, smoking status and BMI. Testosterone, free-testosterone and SHBG were compared between a group of 32 drug-na√Øve, first-episode females with psychosis and a group of 32 healthy 
controls matched for age, smoking status and BMI.Results: Testosterone and free-testosterone levels were significantly lower in the patients' group and SHBG levels significantly higher in the patients' group compared to those in healthy controls. The two female groups had similar values in the hormones which were measured.Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence of lower testosterone and free-testosterone levels and increased SHBG levels in drug-na√Øve, first-episode males with psychosis.KEY POINTSReduced testosterone and free-testosterone levels in drug-naive, first-episode males with psychosis.Increased SHBG levels in drug-naive first-episode males with psychosis.No difference in FSH, LH and E2 levels between drug-naive first episode males with psychosis and controls.No difference in testosterone, free-testosterone and SHBG levels between drug-naive, first-episode women with psychosis and controls."
175935595,"I‚Äôm a buzzkill here but I love sugar in my tea. Also love my carbs. My blood sugar is stable because I avoid fat. My tea uses skim milk. What causes high blood sugar isn‚Äôt so much the carbs as it is the saturated fat intake. The saturated fat blocks the glucose uptake pathways in the muscles and forms ‚Äúintermyocellular lipids‚Äù (intramuscular fat.) The more of that there is, the more insulin you will need to express to get the glucose past that. It‚Äôs the main cause of diet-related diabetes. Without that fat you could consume a lot of fat-free carbs and have a balanced blood sugar level. So, avoid saturated fat and avoid diabetes, effectively. The Dr. _PERSON_ diet is predicated on this. It can actually heal diabetes as well since the pancreas is given a chance to heal due to underutilization. But if you‚Äôre adamant on eating high fat meals then you‚Äôll need to cut sugar and carbs to balance blood sugar."

Still in my relationship with my boyfriend and that‚Äôs going on 8 months now, we‚Äôre as close as ever and he knows about all my various issues and is very supportive. My main issue lately is the massive rapid weight gain I have been experiencing from my IUD. I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life and have gained around 15 lbs in 2 months, with most of that weight gain being in this past month. (I‚Äôve literally been gaining a lb like every other day) I am endlessly hungry and it seems like I can‚Äôt control my cravings. Even when I was eating healthier than I ever did I was still gaining weight just slower. So I am getting it taken out sadly and getting a non hormonal one put in. I heard weight loss can be just as rapid after getting it taken out and I really hope that is the case bc when I gained 30 lbs on risperidon
e I was never able to lose it. I feel horrible about my body right now, extremely self conscious, worried for my health, nothing fits me and I had to shop for plus size swimsuits, etc. Horrible. My hair has also thinned out considerably because of all the hair loss the IUD has caused. Overall I just cant wait to get this thing out of me. Symptom wise I have been fine with pretty much nothing just occasional voices. That‚Äôs all folks!

174336730,"Well, to paraphrase _PERSON_: I would have rather been buried in Philadelphia. I was in some nice psyche wards and some not so nice. What every hospitalization had in common was they were boring. I was a loner in almost every hospital though a few people took an interest in me. Yeah, in some of them there was sex going on but I never got that lucky though. Surprisingly to me was there weren‚Äôt as many fights as I thought there would be. In the long term hospital people would lose control and the staff would either dog pile on the person or throw a net over them (seriously). Also in the same hospital a typical day would start out quiet but after breakfast the screaming, yelling and arguing would start and last continuously until dinner every day. To add to the racquet they had a janitor crew who would come in three or four days a week and strip the floors of wax and then lay down a new coat. Their machines were noisy. I remember in Stanford psyche ward they kept a 5 gallon container of ice cream in 
the freezer at all times that anyone could help themselves to at any time. It almost made having schizophrenia worth it. My favorite past times were sleeping (#1) and pacing. Every now and then I would deign to kick someone‚Äôs ass in ping-pong. I can‚Äôt say I enjoyed any of the hospitals, but whatcha goin‚Äô to do? I had no choice."

175935661,"My first and absolute rule when it comes to that is: ""never ever have children ever"". So... yeah, I can't contribute much on that. I think _PERSON_ got a lot of it decently covered though. I really agree from personal experience with this part in particular: It depends on how tired and irritable I am (which depends in large part on how well I've been sleeping, which in turn depends in large part on how stressed I've been lately, so it's a feedback loop). Sometimes, simply not being demanded any action or response by the people around me is enough. That's rare though. Usually, even the simple awareness of an appointment in the near future can be enough to ""break the immersion"". I hate having any pending things whatsoever to deal with that I can't just get over with as soon as I'm reminded of them. So I try to minimize those periods when I'll be aware of time-sensitive things that I can't get over with right away. It's better to squeeze as many of those time-sensitive things into a tiring but sho
rt period than to give myself weeks to be bothered by each of them. I instinctively tend to get more unrelated chores done that don't have a set timing the closer it gets to those time-specific things. That's good on one hand, but it can also easily drain me too much to deal with the time-specific thing that's been bothering me, which is really bad if I end up having to postpone it. So I try to be careful with that. When it comes to recurring things that aren't exactly time-specific but are still time-sensitive (like, say, grocery shopping), I try to turn them into consistent habits so they're moved from the ""conscious worry"" area of my mind to the ""automatic fact of life"" area. ""It's Tuesday, therefore XYZ"". I don't need to think about it, I just know it. One of the things that this applies to is my regular ""social interaction"" (namely: visiting my parents). My daily levels of stress have improved dramatically with these consistent habits since I moved to my current place a couple years ago. Rereadin
g what I said above, most of it doesn't really seem related to ""being alone"" at first glance, but I guess my sense of being alone really is tied to a sense of not having to worry about forcing thoughts and considerations into or out of my very limited mental focus. This is the point where I think SPD and ADHD can overlap quite a bit. I guess part of the above applies here. I guess part of the above applies again. Consistent, well-defined and clearly-stated habits and expectations (and consistent, well-defined and clearly-stated ways to introduce exceptions or change habits and expectations when necessary)."

I found stories about people being made stronger and better from every kind of human adversity except for people who have gone through a mental or emotional disturbance. The silence about such survivors is especially puzzling considering a statement made by the famous psychiatrist _NAME_ in 1963: Not infrequently we observe that a patient who is in a phase of recovery from what may have been a rather long illness shows continued improvement, past the point of his former ‚Äònormal‚Äô state of existence. He not only gets well, to use the vernacular; he gets as well as he was, and then continues to improve still further. He increases his productiv

He becomes, one might say, ‚Äúweller than well.‚Äù‚Ä¶every experienced psychiatrist has seen it‚Ä¶What could it mean?

175935717,"It appears that I have hit a wall in my spiritual and emotional wellness; something that is quite abstruse to me individually. At times, I feel a earning for a restitution of things as they once were, graceful and grotesque times both. Unequivocally, though, that restoration is not to take place because of my mental illnesses, which has rendered me to a place of desolate solitude, unable to climb up from the deep pit of despair. However nominal I feel like this moment will become in the future, it is imperative that I answer this question, what is there more to do to become a person who is liked and recieved favorably? I have intentionally avoided this question for the space of many years, even before schizophrenia. Why do I feel such a solemnity for this question? The answer I have tried to reach and hold for a duration of time has been gone from my sight. Previously, I thought that I was well-liked, but now that period of my book of life seems more and more distant. Though I sincerely try to be a
ltruistic and charitable to people, I often feel like that same positive emotion is not resent. I do wonder a lot, as I suppose a lot of introspective people do, what is there to do to become the person we are destined, or rather directed to be. But this question is of complete futility, because I know that I cannot answer it on my own. For instance, I set up a monthly donation to _USER_ID_ for the foreseeable future, to try to help people learn more about mental illness. But I feel this is not enough, and I‚Äôm not sure if it accounts for all of my transgressions to people and myself. I guess this is the age old question of wondering what is enough to truly repent, which in my definition, means change. Sorry for this being real long, but I wanted to improve upon my writing voice, so this is essentially practice but it is also candid and sincere. I feel like this is the one thing I can actually be mediocre at, so I wanted to improve. And this is the only way I know how, plus I‚Äôm not very good at fiction or

I‚Äôm worried I spoke angrily to a few customers at work yesterday, that my 2 colleagues noticed & that they‚Äôll tell on me & I‚Äôll get fired. Yesterday I had a series of extremely annoying, impatient and demanding customers. I was answering their inquiries and serving them at a normal pace, as quickly as anyone could. But from the way they were behaving you‚Äôd think the building was on fire. I was trying to help one of them and he just kept yabbering at me so I couldn‚Äôt actually concentrate enough to complete the computer task I needed to to serve him. His yabbering was just slowing me down. I finally gave him exactly what he wanted and he finally shut up & said, ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in kind of a surprised way, like he was surprised I‚Äôd been helping him all along & got him exactly what he‚Äôd asked for.

175935737,"en.wikipedia.org Ironic process theory Ironic process theory, ironic rebound, or the white bear problem refers to the psychological process whereby deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface. An example is how when someone is actively trying not to think of a white bear they may actually be more likely to imagine one. ""Try to pose for yourself this task: not to think of a polar bear, and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute."" ‚Äî _PERSON_, Winter Notes on Sum... Look there^ Somewhere along the way you‚Äôve been spooked (probably by synchronicity ((look here -->)) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity and the knowledge that Telepathy isn‚Äôt just a Star Trek thing) This has made you much more concerned with your thinking processes The brain is sort of like a computer we can accidentally hack. If I believe I have an open connection, and fear that connection may be compromised, I‚Äôd be apt to listen for and try and hold back 
anything coming to mind that may have been interjected by a nemesis. This causes stress on the mind and the mind will release that stress by forcing up whatever you‚Äôre trying to force down. While some synchromatic experiences may be genuine most, if not all, are accidental and non-targeted; but, as with Tourettes syndrome, we end up playing a game with ourselves accidentally and hacking our mind into a looping no-win process."

I never intended to go further away from Christ, I did all in my power to get closer to him and even to this day if it weren't for this disabling condition, I would be more a fervent follower than many pastors/bishops. I don't believe He left me, to this day in every breath I feel a supernatural spirit which gives me inward pleasure throughout my body (I will not explain it now). Rather I believe he brought this upon me for better or for worse. I have a little hope for Him and that is that I may see paradise in the afterlife. Regarding my current suffering, I do not see hope in guidance from above. I cannot tell if it is the Lord's will that I suffer and die or suffer and grow stronger. Regarding this, some personal experience is needed in order to understand why I say this. Which you may have. I may be a bit strong with my words considering this situation. But it is offensive to me when someone tells me Jesus is the answer. Not because I am anti-christian but because t
hat the idea presented by people is most times foolishness. Not that seeking Jesus is foolishness. If I had my emotions, I probably would have said something softer. But this is how I am. I hope that I didn't offend you. I have heard that my condition is a cold and blocked off heart or that it may be depersonalization or possibly depression.

175935840,_AT_MENTION_ glad to have you back! Welcome!
175935841,"IDK. Do they want you to move out? Do you want to move out? Do bears sh*t in the woods? Wait a minute, I digress. I lived in group homes. Living in those homes takes the pressure off of living with parents or roommates or by yourself. And if you get in the right one, you have few responsibilities‚Ä¶ That can be both good and bad. When I lived in one from 1990-95 It was a pretty simple way to live. I don‚Äôt know about your country and how the group homes are or even if you have them or if they are roughly the same as American ones. But the one I was in, the owners were a husband and wife. They hired a cleaning lady to come in on weekends and help the wife clean. They also did all the shopping and cooking and everybody in the house ate together. That was the only time we had to be all together, otherwise the rest of the time you could pretty much do what you want. Some people just stayed at home hanging out smoking or drinking soda. Others had some kind of daytime activity but it wasn‚Äôt required. 
I shared a room with one other guy, we had room for a few possessions and we just had to make our beds each morning and keep our few possessions neat. We didn‚Äôt have to do any cleaning though we did our own laundry on the premises on weekends. Violence was not tolerated. Supposedly either were drugs or drinking but I know some people were doing those. We could come and go as we please as long as we were home for meals but there was a curfew at night of 10:00 pm. It was flexible though because I was going to AA meetings almost every night and sometimes I got home after 10:00 pm but it was for a good reason so they allowed it. People had their own radios and even TV‚Äôs but the only entertainment the home provided was a TV with a VCR and a cabinet of some of the coolest movies on video. It was all guys so the owner had movies like Rambo, Dirty _NAME_, Total Recall, Top Gun, Predator etc. Idk, I lived there 5 years but the time passed quickly. I only made one friend the whole time but I wasn‚Äôt hated. I happe
n to be working and going to school and that meant I wasn‚Äôt part of the crowd who hung out together but they didn‚Äôt hassle me, they just let me alone and I let them alone. It‚Äôs cool, I can handle being a loner sometimes. The whole thing was OK, it wasn‚Äôt a bad experience. Oh yeah, the owners kept everybody‚Äôs medication and handed them out at 7:00 pm every night."
175935842,Yeah. That‚Äôs a real issue. I think a lot of people won‚Äôt support people with sz because they‚Äôre afraid of them. They believe we‚Äôre all grossly violent based on what they hear and see on tv.
175935843,Good question. When I lived by myself I used to eat dinner in front of the TV. Every night for a few months my symptoms would get really intense and every night I was right on the edge of feeling I needed to be hospitalized. It lasted a half hour to an hour. IDK why it stopped but now ten years later it rarely happens. I call those episodes. I don‚Äôt miss them by the way.

This was an overvalued idea because unlike the paranoid delusions you describe, I never thought there was anyone out there to get me, it was never personal, I wasn‚Äôt at the centre of anything. I was simply anxious about a realistic but grossly exaggerated threat. You might have OCD but I doubt that will explain your psychotic symptoms."

My dad never had a lot of money but at least twice he paid off several thousand dollars of my credit card debt with his own money. When he died I owed money and my dads life insurance took care of it. Just 4 years ago I ran up my credit cards to about seven thousand dollars. I never thought I would be able to pay them down but I did some balance transfers to cards with 0% interest on transfers and gave my credit cards to my sister to keep and got free groceries for years and I paid off the entire balance about two years ago. Now I don‚Äôt owe any money and have a couple thousand bucks in the bank. I thought credit cards were a necessity but now I learned I can get along fine without them.

And I carried this insecurity with me all the time I was growing up.

174336800,"This sounds similar to my experience. When I got ill with psychosis, I had insight in the beginning. As it got worse, over a period of 6 months, I gradually lost the ability to distinguish reality from my mind, as the new way of thinking took over. Years later I asked my psychiatrist about my insight, and she said it was common for people to question their experiences before the illness fully manifests itself. PTSD can definitely cause psychosis. Some people, who are chronically stressed, can become psychotic. It doesn't automatically mean a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Sometimes getting the right diagnosis takes time. - My illness lasted about 16 months. I don't have schizophrenia. It was just called first episode psychosis."

175935925,I have about had it with the dismissiveness of doctors and being sent on my way despite the chronic pain and issues I‚Äôve been having. I have lost a huge sense of normalcy due to whatever is going on with my health and this pandemic lockdown stuff.

175935929,Right! That‚Äôs a good tip.
175935930,I think it‚Äôs a good idea to have the injection every 3 weeks. Try to be honest about your paranoid thoughts towards your mom etc so they can help you and hopefully make it go away.

There‚Äôs no shame in having a fruit a few hours after having a meal, if that helps stabilize your bloodsugar and keep you from eating junk.

174336812,"Frankly, the current generation do not know the principle core of the change that has been occurred in the transmitters / receptors chemistry of any person with sz or the modulating factor The realistic true is that; There is no any change in the Natural transmitter or receptor at all !! The chemistry of transmitter / receptor in every person with sz is the same as any human being Without sz ,therefore there is no need to design any drug to target the natural transmitter / receptor (correct /modify /mute or inhibit ) to achieve final recovery from sz or its symptoms ! While the Spoken Transmitter which emitted from the hallucination is considered the abnormal material that must be treated only by inhibit /mute to achieve final recovery from Sz Keep in you mind that,the hallucination (emitter of the spoken transmitter) is not genetic nor a part from the psychological self ,it is independent existentially and it was created from the living energy and have no cellular structure or chemical or organic 
metabolism So that,you must design new medication to aiming a phonetic transmitter that be created by parasitic emitter who was created from the absolute living energy -that is to achieve final recovery"

175935938,"I really dont know what im talking about here, but i read the dsm 4 a couple months before my first episode. A while back i skimmed over parts of the dsm 5. I would say the dsm 5 is more clear. Going off memory, i remember not being diagnosed to that protocol, however i do know that a change has happened sometime in the last decade where doctors give out diagnosis‚Äôs sooner so that the individual can get on meds and have better support (including benefits if necessary). If a psychiatrist thinks you have schizoprenia or sza that can change with time. In the end it doesnt really matter if you have bipolar or sz or sza or aspergers or whatever, the thing that matters is that the medication helps. Psychiatry is still an infant and in 50 years with better technology/other factors perhaps sz/sza will be broken up into a few different illnesses/more specific labels. idk if this helps at all, im just going off memory of what ive read and what professionals have told me."

The standardized tests that tell you your in the 99th percentile of elementary progress, the trophies that everyone get, etc etc. It‚Äôs a pyramid though.

174336838,"Hey, I just wanted to ask other people with the disorder what they thought about the situation I‚Äôm in with my mum. Basically she was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few months ago when she was a carer for my _PERSON_, this job was really stressful and she started having hallucinations and hearing voices (which she was doing years ago when her sister died) Because of this I decided to contact social services and they took my _PERSON_ to a nursing home..it‚Äôs been a few months and the voices and hallucinations have apparently gone away, even though when my mum talks about them she states they were real and people next door who were agents of this man she‚Äôs been talking to since she was 9? I am really confused about this and I don‚Äôt understand what her brain is doing at all and if I question it she just gets mad saying that I don‚Äôt understand. A lot of the time she‚Äôs fine now, she‚Äôs got together her appearance and seems a lot happier however once a day she has 10 mins where she‚Äôll go on 
a rant talking to herself about how people aren‚Äôt to be trusted, for example today it was how her cousin had alternative motives than trying to help her. Another thing that‚Äôs weird is she thinks everything bad is caused by this man she‚Äôs been taking to since she was 9? My mum gets very angry at people trying to help her she responds with stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a child‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 50‚Äù etc The mental _NAME_ recovery team said are coming round every week but my mum doesn‚Äôt trust them and honestly seems quite scared of them, she says she thinks they have the wrong person etc. So I‚Äôm not sure what to do now ideally she‚Äôd need a therapist for the paranoia? She won‚Äôt talk to anyone who comes though and I‚Äôve been asked by the dr if I thought she needed to be hospitalised but I really don‚Äôt think that would be helpful as she‚Äôs not opening up herself. I‚Äôm at uni quite a lot of the time so I‚Äôm helping from there however I visit on weekends etc, I‚Äôm going to talk to her therapist again next w
eek but I doubt she‚Äôll talk to them soon. Any advice or insight?"

175936095,"The ‚ÄúGift‚Äù of perspective never caused anyone to become violent. I guess if the reality you were confronted with were ugly and miserable many would detach and become psychotic.

Many people believe they are rational, and actually they wouldn‚Äôt know the difference either. Think of it like this: if everyone believed the sky were blue and it was really green. That one person would have no idea. What if I was the only person who saw the sky for what it really was and everyone else just saw the same thing and thought it was schizophrenia? How do I know that I‚Äôm actually schizophrenic if I am only going on the basis of what it‚Äôs called at the surface? Many of my paranoid delusions at the beginning had some basis right? So what is unconscious mind hiding from me, that I don‚Äôt remember when I‚Äôm on anti-psychotic
s or medicated? Is this a type of programming or brainwashing that keeps me in this cycle of believing that I‚Äôm mentally ill to suppress a hidden reality or secret to do with the entire meaning of life? So it‚Äôs like the government steals your mind from you in order to suppress the very thing Jesus Christ died for. And JESUS was a pacifist, not a homicidal maniac."

175936167,"1. Forgetting meetings, deadlines, medications, medical appointments or other responsibilities can create problems at work and in your personal life, not to mention putting your health at risk. 2. For help, turn to computer programs and other electronic devices ( like your cell phone ) to remind you of appointments and deadlines. 3. For example, set your computer or smartphone to alert you five minutes before every event you have put on your calendar. NOTE: (Its easy to do if you need help figuring it out you can call your cell phone provider and their customer support people will talk you thru setting it up. Honestly it isn't hard to set up believe me.) NOTE: (If you need help setting up your computer to remind you just post your computers information and I will post the directions for you.) This WORKS!

Nobody believes me that negative symptoms are either created or made worse by Invega. Especially the low motivation is bad for me.
175936175,no i can‚Äôt tell when somebody is up to something. I find it really hard to read people. Can you tell?
175936176,"Like said above, planning seems helpful to me, either, even though it is not an extraordinary life. I thought in the past that living an organized and disciplined life was boring, but for whom has mental illness, I think making routines has benefits."
175936177,"Thanks. My boyfriend gets back in town next week, and I have a lot of work stuff going on so I am making sure to get all the school stuff done this weekend so I can have some time off."
175936178,Excellent advice. It‚Äôs hard though.
175936179,He raises an important point. One of my tendencies over the years was to intellectualize everything. Now that Im on medication I dont really do it anymore.
175936180,Let the depression set in now. And the loneliness.
175936181,Sorry about the scriptures. I can live with God bless us all.
175936182,"Even if it caused brain damage, brain damage is irreversible."
175936183,that‚Äôs for sure especially when you are faced with a choice which insurance is better
175936184,"Basically only the toxic losers had anything to say about it so it was a winning situation. Most people still talked to me and I still got invited to events and stuff from different people, so it really didn‚Äôt bother me at all."
175936185,Do you maybe want to be silenced instead? Then you can read posts and PM? I‚Äôll do whichever you want.
175936186,"It‚Äôs Saturday and I weighed 158.2 lbs. this am. That‚Äôs down 0.6 lbs. from last time I weighed myself. I haven‚Äôt been eating any cookies or dessert type items for the past four days and I haven‚Äôt been missing them. Next time I go grocery shopping, I‚Äôm not going to buy any sweets and see what happens to my weight as a result. I‚Äôm also going to try not eating when I am not hungry instead of eating to fulfill MyFitnessPal.com calorie requirements. I think doing that is keeping my weight up. I have a friend who doesn‚Äôt eat, when she‚Äôs not hungry, and she‚Äôs thin as a rail."
175936187,"Also, you need meds. Without those then the redirection is basically pointless because your entire sense of reason is off."
174336863,_PERSON_ I have a very supportive wife. She is the one who bailed me out. My dad has been helping me as much as he can financially. I just have had a very bad string of bad luck. I‚Äôm hoping my regular doctor can help me with my schizophrenia and I also have a therapist at a suboxone clinic we both go to every month that is very helpful. I just need some good luck! Ugh
175936188,Congratulations Ish what an excellent start
175936189,"Bro, Ghost Rider is sick as hell. Lol"
175936190,I only slept 4 hours a night on invega
175936191,I hated the state hospital violent patients throwing chairs nothing to do and they barely feed you
175936192,Not yet. I didn‚Äôt want to bother him. But I will
175936193,"Now sometimes I watch UFC, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, etc"
175936194,"It‚Äôs kind of instinct not to give up for me. I get a feeling that things will get better and also I feel like a fighter; I like to think that I‚Äôve been through the worst of it now, But in all honesty, I don‚Äôt know about all of this. Except for that I have a drive not to give up. If that will change, I don‚Äôt know."
175936195,Losing wait can be hard. It depends on the person. I‚Äôm not trying to discourage people. I think anybody can lose weight. I mean you just have to keep it off.
175936196,"I'm working on a master's, but want a Ph.D eventually."
175936197,I think so sometimes because I know they‚Äôre right and its for my own good to work. Its just that sometimes we fight verbally or with pushing.
175936198,I still am on meds.
175936199,"How many of you post on multiple forums? I am a prostate cancer survivor, and have posted there for 15 years, but am a relatively recent participant here, though I've been working through generalized anxiety issues for about 10 years now. I'm very happy with my progress."
174336862,Why do you say that schizophrenia cannot be cured if in scientific studies we can read that 25% of patients recover and is without drugs
175936200,So no a normal person can‚Äôt have genuine delusions
175936201,Is that something you can commit to?
175936202,I think you gotta find happyness in little things. Like i try to enjoy the little moments i have. I don‚Äôt really know to say how i‚Äôm happy with just this. But all I can say is that you can be happy even if you don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life
175936203,That isn‚Äôt really the case. Some seem to have some withdrawal but it‚Äôs a different system. It‚Äôs nothing like drug withdrawal and it‚Äôs something that depends on the person for sure. It‚Äôs not good saying they are addictive like in the opiod sense‚Ä¶
175936204,6 months I think?
175936205,"I live with my parents and I have disability benefits. I also live in Canada. When I applied, they wrote a letter to the disability agencies saying that I pay rent, then once I got approved they started charging me rent for real. It works out."
175936206,"I was on Zyprexa for about a year, started at 10mg and ended up at 20mg. Main side effect was that it made me really really drowsy. I‚Äôd sleep a solid 12 hours a night and about an hour after I took my Zyprexa I‚Äôd be out like a light. It also made me pretty hungry, gained a lot of weight. No extrapyramidal stuff, though. As for prolactin, as far as I know Zyprexa doesn‚Äôt cause prolactin levels to spike. Typical AP‚Äôs, Risperdal, and Invega all can do that, but not Zyprexa. Here‚Äôs a study that even says Zyprexa can decrease prolactin levels. Hope this helps."
175936207,Making cookies
175936208,"Omg, that‚Äôs so long. I‚Äôm sorry you have to suffer that long. I wish you could get in sooner. I‚Äôll pray for a cancellation."
175936209,I've watched some of those I feel like they're fake tho
175936210,"It‚Äôs a good drug but it stopped working for me unfortunately, I was on it for 5 years. Its great though, it has anti depressant properties too. My dosage was 80mg."
175936211,Med adjustment? Exercise?
175936212,"Oh ok, that makes sense."
175936213,It‚Äôs good you understand. Just remember: no one sets out to be an addict. But it could happen to the people you would least suspect.
174336858,I always retreat to my room. I try to sit with my dad in the living room sometimes but I start to get nervous. Schizophrenia really sucks. It ????? everything up
175936214,I was off work for about six years. I recently got a job about a month ago that a really like. It‚Äôs only two days a week so I can stay on disability. But it‚Äôs something to do.
175936215,No. I feel younger than my years. I was rarely in situations to grow via social interactions. Conversation is a creative source.
175936216,No. Alcohol is not the answer.
175936217,"I think on some level, you realize that you are just like the rest of us‚Ä¶a nobody. But you don‚Äôt want the roller coaster ride to end, so you keep up the facade that you are somehow famous. Perhaps it is more comforting for you to live in an altered state, than to have to face reality."
175936218,"I'm having an issue with my cat. She keeps taking my work keys. I doubt she knows they are for work, but regardless, they are keys and she keeps taking them. If I have them upstairs she takes them downstairs and vice versa. Doesnt matter where they are. She takes them. Almost like shes bringing them to me. Idk why she does that."

175936227,Check the papers you got with your meds or call the pharmacy.
174336860,It might work well as an add on but don‚Äôt expect it to lower prolactin levels. It has decent antidepressant properties which could in turn help with negative symptoms.
175936228,"Yes. I believe it‚Äôs just bubbly saliva. Nothing to worry about and almost certainly not related to psychosis. That being said, if you‚Äôre vomiting regularly you really need to talk to your doctor about it."
175936229,I have nightmares most nights. I hate going to sleep !!!
174336870,"Oh ok cool, wish I could do that more"

175936230,_PERSON_ just got a message from the Oculus app that a free event get together will happen today. The movie _NAME_ is free for juneteenth at the VR movie theatre with others. Also I think I will see parasyte in the VR movie theatre with everyone else too. It‚Äôs only 3.99 to get in. Maybe 4.99. Cheaper than the theatres in real life and it was an _NAME_ winner this year.

175936245,President _PERSON_ was evaluating the damage along the coast of the United States on some future date. He got on his computer and looked at the damage house by house. He then proceeded to tabulate the government‚Äôs secret logs of who voted for him and who didn‚Äôt. So Homeland Security wrote to those that voted against him and didn‚Äôt have insurance that due to Global Warming their house could not be kept on the coast any more. Supporters were assisted. Even emergency supplies were siphoned out that way. Those who had insurance were told they missed a payment if they voted wrong and others were given a check signed by the President. The President was so corrupt he soon was overthrown and replaced with the first Emperor of the US. A few centuries later Washington DC fell to Canada along with most of the north while Mexico took much of the south. A few states were ruled by a Emperor who kept the name the United States name in the central states. Later Lithuania took the whole thing.
175936246,"if you are referring to me, i‚Äôve been on it for just a few years, and latuda was a few years before that. although i was on risperidone briefly like eight years ago too. that was back when i was going on and off meds. eventually i determined i needed to be medicated."
175936247,"I never had this with my Risperidal injection, but I have heard it from someone else recently, too. Do you think you should try to shorten the interval between injections by, like, a few days or whatever?"
175936248,Could you try a different med or med combo? Wellbutrin helped when I was on Risperidone. It got me out of bed.
174336874,We have a few autistics on here. _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ have both Sz and autism. I used to work at a school for people who had both autism and schizophrenia.

175936255,"A lot of my recovery and being able to work is luck and being in the right place at the right time. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve worked hard most of the time and put in a lot off effort but I also got sick in an area with a lot of mental health services and housing and I took advantage of it. I don‚Äôt even know if other parts of the country have vocational programs but I was in two of them and they both helped me get jobs. I was lucky enough to be put in a real nice group home right after the hospital and it was a clean well kept house in a beautiful neighborhood in a beautiful upscale city. This environment really helped me."

175936260,Not at all. My AD works really well
175936261,"It's right, but it's partial. Others' pov is limited too. If you exchange the roles, would you say that you understand and know others better than they do? We all don't know the history of a person, the context where her ideas and way of being are born; we can see her mask and her appearance, probably better than she does, but we could mistake her mask for her real personality. We can't see her ‚Äúfrom inside‚Äù, as she does, or we can do it partially. We are less focused on others than they are, then our observation and memory, in their regard, are likely to be more superficial. Furthermore, confirmation bias is affecting our judgment of other people too. As we all are inter-related, how we perceive others has a consequence on our own self-image. It's schematic, however... less or more, ‚Äúnarcissists‚Äù need to underestimate people, ‚Äúthose who play the victim‚Äù need an evil person, ‚Äúthose who play the evil person‚Äù need a victim or a stupid person, ‚Äúinsecure people‚Äù need someone strong 
and able to protect them, and so on. We need to imagine others to be in a certain way, to strengthen our self-image and continue the ‚Äúsocial dance‚Äù. Finally, we can't have an entirely objective vision of ourselves, but others can lack objectivity or understanding too. That's why we need to listen to others, and consider their opinion, but it's a big mistake to exclude our own self-knowledge. Surely, if many people send us the same message, it's more likely to be true, but it could still be directed to our social mask. I think that there isn't a definitive answer. Disinterested observation would be the key, but we can often fail in it."

174336879,Me too. Without meds my mind works overtime. Mood swings and agitation and voices etc. On meds I‚Äôm calmer and clearer headed. I take minimum dose so not too foggy but I think my negative symptoms and depression is more my sza than the meds.

175936343,"MDPI Beyond Dopamine Receptor Antagonism: New Targets for Schizophrenia Treatment... Treatment of schizophrenia (SCZ) historically relies on the use of antipsychotic drugs to treat psychosis, with all of the currently available antipsychotics acting through the antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors. Although antipsychotics reduce... A very dense and long article but a good overview of how several of the medications in trial might normalize _USER_ID_ transmission and hippocampal hyperactivity. aberrant dopamine transmission and associated SCZ symptoms have been proposed as a consequence of disruption in afferent brain regions that regulate the dopamine system, mainly cortical and hippocampal regions. Hence, treatment at the site of pathology could be a more effective therapeutic avenue than current antipsychotics that target D2 receptors. For example, in the hippocampus a functional loss of PV interneurons has been associated with hippocampal hyperactivity that is proposed to underlie the hyperdopamin
ergic state observed in SCZ [54,55]. A hyperactive hippocampus can also interfere with the function of other circuits leading to cognitive deficits and negatives symptoms (Figure 1). Thus, targeting excitatory‚Äìinhibitory balance may alleviate positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of SCZ [54]. Therefore, one potential approach for treating a broad range of SCZ symptoms is to modulate abnormalities in glutamate and GABA neurotransmission, as will be discussed below. A further approach that could potentially normalize the functional loss of PV interneurons would be the modulation of Kv3.1 potassium channels on these cells. The Kv3.1 channel is part of the family of Kv3-type voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv3.1-Kv3.4) that have fast-spiking properties [74]. Kv3.1 channels are abundantly expressed in PV interneurons and play an important role in regulating their activity by allowing these cells to fire at high frequency and, thus, enabling the synchronized activity of pyramidal neurons and generation of 
gamma oscillations [75,76], which is dramatically impaired in SCZ [53]. Therefore, the modulation of these channels could potentially normalize the impaired activity of these interneurons in SCZ Another approach that could compensate for decreases in PV interneuron functionality is to increase GABA neurotransmission. One target that has shown some promise is the GABAA receptor containing the ?5 subtype (?5-GABAA) [81], which is highly expressed in limbic brain regions, mainly in the hippocampus and to a lesser extent in the neocortex [82,83,84]. A proposed function of ?5-GABAA receptors is the _USER_ID_ regulation of inhibitory inputs to pyramidal neurons, coordinating spike timing of these neurons and balancing excitation [85,86,87]. Of particular interest is the involvement of the ?5-GABAA receptor present on pyramidal neurons regulating GABA inputs arising from perisomatic targeting PV-expressing interneurons (Figure 2). Preclinical studies have supported the potential use of ?5-GABAA receptors positive al
losteric modulator (PAM) to treat SCZ. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how agonists of mAChR M4 could counteract a hyperdopaminergic state. The activation of mAChR M4 on cholinergic interneurons in the striatum reduces local cholinergic tone within the striatum, which reduces striatal dopamine levels [122,123]. Similar outcomes were found by Foster and colleagues, where the activation of mAChR M4 receptors on D1 receptor-spiny projection neurons may increase the release of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol that, through the activation of cannabinoid CB2 receptors located in presynaptic terminals of dopamine neurons, leads to sustained inhibition of dopamine release [124]. In addition, the activation of presynaptic mAChR M4 located in laterodorsal tegmental nuclei cholinergic neurons projecting to the VTA reduces local cholinergic tone, which may modulate dopamine neuron activity. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor activated by endogenous trace a
mines that are structurally related to monoaminergic neurotransmitters. The expression of TAAR1 was reported in several brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, striatum, _USER_ID_, nucleus accumbens, and ventral tegmental area [125]. It is proposed that the activation of TAAR1 modulates presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity [126], which may produce antipsychotic-like effects. Moreover, TAAR1 may alter D2 receptor-mediated signaling through the formation of heterodimers [127]. In mice, SEP-363856, a TAAR1 agonist developed by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, reduced dopamine synthesis capacity induced by repeated treatment with ketamine [128]. SEP-363856 was also found to inhibit neuronal firing and decrease excitability in the ventral tegmental area [129]. In addition to TAAR1, SEP-363856 also acts as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist [129]. Recent clinical trials have evaluated SEP-363856 for SCZ. In a phase-II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week, SEP-363856 was superior to placebo for reducing bot
h positive and negative symptoms of SCZ without inducing side effects of current antipsychotics [130]. Phase 3 clinical trials are ongoing. Clinical trials investigating the effects of ralmitaront (RO6889450), a TAAR1 partial agonist, in SCZ are also ongoing. They also suggest NAC and suforaphane as preventative treatments."

She was accused of gross betrayal of trust, involving a large sum of money lent to her by a friend....

This seems like a major breakthrough, even though I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll still require 15-20 years of study before we get something that helps people. Scientists at the _NAME_ Andel Research Institute (VARI) believe that a newly-identified epigenetic hotspot for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may give scientists a fresh path forward for devising more effective treatments and biomarker-based screening strategies. _PERSON_ and her collaborators found a cluster of epigenetic marks that ratchets up dopamine production while simultaneously scrambling the brain‚Äôs synapses. The result is a major shake-up of the brain‚Äôs organiza
tion and chemical balance that fuels symptoms of psychosis. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing is a one-two punch‚Äîthe brain is being flooded with too much dopamine and at the same time it is losing these critical neural connections,‚Äù _PERSON_ said. ‚ÄúLike many other neurological disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder often have early, or prodromal, phases that begin years before obvious symptoms. It is our hope that our findings may lead to new biomarkers to screen for risk, which would then allow for earlier intervention.‚Äù The team took a comprehensive look at DNA derived from brain cells of people with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and compared them to healthy controls. Their analyses revealed a cluster of epigenetic marks, which switch genes on and off, in an enhancer at a gene called IGF2, a critical regulator of synaptic development. Enhancers are stretches of DNA that help activate genes and can be major players in the development of diseases in the brain and other tissues. This enhancer al
so controls the activity of the nearby called tyrosine hydroxylase gene, which keeps dopamine in check. When the enhancer is epigenetically switched on, production of dopamine becomes dysregulated, resulting in too much of the chemical in the brain. Taken together, molecular changes at this site may explain why psychosis brought on by dopamine frequently is accompanied by a disruption of brain synapses, a devastating double-hit that promotes symptoms."

175936483,Either you are not in psychosis because of APs and your brain shrinks over time. Or you don‚Äôt take APs and delusional thought takes you down the rabbit hole where you lose contact w reality and thus cognitive function declines.

174336935,"I agree but the fact that they suppress their feelings so guardedly would suggest that even when their most powerful emotions rise to the surface, they're still tempered by that fear of exposing them. Sometimes I look at my strongest emotions like wild animals that must be kept caged and sedated or else they will run amok. People who are generally outwardly over emotional are the ones who are most likely to commit crimes of passion. Schizoids are more likely to keep theirs under lock and key. Maybe they filter them through introspection: I really want to stab this bitch in the face but if I do there will be some bad consequences that I don't care to deal with. My comment about some schizoids being stupid was poorly a rendered illustration of my point. There's bound to be a percentage of any group that's just stupid. I don't think being intelligent predisposes one to developing SPD. Still, suppressing emotions, even when it's advantageous is more or a defense mechanism than a genius move, I believe. 
Schizoid PD can be co-morbid with psychopathy, bipolar and, I believe schizophrenia. I still think someone who is schizoid with no other disorders is very unlikely to be murderously violent."

174336925,"Clozapine is a drug with unique properties, and for some people, it is the best and may be almost a godsend. That said, it is one of the most dangerous medications in clinical use, and also has a troublesome side-effect profile. For most people, the main problem with clozapine is not the lethal agranulocytosis, but (a) the disruption of the swallowing reflex, leading to nocturnal drooling and problems swallowing certain foods, (b) weight gain and associated metabolic disorders like diabetes, and ¬© unwanted sedation. Maybe I missed something? In other words, it‚Äôs the best drug for some people, but for the majority it is not. Alas, you don‚Äôt know in advance to which category you belong.

174336932,"Hey flor1231, I no longer take a single dose of any benzodiazepines and have been off of them for over 3 years (aside from any of the odd occasions they had been given under a doctors order during an operation procedure or emergency room visit which happened less than 5 times that I can remember). I was prescribed both clonazepam and lorazepam from a young age starting at age 12 and then started withdrawing slowly under doc supervision by age 20 due to physical dependence that was developed by addictive qualities of the drugs themselves. Valium (often describes as a weaker short acting version of the two above mentioned benzodiazepines- commonly heard of brand names in North America are Klonopin or Ativan; despite being several times more addictive and more likely to onset rebound panic attacks [which are much more severe than generalized anxiety attacks and consist of more physical symptoms not limited to shaking and breathing or swallowing difficulties but will have been accompanied by communicat
ion impairment/appearance of serious neurological sudden onset symptoms and deficits which are typically seen as serious enough to wind up in emergency room visits over the severity which can appear to an average person as someone suffering a heart attack or stroke, whilst they are in the sudden change of their normal state or calmer state which the drugs provide for a little bit of time being drastically different and shocking to provoke unnecessary hospitalization induced by half life descending in time when compared from the moment a patient with anxiety takes the drug till the time it wares off and is expunged from their system vs. A patient with panic disorder and the time it was ingested to the lesser time it feels psychologically helpful for despite being roughly the same amount of time biologically to be entirely removed all traces of the drug in the body being the same] The result of a generalization of anxiety or a complex/childhood trauma panic disorder technically shouldn't carry the drug less tim
e in the system from the time of release but for whatever reason, studies have been showing that the more severe trauma or anxiety disorder being a sudden onset during adulthood during episodes when the patients are doing dialectical or cognitive therapy, they are more likely to need increases in doses, stronger drugs with long release form instead of short release form versions being necessary on top of more frequently needing the drug to stop their severe anxiety or panic from completely taking over functionality of the patients every day life. The downside to this is the increased chance of addiction and physical dependence of these drugs which wind up costing more and more hospitalizations in psychiatric or addiction institutions, as well as debt to patients who can't afford treatment in the first place for if/when these side effects to needing more strong pharmaceuticals or more of the same pharmaceuticals until the inevitable tolerance build up happens when taking drugs intended only for short term trea
tment of no more than 2 weeks-2 months for long acting benzodiazepines and 5 days- 4 months for short acting benzodiazepines being the recommended prescription refill length for the increase in addiction and dependency rates doubling exceeding above and beyond those periods of prescription length where a patient will have a good chance of getting off the drug and staying off the drug with no trouble in comparison to someone who has been prescribed benzodiazepines in multiple various brands for long periods of time. Here is my non health and science and pharmaceuticals geek form of advice for you, coming from someone who has borderline personality traits and a genetic disease that causes psychiatric symptoms to appear during young adolescence which makes the disease that much more difficult to diagnose and which caused me more difficulty in diagnosis of psychiatric symptoms correlating to typical characteristics of any easy to treat once discovered psychiatric disease (I.e. schizophrenia or bipolar disorder is 
treated with only so many options of drugs whereas borderline personality disorder is not treatable with drugs and not diagnosed below the legal adult age as per country or province states that all children are not capable of displaying personality disorders and unless they are a danger to themselves or others they must remain treated as if they don't have any personality disorder because they are dependent on their parents and guardians to provide them with the tools they need for life and if it isn't anti social behaviour, the parents are better for making a difference than medication or hospitalization would, which is the truth in every case except for anti-social personality disorder for that becomes sociopaths or worse as adults and that can only be prevented with help and treatment from specialized treatment depending on a much deeper understanding of the role a parent(s) plays in a child's' life). All of that being said- I only got diagnosed with traits which is a much less serious diagnosed borderline 
personality disorder at the age of 25 and then that helped me understand why medication had never worked for me for if my case file were a lot less complicated, in terms of no query _NAME_ disease no query autism spectrum female adult with adhd no query major depressive disorder/panic disorder/bipolar disorder query mother diagnosed genetic factors at play/etc. Basically been ""query"" diagnosed with everything except for schizophrenia despite a famililial history of it, no matter what I got written down on paper by a doctor in the USA where I grew up, to now living in Canada and having been analyzed by a total of 5 different psychiatric specialists here, none of the words on paper will change childhood trauma and neglect, to addiction and work in the sex trade resulting from severe under treated panic and anxiety which stemmed from not just childhood but life long repeated attempts at fixing the problem within only to be victim and preyed on by violent abusers in my life despite being in constant trial and e
rror in times of ""doing what should be done to avoid more trauma piled up on top of old unresolved trauma despite years of treatment since new trauma kept layering to undo any positive change in lieu of the time spent in cbt or dbt or 12 step or self help reading and workbook activities being incorporated into my daily life without fail. It took me a long time to figure out how meds such as benzodiazepines were more harmful than helpful when it truly worked and stopped my manifestation of panic in public, although I still can't identify the cause of my panic when in the moment, it comes over me less and less as time goes on but unfortunately fairly severe and long time from start to finish when they do occur from time to time, but I'm sure it's a heck of a lot better than dealing with the fear of day to day embarrassing situations running away from friends and coworkers to hide and hyperventilate or pass out from black/white noise blurred vision and dizziness for a half hour spent in my car or in the bathroo
m only to wind up in an er being stuck for over 6 hours with no one to help me out because I'm not actually dying and in the odd case that I had heart rhythm irregularities and did actually have a reason to grey out and cause panic were only a result of not taking the meds on a regular basis when it said take as needed for anxiety on the bottle up to 3x daily as prescribed by the doctor not take 3x daily as per directions from doctor or anything else that would have said don't fail and miss a dose because you'll regret it when your meds ware off and you're working till 10 pm with no spare pills in your purse! I have at most one time a year where I have a long two hour outburst of sheer panic with disabling physical symptoms, but it's always onset by the same thing... prolonged period of strength and stability that has been shaken by someone or something that was said in public during a group therapy of sorts or group meditation wellness excercise which unfortunately tends to harm people from success in recove
ry methods used commonly for dialectical ""talk"" behaviour therapy in cases of bpd and asd or any other non common co-occurring disorder where thinking reality has been in question because reality is fact and not easily shaken when it comes to most mentally ill or addiction suffered combinations of diagnosed people seeking help with treatment of their disease. Medication solves only 30% of the problem for common mental health issues (schizophrenia not included as per medication is much more likely to cause worsening symptoms of the disease if not taken as prescribed whereas the ladder is less likely affected with vs without medication long term care facilities and treatment teams etc. Are all considered before meds in those other cases when schizophrenia is not a diagnosed concern) and the other 70% is all dependent on psychosomatic wellness (I.e. social, psychological and behavioural related causes which are playing into the symptoms; Often times a prescriber will consider these 3 external and internal valu
es and consider a need for therapeutical value as a higher priority and success rate when treating young adults and adolescents with early onset psychiatric symptoms for a long time before even turning to any form of a medication beyond anti depressants for <1 year trial runs for short term treatment in severe cases before they continue prescribing anything else because of the strength in numbers of patients who do well with their mental health disorder and sustain long term recovery solely resulting from a correct cocktail of counselling, social/outward support and multiple means of healthcare access in form of one on one talk therapy, group therapy and psychologist or psychiatric treatment all going into the factor of psychosomatic therapy over medication as a last resort of unfollowed instructions or incorrectly diagnosed mental health disorders which systematically result in the wrong treatment plan being developed based on what would be best for the common sufferers of that particular disorder gaining st
rength in lieu of treatment that is not generally recognized as effective for people with common traits of xyz personality disorder (which does not happen often making it that much more problematic when it does occur because once you get diagnosed with one or many other different disorders or labels within a psychiatric community, doctors are less and less likely to shed light or question the query of diagnosis or disorder that led you to their office chair in the first place and rather than get to know who is in their chair, the flaw of the community is they get to know the pieces of paper that other doctors' in treating you along the way have written down about you no matter how old or different it is from what they see, it is not etiquette to question a doctor that is senior to you, and a fresh perspective of a young fresh out of school student resident doctor is great if they aren't worried about following the shoes they are filling in for as the more important part of the process in treating the person a
ttached to the paper). This last sentence heavily applied to my systematic mistreatment and distrust in psychiatric treatment in both the us and Canada but it did not stop me from utilizing the good coping skills I developed even when the program was targeted to the audience without my diagnosis and although harmful to my psyche in the moment and countless panic attack during, and after occurred stemming from the start of each dbt wellness group session and private session and self led session tried, for its what people with trauma best success in coping and derailment of anxiety long term would have been a huge benefit for me had tailored to the person fitting my diagnosed problem, it still was a lot more help than I am currently getting and for which skills made sense to develop and incorporate into my regimen, I still to this day find them helpful, although not trying to induce anxiety is more important because it disrupted other people from getting the help they were cut out for, and ultimately learning t
o respect the difference in my mind and health is the only way I can get my life in order so for that terrible year and a half I spent forcing myself to revisit trauma with every means available to me, it would be worth every anxiety attack I suffered through as a result because I wouldn't be as able to make sense of my struggle, I wouldn't be able to accept medication into my body knowing that it's doing absolutely nothing but at least it shows how hard I'm trying and not discounting my doctors opinion as if I knew better so that in turn I earn trust with my care team overall the old ways I displayed my need to change meds every single time something stopped working and insisted control over that based on all the research and reviews I read on gray web sites that blurred my own opinions about knowing my true self if it was truly something working or something based off anxiety it might not work and then fulfilling my feelings of control and urges over avoiding anxiety becoming more important to me than getti
ng real help blocked my doctors from truly fulfilling their duty to all their patients which is do no harm unto others because as a vulnerable person, ultimately I blamed them for every time treatment didn't pan out the way they hoped it would but they were not doing anything wrong by treating me as well as they could had I done my part as a patient by being upfront and honest with my risk of addiction to medication as soon as it became apparent, rather than take advantage of it, had I been honest when drugs worked at lower doses rather than increase until it became my fault for how sick or ultimately suicidal it made me as a result winding up hospitalized every 2 weeks to 6 weeks between 12-14 and every 3months-5 months between ages 15-16 had the only way I could possibly wind up wise enough to contribute back to my community of suffering from mental health, trauma and abuse victims, and addictions members, then I would not regret anything about this experience I would still to this day totally sober and yet 
still down on luck say it sucked it sucked it absolutely sucked so bad but for every single time I've thought that, I would be greatly appreciative over every experience that seemed so wrong and not worth trying to get better over just because it gave me strength to share my story with scattered sounding messages and unclear structure of sentences which is worth way more to my wellness presently than any dose of benzodiazepines which flogged up every bad memory with enough fog to never remember again so long as I wasn't confronted to revisit it through therapy again was just the way I stayed safe when it wasn't helping me be a good person or be apart of society or change my personal behaviour which is what I'm trying to say is worth working on my life for everyday until I die if it means I don't have to suffer the same way I did last time the next time (g-d forbid that's the case) I suffer at the hand of someone else. Aside from that long spiel, hopefully this helps you see you're not alone, it happens to lot
s of people with a bad diagnosis for a doctor isn't trying to harm you by prescribing you something when they are doing the best they can with something a scientific test can't back up the basis for prescribing it in the first place as easily done with viruses or other common colds or ailments that get prescribed regularly. Psychiatric docs only have studied control groups and history of treatment/commonly identified symptoms reported by the people studying patients have reported over time. There is not text book that provides an exact answer for each case and it's a huge problem for docs and patients as a team to develop the right treatment through trial and error."

175936603,"Hi, I‚Äôve got a little bit of a confession. For the past 4 days I‚Äôve been getting headaches and feeling **** as I am withdrawing from 15mg of Zyprexa and 20mg of Lexapro. The reason for this is that I ordered a LSD tab off the dark net... never taken it before and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the right thing to do given my history with psychosis since 2013 but I dunno. I seem to be able to be happy for a while then I start to question my medication. I‚Äôve told my family that I am back to taking my medication... I just needed to tell some people about what My plan is..."
175936604,I don‚Äôt think my pdr will prescribe a stimulant med to prevent sleep. I guess I will stay with coffee and nicotine.

175936610,How to get them to take me to the ER? I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm dying
175936611,I take benzo‚Äôs because they help. Zyprexa helps with hallucinations and benzo‚Äôs help with paranoia and anxiety. I‚Äôve been addicted to a few substances but benzo withdraws are some of the worst. They‚Äôre as bad as cigarettes to me. They help with my illness but I hate how tired they make me. I was on 1 mg of Ativan 3 times a day but my anxiety was still horrible. My doctor just switched me to Valium which is stronger but it makes me too tired. I‚Äôm telling my doctor I want to go back to Ativan. I wish I didn‚Äôt need the stuff because I hate the withdraws but I also hate the anxiety too.
175936612,"For me, there‚Äôs lots of reasons. First of all, and most importantly, genetics. Almost every one in my family is MI with sz, sza, bipolar, psychotic depression, and neurotic depression, Then, very severe physical, mental and sexual abuse all my life. Then a lot of pot smoking throughout my life until my mid 40‚Äôs. Then, malnutrition in my teens and 20‚Äôs due to severe bulimia. My dx is sza, bipolar type."
174336951,"The use of statistics is not a problem, and there are scientific methods that don‚Äôt rely on statistics that are still used to study schizophrenia and other illnesses. To say that it has ‚Äúonly been verified statistically‚Äù shows a lack of understanding of the scientific method. Statistics are only there to show the likeliness that the particular effect shown under those particular circumstances it was shown in was entirely due to chance. It cannot ‚Äúverify‚Äù anything, only disconfirm it. Through repeated replication, that finding becomes likely, and repeated replication is the fundament of basically any claim you will read in a medical textbook that is presented with some certainty."
175936613,I had my first episode when I was 26. Been 10 years now.
175936614,I wish I had like a million dollars or more just for the purpose of donation. Not for living or my daily sustenance. Imagine changing people‚Äôs lives with that. I would gladly give out if I was a millionaire.

175936616,"_PERSON_ I wondered how it was going for you, and now I see that things are still bad. I could sit here for an hour and give you advice, and I will, but....first I need to hear that you are willing and are doing SOMETHING, in order to make change. You see my dear...20 people could get on here and give you advice on what to do, but if you are not actually doing something to protect yourself and the children, then it is useless. _PERSON_ has given you good advice, and you were given advice before.....have you and the children taken up refuge at a Woman's Shelter? If not...there is nothing we can do. Find the courage my dear.......we are praying for you. You are stronger than you think!"

175936618,Oh I‚Äôm sorry _AT_MENTION_ but give it some more time before you decide to throw in the towel.
174336950,"I play drums and since being on medication I am still enjoying playing. I started playing at sixteen with schizophrenic symptoms. Since when I think about it my mental illness started around age 13. I dont really now what its like to play without symptoms or medication. I play for 15 min to 30 min about 4 to 5 days a week. I could get into a zone and feel music better without medication, but the medication keeps me stable and able to enjoy other parts of life besides my hobbies."
175936619,I‚Äôm sorry they don‚Äôt understand mental illness but they are just uneducated. My Dad is quite ignorant on the subject (‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt be taking pills‚Äù) so I know a little of what it‚Äôs like. Unfortunately if they aren‚Äôt supportive the only thing you can do is to not seek their guidance. Because they will just tell you useless rubbish like its satan communicating with you and possibly confuse/upset you. Do you have anyone outside your immediate family that might be more useful? Like an Uncle or an Aunt? What about friends?
175936620,i think _AT_MENTION_ has the answer. cities are more serviced by mental health proffessionals and therefore discover more cases of mental illness.
175936621,I dont want to hurt anyone anymore
175936622,That‚Äôs comforting to hear. Thanks so much.
175936623,"For some reason, I have regret occasionally, but never anything I can call remorse. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say it is a manifestation of schizoid personality (I don‚Äôt feel it is a disorder any more, but it used to be). -A."

175936632,"I get it. I‚Äôm going through it in Florida, which is really weird because there were so many tourists and seasonal residents here just a week ago until they closed all the beaches and other attractions and restaurants. Now most have gone ( I hope). Since I‚Äôm self-isolating and not leaving the apartment, I feel like I‚Äôm so out of touch. I feel like I don‚Äôt even know what day or time it is. I am just living in the moment. I have plenty of things to keep me occupied ( books, TV, hobbies), but it‚Äôs really hard to motivate myself. I have no appetite, and have lost 5 lbs because I forget to eat or don‚Äôt eat enough. Yet really I‚Äôm ok. It helps to connect with others. It helps to even write it down. Keep in touch, and best wishes."

175936637,"Well, you may never recapture that life before schizophrenia. But I read several places that the prognosis for schizophrenia is better if you were well adjusted before you developed it. They say that if you were social and had friends and school or a job that the prognosis is better. Your case is pretty severe and you may not get your old life back. So you should maybe aim for something more realistic."

175936643,The haloperidol shortage was announced in October of 2018. Mylan has not produced since then. Other company Zydus makes 5 mg and larger that are in short supply. I was taking 1 mg. Have not been able to obtain haloperidol / Haldol since December 2018. Due to unavailability my provider switched me to Prolixin / fluphenazine 5 days ago.

174336954,I was admitted 2 weeks ago for 2 days. A highly intelligent polish doctor and I decided to raise my geodon with 40 mg and raise my seroquel with 100 mg. At the same she decided to lower my Clopixol depo from 400 mg every 2. week to every 3 week. I received the injection last week and I haven‚Äôt had positive symptoms during that period. My personal experience is that the 1. gen antipsychotics manage the positive symptoms well. But at the same time I think that especially seroquel manage the positive symptoms just as well without worsening the negative. My conclusion is that the 2. gen antipsychotics are much more gentle side effect wise. And that they don‚Äôt worsen the negative in the same degree as the 1. gen antipsychotics.

beach round a fire the first night i had by then decided i would stay away as long as no police caught me they let me have a beer and when i asked where they were staying i said i had 2 sons in a caravan park with an abusive husband he shouted and i‚Äôd just walked out then i begged all day got very hungry, stole a pickled egg i sat with some homeless people in a doorway and they let me smoke and drink a bit of what they had they went off, a guy came up and suggested i go with him and ‚Äòsmoke this‚Äô showed me a huge lump of hash we smoked in his car, he said that he had done this many times, driving 250 miles from L*** picking up girls and i thought we talked about how he kept them safe (what i thought) we kissed in the back but nothing much was happening so we stopped in the morning we went to the beach i don‚Äôt remember the morning or the time of day we went to the beach but i went swimming in my clothes then wore his while mine dried. i said is there any more hash? recovered memory he said no we smoked 
it all but i have been saving this for you. and gave me a spliff i do not know if this memory works with this but i have a vague memory of watching him pull away (it was light) then 12 hours later someone shook me awake. i was on the pavement it was past midnight and i was not in a doorway i was closer to the road than the side. i had no memory of the previous 12 hours it was the third night away i think but i checked mentally whether i had been raped‚Ä¶ my first thought was that i didn‚Äôt feel like i had been. that‚Äôs it i got in a cab i couldn‚Äôt pay for and got the police to take me home i remember giving them the name _NAME_ sorry, but i don‚Äôt know what happened I‚Äôd not been drinking at all it was not alcohol blackout"

I think that's how it works.. You're doing good though! No psychosis right?"

But other than those things, I feel mostly normal and my thinking is so much clearer and more normal that it is all worth it."
175936699,"How long ago did you last physically felt the opposite gender of whom you were interested in? For me, it‚Äôs been more than 15+ years since I physically felt the opposite gender of whom I had interest in. What I meant by physically felt is the holding of hands, the kiss of the lips, a hug, hell even sex. I am quite sure in psychology, biology and relationship studies that the physical touch and intimacy releases endorphins or hormones in the human body of both genders. The sight, scent and touch of that one particular person you are interested in brings peace of mind. What are the opinions of other schizophrenics on here?"
175936700,Wow Arabic that‚Äôs difficult!! It‚Äôs like a whole new arty alphabet. Nice one for having the motivation to do that

175936766,"Black liquid There‚Äôs this black liquid that is virtually undetectable, save a few people with the gift. It comes from computer screens, t.v. screens, phone screens, conversations and thoughts. Slowly, it builds from the feet while you are young. Then slowly, as time passes it, the black liquid begins to bubble up from various places. The black liquid enters through the eyes and ears and pools up in the body. Eventually you become infected with it and become able to transfer it to other people through words and touch. Once it reaches all the way to the brain, it just explodes the brains thinking patterns and leaves the person a husk of their former self.

Things I dislike: A group of boring people with boring jobs - and the only one who has anything interesting to say gets shut down for being boring the moment he starts to say something interesting.

175936820,"It has to do with the circadian rhythm.....we naturally get sleepy when it starts to get dark but most of us don‚Äôt see darkness in the same way we used to.....we have bright lights and screens that interfere with the circadian rhythm. The brain specifically responds to blue light for this rhythm. LEDs, cfls and lcd screens have a lot more blue light than an incandescent bulb and a book. Unfortunately it‚Äôs hard to get old style light bulbs and all screens have blue light. I use a three way light which is still the old style on the lowest setting in the bedroom. Normally we would get blue light from the sun only, older lights and candles are normally a softer light without blue peaks. A lot of people with bipolar are extraordinarily sensitive to blue light so theyve done studies with blue blockers, thus my advice. There are also special programs that shift out the blue on your screens to make everything look more orange.....can‚Äôt remember the name but google should help."

Plan is to over the next few months switch totally over to 10mg abilify. So far probably to early to tell if the abilify will do anything for libido or prolactin but hoping it will as personally would like to be on 1.5mg risperidone and 0.5 abilify.

174336996,"Fully awake and fully asleep. This is how normal people go through the 24 hrs. When they awake from sleep they slowly go to fully awake mode and this continues till reach sleep time and at that time they get intense urge to sleep, no longer able to remain awake etc and they fall to sleep and awake next morning with no awareness of how night gone. This is how I used to sleep and remain during day before I had negative symptoms. I found over the years especially when negative symptoms appeared this ability to rapidly shift from fully awake to fully sleep reducing. At night no urge to sleep and need to force myself to go to bed otherwise I remain awake till morning. Same way when awake from sleep need to force myself to get out of bed otherwise it continue till noon. My conclusion from my case is I am not fully awake during day and this why unable to multitask, remain alert etc and only certain part of the brain is awake and rest of it still in sleep mode. In dreams also normal people not multitask or 
have other thoughts during dreaming and the reason is brain not fully awake and this lack of fully awake even during day time is the reason for cognitive issues and negative symptoms. So in my opinion to improve cognition and negative symptoms we need to emulate to normal mode that is to remain fully awake during day time and remain fully asleep during night sleep time. During day time we can use stimulants like caffeine beverages or others to remain alert. Several substances are there which promote wakefulness both in prescription category and in supplement category. Similarly take substances which gives deep restful sleep at night. These also include several in prescription and supplement category."

174337022,"Hello. Being the only contact a foreign friend has in the medical community, she has asked me to provide advice on her sister‚Äôs prognosis. Being woefully unqualified, I am hopeful fellow panelists here can provide the guidance she is seeking. My friend‚Äôs sister, _PERSON_, is 30 years old and was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 13 years old. She has been taking medicine for around 17 years. Over the last 10 years, she has been relatively stable while medicated - able to study, do housework, and even work. The lone side effect of the medicine requires her to sleep for 10 hours. As shared above, _PERSON_ previously could act and manage herself normally on most days; however, when the seasons change like now (from autumn to winter), auditory hallucinations become much more prevalent and stronger - like her brain keeps working even while ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù despite having taken her medicine. I am unsure of the exact dosing, but _PERSON_ currently is taking 5 clozapine pills and 1 pill each of clonazepam, 
sodium valproate, and melatonin daily. To address the recently intensified auditory hallucinations, the doctor has advised to increase her clozapine to 6-7 pills/day. Questions: What other medicines are effective for auditory hallucinations, if any? How long can such medicines be taken safely and remain effective? 2‚Ä¶ Can yoga reduce ‚Äúthe sound in [_PERSON_‚Äôs] head‚Äù? What other activities could help in _PERSON_‚Äôs situation? Thank you, in advance, for your attention and suggestions. My friend is willing to correspond directly with any professional who can help her sister - providing more details than what I currently know."

I think they are telling you that they won‚Äôt let you use this site as a platform for international publication to discuss that belief. Personally, I have no problem with that. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been given a mission to use the internet for such publication. Some people think they have a mission to preach, but that can frequently be done on a smaller scale, through other avenues. Some agnostic or atheistic zealots seem to think they need to weed out any hint of belief, but I don‚Äôt think that is going to happen. They would need to kill too many of their own population on which they depend for their livelihood."

I don‚Äôt want to supplement with Testosterone because I‚Äôve heard that it is damaging to ones health. Testosterone supplementation can cause heart issues, blood clots, anger outbursts and prostate cancer among other things. My family doctor didn‚Äôt mention supplementation for me anyway. Now what?

175936989,I don‚Äôt see any reason why your doctor can‚Äôt put you on an anti-depressant.
175936990,"hi _AT_MENTION_ , my mother is a narcissistic sociopath who has always psychologically tortured me (Yes, that‚Äôs confirmed by my pdoc and no, it‚Äôs not a delusion or an exaggeration). So I certainly hear you on emotionally abusive mothers. It‚Äôs really nasty when they get to you. My psychotic symptoms still get triggered whenever I have contact with my mother. That‚Äôs awesome you had a successful recital, well done. You should be proud of yourself, don‚Äôt let her take that achievement away from you. A therapist once said to me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late for her, she‚Äôs beyond repair,‚Äù about my mother. I hope that may be of some support to you at the moment. It‚Äôs too late for her, she doesn‚Äôt have the emotional capacity to feel proud of & happy for you in your success because she‚Äôs so damaged & never did anything to heal. She instead sounds envious of your success. Focus on yourself instead & being well. What was the recital, do you play an instrument? I think you‚Äôre mega brave for getting 
up in front of an audience & performing, wow!"
175936991,How about chlamydia.
174337036,"People who, later, were diagnosed with psychosis had a higher degree of functional connectivity in this particular part of the brain. In addition, the researchers also found that patients who have already been diagnosed with schizophrenia have the same kind of hyperconnectivity pattern. It is present among schizophrenia patients but not in patients with other psychiatric disorders. Hope they will use this to faster identify drugs that work by looking for this pattern before and after administering a new med. Seems like a better plan than reporting subjective symptoms."
175936992,Very good! Impressive!
175936993,This audit I got at work has put me in a predicament. I had to give my supervisor all my tax returns and she asked me about receiving social security. So now they are all up in my business and asking questions. They made an adjustment to my SSDI and which part of it was taxable and say I owe another $3000. Employee tax compliance is a big deal working for the IRS. I am asking people for hundreds of thousands of dollars every day. I could lose my job over this.
174337030,"I have a similar experience except that my voices are evil. But just like yours they don‚Äôt want to be considered schizophrenia. All I have to do is pull out my bible, or post a prayer on a prayer site and they say evil things. My faith is the only thing that has kept me going. The medicine I take only put me to sleep."
174337033,I was doing ok on seroquel but not anymore. My understanding zyprexa is seroquels stronger big brother. Anyone get some control of their anxiety via zyprexa? How did it compare to clozapine?

174337035,"I‚Äôve always been self-interested and greedy and wanted money. I stopped for a while until I realized I could have nothing and rot or die on the streets. With todays current events and news, I am even more fearful. I used to want to be a multi-millionaire ; an investment banker, which for me, was a get rich quick scheme. I was a poor boy with no class or prestige. I was average or below average. I felt like I needed some money to get a woman and to matter or mean something. I am starting to feel that way again. I feel like wanting to be an ibanker caused my schizophrenia because of my greed and crap. I have terrible social skills and personality. It‚Äôs probably a good thing I was never one.

I am also new to this message board, and just wanted to respond to your posts and say hello and that I hope we can develop a nice community here. _NAME_, I am sorry to hear of your most recent experience, but am glad to hear of your residency in bouncing back. _PERSON_, I am also sorry to hear of your experience, but I hope you can see that you are of good use, and that I really hope we can all help each other out. My story isn‚Äôt particularly unique- I‚Äôve always struggled with self esteem issues, anxiety, depression, been to counseling, etc, like anyone else on these boards I‚Äôve had some very low times but also some really good times too. Lately everything of course has been flared up with this covid craziness. My gf of 6 years broke up with me today, because she wants me to seek help and feels like she was getting in the way. Deep down I know I‚Äôve been making her unhappy, even if she wouldn‚Äôt say it. I can‚Äôt blame her, she is doing very well for herself a
nd I‚Äôve been so low I don‚Äôt think she even recognizes me anymore. I am not on medication - previously tried lexapro but without major improvement..have tried klonopin previously which was very helpful but I‚Äôm worried to pursue this because I‚Äôm worried about the class of drug (I‚Äôve seen some individuals really struggle with negative effects), recently started medical marijuana which was had varied effects, sometimes it really helps, other times not so much... I just wanted to post to see what strategies you find are effective in alleviating your symptoms? I have been given counseling ‚Äúhomework‚Äù so many times in the past, and I admit to being a little lazy with it....two things my counselor once told me to do, that I tried today were: 1.) creating a big list of the things that give me anxiety/depression and creating a management plan 2.) creating a list of ‚Äúpositive qualities‚Äù about myself...I was told to do this years ago by my counselor, and I never did because it felt so impossible. I just 
could never seem to find anything positive about myself. But today I forced myself to do it. I felt so arrogant writing the list, and it wasn‚Äôt very long. But I really tried to force myself, not only to write the list, but also to shut down all the negative thoughts which tried to discredit all the things on the list. I never wanted to do those homework exercises because they always seemed so corny and just like they wouldn‚Äôt work...but I will say, they actually did help a little bit. It is very hard to cut off those negative thoughts tho, even after finishing the list....do you guys have any strategies which give you any relief? I hope my 2 can help...."

175937047,"That‚Äôs interesting. I wonder if l-theanine would work now considering the damage is already done for me with marijuana. Maybe it‚Äôs too late because I‚Äôve smoked cannabis heavy for 10 years straight with the odd breaks in between. L-theanine gives me horrid heartburn and makes my heart race. I wish I could enjoy it for the benefits. I used to only drink tea the first half of my life, but then I switched to coffee because tea was causing heartburn and stomach issues. I‚Äôll try the l- theanine again in smaller doses. And I‚Äôll have to quit marijuana, and use hemp cbd instead. I think marijuana had something to do with my ill health, but I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm using hemp cbd now with tiny amounts of thc and a good amount of cbd. Hemp naturally has a small amount of thc, and the cbd in hemp is supposedly neuro protective from thc. I wish I could handle l-theanine without stomach issues. I will try it in smaller amounts."

I try to convince myself that the thoughts I'm hearing in my head isn't me but it can get really difficult. These negative thoughts can turn into intrusive thoughts and it starts to affect my everyday lifestyle-- it's hard to concentrate on schoolwork, difficult to sleep through the night without waking up anxiously, etc. I also get really triggered at the smallest of things and I start to worry of what could happen.

175937133,The first time I ever heard voices or saw things was right after my mom died (I think or maybe it was when she got sick). Anyway. It was triggered by trauma. If you‚Äôve had any trauma in your life make sure to tell your doctor. My old psychiatrist told me that if you‚Äôre predisposed to any Mental Illness a traumatic experience can trigger that illness.

175937146,"So I can tell you exactly how it happens because I know people that have been approached and it‚Äôs always the same way. Generally it‚Äôs college students in language studies programs that are relevant. One was my high school‚Äôs Chinese teacher who was approached by a professor when she was in college. She turned down the offer. Sometimes journalists will get approached if they are doing work in a relevant country. If you are an active member of the military with outstanding marks in a relevant area, you might be approached. Every approach I‚Äôve heard of is an in-person approach by someone the potential recruit already knows. As others have mentioned, red flags would be mental illness, financial burdens, or any sort of thing that could be used as leverage, and yes they would typically run a basic background check before approach and then if a recruit is interested and says ‚Äúyes‚Äù they run a much more detailed look into that person and their associations. The CIA operates not much different fro
m any other organization except for the security clearance stuff and a bit more rigorous background checks. So if you applied and didn‚Äôt hear back, it‚Äôs as unlikely that they are conducting some secret operation to recruit you as the idea that any average company you applied to and didn‚Äôt hear back is doing the same thing. From all reports it‚Äôs a very bureaucratic place to work and the popular media glitz and glam is extremely far from the truth. There‚Äôs a reason the people that work in or around it colloquially refer to it as ‚Äúthe company.‚Äù So I guess in a sense they DO put subliminal messages out there to recruit people - it‚Äôs just not targeted to you specifically, but to everyone by encouraging films or shows about how exciting and awesome it would be to work there. Like most crappy places to work, ex-CIA people seem to have a great fondness for their coworkers but not so much for the institution itself."

175937216,"People don't understand me very often, though they do often know me well. There's a difference between knowing someone and truly understanding someone in my mind. Borderline personality disorder is a tough diagnosis. When it goes untreated the result is often very much what you're talking about. I've dated two people with the disorder and I've had and have friends that are diagnosed with it. It's a struggle for them and the people that are closest to them. That's the thing about personality disorders (and mental illness in general), it never just affects the person afflicted with it in isolation. I have diagnosed antisocial personality disorder, and while I sincerely do make an effort to avoid harming those closest to me, my condition still affects them and most definitely had an extremely adverse effect on anyone who knew me when I was younger and objectively out of control. You can't change who you fundamentally are, but you can choose how you play the cards you're dealt in life. No diagnosis has 
to dictate your choices or your life."

175937231,"First of all, understanding where the story began may give help to us. The Matrix Movies are based on esoteric and even philosophical \ religious ideas going back thousands of years ago into pre-history. Essentially, human beings, Homo Sapiens, have been on this planet, in relitivily the same anatomical state for at least 316,000 years according to all evidence from the fossil record. For at least 70,000 years of that history, human beings have left archeological and anthropological evidence of spiritual pursuits and rituals, having to do with life and death, the human condition, and understanding the cosmos and beyond. Additionally, there is evidence that other human civilizations have rose to power, maintained that position for a while, then went into decay and basically self destructed. Around 12,000 years ago, human beings after a well documented climatic event at the end of a climate cycle called the ‚ÄúYounger Dryas‚Äù started to build paleolithic structures, of which the earliest found (thus 
far) is located Gobli Tepi in modern day Turkey. These structures were built of stone and inscribed with in them are the symbols and beliefs and interactions of human culture with various consciousnesses, incarnated and discarnate, here and else where. These are indisputable facts and I am able to provide, in detail, evidence to these facts. As consciousnesses, incarnated in Homo Sapien bodies, seemingly we have no survivable intact memories of what came before our incarnation, or what our state of consciousness will be after the death of our bodies. I emphasis, ‚ÄòSeemingly‚Äô. Human beings have struggled with this dilemma for probably as long as we could be called homo sapiens, if not longer. Human beings have struggled to determine and extend the boundaries of inquiry, in a form of research and data collection, historically known as religion, modernly known as science. From the shamanistic, to classical forms of relgion and priesthood, into modern synchatic forms of New Age or New Thought, and into cutting 
edge physics. Along the way, one of the major pursuits, has revolved around fundamental questions, such as: Why is there suffering in the world? What is a ‚ÄòCorrect‚Äô view, a correct way to think about issues and situations, and what are correct actions we should take? These sorts of questions were most valiant in cultures surrounding and predating Zoroaster, Buddha, _NAME_, _NAME_, Socrates, Plato, ‚ÄòJesus‚Äô, _NAME_, and other such luminaries through the historical record (at least). They can also be found in seeming disparate places as the science fiction of _NAME_ and the horror novels and movies made from the works of _PERSON_, _NAME_ King, and in the fine arts of psychedelic artists such as _NAME_ Grey and _PERSON_ and all sorts of music, poems and dance, theater, film. The Matrix movies are relatively recent expression of a duality that human beings have psychically dealt with, probably since we first were forced out of the trees and onto the savanahs of Africa in climatic event, hundreds of thousan
ds of years ago. In any event, the Matrix movies are very Hollywood version of a very real philosophical and social dilemma of dualism. You will not find the answers in a movie. Only with awakened and enlightened perception and experience. Expect fierce resistance from people that you thought were your closest allies in life, those who would rather you be censored or be taken away than their world be upset or their power disrupted, but also expect guidance from those who have been maligned and rejected by the mainstream. The choice ultimately, is not the red (anti-psychotic) or blue (psychedelics) pill, or some sort of false dichotomy of that sort. Its a matter of the Heart and The Courage it takes to Live From It."

I‚Äôd post a link, but I‚Äôm too new to be allowed to do that. I did call the court administrator, and I started quizzing her as if I had a strictly medical excuse. She said that any diagnosis would not be made public, and the doctor didn‚Äôt even need to specify the illness, just the duration of the illness (temporary or permanent.) That was somewhat reassuring. I called my pdoc to get an excuse and specifically asked them not to put my diagnosis on the excuse letter, just a generic excuse. Hopefully that will do the trick."

Like everything else I'm constantly exposed to, they got in my head. There's no escaping that. Half of these people I wouldn't spit on if they were on fire. Yet I would have dreams about them. It sickened me. Same with some of the customers. I would sit at home and ruminate on how somebody could possibly be that much of an asshole.

175937325,I‚Äôm sorry to hear your going through so much. I hope the right combination is found for your depression. I was on Lithium; I hear it‚Äôs a good medication; a trustworthy one. I hope your pdoc is able to help you.
175937326,"Definitely. Attempting to pass as a ‚Äúnormie‚Äù can be exhausting, let alone completing the actual work one has to do. Sometimes it‚Äôs almost like trying to balance two jobs at once. Thank you _AT_MENTION_"

175937331,_AT_MENTION_ Thinking and sitting is good for me too as a daily exercise to find peace and process your thoughts and experiences. I went through the monk stage too- a contemplative monk.

Even if your parents were abusers, no parents in the world want to poison and kill their children. When its abuse, its rape and physical/verbal violence."
175937338,It does have side effects like most psych meds. You can do a simple google search‚Ä¶ What you need to know is if specific side effects continue through the course of your treatment or subside? Sometimes side effects can be prevalent early and subside after treatment. What is causing you problems? Others may know either way but it‚Äôs always something to talk to your doctor about before changing/stopping.

For me glycine containing supplements found to be useful. He too mentions about glycine reuptake inhibitor, n methyl glycine etc. I have tried both dimethyl glycine and trimethyl glycine and both found helpful. DMG or dimethyl glycine is a miracle supplement for negative symptoms without causing much side effects, its also good for workouts."
175937341,"Yes, I agree with the others! A morning routine, heck, maybe a whole day routine if possible. Like morning could be coffee and walk when the air is still fresh. I like to do mindfulness too, you could check out some YouTube videos on that if you‚Äôre interested. Take care."

175937431,"Yessss I have felt this way before, sometimes I feel like since they have power they use us and don‚Äôt care. One time I was at the hospital it was all OK and smiling with the staff and then all the sudden one of them was grabbing me under my arms and he looked really mad and I was very scared. They put me in seclusion and it was really scary. Threatened to give me shots but I thought I was already calm. I think it‚Äôs a mix of getting triggered by what‚Äôs happening and assumptions/ anxiety and it just all comes together in an explosion of fear and anger. And it can be troubling because the visions come back. Try to stop your thoughts as soon as they come, and replace them with more positive ones. The staff were probably worried as well and didn‚Äôt look happy. But most likely meant no harm. And anyone being strapped down is probably nor happy either so it is hard to think clearly in that situation . I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you, I wish the best ."

175937440,"kind of decent i was off anti depressants for a while now , but my family doctor looked at my patterns and told me that i would have tp get back to staloplam plus (Clonazepam (0.5mg) + Escitalopram Oxalate (10mg)). i was on his in 2018 to early 2019 and then had stopped My heart races at times but generally hopefuly calming down ...sudden incidents seem amplified i dunno difficult to explain an incident related to my daughter triggered it i guess"

175937446,"A guy on quora was saying that step 1 to getting over depression is to do what you want when you want. Something along the lines of ‚Äúif you want to sleep all day, or be a dick to someone, do that‚Äù. He said this is the most important step to getting over depression. Something about taking control of your life. Do you agree? Did you have a strategy to get over depression? Are ADs effective? How do they help you compared to without an AD?"

175937451,What symptoms do you have? How long did you stay on each antipsychotic to see if works? Did you experience any withdraw symptom by switching med? It is good to know that you finally find your right combo.

175937454,"I‚Äôm free from hallucinations after 6 years of sz. However, I have a fair amount of delusions but it might be because of my C-PTSD. Most of my delusions derive from my childhood years, such as me looking out for bullies or teachers. It‚Äôs mostly something I did to survive, but it just turned into something else."

174337137,It mostly depends on the individual. Atypical antipsychotics cause less side effects than typical antipsychotics. Do you know that your psy can prescribe you a med to remove the akathisia? I am on Latuda and have occasional akathisia.

I just want the voices to stop, the sz to stop, and to still be able to live my life. What do I mean by living my life?

I‚Äôve seen that first hand too. One of my favorite quotes is from _PERSON_, well the bastardized version of it is ‚Äúbe the change you wish to see in the world.‚Äù He really said it in a much deeper and thought provoking way, but we attribute that quote to him regardless. That quote has given me purpose. I finally know what I want in life, and that‚Äôs to advocate for people with mental illness. The change I want to see in the world is mental health _USER_ID_ be reduced. I‚Äôm going to do something about it. I don‚Äôt care of people think I‚Äôm a lunatic or make fun of me or put me in a straight jacket. I will stand up for those who cant stand up for themselves. What change would you like to see in the world? My point is, if you dont like the way something is then take action. It‚Äôs a hard road to walk, but if people didnt walk that road th

It might not seem like much, but to the homeless and poor, you‚Äôre keeping them alive. I have to disagree with your last paragraph. Kindness is not only for other people, it is so important to be kind to yourself. I‚Äôm slowly learning that. You cant tackle all the worlds problems, but you can tackle an issue that is super important to you. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through a rough time, I know you‚Äôve lost someone dear to you and it seems like people dont care how you feel, but I care. I honestly do, as do others on this site. You‚Äôre a good person and deserve love and compassion."
175937487,"So I have decided, again, to stay on my depot. It‚Äôs been two weeks off and I started having symptoms again. Enough to make me go, ‚Äúwhoa, not gonna do this again‚Äù . My pdoc pointed out that now is not the best time to come off, what with holiday stress. Also that the shot is a steady dose and pills can fluctuate depending o what you eat, depending nk, etc. He said thats why people on pills are in and out of the hospital compared to those on the shot. So- staying on for now and will try to combat my negatives somehow."

175937494,"I suffer from depression,high anxiety and insomnia and I just need people that understand what I am going through. I have people in my life that I talk to about this but it seems like they hear me but don't listen to what I say and it makes me disconnect from everyone days or even weeks at a time. I rarely sleep due to getting lost inside my head due to overthinking and playing scenarios out that make me question why I still keep going on. I do my best to keep active because as long as I keep my mind focused I don't get lost but some days are so bad that I just lay in bed and just stare at the ceiling in my room.I also have instances to where I loose time like I will be in my house one moment and blink just to be somewhere else with 2hrs unaccounted for, but these are just some of the things that honestly.. scare me the most."

But I also started hearing voices. They were all the people within 20 miles from me. At first it didn‚Äôtbother me. I just ignored and went with it. After I got diagnosed and found out couldnt have kids no more. I was still okay I was just happy to be alive. And all the voices stopped. Or if I did hearthem they told me how amazing I was. They the radiation screwed my kidneys and bladder up and about 3 1/2 months after my recovery I started peeing my pants and got put on opiates and drs completely forgot about me. Now I‚Äôm a recovering heroin stick and putting me on 100 mg of morphine is just gona make me depressed. Which it did. I had isolated my self on my room and cut the whole world out. I eventually took myself off the pills and it took me 3 years to find a dr to fix me cuz I was still peeing my pants. Now the voices never went aw
ay I thought it was from the cancer or mayb drugs. But it never goes away. I feel like the wholeworld is against me or losing to my face. But then they always wanna talk in our heads but it‚Äôs never in my head its through everything I hear through water,fans,tv, anything even cars. For a while they made fun of me cuz I am a little weird but so what. Not it came to the point where I think everyone is living still. And _PERSON_ up bad stuff about my self just to see if someone would hear and talk to me that Iwasnt crazy. I some how say disgusting ???? and its all lies.

But when the voices tell me I‚Äôm disgusting or yell at me to 
shut up. I‚Äôm saying everyone in my life is stupid and I hate them. Which I do not!! I was never like this I‚Äôm afraid to be myself cuz I‚Äômafraid ppl will call me fake or laugh at me and my boyfriend is a little stereotypical. And it made me confused like judging myself with what I wear or do or music I listen to. Its had me stuck in my house all summer not painting or really caring for my garden. My one dr. Diagnosed me with ptsd depression and OCD. Now I‚Äôm super ocd. My closet is color organized and shirt organized. I keep all my stuff in plastic bags. I‚Äôm so screwed up cuz I‚Äôm constantly saying bad stuff thatisn‚Äôt true. And i swear ppl in this community can hear each other. I dont like it. I‚Äôve put a wall up that‚Äôs gross and eewy.

But I feel like I‚Äômfading away. Stuck with negative voices reminding me of stuff so I make 
new stories up so the voices will stop. I really wanna stop saying I‚Äôm doingshit that I‚Äôm not. It makes me cry. And the meds I‚Äôm on are just making me think more and more that they are real. I am confused. My past does not bother me one bit I‚Äôm proud ofwho I am. I see my self repeating aword or a sentance that other ppl say. Like this but that lives downthe road. And another thing I dont really have friends that I talk toevery day. Everytime I get close I say mean things in myhead cause I think everyone‚Äôs lying to me and laughing at me. I‚Äôm am hypacondriac as well and I watch TV or read something and i think i got it from the tv??? Weirdright. I am a very spiritual and holy person. I‚Äôm trying to be myself and ppl laugh at me. I‚Äôm abeliever in stuff i believe that I‚Äôm a special person cause I‚Äôve had visions of past lifestylesand dreams that were so holy. And me thinking the world heard me is making me crazy. So I apologize every day for theshit my head says. Andsays the only truth comes out

174337149,I haven‚Äôt posted in awhile and missed this forum so here I go. I got diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. And last week he did. Swab sample to check my DNA and now I‚Äôm freaking out because now this place called Genesight has my dna and I‚Äôm scared of what they will do with it The pdoc says it‚Äôs to find out which meds will work best for me. But I think I got suckered in on a new project that the government is conducting to control me I can‚Äôt believe I consented to that! I politely told him I didn‚Äôt have schizophrenia that it was a made up word to make me lose all credibility. That I believe it‚Äôs a code word to alert the people involved in this experiment. Needless to say I got nowhere with that. I applied for ssdi in May and got. Letter from them sAying they are sending me to their psychiatrist and to. Medical dr in September. And I‚Äôm freaked out about that too Said the psychiatrist visit may take 3 hours And I‚Äôm like why in the hell would that take 3 hours? And how can the
y provide a diagnosis in a one time 3 hour visit? But I‚Äôm scared the most that if I‚Äôm honest they will send me away. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore it‚Äôs like all this sh it is out of my control 100%. Then he up‚Äôd my seroquel to 700mg after I explicitly told him I was doing fine on 500mg I don‚Äôt think my body can tolerate that much I feel like I‚Äôm passing out sitting down. I‚Äôm getting way sick and tired of being their lab monkey on meds. I just feel like it‚Äôs all coming to a head and I‚Äôm going to throw magnificent ranting raving fit. Sorry for the rambling but you all are the ones I trust and can understand where I‚Äôm coming from. I say anything negative at the pdoc I get my meds increased.

What I do is work, and like the last couple of months when I have had some down time to sort out some mental health issues, they‚Äôre supporting me to do that. The system is setup by Tories, so naturally, it‚Äôs designed to shoehorn people back into work. Applying for jobs isn‚Äôt going to cause a problem I was told that the work capability element if you get that can be reviewed at the request of a work coach at the job centre.

I am so upset we have not done so much more than we have done so far. Makes me illand that is putting it mildly. For some reason the older I get more injustice gets on my last nerve. People value the wrong things in life. For me other than God there is nothing more important than family.

174337177,"I was just inspired to write this when reading the wikipedia article for _NAME_. As far as the jobs I worked I started work when I was 14 at my girlfriends request we got jobs at a local water park. I was a dishwasher in a fast food restaraunt. I worked most of the summer but when my girlfriend got caught stealing funds from the cotton candy tent and was fired I quit. Money didn‚Äôt mean much to me even then. My next job was at a bookstore cafe and I worked for a few weeks before quitting. The money wasn‚Äôt enough of an incentive to work and my attention span wasn‚Äôt up to it. Then I got a job as a dishwasher at a seafood restaraunt and worked a few months until quitting. Again having money in my pocket wasn‚Äôt enough of an incentive to work. I quit when they called me in on a day I was on ecstacy. I think the longest I worked in all my teens was three months. I wasn‚Äôt inspired at all by the work anywhere. I had friends who would put gas in my tank and all I needed was the money for a pack of 
cigarettes, spare change back then. I worked at a drug store in the mall for seven months but quit when they wouldn‚Äôt give me the day off to go to a concert. My girlfriend said she would go with another guy if I didn‚Äôt go so I quit. When I was 21 I qualified for disability with my diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. I worked cleaning my dad‚Äôs office for a while and then got a job cleaning for the power company but it was six nights a week and I burnt out. Then when I was 24 I went to stay at a therapeutic farm community for people with mental illnesses. They didn‚Äôt pay you to work you just did and our families were paying for our stay there. I started on their forestry and grounds crew and worked cutting fire wood and harvesting maple sap for maple syrup. Then I worked on their garden crew growing crops for the kitchen. Everyone lived on the farm even the staff. They had a community dining hall where the food was great. I lived in a house called Mckee with other guys. There was a sauna house and a 
swimming hole that we built a huge dam across with rocks. I used to go snowshoeing at night with a headlamp once bringing a date. I then worked on their farm crew where I was the most interested I took care of cows and pigs, milked cows, learned to weld and fix machinery. I loved it. I worked hard and also did carpentry work. This is the hardest I‚Äôve ever worked and they weren‚Äôt even paying me to do it. I think that maybe the comraderie of the communal nature of the place was behind my liking the work. There was little to none of the preasure or criticism that comes with paid work. If I could live there the rest of my life I would. My friend Mark went back to college and got a job as the farming assasitant and does live there now. I envy him. There was never the loneliness or alienation I feel in my current suburban surroundings living with family in a place where I have few friends. I don‚Äôt know. I haven‚Äôt worked in years and the work I was doing I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with. The mental health wo
rkers who come to my house every week ask occasionally if I want to look for work but I always say sometime later. I would rather volunteer. I miss that community of people. There were probably nearly 40 of us in our 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs. Always something to do and someone to hang out with. There was a music shack where I could get together and jam with other musicians. I miss the community there was there. Loved it. I just recently ordered the book anarchism by _PERSON_ and think that if we lived in an anarcho-syndiclalist society that things would be similar to what they were at this community minus the psychiatrist and therapist you had to see which would be awesome. I think I‚Äôd feel more motivated and connected. However I am not an anarchist I am a democrat but I‚Äôve been interested in anarchism lately and also listening to alot of old punk rock and it‚Äôs been influencing me. I wish I was young again."

174337178,"First of all, I don‚Äôt mean any side effects from medications. I have been tortured by my condition. There was a period when I was in the hospital during which I was subject to what I‚Äôd call intelligent torture. I felt a REALLY BAD and STRONG feeling in my body (seemingly physical, worse than pain), which is like burning pain and restlessness combined. It would pretty much only ease up during walking , eating , sleeping , going to the toilet , talking to the doctor or nurse or being in the line to get my medications , and so I spent most of the days in the hospital walking in the corridor all day long. I call it intelligent because my Schizophrenia was intelligent enough to recognize those specific actions I wrote in bold, and when I‚Äôm doing those things - and then it would remove the torture. Over time it increased the amount of torture it applied, even during walking. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that torture upon anyone, and the voices and fake thoughts keep telling me I‚Äôm going to be tortured forev
er, more than I‚Äôve ever been tortured before, after I die. Those voices simply call it torture (in plural, in my language) and they told I was to be tortured unless I‚Äôm walking, or on some important business. I don‚Äôt know what was the purpose of having me walking all the time. While I‚Äôm not being tortured to the extent I was before (it was worse than pain), it can still inflict aches in my head, sometimes quite strong like a toothache, and there are pretty much all the time (although they, too, disappear when doing certain things) some unpleasant feelings I feel in my head or body. The voices have told the purpose of this is to calibrate my soul to reincarnate in a place where I‚Äôm going to be tortured forever. In the past 3 days this feeling of torture has returned, fortunately only for brief moments - apparently my Schizophrenia now wants my left leg to move every now and then before going to sleep, because that‚Äôs exactly the time when it‚Äôs doing it. It applies the feeling, and when my left leg 
moves it goes away. Then it keeps repeating it for a while."

175937644,Trying to keep busy today. I called my dad and he‚Äôs been drinking and it makes me really sad and anxious. He was supposed to come over today. I was gonna give my old tv to him but I decided to keep it and he decided he will just stay home and catch up on sleep from being at work so much. So I‚Äôm trying to stay busy and just idk... Doing lots of things and I won‚Äôt get everything done but it‚Äôs ok. Not even doing the most important stuff. I should be washing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen. But I‚Äôm cleaning up fianc√©‚Äôs old computer to give to his 19 yr old nephew. And maybe start to record another spoken word poetry album since I got my adapter in the mail to connect my mic to my laptop. And I got groceries today and put those up. Started making fianc√©‚Äôs lunches for work a few days ago. Gotta make dinner later and clean. Bought a peice of furniture for the living room too. Lots more stuff I need to get done. Trying to practice not overwhelming myself too with things to do cuz then I 
just feel like I don‚Äôt wanna do anything at all.

175937649,_AT_MENTION_ - It was a slow process but one day my mind just cleared up and it was as if I was able to think normally again. I realized I was trapped in my own thinking and the delusions were not real because my mind was not processing information normally. I was very disconnected from reality and very far gone the thoughts that I was having were not normal because I was having delusions of grandeur delusions of persecution and having odd and other beliefs that we‚Äôre not real. I was able to question my delusions because they were not real and the things that I was believing were so far out that they were not even making any sense that‚Äôs how I was able to question and realize that they were all delusions. Once my mind started to clear up that‚Äôs when I realized that I was very delusional and nothing was making sense as well the medication kicked in after about a month and the thoughts started to clear away is when I realize that I was delusional and I was not in the right state of mind and I wa
s a danger to myself and others. It all clicked in one day. Even though it was a slow process it all just happened in one day.

175937657,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6914250/ (elon musks new brainchild, pun intended) Neuralink is an investigational closed loop neurofeedback based modulator. It tracks and records then modulates action potential. it is robotically implanted into the cerebellum (or any other lobe like the temporal or occidental type forebrain regions) in under 30 minutes. It is a closed loop Artificially intelligent electrode array that consists of thousands of fiber optic cables implanted into the space between neurons. these threads are less than 1/100 the size of a human hair. The potential applications could be used for any central or peripheral nervous system disorder in theory. As the implant cant track and record a controls or your own efficient and stable action potentials that facilitate cognition and sentience and mood. For instance modulating neuronal activity in say the striatal or metcacortical regions or the frontal lobe with the assitance of action potential assisted modulation could in e
ssence use downstream neurotransmitter releases to completely stabilize endogenous monaminergic and glutamatergic pathways and serotonin pathways as well. In short it could alter and stabilize any neurotransmitter system in real time due to the closed loop AI aspects. Also the implant is removeable as the actual ‚Äúchip‚Äù is akin to a magnetic bluetooth device similar to the one Niander _NAME_ utilizes in blade runner 2049. Lastly there are also other brain machine interfaces in development .DARPAs RAM initiative (restoring active memory, already human trials and a tentative increase in 15% working memory capacity in epileptic patients with pre-existing deep brain implants for refractory seizure amelioration) and a mysterious one known as KERNEL (non invasive one) Kernel: Neuroscience as a Service (NaaS) Kernel: Neuroscience as a Service (NaaS) Kernel's Neuroscience as a Service (NaaS) gives you on-demand access to our world leading brain recording technology. neuralink.com Neuralink Developing ultra high ba

I'm just curious, what medicines were you taking before and what effects were they having? Also curious, my mother's mother had bipolar and that's probably where I got it from. Do you think you had a relative who had that? We are fortunate to live in an era when there are so many medicines available for emotional problems. My mother's mother had bipolar when there was basically no medicine for psychiatric problems. She spent a lot of her time in a mental hospital 100 miles from her home, again, with no effective medicines. With the medicines today, we can be treated in our homes. It wasn't always like that. Can you imagine what it would be like to go withou

175937808,"In my opinion I think it is possible to recover and no longer need meds IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS of mental illness. For example with psychosis, if the psychosis was drug induced. If the person gets clean before damaging their brain beyond repair, I think you can save yourself from a lifetime of meds and hospitalizations that way. I think that if you have had psychosis your whole life or for many many years that it may perhaps decrease in severity as you age but I don‚Äôt think its possible for it to just go away. You may create an environment for yourself in which there are minimal triggers or be in a certain good spot in life where there are minimal triggers. Idk these are just my thoughts. Like for me I really don‚Äôt think I will ever be able to go off meds. But even when I was off meds I did have good periods of time-sometimes even months at a time-where my symptoms were minimal and I thought I no longer had issues. Then life would get stressful again and I‚Äôd be back to square one."
174337213,"_AT_MENTION_ For me it‚Äôs not cigs, but my belief in God and religion. They forced me to become Christian out of fear. I used to be an atheist. They (aliens and others) have forced me to believe in Jesus out of trauma and fear. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to revert back to atheism or agnosticism. In my past lives, I was tortured by aliens and it was nasty and I won‚Äôt say or talk about it ‚Äì I tend to believe part of it was real. Anyways, I‚Äôm non-denominational. They won‚Äôt let me even be Catholic, which is a good thing I think and makes sense but at the same time is weird. See, I think I used to be a time traveler and the furthest they said they told me I went was the year 3000 when the British I think was a super power again (I don‚Äôt know for sure‚Ä¶). I don‚Äôt remember advanced buildings or anything it was pretty homestead (America) and less people (NWO) but lots of 6g and mind control and stuff and advanced tech. We found out we lived in a computer simulation, video game, matrix, e
tc. in the near future way before that probably by 2036 with scientific proof I‚Äôm guessing. I should know. I remember it on TV and the news. I guess Many Worlds Theory is correct but Quantum Immortality is not. Hence, I was cloned or had age rejuvenation done to me so I lived and possibly even time traveled partially to the year 3000 (possibly resurrected also I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶). But the point was to remember, perhaps even to help myself and maybe even humanity some day. The aliens (mainly greys as greys are fronts for reptilians and the Illuminati) have been controlling my life, have got into my head, and even have so-called demon possessed me. They play this game where if you believe in Christ they cannot possess or mess with you. It‚Äôs probably just a deal they have with the Nordics or something. Maybe Christianity is true, I don‚Äôt know, but they ?????? me up at least 10 times with real abductions. The other times were fake abductions. Perhaps, this post isn‚Äôt meant to be flagged but a cry out for h
elp. I‚Äôm being real and honest here. A lot can happen between now and the year 3000. We had a war, an alien invasion, and we repelled it. The British I think came out ahead by the year 3000. I guess I played a role in remembering how the NWO played out a trillion lifetimes ago. Things change. Different outcomes and events. I don‚Äôt know. Same ???? keeps happening in different ways at different times, etc. I‚Äôm sure some aliens all remember this better than me. Money would be nice, I guess. Personally, I think the aliens let them win. The British were and still are aligned with America around that year. I think it‚Äôs part of the one world government. Some sort of Reptilian aristocracy based off royalty. I didn‚Äôt have royalty so I was a peon or pleb lol. I don‚Äôt know. I believe I had a reptilian step-father in a past life or someone that was replaced and put there to watch over me and control me and ruin my life back then. It still comes back as bleed through and residual memories. They said they picke
d me because I was _NAME_ Titor. I still get dreams about it and memories through dreams. Like I was an Annunaki and now the Annunaki (who ruined my life in a huge way) are telling me they are Christian now. It was so crazy I thought my brother was thor-like, I was loki-like, and my step-father was odin-like because of something‚Ä¶ Like I remember I smoked pot in a past life in a parallel universe and the _PERSON_ started talking to me in high school era and started telling me stuff. It‚Äôs like I got some curse or alien dna or something going on with me like a propensity to be alien possessed. I‚Äôve probably never been to _PERSON_ but it would ??????? suck and I would hate it there. Probably hell on earth. I think some of these things we read are deliberate lies to hide the truth and I remember some of it. If I‚Äôm truly part _PERSON_, I‚Äôm not from Nibiru but got a genetic lineage but I doubt it. Why me? What makes me so special and different and smart? Doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense except I pushed myself 
harder than most ‚Äì before the schizophrenia. I remember even being an alien but I think they can transfer consciousness into an alien body which makes sense based off the gaia tv shows I‚Äôm watching too. I remember creating PKD as the pink light as VALIS in another life. I was on my computer. I came back via 2011-2013 or somewhere in between via reincarnation. Like the world changed somehow in that year. It feels like consciousness transfer back in time or we might live in a simulation now, I don‚Äôt know. I have theories. I feel like I know a damn lot even more than I‚Äôm saying now especially about matrix theory because I left the matrix, and helped run it. I think there are two types of reptilians: the ones on this planet and the inter-dimensional ones _PERSON_ talks about the run the simulation and have escaped it. I don‚Äôt remember much but they can cure schizophrenia for sure. I was there and was in peace. I was happy. I know some aliens want the simulations destroyed because the reptilians are trap
ping us here inside them."

175937828,"Opiates for treatment-resistant depression. ABSTRACT Aims: Until the 1950s opiates were often used in the treatment of depressive disorders (1). Because of the development of the tricyclic antidepressants, opiates fell into oblivion concerning this indication. However, only 2 of 3 depressive patients respond to newer antidepressants today, and even ECT achieves a remission-rate of only about 70%. Method: 3 patients (2f, 1m; 24, 39, 50y), suffering from major depression, were unresponsive to Tricyclics, SSRIs, Tranylcypromine, Venlafaxin and different combinations. Even ECT up to 14 treatment sessions remained unsuccessful. Subsequently, in an open label study patients were given Buprenorphine 0.8-2mg/d or Oxycodon 20mg/d as monotherapy. Results: In course of the opioid medication, within 1 week the HAMD-score decreased from 24.0 (range 19 to 28) before treatment to 4.3 (2 to 8) with opiate treatment, the BDI-score decreased from 27.3 (23 to 35) to 10.3 (9 to 12). Temporary appeared nausea, obstipat
ion and dysphoria. Conclusion: Opiates can be a hopeful option in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), even if ECT fails. Our results confirm former studies (2), but a new aspect is that in some cases of TRD opiates can be more effective than ECT. Perhaps, in these cases the endogenous opioid system is more impaired than the monoaminergic systems (3)."

And while I shopped everyone pretty much stayed away from each other except to pass in the aisles when need be and it was very quick, no talking.

174337225,"Hi, I am curious to know how people think in their mind when they are conscious (not sleeping). My assumption is in normal people as soon as they wake up from sleep their working memory and short term memory get filled with goals to do during the day, daily activities etc. When they engage in an activity coming up goals and other thoughts also in their mind so they not get distracted by current activity alone and they can quickly finish current and move to next. This was my usual thinking pattern before I started to notice negative symptoms. When negative symptoms start my thinking pattern is like this. Wake from sleep with no goals for the day, but few there like get out from sleep, go to toilet, have food etc but these goals not feel so compelling and again go to bed and some how get out due to hunger or some other things. But check mobile and do some thing and during this time mind is blank of any other thoughts so goals delayed and no awareness of time passing. At a time only the activity in ha
nd is on the mind so can waste time needlessly on it. If think of some other then other thoughts vanished from mind. So in order for me to do some thing I need to plan the steps and then do each step and at that time no awareness of next steps to do. Need to recollect the plan after doing each step and then follow like this. Previously I not need to recollect as coming up steps and other thoughts still on mind when doing each step. Anyone else like this? Please share how your mind thinks and if possible ask normal people you know to know how they thinks during day time. Thanks"

I have had to constantly tell myself not to let the ""stories"" in my head take over. When you are by yourself, constantly try to PRAISE yourself when you are keeping these ""thoughts"" at bay. Over time, it should get better, but it might take awhile to get back into the swing of how to ""talk"" to yourself. What helps ME when I'm in that ""mode"" and trying to ""get back"", is taking L-Theanine (an amino acid derived from green tea).It naturally puts your nerve system into a calm mode. Look it up.

It got to be way too much; also caused severe side effects- increased pulse and headaches. Hope more of us know the risks before using this medication for weight loss, motivation, side effects or off-label. I consider it to have been the most dangerous medication I have ever taken. It caused me to become irritable and hostile as well"

175937957,Keep moving. It‚Äôs a survival thing I believe in. It‚Äôs hard to put a target on your back so keep moving. Hobbies are good. Find something your interested in that is cheap. I tend to think of something I liked as a kid and try that. Usually it‚Äôs way too expensive but I‚Äôll try it out and get things to do with spare time. Work is good but you need some other things to make life better. Friends/partners/ family. Worth doing things with others. Hobbies will work too if you can find other folk who like what you like and that is pretty easy these days with social media. I‚Äôm always moving. I‚Äôm good socially. But I‚Äôm still moving.

175937967,"I also found this study Therefore, we investigated the effects of NEURAPAS¬Æ balance in vitro. NEURAPAS¬Æ balance inhibited the uptake of [3H]-noradrenaline, [3H]-dopamine and [3H]-serotonin into rat cortical synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner. EC50 values for the inhibition of noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin uptake were 88.6¬µg/ml, 90.4¬µg/ml and 173.9¬µg/ml respectively. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0029-1239934?lang=en And personally I‚Äôve seen improvements in terms of cognitive function and psychosis."

FINALLY Clozaril came around and it finally silenced them. It‚Äôs been about 8 good years now (knock on wood) they went away. The only pain is Clozaril requires a lot of bloodworks and follow-ups.
174337233,"I can‚Äôt believe how sick and delusional I am. Like I thought I was different people in past lives and other dimensions or parallel universes. Like how delusional and stupid and grandiose can I get? I‚Äôm pretty sure I experienced trauma several times including in past lives, but I never figured out why, really. I mean even if I did do stuff, it would have been in a different reality or past life. Like I believed I worked on UFOs, helped create bitcoin, was a time traveler, been to different parallel earths, was a super genius, was German in a past life, _PERSON_, know the cure for schizophrenia, was famous, was rich, and escaped and helped build the simulation (or a simulation), hate the sims, want to be real, suffered tremendous loss, was a victim, was a scientist, writer, psychic, was in the Illuminati, etc. I know there‚Äôs no evidence, but I still get paranoid. I know I am delusional and ????. I just wonder and think why can‚Äôt the government figure out who _USER_ID_ is? With all their power 
and tech and ????, and even these genius billionaires and programmers cannot figure it out‚Ä¶unless it wasn‚Äôt a single person or group, but a government project. I often think aliens, time travel, matrix theory, etc. was involved. I feel like it could have been inserted from a parallel universe (mandela effect) or our reality could be constantly edited and manipulated with. Not sure how. But I think something is going on like we live in a computer program in a lower dimensional reality being controlled by superior beings in a higher dimension. It‚Äôs baffling. Who will I be next? Will I have another delusion about being someone else? Obviously, it‚Äôs false and not true. I just think it‚Äôs stupid and I am gathering and gaining insight into my condition. It‚Äôs just stupid. Willl I be spider man or batman or super man next? lol I think of Voice of God technology (with time travel) so the people in the future can reverse the tech and send signals back in time. Probably not real yet ‚Äì or maybe it is. I thin
k of _PERSON_. Basically Voice of God tech is technology to insert voices into people‚Äôs heads. It‚Äôs sick. I‚Äôm dirt poor, but I think what if I‚Äôm this super famous smart guy that no one knows about? I know it‚Äôs not real, but why do I have these thoughts? Narcissism and grandiose beliefs? Do I have a inferiority complex lol? I have thousands or honestly hundreds of different delusions or false memories. I get memories of past lives which I think are from stupid energy drinks and are causing psychosis. A lot of smart, genius type people think they created bitcoin or know who he is. I know it‚Äôs not me and I‚Äôll never get any money. I just think it‚Äôs funny that I think it can be hacked with quantum computers, it will rise in price and then drop in the future eventually, and I don‚Äôt like or support it but I know about it and have interest in it. I don‚Äôt own any bitcoins lol. I feel like I had a quantum computer before given to me by space aliens in a past life and even something more powerful lik
e the Matrix. I worry a lot and I‚Äôm scared a lot because of these beliefs and delusions. I go to different realities a lot. I feel like I know a lot like stuff no one cares about or knows about. My thoughts and delusions are so complicated it goes off the deep end of the deep end lol. There‚Äôs no way I can cover everything in a post or on this forum. It‚Äôs so bizarre and unreal and surreal. Why do I think I am different people? Do I have a personal identity disorder or identity crisis? Dissociate amnesia? I don‚Äôt know. This is just random crap I‚Äôm posting."
175937976,"Hi MV, Sorry that you are having this uncomfortable effect. :/ I think you are wise not to be quick to switch in trying a new Rx at this point. Too many people make this mistake, and in the long run, prolong their search process for the right med for them. At six weeks in, and with a recent increase, what you are experiencing is pretty expected. You may be only half way through your start up process, where the initial s/e's are very common. I do think that if you push through and give it more time, that your system will eventually adjust....and if not, then you know with certainty that you did all you could, and gave it ample time (some people need up to 12 weeks to adjust and get the therapeutic benefits of their medication) Do your best to work your coping skills to combat the s/e's...and stay encouraged. You are on your way to getting the help that you need. S.C."

175937981,"I have good care now because I was finally able to get into the VA healthcare system where I have a very good psychiatrist who also does therapy/offers tips (45 minute sessions verses 10 minute sessions)--I feel like because I am able to discuss things with her so frequently and thoroughly that she can make better judgements when it comes to prescribing. This care was not available to me in the civilian healthcare system. For instance, when I was in that system, I had to make appointments more than 30 days in advance and most appointments lasted 10 minutes. The majority of civilian psychiatrists in our community do not take patients who do not have insurance and many aren't taking any new patients."

175937987,I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. Are you seeing dots and lines in your head? There are no muscles in your brain by the way.
175937988,I got like that a week before injection
174337240,"I‚Äôve been schizophrenic for 9 years and I take heavy duty, excellent medication. I don‚Äôt hear voices or hallucinate. I don‚Äôt expect to either. Have you been going down hill recently? I‚Äôve been going up hill. I was fine one day in college but not the next day. It just got worse not better. There was a period where it did get better but then the dissociation came back, and then I just went down hill after that."

174337251,"Maybe reality is very much different and complex than we can even imagine and comprehend. I don‚Äôt think sz dot com mods are gods. I do like them and respect them though and try to follow the rules. Maybe it has nothing or little to do with the brain at all. I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes, I doubt mental illness is even real or exists that it‚Äôs a social construct and something to make people sick. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs just the government, but that it‚Äôs a totalitarian government/Illuminati from the future or even evil aliens that are watching us. I believe government is inherently good, not bad, and we need it. My beliefs are delusions because doctors and humans cannot understand. We‚Äôre in the dark ages essentially (hope we don‚Äôt go back after simulation theory). The meds help but it‚Äôs like a band aid on a gun shot wound. The contradictory evidence you and others claim is weak or illogical at best. Until you come up with a theory of everything, build a universe, or even complete string theo
ry ‚Äì I‚Äôm not buying it and your not convincing me. The meds do help and some people are just plain schizophrenic/delusional. Some meds work right away and people move on with their lives. Some like me continue to struggle. I have never hallucinated anything even off meds and at my worst. I just have beliefs nobody cares or understands to listen to. I think I like schizophrenics and especially the unusual beliefs sections because it‚Äôs open minded and we can talk freely. No one really believes schizophrenics anyways. Imagine if they did‚Ä¶ I thought I had brain damage. I have a white spot or tumor or some ???? in my frontal lobe. Thought it was an implant for a while. Not sure if this has caused my delusions, increase in empathy, or total destruction in my ability to function. I also have a pineal cyst that may have been induced through trauma or is another possible implant in my opinion. Had some weird dreams that I have implants even up my ass lol."

175937999,"I see what you mean, yes, we learn stuff as we go along, I mean, this is obvious right? I don‚Äôt think anyone disputes that. But it‚Äôs your terminology and the implications you draw from those terms that I have issue with. For instance, the distinction between ‚Äútangible‚Äù and ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù is far blurrier than you seem to concede. At most it has heuristic value. _PERSON_ famously dismissed the theory of relativity for being ‚Äútoo theoretical‚Äù. Little he knew that this ‚Äútheory‚Äù would end up having so many ‚Äúpractical‚Äù uses, from gravitional lensing to black holes. You define concrete information as ‚Äúinformation you can apply‚Äù. This is extraordinarily fuzzy. Apply to what precisely? Does biblical scholarship become ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù when aiding the efforts of archeologists working in Israel? The truth is that we apply ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù information all the time and we couldn‚Äôt do otherwise. How do you think we can even process and operationalise ‚Äúconcrete information‚Äù without 
recourse to theoretical categories? It might seem that I‚Äôm polemicising but in actual fact I‚Äôm very grateful for your support."

174337256,You DO have a job. Surviving schizophrenia. That‚Äôs a full time job as far as I‚Äôm concerned.
175938017,"Well, it‚Äôs been forty years and they haven‚Äôt found anything yet that will make it go away. And I‚Äôm sixty now and it looks pretty certain that I will have it until I die or I become a U.S senator, whichever comes first."
175938018,I spoke to my case manager just now. He is a registered nurse for mental health Apparently things are not as bad as they seem Will post an update once I get more clarity. I got told off for being too hard on myself
175938019,I keep forgetting to call my pharmacy to ask my pharmacist about the pills and pill crusher and how I'm supposed to take them when they're crushed. Will do it tomorrow
175938020,"I haven‚Äôt been on here much lately. Have a lot going on. I had a major surgery a couple months ago and now I‚Äôm working 2 part time jobs while I transition to my new one. Anyway, I think it‚Äôs making me relapse. I have been having this feeling that I‚Äôm going to get sucked into the sky, and I‚Äôve had this issue before but never this much. The feeling just randomly hits me and it‚Äôs a very physical feeling in my stomach and I have to keep my eyes open and ground myself. I smoked marijuana last night and actually hallucinated radio voices and couldnt fall asleep from that without the TV on. I‚Äôve also been feeling dead. I cant understand how thisworld, what I perceive , is real. It just doesnt seem possible anymore. I‚Äôve thought before that j was dead in purgatory. It‚Äôs a similar feeling I guess."
174337258,"I am doing fine. I'm busy but still have time to rest. I am happy. I went shopping for food today. Life is not bad. I could not sleep last night so took two pills but today I slept and feel a whole lot better. I have another additional student this week and am hoping that I won't receive anymore students for awhile because it is a lot of prep work. This heat is getting to me but I work inside so it is ok. It's when I turn off my air conditioner and fan that I feel the humidity and heat. It is making me stay awake at night. So, I ate out yesterday and today. I also cleaned up my apartment yesterday by vacuuming and cleaning the toilet. I also washed my clothes and threw out the trash. I feel ok but have papers still on the floor and forgot to buy folders again. I will buy them soon. I feel ok!! Life could not be better. I am meeting a woman next weekend and may meet another one this week but don't know for sure yet. It is ok. I just take it as it comes. I hope to find a friend and more!"
175938021,"I‚Äôm very anxious. I have a doctors appointment in the morning with a new psychiatrist. It‚Äôs need a few years now since I‚Äôve seen a doctor. The first time I went to a doctor without being on medication or anything, I was forced into a hospital. I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll happen again."
175938022,Which inflammation?
175938023,Back when I was 20 I lived in my car for a few months.
175938024,I hear you _AT_MENTION_ . My family aren‚Äôt interested in my MI and have no idea how hard it is or that it‚Äôs a degenerative brain disease. They all expect me to be like them thru sheer will power and think I‚Äôm lazy. I‚Äôm scared of meeting new people. _PERSON_ helped a lot with that & exposing myself to my fear by going to tonnes of Meetups & meeting a lot of new people.
175938025,"I was very paranoid, thought people are out to get me, walked for hours aimlessly all the time, wouldn‚Äôt sleep for multiple days/nights, thought I was being watched and spied on."
175938026,"It must be hard not being able to say goodbye with so much history together. Something similar happened to me and my ex. We were togeher for 2 years but we argued all the time. I think the only thing that held our relationship together was that we were passionate. One day she found someone else and left me. We never got a good talk about things when she left. There were a lot of questions unanswered, and I suffered. She didn‚Äôt care. It was like a switch in her. When we weren‚Äôt together any more she couldn‚Äôt care less about me. It hurt me. Finally a couple of years ago I tore up all the pictures I had of her(I wish I had done it sooner) Who want‚Äôs to put someone who doesen‚Äôt care about you on a pidestal right? Now she only lives in my memory."
174337252,Not every day. You can have good days and bad off meds. I was off meds from December last year to June this year. I was stable until about May. Even then my symptoms were mild. Had enough insight to ask for a new shot before things got out-of control.
175938027,"Feel better, newtus!!!!!!"
174337257,"For me, it sounded like a real person in the same room as me."
175938029,"Thanks guys but i dont think i can do it there is too many things to think about, my brain just cant take in all the information. i feel like everything is really hard even drinking wwater which is supposed to be the easiesst thing to do whats a normal amount to pee? i think i pee about 5 litres every 5 days, so about a litre a day on average passes through, is that normal? seems to be less lately maybe i am just imagining it"
175938030,_PERSON_ is a mile way
175938031,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ It could just be that I‚Äôve been feeling bad for a very long time. I‚Äôve also been out of work for well over a year. Even though I said I hated working in the opening post of this thread, people have told me I seem happier when I‚Äôm working. No shame whatsoever to those who don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt work though.

174337259,A quote from the most recent email my bother has sent me . i did not say alot cos my life is dull i can only say i am well and went food shopping That reflects my own situation perfectly.

174337263,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Cannabidiol as a potential treatment for psychosis. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Therapeutic advances in psychopharmacology , 2019 Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are heterogeneous and often debilitating conditions that contribute substantially to the global burden of disease. The introduction of dopamine D2 receptor antagonists in the 1950s revolutionised the treatment of psychotic disorders and they remain the mainstay of our treatment arsenal for psychosis. However, traditional antipsychotics are associated with a number of side effects and a significant proportion of patients do not achieve an adequate remission of symptoms. There is therefore a need for novel interventions, particularly those with a non-D2 antagonist mechanism of action. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating constituent of the cannabis plant, has emerged as a potential novel class of antipsychotic with a unique mechanism of action. In this review, we set out the prospects of CBD as a potential novel treatm
ent for psychotic disorders. We first review the evidence from the perspective of preclinical work and human experimental and neuroimaging studies. We then synthesise the current evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of CBD in terms of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, safety and tolerability, and potential mechanisms by which CBD may have antipsychotic effects. https://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/2_PHONE_NO_ full article"

175938157,Its average I was on 80 and 120mg. It gave me bad akathisia and bad nausea though. It controlled my positives 80% but Risperdal 4mg controlled my positives by 95%.
175938158,I‚Äôm feeling much better after drinking a glass of milk and turning off the lights and going to my bed. I think I had some sort of an anxiety attack _AT_MENTION_ . I will definitely share my experience with my doctor. It was weird I think I might have had relapsed if I wasn‚Äôt on meds.

175938161,"I get this feeling often. It‚Äôs not a nice feeling. However, I do think your partner is right. One of the main differences between having a mental illness vs a physical illness is the _USER_ID_ that mental illness has. The negative viewpoints of others. These people often have no first hand experiences with what they‚Äôre stigmatizing too. Which is sad but also important because thoughts can change when challenged. Part of breaking _USER_ID_ is refusing to believe that you are less than or undeserving of love because you have mental illness. It sounds like your partner loves you very much. After all he‚Äôs chosen to be with you knowing that you have struggles. He wants to be there for you. His family may not be happy and that‚Äôs sad but it‚Äôs okay. Your relationship isn‚Äôt their decision. Let him be there for you and let yourself be there for him. I hope you feel well soon."

All can say is ‚Äúkeep on keeping on‚Äù. If you hang in there and just keep trying it‚Äôs possible things will get better.

I reme
mber back in the 1980‚Äôs when I had been sick for several years and I was discouraged like you and I was suicidal and losing hope I went to coffee with my mom and my future step-dad. I was like 24 or 25 and I was feeling really down and depressed and I felt like giving up. My mom and my step-dad were trying to cheer me up and give me hope and I remember they told me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up, they could come out with new medication any time.‚Äù And just a few years later the newer generation of anti-psychotic medication came out with less side-effects and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm on right now. They were right! I‚Äôm 59 now, I‚Äôve had schizophrenia since 1980, that‚Äôs forty years! But tonight, I‚Äôm sitting at my kitchen table, in my apartment I share with this other roommate, and I‚Äôm warm, full, and content. Tomorrow I go to my part-time job and I have a car and a little money in the bank. But to get here, I went through some horrendous times with my disease for many years. They say ‚ÄúTime heals all wounds‚Äù. Wel
l I outlasted the worst of my disease, I suffered but I just kept on plugging along, plugging along and plugging along. And my reward is today I drove over and visited my sister for a couple hours. On the way back I stopped at the local big electronic store and checked out all the neat stuff they have there. It‚Äôs huge and there weren‚Äôt many people there and I picked up a couple office supplies and treated myself to a Coke (Lol, OK, if you want to get technical, it was a Dr. Pepper). And earlier I had a phone appointment with a counselor from the community college, I‚Äôm taking a class this winter. Life goes on, it‚Äôs entirely possible that life can get better. I‚Äôve been at some very low points in my life, drug addiction was no picnic but I survived and came out the other end and learned some valuable lessons from getting clean and sober in 1990. Just keep trying and try new avenues to getting better. Use every resource you can that‚Äôs available to you. I wish I could make you happy or solve all your p
roblems but all I can tell you is my own experiences and what I‚Äôve learned. Things actually work out sometimes and just because you‚Äôre down and depressed or angry or bitter now doesn‚Äôt mean that things won‚Äôt get better in the future. I hope I said something that will help you in any way. As for now, I ate my Malt ""0 Meal, I drank my milk and I‚Äôm ready to relax. I hope things get better for you. See you around the boards!"

175938244,Thanks SP. I'm still having trouble sorting out what delusions are and what hallucinations are. I know when I see something no one else sees it is a hallucination or when I hear something no one else hears but I'm having more trouble with stuff that is in me that others say can't be in me like black gooey stuff and now possibly this painful spiky thing. I just need a way to soothe the pain that is radiating from my wrist and then get distracted so I don't think about it and dwell on it and then it will probably go away. I hope. Or migrate. It should be easy to get distracted at work but it isn't. It's hard.

175938249,"Honestly, I think you should just focus on getting a job that pays decent wages and has benefits, then doing the things you love in your spare time. Doing what you love for a living and relying on it for a paycheck is a really good way to start hating your passions. They stop being fun and start being chores. Just get an average job and keep making music when you‚Äôre off work. Maybe you can start doing a podcast or something if you‚Äôre interested in broadcasting.

175938256,"What do you mean by ‚Äúfears,‚Äù exactly? Like paranoia, or more like social anxiety and panic? How does it factor in with your positives?

You don‚Äôt seem to be living in your delusions; you have a lot of insight."
175938257,"So the tobacco package that has been sent to me with the name Riverstone and containing ‚Äústep into the wild‚Äù rizla plus filters, is doing wonders for my mind, but seriously distorting my throat and neck.

I have read that people who bow there head a lot should be avoided as they are only interested in power. A simple nod is polite, staring at the floor is not.

175938272,"Does anyone get this? I‚Äôve been getting this for years since I was little. When I‚Äôm watching something gruesome or scary (like in a scary movie), I feel something on my neck.

The biggest change for me was the sugar. She really made an impression when she explained the way the body processed the different types of calories we take in and how it preferred sugar and would just store the other calories. She also explained the spikes in our energy levels that sugar caused and I really realized how diet rich in high fiber foods could contribute to a steady energy level and a more consistent mood. I love the way sugar tastes but I love the way I feel without it more. Sugar is terrible, and I‚Äôm glad to be free from the _USER_ID_."

I told my dad we had to tell the police and he called the hospital and drove me there i thought there was a car following us and people screaming at me from their houses because they were in on it when i got to hospital i saw men (workers) going in the roof i thought they stayed up there i belived they were coming out at night and drugging me and i belived my family were going to die while i was there i was suspicious of other patients because i belived they were planted by my neighbor there were lots of little details and coincidences that sent me spiraling i eventually came out of hospital but was not much better i got to the point where i belived my family had to keep drugging me to make out i was crazy 
otherwise the neighbours were going to kill us i would only eat food in packs that no one could of opend then the tv was saying things relevent to me i thought my neighbours were blocking the real reception and somehow broadcasting what we saw there were alot of voices all day every day at one point i belived my neighbor had mistaken me for the devil and i had to scream out my window every morning as the sun rose i belive in jesus which i did also thought he was sacraficing animals and leaving them out side my window so i would not harm him this was over the span of 5 years and there are other side stories too."

175938310,That is horrible to have to deal with that. I know some get some joy from therapy if you find a good therapist. Just pays sometimes to talk about things to someone supportive and most psydocs are so under the pump for time. I don‚Äôt know if you do it but it could be worth investigating.

175938313,"I'm not sure if someone mentioned this already but it sounds like you are experiencing health anxiety which is a type of anxiety disorder. It is basically how it sounds but it involves being stressed about health and worried that you have something seriously wrong with you and compulsive actions such as going to the doctor and not trusting your doctor so you get a new one, searching the symptoms on the internet, etc. People with health anxiety tend to have a preoccupation with physical sensations and they seek medical attention instead of psychological help. Maybe you should try finding a therapist who specializes in Health Anxiety or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder because both of these disorders are treated with ERP therapy (Exposure Response Prevention therapy) and not many therapists know how to do ERP unless they specialize in OCD. Of course, I don't know for sure that you don't have something medically wrong but maybe you could try and do ERP and see if your symptoms get better. Good luck!"

175938326,"Hello and welcome! I am sorry to hear of the worries you are currently dealing with in regards to your medication. It is hard enough to deal with the anxiety itself...but then add med availability issues on top, and it is a lot to deal with. I agree that while discontinuing may be your eventual end game...simply running out of your meds is not the best way to go about it! You will want to have a doctor approved weaning schedule...as well as be in a place (preferably with therapy and self help skills) that will allow you to get along without an Rx, or at least as a lesser level than what you are currently on. So for now...what can you do? Since you are not established at this point with a doctor or clinic and don't have an appointment set up for an eval and script refill... ...your best bet might be looking into an outpatient/day program where you can at least receive the help and meds you need. If you can't find a program that's available...at least get set up with a healthcare facility/doctor and 
start the wait list process. Everyday you don't do it is another day that you are going without help...so even if it means you might run out of your meds before you get in....at least there is light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. If you need to, you can stretch your A/D's out to every other, then every 3 days... ...and look up water titration for your benzo. (basically crushing your pill and suspending in large quantities of water to make it go farther) There are videos on youtube where you can learn this method. I wish I could be of more help. Others may have other suggestions, so keep checking back. Also see our Resources at the top of the forum page here for some great self help material that will give you some valuable anxiety management tools. Keep posting as well. We understand, care and support is key! _PERSON_ Cat"

175938363,"When I was 19 I was working at the house of a friend of the families digging 2 1/2 foot deep postholes in really hard dirt. I had a crowbar and a small shovel. The task was to take 4 foot wooden 4 x 4‚Äôs and sink them in the holes so 1 1/2 feet of them would be sticking above ground. It was tough work, I was making like $4.50 an hour. The guy who hired me went inside to take a nap and left me to dig the holes. It sucked, it was a lot of work. So what I did while the guy was sleeping was go in his garage and take a saw and I took the four posts and I put everything in my car and drove about half a mile away to a wooded area and I sawed about a foot off the end of each post. That way, I would have to dig a foot less into the hard dirt. It worked. Instead of digging 2 1/2 foot holes I dug 1 1/2 foot holes, sunk in the four posts, filled dirt all around the posts and no one was the wiser.

I am also willing to consider the other side, that I don‚Äôt need an antidepressant or an additional antipsychotic. I could be overthinking things maybe. Overthinking is one of my weaknesses, I love to ponder things, which leads to rumination rather quickly, which, is not healthy in my opinion. This is why I keep myself busy with school and work that I find rewarding and enjoyable. Got straight A‚Äôs in my last classes, and made the switch to a new career. Gotta keep going.

175938400,"Since I was nine years old, I‚Äôve thought I was a celebrity and people were secretly watching me all the time. I personally believe I developed this belief to cope with the isolation and neglect I was experiencing at the time. Nowadays, it gives me a sense of importance and accomplishment, which helps me because in reality I have no accomplishments and feel completely unimportant as someone who can‚Äôt work and has no friends and pretty much no life. My brother and my dad have both reinforced how much of a failure I am because I can‚Äôt drive and I don‚Äôt have a job despite being 20, and the feeling of worthlessness has been a huge issue ever since I turned 18 and became an adult who hasn‚Äôt accomplished anything. This delusion has helped me feel like I have worth. The issue is, the belief has downsides. I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of mean voices lately and my mind interprets it as the people who watch me making negative remarks about me. It makes me wonder what‚Äôs wrong with me to make them hate 
me now. As you can imagine, thinking a bunch of real people are constantly making negative remarks about you is stressful, and I want to move past this idea all together. It will help me to start taking life seriously and working to better things and have real accomplishments, not the fake accomplishment of being a celebrity that I don‚Äôt even actually have. My biggest concern is how I‚Äôll cope without this delusion of grandeur. I‚Äôm suicidal a lot, have no self esteem or self worth, my only friends are online, and I don‚Äôt really care about how my family cares about me, I think they only love me because they‚Äôre supposed to and it doesn‚Äôt count towards my worth as a person. Moving away from this delusion will be a huge step for me. I‚Äôve had this delusion for eleven years. I think this will be a big step on the path to the complete or at least significant recovery I pray for. I just don‚Äôt know how to make this step without it backfiring. I‚Äôve always worried that without my ‚Äúfans‚Äù I‚Äôd fall i
nto severe depression and never come out. I only feel sort of ready to do this because I‚Äôve been taking a new antipsychotic and it‚Äôs been helping a lot with depression and helping me think more positively. Sorry for this overly long post. Input is appreciated. Thank you."

And you can help in your own treatment by being co-operative and honest when it comes to your disease. I‚Äôve been in several group homes. I did not want to be in any of them. But looking back, I see a couple of them really helped. In fact, I spent years doing things I really did not want to do. I spent the 80‚Äôs in hospitals and group homes and vocational programs and seeing psychiatrists and therapists and mental health housing. But I went through it and now I‚Äôm reaping the benefits of all that and I live pretty independently now. I have freedom now, and choices I didn‚Äôt have when I was younger.

174337342,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Examining the association between genetic liability for schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, IT _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, OA _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Translational psychiatry , Oct 22 2019 Psychosis (delusions or hallucinations) in Alzheimer's disease (AD?+?P) occurs in up to 50% of individuals and is associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes. Atypical antipsychotics, first developed for schizophrenia, are commonly used in AD?+?P, suggesting shared mechanisms. Despite this implication, little empirical research has been conducted to examine whether there are mechanistic similarities between AD?+?P and schizophrenia. In this study, we tested whether polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia was associated with AD?+?P. Schizophrenia PRS was calculated using Psy
chiatric Genomics Consortium data at ten GWAS p value thresholds (PT) in 3111 AD cases from 11 cohort studies characterized for psychosis using validated, standardized tools. Association between PRS and AD?+?P status was tested by logistic regression in each cohort individually and the results _NAME_-analyzed. The schizophrenia PRS was associated with AD?+?P at an optimum PT of 0.01. The strongest association was for delusions where a one standard deviation increase in PRS was associated with a 1.18-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.06-1.3; p?=?0.001). These new findings point towards psychosis in AD-and particularly delusions-sharing some genetic liability with schizophrenia and support a transdiagnostic view of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan."

174337354,"So I am still engaging with the politics of racism and though I am suffering no psychosis about it, my attachment to dealing with racism, both against me and others, has played a large part in the paranoias I experience when unwell. It has been a trigger, not instantly, but building up overtime and imprisoning me in paranoia when I relapse. I mentioned in another post that some people link Schizophrenia to Capitalism. Others link it to racism, and both of these are part of a wider idea that Schizophrenia is a product of your environment. The psychiatrist _PERSON_ famously proclaimed that it was not people that were mentally ill but society. I used to subscribe to this notion very strongly, believing that what I perceived was really out there in the world, and that the problem was the world, not me. This actually made me relapse far more often and be much more disruptive to other people when I did. It didn‚Äôt help. If the problem is society then you have to change society in order to heal. This is 
far harder than changing yourself. Thus engaging with the politics of racism is me believing in the reality of my attachments, becoming deluded about them, turning them into superstition. Everything we are attached to is a product of our minds and imagination, including our bodies, the so called Idea of Man or Woman that mystics speak about. We are always attached to something, but by putting faith in our attachments we become deluded about them and turn them into superstitions. In reality all attachments are transitory, constantly in flux, so putting faith in them is like building a castle on the shifting _USER_ID_. I am not saying that racism has no reality. But it is a product of our minds, and so not static. It is far harder to engage with something that is moving than something that is still. Racism seems to move very slowly, being so entrenched in our society, but it is still moving. Only God is absolutely still, and we can never perceive God, because we only perceive things that are a product of our mi
nds. Thus putting faith in anything we perceive is being deluded. Putting our faith in absolute stillness requires putting our faith in something we cannot perceive. The more I engage with my attachments, the more I become deluded about them, and the slower moving the attachments, the easier it is to engage with them and become deluded. As I said, we are always attached to something, not least our bodies. Denying the reality of everything we perceive is not helpful if it leads you to withdraw from life. But avoiding triggers is a must for Schizophrenics, and that means not being superstitious about what we perceive. Thank you."

174337346,"I wonder what it‚Äôs going to be like. The way they do psychiatry here is a little different from what I‚Äôm used to.

behind that. I stopped taking one of my allergy pills and I can‚Äôt breathe through my nose and I‚Äôm exhausted. So today I will pick up some allergy pills and see if that doesn‚Äôt set things straight in a few days once I‚Äôm breathing better again. The main problem I have is digging at my scalp. I get so anxious. I just dig until it bleeds. It hurts but it makes me feel better. I don‚Äôt know why I do this. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any med that can help this.

175938550,"I appreciate the response, as it gives a good indication as to where you are in this situation. I once had a problem in which I didn't know if I should move from where I lived or not. I had once seen a true crime TV show where the detective was looking at a crime and said that the original police group should not have concentrated on suspect A, and ignored subject B. That the police should have run a ""dual investigation"" and investigated both subjects. So I applied that to my problem of, should I move or should I stay? In other words, look into the possibility of moving by calling different apart. complexes as to price, etc. But also, improve your situation at your current address, so if you decide to stay that will be possible. I decided to stay, and the improvements were already done. In your case, you have a dual situation. One physical and one emotional. Why not work on both? Why not go to a general practitioner about the physical problem, and a psychiatrist about the emotional problem? You d
on't have to take any medicine that the doctor might recommend, but it would be good to get his or her opinion, and also to have a psychiatrist in case you needed one. Another thing that might be going on is that you might have negative feelings about the outcome of this. That you might be looking to stay with these problems rather than solve them. If you were raised in a negative household like I was, you might have a negative outlook on things, on problems. As in ""no way am I going to solve this problem."" You could be holding yourself back, as I was for many years. Were you raised in a negative household?"

We want to go visit our daughter in another state and of course he wants to come along. The problem with him is no boundaries. I did get a name for a therapist who is close by from my GI dr. She says I need to go as my stomach is always in knots from stress. Also I wake up in the morning thinking about my cancer and what treatments to have done. Its all up in the air right now till I find out if the meds are working well enough. I don't believe they are and absolutely hate the thought of surgery. I wake up with my jaw hurting from clinching my teeth all night. I am upping my amitriptyline and hope that helps. Honestly that med only makes me tired but maybe I am not taking the right dose.

Also, anything that helps alleviate the symptoms when you're going through a tough period? I have had a lot of exams recently which have caused me to stress alot more than usual, since starting the exams I have noticed my visual problems get so much worse. I hope this stops progressing:/ Hello Oen, I haven't noticed anything that has alleviated my symptoms as of yet. There have been long periods where I haven't noticed any issues so maybe it's brought on by something, but I haven't managed to find what yet. I decided to post on here today because this morning I saw the trail of my hand prominentely when I woke up, I can't replicate it now though - I'm going to see if the same happens tomorrow morning. I'll be mentioning this to my neurologist next time I see him (I go for regular checkups because of the Stroke) although I know for sure it's not related as it started way beforehand. 
When you have a Stroke as I did, the hospital give you a lot of examinations/tests/scans etc so I do know that it is not a sign of something serious or life threatening - hopefully that puts others at ease if they are worried and reading this. Good luck with your exams btw. ? 12345"

Not so much about the virus, but about the disturbance in my routines and people acting unpredictably because they panic. I hate that."
175938912,When you want to survive sz you need to learn to let go. Don‚Äôt give it serious importance otherwise you can be in serious trouble. You know its a delusion. Don‚Äôt stress about it. You watch to many movies. Read or watch something realistic like a human history or states of the world. You feed yourself with BS. Get a garden to care about.
175938913,"i think you should be even more worried about clonazepam withdrawal than sz symptoms come back, withdrawal from benzos can make you more psychotic than sz even, in addition to possible seizures and death among many other things you need to keep taking your meds, all of them, dont change anything with your meds unless your being told to by a doctor, its no joke if your on that many meds its for a reason and you run alot of risk stopping even 1 of them without talking to a doc so stopping all at once is like asking for problems"

175938916,"_AT_MENTION_ I‚Äôve been ‚Äúconcentration camp‚Äù thin as well, without having an eating disorder. The problem with gaining weight entirely through diet is that, first of all, if you have a naturally lean body, that‚Äôs difficult. Second, when you do gain weight, that extra weight will consist almost entirely of fat. I really recommend that you do strength training. It will help you gain weight and ensure that your body looks better and is healthier. And also, it‚Äôs just an easier way to do it. And if you do decide to drink bulking up drinks, you should buy it in powder form. The single-sized drinks are incredibly expensive compared to the powder versions."

175938921,"I saw this woman on the internet lamenting this 28 year old guy who thought he deserved credit for not being sexist. Actually, a man who isn‚Äôt sexist isn‚Äôt very common in some places.

They‚Äôre made to walk on.‚Äù I saw a film about a woman in Afghanistan who was stoned to death because her husband said she‚Äôd been unfaithful. I agree that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done in the U.S., but we do deserve at least some acknowledgement that we aren‚Äôt like those guys. Also, most of these bad boys that so many women love are mysoginists."
175938922,"hi _AT_MENTION_ I have rage issues due to chronic trauma in my developmental years. Most of the (very expensive) therapists I saw fired me because I was too angry. It was very damaging, like getting dumped. I suffer from a lot of rage and my meds help a bit to curb it but it is still hard on a daily basis. I‚Äôm not silent and mean, I‚Äôm verbal & mean because I don‚Äôt like being disrespected - it‚Äôs an injustice & I won‚Äôt settle for disrespect."
175938923,_AT_MENTION_ I think you and I will go at our own self pace. It‚Äôs a win-win if we both lose some weight.
175938924,Welcome to this community _AT_MENTION_ !
175938925,"Well it‚Äôs insanely expensive to die. We just filed away all the funeral crap from my father-in-law. It was just over 12 thousand to cremate him, have a showing, then the service at the cemetery, cars to transport us all, and a nice dinner/cocktails thing. Plus we paid cash for food at the showing, flowers, tips, etc. luckily he was a veteran so the stone was paid for or that would have been like another grand. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Even my moms was around 8k all said and done. And that was omitting a cemetery service. We had a tree planting ceremony at home with immediate family only. This is why I say I can‚Äôt even afford to die lol in that sad kinda way."

Sending you some llama luck."
175938928,Violence is never an answer. If you can punch you could damage someone severely. If you struggle seek help. Jail isn‚Äôt good for anyone with a mental illness.

175938933,I live with my voices. They are my company. They are my mythology.
175938934,"Nice to hear from you, and congrats! I‚Äôm trying hard to lose some weight but it‚Äôs hard to motivate myself to use the new exercise bike‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just so darn lazy. And my akathisia stopped so I don‚Äôt need to burn off energy or anything. Here I go talking about myself again‚Ä¶ the point I should be making is good for you! It‚Äôs quite an accomplishment to lose weight."
175938935,Well it‚Äôs not up to me anymore. But we‚Äôre not reddit or 4chan.
175938936,"Thanks for the response. The only thing I worry about with seeing a doctor is that they might see I have sz, and automatically think it‚Äôs psychosomatic. However, this feels like something physical that‚Äôs beyond my control."
174337458,Basically I don‚Äôt lead with my illness. I don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúHi I have schizophrenia‚Äù I let people get to know me a little bit. The response I‚Äôve got from most people is that they don‚Äôt care. Never lead with your illness.
174337466,"There have been 5 different types of voices. A soundless voice (the most common type of voice I get) A voice that I can hear in my mind A voice that I can hear in real sounds (like when chewing food there can be a voice heard coming from where the chewing sound is coming; it also sounds like chewing, and typically speaks in the rhythm of chewing) A voice like a real external sound (the rarest type of voice I get) A thought that has verbal content (contains words) I‚Äôve heard male, female, and genderless voices. I‚Äôve had characters for short periods (like the Programmer, the Program, and Youthful), but they‚Äôve all disappeared by now. My schizophrenia has come up with stories and fake situations in the past, and made the voices or/and inserted thoughts tell them to me. These days the voices mostly talk about things related to the plan of making me suffer infinite and eternal torture after death, or comment on the inserted thoughts I get or things I see."
175938937,"I have a chart that shows fruits and vegetables and their peak growing season, and also if they‚Äôre available canned/and or frozen. I‚Äôm gonna use it to help me shop.

175938938,I have an autism diagnosis. I believe in god though. I find it hard to believe in god. But I do believe and I do find it helps. For me I use passages of the Holy scriptures to rationalise the world. And it is logical to me. Whilst my emotive feelings for god might appear superficial my conviction in the passages I use to rationalise events or circumstances are much the same way I trust a mathematical equation to follow rules and have an exact solution because of the truths associated with the method.
175938939,"I haven‚Äôt tried it, but I hear from other forum members that it is really helpful."
175938940,I feel quite unproductive but taking time to work on myself so I dont end up quitting everytime is probably time well spent‚Ä¶
175938941,Let it go and move on. Try to avoid spamming the boards with the same topics. That become problematic for the community. We don‚Äôt diagnose here and that isn‚Äôt what a support site should be about. Just understand your journey might be different from others‚Ä¶ Be kind to others as well simply as they are doing it tougher than you sometimes. Always good to remember.
175938942,But the alters do remember to fill the gaps by writing things down? Just curious.
175938943,I still wouldn‚Äôt be worried about it. The police have bigger fish to fry than someone looking at a girl in a bikini. I doubt that would even qualify as child porn if she was clothed. Just be more careful next time.

Joking aside, as I know you seem to torture (curiosity) yourself with it so much, I would say when an intellectual thought becomes a rumination and when the rumination then goes on to obsession and interferes with the day to day running of your life."

175938955,"Thank you all, I really appreciate everyone on this forum so much! I did talk to my husband. He took it a lot better than I expected, I am still a little worried it might come to blows when he sees FIL next‚Ä¶ but it would serve that prick right after years of inappropriate behavior. And as far as the grandfather in-law situation, the talk of moving him in with us is now off the table, and I wont be going to his house alone anymore. THAT part of the conversation took some convincing, husband didn‚Äôt want to believe it was anything more than an innocent family kiss. I can understand WHY he would want that to be nothing, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be incredibly uncomfortable when we have to deal with it/him, and handling awkward confrontations is not at all in his wheelhouse. So I had to give him all the gritty details to get him to admit that it was over the line. Wish I didn‚Äôt have to put those images in his head, but as a therapy-going survivor of rape I know that this is not MY fault."

Working as given me a sense of purpose as well, and when my employer trusts me I feel that I‚Äôm doing my part in society. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about. Although my family was resentful towards my mental illness, I‚Äôm worried that they‚Äôre going to hate themselves when I die. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to drive my family to shame should my illness get exposed. This is why I do not like my existence because I feel like I‚Äôm just going to sit there and burden people. I just want to tell you that I suffer from a genetic disorder that I inherited from my parents. My parents are carriers of defective variants. My physical disease has placed collective guilt on my parents because my parents think that they passed it on, and they are upset that they‚Äôve done this to me. I think that‚Äôs why I feel horrible as well. I‚Äôve tried from time to time that 
it‚Äôs NOT their fault, but they keep saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs my fault, I did it to my daughter‚Äù. It frustrates me. I guess I‚Äôm just uniquely different, seeing my physical and mental illnesses, both genetic."

I was shaking so bad I couldn‚Äôt make coffee. My cousin made some for me. I have a temp of 103. So far I‚Äôm having chills fever headache nausea delirium.

175939010,"You know everyone says to look on the bright side of things and to try and focus on the positive rather than the negative. When you‚Äôre sad and usually ask for advice, the most common thing said is ‚ÄúThings are gonna get better. Try and look at the good things coming out of the situation.‚Äù But you know what really messes me up? I‚Äôve never really been told that sometimes it‚Äôs okay to be sad. It‚Äôs okay to cry over things and feel bad about it. I‚Äôve found that crying about things and being sad over something helps me way more than trying to stay positive in the situation. If I don‚Äôt cry over something, I‚Äôve never really dealt with it properly or comfortably. I understand that it can worsen things but in the end, you‚Äôll feel much better because personally I feel like I get more off my chest. It may sound odd but that‚Äôs how I feel. When I give my friends words of advice, I tell them ‚ÄúFeel sad about the situation. Cry, scream, kick, fight. Do whatever makes you feel better without h
urting you or someone else. But you only have 24 hours to feel that way. After the 24 hours is up, you pick yourself up and find ways to better the situation. There are gonna be times where you feel that you can no longer go on.

This example shows that you can find some peace once you‚Äôre aware of the issue, and what you can do to overcome it. Literally I was blaming all sorts of different things over the last few weeks on my anxiety levels being through the roof, but I did not even begin to consider the most important thing that caused it.

I think my doctor said that if you have had multiple episodes you should wait 5 years with treatment before trying to stop medication (if I remember correctly). So In about 4 years I will maybe give it a try lowering the dose. Yeah, I‚Äôm hopeful that better meds will come in the future that gives less negative symptoms and less side effects overall. That would be good. Right now I‚Äôm only supplementing with omega 3 and vitamin D, I‚Äôm feeling alright, omega 3 helps a lot for stress.

175939057,"You had no grounds, what you said wasn‚Äôt properly thought-out, it came across as an outburst. ALso, you‚Äôre showing yourself to be quite infantile, trying to ‚Äúdiscredit‚Äù me by drawing capricious analogies with anti-vaxxers, or calling me names like ‚Äúquasi-intellectuall‚Äù or appealing to the herd for support, and more recently MrSquirrel. Stand up for yourself and own your words."
175939058,I suppose its impossible to be 100% sure due to the existence of repressed memories etc. It would be more accurate to say that I‚Äôm about as sure as someone can be that I didn‚Äôt experience any of this stuff for real. As far as I can tell I don‚Äôt have any symptoms or conditions that would imply something must have happened like you have with DID
175939059,Nice to see you back _AT_MENTION_

175939061,"I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of ???????? nowadays. Between my family, my partner‚Äôs family and symptoms coming back. I called the nurse and she called back but I missed the call. My phone was turned down on accident. Anyway it‚Äôs just been depression and anxiety plus hallucinations . I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about the hallucinations. The voices of people I know coming from other rooms and if I go to that room they jump to another room and I hear them talking about me. The way food taste now I cant take it. It taste metallic"

175939067,I stopped going to church because I found churchgoers to be very hypocritical and I‚Äôm not a Christian anymore. I used to have many religious delusions and I used to have an obsession of sinning and going to hell. I finished reading the Bible earlier this year and I found it to be bullsh*t. According to the Bible Jesus died for everyone but everyone still goes to hell except for some saints. Screw that!

174337480,"hi everyone. i think that being shut in for so many years prepped me for this quarantine. But now I have to do my pdoc appt over the internet, that's gonna be weird. I'm not that good with ppl in person so I don't know if I will like the online appt or not.

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs normal or not but I‚Äôm going to mention that to him today and see what he says. He always tries to adjust my hip, but he just can‚Äôt get it. Maybe today will be lucky.

175939073,"Don‚Äôt be ashamed of having times when you struggle. Everyone has times they struggle. I know it can be really discouraging to have bad days when you worked so hard for your good ones. But bad days aren‚Äôt a sign you are failing. They are a sign that you need some time to recover. Think about your phone battery. You don‚Äôt wait until your phone is on 1% before you charge it, right? You try to keep it higher than 20% so the battery lasts longer, and if you do accidentally let it get to 1%, it slows way down and starts glitching. Then you need to let it charge a whole lot longer than you would if it was plugged in at 20%. Same with people. We aren‚Äôt designed to work ourselves ragged through severe stress for prolonged periods of time. We can push ourselves through stress, but only if we then give ourselves ample time to recover afterwards. And it isn‚Äôt good to do it repeatedly. You have incredible drive and self-discipline. But I see you falling into a pattern of being mad at your brain and co
nsidering it weak when it is clearly asking for rest."

I am only doing an associate‚Äôs for now, because it is much cheaper than a bachelor‚Äôs, and I already have a bachelor‚Äôs degree in art. I could technically get into a Master‚Äôs program already, if my undergrad grades had been good enough. But I kept getting waitlisted to master‚Äôs programs because I only have a 3.0, so I figured getting my associate‚Äôs will help me with getting the prerequisite classes done for cheaper boosting my GPA so I look more competitive I think my professional experience combined with a strong GPA and a science degree will make me much more attractive for master‚Äôs programs. I don‚Äôt worry about my grades this time around, because I have been stable for years, and I have much stronger organization skills now, plus I now know it is my right as a student to have access to disability services.

175939082,"I appreciate this reply thank you. It helps knowing other people have had this happen. I‚Äôm kind of obsessive about my illness label because I have a lot of trouble comprehending what‚Äôs going on and having a label to pin symptoms to makes it feel less chaotic, if that makes any sense. But you‚Äôre right, I can imagine psychiatrists need more education on that stuff for medication uses and therapists mainly focus on improving lives."

When my mother caught me she had a problem with the nicotine, so I asked her if I can continue with 0 mg and she agreed. I bought 0 mg just to show her but continue vaping 3 mg. She has not been hooked on nicotine so she can‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like for nicotine to get me. If you‚Äôre an adult then your dad shouldn‚Äôt be telling you what to do, much less guilting you with tears. I get that your dad loves you but vaping isn‚Äôt a moral test.

175939086,"Yeah it was really hard for me when I got my diagnosis back in 2018 and ‚Äúcame to‚Äù from my psychosis. I was petrified that I would not be able to take care of myself or be able to trust my own perceptions. I was also angry at myself for what I did while psychotic and apologized to a lot of people. Now that I think about it, there was a lot of anger toward myself and then despair about my future. I‚Äôve dealt with self-_USER_ID_ by pushing myself to do things that I didn‚Äôt think someone could with my diagnosis and being around others. It‚Äôs dramatically changed how I think about myself and I am still developing a new identity."
175939087,"Hey guys, I was just wondering what tips and tricks you have learned to cope with being stuck in the house or just deal with the emotional toll of feeling anxious all the time?

175939089,Where here for you
175939090,"You said you have a history of anxiety since you were 13. You said you took Effexor, which net says is an anti-depressant, but you said you have anxiety. Maybe you need something for anxiety. Would you be more comfortable with a female psychiatrist? You also said you were a perfectionist, which will understandably make it more difficult for you to accept either a physical or a mental condition which calls for treatment such as with medicine. This website offers information and resources that can help with these situations. This data is located above the list of names and problems of this forum if you want to look at that. Included in that is being positive that you can solve this problem, which opens your mind to possibilities, while negative thinking about the problem closes your mind to possible answers because we aren't looking for one. I can understand your desire not to take medicine at 20. I did not take Lithium for my bipolar until after 30, one because I was misdiagnosed as only depressed. 
I had rough times without the medicine, but medicine does have side affects. We have a choice to live with our mental conditions, tyr out non-medicine procedures or to take medicine. So you aren't completely out of control here. This is your choice. Which is good that you have a choice. You're probably making the best one, I don't think you're making a negative one. Are you able to function? Can you go to school or work or do volunteer work? Are you satisfied with your life without medicine or non-medicine efforts? I know it has to be rough, it was rough for me as a bipolar with no medicine at your age and for 10 more years for I didn't know I needed it. You said, ""For some reason, I have all of the evidence in front of me and I still refuse to believe it's anxiety."" That's understandable. 1 2"

Anyway thats the hard thing to understand, that its a split and sometimes only one of true self/false self will control your body while the other one will have to watch what happens uncontrollably, false self is motivated by threats so if you might lose something because your true s

175939171,I spent 8 years in the workforce. State run rehabilitation services did a psyche evaluation and deemed I wasn‚Äôt fit for training. I was only out of the hospital for a month. So I got a job on my own. I started out cleaning toilets. I was cleaning other peoples waste off of toilet seats. People made fun of me and I was looked down on. Within a year I found someone willing to train me in a trade. I then went on to work at _NAME_ Motor Company. I advanced quickly. After 3 years at _NAME_ they found out I had schizophrenia. They started writing me up 2 times a week. They wrote me up for stuff I didn‚Äôt even do and I had proof. They were building a case to fire me. When they fired me I cried. There was nothing I could do. Here in the states for me to get my medication I need to have a job that provides health insurance. My medication costs $1200 a month. If I get fired or laid off I lose my health insurance and I can‚Äôt afford my medication. I had to overcome a lot to get where I was mentally and in 
the working class. I had to give it all up and go on government disability. I now get in a month what I made in a week at _NAME_. All you can do is give it your best.

175939177,"I would like to say I am studying physics now although still working on my bachelors degree and unfamiliar with the specific math and labels given to known thoughts and theories, however I believe I have an inherent understanding of the function of the universe at a ‚Äúparticle‚Äù or quantum level. Quantum physics and mechanics are my specialty. I believe and agree with you almost completely but I would like to suggest understanding it less as interacted particles and more as iterations between waves and groups of waves with similar yet variant frequencies. All particles are only groups of these waves and frequencies interacting with each other. Our minds (the human mind) is designed to manipulate these frequencies in a manner that allows us to interact with the world around us and continue to gain knowledge. Knowledge itself is a frequency absorbed by the field the the innumerable frequencies within or bodies that create a physical corporeal being. As we gain knowledge of the immersive around us i
t alters our own frequency allowing us to attain a higher and more complex frequency and understanding of how things operate, thus is the point of existence. As we increase the complexity and essentially ‚Äútune in‚Äù to the universe we are able to achieve higher levels of control of it. However with these higher levels of control we also lose our physical ability to remain within our known third dimensional existence and essentially ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù into a higher level of consciousness making our resonant ‚Äúspirit‚Äù if you will, the same deities that you speak of."

174337514,"I used to have some serious problems with my working memory and concentration until I learned about how the brain works and found some supplements that can fix the chemical imbalances. SZ is more than just Dopamine dysregulation, which the antipsychotics and CBD can help with, but it also involves a significant acetylcholine (AC) deficiency usually. AC is the the main neurotransmitter involved in memory and focus, some antipsychotics actually do correct some of this imbalance a little which is why some APs can help with negative symptoms some more than others. There are a lot of supplements that can correct this imbalance and your memory and focus might even become above average like my case. Huperzine A is similar to drugs used to treat the degenerative brain disorder of Alzheimer‚Äôs, which involves significant memory loss. It prevents the break down of AC to some degree and you only need 20 micrograms once or twice a day. Examine.com ‚Äì 22 Jul 18 Huperzine-A Supplement ‚Äî Health Benefits, Dosa

And if you ever take too much and experience this you can use cogentin or benzotropine which you doctor will probably prescribe to you if you take AP which can al

175939196,"Ok so today has been a bad one. It started out good but then a bunch of stuff hit the fan. I went and told a friend of mine that i call my brother the truth about what his ""girl"" was doing behind his back while they were ""trying to fix things"". Another friend of mine was staying with this girl and because my brother found out the truth he shut off the power and water to the house that she was living at because he doesn't live there anymore and they were in his name. Well this caused issues with my other friend, we will call her M. Well M has been having issues with her soon to be ex-husband and her kids. he was keeping them from her but got his rights took away and lost the kids, so she just got her kids back 2 days ago. Because she was living there also she just lost her kids, not the custody, untill she is able to get an apartment of her own. But the teacher can only keep the kids until Tuesday. So needless to say the only place she had to go is my trailer. So in the next 3 days i have to get 
all of the clutter in my house into a storage unit, which i cant afford, get my house sprayed for roaches, cause i live next to a permanent food source for them, get more beds for 4 more kids (remember I have 2 of my own), get more food in my house, etc. I know i have help to get this done but my anxiety is through the roof after today. For the last 5 hours i have done nothing but dealt with police, Child Protective Services, and a b**ch that is starting to harass M, saying it is her fault that this has happened and for not ""helping"" her while she lived there. Never-mind the fact that M has done nothing but hand her money for the last 3 months and she has blown it all. Im just stressed all to HELL!"

175939203,"Hey, after testing with Mucuna/L-Dopamine by stopping and retaking it, I found out that it improved my negative symptoms a bit at the recommended 2x 120mg L-Dopamine pills dose. Of course I wanted more so I increased to 5x 120mg L-Dopamine negatives are even better (waking up much earlier with more energy) but I am getting very early signs of psychosis which is freezing/catatonia. Usually for me after that phase I start getting hallucinations and then delusions. I am trying to find the perfect dose to reduce negative symptoms without making positive symptoms worse. I read that some Parkinson patients are given L-Dopa alone without Carbidopa and it still works but it just needs a higher dose vs L-Dopa+Carbidopa combination. You can try it but just be cautious that too much can cause psychosis or can worsen positive symptoms."

175939283,"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-00870-x Fear, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are quite common and debilitating, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of ~28% in Western populations. They are associated with excessive fear reactions, often including an inability to extinguish learned fear, increased avoidance behavior, as well as altered cognition and mood. There is an extensive literature demonstrating the importance of N- methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function in regulating these behaviors. NMDARs require the binding of a co-agonist, D-serine or glycine, at the glycine modulatory site (GMS) to function. D-serine is now garnering attention as the primary NMDAR co-agonist in limbic brain regions implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. L-serine is synthesized by astrocytes, which is then transported to neurons for conversion to D-serine by serine racemase (SR), a model we term the ‚Äòserine shuttle.‚Äô The neuronally-released 
D-serine is what regulates NMDAR activity. Our review discusses how the systems that regulate the synaptic availability of D-serine, a critical gatekeeper of NMDAR-dependent activation, could be targeted to improve the pharmacologic management of anxiety-related disorders where the desired outcomes are the facilitation of fear extinction, as well as mood and cognitive enhancement. Pathological fear and anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which are associated with exaggerated reactions to fearful stimuli and an inability to extinguish learned fear, underlie some of the most common and debilitating psychiatric disorders1. The understanding of the neural circuitry and genetics underlying PTSD has rapidly progressed over recent years, and there is great interest in developing novel pharmacologic treatments based on these findings. Human neuroimaging and rodent models have implicated numerous cortical, subcortical, and midbrain regions in producing the symptoms observed in patients 
with PTSD (Fig. 1a). This disorder is frequently conceptualized as a memory disorder with dysregulated fear learning at the core of many of its signs and symptoms2. Three of the most well studied and interconnected brain regions linked to PTSD symptoms are the _USER_ID_, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus (HP). In PTSD, there is a failure of top-down cortical inhibition, leading to the reactivation of memories associated with trauma-related thoughts and feelings. Failure of top-down inhibition impairs the ability to extinguish fear3, which is the active learning of a new non-threatening association. Thus, previously dangerous stimuli are no longer considered fearful. PTSD patients exhibit deficits in recall of extinction memory and display diminished activation of the mPFC and HP, which correlates with symptom severity and disrupted prefrontal-_USER_ID_ functional connectivity3,4. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the neurobiological underpinnings related to altered cognition and mood a
re due to dysfunctions in the hippocampus and _USER_ID_ and their ability to regulate PFC top-down control5."

175939437,"I had anxiety attacks for some years and in both cases they were caused by the medicine I was taking. The first medicine was an anti-psychotic, Stelazine. I'm not sure it was the right medicine, obviously not, for it started giving me anxiety attacks the first or second night I took it and the psychiatrist kept me on it for a long time. I was bipolar, but don't know if I was diagnosed as that. The 2nd time, I was treated for depression only, and was really bipolar, so without a stabilizer like Lithium, which I'm on now, the anti-depressant pushed me into mania and anxiety attacks. And those would occur, like yours, the moment I went to sleep. When I was put on Lithium and an anti-depressant, the anxiety attacks stopped, and that was many years ago."

Thank you for telling us that you are in Iran so that we can understand that things are different in your world. I wish that you could talk to someone about what happened because you need that. When bad things happen to us and we DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT then the things which happened just affect everything in our life, and not for the better. One of the most troubling thing you have said is ""maybe I wanted it"". That is a lie you are telling yourself! That is not truth. By telling self that, you are trying to make the incident LESS TROUBLING, and that will not work. You were only 10 years old then...you did not want that to happen to you. You are now trying to apply adult thinking to your 10 year old self, and that does not work either. Maybe it will be good if we talk about other things for a bit, and see how your life is going for you now. Have you finished school? Are you working? Do you liv

I could talk to someone for hours and had fun with it. Attention wasn‚Äôt as good, but it wasn‚Äôt so bad either. Before I was given the injection I was just a normal person, being able to communicate and function as if nothing happened. At first they gave me olanzapine and I was ok with it, it wasn‚Äôt bad for me, maybe except being more sleepy during day. Then they started to give me oral aripiprazole and shortly after the first pill I started to notice side effects. Doctors didn‚Äôt care at all, they just insisted to give me a shot and they did."

175939488,"Sorry, this is really long! This sounds like OCD to me. I have OCD and I feel like my mind is playing tricks on me often. I don't know how familiar you are with OCD but basically a person has intrusive thoughts related to one or more ""obsessions"" and then there are ""compulsions"" that they do to try to get rid of the stress. For example, my obsession right now (it tends to change over the years) is with rabies. One day my sister came home and mentioned that she pet a sick looking bunny on a walk and I don't know why but my mind immediately thought of rabies. I've never thought of rabies more than the average person before that but since then (about 3 months ago) I have been tortured by the fear of bats and getting rabies. Some of the compulsions that I have been doing are closing my vents so bats can't get in, blocking the crack under my door so bats can't get in, thinking through situations over and over again (like I'll think 'what if a bat got me when I went outside and I didn't notice?' so t
hen I think through my every move I did while outside over and over) and researching rabies and bats on the internet. You probably think I sound crazy and I KNOW it sounds crazy but I am struggling to shake the obsession. That's the thing about OCD, logically I know that it is unlikely that I will get rabies and I know my actions are crazy but I just can't stop doing them. So your obsession would be wondering if you are gay which is actually not an uncommon obsession. What makes me think that its OCD is that you are very stressed by this thought and think that it may be true despite the fact that you still don't have an interest in men. It doesn't make sense rationally but you just can't shake the thought as it has become an obsession. You also talk about how you feel like because you had that thought it must mean something which is another common OCD thought. From what I've read, I found that everyone has ""intrusive thoughts"" like maybe you are standing by a ledge and think ""what if I just jumped off of t
here?"" and you don't actually intend to and someone without OCD would just have that thought and then let it go but someone with OCD gets stuck on that thought thinking why did I think that? It must MEAN something. Maybe you can see if you can identify any compulsions you have related to this? Some compulsions are simply avoiding things like I avoid going outside. To stop the obsession you have to stop the compulsions which is really difficult but basically you to sit there dealing with your stress and not do the compulsions that would relieve the stress and over time this desensitizes you to your fear. Its called Exposure Response Prevention therapy. Hope this helps! Here's a link to an article about this: https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/homosexual-obsessions/"

I only drink water and black coffee because calories in drinks can add up fast. and only on special occasions soda. I try to incorporate more vegetables into my diet. I think little changes is the best way to begin. Like if you drink whole milk, maybe try drinking 2% instead. What I try to do is put more of the good stuff in (healthy food). Then slowly cutting back on the unhealthy stuff. One trick I do is eat my vegetables first during a meal then I'm likely to eat less of the more calorie dense stuff on my plate becaus

Some concern has been raised about stroke risk in people taking niacin. In one large study, people who took high doses of niacin had a two-fold greater risk of stroke compared to those not taking niacin. However, it is unlikely that this outcome was due to niacin.

174337624,"NAME CHANGE Ethnicity, religion, ancestry, gender, social class, birth order, physical appearance, time and place of birth all contribute to what is called identity, and most of these contributions can be reflected in a person‚Äôs name[ 20 - 22 ]. A name change is therefore a powerful way to assume a new identity. Changes of name can act as connections[ 23 ], a way for instance, of blending in with a new environment, of marking a valued affiliation or being reborn into a new religion. Sometimes, however, changing one‚Äôs name can serve as a separation. It can be a way to hide one‚Äôs former identity, to repudiate one‚Äôs ancestry. These different motivations apply to persons with schizophrenia as to anyone else with the added possibility that the wish to hide a previous identity in this population stems from paranoia and originates in delusional thinking. In a 12-year retrospective study of patients attending a psychiatric unit (31% of whom suffered from schizophrenia), it has been reported that 0.
7% had at some time in life adopted an alias[ 24 ]. That part was crazy to me because I used to go by a different name/alias online and it became my true identity to me in a way I always suspected this the cause of my schizophrenia. Sure my decisions made the disease worse but that was the real change of the mind in a peculiar way."

174337635,"I went back to review the article, because I think it‚Äôs important. They were not taking people who were first diagnoses or off meds and wildly psychotic and seeing what the symptom reduction was from there. They were testing it on people who were already pretty stable. So to have a continued reduction over time plus better side effect profile is pretty good. Part 1 [of the open label switching study] was conducted in 302 patients with stable, generally mild schizophrenia symptoms while on risperidone, olanzapine, or various other antipsychotics commonly prescribed in the United States. Part 2 was also on 603 patients with stable symptoms on standard-of-care antipsychotics. So stable and mild and then further improvement of 20% or more for 30-41% seems perfectly respectable. It‚Äôs also possible that for some of those they did not see much further improvement in the PANSS score but liked the med anyway because they stayed about the same, but lost weight or had their prolactin go down. It also seem
s to be much more effective on co-morbid depression."

175939764,"Thank you very much for responding.! One of the many things we have tried with him since he was a young boy was doing incentives when he did something he was suppose to do. Many of his therapist have been really big on that. It use to work for a little while when he was younger but since he has gotten older it doesn‚Äôt work anymore. I use to tell him, if you can do your few chores (which was basically clean up after yourself, empty the trash can, gather up your dirty clothes and put them in a basket, go to school like you should for the week) then at the end of the week I would pay for his monthly Xbox live. The following week, it would change to a hour a day on my phone as long as you do what your suppose to do. That worked for 2 days.! I‚Äôm not even joking. He then became very possessive over my phone. He would deny me my phone. He would run off for hours just so I couldn‚Äôt get it. He has broken many of my phones because I‚Äôve taken it away and refused to let him hold it. He has sold 2 of my 
phones because I wouldn‚Äôt let him play on it. Believe me when I say, I‚Äôve and the therapist have tried everything.! I can‚Äôt discipline him because he would go after me. Or he would go after my other kids to get back at me. He has been in DJJ (Department of Juvenile Justice) several times but they won‚Äôt keep him because it‚Äôs Mental Health related. They will hold him there for me to get him away from the family until a placement opens for him to go too. Placements are Mental Health Facilities. Currently where I live we do not have any kind of Mental Hospitals here. We use too until 6-8yrs ago. Or some where around that. I try my best to research everything I can but his therapist are making it hard because they won‚Äôt diagnose him properly. Because of his age. They say they don‚Äôt won‚Äôt to label him right now until he turns 18. That to me is failing him.! That‚Äôs setting him up to nothing but failure, in so many ways.

I did research a long time ago and personally I relate to Depersonalization. I dont feel real or present a lot of the time. The trauma I've been through made it so I automatically turn my ability to sense things off to protect myself. With my flashbacks being more severe these days it has worsened to the point I cant even really realize what anyone is saying when they're talking to me. And with the new trauma it has gotten so extreme that I feel like I can't even fully think anymore. So last night I practiced while on a late night walk (I am staying in a safer neighborhood and it was very quiet) some techniques. I picked a nice spot and started with my hands and wiggled my fingers to connect with my sense of touch, then I did a breathing exercise (6 count in 8 count out), by breathing it slowed things down for me and when things were slowe
d down I looked around me and began listening to the sounds around me, I took down my mask since no one was around and breathed in the cold air while I continued to do these things. And it helped me. Of course I wasn't 100 percent present but I became roughly 30 percent more present. Granted it was my first time in a very long time even trying to be present. The more I will do it the more I will feel real. There's also a noodle exercise to help slow things down and allow the senses to come back. Wherever you are you just begin relaxing every muscle from the face to the feet while breathing deeply and purposefully. It relaxes your system, so I try to do it when I feel very triggered or anxious and start to feel myself slip away from being present. I also look up a lot of videos to help me with feeling present and try any tips they offer. Some of them work and some don't but just the act of trying to be present helps even if the technique isn't perfect. Keep trying to be present slowly (and it is good that it w
ill be slow because you dont want to shock your system) you will get there:)"

175939813,"Around this time 2016, I was in the beginning states of psychosis. There was no point to life, it seemed. After years of loneliness, I experienced spiritual delusions centered around myself, had extremely low tolerance for any, and I mean any, sound, and was beginning to hallucinate. I had isolated myself in my parents basement and had a dream that seemed utterly impossible, of living some day in a beautiful nature desert area in an RV in the peace of nature. I knew I needed that to heal my soul. I had no idea how to get there. I just knew it was my dream. I was way out there, dreaming of things that could never come true- I even prayed for my soulmate! I was in no shape for any of these things to enter my life, I couldn‚Äôt even take care of myself! Yet, it all came true. All of it. And now my dreams for the future have expanded beyond where I could have imagined them to, because of my faith that things will get better, and my faith that dreams do indeed come true. I met my soul mate and we live i
n this beautiful place of my dreams, and every day life seems more beautiful than I could have imagined it the previous day. I was so depressed back then, so lonely and afraid of the world. I had no idea that life gets better. I just wanted it all to end. I cut my wrist and have the scar to prove it. I had no idea that my life was going to get so much better just around the bend. So I learned how to be grateful for everything, even the bad things, because you can never be certain where those experiences will lead us, even if they seem to have nothing positive in them. Sure, it has taken years to become as stable as I am. I didn‚Äôt find the right medication right away. So what? What a learning process! I‚Äôve only just recently found high dose b-vitamins, which are having a hugely positive effect on me. That‚Äôs a brand new improvement! The future is bright! Life is a constant improvement and evolution! Medications in the future will have a much more healing effect on the mind, working on the cognitive sympto
ms as well, but until they do that, I just recently learned that aerobic exercise stimulates growth hormones in the brain, and so I have that to rely on along with b vitamins to help my mind. I went from having hallucinations (of every type), extreme delusions, low motivation, negative and positives, even on medication, to now having minimal of both. I can‚Äôt overstate how little I was functioning before, and now I am seeking responsibility and desiring to add meaning to other people‚Äôs lives. If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. Even just earlier this year I was severely depressed, then I changed medications, I took action and responsibility for myself because I knew I needed help, and it helped so much. Even a year ago, I wasn‚Äôt making art like I wanted, because I couldn‚Äôt focus due to delusions. Now I am trying to make pieces for a gallery! I even won a place in a photography contest for taking a picture of me with face paint to show what it‚Äôs like to have visual hallucinations! So if y
ou dream big, the universe responds big! I am fortunate, but not because of wealth. Because my grateful attitude paints my world with love! I see improvement in my attitude from even a month ago, and have even bigger dreams for the future! When I met my soul mate, I asked him what his dream for life was if he could do anything, and now he is making it happen, even though it is years later! I can‚Äôt even imagine how wonderful the future is, because there is hope. Some times things get worse, but when we learn from that, we grow and then things improve even more! I have been to very low points in my life but more than that, I have had beautiful moments that keep me in hope. I am going to keep hoping, keep living, and keep being grateful, and this is something I hope everyone can learn to do. By the way, I wrote this whole thing while having breakthrough visual hallucinations, and if I can do that, why can‚Äôt we all do something beautiful and worthwhile?"

174337663,"Last time I attended school in person was at a community college from 1990-1995 when I was in my early thirties and living in a board & care home. I had been schizophrenic since 1980. Now I take one online course at a time. I rate attending in person for all those years as a positive experience. I met some friendly people there in my classes and I felt perfectly comfortable having lunch by myself in the cafeteria occasionally. I got mixed grades; some A‚Äôs, B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs and I think I failed one class. But yeah, I walked around and no one gave me a second look. I took academic courses mainly but I also took Physical Education classes and they got pretty fun sometimes. Then I moved out of the group home and rented a room in my sisters condo and concentrated on working. I didn‚Äôt take any more classes again until about 2009. I tried online classes and they worked out fine. Now I prefer them. I mean there are many advantages to distance learning. I can make my own schedule to study when I want to 
in the comfort of my own home. I used to dig sitting at the computer reading an assignment eating a bowl of chocolate pudding with the radio on in the background, in my boxers, and occasionally petting my cat sitting at my feet and the heater on. That‚Äôs why I personally prefer online courses. If I attended in person now at age 58, I doubt the school would let me eat pudding in class so that‚Äôs the main reason I take online classes. Pudding rules. But I still take online classes, in fact my next class starts in about two weeks and I‚Äôm looking forward to it. Attending in person of course, is a good thing in many ways. Socially it‚Äôs better and being physically in a class on a campus is a good environment to be in. It‚Äôs socially healthy to be interacting with people in person for sure. But you just have to weigh the pro‚Äôs and cons of both and make an informed decision."

174337664,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Schizophrenia as a pseudogenetic disease: A call for more gene-environmental studies. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research , Jun 2019 04 In recent years schizophrenia has been assumed to be largely a genetic disease with heritability estimates, derived primarily from family and twin studies, of 80%-85%. However, the results of genetic research on schizophrenia have not yielded results consistent with that estimate of heritability. In particular, extensive genetic studies have not led to new methods for diagnosis and treatment. An examination of the twin studies on which heritability is based shows why such studies exaggerate the genetic component of schizophrenia. In addition, the effects of infectious agents such as Toxoplasma gondii and the composition of the microbiome can produce a clinical picture that would also appear to be largely genetic due to familial aggregation and a role for a partial genetic contribution to the immune system. It is concluded that the genetic co
mponent of schizophrenia may have been overestimated and an increased focus on gene-environmental interactions is likely to accelerate research progress on this disease."

175939924,"You know, having anxiety about it made me post it here xD sorry for the long post Last two years in around September I have had this very strange headache or face pain on left side of my head, Both times started the same way as a tenderness to touch in exact same spot, which is in the inner corner of my left eye and nose bridge bone on that side feels tender. That takes around 1 or half a day then I have quite much pain around left eye, on my cheek bone, temple and also on top of my head on left side. Back of my eye also is painful. The pain feels like a painful burning feeling + dull pain also I noticed a little runny nose on that side and the major thing is I have very slightly droopy and tearing eye. The eye really tears a lot. At first I thought it was an eye infection as I had some dried white residue under my eyelashes in mornings so went to dr got an antibiotic eye salve, after 5-6 days the pain stopped like suddenly. The second year I got the same thing at almost the same month, I thought "
"oh yeah? infection again??"" then went to dr got the same salve but this time it was around 7th day it cut like nothing happened, and then I knew it was not an infection because 7th day was long past the antibiotic salve's treatment period. I asked the dr, but they didn't have any clue but they said apparently nothing sinister. I searched of course the internet, well yes please show mercy, and cluster headaches was one of the possibilities which threw me into insta-panic right there. But then I thought it might not be because even thought the pain was quite bothersome, it was not severe enough to make me bounce my head to walls. Then this year, since the time is near xD I asked my therapist about my anxiety for the possibility. She thinks this sounds like Migraine. but a migraine flare once a year? at the same time?

My symptoms give me a lot more freedom and leeway. Now I can slow down and think and what‚Äôs happening in my life such as employment and taking classes can almost overshadow my illness. I don‚Äôt spend a 100% of the time anymore focusing on just my symptoms. I can think about stuff besides myself, like other people and world events. Part of it is probably due to being 59 years old and older and more mature. Though from what you guys see on here, I guess my ‚Äúma
turity level‚Äù is a matter of opinion, lol. But I can relax now and have peace of mind. Peace of mind is a big one. I craved it ever since I got sick at age 19. Suffice it to say that my first two and years I was barely functioning but now I have a normal life in many ways. I can take care of myself and take care of the responsibility of living mostly independently, holding a job, taking classes, shopping and cooking for myself, driving and all the miscellaneous crap that comes up to live in this world. My life now compared to my first 2 1/2 years is like night and day."

What was said ,knowledge without corresponding reality -Yes The things called hallucination can be described respect to the person who is coexists with it and has going under its effect in two different positions ; 1-the first is the description of the potential status The hallucination as it appears to perception (the thing without generation an action or activity. It is constant perception regard with all people with sz,it does not change,and it represented the basic structure of hallucination OR the existential features OR Current state ,fixed shape OR morphological structure of the hallucination as perceived by the human being . The description is look like the description of the gene structure,the virus,the cell, and the chemical composition of a substance 2- The second,the hallucination in motion state ( the thing in the state of movement ),or the hallucination in the state of Functional Act
ivity or ritual manifestation of the hallucination‚Äôs life cycle as perceived by the human host (like dynamic imagination,voices and new feelings) The question; How the person feels and perceives the hallucination in the two different positions ? 1- In the first position,he feels the hallucination as a living morphological features of a person (s), he perceives them as a whole psychological entities ,he feel their existence as he feels himself , and he does not feel them as a mental symptom of any illness or as a symptom of any organic disease 2- In the second position,the person feels / perceives the functional activity of the hallucination as a integrated perception of dynamic imagination,acoustic thoughts and interfered feelings There are compound scene consisting of ; 1- A visual scene showing the movement of a person(s) in the imagination theater but it appears as if it were occurring in the external environmental world ,followed by 2- listening to vocal thoughts as if it were coming from the external e
nvironment ,followed by 3- A malignant feeling that gives a test of realism / credibility to the concept of the vocal thoughts and the movement action So,when they said "" hallucination,that is, percepts without corresponding stimulus"" the understandable meaning of the phrase‚Äô Thee is a reaction without an action Perception of data content without sensory inputs Perception of acoustic material without a realistic sound source in the surrounding environment Perception of sounds without sound ! Perception of a visible scene without object visible There is perceptual reaction without perceptual influencer / effect A result without cause ! The mistake The description of hallucination is not related the researcher observation ,because it respect to the person‚Äôs perception who is coexists with the hallucination and under its effect"

I realized what it did was, it flipped my unconscious from negative to positive, and it started looking for solutions, not ways to lose.

The mechanisms of these beneficial effects of CBD are unknown. Here, we examined behavioral effects of CBD in a pharmacological model of schizophrenia-like cognitive deficits induced by repeated ketamine (KET) administration. In parallel, we assessed transcriptional changes behind CBD activities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the main brain area linked to schizophrenia-like pathologies. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected for 10 days with KET followed by 6 days of CBD. The cognitive performance was evaluated in the novel object recognition test followed by PFC dissections for n
ext-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis and bioinformatics. We observed that KET-induced learning deficits were rescued by CBD (7.5 mg/kg). Similarly, CBD reversed transcriptional changes induced by KET. The majority of the genes affected by KET and KET-CBD were allocated to astroglial and microglial cells and associated with immune-like processes mediating synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity. These genes include C1qc, C1qa, C1qb, C2, and C3 complement cascade elements, Irf8 factor and Gpr84, Gpr34, Cx3cr1, P2ry12, and P2ry6 receptors. The main pathway regulators predicted to be involved included TGF?1 and IFN?. In addition, CBD itself upregulated oxytocin mRNA in the PFC. The present data suggest that KET induces cognitive deficits and transcriptional changes in the PFC and that both effects are sensitive to a reversal by CBD treatment. In this study they used 7.5 mg/kg in adult rats who were given ketamine (not a neurodevelopmental model)."

It‚Äôs a slow recovery but if this disease truly did permanent damage to me, I figure I‚Äôd be a vegetable right now."
175939998,"This virus makes me really scared. So, non-medic fool that I am I tried to think of a cure. It came originally from Bats, like SARS and Ebola. There are a lot of bats. They are the most populous mammal and they fly of course so they can spread their pathogens. It is not their fault but thinking about bats made me come up with a couple of ideas that I will use on myself perhaps, though I am not a medic or related to medicine in anyway. Bats have a weak immune system. This is another reason why there are a lot of viruses from bats. They have a weak immune system because they don‚Äôt want to turn their immune system on their own damaged cells since they damage themselves quite a lot by the tremendous exertion they perform in flight. Instead of the usual use of a lot of macrophages, or whatever, to attack broken or foreign cells, they use heat to kill pathogens because when they fly they get very hot to about 41 Celsius or nearly 106 Fahrenheit. There is a ‚Äúflight as fever‚Äù hypothesis that suggests 
that bats use this high temperature that they get to while flying instead of an immune system. There is some contrary evidence (some types of bat viruses are not killed by heat) but the theory does explain why bats are not killed by the viruses that kill despite their low-key immune system. Hence, idea 1 ‚Äì thermotherapy: it might help to heat yourself up. This is an ancient type of therapy. The Japanese have been into it forever. The ancient Romans and everyone who was into hot baths spoke of them as cures but these days we generally take ‚Äúanti-pyretics‚Äù drugs such as ibuprofen to reduce our temperature when it gets above 38 or so. Actually I did not get this idea from bats but rather from looking at the ways in which people attempted to cure the flu of 1918. More than one naturalist said get patients to sit in a foot bath while cooling the infected parts. Foot baths are being used in Wuhan as preventative traditional medicine and my town here in Yamaguchi is big on foot baths, with their being several 
public foot baths using natural hot spring water. At first I thought it a silly idea but then raising ones temperature while chilling the infected areas might be a good idea. The 1918 flu was a swine flu and resulted in fever. Pigs have a normal body temperature of 38 and fever of 40. The current virus tends to result in a low level of fever in humans, and perhaps also in bats, but as mentioned above, bats as mentioned above raise their body temperature to 41 Celsius when they fly. If you get the corona virus, raising your body temperature may be very bad for you. It may kill you for all I know. But if I can‚Äôt get to a doctor, I think I will try sleeping with some sort of heat pad to raise my temperature. But why not a foot bath? That brings me to idea number 2. This is my idea so it is probably completely batty. Bats live upside down. Bats live upside down so when they get viral infections of the lungs they may not need to cough. I search YouTube for a videos of a bats coughing. I could not find one. There 
are videos of snakes coughing but no bats. The only video I could find is of a bat being scared of a human coughing. Perhaps bats find coughing so weird that they associated it with bat predators like monkeys. I asked some of the video producers ‚Äì bat carers-- and they said, ‚Äúyeah‚Ä¶bats clear their throats but they don‚Äôt seem to cough, not fruit bats anyway‚Äù. So I figure, though I am in NO way an expert on bats either, that when bats get a virus, they don‚Äôt cough up the mucus, but rely on gravity to let it fall out. And on the part of the virus, it does not need to make bats (or humans) cough to ensure that it is spread, because it will fall out of the mouths of bats who sleep huddling together. And, this current virus tends (though not all) to be characterised by a dry cough, or even almost no cough at all, just having your lungs fill up with fluid. So, to get rid of it, if I get this disease, I am thinking I will try sleeping a bit like a bat ‚Äì with my lungs higher than my mouth. Perhaps I will 
just put some pillows under my pelvis, or perhaps I will try sloping my bed. This position, the ‚ÄúTrendelenburg position‚Äù was used in operations and nursing in the past but fell out of favour. A head down position is bad for people who have head wounds (due to increased bleeding from head), eye pathologies (due to higher eyeball pressure) and people who are overweight (their organs fall on their diaphragm) but other research suggests that a head lower position can help to clear mucus from the lungs in some situations. Maybe it is bad for you or can kill you if you get this virus, but I am going to try sleeping in bat pose, with an electric blanked on my feet, if I can‚Äôt get to a hospital. (It takes quite a long time to cure. Hospitals may get clogged up.) And so, even if useless, or bad for me, rather than wait for my lungs to fill up, I can try the above. This made me feel a bit better. But that is not really why I am scared. I am scared it is all part of a big plot or worse. I note that this virus enco
urages people, everybody, to look at or pay attention to their hands because the main route of transmission is getting other people‚Äôs cough, sneeze etc on your hands and then wiping your own face. It is important to avoid touching our face ‚Äì eyes nose and mouth. I have a thing about hands. C.f. pans on hands."

174337704,"Last night I finally told my boyfriend about me. All about my schizoaffective and PTSD, the trauma I‚Äôd been through. He was very supportive and loving just like I thought he would be. I was just so nervous because when we went on our first or second date he said he didnt think he could date someone with schizoaffective because of a mutual friend we had who had it whose episodes he‚Äôd supported her through before. I reminded him of this and he said ‚ÄúWell I am dating you‚Äù. He told me he loved me no matter what and he wanted to be there for me through all my troubles and held me. I told him I hadn‚Äôt had a major episode in years and he said it didnt matter even if I was still having episodes he‚Äôd be there for me. Basically he was just perfect. I was crying and everything.

175940064,Virtual therapy with my psychologist today. I‚Äôve been doing well but found myself crying a couple times during the session thinking about how I‚Äôve been so shy and hate being the center of attention. But I‚Äôm fine now I‚Äôve been coping quite well with working from home and not going anywhere. One of the things that came up in my line of thinking was shyness and social anxiety and psychosis if they are somehow all connected. Like what if some of my social anxiety early on feeling embarrassed and nervous people watching me was an early sign of psychotic thinking. It‚Äôs an interesting thought.
175940065,The one I found is in a hospital. It‚Äôs the hospital they send some patients to after they enter the ER. Does that sound right?
175940066,Thanks! How are you today?

175940072,"I looked into continuing therapy after my sessions became too much of a burden on the UK public health system. Unfortunately, I was turned away by one charity because their referral list was months long, another they sent me an invite for a virtual assessment that they never turned up to it or responded to me and the local Mind charity is shut due to Covid and now are de-prioritising people who‚Äôre accessing secondary health care (UK Mental health) so I don‚Äôt even speak to them on the phone one to one any more. I cannot afford to go private It just feels like to me that there are so many unresolved issues. A lot of it is due to my communication with the therapist I am guessing, but not sure who‚Äôs to blame here. I just had such high hopes for therapy as I was told it was a long term project that would take time. Now I have a useless second diagnosis and not any further ahead than when I started. The psychologist even had the cheek to open her treatment summary letter listing just how many sessi
ons I had. She missed the point that half were on the phone due to Covid, and the others were not helpful at all to me All we did was work on healthy routines and worry - and that‚Äôs about it. We did not even talk about trauma, and there was a massive amount of work we could have done there. The above is why I have just given up trying with this now. I have my business, and work I enjoy, so I just need to take my pills and get on with things. All this therapy stuff seems to be a real waste of time here as the therapists in public health are clock watchers"

175940082,"Temptation to come off meds can be over powering, but you need to understand that you‚Äôre no use to anyone psychotic, or even more psychotic than you may already be. That‚Äôs why we take meds, to silence these thoughts and hallucinations. They really have no value or add anything to your life to warrant having them full blown - there are relatively effective drugs on the market. I believe all sorts of things everyday that many may feel are crazy, but it‚Äôs no where near as intense because I take my meds.

174337724,"All right. I think we can decide with pretty much certainty that this is better classified as thought insertion than just intrusive thoughts.

Children with little genetic risk raised in families with high levels of environmental risk factors do not have a much increased risk of developing sz. It takes both kinds of risk, genetic and environmental, for the total increased risk to be large. The point is that this absence of large purely genetic effects does not mean sz is any more of a psychological condition. Also, the heritability estimates were not wrong, like the article says, it was the assumption that the causes of these heritability estimates were purely genetic that was wrong. There are different kinds of heritability estimates, and they all to some degree confound environmental and genetic effects, and especially interactions between these effects."

I even have a hard time wanting to shave my legs, arm pits, and since I deal with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), which causes me to have hair on my face, chest, and stomach, I have to shaves those areas too. This also depresses me. At least now that we have to wear masks wherever I go, I don't have to shave my face as often, since no one can see the hair. Some might say, ""just go a day with out showering"", for me I can't do that. I will say to myself, ""you didn't anything, so why take one"", i might skip it. Then I'll ask myself the same thing, ""why take one, you didn't do anything"". So I'll go another day without a shower. Then it will just become a habit I don't want to do. To me, not taking a shower is a sign that I have given up. I don't want to give up. I'll just continue to push myself to take a shower even if it does feel like a chore."

I have a doctor appointment next week. I‚Äôm scared because lately my head is aching from my neck to the top of my ears, sometimes I got migraine too. Took Tylenol it will go away for a bit but came again. I will ask my doctor if I can get an X-ray for my neck to my brain. I have a brother who passed away from a brain tumor. He never complained for a very severe head ache but he mentioned he‚Äôs having a head aches but tolerable. I‚Äôm scared that I will end like him. Praying this is just an anxiety.

I‚Äôve had a couple lately that surprised me but I thought about them for a minute and moved on. Many schizophrenics suffer from this exact thing. You have nothing to do with events around the world. People aren‚Äôt dying because of you. It‚Äôs a harsh world and terrible stuff is going to happen somewhere at any time, somewhere in the world and it has nothing to do with me or you. If we had never been born the world would still be a messed up place and it will be a messed up place after we‚Äôre gone. I don‚Äôt know much about young people getting schizophrenia. I know that their delusions or hallucinations can be just like adults but I‚Äôm not a 100% positive whether to give an adolescent medication is a good idea. I have read many, many times though that the sooner someone is diagnosed and treated, the better their prognosis. Discuss

Just as an example though. I‚Äôve had that trash can for 5 years‚Ä¶ at least. Not once have I ever let any of that long term ???? accumulate under the bottom bag. How did I pull that off you ask? I don‚Äôt let the bag slip‚Ä¶ boom easy‚Ä¶ requires almost no thinking at all. Just takes concern when tossing ???? in. Anyways that‚Äôs just chumpy annoyances on to
p of the real stuff. Someone let my cat out‚Ä¶ They weren‚Äôt inclined to care. They were just going to act like it didn‚Äôt happen‚Ä¶ I had the choice to get on them about it. It‚Äôs just such thick ???????? to be the one to start conflict. Obviously‚Ä¶ the ??????? should show more concern for my pets. Still‚Ä¶ if I go at harassing them‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll try to shake the accountability. Totally undermining what all I‚Äôve done for them in letting them stay here. Just keep dicking off behind a beer or a bowl of pot. Those ??????? are lousy. There is pretty self-evident reasoning as to why they won‚Äôt be getting anywhere in life. That‚Äôs all they do. Complain about others, shrug off the importance of things‚Ä¶ and otherwise flounder in whatever ???????? they‚Äôve wound up in. TLDR: Woke up to my pet missing, The smell of tobacco and pot filling my room. The hot water heater got shut off at some point‚Ä¶ and my laundry machine has been so over used that it sprung a leak (and I‚Äôm no longer allowed to use it.) Bey
ond the typical inconveniences of just having to share space with people. Just personality conflicts and the like‚Ä¶ Got a perfect storm of my life coming apart at the seams. (And none of it is my fault‚Ä¶ except if I mention it‚Ä¶ then whatever ensues conversation wise is my fault.) I can‚Äôt wait to get into my own space. It‚Äôs the only thing I could think of to find comfort here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to start storing things at my mothers. I‚Äôm going to set it up‚Ä¶ the day‚Ä¶ the first day that is viably functional and sensible for me to move. I‚Äôm going to be out of here within 5 hours time. (I‚Äôll just let that speak for itself when the time comes that they‚Äôre all stuck sorting out their p‚Äôs and q‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I will sit there and just shrug off thinking about any of it all. Just do the bare minimum of making sure they actually do mover out of here on time. I am the one legally accountable. Still stuck have to manage making sure my ass is covered.)"

174337790,Nope. It says Future studies are required to determine if this is due to antipsychotic treatment or is intrinsic to schizophrenia.
175940386,Yes a different doctor and I hope to come off in 5 years depending on what the diagnosis actually is‚Ä¶ 5 years is a long time‚Ä¶ and I think i am being sensible if I do it with their approval again. if they say no i won‚Äôt do it obviously

175940391,"One time I woke to find my slippers had been taken, later in the day I saw this crazy girl wearing them I started to walk over to her to ask for them back and she jumped out of them and ran away. This girl attacked a dude that she slept with because he hit on another girl later. This girl had to be restrained and put in solitary because she was so violent but when I stepped to her to get my slippers she ran. I thought damn I must look pretty scary. It really changed the way I viewed myself. But I felt safe knowing the mean girl was afraid of me. And no one messed with me. The old ex druggie dude that sort of controlled what was going on in the day room took me under his wing and got me introduced to all the guys in there. They were less drama then the girls. When I left I had the man that was giving me a ride swing by _PERSON_ and pick up some clothes for the old ex druggie so he would have something to wear, he only had ward clothes that didn‚Äôt fit him well and I wanted him to have something nic
e for when he got out. I also left a pack of smokes for this other dude who was obsessed about where he was going to get a smoke when he got out and I got hugs and kiss when I left."
175940392,be prepared just in case he ever shows up again what you will do.
175940393,That‚Äôs tons of supplements! Just be careful about their interactions with meds. Lithium can damage the kidneys at therapeutical levels and doctors do regular blood tests for it. Lithium is for bipolar disorder.

I'll just ignore this and smoke a bit more weed and try to do something productive. I wish I was happy and this would be a lot easier but I'm tapering phenibut. It seems that any time I try to taper a drug, something stupid happens. But I'm ok now. They're just talking. I'm not really in the right mind to judge, exist properly because I think reality in general (Or at least my reality - Especially my bad trip) is a form of trauma. ""Every time I start to feel better, some stupid ******** happens"" is what I was saying when I had that meltdown on the front lawn. And my mom is ****ing weird. My dad tells me things about her that I don't realize and all of the ****ing politics of the world ties into it and the ****ing arguing, social media, virus, people dying, the conspiracy people I talked to, what ever is real, the future. My mind is absolutely tr

175940408,"Hi everyone, I feel pretty sane: don‚Äôt hear voices, feel no anger and my depression subsided to a mild one. But I think I have traumatized someone or got traumatized as a child. Why? Because I got heavily bullied at school for no apparent reason (besides my finger hair) so this is my theory, please tell me if this sounds true and if I should do something: When I was a child I was somehow becoming sexual not according to my age - just from being 6 year old I started rubbing my genitals to the point it was consistently chafed even erections. I remember I was frantic and I couldn‚Äôt speak much (started speaking really late). I was raped by my father and I also raped as a child another neighbours girl that I had to change schools and move to the countryside. I stopped talking, got social anxiety. My father died mysteriously somehow and after that I started having a better but stable life"

175940419,"A bad self-control for me is due the Sz itself more than my meds. My experience is that my brains are not in my own use in the same way as in the pre-sz times.

Free will is probably a lot bigger for the healthy people, but yeah - I can co sign, that _PERSON_‚Äôs can‚Äôt be in the charge the same way they used to. It‚Äôs like some outside force makes it hard to not drink beer or smoke cigs. Some meds just boost the addictions even bigger though.

175940425,"If you feel unsafe with yourself at home, the hospital can help. But if you just started meds, my prediction is they will just send you home and tell you to give your meds more time to work. If you‚Äôre feeling unsafe around yourself or others, the hospital is a great place to stay until you stabilize. But you already seem fairly stable, so it might be a good idea to just wait and give the meds a few weeks to kick in. Are you taking your Geodon with at least 500 calories?"

174337799,"I think that you can sometimes use supplements to help with negative symptoms along with your meds. I personally found Lions Mane supplements to help with my anxiety, pain, and general mood. I bought mine from RealMushrooms on Amazon. Others use an extract of Lions Mane called Amyloban. It‚Äôs rather expensive while what I bought was only $21 a months supply and worked well. However, you may not respond to it. Some do and have great results while others feel nothing or feel awful. It is worth a try. But never stop your meds. Ask to try a different kind, but don‚Äôt go off. Psychosis isn‚Äôt worth it. I had bad negatives and side effects on Invega.

175940496,Is there a cheaper way you could get your nicotine?
175940497,"IDK. Just thinking about my high school days. I was nothing special, very shy but I was smart. But yeah, people ignored me and that was actually just fine with me though I do like a little drama and attention now. But thinking back to the popular people I went to school with and I could just imagine the pressure of being popular and setting yourself up as above everyone else. For some reason this one particular guy popped into my head a few minutes ago. He was a good looking guy and had a really cute girlfriend and he was also starting quarterback for the football team. I had him in a couple of my classes and he was always the center of attention. I couldn‚Äôt imagine being under that kind of scrutiny at that age. If anyone saw the Breakfast Club maybe you might remember the popular girl _NAME_ breaking down and crying when she tells the rest of them how hard it is to be popular and having to ignore people and be mean to be that popular and follow whatever the rest of the popular kids said and did. 
I can appreciate that. I forget that guys name. I was never a hateful person but I hated the popular kids a little. I knew they could probably destroy me with one word back then. I appreciate the difficulty of setting yourself up to be known and at the top and I‚Äôm sure those bast ards felt a little bad at all the people they hurt but I‚Äôm sure those bast ards handily forgot about making peoples lives miserable when they were at the head cheerleaders house after school having sex with her on their parents bed."

175940534,I have found that you really can‚Äôt declare your libido truly gone until you are dead (with the exception of course of injury to that area) although you can have a serious decline as you get older due to aging. I could go years without an event and then have one and then have a second event shortly afterwards followed by another dry spell. You don‚Äôt really know when it‚Äôs truly shut down. Latuda even made it a constant thing briefly after a long time of being very weak (even though that drug was screwing me over in other ways that was a reason I was reluctant to quit it as it made me feel the most like a real man.) I used to worry about it and although it‚Äôs still not what it used to be and the female voices rarely show interest anymore (for me it‚Äôs been in my head. It‚Äôs never really happened in reality) but then on a rare day they do. Such is life.

Let me back up: I did take it in when it was brand new. But it‚Äôs not my cup of tea! I received a ‚Äòpenetrating gaze‚Äô from someone who commands respect. For the layperson out there, it‚Äôs a fictional story where a dude hurts women. There‚Äôs a scene where he even throws a chain saw down a stairwell and ‚Äògets someone‚Äô in doing so.

174337843,Worsening OCD usually means your cognition getting worse so never stick with drugs which worsens OCD. You should definitely try phosphatidylserine soy version quickly if you are serious about reducing OCD symptoms. It basically improves your working memory which is the main reason for OCD.

175940619,I wasn‚Äôt so much bullied as I was shunned. People weren‚Äôt actively mean to me because I was pretty and nice but I was very strange because I was actively psychotic most of highschool so people were pleasant to my face but sort of avoided me when possible. My friend told me later when I became more lucid and normal passing that he thought I had mental problems.
175940620,Because even though I‚Äôm still young I‚Äôm fat and ugly and I stink. Plus I‚Äôm stupid and was diagnosed with schizophrenia then schizoaffective disorder so no woman would ever want to be with me because of these things.

This doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs not true. No one is after you. You are not a terrorist. When you get those thoughts, say the word stop. My old therapist used to tell me to say the word stop out loud and then do math problems in my head until I wasn‚Äôt obsessing anymore. It really does help."

174337862,_AT_MENTION_. I get what you mean. I dont like being schizophrenic - but its part of me now? Take that away - then what am I? In a strange sorta way - im proud of it. If i can deal with sz - then i can deal with anything - and not many people can say that. Its proven my strength of character.
175940650,Hope you have a relaxing weekend _PERSON_
175940651,Dreaming don‚Äôt hurt. Dreaming didn‚Äôt cause me to be hospitalized 10 times.
175940652,I too think your a great person. You‚Äôve done some great things in life and sz makes you second guess yourself when you don‚Äôt need too. Your a good egg so chin up and keep trying for better function. It‚Äôs easy to fall into bad habits. Keep things positive and try one positive thing a day. Your worth the effort _AT_MENTION_ !

Add to that I have a pad Thai to use by the 10th. Something doesn‚Äôt add up here! Truth is I shouldn‚Äôt have got the sausages out of the freezer. I‚Äôve ended up chucking the rest of the sausages, and I‚Äôm still struggling as to how to fit all the rest of the food in within the allotted time.

175940664,"The Bottom Line Antipsychotic switching, notably to aripiprazole or ziprasidone, may lead to weight loss, while switching to olanzapine or clozapine can worsen cardiometabolic status. However, clinicians should note that antipsychotic switching is only one strategy to mitigate adverse cardiometabolic effects of antipsychotics. Other options include adjunctive medications such as metformin or statins, as well as dietary and lifestyle interventions. Furthermore, the cardiometabolic profile of both the pre- and post-switch antipsychotic, as well as patient preferences and factors, must be considered in clinical decision-making."

I don‚Äôt find it boring and the job requires some thinking. I have had some problems with my illness but it has not made me lose my job. For one, I am not so great with socializing. It may depend on how bad your symptoms are. You may have to take a job you don‚Äôt think is your top choice. I was helped by a job coach for the mentally ill."

175940671,"Hi _PERSON_, I think a lot of us are experiencing more anxiety due to current events. Political and virus wise. Have you tried mindfulness or meditation. I often get racing thoughts at night so I meditate. I work on mindfulness all of the time. It keeps your mind occupied so you don't think of things that make you anxious. I would talk to your doc about what is going on. Though it sounds in a way like things may be leveling if things are down to a dull roar. There is nothing wrong about trying to increase your med to see if it helps. If the doc goes for it. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I hope that things get better. Hugs, _NAME_..."

Meds negatively changed my energy level, personality, metabolism, hormones, brain, weight, etc. I think it is naive to think they dont harm. Of course they do.

174337853,"I started exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia a few months ago. I‚Äôm going to have to go tell a psychiatrist that this is happening and start experimenting with medications. I‚Äôm scared out of my mind. I heard voices in my head telling me that a small percentage of the human population is psychic and I‚Äôm one of them. It‚Äôs all very cliche schizophrenia stuff, but as you‚Äôre aware it feels real to you in the moment. It didn‚Äôt occur to me that this was a delusion for quite a while. I lived with psychic voices as my constant companions, thinking it was all real and living a life of delusion. I said weird crap to some members of my family and friends. It‚Äôs all very humiliating in retrospect. Finally, I broke out of it when I realized that the psychic voices can‚Äôt actually do anything IRL. I challenged a psychic to email me, to text me and to my horror none of them would. I realized suddenly, that none of it is real and that I might just be hearing voices. I went through a mourning process 
together with the voices. They thought they were real. They didn‚Äôt want to believe me at first, and then I felt their existential dread as they realize that they are just disembodied voices in my mind. They have their own memories and personalities, and they thought their lives were real. I used to have cheerful conversations with them and enjoy their company. Now, I feel like we‚Äôre a confederation of dunces. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are we going to do about this?‚Äù They don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not tied up with them like I used to be. They used to ease my loneliness. Now I realize this is a life-changing event and I will probably be even more isolated and lonely than before. How do you find acceptance with this terrible mental illness?"

I hope he understands.. My psychiatrist said that it's no problem to prescribe 1-2 short acting dex in the evening - Cuz I go to sleep at like 12-1am so... He just judges me though. Every other doctor treats me like I'm some sort of genius - But they never trust that I know which meds I need and like to be in control while my current doctor lets me have control. It's odd.

He was on 5mg Loxepine and can't tolerate low dose antipsychotics cuz he was born with no immune system and takes injections for that. I told him about psychedelics and antipsychotics and that he should only be on a low dose. He said it would be much better if he was my age and was on an antipsychotic inj

175940727,"Hi friends. I‚Äôd like to reach out today for help. I rarely post about my own ongoings, but I need to reach out today and hope you may provide help. Recently, I had a stay at the psych hospital for excessive marijuana use. I went, detoxed, and was discharged after five days. That was four days ago. Since arriving home, I‚Äôve experienced concerning sleep disturbances. The first few nights at home, I had trouble catching my breath trying to fall asleep-- very scary and alarming. I then went and saw my MD and was prescribed a sleeping aid. The first night with the sleep aid I slept, not great sleep but enough to say whew- I may get through this yet. Last night, I was optimistic of getting a good night‚Äôs rest. Instead, I ruminated all night and felt trapped in my head. Again, cause for alarm. In the past seven days, I‚Äôve had about 10 hours of sleep. A couple points to note: I changed my AP while inpatient. I was on Zyprexa for a good 15 years. My pdoc and I decided to try a new med, he prescribed 
Geodon, 40mg. I have sleep apnea that is mitigated with a cpap machine. I take Trazadone 50mg as a sleep aid. Sleep is important for us all; going without it is poor for overall health, anxiety filled, panicky at times, and potentially dangerous (auto accident, thoughts of self harm). Thanks in advance for your input. -gene"

The Accounting Clerk isn‚Äôt a full-time job, and I would still be dependent on my SSDI pay. Plus social security could say that I‚Äôm working and therefore no longer disabled and cutoff my benefits.

And work, no matter how small, day after day after day, slowly drives me up a wall until I have an episode due to stress. Even though I don‚Äôt necessarily feel super stressed by that particular work, the stress of ‚Äúwork‚Äù in general and my paranoia over running out of time make it unbearable.

An unexpected finding was an order effect, whereby subjects who received D-cycloserine first had significantly reduced delusional severity, distress, and belief conviction on PSYRATS compared to subjects who received placebo first. However, this finding is consistent with animal models in which D-cycloserine enhances learning only when accompanying the first exposure to training. In this experiment they used 50mg of D-cycloserine once a week prior to CBT for delusions."

174337889,"# Advances in schizophrenia research: glycobiology, white matter abnormalities, and their interactions In April 2020, we published a special issue on schizophrenia, with multiple articles of considerable conceptual novelty and impact [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. As we finish this 25th volume of Molecular Psychiatry , we have in this issue four exciting new papers that address two crucial and inter-related directions in schizophrenia research, namely glycosylation and white matter changes. In a Perspective article, _PERSON_ point out that the role of glycosylation in schizophrenia has been emerging from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [20]. They discuss the findings that the most robust coding variant in schizophrenia GWAS is a missense mutation in the manganese transporter gene solute carrier family 39 member 8( SLC39A8 ), which is associated with altered glycosylation patterns in humans, and variants near several genes encoding glycosylation enzymes are unambiguously a
ssociated with schizophrenia. Those include the fucosyltransferase 9 ( FUT9 ), alpha-mannosidase 2 ( MAN2A1 ), transmembrane O-mannosyltransferase targeting cadherins 1 ( TMTC1 ), polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 10 ( GALNT10 ), and 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase 1 ( B3GAT1 ) genes. In this interesting perspective/hypothesis paper, the authors summarized the known biological functions, target substrates, and expression patterns of these enzymes as primers for future studies. They also highlighted a subset of schizophrenia-associated proteins critically modified by glycosylation including glutamate receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels, the dopamine D2 receptor, and complement glycoproteins. Their central hypothesis is that common genetic variants alter brain glycosylation and play a fundamental role in the development of schizophrenia. Aberrant glycosylation in schizophrenia was also the topic of a review of 25 years of post-mortem brain studies by _NAME_. [21]. They point out the same observ
ation noted by _PERSON_ et al. [20] that there is recent evidence for the association of several enzymes of glycosylation with schizophrenia by GWAS, which shows the importance of glycosylation in this disease. _NAME_ et al. then review studies conducted over the past 25 years, analyzing post-mortem brain samples, which have found evidence of aberrant glycosylation in individuals with schizophrenia. Those findings underline the role of proteins involved in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission display altered glycans in the disease state, including ?-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptor subunits, glutamate transporters excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and 2 (EAAT1 and EAAT2), and the ?-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor. Polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) and perineuronal nets, highly glycosylated molecules critical for axonal migration and synaptic stabilization, which are downregulated in multiple brain regions of individuals with schizophrenia. They als
o show that, additionally, enzymes spanning several pathways of glycan synthesis exhibit differential expression in brains of individuals with schizophrenia. These changes may be due to genetic predisposition, environmental perturbations, medication use, or a combination of these factors. Enhancing our understanding of how glycosylation is dysregulated in the brain will make it possible for us to fully ascertain its role in the development and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The connection between glucose, cognition, and white matter (WM) was the topic of an exciting study conducted by _PERSON_. that simultaneously examined glucose disturbances, cognitive deficits and WM abnormalities in first-episode drug-naive schizophrenia [22]. First, it is very important that they were able to conduct their study at the pre-treatment stage, thereby avoiding the confounding factor of the effects of antipsychotics on glucose metabolism. Having obtained such a critical group of drug-na√Øve patients, they showed that abnor
mal glucose metabolism, cognitive impairment and widespread disruption of WM structure occurs early in the course of schizophrenia, and is demonstrable at the onset. They conclude that interactions between glucose metabolism abnormality and WM dysconnectivity may lead to cognitive impairment. Because this study examines a sample at the onset of illness, the question then arises: how do these alterations in critical pathways evolve during the course of schizophrenia? The WM component of that important question is answered by _PERSON_ et al. in a large multicenter study involving 13 centers in North America, Europe and Asia [23]. The authors determined the pattern of age-related fractional anisotropy (FA) changes by cross-sectionally assessing the timing of the structural neuropathology associated with schizophrenia. Quadratic curves were used to model between-group FA differences across whole-brain white matter and fiber tracts at each age; fiber tracts were then clustered according to both the effect-sizes an
d pattern of lifespan white matter FA differences. They found that in whole-brain white matter, FA was significantly lower across the lifespan and reached peak maturation younger in patients compared to controls. Additionally, they demonstrated that three distinct patterns of neuropathology emerged when investigating white matter fiber tracts in patients: (1) developmental abnormalities in limbic fibers, (2) accelerated aging and abnormal maturation in long-range association fibers, (3) severe developmental abnormalities and accelerated aging in callosal fibers. The authors concluded by suggesting that these findings indicate that white matter in schizophrenia is affected across entire stages of the disease and that white matter alterations in schizophrenia involve dynamic interactions between neuropathological processes in a tract-specific manner. It is remarkable that these four outstanding papers provide an in-depth understanding of both glycobiology [20, 21], white matter abnormalities [23], well as well 
as their interactions in schizophrenia [22]. In future issues, Molecular Psychiatry will continue to publish outstanding advances in schizophrenia research."

It‚Äôs a process to go through, and I look back with no regrets. Having to find another place to work is hard, but not impossible. It doesn‚Äôt have to be work.

He told a couple people he thought he could trust at work and well, news travels fast. HR put him on leave until he can be released to work from a mental health professional. I cussed him out when he first told me. I see no logical reason for telling anybody about my diagnoses. Why would I? What purpose would it serve? Awww maybe to ‚Äòmake me feelllll better.‚Äô Next we could all join hands and sing a song together‚Ä¶! Yeah right. Well, he shared his personal business and it caused a chain reaction that has pretty much forced him into getting help, and for that, I am thankful. So I guess they‚Äôre right, everything happens for a reason. He wouldn‚Äôt have went if not forced to. I told him he ought to be glad he isn‚Äôt married to me yet, would‚Äôve had his butt involuntarily admitted. We both started getting symptoms nearly three years ago 
because of all the meth we were doing. I was the first to seek treatment, the hospital referred me to the same crisis center he is in now and they started me on Zyprexa, which helped tremendously and helped me screw my head back on right! My fiance was hell bent on NOT taking any medications, thought is was all a part of ‚Äòtheir plan,‚Äô thankfully everything happened the way it did and he is taking _PERSON_ at a low milligram level! I personally do not want him on any of the older anti psychotics because they are more likely to cause the disorder, tardive dyskinesia. From what I‚Äôve read, the newer neuroleptic drugs are less likely. How effective has Respidol been to whoever is taking it? How long did it take for schizophrenic symptoms to lessen? Did it cause the tardive disorder?"

They might get influenced by movies where mentally ill often is portrayed as being stir crazy, being randomly violent or being a psychopath.

175940817,"Hi, Im new to this group. I have anxiety attacks on and off for years. Though its not frequent and others may consider my situation still mild. I don't use any medicines and rely with the natural way of dealing with it. But even i had it for quite some time and most of the time I know what I should do the situation is not always the same and it still puzzles me why I suddenly feel the anxiety again and why I cannot control it. Even if i don't have a serious personal problem, I'm not stress from work I exercise regularly but anxiety attack just happens. My anxiety attacks mostly at night when I cannot control my random thoughts making me sleepless but even if I try those breathing exercise, yoga, meditation..its still happening, though I know once you have the anxiety and you just started again those things it may take time to get again to the rhythm of it.. but do you have any other suggestion. I'm afraid of taking medication and would like to try first if you have any other effective tips to relie

Moved two more times, once to the house across the street from my parent‚Äôs house, (washing my dishes in the kitchen, I looked right into the kitchen of my parents house- just the opposite growing up- talk about a mind shift), and the last time being in the house I‚Äôm in now, for 26 years.

175940832,There‚Äôs a couple different ways to do it but it all is based off of left and right and calming your brain. The way we do it is with some little buzzy devices one in each hand and the buzzes alternate. It‚Äôs supposed to help calm you and process stuff like trauma and anxiety. Since COVID we‚Äôve had to do video calling so we do alternating arm tapping. I‚Äôm not quite sure how to describe it. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing - Wikipedia

I liken it to like fairies or sprites rather than angels and demons because it seems the condition itself is clever and tricks me. It held me back to be honest and now that I‚Äôm more fully sane the family thing is happening. They won‚Äôt castrate you these days, the meds can make sex a little harder at first in the bedroom but it‚Äôs easier to get into relationships when you can relate a little more to neurotypicals. I‚Äôve tried several meds, they all have their downsides, but now I‚Äôm on aristada which is the injection for abilify. It really has done wonders for me. As for the telepathy you‚Äôre right, I do believe there is an underlying subconscious language we use but knowing it is kinda painful and I prefer not to necessarily live in ignorance of it but rather to not be held down by it.

I don‚Äôt think very many of us fall evenly into categories. I think nobody really knows WHY we are the way we are, and they don‚Äôt know WHY certain treatments work better than others. I felt a lot of identity crisis when I was first diagnosed with schizophrenia, and again when they took it away. It is confusing, especially because we have built this community where we fit in based on that identity and diagnosis. But the diagnosis isn‚Äôt what makes you belong here. You belong here because of your experiences. No word on an insurance form is ever going to erase your experiences. You know what it is like to be out of control of your own actions. You know what it is like to have to question your own judgment and perception. The word they gi

I couldnt feel sad, touched, or really happy. When i withdrew i got psychosis and mood swings and had to start antipsychotics.

175940860,I dunno it could be ptsd. But there are a few events I relive in my head almost every day. Some weren‚Äôt traumatic per say. But definitely made a huge impact on my life.

I dunno if this one guy is even alive for all I know‚Ä¶but I remember 3-4 things he said to/or about me. I always hear his voice in my head saying the same 3 phrases. When I had a bad lsd trip and my friend says ‚Äúyour ego‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI know!!‚Äù I always relive in my head. I always look in the mirror and say out loud ‚ÄúI know!!!‚Äù For some reason to try to get a better idea of what happened. Also from childhood I still have memories of my worst trauma. I think about it a lot. Not so much the implications anymore but I relive the event In my head.
175940861,"My anxiety got really bad after my relapse too. But what initially did it for me was realizing that I had turned 40 and the volunteer, and minimum wage jobs had gotten me absolutely nothing in life. (of course I was not allowed to drive which maximized that effect) and sadly going off work actually gave me access to benefits like food stamps (which supposedly were always available but not obtained until I went off work), my own apartment, a case manager (I was told that working made me ineligible), more transportation (when my Mom called a guy who was a part of one of those services he rejected her saying he was tired of bringing people to work), a phone, and more SSI money. (also the amount of assets you were allowed to have in order to keep your health insurance were the same whether you worked or not). It was wrong to be bedazzled by that crap but I was. Another factor was a weight gain that eventually reached 180 pounds. (from 170 to 350) that messed up my feet, and made it difficult to functio

Then this morning I emailed them again and told them to cancel publication. Because I was scared I‚Äôd make enemies who‚Äôd come kill me or my husband. Then in mosque it blew out of proportion. I saw two young guys come into ladies section and sit behind screen. I developed a severe bout of paranoia as I believed these two men had guns and we‚Äôre part of a gang sent to shoot us. The imam was talking in his sermon about rapes and killings and it crossed my mind he was probably in the plot too. I was terrified and cried a lot to God. I almost got up and left before prayers began. Wtf is wrong with me??? On top of that Alien spoke to me saying I must get out and leave and when I didn‚Äôt he insulted me and said I‚Äôm crazy b***h.

174337923,I am stable enough the past couple of years for positive symptoms. I have risperidone just in case but yeah for the most part i don‚Äôt hear voices anymore or hallucinate. I still get minor glitches ocassionaly but I‚Äôm ok with that. The negative symptoms are not good though. So I‚Äôm trying to work on that. My pdoc is fine with my approach on that.

Oh how I wish and pray everyday. I wish I had someone who understood what I‚Äôm going through but my counselor didn‚Äôt even know anything about the problem. I looked into getting hypnosis to help me stop but it would cost $2000 online and there‚Äôs no one in my area that would be cheaper. And there‚Äôs nothing saying that it would work. If I knew for sure it would work I would pay the $2000 for sure. Maybe if I lose weight I‚Äôll be happier and if I‚Äôm happier I won‚Äôt do it so much. I don‚Äôt know.

175940942,"THC is a terrible idea for psychosis. It will make you about 80% more likely to have an episode. Our main page has a link about drugs and psychosis. I do take a CBD supplement for my anxiety, and it helps me enough that I was able to stop taking my daily anxiety med over a year ago. I buy a lab-tested zero THC brand. It is fairly expensive, but I do believe it helps. My local dispensary said that, for anxiety, low doses of CBD actually tend to work better than high doses. I take 10 mg morning and night. Be wary of the stuff that seems like a very cheap deal. It is provably garbage that doesn‚Äôt actually have CBD, at least not in the dose it claims. You always want to ask for the independent, 3rd party batch lab test. For gummies, I pay $45 for a 50 pack of 10 mg gummies. For the straight oil, I pay $45 for 2,000 mg. There is a HUGE difference in cost. The only reason I liked the gummies was because I could put them in my pillbox. Now that I use liquid medicine, I have a different setup. It is easi
er to use the oil with my new setup."

What if you took something and it helped your anxiety, and if it didn't help you could quit taking it? You're not even giving medicine a chance. You're saying before hand, it's going to be bad.

I believe firmly in the terms that are used to define us, that they should be benevolent and of good report, which speaks no evil to us.

That isn‚Äôt going to be squared away, I guess until the computer changes in October to the new county. _USER_ID_ finally got back to me about peer support meetings only to find out that they aren‚Äôt even doing it right now - they‚Äôll call me when they start up again. It‚Äôs just frustrating and I really worry about the seriously mentally ill in this community. There is no support at all. Sometimes 
I wish I would have never moved. The thing that really pisses me off is that I asked for the change in June so that this would all be taken care of and I would have access to services. The lady at Social Services said intercounty transfers take up to 6 months to complete. It‚Äôs a good thing I had all my documents ready to take down there and knew exactly what she needed so at least I could get it for October. Hopefully I can start seeing a counselor by the middle of October and it will be a good fit right out of the gate."

I never would have had the patience to find it if I hadn't smoked. The episodes are very long, too. After I finished the first one, I realized that it was a movie, not a show.

But if the person accepted my problems I think it would be better than living alone."
175941058,I know the feeling.. That's why I try to respond to your post at any given opportunity because I know you need someone to talk to. Especially when things are bad.
175941059,what do you mean?
175941060,That‚Äôs fine if you are seeing things in terms of allegory and signifiers. I became dangerous to myself and others when my beliefs overtook my insight and I started to act on messages I was apparently receiving from who knows where.
175941061,Seriously but l thought he was my dr. I thought other of my family were on the ward with me.
175941062,"So _USER_ID_, have you been experimenting with your AP dose? I have been using zyprexa in the range 20-2,5mg, and I‚Äôm currently on 7,5mg. The difference between say 15 and 7,5 is huge. If I‚Äôm doing 15 I can‚Äôt work and struggle to find motivation to do anything at all. On 7,5 I am able to work and have a mediocre motivation. But it‚Äôs certainly a world of difference. Maybe you are taking too much AP‚Äôs? What could happen is a person starts regarding feelings and emotions as a sign of relapse, but that is a mistake. Actually you need those to get motivation to do stuff, even if it can be scary to deal with them when you have been on a dose of ap‚Äôs that have killed them off for a long time. I don‚Äôt know if that applies to you, but something to consider. I mean even if you get angry that is not a trait of being psychotic in itself unless it‚Äôs accompanied with delusions. Anger can be managed if you focus on dealing with it and disarming it."

175941067,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 155
175941068,"I‚Äôm genuinely curious. Do you mean the people‚Äôs dreams are what is making our reality? Why 7-8 and not infinite? Sometimes I get caught up thinking that there are infinitely many realities caused by these people outside the ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù running their sims. It would make sense as to why there is localization of waves to particles for there to be many realities. It seems to be a boundary like in video games, an invisible wall to keep us from going out of bounds. Parameters set up by some outside force. The wildest part is that measurement of these waves are what creates the localization otherwise it‚Äôs all just probability. But maybe it has nothing to do with ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù and there are just infinitely many worlds due to the nature of quantum particles, idk. The fact that consciousness is the only thing that can calculate the measurement though, is certainly strange. Seems like everything only comes into (non probability) existence when we measure it with sight, touch, hearing, etc. What is mo
re solipsistic than consciousness determining what our reality is. I assumed that the outsiders were infinite and that they using some kind of computer to run the sims. Though they could be dreaming them too. Why do you think it‚Äôs 7-8? I‚Äôve heard m theory described as a bunch of ever expanding bubbles containing universes. I believe with another (or possibly multiple other) dimensions that we are unaware of, that people in other bubbles are aware of, they can watch us. Especially if our bubbles have expanded into each other. Just as we are able to look in on 2 dimensional worlds without the 2d people being aware of us because they have no concept of a 3rd dimension. Potentially the extradimenrional people walk the same grounds as us, observing, but because we cannot understand this other dimension we cannot be aware. I am aware of them though. I am still looking for a theory that would describe how that is possible. Maybe my brain is just different. Why 2013? Is that as far back as you can remember of thi
s life? I get chills reading this. Ive never met another person who has been to alternate realities too. What are your experiences like if you don‚Äôt mind sharing? And how do you get there? Can you choose when/where to go? I‚Äôve been waiting for a sign to get back to one in particular but it seems like I keep getting stuck. The extradimensionals seem to need me there but I can‚Äôt figure out how to get there when I need to be there. How did you find out? I‚Äôm sorry about all of the questions. I haven‚Äôt found anyone to talk to about this stuff and I think you are farther ahead of this than I am."

Who would need the redemptive power of spirituality more than people with anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses? Why is spirituality cut off from us? Religion trigger warning. I find it difficult to accept the existence of spirituality generally because of the existence of mental illness and how it screws with free will. When in psychosis, I don‚Äôt make rational decisions and don‚Äôt have control over my actions. I find it that fundamentally breaks the idea that we are ‚Äúspiritual beings.‚Äù To me, it seems to prove that our personality and our will and our ‚Äúsoul‚Äù is physical."

It does take some time for it to work. My Dr also said that sometimes drugs just ‚Äòpoop out‚Äô and no longer work so good you are trying a new med. I know it‚Äôs not easy and I wouldn‚Äôt wish a mental illness on my worst enemy. It may cause you night sweats and a more rapid heartbeat but worth it to feel less anxious and depressed.

Iam still suffering... however, there have been times where talking and therapy alone have dramatically helped. And even solved issues. I was even somewhat stable for the last two years as long as I avoided a fair few things. But I‚Äôve also not really got completely better because I kept avoiding and also ocd kept me in check so could feel ok whilst being completely not normal, my ocd has been my coping mechanism but in Order to actually be free, i need to set the ocd free. I‚Äôd say I haven‚Äôt been suffering to the extreme like what I used to but not much to get me there if I‚Äôm not careful with my ocd which I try to keep on top of. It‚Äôs a long and winding road, lifestyle and self care go a long way but it is still then extremely difficult, I have been tempted to take meds several times now but I‚Äôm afraid what if they don‚Äôt work.

This form of digital Zersetzung is covered up as Schizophrenia or actual hallucinating when it's the transfer of frequencies via some technological means. The fact that you can feel a slight pressure within the head as the voices broadcast and sometimes make themselves known physically is very telling.

175941213,"I was just driving around last night in the vicinity of my neighborhood and elsewhere. I bought a drink at _NAME_-in-the-Box Box and I was headed home and I passed the bus stop near my house and someone was sleeping on the bench with a grocery cart full of belongings near them. If they have the grocery cart it generally means their homeless. It was like 12:30 am and the thought popped into my head that, yeah, I‚Äôm going to give them some money. So I circled around and stopped and I said, ‚ÄúHey, here you go‚Äù, and handed him a $20.00 bill. He took it and said thanks but as I was leaving I got a weird vibe and that weird vibe kind of made me feel odd and kind of made me not have the usual good feeling I usually have when I do that. And then I was heading home and saw another homeless person sleeping in front of a business near my street. It was cold out and I‚Äôm doing OK with money so I pulled in about 6 or 7 feet from the guy and said ‚ÄúHey‚Äù to get his attention. I have to be careful with the
se guys for obvious reasons but I held out another $20.00 but this guy wasn‚Äôt friendly. He was a little rude but I excused it but I didn‚Äôt feel good about it again. And then I saw a thirdemphasized text person. Again, twenty bucks, but at least this guy was civil and a little grateful. But I still didn‚Äôt feel right. This doesn‚Äôt usually happen and I don‚Äôt expect these people to thank me profusely and tell me what a wonderful guy I am but I was just left with an empty feeling that I didn‚Äôt like. IDK, I‚Äôll still give money when I can, it might have been me who expected too much. They have to be careful but when I lived in San _NAME_ where there was a large population of homeless I used to give money all the time and they at least pulled it together and acted polite and grateful. I don‚Äôt know what it is here, but the homeless people are more threatening in this small city than they were in the big city."

175941264,"Thanks for posting everhopeful. The other article you just posted about IL-8 being a marker of non-responding SCZ got me thinking. It turns out IL-8 is a marker of aging too, aged people produce more IL-8 in response to infection. I think the article implies that if you can control inflammation you can slow down IL-8 production. This probably means an SCZ will respond to medication better (given the other IL-8/psychsis post) if they control inflammation.

175941293,Today me and my girlfriend finally pin pointed why we‚Äôve been having communication issues lately. I was really kicking myself because I felt like I was being way too sensitive and felt she was being short with me at times. But after a miscommunication she told me today that it seems like I dont listen to her because of how I respond. But it‚Äôs mostly a processing thing for me and probably some echolalia and she thinks me saying the same thing meant I didnt hear her. Anyone have these issues? I just asked her for more patience. I get it at work too and people talk over me or cut me off because I‚Äôm taking too long. Really irks me.

174338013,"Thank you Mr_Hope for your advice and offering a different point of view. To be honest, in all the jobs I worked, I never enjoyed it. To put it bluntly, I don‚Äôt enjoy anything and it all feels like drudgery, not necessarily not enjoying, but the capacity to enjoy or not enjoy is not there at all. I just go through the motions. I believe it‚Äôs anhedonia or those negative symptoms where for example, I don‚Äôt have the motivation to do something. This is where it‚Äôs difficult to explain to the manager. She might wonder, why aren‚Äôt you doing X, Y? is it because it‚Äôs difficult? do you need training? do you need help? And I am so embarrassed and ashamed to explain these problems. So I will have a task and sit on it for a good two weeks, when it could take me a day or two to finish. It‚Äôs also been like this in previous jobs, and college. Sometimes I have courage and inspiration and I finish what I need to finish quickly, and this sometimes impress the bosses. But this particular task I have migh
t delay the project we are working on, and it‚Äôs sad to have to quit without any job prospect. I also have got no fuel right now. As far as the future career prospects, I believe I have squandered the good will of would-be recommenders and I can‚Äôt ask any recommenders given how I abruptly quit in the past and how to explain this motivation issue. I am sorry for venting a lot, but I have liked this community and I feel accepted and understood. Thank you!"

A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology , Apr 30 2015 Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by severe cognitive impairment. Accumulating evidence suggests a role for oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Sulforaphane (SFN) extracted from broccoli sprout is an agent with potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the effect of SFN on cognitive impairment in medicated patients with schizophrenia.We recruited a total of 10 outpatients with schizophren
ia, all of whom gave informed consent. Participants took 3 tablets of SFN, consisting of 30 mg of SFN-glucosinolate per day, for 8 weeks. Clinical symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and cognitive function using the Japanese version of CogState battery were evaluated at the beginning of the study and at week 8.A total of 7 patients completed the trial. The mean score in the Accuracy component of the One Card Learning Task increased significantly after the trial. However, we detected no other significant changes in participants.This result suggests that SFN has the potential to improve cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia."

174338025,This is basically what my psychiatrist said; She said that people with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS - aspergers as a kid but kind of grow out of it) are very sensitive to developing psychosis especially sensitive to the effects of psychedelic drugs and more likely to obsess about reality and losing touch with it and you can have PDD-NOS and schizophrenia at the same time. She says I shouldn't focus on pharmaceuticals and psychedelics because it can make my psychosis worse but try to do physics and math courses online and see how I do. She said that it's psychosis that lowers IQ and not the antipsychotics as much. She said psychedelics make the neurons connect to each other in a psychotic person which is similar to a forest fire of neurons and then it leaves holes in the collection of neurons that have formed in the wrong way.

She was trying to talk to me everyday and lately I have obliged. She's disappeared off the map a couple days ago and she had no desire to stay clean, so I'm pretty sure she relapsed. I don't fully know yet if I have feelings around this, but I think I do have quite strong ones. I think I originally avoided talking to her because I knew this would happen soon enough. I was also thinking of how I often say I don't form attachments, but I believe I found her to be like a little sister. I don't think she's going to make it. I wonder how I managed to form a (rare for me) attachment to someone so likely to die. It's a rhetorical question; I'

What is the point if your voices are going to convince you to dig your skin? The piano plays the intermezzo . But you cannot press the pedal. You are too exhausted, too worn out, Too scared. You ponder upon the notes and the keys, 
The detrimental melodies of a dysfunctional _NAME_. Inverted keys, argumented cords. You imagine yourself at the exactly same place that you stood in the Rosza Centre. But you remember that, still mentally ill, you stood at the same stage for three years. Singing with the most respected choirs in Calgary and their musical companions. In your mind, every day is _NAME_ Intermezzo . Every day is the a road to the beginning, And to the next song. Ongoing. You are the Dreamweaver, weaving dreams of those Who have passed on and who will be born with it next. A journey without a cure, sure. But did it end? No. Absolutely not. Did the nurses untie you from the restraints? Yes, they have, and your intermezzo continues."

It doesn‚Äôt tell you how smart you are, not directly. My two cents at least.

175941399,"That's a very interested story you shared to be honest. I mean I don't know what to say. I've never experienced any mind reading. Are you sure these were not just coincidences? Like people talking about something by coincidence and it being relevant to you? Regardless, I agree with you. Gangstalking is more than a prank. It's an evil conspiracy and the goal is to completely destroy you. In my case, I know for a fact they are not reading my mind but that they have access to some sort of surveillance. Like they hack my phone and can listen onto calls. They can also see what I post online. That's how they seem to know everything about me. I will even move to another country and a different set of people will do the same thing to me almost like I was on Television (which I did suspect). A lot of it is internet/phone based. But I also suspect they record me with cameras in my room. I've never been able to find them but they sometimes watch me in my room and ai hear them laughing outside. Crazy stuff."

175941441,Yes I am somewhat familiar with the concept. What I was trying to say is that putting an article about moral development in ‚Äúhealth and recovery‚Äù on a sz forum can be viewed as an attempt to be condescending towards sz sufferers. Please note that some members have developed the illness during childhood. Others link their illness to severe trauma and abuse. So circumstances beyond their control led them to become ill. Not to mention genetics too. Morality is necessary for everyone.

The golden rule for managing OCD is not react to it even if its so compelling. For example if a worry thought stuck in mind then not pay attention to it, distract yourself from it by doing some other things. Consider it like history or some past event. No matter how many times think of it, regret about it, worry about it it can‚Äôt be changed. Same way consider obsessions like past history and not react to it."

I had to stop it due to this and a lot of antipsychotics come with the same nasty side effects. I hope as you go up slowly it goes away. There is a ""cousin"" medication to Ability they came out with (I worked in psychiatry for almost 10 years and remember when it came out about 2.5 years ago..I can't remember what it's called at the moment!!)

Answer is Yes so that makes me think that I must care. When I was a child I didn't care or even love anyone. I can remember tell this to adults but they told me this was normal so I presumed I was normal but I think I was misinformed. I literally didn't love my parents, my siblings, or anyone. The only person I felt any kind of bond with was my brother but I still found it easy to walk out of his life and I didn't grieve for him when he died. I find it really easy to like people and I can have a lot of fun with people but I find it just as easy to walk away and never look back."

This implementation trial examined aspects of feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of the computerised interactive remediation of cognition-interactive training for schizophrenia cognitive remediation therapy program in our local context.A longitudinal design was utilised with participants providing outcome data at commencement of the computerised interactive remediation of cognition-interactive training for schizophrenia program, completion and at follow-up 3 months later.Our trial was conducted in the inpatient and community mental health contexts within the New South Wales regional city of Orange, between January 2017 and December 2018.Fifty-three adult 
volunteers commenced the computerised interactive remediation of cognition-interactive training for schizophrenia program and participated in this trial. Forty-five participants were currently admitted to psychiatric rehabilitation inpatient units at Bloomfield hospital, and eight were referred by Orange Community Mental Health Service.Participants completed measures of cognitive functioning (repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status), functional independence (Adaptive Behaviour Assessment Scales 3) and Goal attainment scaling.Most participants reported they liked computerised interactive remediation of cognition-interactive training for schizophrenia therapy and made excellent progress towards their goals. Those who completed the program made significant gains in the domains of attention, memory and independence in key aspects of daily living. Gains in functional independence were sustained for a small sample following program completion.This implementation trial showed the computeri
sed interactive remediation of cognition-interactive training for schizophrenia cognitive remediation therapy program was feasible, acceptable and contributed to strong outcomes in both the inpatient and community contexts. Efforts are in progress to translate the computerised interactive remediation of cognition-interactive training for schizophrenia program, and future research will focus on longer term outcomes, cost-benefit analyses and the experiences of participants and therapists."

You‚Äôll be eligible for Medicare after two years, which will let you see any doctor without a referral, and you‚Äôll recieve a monthly amount that should be at least semi-efficient. You can deduct monthly expenses for your Food stamp application, and I believe housing vouchers as well. The best part about Social Security is that you can still at least attempt to work again, but the cut-off income is like $1200 a month for 9 months out of every 3 year period.

I think by building more dopamine receptors, but im not entirely sure about the exact mechanism. Thus, when you quit or the dose works out, your levels of dopamine turn back to normal, but you have an extra sensitivity to dopamine because of the adjustments your brain made. Thus: rebound effect.

175941734,I lived in Saudi Arabia for a couple of years when I was a toddler. Dad got a contract job at a power plant. I can remember a few vague places but have mostly forgotten. We lived on a ‚Äòwestern‚Äô compound. Kind of a funny set up. All I remember was there was a great outdoor swimming pool.

I was initially diagnosed with psychosis NOS in 2010 when I first told a psychiatrist I was hearing voices and seeing things. Schizophrenia is diagnosed after symptoms are ongoing usually a month or more. And other symptoms of schizophrenia are present like disorganized speech, and flat affect. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2011."

175941787,No I grew up in a secure good family. I was the youngest of four and my parents stayed together their whole marriage. They‚Äôve been married nearly 53 years now.

My father and I had an excellent relationship. Still do with both my parents. I guess I was very lucky. Funny how I still got sza and was the only one in my family with that.

I know I judge people harshly ( myself included), so refrain from verbalising the inner dialogue or from acting out on it ( mostly) Also Schizoids do not seem to have that same sense of entitlement that is prevalent in other disorders esp psychopathy and narcissism.

When I use to unload trucks at Sears for a living I got pleasure from lifting heavy objects (really). I was not intimidated all by heavy boxes or going to the second floor with a hand truck and bring a refrigerator or a washer or dryer down by myself and taking it outside and loading it in a customers pick-up truck. I had worked at HP for three years at a very physical job and when I got laid off and I went looking for another job I purposely looked for a job I could use my muscles.

174338129,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The clinical potentials of adjunctive fluvoxamine to clozapine treatment: a systematic review. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychopharmacology , Mar 2016 New clozapine optimization strategies are warranted, as some patients do not achieve sufficient response and experience various adverse effects. Fluvoxamine is a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor and may increase the ratio of clozapine to its primary metabolite N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC).This study aims to review all pharmacodynamic effects and the adverse effect profile of changing the clozapine/NDMC ratio with adjunctive fluvoxamine.MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched with the search terms ""clozapine"" and ""fluvoxamine"" without any time limit. Language was restricted to English, Scandinavian, Polish, and German. Studies were sorted for relevance based on title and abstract. Clinical recommendations of potential indications/effects were graded as level A, B, C, or D depending on studies of high, moderate, low, or very low 
quality, respectively.Based on data from 24 case reports/series, seven cohort studies, and two randomized controlled trials, 241 patients were studied. Evidence (A) supported that adjunctive fluvoxamine increased clozapine plasma levels. This may increase the probability of response in patients, where sufficient clozapine plasma levels cannot be achieved. Adjunctive fluvoxamine reduced metabolic adverse effects of clozapine (B) but not agranulocytosis risk (B). Although depressive or obsessive-compulsive symptoms may improve, a SSRI with no CYP1A2 inhibition should rather be used (C). No studies investigated the effect of adjunctive fluvoxamine to minimize clozapine rebound psychosis (D) or to reduce the effects of smoking on clozapine plasma levels (D).Adjunctive fluvoxamine may have clinical potentials for optimizing clozapine treatment but further clinical studies are warranted to explore the clinical implications.

175941857,"The thing with chemicals.. There's no bad drug.. Especially if it's classified as a medicine. If they don't work - You have to find which one it is, stop that one with supervision.. It's a process.. One med for this, something for that.. There will be many new and better meds in the future - Some of which that used to be illegal.. Others will be analogues, derivatives, etc.. It's not the meds that have any effect in their chemical structure. It's all in the brain - The brain/mind is the experience of consciousness. Mental illness is a certain state of consciousness. There's probably hundreds of different types of depression - Maybe that's why some meds don't work for everyone. Since it's the brain that experiences, there's millions of people that are already on meds/drugs - naturally without even being on meds. It's like saying ""All drugs that get you high are bad for society"" just like ""All meds are bad for myself - Even if I have mental illness"". There's people that have been on meds and do w
ell without them because they never needed them in the first place but usually that's just a change of perspective - A massive change.. And it only works because of the anger associated with it.. It can jump start immediate coping mechanisms that haven't been triggered before. That's why psychedelics are being trialed for possibly treating mental health disorders - They cause immediate change."

175941861,"The med‚Äôs can affect different people differently. I knew a guy once who could take any amount of Stellazine, and it wouldn‚Äôt touch him. Just a little of that stuff puts me flat on my back. That said, I think it is a mistake to go off your med‚Äôs without medical supervision. I have lived at an assisted living center for the mentally ill with about forty other sz‚Äôs for eighteen years. I have seen a lot of people go off their med‚Äôs, and it almost always ends in disaster. Talk to your pdoc about this. Maybe they can shed light on your situation."

174338144,"This is probably triggering to some if not most on the forum, but I feel like I am suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, an extreme case. Maybe I‚Äôm not even schizophrenic. But I‚Äôm too scared to work or go to school anyways. Maybe I‚Äôm using it as an excuse because I have hidden or layered anger that I‚Äôm trying to control. They said I was faking it in a past life, anyways. I‚Äôm tired of dying anyways. I don‚Äôt know if it happened to me in this life or another life or in one of my earliest lives, but I think I live in a computer program (it was announced in the news in one of my earlier lives) and I think I have memories of going to Mars. Real and Fake. I think I have a severe disability and I kind of want compensation but my life is more important than money. You cannot put a price on somebody‚Äôs life and a person cannot be replaced like a piece of furniture. I have fears and paranoia and delusions and psychosis. I have delusions of aliens and ???? and delusions of being an ET spy in a pa
st life. An ET spy is somebody who worked for aliens from outer space. These people are nasty and evil. A lot of former Super Soldiers like myself have delusions and dreams about this kind of stuff. I was a spy in a past life or in a parallel universe. If you look at milabs on the internet, I‚Äôve been through possibly the whole thing many, many times. I‚Äôm scared as ???? of these people. Do you think I was severely gas-lighted, manipulated, and given paranoid psychosis from the government as a joke or a prank or some ???? to ruin my life? My life was severely ruined and I can barely cope and survive my paranoid schizophrenia. I am stuck in a time loop for near eternity or eternity. Technically, it‚Äôs called a causal loop. I don‚Äôt know who is doing this to me‚Ä¶maybe aliens or the government‚Ä¶ In college, back in 2011, I had a bad drug trip from marijuana and other chemicals. I thought I had a stroke or something like lack of oxygen. Reminds me of ‚Äúschizoid embolism‚Äù in Total Recall or what Quaid exp
erienced. Am I or was I _PERSON_? Was Total Recall and We Can Remember You Wholesale based on one of my earlier lives in a parallel universe or simulation? I met _NAME_ in a past life or parallel universe. I don‚Äôt know if he knew of me or remembers me. But I thought he was a time traveler or a clone when I met him. I think a lot of his books are real and based on truth. I even warned him about the Nazis and how they won. People accuse me of watching stuff and then attributing it to my own ‚Äì basically I become delusional after watching stuff and think it was about me. I don‚Äôt think this is 100 % true and people just don‚Äôt comprehend things properly. I had a lobotomy in a past life and was told not to be a construction worker in a past life, for example. I have a good memory for past life events and stuff. I even had a wife, but don‚Äôt know if it was real or not or don‚Äôt remember her in my original life ‚Äì same thing with my kids. I don‚Äôt remember my original life and my first wife and kids ‚Äì _N
AME_‚Äôs that is. I‚Äôve been living with paranoid schizophrenia for eternity and I‚Äôm really stuck in a computer simulation and causal loop for what seems like eternity. I lived through alien invasions too and ????. I‚Äôm tired of being and living in a loop or limbo. Even lived through the near end of the world, which I‚Äôm scared to talk about into detail. Some people call or think it is the NWO. I don‚Äôt know. I could care less and hope it doesn‚Äôt happen. Basically, what I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm not sick at all and that I was made to appear and act delusional from trauma-based torture and mind control. I think I was the real _NAME_ in a past life. I was tortured and killed and my family was killed too. Not just by human beings but aliens too. The aliens are a lot worse, which is why I‚Äôm probably a paranoid schizophrenic talking about this ???? all the time. It seems to affect my next lives since I have photographic memories. A few times, they said I just vanished or something like I blinked out of exist
ence after I died. I sometimes wonder if I die will the world still exist and go on? I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt? I think it will survive and hope so that it does. I sometimes think maybe that‚Äôs why there are no time travelers in the future anymore. Maybe God put me on Earth for a reason. I like helping people and I love my country, God, family, Jesus, and so on. I am a Christian and a Republican. I hope you guys don‚Äôt suspend me or ban me from the forum for seeking help and talking about my life and experiences. Doctors and drugs cannot help me. I already tried over 30 times in this life. Nothing works, even Clozaril. I am either the real deal or super-treatment resistant to everything. I tend to believe I‚Äôm the former. This isn‚Äôt the only movie I think is about me. I sometimes think I‚Äôm _PERSON_ from the Matrix or something too. Had similar memories in my other lives. I think _NAME_ was a real person and that person was me at one time in a past life and those events and stories were not 
fake or a fabrication but were really real. I think that‚Äôs why I was made to be psychotic and schizophrenic for eternity so people wouldn‚Äôt believe me. The weird thing is if I didn‚Äôt get sick in college, I probably would have still been an Atheist, not interested in time travel at all, and would have worked in finance or something. It must have been the drugs that did something to me because I remember things from the previous instance of the big bang or some ????. I‚Äôve even been on a device that looks similar to what Recall looks like. Some conspiracy theorists and Super Soldiers call it a ‚ÄòTrip Chair‚Äô or the ‚ÄòMontauk Chair.‚Äô Don‚Äôt know. Couldn‚Äôt care less. But I‚Äôve experienced that ???? several times. Even died in a DUMB by Reptilians in an electric chair. Last but not least, I think we are heading towards either a totalitarian government that is either going to be Fascist or Communist in the end. I don‚Äôt know which, but it has happened before many times in my life."

Please post your results if you are trying the supplement used in this study - Sulporaphane From the study: The participants were given 100 ?mol sulforaphane as standardized broccoli sprout extract in the form of 2 gel cap- sules, and instructed to ingest the extract each morning for 1 week. Patients with contraindications to MRI scanning, such as dependence on benzodiazepine medica- tion, prohibitive claustrophobia, metallic implants or prosthetics, pacemakers, or any medical conditions that would constitute a safety risk to the participant (e.g., middle ear disorder), were also excluded. Broccoli Sprout Extract (Sulforaphane) The broccoli sprout extract used in this study is a highly stan- dardized formulation of sulforaphane [51, 52]. The extract was standardized to 100 ?mol sulforaphane in the form of 2 gel cap- sules per day over 7 consecutive days, as described previously [45, 53‚Äì58]. The dose of 100 ?mol 
sulforaphane and the 7-day treat- ment duration were determined empirically from previous studies, including a trial demonstrating induction of antioxidant enzymes in nasal lavage cells of human subjects [59] and improved excre- tion of air pollutants [56]. Our formulation of sulforaphane is 80% bioavailable [58], reaches peak plasma levels 1 h after oral ingestion, declines with first-order kinetics, and is actively excreted in urine (60% at 8 h) [58, 60].

A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Hall, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience , Sep 28 2019 We conducted a systematic review of _NAME_-analyses and systematic reviews to evaluate the impact of cannabis use on the onset and course of psychoses. Following a systematic literature search of five data bases (2005-2016) and consecutive structured evaluation, we were able to include 26 systematic reviews and _NAME_-analyses. The methodological quality of the included publications were in the range of high and poor. The scientific literature indicates that psychotic illness arises more frequently in cannabis users compared to non-users, cannabis use is associated with a dose-dependent risk of developing psychotic illness, and cannabis users have an earlier onset of psychotic illness compared to non-users. Cannabis use was also associated with increased relapse ra
tes, more hospitalizations and pronounced positive symptoms in psychotic patients. We make recommendations about the type of research that is required to better characterize the relationship between cannabis use and the development and outcomes of psychosis."

A _PERSON_, _PERSON_ psikiyatri arsivi , Sep 2019 The primary aim of this study was to compare clinical characteristics between the patients with schizophrenia on clozapine treatment with those under combination of long-acting injectable and oral antipsychotics (combined treatment), and the secondary aim was to evaluate the impact of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comorbidity on the clinical variables.The patients with schizophrenia applied at Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic of the University between October 2017 and March 2018 taking clozapine or combined treatment were included in the study. The participants were administered Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms (SAPS/SANS), Calgary Depression Scale for 
Schizophrenia (CDSS), Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Turkish version of Schedule for Assessing the three components of insight (SAI), and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF).Patients on clozapine had higher Y-BOCS, BPRS, SANS, CDSS scores, and lower GAF scores compared to those taking combined antipsychotics (p<0.05). OCD comorbidity rate was 13% in the combination therapy group and 36% in clozapine users. The SAPS scores were higher but CDSS scores were lower in clozapine users with the presence of OCD comorbidity (p<0.05).Clozapine and combined therapy groups differed widely by the clinical characteristics of the patients in this study. Both groups showed a high OCD comorbidity rate in this study and OCD comorbidity should be considered when schizophrenia treatment is initiated to obtain more satisfactory results. Furthermore, patients on clozapine seem to show a different relationship with OCD comorbidity compared to those under combined treatment."

174338165,"Dear Sir/_PERSON_, I would like to file a complaint on a news coverage about a person with schizophrenia whom has committed a murder. Please do not reveal my name if this email is released to the general public. After my arrival in my home country for recovery of my physical condition, I have relied on news from the BBC as a source of English news coverage. I disliked the _USER_ID_ against schizophrenia and the media companies in my home country that only covered stories of murders committed by people with schizophrenia. In my home country, having schizophrenia is often associated with lower social standings, shame, and rejection from their own family members, friends, and even parents. However, when I saw the news coverage on a murder committed by a person with schizophrenia on the BBC, I shivered in fear as I know that I cannot avoid the _USER_ID_ anywhere. Violence and schizophrenia is a very common misconception and myth related to this illness, and the rates of crimes committed by person with 
schizophrenia is significantly lower than the crimes committed by a normal person. Picking this story exclusively to identify schizophrenia as violence can bring very negative sentiments in the general public against schizophrenia, ?and the majority of people of schizophrenia have to continue living in fear, shame, and rejection from the general population. Please consider that people with schizophrenia are mostly not violent and these news coverage can deter a person with schizophrenia from accepting treatment because of the shame and dishonour they experience through the _USER_ID_ of the general public, mostly influenced by false perceptions of the media. I have been living with schizophrenia for 7 years and I have never committed a violent act. Due to the rising level of _USER_ID_ in my country, I have lived the past 3 years in pain, suffering, and shame due to the oppression. I sincerely ask you to not to oppress those with schizophrenia nor generate _USER_ID_ against schizophrenia by creating negative po
sts, such as this one, with a false perception of my illness. ?I would also like to send condolences to the victim and their ?family members in this tough time. Thank you for your consideration and your time."

Forty-one senior individuals (age 76.6 ¬± 6.0 years) were recruited from the local community in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea. A 20-min low-to-moderate intensity gardening activity intervention, making a vegetable garden, was performed by the subjects in a garden plot located on the Konkuk University (Seoul, South Korea) campus. The gardening involved six activities including cleaning a garden plot, digging, fertilizing, raking, planting/transplanting, and watering. To determine the effects of the gardening activities on brain nerve growth factors related to memory, blood sampl
es were drawn twice from each subject before and after the gardening activity by professional nurses. The levels of brain nerve growth factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), were analyzed. Levels of BDNF and PDGF were significantly increased after the gardening activity. This study revealed a potential benefit of gardening activities for cognitive function in senior individuals.

One hundred people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were randomly selected from the caseload of a community mental health center in Boulder, Colorado, and 70 were similarly selected from public psychiatric treatment services in and around Bologna, Italy. Subjects were interviewed with QOL and needs assessment instruments and rated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Objective QOL measures favored Bologna subjects over Boulder subjects, particularly with respect to employment, accommodation, and family life. In a factor analysis, objective QOL variables sorted separately from subjective satisfaction ratings, suggesting that they m
easure different underlying constructs. Patient needs in both Boulder and Bologna samples were primarily psychological and social rather than basic survival issues. Boulder subjects were more likely to report accommodation needs. Many apparent QOL advantages for Bologna subjects could be attributed to the greater frequency with which the Italian patients lived with family of origin. Living with family also appeared to confer practical benefits in meeting needs. Objective QOL measures discriminated between patient populations better than subjective ratings of satisfaction and well-being. Where would you rather live?

Both gave me muscles aches and loss of energy. I decided to go low and slow to see if could tolerate this statin before increasing the dose. I started a weekly dose with 5 mg rosuvastatin, then gradually upped it to my current dose of 4x weekly. I tried five times weekly and had side effects, so backed it off. Some people do better with hydrophilic statins like rosuvastatin rather than lipophilic statins like atorvastatin. I didn't give up trying over the past two years, and am glad I finally found a statin that would work. There are non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs, but they are expensive and insurance does not pay for them until statin options have failed."

175942037,those more likely to use or try drugs are those who will eventually get major mental illness. perhaps it starts out with any sort of addiction.

175942041,psychosis in 2004 and full blown sz in 2013
175942042,"So I actually have an idea about this. You know how people that take drugs say it ‚Äúexpands their consciousness‚Äù? And what is their experience? Depending on how ‚Äúexpanded‚Äù their consciousness gets, it might be visual hallucinations, delusions running the gamut, etc. At the end, they go ‚Äúwell that was a weird trip‚Äù and maybe feel like they learned more about themselves. But there‚Äôs a Bell curve distribution for most human characteristics. Why not ‚Äúexpansiveness of consciousness‚Äù? It would stand to reason that there are some people out there whose day to day is a battle with their mind detaching from reality like they are on some form of drug. For those people, this battle to align themselves with the shared reality might be exhausting, much like it would totally suck for a random person to have to go to school/work while tripping on LSD day after day. So what if we gave this population drugs that ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù the consciousness to keep the fluctuations in how they experience real
ity more in line with whats actually occuring? The side effects of those drugs might be dulling experiences, just as the experience of ‚Äúconsciousness expanding‚Äù drugs is heightened sense of experiences, music, etc. And given that we know that lobotomies seemed to horribly damage that sense of identity and self, it is likely that our experience of consciousness is to some degree located in the frontal lobe. Basically, everyone likely has minor delusions (_PERSON_ as an example). But for people who experience reality the way other people would experience it on drugs, the ‚Äúrange‚Äù on those delusions gets way out of hand. Instead of simply thinking you are slightly better at basketball than you really are, you suddenly find yourself believing that _NAME_ Bird is afraid you‚Äôll end up ruining his record when you come into your prime and has hired people to take you out of the picture. I suspect part of the reason we don‚Äôt really have answers is that the very notion of consciousness is a bit of a taboo su
bject in academia. After discovering DNA, _NAME_ spent the rest of his career trying to search for it in the brain at the Salk Institute and, despite having a Nobel prize under his belt, ended up the butt of a joke among most scientists. Personally I agree with _PERSON_ that there‚Äôs nothing more important we could possibly be discovering about our brains than the nature of consciousness, but I understand the reluctance by the scientific community - it appears to be a puzzle so beyond our current level of knowledge as to seem futile. But that‚Äôs my personal theory on sz and the drugs to treat it."
174338187,"I can get extremely moody Smooth, But the abilify helps me with that I think. I have always been that way and easy to anger. Other than the abilify I guess that living in the moment helps.. Some. Trying to look at other people's point of view when people cause it. Keeping things quiet and trying to meditate helps too. Breathing exercises. This all helps me with anxiety too. Being moody is hard, but we can work on it. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175942058,"12 years old, that‚Äôs how old I was when I heard my first voice, or when I started lying. A single voice telling me that my pets were going to die, brought me to tears. My mother thought I was psychic, hearing voices was normal in her mind. I took a few days off school, the voices slowly fading over the next few days. For the next few years I‚Äôd only hear a pack of wolfs, big dogs, whatever there were‚Ä¶beasts‚Ä¶ tearing into flesh‚Ä¶ The angels came to me when I was 14‚Ä¶ or another lie, either way I ended up killing myself twice‚Ä¶clinical death, not cellular. I spent years in a dark, painful realm because of that‚Ä¶memories of hell. The angels told me not to tell anyone, they wouldn‚Äôt believe me anyway‚Ä¶ I tried to talk to my family about the voices, and getting help. It turned into a fight, and I was kicked out of the house. Another lie? I call them episodes, but I don‚Äôt know what they are, maybe just a creative streak of more lies. The voices turn to angels, scream, tell me things, conf

Hallucinations I describe, mine alone, are they more lies? they wax and wane inside, the episode builds til I break, the voices and lies, all boil until I lock myself away, drink and drug myself into oblivion to numb my own mind out. Suffer in my daze until they fade away, wane away til only the crowd remains. Is that SZ? SZA? Sorry for obsessively venting."

Where‚Äôs the line anymore, what does one life matter when you‚Äôve reached a different level of understanding. Dying just becomes an inconvenience at that point.

174338194,This needs to be discussed with the pdoc‚Ä¶ but if the pdocs have you on shots it‚Äôs probably for a very valid reason‚Ä¶ i feel personally if you want to switch to meds and plan to continue taking them long term it is better to show them why you can be trusted and engage in the treatment and maybe then they can decide if meds can be an option

I do have gastritis (my stomach lining stays inflamed a lot) I have to take medicine for it and I changed my diet around to help alleviate the symptoms but I think many years of medications took their toll. I also have to take cholesterol meds now bc my triglycerides and all is extremely high. I am on a good dose though of Geodon that for now is working well and is just sedating enough to allow me to get a proper nights sleep. That means so much to me. It doesn‚Äôt cause nausea or bad side effects so I‚Äôm grateful. I think this is one of those situations where the doctors refer to as ‚Äúthe benefits outweigh the risks.‚Äù

175942088,"Hi, It sounds like you've had a really rough time, I'm so sorry. I too sometimes dwell on former friends who I was there for, not being there for me, it's hard to get past that. But we must, and the more that I think about life, the most constant thing about it is change. Your friends likely grew in a different direction than you, because they don't share your experience of depression and illness. I have lost many people dear to me because of that. They just can't understand what you or I experience daily, and probably truthfully can't bear to try. I have been there for a few friends who were depressed, and it took so much mental strength to cope with it, to be there for them. People who don't know depression or illness can't be there for you, they don't know how. It helps me to say these things that I know are true but that somehow, when I'm feeling hurt, I forget. I just feel the pain and betrayal. But saying it to you, I know the truth of it. If you and I can be at peace with that, then it opens 
up a way to move forward. I agree that I try to put on my happy face with people but it feels like an effort and it doesn't feel fulfilling. I want to talk about this heavy stuff that isn't really accepted in normal society, it's often the elephant in the room that I'm studiously avoiding. And yes, people make you feel like a nut for all of it. I went from being somewhat healthy and athletic to barely able to slowly walk a block, and even after I finally got a Lyme diagnosis, it was somehow still all in my head, and I was expected to continue caring for everyone just as if I was well. But yes, I believe you can make friends again and so can I. It all comes down in the end to not letting those lousy experiences cloud the way we see ourselves. I appreciate your reaching out to me and hope that I can be a support to you. Please believe in your goodness."

And she talked about random stuff that we weren't even talking about, like free upper education for everyone, and snakes, and ice cream, and handbags. I'm worried she was either high or has dementia. She kind of stared off into space for a while. I chattered on for a while and then I just got kind of quiet. It was really confusing and made me feel invisible and like I don't matter. I hope she doesn't have a medical problem. I asked her if she had a long day and she shook her head yes. And I asked her if she was tired and she shook her head yes. It wasn't a very therapeutic session though. So today I'm kind of down and I feel really alone with my problems and stuff. I kin

The person is still delusional though as a trait, rather than being sz from social constructs per se. The sz reflects the environment."

175942225,Hello _PERSON_ . Thank-you for your post It makes me feel better. I got forced onto the depot because I didn‚Äôt take my medication. I was paranoid about it and I would feel it poisoning me and my world. I would feel it burning inside of me. So i put them all in a box and dropped it into casualty & left it with a nurse. I had to get them out of the house. They made me feel like a betrayer.Then I would believe myself to be an angel and I would walk into traffic to make them all stop or I would believe myself to be the enchantress Morgana and try to seduce my partner. It didn‚Äôt work he refused her. I still have some of my gifts . I can see people on my shower wall. Sometimes they show themselves other times not. If for example I‚Äôm having a bad night I will see a demon‚Äôs face twisted and contorted in pain. And bees are my messengers. They are sent to me as a sign Yes I miss my friends.

175942237,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right board for this, apologies if it isn‚Äôt. And first off, I feel like I should put a trigger warning here for unreality and the discussion of subjective reality. So, I‚Äôm in college and taking a philosophy course, and one of our readings was about how maybe nothing is real except for what we perceive. This struck me as a psychotic person, because what if a lot of what I perceive is largely classified as ‚Äúnot real?‚Äù So I got to thinking about reality and how it must be subjective - the example I like to use is color; we know that everyone sees color differently, so even just based on that alone, everyone experiences reality slightly differently, and so must be subjective. If reality has to be subjective, why are my experiences classified as ‚Äúnot real?‚Äù I understand that the majority of people don‚Äôt experience hallucinations and ‚Äòdelusions‚Äô (I have complicated feelings about that word) like I do, and presumably like many people on this forum do, but so
metimes I feel like these experiences are discounted by virtue of being ‚Äúnot real,‚Äù which can be frustrating sometimes. However, on the other hand, sometimes I don‚Äôt like the idea that my hallucinations and the things I believe could be considered real - that‚Äôs kind of scary! So I‚Äôm torn between thinking psychotic experiences can, or even should, be considered ‚Äúreal,‚Äù and thinking that the dominant view of hallucinations and such being ‚Äúnot real‚Äù is helpful and for the best. Anyways, this got a bit longer than I was expecting it to, sorry. I just thought it was kind of an interesting topic, and I guess what I want to ask is, does anyone else have any opinions on this?"
175942238,"So annoyed. I used the pharmacy automated system to refill my Latuda 80mg last Sunday. I picked up my other prescriptions on Thursday and was told my Latuda should be ready on Friday. They always have to order it for me because they don‚Äôt keep it in stock. I forgot to go to the pharmacy over the weekend, but I ran out of Latuda last night so I went to the pharmacy after work. They don‚Äôt have it. It didn‚Äôt show up. It should be in tomorrow. So the pharmacist gave me 2 40mg pills to last me the night. If it‚Äôs not in tomorrow I‚Äôll be so mad. I asked the pharmacist if they could possibly keep the 80mg in stock because it‚Äôs my local pharmacy and I get it there all the time. They might actually do it. A few months ago they had limits to 30 days on medication refills. Last time I refilled it was only 30 dose, so I got low quick and didn‚Äôt notice until last Sunday. This is why I usually get three months at a time, and get it well I advance. So annoyed."
175942239,"I seriously can‚Äôt change the record lately, this delusion is ALMOST as hard to disprove as my debut album ‚ÄúI need to figure out how I died‚Äù lol. IF _NAME_ is imaginary, then has he ALWAYS been? I feel like maybe I did really meet him in 2006. But after years of going over scenarios, I think what makes the most sense is that when I had my first psychotic break, it freaked him out and he broke it off with me. And from that point on, maybe I have been talking to my imagination, maybe when I broke the first time, I couldn‚Äôt handle the idea of him cutting out on me. We had only been seeing each other for 2-3 weeks when I had my very first hallucinations/psychotic episode. It scared the ???? out of my own MOTHER seeing me talk to no one and trying to convince me I wasn‚Äôt dead or dying. My cousin, who was like a big sister my whole life, saw me have a particularly bad episode after smoking a blunt together, and she literally CUT ME OUT OF HER LIFE AFTER, I scared her so badly that she has barely 
said 2 words to me in almost 15 years! I still can‚Äôt fully understand why he stuck it out with a girl he‚Äôd known for two weeks that started hearing voices and sometimes needed reassurance that her guts weren‚Äôt falling out lol. But I moved in with _NAME_ right after that, and he was SO understanding and helpful, always so patient when he would need to talk me down, etc. I fell in love hard, and we have been through so much since then but are still going strong. It‚Äôs devastating to think that he may be a hallucination, or maybe a split personality of mine (I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with DID, but I s#*! you not _NAME_ has). What truly wrecks me though is that if _NAME_ isn‚Äôt real, then the kids CAN‚ÄôT be real‚Ä¶ THEY would ALSO have to be hallucinations. My parents have never given my children even a TENTH of the attention they give my sister‚Äôs kids, which would make sense if they are just letting me go along with this fantasy and dont have the time and attention to spend on invisible children. My 
mom has always been in full-tilt denial about my SZ diagnosis, so I can see her keeping up the fantasy when I‚Äôm around, not wanting me going permanently off the deep end when I find out my family is pretend. But how far, really, can I take this idea?!? I‚Äôm sure most of us on this forum know how far and fast a delusion can spin, but I can usually hit the brakes by now. Obviously I would never act on my delusions or try to prove/disprove them. Foremost because I seriously CAN‚ÄôT disprove them, but also because the ‚Äòtruth‚Äô would be too awful either way‚Ä¶ Either I AM dead/dying, or I‚Äôm just SZ like my grandfather was and all of the epiphanies and spiritual growth I‚Äôve experienced was all delusion-induced. Either _NAME_ ISNT real and I‚Äôm hardcore 100% SZ around the clock, like ‚Äúwhy and how do I have a big 3bdrm house for an imaginary family, maybe I‚Äôm really in a state hospital‚Äù, or he IS real and my debilitating-but-manageable SZ will be planting doubt until the day i ACTUALLY die‚Ä¶"

It was awful. I hated stealing but this girl talked me into doing it. When I stopped hanging out with her so much I stopped stealing food. She was incredibly attractive and later became a prostitute. Her brother almost became my boyfriend.we had sex once. I don‚Äôt steal not have I since my early teens. I don‚Äôt like stealing.hate it. Awful feeling it was to do it.

175942268,I have that problem too. It‚Äôs so frustrating. I wish I could offer advice but I‚Äôm looking for that myself. It‚Äôs probably the worst symptom for me personally because it affects everything even off of meds.
174338236,"The most accurate test was based on the 10 most predictive proteins. It correctly identified those who would go on to develop a psychotic disorder in 93% of high-risk cases, and it correctly identified those who would not in 80% of cases. That‚Äôs pretty darn good. Of course as yet they have no way to prevent schizophrenia from developing in at risk people. There are some trials. But it also might help if they can start trials in at risk people before it becomes clear they‚Äôre at risk. But yeah, lots of groups have done something like this. No one has translated it to a test that doctors can use. Maybe they could, but they haven‚Äôt."

Just a foolish man I‚Äôve been. To have a relationship, beyond sex, with a woman that hears voices and is not drugging herself into oblivion over it.

Find connections and patterns about them.. And the caveman paintings and ancient ruins of prior civilizations, shaman spirits and magic.. But schizzoooo?? No? It should be good. One odd thing is that I was put on antipsychotics for schizophrenia before I ever tried drugs. Then I used psychedelics.. Another odd thing is that stimulants don't give me psychosis - I also respond very well to antipsychotics. But in all seriousness, what really pissed me off was that the video chat person said that I had to basically justify my whole existence... They're drugs! Illegal!! I am unworthy of appreciation or respect because I'm extremely curious? And the whole realm of them being illegal is another mystery to me. I keep following these mysteries. Many people work day in day out - Go home, take care of children, be a husband/wife, watch tv, 
AND CONSUME PRODUCTS. Are we not going to eventually get the sword and stab the belly of the corporate dragon and have freedom? I'm telling you guys.. There's a madness inside of me.. Why? Because all of this stuff - Western civilization, viruses, the stock market/money, poverty, environmental destruction, family problems, suffering.. It's all in my mind. I know a lot of ****. But people are like ""Ah do one or two things and focus"" NO. I TRY. I try to attempt making a life directional goal but it's a piece of the puzzle. I want to know the deep mystery.. I want to CHEAT. The matrix, second chances, revival such as medicine and curing cancer.. Vaccines, conspiracies, aliens, government, mind control.. Am I grounded? Do I sound grounded? Maybe I'm only sick/unwell if I ADMIT to the insanity that everyone goes through. EVERYONE... That has some sort of consciousness.. Ah the Hard Problem of Consciousness.. That's really it. I suppose I do need to just focus on small bits and pieces and live a mundane slow pain
ful meaningless life. I needed more meaning than most at school.. Because I was smart.. I'm not sure if I'm STILL as smart as I was... But life in general - I can see through the game. ""Don't ruin our fun you robot"" !! - What? I'm just a really risky person.. I want to feel alive and need to be reminded often about gratitude and focus.. Rarely I get excited about anything.

175942352,"I was on Cipralex for anxiety and panic attacks- not depression- after caring for 5 1/2 yrs for my mom and her subsequent passing - from January 2018-10 mg till July 2020 and then went down to 5 mg. until September and went to 5 mg. every 2-3 days through September and first week of October stopped completely. My main complaint when I went down to every 2-3 days was dizziness and headachy and so my dr. said i was low enough to stop because she thought every 2-3 days may have had a yoyo effect . So since Oct. I am clear. Wasn't until about three weeks later I noticed the lightheadness had gone- thankfully and the headachy feeling. I had wafts of what i call the ""oh-ohs""- meaning here comes an attack but I could slow breathe them out and three weeks ago the oh-oh's came on while watching tv and disappeared just as fast- a gift from God I thought. Two weeks ago- now in November I ended up being stuck in traffic big time and it brought back the beginning of my anxiety from 2006 when i had a panic att

Since then I have had moments of intense trembling lasting for hours and having to take lorazapam only when I can't take the whirling head another second. - I am very, very careful with loraz. I am a master of breathing exercises, affirmations etc etc. My dr. thinks maybe i need to go back on. The cipralex worked for me and i don't want a benzo but i don't want to go back on either. I Hate the thought of start up effects too. Any thoughts most appreciated."

175942363,i cant. im always thinking about where i went wrong and revisiting every bad thing ive done. feel like im punishing myself for everything ive done even when i am not aware of it. some things about this is good tho because i feel like some people arent able to think about things the way they dont want to. even when i feel like im right about something or i want to blame someone for something i think about how theres a possibility its just me and things are the opposite of what i thought but maybe (how i imagine many people are) i was only able to see things from my own perspective in the moment (biased). idk where im going with this now i may be just rambling been noticing this for a while now i start thinking about one thing and by the time i can put the words together it doesnt match with what i feel like im trying to say so i try to make more sense of stuff but really i think no one will ever understand the feeling. i feel like if anyone could completely understand how i feel than theyd understand 
why i want to die sometimes and maybe see that if someone else was in my shoes theyd feel the same as suicide is not always just irrational thinking and sometimes even when you weigh out the good and bad and even give it time and try to improve mental conditions etc. to see if it will get rid of the feeling it still seems reasonable

i was so out of it, thinking that if i just passed the test they would let me out. it also drove me to be vegan thinking that i was being punished for earthly suffering so i had to change my ways. but to no avail, as i stayed in the hospital for 4 months before they let me out."

It can take a long time, YEARS, to find the perfect med for you that gives minimal to no side effects and manages your symptoms. But once you find those perfect meds, it is LIFE CHANGING. Seriously, you finally learn what it‚Äôs like to have a normal life and it‚Äôs like you dont have an illness anymore at all. No more suffering. So even if it takes years and you have to go through a lot of crap to find that good med combo it is sure as hell worth it."

It has a sedating effect and like lamictal its even effective enough to treat seizures. if so you want CBD which does not contain THC because even hemp plants in nature (that have not been manipulated by people to produce large amounts of THC) have very little THC and very little hallucinogenic effects. THC would make one more manic. But CBD oil sedates and might help you relax and not be so anxious. Good luck hope youre doing well."

He then proceeded to tell me that I don‚Äôt have it, which in fact I believe I do. I‚Äôm going to tell him next time I see him which is in a week.

175942609,"I saw my T on Saturday. She said if I get to feeling like I'm going to SUI that I need to talk to her first. To call the receptionist or the after hours people. The receptionist will be all like, she's booked for three and a half weeks but to give them my name and number and she'd fit me in on her lunch break or after hours. So that's nice there's something besides the ER. Because the ER hasn't been too helpful in the past."
174338299,"I‚Äôve been on abilify for nearly 6 years. There‚Äôs some evidence that abilify doesn‚Äôt stop working unlike other meds. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Aripiprazole may be free from tachyphylaxis: preliminary findings. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences , Mar 2012 Loss of antipsychotic efficacy (tachyphylaxis), possibly linked to an increase in D? receptor number and sensitivity, is a significant impediment to treatment in chronic schizophrenia patients. Animal studies, however, suggest that aripiprazole may be free from tachyphylaxis. The aim of the present study was to investigate this hypothesis. In this preliminary study, aripiprazole-treated patients were retrospectively investigated for the presence or absence of tachyphylaxis. Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores did not significantly change and there was no significant association of CGI scores with fixed dose duration. This suggests that aripiprazole may be free from tachyphylaxis."

175942628,"It seems really all I needed to be fully stable again was a job. Now that I am working full time my psychosis symptoms are practically nonexistent. I have only had 2 days out of the past couple months where I hallucinated. One day earlier in the week my notes looked like they were glowing. Then yesterday I kept seeing a person walking on the unit when no one was on the unit who would vanish after a second. It was a bit unnerving. But those are the only occasions. I used to get minor hallucinations like that almost every day. And I haven‚Äôt heard a word from the demons (outside of dreams) in like 2 months now, which is insane. My anxiety is normal now and I‚Äôm only stressing out over big things instead of things like leaving the house or getting dressed. I am doing so, so well. I am really someone who always needs to have a job. The routine of it and having something to ground me that requires all of my focus/attention is so important for me. Without it I just decompensate. When I told my doctor t
hat all I needed was a job he said he wished all his patients were like that, lol. Anyways thats the update on how I‚Äôve been doing! Bf and I are gonna get our first apartment tomorrow, I am so excited."

175942637,Really nervous to see the pdoc tomorrow. I think we have a bad relationship. That is why I scheduled an appt with another provider for Monday.

Finding jobs is not an easy task, and to find 30 jobs or more within that span of 10 years who wanted to employ me , I will say I did well. I wish I stuck with them but thats something I need to work on.

All human brains get upset with that and try to turn away. Its a natural part of life and even more serious for sz brains cos I think we feel emotions stronger. Fear, depression, anxiety etc. I cope with my stress either by not trying to turn away when I experience stress. That is easy to speak of but hard to practice. But once you get better with practice, there are benefits like less upset during stress and greater appreciation of non-stressful time. The little things that make you happy are more noticeable then and they add up to make your life more enjoyable. Like the coffee you have early in the morning and the joy you get from finished chores. Deep breathing and regular meditation are also good stress relievers."

175942887,It‚Äôs worth a shot if your symptoms are under control. Many recover from first episode psychosis and don‚Äôt need a life on meds. For me. I‚Äôve had multiple episodes and it‚Äôs not worth the risk. Meds for life for me.

175942901,"From about 35 to 40 there were two women straight out of college who liked me a lot but I was not in a good position in life living with my mother, and not being able to drive. I recognize now that I could have had a short term relationship with either of them as a companion. But more complicated stuff like marriage and children were just not good ideas. I assumed therefore it wouldn‚Äôt work and didn‚Äôt give either a chance to happen. I kinda wished I had opened up to them about my true situation and seen if they were still interested but as I see other people struggle with heartbreak, marriage and accidental children I have fewer regrets."
175942902,"Lol! I could never ask someone to go on a diet! If someone asked me that I would be pissed and then feel bad about myself. Maybe you could meet someone there.

175942903,When I don‚Äôt feel like talking I don‚Äôt talk. But is poverty of speech you can‚Äôt say anything good or having nothing to say. I‚Äôve been that way all my life. Listen to the people and that will give you something new to say.
175942904,"I had things happen to me as a youth too. I‚Äôve never told anyone about them though. And it‚Äôs pointless to now because nobody in my family would believe me. They‚Äôd tell me I‚Äôm delusional. Nothing as bad as what you have described in this post, but I was close to the offender. So the circumstance were different. I have odd things about my personality too. Like I can keep a Secret like a MF. I also have somewhat of a ‚Äòselective memory.‚Äô Like if I don‚Äôt like something, Ill just block it out like it never happened. I‚Äôll completely forget about it."

174338377,"Hey guys for awhile now ive suffered from a lot of drug addictions and mental health issues. I don‚Äôt touch drugs or alcohol (booze rarely) now and I still smoke though. This is my first post so I hope this is a good fit for me. I‚Äôve suffered from every kind of intrusive thought there is. I dont know whether or not people really are aware of these disturbing thoughts or if it‚Äôs just confirmation bias. For example if im in the doctors office and I have a violent or sexual thought ill notice a man cough just at the perfect time, and think oh ???? he can hear what I just said, he must think im an awful psychopath/pervert (but doesn‚Äôt he know I hate these thoughts and can‚Äôt help it?). I remember when I was in a gymnasium applying for the military there was bleachers full of Police Officers and I kept having offensive thoughts about cops and I swear every goddamn cop was staring at !ME with a smug/unimpressed jugemental look on their face. This was 4 years ago and it‚Äôs not any better. I curre
ntly moved out of my apartment and now I live at home again with my mom and her boyfriend. Everytime I leave my room i feel panicked and anxious and humiliation. Even in my room I still feel like they can hear my thoughts as I type this right now but its a lot less powerful behind a door in a closed off room. Is this a legitimate psychosis or are ‚Äúvibes‚Äù like a thing? I remember in high school how everyone would talk about ‚Äúvibes‚Äù. I mean it would suck if I did have pscyhosis and needed meds because I really want to do military/policing, but then again if I can‚Äôt function, I won‚Äôt have any life of any sorts. I tried medication for this before and I swear It never made me feel any better. I tried resperidone, haldol, Abilify, etc. I really am concerned that it is real. I went over to my ex girlfriends the other day and was outside her apartment block having a cigarette and I just kept yelling racial slurs in my head when this black girl walked up and I wasn‚Äôt giving her any kind of look but she s

Couldn't agree more, TBH I would go as far as to say that hearing voices is what the UN has branded as Cyber Torture, or as it's termed online as gang stalking, This IS what Schizophrenia IS in reality. as my own experiences with co-existing alongside it, and of many accounts told in front of my face around a table in a coffee show, and the NEED for the opposition do conduct their little games of discrediting, running a mock of the TI explanation in order for it to be discredited as not the truth, countless fake victims all upon social media platforms, which gives it away as many victims of this would not show their faces upon theses platforms in the first place. I think most people know this already like with COVID most people with common sense know this is a ploy or fake news. It's just we currently live in a society that will flat earth you for saying these things in the public domain. Things like this have happened before chid abuse is a clear open and shut one, others are more hidden 
amongst the woodwork due to not as much news coverage. When this does finally tank and burst wide open, we will know just who's got brain shrinkage. Want medications were in fact cases of medical GBH, what affected or disabled person was Zersetzung out of a home due to new Atos guidelines that were not realized within reality. Also, the live streaming almost revenge porn like humiliation game as a source of entertainment would be a form of modern slavery. So, as I say yes these things are indeed evil and the perp's involved knowingly as bad as human traffickers, as it to add towards their own reason, logic, or amusement. It takes someone like _PERSON_ to be brave enough to brand Cyber torture as a reality and not the result of delusional thinking, conspiracy online theories. A lot can happen within ten years, some could say a lot all ready happen within 10 months. Revenge for hire, via a proxy, Cyber mobbing, workplace mobbing, gang stalking, electronic harassment, conceive control are human rights abuses and 
not the fault of the chosen victim. But of the mentally of the groups political, social dynamics. _PERSON_ on the Psychological Torture of Assange & the importance of Individual Action - YouTube _PERSON_ 8th Feb, 2020."

175942979,"Abstract Cognitive impairments in learning and memory are core symptoms of schizophrenia, associated with reduced self-reported quality of life. The most effective treatment of cognitive impairments is drill and practice cognitive training. Still, to date no study has investigated the effect of varying the frequency of training on cognitive outcomes. Here we utilized a verbal memory based language learning task, tapping into implicit cognitive processes, to investigate the role of training intensity on learning rates in individuals with schizophrenia. Data from 47 participants across two studies was utilized, one with a daily training regimen over 5 days and the other with a more intensive schedule of 5 sessions delivered over 2 days. The primary outcome measure was the change in implicit learning performance across five sessions, quantified with the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Participants in the daily training group showed improved performance compared to the intensive group only at s
ession 4. This is the first study to show that implicit learning rates are influenced by training intensity, with daily sessions outperforming a more intensive regimen; a period of consolidation overnight may be necessary to optimize cognitive training for individuals with schizophrenia. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85686-5"

175942984,"I don‚Äôt normally get colds, or severe colds. However I have gotten strep throat before. I caught this strange flu in January and I believe I caught it from someone who had it worse than me. So maybe I just caught a bad flu. My symptoms: dry cough, fatigue, loss of smell and taste, hurts to cough, kind of sore throat, breathing problems, chills and having trouble sleeping. My friend had just gotten back from out of state, and I had a few other people around. I look at people on TV or recognize the virus just by looking at people who say they have it, that‚Äôs what it was like for me. Without getting a test to say if I was ever exposed to it I‚Äôll never know. I‚Äôve been on self-quarentine before it became a pandemic, but I am hopeful that if I was indeed exposed to it, I might be able to offer insight on how I recovered so quickly. I got better and no one around me got it. I really want them to solve this medical crisis. Hopefully they get the cure out soon."

Then she said I didn't because Possible trigger: I've not had sex this time she says it needs to be done this year. Figure it out woman! I have an appointment already scheduled for next week. Might keep that and try to get this done. Bleh. She kept asking me the same stuff and telling me the same stuff over and over. She seemed a little freaked out by the hallucinations. I thought she was going to send me back to the hospital. Maybe I'm paranoid. Or not. She couldn't believe the hospital let me out when I was hallucinating. I didn't tell her that I didn't tell them I was hallucinating. I tell T, and Pastor T, and the RN, and my Pdoc. And I told the ER at the second psych eval which I failed. I feel li

175943003,"This isn‚Äôt a constructive thread. Today has been a large step back in my progress and I‚Äôm feeling things I haven‚Äôt in a while. My ??????? grandmother is singing folk songs downstairs, she won‚Äôt shut up. This morning I got a minor slap on the wrist for posting something here and that small frustration has grown. Now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how much I hate myself. Update: I broke my keyboard and my right hand is bloody from it. I‚Äôm going to ??????? cry. I can‚Äôt find a part for my backup keyboard. I will never deserve the love I receive, it will always be misplaced, out of pity, or out of obligation. No one will ever really love me, how could they? I‚Äôm hideous. I‚Äôm jobless. I‚Äôm exhausted from trying to fix my conditions, I‚Äôm exhausted from doing anything - I‚Äôm just tired. Really, really tired. Any interests I had are ruined beyond recovery for me and I only find a meager amount of joy in them, which can be crushed like a grape. I will never be cute. NEVER. I can‚Äôt work, a
nd I wouldn‚Äôt survive in a society that didn‚Äôt take care of me financially. I can‚Äôt stop looking at my hand - look at my hand‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm already ugly and I keep deforming myself like this.LOOK AT MY ??????? HAND. I have to talk to a guy I might like later and not fall to pieces, which will just end up defaulting to the same small talk as always because that‚Äôs all I can manage without crying all over him for hours. How could I ever live with a spouse, or a child. I haven‚Äôt had fun today, I didn‚Äôt make any progress against my condition, I wasn‚Äôt useful, didn‚Äôt go to work or maintain the house, I did nothing but sit in my chair and fester. Today was wasted - thoroughly wasted, and it‚Äôs all my fault. I‚Äôm guilty of wasting this time. I‚Äôm a resource-sink that will never be satisfied. I‚Äôm a wretch with no place in the world. Too often the best I can manage in a day is to not destroy myself and my surroundings. I‚Äôm a child who will never grow up, who will never operate on the same level as an 
adult. Even when I try harder to do better the returns are pitiful compared to the exasperation of the effort. There is nothing that doesn‚Äôt diminish me and I don‚Äôt deserve to be alive"

I plan on getting off disability soon. It‚Äôs just temp work. Since I started volunteering, I showered and brushed my teeth a little more frequently instead of like once a month or two‚Ä¶lol. I think i like 4.5 vraylar and 40 mg of latuda better. I feel like once you get past 6 mg of vraylar, there‚Äôs less effectiveness overall. I feel like the positives are a little more manageable. I went from 10 monsters to 5 monsters to now back up to 8 (less than 10 still) since I started working. I feel like having latuda + vraylar hits more neurotransmitters, has a better mood stabilizing effect, and clears my head a bit. I still am a ?????? up person and guy and still disabled somewhat, but have improved overall. People in my family have seen my improvements, but I still got 100+ yards to go."

The only question is, do you want to do that now, before there is a lot of investment in the relationship, or do you wait and hope they're not angry for you not having divulged earlier? I used to wait. But I've changed. I decided it's better for me to be out there with this thing than to try to sneak it in later. If she freaks, then she obviously is not the girl for me.

175943046,"It can be a hard addiction to break. It helps to find a less destructive replacement behavior. some people will hold an ice cube in their hand until it hurts, and that is a less dangerous form of self harm that can be used as a stepping stone while you learn healthier coping skills. Some people draw on their bodies with a marker. They make a pretty picture over the skin they wanted to cut, and then they can look at the picture and see that they created instead of destroying. Some people exercise intensely, to release endorphins. Do you think any of these coping skills could be an option for you? Cutting is especially dangerous right now because there is a shortage of antiseptic, so it will be harder to properly clean and disinfect the wound.

You have an illness and seeking help is one of the best things you can do, not only for yourself, but for society. You aren‚Äôt a burden. You are a person with an illness and you contribute to your family love and support the best you can manage. Those whom pay taxes support those like you and me and our society forces them to pay those taxes because it could be any of them in our situation and the government knows people like us need the extra support, or we‚Äôll cost society even more by being problem individuals who aren‚Äôt treated and harm ourselves and or others during an outbreak of psychosis. Please never feel shame."

I wasn‚Äôt improving much and went for a mental health assessment. They felt it was stress and referred me to counseling if I needed it. I tried several things to reduce my anxiety. That helped some and then I started to get really vivid dreams and hearing things before falling asleep. Sometimes I get the same waking up. I was worried and signed myself into a psychatric hospital. They released me after an hour and said it was stress. That was over the summer and I‚Äôm still having the issues with my sleep. I‚Äôm not sure if this is early signs of schizophrenia or not. I still work and stay active. My anxiety is better than before, but I still don‚Äôt feel like myself."

(I‚Äôve been re-diagnosed with schizophrenia, by the way, and I‚Äôm still working at a company that has good insurance). The cost of the newer drugs wasn‚Äôt the issue for me. The issue is that I think the new drugs, for me, are crap, to put it very mildly. Maybe I‚Äôll find one that works for me. If someone is having trouble transitioning to newer drugs because of cost, I‚Äôm not sure what to do. If the person is desperate, maybe they could get samples or a coupon for newer drugs, and if the new drugs actually make them stable enough, they could seek employment with a company that offers insurance for when the coupons or samples run out. This is just a wild theory for the desperate. _AT_MENTION_ works. Maybe he has a better idea. Maybe other working people here have a better idea."

Last year January I just came back from a relapse and didnt work for almost 3months and was told I shouldnt work night shifts as it may have brought on a relapse. So I went through the process of seeking accommodation at the work and they now let me work the morning shift and there has been no rotation since then. Currently the work has a study program where they offer R50 000 to study through one of three private institutions, the only problem is they are classed based and the company actually has to make provision for these students to work night shift and attend the classes during the day(the insitution doesnt have day shift). I proposed they offer to pay for qualifications from the University of South Africa(UNISA) and they are open to exploring it for National Diploma‚Äôs(associate degrees) but not bachelors degrees, which is what I asked about. UNISA is a corresponde
nce university thats internationally accredited and highly in demand as a correspondence university I can actually study IT without needing to work night shift(which isnt an option), should I mention to HR that I have a medical condition which is in remission(not mention schizophrenia) and that to stay in remission I was advised to not work night shifts or should I say nothing and just pitch everything(with supporting documents) as a great addition to the companies course offering. Honestly think UNISA is 10 times better than the private colleges in terms of course work and recognition as well as employability so would like to see the company add it to their offerings for all."

175943212,That's the thing. My first hospitalization was when I was a senior in high school. I graduated high school and things got increasingly worse. I took almost full time hours at work and full time college... I switched schools and went to Cincinnati. Had a terrible episode and if things didn't happen the way they did I would probably be dead. I ended up in the hospital... for 2 weeks and then sent off to a homeless shelter because I refused to go home to my moms house because at the time he was mentally abuses and threaten to beat my ***. Then my ex's parents offered me to live with them. I eventually did. then after my mom seem to be more understanding I moved in with her... only on later that year my ex broke up with me. got on SSI and medicaid medicare.... After my ex broke up with me his and what was suppose to be my friend ended up stop taking to me and ended up hangout with my ex more and pretty much without inviting me to thing and such. I just haven't had much opportunities besides online and p
eople at the hospital to have much interaction with because things are bad. I'm not doing enough. I need to do this... I need to do that. I need to stop being a lazy ***** and do something with my life. I just want to die sometimes...but sometimes when things get too good it feels like it'll collapse and will go to hell. I dont want to feel like I did when I've been ghosted for talking about my family issues and that I was talking about suicide and that I'm a lost cause. Then there's other friends that ghosted too... I guess I'm not worth their time and energy.

KarXT is an oral co-formulation of xanomeline, a muscarinic receptor agonist, and trospium, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, which acts through preferential stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system. The experimental combination antipsychotic drug from Karuna Therapeutics did well in a mid-stage clinical trial, reducing acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. It also had a more profound impact on hallucinations and delusions, and on emotional and social withdrawal, than placebo.

175943314,"Hello all, I tried L-theanine for daytime supression of anxiety and intrusive thoughts and i think it did ok, you have to take about 1.5-2.5 grams per day to get the effects. I also tried taking it at night for better sleep, not so sure about how this has affected my sleep as I also have a CPAP to provide pressurized air at night. Now, from research 2-3 years ago, I am trying NAC, N-Acetylcysteine, which is supposed to balance out glutamate levels as well and work with the glutamate transporters, antiporters, etc. Again, you have to take 2-3 grams for effective relief in things such as intrusive thoughts, delusions of persecution, etc. What are you all finding out (Those who are taking either or) with these supplements? Do you like them? What are some side effects? Do you feel that they have changed your life to where you feel different when you don‚Äôt take them? I am asking because I am trying very hard, just like you all are, to find a ‚Äúcure‚Äù for the disease. Latuda, Lithium, Zoloft, NAC, Th
eanine, and multivitamins seem to be a good path so far. Thank you for your assistance, and I hope you all get well soon. Take care."

175943316,"Thank you, everyone. Tbh I don‚Äôt actually know what‚Äôs wrong with me yet, and I know this could just be rather extreme anxiety, but I don‚Äôt think even extreme anxiety will start making you believe that the inherent energy inside everything is malevolent towards you, can punish you, and make you start to actually see the energy and associated spirits moving around. It‚Äôs scaring the ???? out of me and taking all my strength to remind myself that it‚Äôs probably not real. Maybe this is just anxiety and I need stronger anti-anxiety pills, maybe I‚Äôm psychotic, idk but I do know I want this to stop."

This is not generic but the brand name. I am terrified that the formula will not be the same and I will experience symptoms.

175943353,Cool u are on meds. In the past I used to listen to them so much. They were also threatening me with a horrible hell if I don‚Äôt obey them so I was scared not to listen. But I think if I hear them again then I will try to reason with them more. I‚Äôm fed up of doing all their commands. I know someone who danced naked outside his house in order to show devotion to God so the voice told him. Somehow it doesn‚Äôt add up that these voices are truly that powerful to create a hell afterlife for me. But it takes courage to try and be assertive to them. I personally hope I can do it if I hear voices like that again

We all have it, and it progressed all throughout our lives, just like yours did (except, maybe, for those whose illnesses are drug or trauma induced). Yes, it‚Äôll take time, but if you keep telling yourself that your illness is so different, so much more severe, than mine or anyone else‚Äôs, then you‚Äôll hinder your own recovery. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre faking, I really don‚Äôt, but I do think you‚Äôre allowing yourself to wallow. The truth is that meds will help each of us to varying degrees, regardless of how long you‚Äôve been ill. There are people in hospitals who had their first psychotic break, and now nothing has been able to pull them back. There are people who were gravely ill for years, and then comes along 3mg of Vraylar and poof, they‚Äôre practically cured. I myself have never had a complete break because my mom has always been on 
top of my mental health. I‚Äôve gotten close, but never crossed that line, thanks to her and my grandpa. In theory, my meds should work perfectly, only they don‚Äôt. I still have hallucinations, albeit less vivid ones, all of the time, and I have delusional ideas and episodes. I have disorganized, formal thought disorder symptoms, and my cognitive symptoms are more prominent than my negative ones. There‚Äôs no formula for how each of us will respond meds, unfortunately. It‚Äôs just a roll of the dice. I‚Äôm not trying to be a bi tch, _NAME_. Perhaps if I am, then someone else can explain it in a gentler way. I‚Äôm just trying to be honest with you, because you need to understand the truth. You need to understand that sometimes, meds just aren‚Äôt enough. If you want your shot at a normal life, then you‚Äôre going to have to fight for it, and you‚Äôre going to have to fight harder than some others may have to. Yeah, it‚Äôs sh itty and it‚Äôs unfair, but that‚Äôs just the way it is, so you can either accept tha

Have always been anxious. Yes unwanted thoughts I do get every day but I dont know if I‚Äôm under an umbrella of different disorders.

I feel like Vyvanse focus is more clear minded like the power of a crystal (I know.. I.. know..) Anyways, it's like a selective clear focus. Concerta reminds me of a real focus - The focus that I complain about lacking almost every day on here about ""DOING THINGS"".. But Concerta wasn't as good at keeping me awake - Maybe like 50% as good - Added on to the fact that it doesn't last as long as Vyvanse. I slept on Adderall and was tempted to abuse it because it wasn't enough - I think the 25% levoamphetamine made my muscles dopamine movement ABLE which made me feel relaxed (I know that can't be a thing) but I had light dream sleep.. I take Vyvanse every morning, go back to sleep (My watch says that I get the most ""REM sleep"" during this time - Instead of just ""deep sleep"") and then I wake up. I know it's just comparison from a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (Concerta) com
pared to a dopamine releaser and reuptake inhibitor (Vyvanse) but I think it's because I build tolerance to Vyvanse while Concerta is lighter for long term - Although a doctor wanted to switch me to Vyvanse when I was 18 because ""It's better for the heart long term"". *The more you know*"

175943721,"From what I have read and heard: Your shadow self is the parts of your personality, good and bad, that you avoid thinking about and feeling. Often this is for social reasons. I have a problem with standing up for myself, it used to be really bad. Often when someone did something unacceptable or hurtful around me, instead of fixing the problem, I saw confrontation as bad and kept quiet, not feeling my emotions. However, when I was on my own later, the feelings come back and I would rage for 15 minutes about what happened. You would say being confrontational is part of my shadow self. To get past it, you need to acknowledge that it exists, understand why you are avoiding it, then find a way to deal with it without ignoring it."

And let me just say, if you don‚Äôt have anxiety, coffee works wonders for negatives when you have to stay alert"
175943766,"The therapy would be tailored to the client depending on what phase of their illness they were in and each phase would have different goals. Phase 1 goal would be to have the person start to question their beliefs. This is the one I‚Äôm still formulating how to do of course. Perhaps stabilizing on medication, then would involve going over all the experiences the person had and showing them how they connect to the symptoms of psychosis. For example, if the person had believed the CIA was coming to get them because they had superpowers. We‚Äôd go over that and how the belief of having superpowers is an example of a grandiose delusion, that the CIA is after them is an example of paranoia, both classic in psychosis. We would then go over what those symptoms meant, like how grandiose delusions help protect from feelings of uselessness and insignificance and paranoid delusions were the brain explaining the strong fear the psychotic brain produces randomly. We‚Äôd develop alternative coping methods for th
ese things and work on changing some thought processes. There would be reading provided or if reading was difficult for the patient we‚Äôd go over in session stories about other people with psychosis who had very similar symptoms. It would be excellent if I could facilitate some kind of group where people with psychosis could connect and see similarities between their symptoms. Phase 2 goal is to get the person to come to accept their illness and to maintain treatment. We‚Äôd look at patterns of what happened before when quitting treatment. If possible we‚Äôd go over diary entries of the patient while ill or maybe even recordings so they could see what they were like off treatment. Knowing warning signs that illness was returning so that they could recognize whenever they went off meds that oh I do have an illness because I recognize it coming back. Phase 3 goal would be recovery and then maintenance of stability. Involves dealing with any symptoms on a day to day basis, tweaking meds when necessary, monitori
ng symptoms, etc."

175943769,"thanks for the replies everyone! Not sure if i have to move‚Äìit depends on who buys this house and tbh it isn‚Äôt even up to code and requires a ton of repairs, which is another reason why im angry at the slumlord lol. so that is stressful, my (ex) friend first said he‚Äôd sign a lease for me and my cousin to live in a two bedroom bcuz he has $ and good credit, but he got weird about my little cousin who is in her 20‚Äôs so i told him he was being really weird about her and then he denied it and backed out. so, now i am struggling to find a new place bcuz i want out of this place regardless if it sells to a new landlord. bad credit tho. and unemployed at the moment, so yea‚Ä¶my cousin is working but she has no credit or rental history so we‚Äôre like a terrible pair to try to get housing on our own lol i def agree that mental illness wrecks our natural development. i do like that i have a youthful outlook like cat videos on youtube bring me much joy that surpasses every day stress lol. The buyers 
cancelled today thank GOODNESS! especially because my friend just donated like 200 books for my neighborhood the other day, so the living room looks like im a book hoarder at the moment lol. This is the second time, but what i do is put out books along the street with a sign that says free books and it‚Äôs because i live in low income neighborhood and i figured people would enjoy something to read for free during the quarantine. so my friend heard i had done that and donated a bunch of books to me this week so i can leave them out for neighbors! *i live in very low income high crime neighborhood, and she lives in very wealthy area so it made sense to have me put them out front of my house now i can focus on the book drop and not worry about buyers lol"

175943776,"It was just phenibut withdrawal.. But it makes sensible things to be mad about more realistic. I took 1.25g because I didn't take 0.5g yesterday. Feeling a lot better and able to articulate how I'm feeling. I've noticed that when people are irritable, annoyed, agitated, anxious, moody, etc.. They can't articulate how they're actually feeling. Phenibut allows me to do that except it also increases my mood so.. I could be having the worst things happening to me and I'd still be happy.. So that makes me realize that overly positive people have flaws too.. They don't notice how bad things really are.. Nihilism is ok in small doses.. Then I think, should it vary in life? Should we experience all of these different emotions at different times and instead feel happy, sad, anxious, etc? Yes.. And at least with bipolar, there's hypomania which people like and prefer to stay in.. Maybe it's the most sane and rational one... Yet people can enjoy depression and make good art.. Some people are constantly manic 
and people call them crazy.. But in anthropological terms, they seem to be the people that are most social and good because they don't feel the need to put others down to feel better cuz they already feel better.. Narcissists delude themselves by blaming other people, gaslighting and seeing themselves as the best.. MDMA made me feel very sad and happy rapid cycling for 6 days. I cried 50 times a day over small things. If that is what bipolar is like, I'd see it as a gift even though I'd want to take meds.. but at a low dose.. Addiction summons all sorts of shallow positive emotions and negative severe realistic bad/unwanted emotions. I go through it all. And apparently there's 44000 emotions identified.. I always said that I feel like 40 different emotions every week and it's true..."
