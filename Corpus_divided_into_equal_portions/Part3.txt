175893470,"Well, isolated people ruminate and worry too much and think too much. It‚Äôs taking action and taking risks that is going to change your lot in life. Get out and take a short walk, go to an empty restaurant for a meal, go sit in the park, go to a quiet, stress free library for a half hour. Just start off slow and take small steps and make little changes and your life will improve. It‚Äôs up to you, the ball is in your court. No one is going to come knocking at your door and make you change your life, you have to go after it and do it yourself. Actually, there are people who want to help you and help you change your life. But you have to do your part and seek these people out. Change can be scary and you may fail but at least if you take a risk and fail, you will at least know in your heart that you tried. And then you rest up and try again. And again. And again. And again. You‚Äôre not going to solve your problems by sitting in your apartment and just thinking about all of them for another 5, 10 or 
15 years. You need to make a plan and write down some goals and then do your best to fulfil them. Hell, my life is full of failures, I fail every day, multiple times a day. But I often win too. I‚Äôve had huge failures and huge mistakes but I keep going because I don‚Äôt like the alternative: giving up. I‚Äôm not criticizing you I‚Äôm just saying that I‚Äôve isolated at different times in my life and I know how bad it is. But I keep going. I hope this all makes sense and you get something out of it. There‚Äôs no shame in failing or losing if you know that at least you gave it an honest try."

175893479,"_USER_ID_ said... _PERSON_, having a home can be costly at times. If your roof has damage due to storms or wind, you can file a claim on your homeowners insurance to help with the roof cost. If you make the repairs you have mentioned, why sell it. You will have everything taken care of, your home is an investment. Renting is expensive & you are giving someone else your hard earned money. My daughter & her husband rented for 5 years from a man. He jacked up the rent every year when it was time to renew their lease. They just bought a home & moved into it a couple of weeks ago. Buying the house was cheaper than their rent. If you sell, then rent & then decide to buy again, keep in mind real estate goes up it rarely comes down. Depending on what you can afford, you could end up with a home that needs repairs. Then you may find keeping your home would have been a better idea. Take on your repairs one at a time. Get multiple estimates on the gutters. If you have a Home Depot close by, they have independ
ent contractors that can install the gutters. Good luck. Thank you for your post. I just rather not deal with maintenance and all that stuff. A lot of the stuff I have fixed in my house, I won't see that money back. The only exception would something major like a new roof. Even though rent is a bit more expensive, if something breaks then I won't be responsible for fixing it. Also stuff like taxes and insurance go up to. I Guess there is no free lunch. Plus I don't know IF I want to stay in this area long term so I don't wanna be tied down forever"

174327595,"why did you stop Abilify if it was helping you? the med didnt really improve me it just kept my symptoms at bay, it was up to me to improve my situation, When i was on risperidone it was holding me back, i think sometimes when we take these meds they can actually hold us back, i changed to my new med 10 years ago and i sort of struck gold bc the med didnt hold me back as much and i was able to improve on it, i take an extremely low dose now and i feel i am making progress, i reduced my med further a few weeks ago and its been ok. i think my situation is unique though, everybodies brain is wired differently."

175893495,How are you doing without taking meds?
175893496,"It takes time to know and realize the condition. After which there is doubt. I all ways follow a quote given by my pdoc. ‚ÄúLess knowledge, is the worlds end‚Äù He was pointing it out when I started to research on this condition. Then I stopped it and believed the pdoc and did my thing. Yes it took away many years of my growth. The great thing thats happening now is I just do what interest me and the people who hate me stopped any harm as I cannot remember what they have done even when I had pointed it before. I do what I like without doubt."
175893497,"Of my symptoms for my pdoc. I don‚Äôt hallucinate regularly, have blackouts, or nightmares anymore. Things are looking good.

175893499,"My most debilitating delusions went away after a few months on an AP. Then came delusions that didn‚Äôt seem so much like delusions at the time as they mimicked legitimate beliefs held by some non-szs. These delusions seemed to serve to lend greater context to my previous delusions which I guess I hadn‚Äôt truly let go of yet. Eventually these left me too. I‚Äôve been free of them for over a year now. I still have social paranoia but my therapist has said that could just be anxiety. We‚Äôre still figuring that out. Stopping your meds without a doctor‚Äôs permission would just lead to misery, trust me."

175893504,I have had the voices go completely away twice. The first time I felt very lonely without them. It still sucked when they came back because they returned full force. The second time I was happy that they were gone but knew they would probably come back. When they did it wasn‚Äôt quite as bad.

175893514,Yeah. I went from sleeping 10 hours a day to 8 or less simply by adding a lot of exercise. It‚Äôs hard but works. First thing is set an alarm. My alarm is for 5 am but I‚Äôm up most days before it. It doesn‚Äôt mean I may need a short nap during the day depending on what I‚Äôm doing but a 20 minute nap is better than 2 more hours of sleep. I like mornings. It‚Äôs quiet where I‚Äôm at and I watch a lot of bad television and do exercise before my dad gets up. Honestly it‚Äôs hard but routine really serves my lifestyle and health well.

I'm scared of people who will belittle and harass me on the job. I'm scared of being stuck in a dead end job. I'm scared of being responsible for mistakes and situations I cannot control no matter how hard I try or how stressed I get. I want to just work someplace that will not take advantage of me or throw me to the wolves at the first sign of trouble. I'm not sure I can do anything but be in professional sales either.

175893580,I understand that worrying can overwhelm your mind. Honestly there is nothing you can do about the next president elect. I would suggest writing down your thoughts/worries and decide what you can change/influence through your life. The ones you cannot maybe put on the shelf. Then maybe start/be the change you want to see in your neighborhood/community/city/state and the world. I try to keep focus on things I can change. Or maybe you could try some cognitive therapy to help with worry. Just a few thoughts

Whether he is abusing them or not, there is no net treatment effect for long-term or pervasive anxiety, or anxiety-related symptoms such as restlessness. And addiction can come without abuse - dependency can be a form of addiction. With regular use of benzodiazepines, you will always develop a dependency. It‚Äôs best to listen to your doctor instead of shopping around for one who will do exactly as you want. If a doctor refuses to prescribe a med, and refuses to refer you to another doctor who will, they usually have a good reason for this. It‚Äôs not just an opinion, it‚Äôs based on actual evidence. A doctor that will prescribe the same med, on the other hand, could just as well be doing that because they lack the same knowledge.

175893618,"_AT_MENTION_, one of ""Them"" certainly appears to be Bill _PERSON_. Bill _PERSON_‚Äîthrough a complex tangle of direct and indirect funding mechanisms that includes being the World Health Organization‚Äôs (WHO‚Äôs) second largest donor‚Äî is gleefully leading the contingent promoting planet-wide coronavirus vaccination, unashamedly asserting that a vaccine ‚Äúis the only thing that will allow us to return to normal.‚Äù _PERSON_ has the effrontery to make such claims despite financial conflicts of interest blatant enough to be noticed even by the credulous, and a lengthy trail of vaccine-related destruction left in the wake of _PERSON_-funded vaccine programs around the world. Huge Financial Incentive for Doctors and Hospitals to Diagnose all Illnesses as COVID-19: Last week, Minnesota State Senator _NAME_, MD, told Fox News that Medicare pays $13,000 to hospitals for COVID-19 admissions and $39,000 if they are placed on ventilators. The money is a one-time lump-sum payment Some hospitals have a pa
y-share plan with their staff doctors, which means there is strong incentive to call everything COVID-19 Since these are single, lump-sum payments, treating a patient with one 30-minute session produces as much revenue as treating the same patient twenty or more over many days. Therefore, it is incredibly profitable to diagnose those with very light symptoms as COVID-19, give them 30 minutes on a ventilator, send them home, hook up the next patient for 30 minutes, and so-on.

The microneedle technology is also being wed to injectable technology, funded by the Bill and _NAME_ Gates Foundation, 
which embeds under the skin a vaccination record visible by near infrared light that can be read by smartphone technology.

In fact, by 2018, 70% of global polio cases were vaccine strain. In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by Glaxo _NAME_ (GSK) and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that _PERSON_-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls.

175893620,"I have for a while have been active with friends, going to church, going shopping, helping them cook lunch, when I move and settle down, I will go to the park and go grocery shopping often, I will try to keep up with my diet too."
175893621,"Possible trigger: I spent some time crying, listening to music. Then spent some time being suicidal, and looking up quotes about suicide. I feel a bit better. I suppose this is just how life goes. I feel like reality and love are fake, yet have some hope to keep me holding on. I wish I could let go - Because I don't think or feel that life is really worth it. But I'll just have to keep going and let what ever happens, happen. Life is really going to have to surprise me with some type of ecstasy. Or I should take ecstasy. Time will tell. I've been in so much mental pain and confusion that I can't take it anymore. But I'll wake up tomorrow and maybe this haunting dark cloud will go away. My cat was here to comfort me at least."
175893622,"I get that you might feel like the serious of your illness is not recognized by other people. Nobody can really know unless they experience something similar themselves. But also if you live many people under the same roof you all need to adapt to each other and cooperate to get along. I would try not to think that when one of your family members asks you to adapt it means that they don‚Äôt care about you. It‚Äôs difficult to live many people under the same roof. I totally get that from personal experience. It‚Äôs easy to get on each others nerves, but a lot of it has to do with how we choose to interpit and deal with things in our mind. But if you have no choice I would just try to stay away from that dark corner in your mind which makes you think that everything is impossible and instead try to brush things off as minor issues."

174327642,Hi I‚Äôm am on abilify 300mg and I keep forgetting things. It is so frustrating. I dont know what to do tbh.it makes me very anxious that I start forgetting things and I feel like I cannot concentrate. I have tryed supplement but they do not work very well I have been on this medication for about a year and it seems to be getting worse. I write things down on a peice of paper and then I still forget it.
175893688,Yeah when im just whispering to myself about a real problem it helps me gain perspective/stay grounded too.
174327646,"Not asking a bunch of mentally ill to diagnose me just trying to get background and perspective from those who have been there. Many would call it research I call it learning from the wise. I wanted to new a pilot bad when I was younger a pilot or aeronautical engineer were my goals but then life hit and it took everything I had to keep it from falling apart. Regardless, it fell apart more than once and I picked up the pieces to move on. Now, again, I have a good job and life and see the old symptoms coming back the precursor to what has happened before when things got bad. The panic attacks threw paranoia the weeks between showers or shaving the clinging to spritualistic ideals to justify my fears and the conspiracy against me. I struggle daily to hold back my temper and deal with others on their idea of what is real I constantly monitor what I say hoping that nowhere nobody thinks im crazy when I talk about the alternate examinations for aliens or why I‚Äôm so strong or so different from all of t
hem I‚Äôve searched diligently for years for something to put all the pieces together so I could understand what was happening.

174327651,"it seems too common for people to say a drug caused their schizophrenia, if they caused schizophrenia than there would be almost no non schizophrenic people left alive, if you get permanent psychotic symptoms and think its from any drug, it was going to happen anyways, genetic predisposition. maybe it would have been triggered later but something in your life lead to consuming it and theres no way to change the past so even if it was intentional it cant be changed and if the sz isn‚Äôt gone after discontinuing, theres not much you can do other than try to get better, its not good for your mind to try to blame something for why you are the way you are"

175893708,"Porn can be a form of sex education but it is usually combined with an assessment of the state of the pecking order in society which is where it differs from pure education and becomes propaganda. Masturbating to porn occurs precisely because it is propaganda and not education, no one masturbates to education unless they think it is a load of BS. Masturbating or ‚ÄúMaster Baiting‚Äù is a form of self empowerment, male chimps who wish to contend for the crown often go into seclusion and masturbate for years before challenging the dominant male. It can also be directed towards spiritual empowerment, but that is somewhat occult, and I don‚Äôt want to expand on that here. News differs from propaganda in either its truthfulness or immediacy, with true propaganda usually pointing to the future. Being against porn is too crude a position in this day and age, there are numerous studies that link it to decrease in violence towards women in the society at large, whereas the actual actresses have a life expec
tancy of 36 years, something which has to change. To my mind what is needed is a clear distinction between news, propaganda and education, but hasn‚Äôt that always been the issue with the press and media at large. We live in the internet age, what can we do;?;"
174327652,Good for you _AT_MENTION_ ! Best of luck!
175893709,"Awesome! Here's a piece of cool advice I gave to myself you can use it too for this situation of getting out of the psych ward; ‚ÄúIt's just a thing that happens. There's alway many ways to get better.. just not knowing how.. How are other people well? Their brains are working properly.. You can't give up. Keep surviving. Maybe you don't have the proper treatment team, the right meds, something bad happened to you which you're currently thinking about.. and then there's the maintaining on top of all of those things like taking care of yourself mentally and physically like anyone else would. It's a load of crap that you need to think about on top of mental illness and how to deal with it and be better (But you're just maintaining not going off into the deep end). It's a lot of work. Then people judge you for what you do and you have thoughts of outside forces playing you like a game. Everything can be really beautiful, calm, awakening and full of life experience. No one wants to die when the afterli
fe is a mystery or whether or not it even exists.. if it doesn't exist, then everything that is your ego is what wants to stay alive and the only thing that makes you want to die is the pain. It can feel like when you're in the state of feeling dysphoric and having paranoia and delusions that you'll be this way forever with periods of just being ""OK"" in between so like, ""Is it worth it?"". It always is. It's not a choice because you never know if you're dead. Try doing things to distract yourself (Coping mechanisms) like making tea, just sitting down and thinking even though it's agony because your brain is trying to figure things out along with the chemical imbalance. Depression and psychosis is a form of addiction because you're always constantly stuck in a loop, feeding off itself. If there was a way to reset the brain to default mode, you'd see that everything that you are can be changed. We're constantly changing and you don't have to be stuck in the hell that you're in.‚Äù"

174327659,"Well things have been a little crazy. I‚Äôm on break now from school which has been lovely and much needed. I‚Äôm dreading going back really! But I just have one semester left which is both exciting and nerve wracking because it means the job hunt has to begin. I am so scared that I will not find a job. That I will just apply and apply and never hear back like what happened to me when I applied for psych tech jobs. I already haven‚Äôt heard back at all from one place I applied to despite having applied like a month ago. I‚Äôm also very stressed about having to deal with job searching and school at the same time-most of the residency apps dont open up until school has already started again. I‚Äôm stressed about the trips I will be taking and being apart from my boyfriend‚Ä¶I‚Äôm stressed about my sudden increase in bladder issues‚Ä¶its so bad guys‚Ä¶I cant roll over at night or be still for 5 seconds without having to pee and feeling very uncomfortable. I can take as many as 5 trips to the bathroom 
in the process of trying to go to sleep and wake up multiple times a night having to repeat the 5 or so trips each time before I can fall back asleep. I am absolutely exhausted. I am going to get tested for a UTI but I found out frequent urination is also a side effect of the new weight loss med I am on. Which since i already have overactive bladder that may mean i just cannot tolerate this med. I‚Äôm already in communication with my doctor about it, I just feel I can‚Äôt catch a break‚Ä¶ I have also been losing control over my diet‚Ä¶my gung ho motivation to cook every meal and fast has died after 1 week and I am back to having no motivation and just wanting to eat out or eat easy junk‚Ä¶my weight loss has come to a halt as a result. At least my weight loss med is making me eat less but idk how much longer I‚Äôll be on it with the pee problem its causing me. I also just hate having to give myself a shot every day honestly. Anyways things are tough. I just want to skip to the part in life where I have my job 
and am secure, have money, and am happily living with my boyfriend. I feel guilty and awkward spending so much time with him at his moms house I‚Äôve basically moved in. On top of this I‚Äôve been getting incidences where the demons have come back to harass me. Last night I experienced getting pulled out of my body and getting dragged around the bed. I was watching myself sleeping which was so weird. Then whatever was grabbing my leg and dragging me started licking and sucking on my foot and I got a vision of what it was and it was so terrifying looking I freaked out and snapped awake or back in my body or whatever. Outside of that they have been coming to me awake and trying to harass me. I told my doctor but he said it will pass and we aren‚Äôt going up on my rexulti. So I dunno."

175893719,"Hey _PERSON_, Welcome I really suggest not trying to ignore your thoughts because simply, you can't do that. The more you try to do that the more you are gonna think. Instead, how about acknowledging them, accepting them without putting any label on them? Practice this everyday whenever you pay attention to your thoughts, just notice them. Don't label them, don't judge them, don't personalize them, never take them personal. Let's say those are audible thoughts of someone else and you are just hearing what they are saying. It will feel like you are listening to someone else speaking and you don't have any opinion or judgement on what they are saying. I have a very busy mind, I overthink. But now I am trying to practice letting my thoughts go without giving them too much credit. Hope you feel better soon."

175893727,"What is a simulation? If you mean there is a real world and a simulated world then no, there is no, imho, simulation ( #1 ). E.g.The _NAME_ Show starring _NAME_ is about a guy that lives in a simulated ( #1 ) world, but there is a real world. If you think you are _NAME_ (the character played by _NAME_), then imho you are wrong. There is no other real world that you are not a part of. However, there is another use of the world simulation ( #2 ), used in science, meaning a theory. There are some scientists (e.g. Mr. Speed-of-Sound, _NAME_) that argue that the real world is a theory or simulation ( #2 ). If such scientists are right then we are all living in a #2 simulation. For example, do centres of gravity exist? Most people would say, I think, that centres of gravity are theoretical entities that help us understand how objects behave when they are, e.g. hung up by a piece of string. There is no existent centre of gravity in things ‚Äì no matter how finely you chop things up you will never find a c
entre of gravity lump ‚Äì but the theoretical entity is useful. _NAME_ says that the self, (‚ÄúI‚Äù who we think we are) are like centres of gravity. Theories about something, our mind, that has in fact no existent centre. But there are others that go further. _NAME_ (as in ‚ÄúMach 1‚Äù = the speed of sound), who claims that everything, including ‚Äúobjects‚Äù and atoms, are theories about our sensations, especially our visual field. _PERSON_ claims that the (Kantian) ‚Äúthing in itself‚Äù is unnecessary. We just have a lot of theories, or simulations. If so then, in that sense, we all live in a simulation, but most people are unaware of it. Most people are unaware of the fact that we live in a theoretical, centre-of-gravity-like world, imho."

174327670,"Drugs have nasty side effects and interactions with meds, sometimes life-threatening. Abilify made my libido way above normal, I was hypersexual while on it that‚Äôs why I switched to Latuda. MDMA excites dopaminergic neurons while antipsychotics blocks dopaminergic neurons. That caused your symptoms of psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia etc. You should never do drugs especially if you are medicated. It might be fun one time or two but most of the time you will have bad trips, bad side effects and bad meds interactions especially if you have SZ. Also you take a risk of becoming addicted to it financially and psychologically. MDMA increases libido, makes you hypersexual which is bad. Its possible that your libido is low now because your brain is used to more dopamine of the MDMA. When you stopped it, your libido went down. Don‚Äôt be scared, your body will readjust and if it doesn‚Äôt, change to an antipsychotic that doesn‚Äôt lowers libido as much as Risperdone. I was offered drugs many times, I a

Let's hope my days off arent ruined and it wont turn into a 3 day migraine. With my back hurting on top of all that. I didnt have time to make a doctor appt with a new doctor. I woke up at 11am and had stuff to do until about now at 430pm. And doctors are closing now. I'll wait because I'm not paying out of pocket again for the only urgent care place I can goto. They charge 70 flat fee for just a visit, and then charges go up based on if u need medicine or xray or anything, etc. They dont take insurance. But no emergency rooms here take my insurance and last time I went to one they wanted 1000 upfront. So I left. The only option is medical hospital that has a emergency room attached and i cant afford that long term. I talked to fiance ab
out _NAME_ many months ago and he didnt even care. Now he told me his friend told him about _NAME_ baby steps. So we are gonna try that now. at least he listened to his friend I guess. Anyway, and I signed up for 3 classes for college in january. 25 dollars upfront and 400 per class after its over, IF I pass any of them. I can retake and retake for free til i pass. Then i gotta pay. I should scale back my schedule a bit. For the life of me, and my mental healths sake. I tried not to go completely broke today, just in case. Anyway. My busy week is over. So that's relieving. And I didnt do a couple of things that was on my schedule. Like the poetry jam and political webinar. I had to rest, badly."

It sounds like it would be a good idea to go back on it, since you said it was like you didn‚Äôt even have negative symptoms while you were on it. It can‚Äôt hurt to try. Talk to your pdoc about resuming it if you want. I used to be like you described when I was on Haldol. I spent countless hours in bed just staring at the wall or ceiling. Now on Zyprexa I have lots of energy and get a lot more done."

I think were all searching for a magic pill to solve our problems (not just schizophrenics, everyone) and i dont think it exists. In a few months theyre probably going to have some ‚Äúnew supplement that ‚Äòscientists‚Äô are promoting‚Äù. Honestly natural foods really are the most convenient way i think. Sure taking 6 brocolli pills a day sounds easier, but then theyre probably best with vitamin c, now were taking a suppliment for that, then ‚Äòresearch shows that taking it with fibre increases its effectiveness‚Äô so were taking a fibre pill‚Ä¶then we read that its best consumed in a liquid form with vitamin e because it protects the plants antioxiant properties Lol And in the end i think we are faced with a handful of pills emulating essentially the natural food itself which contains this substance, iron, vitamin c, antioxidants, etc"

174327687,"Sorry Desoxyn, just saw this thread realized you didn't get any replies. To be honest, what helped my negative symptoms is vraylar. I have much more motivation now. Strangely enough seroquel has also helped, once it was increased to 600 I have tons of energy and feel motivated and happy about things again. Which is weird because on lower doses I felt like a zombie who didn't care or get excited about anything in life. I know everyone experiences things differently though. Hope you find something to help you. I agree with the hobby thing, pushing through resistance to doing things is hard but I find once you get started it's easier to keep going. So sometimes you can't wait for the motivation to do things because it may never arrive and the more you avoid things,at least from my experience the harder it gets, you have to start and the motivation often come afterwards"

With the advent of social distancing and COVID, digital self-help forums seem unable to fulfill their objectives when there most needed, some are openly sickening and abusive, something of which mimics the abuse some of us have to endure within the live streaming of 'voices' directed at us, and the daily unnerving reality of hidden or interpersonal ambient abuse within our perception of daily life, as common as these experiences are amongst us, it is something that is actively denied out in the open, even though you know it's real 
and very degrading to be subjected too. PTSD is a great deal that most of us actually have though it's rebranded as psychosis, even the harassment live streaming of our silent speech or subvocalization is viewed and deemed as a clear sign of illness or deluded thinking. I keep reminding myself that there is no anti-harassment tablet, there is no anti-abuse medication, no anti-cyber assault treatment. That could be said about online resources as well, as they could consist of youtube groomers, phishing e-mails by fake profiles, mouse trap support forums, and zoom bombing fake meetings. So, what would you do as the game is one of dead-end resources?

The medicine ive been taking for managing my anxiety for 8 months , lexapro 20 mg, has suddenly last week started causing this acute agitation built up like a ball of energy coursing inside knocking and pushing to get out. So i stopped taking my med for 4 days. And everything went back to normal. So i gathered its dose related and started back on 10mg. Things went smooth for 3 days and i woke up today in the 4 th day feeling the same agitation less intense. My doc wants to put me on lithium. Says this is med induced mania. So lithium. My question is, worry and concern is whether switching the ssri would help. Like people say their meds are too activating. Too agitating. They try switching ssris rather than starting lithium right away. Can you guys share your experience, advice suggestions..so i can have all the information to make the next decision right way.

I have used AD:s like Lexapro (Cipralex) , Duloxetine and Venlafaxine before, i was allergetic to Venlafaxine, Duloxetine didnt have strong effect on me and with Lexapro i started drinking much alcohol because Lexapro combined with alcohol made me feel over happy and i did
nt get bad hangovers anymore. So, so far only real benefit from Lexapro. Im switching my pdoc at this time and im going to ask Trintellix from my new pdoc, not sure will he/she presprict it to me but im going to talk about it. Interested to hear your thoughts about my situation and Trintellix overall. Wish you the best and im new to this forum as its my first comment here"
175893985,I didn‚Äôt take a nap yesterday and today is a bad day. So I might be onto something. However yesterday I went into town to get my meds so it could be that too as I rarely leave the house.
175893986,Im ok with that
175893987,I end up oversharing.
175893989,There's 15 minutes left of work today and there's no coworkers around to talk to. I must be feeling a little better if I am talkative because I am not talkative when I am depressed. If I am bemoaning the fact that there are no coworkers around to talk to then I must really be feeling better.
175893990,And there‚Äôs stuff that can‚Äôt wait any longer. Tomorrow I just have to kick myself in the butt and get it done. Everything seems unattainable. Why do I have to be this way? I feel lost. This disease is so unforgiving.
175893991,"Oh wow, that's nice! Enjoy!"
174327713,"On 10mg it mostly dealt with my positive symptoms. It gave me akathisia though and I would do a lot of pacing and walking in the morning after taking the tablet. My doc upped me to 20mg briefly and that gave me severe akathisia. I couldn‚Äôt tolerate caffeine on it either and went without caffeine for 6 months. Like most of the new ap‚Äôs, If you need a change it is worth a try."
175893992,"You have my empathy. Been in your shoes, and don‚Äôt envy your position. It‚Äôs a tough time for everybody, for sure. Not going to make this about me, so I‚Äôll just offer this: Don‚Äôt wind up with unanswered questions or having hurt feelings (this applies to you and your mom)."

175893994,"thanks guy, it felt good to take shower, i havent took a shower in 5 days. i felt so gross. i still cant belive i lost like 9 pounds, i ate alot too."
175893995,"I cant really say, never had sleep issues and never tried sleeping aids. But I dont think Melatonin, chamomile and lavender cause issues, many on the forum take Melatonin."

175893996,Oh does he?? sorry didn‚Äôt know that
175893997,"Wow, 10 years, that‚Äôs awesome! Good for you!"
175893998,"Hi _PERSON_, Good luck with going off of the medications. I hope it goes well for you. My week went well. Did a lot of walking and trying to clean house. I am not the best at that. It goes in spurts I guess. Seeing my psychologist on the 20th of this month. None too soon. The insurance people wont give me as much medication as I need. So it has been a little tough lately. I think we are going to try adding something to the mix, if the insurance company will pay for it. We'll see. This is the first time I have ever had an insurance company deny me medications that I need. I hope you all are having a good week. I have had better but trying not to complain as the weather has been nice. Somewhat cooler. Reminds me of fall which is my favorite season. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175893999,"I guess. No one believes me. Its outlandish I know. But the fear is there. Even felt like the real _NAME_ bourne, but that was before my time and not me. Its fake. Obviously. I just know a lot of super soldiers feel like that. I‚Äôm scared."
175894000,I can totally relate. I loved science and math had so many creative endeavors planned when I was learning new concepts. I as well hallucinated people crying. Like literally eyes bloodshot bawling their eyes out. I also at first heard voices of people near me. Now it‚Äôs more stuff to make me paranoid. But I feel like I‚Äôm seeing past it
175894001,"Thanks for the support, everyone. I am going to try to stay on my meds. I messaged my pdoc yesterday evening, and she got back to me right away. She is upping my vraylar from 3mg to 4.5mg. And yes, _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ , I do have TD. You make a good point. I just took my morning meds. They will knock me out for 2-4 hours. Sucks."
174327724,I‚Äôve always thought antipsychotics caused negative symptoms. I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt research that
175894002,"I think they have proven that time can be traveled backwards in small increments, but nowhere near enough to significantly alter the future. I think it has something to do with black holes."

Is kicking a nurse when they overwhelm you with 6 persons in the public space to undress you and forcefully drug you, when you were quietly praying in the garden, violence? Is saying horrible things to someone (who does the same to you) violence? I think i was verbally ‚Äúviolent‚Äù in a few occasions, and it was mutual.

175894078,I reckon it‚Äôs easier to be ignorant to external voices (after a while to ignore them). Internal voices are much more intelligent depending what medication you take. It probably varies from person to person. I looked up article that states everyone has a severity on different levels.

Saw the doctor today and she said to wait till end of March when the weather picks up and I'm outdoors more. I take Cipralex not for depression but anxiety with a few panic attacks but have weathered a few storms. I am on 10 mg. and she suggested I start off going down to 5 mg for a couple of weeks or so and see how that works. Funny, I was scared silly to start it and that's when I found this website and the site helped a lot but now I am scared silly to go off it. I did try to find the old recipe that was offered but couldn't but appreciate that though we all handle these things differently that you had no problems. Thanks again!"

Let me tell you why, out of all the majors I‚Äôve been through why I haven‚Äôt, and why I WON‚ÄôT ever. My intention isn‚Äôt to build a career directly in the mental health field. There‚Äôs nothing for me there. I don‚Äôt want to build a career directly into a field that I will, I feel like, steer me into a direction that is laden with old systemic theories and functions. This is mostly coming from a consumer point-of-view, because I have been in the mental health system for two decades and counting. The channels that someone has to go through to get where they should be in recovery is usually watered down with old systemic functions. Which makes things a lot harder and a lot longer for the person to get where they need to be in recovery. Of course, you can do other things with a psychology degree, but the inherent amount of the field of reach and leverage you will be able to do is r
elatively small, because of the functions that have been in place for decades. The availability of resources that are both demographically available and recovery-oriented are small. The TRUE recovery-oriented resources. Which is a whole other conversation. My end goal is to reach those not only that are just entering the system for help, or have been there for awhile with no avail in succinct help, but to reach those that are young, old, in-between, minorities, lgbtq+, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, muslim, etc EVERYBODY that ISN‚ÄôT getting the resources that they need to reach and get their demographic, economic, social, etc need met, and quickly.

They give you three chances to pass it and I don‚Äôt think I passed it until my second try. My dad picked out my first car. It cost about $400. The very first time I drove it I was by myself and I was in my own neighborhood and I got pulled over by a woman cop. That was notable for two reasons. First off, this was the 1970‚Äôs and women cops were not as common as they are now. Also, the reason she stopped me was because I didn‚Äôt come to a complete stop at a stop sign. But I learned later that not stopping completely at stop signs was so common that drivers had a name for it. They called it a ‚ÄúCalifornia Roll‚Äù; you just kind of slow down and keep rolling right through it. And by the way, she let me go with just a warning. I drove for two years until I got diagnosed at age 19. I entered my first group home then and the counselors actually used to let 
me drive their cars. it seemed weird then and it seems weird now, I was pretty psychotic at the time but apparently I came off as so normal looking and acting that no one could tell I had schizophrenia let alone a mental illness.

175894336,It might end badly. It‚Äôs typical to feel better after stopping your meds. Most people seem to say that. It just seems like a gamble‚Äîwhere the odds are against you. I wouldn‚Äôt put too much stock in dreams. People who say they have prophetic or profound dreams seem to be ‚Äúpicking and choosing‚Äù Sure you might have some dream that is vivid and seems to really mean something when you wake up the next morning. But what about the million other dreams you‚Äôve had where you‚Äôre riding a bike through the ocean or flying off cliffs? Even after thousands of years of human existence there is still not really a definitive explanation of what dreams are and how they work. Just be careful about going off meds and think it through.
175894337,"Change to oral meds Yes No 0 voters I am pretty compliant with my meds. Very much so in fact. That said like many of us I have tried reducing meds, on my own, in attempts to reduce side effects But I have been very compliant these last three years. I get depixol depot every 3 weeks. I ended up on the depot because originally I was only on that med and liked the idea of just one injection once a month. It was more convenient. But now it is anything but convenient. I have to go to the depot clinic - 30 miles and 2 buses away (they stopped running the clinic in my town). In these days of covid I don‚Äôt like the idea of bus journeys. My dad said he would drive me but I don‚Äôt like exposing him. The pills of my depot med are very cheap and are taken twice a day. I currently take other meds twice a day anyway. It would be so much easier to just take oral meds I have never abused meds or used them in overdoses. They trust me with other psych meds, including APs and anxiety meds. So watcha think? Should 
I change from a depot to oral meds?"

175894342,"Hi _PERSON_, I do remember the mother/sister situation very well. Once again, just remember you are limited on what you can or cannot do at this point. I'm amazed your sister reached out & let everyone know about the dementia issue. Regardless, go visit your mom when you can. Spend those weekends with her one on one. You will have to bite your tongue when it comes to your sister, be very careful when speaking to her about anything. You have already learned she will turn on you in a second. The last thing you want is her stopping all contact with your mom. You sure don't need to discuss the same with your mom, she still has that allegiance to your sister. It's going to be one of the hardest things you will ever have to do. Instead of buying food that needs to be prepared for your mom once you leave, buy only what you will cook while there. There is no point wasting your money. You may want to consider buying her some healthy snacks that she eat with no cooking involved. Due to HIPPA laws the dr or s
taff legally cannot discuss your mother with you. I am sure your sister is the only one listed on the form that has access to get information. By having the weekly visiting nurse that is in your favor. While the house may be dirty, dishes piled up in the sink, the nurse will make notes in her file. When the nurse see's actual physical neglect of your mother this is when action will be taken. My husband has had in home wound care many times & the stories we were told by them was something else. They are use to seeing dirty homes, but they document it. Nothing happens until they see physical neglect of the patient. At any time you see actual rapid physical decline of your mom, just remember each state has a hotline number for ""elderly abuse"" & they act on complaints. There are several agencies that can help too. As for the nieces doing most of the cooking that's ok. They are at the age they do need to learn to cook. I think the overall situation has you just stressed to the max. If all of this wasn't going on
, most likely you would be fine with those girls having the ability to cook. By the way, both of my kids were taught to cook & actually liked learning. My 14 yr old grandson has also been taught to cook. He loves to cook meals that he has mastered & is quite proud of himself. In all honesty, caring for someone with dementia is extremely difficult because they cannot be left alone. You can't work a job & care for your mom, that would be too dangerous. As the dementia progresses, there will come a time that she most likely will need to be placed in a facility. Sad, but true, they require 24/7 care & monitoring. Please cut yourself some slack, you are doing the best you can. You already have a full plate dealing with your own circumstances. I am waiting for the day to read a post from you saying I have moved out & feeling so much better! When you need to vent, come here & get things off your chest."

175894367,"Probably everyone knows this already. If you have a large credit card debt like $7000 for example, and you‚Äôre paying 15% interest each month you will end up paying hundreds of dollars in interest by the time you pay it off. Especially if you‚Äôre only making the minimum payment each month. I‚Äôve been there. One solution is to find another credit card that charge 0% interest for a period of time and transfer the balance to this new card. You can find credit cards that charge 0% interest for up to 18 months And actually you can find new credit cards that charge 0% interest on balance transfers and 0% interest on purchases. This will save you a lot of money in the long run. But if you transfer a balance to another card be prepared to pay a 3%-5% fee for the transfer. That‚Äôs 3%-5% of the balance you transfer most credit card .companies charge this fee, but not all of them."

So in order to reach 2 SDs you need to start being sick at the age of 20 and then your IQ should be measured at the age of 80. Didn‚Äôt like this paper.

Although I am choosing to look at the white hairs I am getting from the stress as badges of honor. It is rough trying to make ends meet. I can't get food stamps because I make literally five dollars too much. I have lost about fifty pounds since March of last year. But now my fiance has to go help my mom to make a couple extra dollars for food and gas and she just doesn't understand how broke we are. I feel like all the work I am doing is pointless because as soon as I get my paycheck, within four hours I am completely broke. I have to ask friends for help all the time and I is taking its toll on me. I hate asking for help because I don't want people to think I am a user. I feel like I am wasting away trying to survive. Unfortunately it took almost two years for me to find a job, and my fiance e is facing the same problem with 
trying to find work. He is stressed from having to deal with my mom putting him down and making him feel like less of a person. I feel like I am getting ptsd dealing with her."

175894526,"I thought I would come on and leave an update while I was lurking about on a night where I am having a copious amount of palpitations. The problem I have keeping everyone updated is that I get on here when I am stressed, but then when I relax I tend to put help websites out of my head. The 30 day monitor was successful, and the doctor said she saw nothing that concerned her. Everything was normal except PVCs/ectopic heartbeats that she wasn't concerned about at all. Said they posed no harm to me whatsoever. I calmed down significantly in the last couple of months, and only had a handful here or there that I could easily knock down by ignoring them. This weekend however, they came roaring back. Had a moment on Thursday or Friday where I didn't eat anything from lunch time until about 7pm, and also got in a 30 minute walk on the treadmill. By the time I got done, my blood sugar felt like it had dropped, and I started having a significant amount of PVCs. I got settled down, but since then I have had a 
multitude of them. Today is probably the worst day I have had with them since the episode with the beta blockers. I wasn't having any this morning, but about 4pm they started in, and I have been having several an hour for the last 10 or so hours. And in my head I know it's because I am focusing on them that is causing them to happen more and more. When I watch TV or talk to my friends they subside. Then I can feel one and away we go again. It's just the sheer number of them bothering me. Two different heart doctors in the last four years and my primary care doctor have all said I am fine, but it's so hard to believe that when you are like ""OK so that's about 15-20 I've had this hour..."" And in reality, I know I probably have them all the time just like this and never feel them, but when I do feel them... etc etc. So anyway, just realized tonight I hadn't updated everyone and that was rude of me. So in October, I was given a clean bill of cardiac health, and yet I still can't shake this stupid anxiety when I 
have a flare up. *le sigh*"

174327829,"I came across an article once that cited posts from this forum as source material. Can‚Äôt recall which article though, I think it was on thought insertion but I‚Äôm not entirely sure. After getting it, I started studying schizophrenia as a student too and plan to pursue more academic work on the topic in the future. Certainly not a psychiatrist though, and my interests do not really need extra data nor the testing of hypotheses so the forums are not such a source for me. Our personal experiences in terms of symptoms are well-documented so there is no need to gather much more data on that I think - although to be fair, when reading the literature on thought insertion one does get confronted with the same handful of first person reports of it. Perhaps that‚Äôs why the article I mentioned took recourse to this forum. As for causal theories about how schizophrenia develops I think the forum is of little use as well. Side-effects are already studied in the tests before medication comes on the market. A
ll in all I think for most researchers there are better ways to study what they are interested in. One can take of course the forum itself as some sort of social phenomenon in the context of patient movements or something like that."

175894549,Ok so I will take 4x 600mg EPA and 300mg DHA fish oil pills for a total of 3.6g of omega 3 per day. We should be taking 2-6g per day. The expensive triple strength ones are maybe more expensive because you can take less pills to achieve the same dose - So maybe I'll buy cheaper ones and swallow many fish oil pills idk.. - More research needed.. I will look at research papers and talk to experts from reddit..
175894550,"Don‚Äôt really know, just remember trying all diferent kinds of meds and each had horrible side-effects because the doses were so high. I was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous at the time SZ knocked me flat. AA members kept showing up and visiting and taking me to the meetings they could and encouraging me to work the Steps. It was because of AA that I decided I was going to fight back hard. That was my turning point. Eventually applying the program to my SZ started to help as well. Some of the problems come from the illness. Some of the problems are a result of how the illness warps you personally. Those can be fixed and resolving them can give you back some function."

175894552,"Hello _PERSON_, I'm sorry your having a tough time. I am not a therapist or professional but enjoying sharing and giving support on this platform. After reading your post I feel like your difficulty with self-love and acceptance of love may stem from your past??? In my case it was child abuse. I never ever thought some of my problems stemmed from that until I went to counselling. She said I have PTSD. Literally, I had no clue. Once I came clean with my therapist, we worked on how to deal with the stuff from the past. She told me to put in in a ""make believe box"". Yes its still there, but locked up in a box. I then was able to learn new skills and seriously look at myself in the mirror, Overall, I'm a good person and believe you are the same!!!!!!!! Give yourself a nice break from all the stress and expectations society brings to the table. We are all free to choose our own paths!!!!!!!!!! No matter what we do, we will be judged by someone else. My favorite saying is, no one is going to rent any m
ore space in my head!! Take a deep breath my friend and look into the mirror and say to yourself, I am beautiful, smart and I love myself. Do that everyday and before you know it, you will believe it because it's true!! My feeling that in order to except love, one must love them self first!! I'm no expert, just sharing what I have learned through years of counseling. Take it one day at a time!! I'll be praying for you :)) _USER_ID_"

In contrast to other neurotransmitter transporters, which are bound by their inhibitors from the outer side of the cell membrane, GlyT1 is bound by its inhibitor from the inner side. ‚ÄúThe structure was a surprise for us. It seems that the GlyT1 inhibitor must first cross the cell membranes before it can access GlyT1 from the inside of the neurons,‚Äù says _NAME_, a senior author in the study. ‚ÄúThis structure provides a blueprint for developing new inhibitors of GlyT1, be they organic molecules or antibodies,‚Äù explains _NAME_. ‚ÄúThe sybody developed for this study binds GlyT1 at a previously unknown binding site and locks it in a state in which it cannot transport glycine any more.

174327871,Some people experience hypersexuality and gambling disorders on abilify. I‚Äôm on it and everything is ok. Mostly.
175894671,"Heya dude, sorry your having a rough night. Do you guys have any pets? Normally some tea, a loved one, and funny distractions work for me. You‚Äôre crushing your classes, working hard and well. You‚Äôre a great parent. And you‚Äôre worth it. You‚Äôre making things better than they were. Sending you some good vibes, stay safe"
175894672,Hello everyone So the past week or so I have been getting quite tired in the afternoons. For instance I took a 3 hour nap from 1:30-4:30. I felt so groggy and loopy waking up. I am starting to think the sheer boredom of the lockdown plus some mild depression is the root cause. Hopefully it isn‚Äôt anything physical. I have already to postpone my annual exam because of COVID and will likely have to again reschedule it because it is getting worse here My sleeping patterns need improvement too. Forgot to add that I am 29 years oldPost Edited (TMo) : 7/30/2020 1:46:47 PM (GMT-6)
175894673,Walk my brothers dogs. Wash my hair and shower. Write Christmas cards.
175894674,TBI is a risk factor for sz.
175894675,I know but it wasnt worth how ill it was making me I was having really bad side affects from them so I stopped them 2 days ago
174327864,"From that article you just linked to, it says What are the risks of taking DMAE? DMAE shouldn‚Äôt be taken by people with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or epilepsy. Talk to your doctor if you have these or similar conditions before taking DMAE."
175894676,"I don‚Äôt know why this is. The pattern is usually formed by the trauma of the weekend, and it eats into the first part of the working week until I start to feel better again. Then it just goes in cycles every week and it never seems to end. It‚Äôs just I am trying to see things more positively with work etc, but I struggle to remember these things when I get overwhelmed and fall into a dark placer with my thoughts. :-/"
175894677,Yes I have sz and then PTSD from my time in the military.
175894678,Like is it possible to get over that? I never used to be like this. I only developed this type of phobic anxiety in the past year
175894679,"I can relate to your problem. I am myself highly deluded when it comes to my phone. I think somebody is monitoring me. I am practically anxious when I watch porn. I sometimes think the world is going to end when I‚Äôm jerking off to porn. Which is a bit funny when I think, about it."
175894680,"_AT_MENTION_ is that your real name? If so, we recommend changing it because this forum is publicly searchable on googke, etc."

175894687,I hate getting fogged out on a mystery but it relieves the pain of known realities.
175894688,I figure out why it posted in such an irritating format. How do I repost this so it‚Äôs easier to read?
175894689,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes i pay rent, 450 a month. I‚Äôve been paying rent here for years. I never miss it. It‚Äôs not enough though, he wants me to work. I get money from the government (welfare, not disability)"
175894690,Same here ‚Ä¶
175894691,"By ignoring them and keeping myself occupied with anything but. The more you think about the voices, the more you‚Äôre in the habit of paying attention to them and the more they control you. You know what I do when I‚Äôm having a crappy evening with voices chewing on me? I put on some high energy music and bop to it. Feck the voices. Distraction is the main attraction."
175894692,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_, for sharing your experiences and feelings and insight. Your work takes me back to memories of my mother‚Äôs stories of how she struggled in a sanitorium as she was being crippled by muscular tuberculosis when she was a child. Thankfully she gave birth to me many years later and I have life to live today. I encourage you to keep telling your story by writing. Consider this. Every bit of insight you develop into yourself peels back another protective layer surrounding your soul in a healing process of self discovery. At least that‚Äôs how insight development seems to work for me and I think it will do the same for you. Write."
175894693,This is 100% untrue. The site doesn‚Äôt display your email to anyone except for you. Not even the mods can see it.
175894694,"According to google that contains risperidone which helps some people with that kind of thing. You could try a different med, not all the meds work for all people."
175894695,"Just watched the YouTube video, did not think much of it, like student filmmakers trying to produce horror films.

This for me is a general description, there are no hands coming out of boxes or _NAME_ White voices."
175894696,"Sometimes. People around are crazy and try to cause problems, lying all the time. The problem is, I‚Äôm not as crazy as the people who lie all the time."
175894697,All we had to do here in San _NAME_ is complete a two week course of eight hours a day about what we do as pss. And one has to take WRAP. Looks like we‚Äôll have to be certified too once the law is passed. But that‚Äôs a good thing. Just have to pass a test and then you can become a pass. You might want to pursue it!
175894698,i take benzos as well.i have a very good doctor.im lucky because not a lot of doctoctors prescribe benzos.
175894699,"Well if this turns fruitful, then this is good for your portfolio."
175894700,"Today is awesome so far. Picked up my sister's guitar from my dads. She doesnt want me to have it just in case her son wants to play some day. I'm just gonna re-string it and clean it up a bit. I don't have the money for a new guitar so she said she will let me keep it until her son is older. He's only 3 right now. And I got like 30 books from my dads house, from my personal bookshelf to read. All philosophy! I cant wait to dig in. And _PERSON_ sent me a bunch of supplies to paint. So today is great and I barely spent any money. Just bought some beer to relax. But _NAME_ need to fill up my car soon before the job interview later this week."
175894701,"I think it is incredibly common to feel anger, shame, hatred, distrust after longterm abuse. You dont need to totally suppress all anger and pretend all is happy and good. That doesnt help anyone. You arent bad for feeling this. You arent bad at all and you definitely deserve love. Clinging tight to anger/hatred/self-hatred as a permanent protective shield, doesnt prevent, but only continues abuse though. For myself, it feels as if i swallowed the emotions of the abusers and it continued to harm. You can heal. I think seeking out all sorts of loving activities can help, even if it doesnt feel that way yet. For me things like prayer, reading, connecting to kind people, taking good care of my body, nature, etc. Seeking out a select few of the most gentle and safe people to carefully connect to again. Also though: ‚Äúhearing‚Äù my anger and seeing if there is an action i should take‚Ä¶distance myself from someone, express a boundary, protect myself. Im struggling with this too, so im not really sure i
f im a good advisor."
175894702,I crochet‚Ä¶ Ever so often I‚Äôll pick up my embroidery‚Ä¶ I seem to be good at both but I enjoy crochet a bit better‚Ä¶ Something about creating something from yarn is amazing and makes me feel good
175894703,Sounds like it could be a good thing.
175894704,Ok I guess that‚Äôs not all that long. I hope things improve with time. Sorry you‚Äôre having an ultra bad day.
175894705,could be a side effect of the antipsychotic you on especially the overeating. Welcome to the forum
175894706,"The best advice I ever got was this: ‚ÄúYou know that uncomfortable and nervous feeling you have, and how you‚Äôre so worried about embarrassing yourself? Everyone feels that way. They‚Äôre spending like 80% of every conversation just worrying about saying something dumb. If you embarrass yourself but then just laugh it off, you‚Äôll make everyone feel more at ease, because if you survived, they can too.‚Äù"
175894707,A case manager at an ER and she wasn‚Äôt much help at all. I went to a Psychatric Center the next day for an assessment and they said I didn‚Äôt qualify for inpatient. I was just given information for crisis lines.
175894708,"I have Nozinan 50mg (Levomepromazine) as a PRN, but if I take that now it will ruin my day, plus after waking up I feel horrible for about an hour or so The doctor approves, but we disagree on 25% reduction, he suggested to do 5-10%, but that is too slow for me."
175894709,You write so well you should post more often
175894710,"Right on, congratulations!!"
175894711,Yes I do with complete confidence
175894712,"Just remember, the meds may not work as well if you stop them and get psychotic again. Then you be stressed all the times with delusions, and hallucinations"
175894713,"Ha now everybody is isolated and a shut in, not just some of us sz or other regular shut ins."
175894714,What tea do you drink _AT_MENTION_ ? I drink Yorkshire tea Just a blend but I love it
175894715,"I‚Äôm in some groups that allow anonymous posts, and I was thinking maybe it could be discussed whether it could be a feature here. If it can‚Äôt be implemented in the forum code, maybe members who wished to stay anonymous could message mods who then posted on their behalf? I definitely have some things I‚Äôd like to ask the forum without it being traceable"
175894716,Not sure. But I wouldn't recommend cuz you can't take it every day.
175894717,It‚Äôs not an exact science and there is some difference in not only the person diagnosing but also in the symptoms as you present them. It is what it is. Do you deserve it ‚Ä¶yeah for sure. Is it practical and legal in the modern world. No unless you can prove incompetence. That is the legal world.
175894718,I‚Äôm caffeinated now so I feel better I just wish I could feel good naturally lol but I need meds and coffee. God or nature made me flawed. Idk. Normies are scary to me (neurotypicals). They seem so jagged
175894719,Ppl used to steal them when I was working in a supermarket. Now they have magnets that block the wheels when driven too far.
175894720,It‚Äôs common that diagnosis changes over time. Meds and the progress of the disorder itself make a difference and I‚Äôve found that certain trends are local as well amongst the psydocs themselves. Important thing is to take the meds as prescribed and try utmost for best function. Don‚Äôt get bogged down in the semantics of it all.
174327862,"I'm interested to see if other people experience the same things as me. For me there are different kinds of voices: 1. Random bits of conversations. It's as if I'm tuning into some collective unconscious and hearing people's conversations, but it keeps switching to different people so I only hear, say, two thirds of a sentence or so. They're not voices I've heard before or people I know. These were so common in the background I mostly ignore them to the point where I hardly notice it anymore. They have a spatial direction and a distance, but not in this world. They seem to occur in a plane that overlays this one - I know that makes no sense, but there is a different kind of spatial quality to them than when I hear things with my ears. I've never been afraid of these voices. 2. Voices in the real world. These are indistinguishable from people speaking to me. They are less frequent. They are frustrating, because I end up looking everywhere for a source that doesn't exist, and sometimes scary because 
I know what I heard, and if there is nothing there either I'm going crazy or things like ghosts/spirits/etc are real. 3. The voice of God. I don't even believe in God, but there is a voice I defy anyone to experience and not believe it is the voice of God. It seems to emanate from every point of the universe, inside me and outside, all at once and with such clarity and power there's nothing else in existence you've ever felt that was more real. Whatever it says to me is impossibly hard to remember though, like trying to recall a dream. This one is the rarest one I experience. 4. Amnesia voices. Like the God voice, there are some I hear that I just cannot remember even straight afterwards. I know it happened, and that something was said, but I can never recall what. I sometimes get freaked out because I do remember saying 'yes' (and the like) at the end and I get worried I just agreed to something I shouldn't have. 5. Sculpture voices. These are when the sounds are actually there(I think?), but masked by other 
sounds that my mind kind of chisels away. To give an example: I was in a mental hospital with a fountain outside. I could hear screaming all night every night. When I asked a nurse if she could hear it she said no. So I asked some other people the next day. No one could hear it, but to me it was plain as day. Next night I tried really hard to figure out what was wrong, and I think the sounds were actually there, within the fountain noise, and my mind was dismissing all the other noise and selectively attuning to just some of it like when a sculptor removes rock to reveal sculpture. I was highly stressed/manic at the time and figure my pattern recognition might have been turned right up. None of the different voices say nasty things to me, so I don't really have a terrible experience with them, but it's still scary sometimes because I feel like there's a terrifying insanity stalking me, and hearing voices is a reminder I might not be as in control as I think. If I clear my thoughts entirely so there is absolut
ely nothing going on in my head voices will sometimes start to wander in. I'm not the author of these voices, and yet I don't consider them to be 'voices' in the schizophrenic sense. I think most people actually self-identity with these voices and consider them to have been their own thoughts. For me I consider them to be arising in my mental backyard (so to speak), but not created by me. Sometimes I can't help but wonder if they are the voices of Gods, but mostly I accept they are generated by my subconscious. These I hold distinct from the 5 categories above. I have this hypothesis though that if the thoughts were nasty to me it would all be different. If they were nasty it would cause me emotional pain. Since himans are highly motivated to avoid pain I would then withdraw myself from the source of pain in the same way we withdraw our hand from a flame. But since the voices are arising in my own mental backyard, and I have no control over their comings and goings, the only way I can withdraw from them is to 
withdraw from my mental backyard. So every time I hear a nasty voice I recoil a little further from the pain, and create a little more distance between myself and the mental backyard where the voices emerge. After a while not only are the voices completely alien to me, but they are not even emerging I to any part of me that I identify with because I've pushed that part away. All of a sudden the voices are exterior in every way. I think this is why schizophrenics so often hear negative voices - it takes negative voices to cause that final schism. I think in normal conversation the mental arena into which these voices emerge would be used as a well spring for generating words for speaking to others. When you push that spring away you risk losing some of your capacity to communicate,and it is often noted that schizophrenics speak less and often have some difficulty describing things. I'm interested to hear about other people's experiences with voices if you would be so kind."

I used to think it had to do with how much food I had throughout the day, but even times where I ate extra meals I think it still happened.

175894799,"ocd is due to brain damage, its due to lack of continuous activation of prefrontal cortex. taking medication will not solve it instead we need to redirect our focus away from the needless thoughts and that is the basis of ERP or Exposure Response Prevention therapy for ocd. medications like SSRI only target the anxiety part which is not a solution as it can numb other thoughts too which causes memory issues and others. exercising the mind by solving puzzles will help to activate pfc which in turn can reduce ocd behavior."

175894803,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
175894804,a very private question but I have to ask‚Ä¶ when you got into hospital (psy) was it because they forced you to go? or you have decided to go on your own? and when you go by yourself. what needs to happen for you to decide to go there?
175894805,"Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do things on said list. I have such a list. I forced myself to use four coping strategies today: walking outside, exercise, driving, and listening to comedy. Some days it doesn't make me feel amazing (I hardly ever feel amazing these days) but at least it keeps me above water."

175894810,"I guess the psychs won‚Äôt tell you that on taking aps you have to live the rest of your life on a diet due to non compliance, but it is the truth. It is possible to lose some of the weight when you are of a higher weight to start with. I was 85kg a few years ago, now I am 76kg. I lost 5kg quite quickly through rigorous exercise in a month of hard work. the rest was much harder to lose. When you don‚Äôt see the scales move and you work so hard to lose it, motivation is kicked in the balls. I am only 5ft 6 so 85kg was quite big to me, hard exercise on an exercise bike took the first 5kg off really quickly."

I was very ill, and this treatment did nothing to help as I was completely gone. Got released the day before my 18th birthday on appeal, I was there for a month. Within weeks I was in a community hospital and I ended up on Olanzapine for two years. I have been back on AP‚Äôs now full time for 7 years"
175894812,"People often don‚Äôt know what to say to people like us. They dread hearing bad news of us going back into psychosis. My mom used to tell me I couldn‚Äôt go to church or hang out with the youth group. She was uncomfortable with my religious beliefs as they differ from hers. I was emancipated at 16, but ended up maintaining a relationship with my mom. But I have to keep conversation on the positive side or she‚Äôll lose interest. I don‚Äôt know why your mom doesn‚Äôt talk to you much. It may be she feels bad about herself and it may not be about you at all. When you see your mom, try to remain positive. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs your fault, but people like to be around positive thinkers. So try to remain positive around your mom. Just remember you did nothing wrong. You can‚Äôt help being sick"

175894841,"In the introductions thread, Oblivion kindly responded to my post where I was complaining about the struggle to find time alone. Oblivion said: This is my own experience exactly. When I'm spending a lot of time around other people, even my ""free time"" is not very productive at producing work or relaxation. When I'm properly isolated for a while, my brain starts working, I stop procrastinating, and I can get a lot done. Oblivion also said: And although I do feel like this sometimes, I don't think I should agree. Living and interacting with other people always involves compromises. I've made choices that create obligations to other people, and asking to be allowed to behave exactly as I would like to behave would be selfish and unfair. It would also, I think, be counter-productive in the long run. In my case, and if I understand correctly I think this is a common experience for SPD, I do want to be connected to other people. The people I want to be connected to live within a world filled with even 
more people. Whilst I would love to just interact with the people that I want to interact with, in the ways that I want to interact, that isn't something that they would accept. My wife, for example, considers that part of my relationship with her means that I am obligated to interact with her family. So what I'd really like to do is to get better at creating time alone, given that it has to be negotiated, it can't just be claimed. I don't want to be a jerk to other people, I just want to avoid them as much as possible. So, a few open questions that people might be interested and/or willing to engage with: 1) What counts as being alone? For me, I've always found it hard to feel alone unless I'm completely alone in my own house, and I know that no one else is going to show up. Having a guarantee that no one will come at least until the next day feels super-alone. 2) Is it possible to increase feeling alone even when other people are nearby? I have my own study, but it's impossible to guarantee that my wife and 
kids won't want to come in and talk to me when I am in there. It definitely counts as partially alone, but might be possible to make it better. 3) Are there good strategies for negotiating more time alone - particularly from family?"

However, I am dealing with something a little more than just mania. After 22 years I have a description at least. It looks like paranoid personality disorder that comes in episodes that last for at least a month but usually 6-12 weeks with a few months of what seems to be remission. The thing is personality disorders don‚Äôt remit and I‚Äôd never be able to reflect back on my behavior and see that it was abnormal. When its going on I have no insight of course. Lithium seems to attenuate these episodes a bit but doesn‚Äôt get rid of them. Antipsychotics do get rid of them but I hate the negs, it makes me feel overmedicated. Then I question if I‚Äôm just making symptoms up. Again, if its schiz anything that I have it has to be the mildest case of it ever noted. I function pretty well on most days and on oth
ers I do a good job of faking it. I have had a few cases of negative symptoms that weren‚Äôt caused by meds, I always referred to them as depression without feeling sad."

175894931,"Hi, I'm _PERSON_ and I'm new to this page. I'm 19 and for the last 4 years of my life I have been struggling with things I have yet to have diagnosed because I'm too scared to know the answers. Mostly everyday I have felt like a let down to my family. Being the middle child who's older sister has a good career a husband and child and who's youngest sister has a life plan and a boyfriend, I just feel like I have done nothing with my life except disappoint people. To make matters worse I came out as lesbian to my family, my dad said he had to accept it because I'm his daughter even though he is homophobic. And even though my older sister said she accepts me she still hints at me getting married to a man. As the years have progressed the feeling have gotten worse, I struggle to sleep because I can't stop thinking about things, when I do sleep I sleep until the afternoon. In the past I have kept things to myself and never told anyone, my family still ditn know and only one friend knows and I met her on
line so we've never met face to face. I just feel like I'm putting all of unnecessary stress and pointless worries on others so I stopped saying anything to everyone. I pushed people away I lost friends. I was hesitant to put this up too. For a while it got really bad, I started thinking what my family would react like if I was gone, I started thinking how I would do it, what I would write in my notes for them. I began to self harm a lot, I hated how I looked to the point I got rid of my mirror in my room and refused to look in any others. I despised myself so much I began to starve myself just wanting to be thinner and prettier. Everytime I ate I hurt myself just a little like a punishment. One time I hurt myself worse than the others but I just covered it up and I regret it so much looking back on it. My parents and family still don't know because I never where short sleeves, my sister saw it one but I denied it and then broke down alone in my room. For a while I felt like I was getting better my thoughts a
bout myself got more positive and I began accepting who I was and started lessening the internal homophobia that I was carrying around. But then almost like nothing changed I fell back into it again. The temptation of harming myself whenever I got upset, had an argument with someone or just felt pointless started growing. I hate myself and with every negative homophobic comment my dad makes just causes more of an issue. I'm slowly giving up again, I feel overwhelmed, anxious and panicked all the time, I hate where I work because I feel so overwhelmed all the time but there's nowhere else close by to work and I just feel like I'm going to be stuck doing the same job for the rest of my life because I don't have talents like my siblings. I don't have a life like them, I don't have hobbies. I can't see myself with a life int he future, I can't see myself with someone with a house and kids and a job that doesn't scare me. I just feel alone and lost with no guidance at all and I'm ready to give up I don't want it a
nymore I just want to close my eyes and not wake up but there's one thing that stops me from doing it all and just saying fuck it and that's the one friend I had who I could tell it all to. Although we never met she means a lot to me. I couldn't do that to her not when she has a lot of struggles to. If I could get diagnosed with just something so I can finally get help it might give me a bit of hope that I can do soemthing for once, maybe I could get a bit better and see the positive things. Or maybe nothing will change and I'll say goodbye but I just want help I need help I don't want to be alone anymore."

175894947,"The main hospital in my area which they are in the process of selling off, next to the Mosque belonging to my Sheikh and surrounded by people of the same ancestry as my father, seems to have been taken over by militants from another continent. It is quite scary. In the past I have romanticised revolution but never colonialization, but karma, if you believe in that, has a habit of going in cycles, and progressing to greater and greater heights. I am scared to go there on my own, even though I trust the process, there is no one with my interests at heart, and no one who can relate to my mixed cultural background, I am certainly not black, except in heart and soul, but then neither are the militants, they come from a world which was traumatised by similar events to my ancestors, the trouble is they don‚Äôt recognise it.

First off, yes I would certainly agree it is quite the inflamitory and sensitive concept but I feel the need to unmix things up for those who might be visiting this site or reading my post for nefarious reasons. My intrusive thoughts are not vivid but opaque prompted versions of solely the words (not imagery or images of scenes or the like) such as ‚Äúrape‚Äù or ‚Äúsex‚Äù thought through or sometimes through self-corrected blips in my stream of conciousness in most cases devoid of emotion or maybe with just a quick reflex of realization that it was a quick intrusive tick. As far as kids go I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm quite so nervous around them or intimidated by their feelings as I am I guess it‚Äôs bc I don‚Äôt know any kids 
or know anything about the way they think or what interests them. Not necessarily interested in caring to find out either but I can‚Äôt seem to figure out why, even considering that there are those severely confused and corrupted enough to engage in inappropriate relations with children,that acting like some holy worshiping protector and task force for these kind of people seems to be some peoples‚Äô favorite front. Maybe its a political/racial issue that truley bears the most proportionate amount of reason for the gung-ho death to pedo‚Äôs mindset some people have. I am not by any means saying the deep dark reality of the fact that there are sick people out there who actually do sick things is an alright thing but for those that would judge me for what I encounter within my OCD symptoms and thought broadcasting i weep to my very core at your cold close minded nature and way of upbringing but I choose my awareness of my idiosyncrasies and sense of self worth and strength over your ignorance."

Basically there is no Facebook group about stalking you, at least not that I‚Äôm aware of, and most likely there isn‚Äôt. Why would people want to stalk you? Is it a social experiment? Are you a celebrity? No. That‚Äôs the short answer. But I know it‚Äôs hard to believe when one is in the thick of psychosis. It‚Äôs pretty classic stuff. I had some tech based delusions early on.

175895011,"I was 13 when I started hallucinating demons, etc. and having religion-based delusions. I was fully immersed and able to function on some level because I was involved in one extreme church after another. I underwent an exorcism because I believed I was demon possessed, and the church elders believed it too. So I thought it was all real until my son was eighteen and began telling me about his hallucinations‚Ä¶ it made me realize that my experiences might not be real. I sought help and was diagnosed only six or so years ago. I have insight, and I‚Äôve come to understand what‚Äôs actually going on, but it‚Äôs difficult to let go of some parts because they‚Äôre very real to me."

Also, I hope none of them will give me a bad mark because I sent them messages while the democratic debate was going on here in Michigan. I'll listen to the entire thing on a podcast at work.

Please get to a pdoc that‚Äôs not afraid of increasing meds. Not wanting to put people on it is a bullsshit excuse.fair enough if you have side effects serious but if your fine I think I‚Äôd go straight to 6mg.The med changed my life"

I used to dream of going swimming when I had it to get rid of the electricity, as I called it. Last night I forgot to raise the foot of the bed, which sometimes relieves it. The only two things that help me are some benzos and opioids. The np at the clinic a few years ago asked me if I wanted a fentanyl patch lol. I wish I'd said yes! She was replaced by the one who forced me to cold turkey in 2013. Have you found anything that seems to help? Another thing that helps me is to eat a hard-boiled egg before I go to sleep."

175895103,"So someone whose been subjected to these ‚Äúexorcisms‚Äù won‚Äôt feel comfortable opening up about it on this forum. Likewise, someone who believes in God won‚Äôt feel comfortable saying love and light, or I‚Äôll pray for you. But we do say these things. Because not everyone is an atheist. Diversity is a good thing for communities. I am pretty spiritual. I feel boxed in when I can‚Äôt express how I feel. And honestly it makes things worse, because much of my experiences could be discerned from ‚ÄúSchizophrenia‚Äù and are actual spiritual experiences, but that becomes ‚Äútaboo‚Äù or paranormal. SO I just have less and less that I can freely express or understand, making me feel much more marginalized. I really don‚Äôt fit the norms, so it would be nice if there were more places for people to freely express themselves without being censored. Honestly? If you stopped censoring this forum completely it would probably be a thousand times better. And also you could update it or do something to make it mo
re enjoyable. Like, I watched that video on your main page and it was great and all but completely depressing and not an accurate depiction of what masses of people who have this ONE LABEL experience on various spectrums of the disease, some people even think of mania as a sort of gift, and some people recover from schizophrenia without medications. But this forum has always reflected a very weak narrow-minded and bleak perspective. There are extremes, but some people can recover, IMO and BIGPHARMA works hard to push the narrative that this is a death sentence so stop trying to spin it like its not what you‚Äôre trying to push."
175895104,"it depends but you can do one thing in the mean time that is to create habits and schedules. For example create a habit to brush teeth daily at least once. Bath one time at least once in every 2 days, go to bed at fixed time at night and wake at fixed time on morning using alarm clock. Try to limit nap during daytime to less than 30 minutes. Exercise or workout at least once a week. This way emulate a normal person daily routine. This then becomes a habit which you can follow as a rule even if negative symptoms come back."

No one eats that much! It helps me with my eye twitches, since twitching is usually caused by an electrolyte deficiency. Also helps some with my arthritis, since it replenishes my alkaline buffer, so the body can better flush out the uric and oxalic acids in my joints that cause the pain and stiffness. Also, about the high Calcium diet, too much Calcium causes depression and increased risk of heart attack (Calcium plaques are the main cause of that), and is something that should be generally avoided in excess."

175895139,I quit smoking for 8 days. I was having very little withdrawals the past 2 days. I had a disturbing dream about an ex girlfriend. 20 year ago she asked me a simple question. All I had to do is tell her I loved her. If I would have done so my entire life could have been different. Looking back in retrospect it was the most pivotal point in my life. I saw her in my dream last night. I laid there for hours hoping she‚Äôd come back. She didn‚Äôt break up with me I broke up with her. I wanted her back but she didn‚Äôt believe that I loved her. At the time drugs were more important to me. I ended up trying to destroy myself with drugs. All these years later and I‚Äôm still living with the consequences. Been thinking a lot about death lately. Maybe in the next life things will be different. I‚Äôve been smoking for 29 years. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion we all die. In the end we all wish we had more time so what difference does it make it I quit smoking. We all go sooner or later. I just wish I would have 
made different choices in life. I hurt a lot of people around me especially those that were the closest. I‚Äôve always tried to leave the past behind me and learn from my mistakes but the dream I had haunts me. I haven‚Äôt thought about me ex in a long time. I thought I had moved on. I dated a couple of women since. But that dream I had hit me hard. It made me realize what I lost.

Psychiatry is, to an extent, subjective and some people will be diagnosed with different disorders by different psychiatrists at different times. This is a very difficult area. As a psychiatrist you have to do the absolute best you can, and if you disagree with the previous psychiatrist, then you need to say so. It will have implications for both prognosis and treatment. But think what it‚Äôs like for the patient ‚Äì you have a diagnosis that you may or may not like, but you start to accept it. Then someone comes along and says, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù As a patient, a diagnosis can be vital in providing some kind of valida
tion, and it also gives a recognised way of communicating what is wrong to other people. This can be very necessary, both on a personal level and also for issues such as work and benefits. That has certainly been the case with me ."

Yes, COVID-19 tanked the DJIA to below 20,000 points but the stock market is returning to its pre-COVID-19 level. I believe that the Trump Administration is somehow permitting those ultra high net worth individuals of whom have amassed a gargantuan amount of capital to float the DJIA to a level that will assist _PERSON_ in his re-election bid. _PERSON_ is basing his re-election strategy on a bullish stock market. By the time the 2020 US Presidential Election comes around this November 3rd, who knows where the stock market will be.

However, they are now extensively utilized as off label in a myriad of diseases despite their frequently serious metabolic side-effects and hyperprolactinemia.The purpose of our study was to observe long-term (one year) prolactin level change in first episode schizophrenia patients treated with one of the four AAs: olanzapine, quetiapine, amisulpride, ziprasidone.This study is an analysis of the prolactin level associated with the atypical antipsychotics used in European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial (EUFEST) study.Seventy-three first episode schizophrenia patients from the 113 patients, randomized to one of the four AAs treatment arms. 
Prolactin level was obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 months for all the four AAs. Analyses have been done for each antipsychotic separately for each sex.For the male patients neither of the four antipsychotics have been associated with a statistically significant increase of prolactin level in the entire study (p>0.05). In case of the female patients, treatment with olanzapine (p=.021) and ziprasidone (p=.005) has been associated with a decrease of prolactin level in one year compared with baseline.In both men and women, the administration of these four AAs is not associated with the increase of prolactin levels, moreover, in women's case, there is a reduction of prolactin values at administration of Olanzapine and Ziprasidone. These results are optimistic, suggesting that long term administration of these antipsychotics is safe regarding prolactin level."

I found a toaster I liked a little better that was a few bucks cheaper. The Brita pitcher was about $6 cheaper, the filters were the same.

I meant stay at my house. I somehow conveyed that to him, no clue how The past few days ive been all over the place. I was told to go to one store and I went to another.

Its cost me the people I love and I just want to be better. I have a greenhouse, crafty room, goats, chickens, dogs, more then I can name of things to do and still i do them sad and depressed crying most times. I don't want to live my life like this no more.

I just kept taking 0.5mg of Xanax until I felt better because no one is there to reassure me that it even works or is real. I feel like I might have a panic attack now. My mom said she might bring me to the ER or doctor tomorrow. How is this my fault? It is. I'm drinking a coffee. Maybe it will help.

175895369,"Yeah I feel like I‚Äôve gotten a misdiagnosis too. Before I started my ap I never had delusions or heard voices, or saw things etc. The only things I did struggle with before being diagnosed and taking a ap were 1. Depression, 2. Anxiety 3. Anger (As a result of my abusive family). I feel very invalidated too by my pdoc and generally my whole family. If you you have an abusive controlling family I recommend you find ANY way to CUT ALL TIES with those people. People can be self centered and only have their own interests in mind. My father was never really there for me and was a horrible role model. My mother trys to micromanage my life. I have made tremendous progress in the past few years though by getting a disability income, my own apartment, and food stamps to support myself. It won‚Äôt be too long before I can cut my toxic family members out of my life for good. Being independent and having a car also helps and finding a supportive community of people you can trust outside of your family for su
pport and validation of your feelings. I wish I had all the answers for you but I‚Äôm still trying my best to find my own answers to my problems I have in life. I wish you the best of luck and may God Bless you."

175895394,"When I had my psychotic break I used to try to predict the future with my bible, I would open randomly and point at some random passage and believed I was communicating with God. Sometimes I would ask myself yes or no questions and if a bird flew across my window it meant yes. If it was raining, lightning also meant yes. I had this strange delusion that I could communicate with God and also read the skies (clouds and stars) to predict the future.

Either way, I'm doomed with psychosis forever maybe - Whether it be triggered by stress - _PERSON_ I'll always be stressed especially after my bad trip. The bad trip was a blessing and a complete curse - Like schizophrenia itself - If you put it in perspective that you have to live with it and deal with it, overcome it for the rest of your life and the effects are apart of who you are - Just like anything else.. You can deny it and not let it define you but everything defines everyone if you want to get really deep into the nature of reality. I have such trippy thoughts all day every day that Idk if I should even be posting here cuz you guys can get shared psychotic disorder from me - Then you think of the fact that you already have psychosis and also that everyone else knows what I know at

For example, a study published in 1982 reported that when a group of patients with schizophrenia were each given 20 mg of fluphenazine, the difference between the highest and lowest blood level of the drug was 40-fold. Thus, a very low dose of an antipsychotic is sufficient to control the symptoms of many patients with schizophrenia, even if it does not produce full recovery, whereas other patients may require much higher doses to achieve the same effect.

175895443,"I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs really tough watching someone you love go through that. When my dad‚Äôs cancer spread to his brain, it started affecting his speech and his personality."
175895444,"_AT_MENTION_ Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don‚Äôt get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Volunteer Moderator _AT_MENTION_"
175895445,"Thanks _PERSON_ If went fine. At the least the routine procedure did, anyway."
175895446,"I think so as it wasn‚Äôt a full headache, more like brain and eyes pressure/cramps."
175895447,"For one or two years I have not had the normal awakening feeling in the morning. I have to be forced to get up by something I schedule (and it is very hard), or else I don‚Äôt get up until after 12 hours of sleep. Secondly, in the evening if I don‚Äôt have much planned, I lay down and nap for two hours (about 7:00 to 9:00). I fight it some, but I just feel tired and all I want to do is lay down and nap. Now that this problem is coming into focus, I am starting to think this may be due to my AP: Zyprexa 15 mg. I am going to ask my new psychiatrist when I see him in a month. Or could this just be my sz and my aging? I don‚Äôt feel tired at work or when I have something interesting to do."
175895448,Stayed up all night playing Story of Seasons with my sister.
175895449,Lexapro is a lot better for anxiety. Effexor didn‚Äôt help me at all.

175895451,"Hi cln777, I take 5000iu of D3 a day. It is a high level and my blood work shows levels high. I feel good though at this level. And if I forget to take it I sure notice. I read that 4500 is enough and more can be toxic. Start out low and work your way up. It really can make a difference. Best wishes. I have the intrusive thoughts too. Come out of nowhere, but I try to push them aside. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175895452,"How could you help me, people?"
175895453,Well done you!!!
175895454,"Is english your first language? I ask because it seems like you‚Äôre having a tough time articulating what you‚Äôre trying to say. Sometimes that can be-because the dose you‚Äôre on makes thinking hard. I want you to be aware of this, because if its not absolutely necessary I would seek to lower your dose to a point where you can think clearly again. I understand enough to tell you that, for me, I naturally felt hungrier while on certain drugs, I think if you count calories you should be fine, but if you find you‚Äôre gaining weight start lowering your calories, until you can maintain your weight. If you feel very hungry at that reduced count, I would consider changing foods to be more plant based because they have fewer calories and more volume."
175895455,"It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre making me sick, when they‚Äôre around. Ever since I moved here, some dumb-_AT_MENTION_ tells people I‚Äôm a hooker. I was a medical technologist and lab scientist. They love insulting me."
175895456,"Having problems but doing ok at the moment. One of my main voices doesn't want me to talk about him, so I can't say what I wanted to say."

175895461,"I did worse when unmedicated, I threw knives at my brother and he did bleed from his forearm."
175895462,"I‚Äôm going to ask my therapist for resources on eating disorder recovery. I‚Äôve been doing most of the work on my own because I‚Äôve had to focus on other kinds of MI recovery when I see someone but I‚Äôd love a professional‚Äôs input on _NAME_ matters at this point. It just sucks that my _NAME_ voice will always be, at least subconsciously, informing my every decision about food. Eating disorders - not even once, lol."
175895463,Yes I smoke and my voices say that iam going to hell for it
175895464,Yes I have had a lot of poor judgement or inappropriate moments. But this time rather than blame it on the schizophrenia I‚Äôll blame me. Schizophrenia is part of what I am.
175895465,Do you have a hobby you almost never get the chance to work on? Now is your chance! Post about whatever creative hobby you want to work on here! I will be working on my guitar. My goal is to master barre chords by the time quarantine ends.

I‚Äôll never forget how terrified his dad sounded - he was crying - and he‚Äôs not the crying type. So what will my husband do to me? I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll try to kill me.

174328019,"I've been in this relationship for 10 years now, and it's not going so well...we've been separated for about 6 months now and I had just felt comfortable enough to move back in together because he's gotten off the drugs wasn't drinking and was going to the doctor for his mental health and staying on his medication. Now it's been about two weeks and it's not going so great. It is about every other day my husband is 100% positive that I'm lying to him about something, weather it be that I stole his phone(s), or that I'm hiding secret relationships from him, or that I'm not telling my friends and family that we are living together again. The phones he is talking about he had when we were split up, I never took them, I even searched the whole house looking for them numerous times just to prove to him that I hadn't taken them (mind you this was six months ago when we first split and he entered a rehab for a bit and I had to pack up and move our things out on my own.) I never found them. He keeps telling 
me he is tired of my shit and my lies and that I need to fess up and tell him the truth, and when I tell him the truth he gets mad bc it's not what he believes is the truth. I told him I'd be lying if I told him anything differently than what I've been telling him; that I didn't take the phones, that I've told my friends and family we have moved back in together and working on things, and that I absolutely haven't been doing any kind of sneaking around on him. He still gets mad and says it's bull shit, now after moving out of my friend's place, with no where to go bc I just told everyone my decision of being with him, he's telling me he wants me to go bc I won't fess up to these things. Judging by his pattern tomorrow he will be sorry and say he loves me to death and he doesn't want me to go. So is this his bipolar/schizophrenia or is this truly how he feels? I can't ever get a straight answer out of him. I don't know where I stand in this relationship, I don't feel like I have a stable leg to stand on becaus
e I never know if I'm wanted or hated. He'll be getting his first paycheck from his new job at the end of this week, I was taking care of everything up until then and I feel like this behavior has been getting worse the closer he gets to payday, maybe even working up to the final kick out the door. I apologize for the rant, and for this possibly having nothing to do with what this site is for. I just don't understand what is happening anymore. Is this a normal thing for mental illnesses?"

175895475,"I don't want to doubt your doctor's opinion when I have never met you, as I am not a professional ‚Äî just someone who suffers from the same disorder. I wasn't surprised by my diagnosis at all, as I hear voices and self diagnosed myself as bipolar before I even visited a doctor. This was all when I was 14. Everything will turn out okay if you continue to seek help. If you're seeking help at all, that's a wonderful sign and says a lot about the severity and possible prognosis of your illness. I wish you the best!"

I am pescatarian, so a lot of my meals are very lean. I have a lot of fresh fruits and veggies around, because I love being able to grab a snack and go.

174328025,"I don‚Äôt take meds at least not anything prescribed and don‚Äôt do anything illegal anymore for several years now but I do believe I self medicate with alcohol and cigarettes. I can‚Äôt say that I hear voices at least nothing intelligible but I do hear things that aren‚Äôt there frequently almost as an anticipation. I also believe often that things I hear or see (songs, commercials, e.t.c) are targeted at me through some greater power. I haven‚Äôt seen a psychiatrist in years and when I did they were mostly clueless as to what was wrong with me so were the social workers and professionals that I routinely saw as my mother tried to get an answer to what was wrong with me."

175895493,I decided to restart my YouTube channel. I seem to have really good luck with YouTube but still have always had the fear of video since I been sick. Had 1 mil views and 330 subs before I deleted my old one when I was in the midst of my psychosis. Also had one back when I was a teen with the same stats and deleted that as well. I will try again! I recently got invited to Clubhouse. Which is an invite-only app that you can talk to famous people or well known people and influencers on there personally. I think you have to have some sort of professional thing going on in your life where you‚Äôre in the public eye. That‚Äôs what I think since almost everyone I‚Äôve seen there is. An author from Instagram invited me.

Mental health professionals may use the following terms to describe what you are experiencing: Racing thoughts is when your thoughts go through your head very fast.

175895527,"Searching, You are right. Trying to keep your mind busy, to help to not obsess about it. Washing hands is important. Try to stay calm. People are making money off of other people's fears. It is a sad thing. I can imagine that living in California or any coastal state would cause more fear _NAME_. Just use common sense. I would try to go to less populated areas if possible. But I wouldn't let it cause fear if at all possible. I live in a cold state, so I feel less vulnerable to it. Though you never know what will happen. I have to go to the hospital to get some blood work and I don't like going there. Even less so now. Try to relax _NAME_, stay calm. Worrying doesn't help anything but anxiety. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175895533,No. Don‚Äôt hurt yourself. What is money? It‚Äôs a construct that makes too much of our attention. You need to concentrate on getting well. Others have been there. I‚Äôve been there. I‚Äôve cost my family thousands of dollars. I just try to help out my family now even though I don‚Äôt work. Please. Don‚Äôt turn the anger and frustration inwards. You need to wok on getting well firstly. All else follows. You aren‚Äôt making good decisons when your in the self loathing. It‚Äôs not good for the soul. Most of us have been in the dark or on the edge of the abyss but we‚Äôve come out the other side. Be strong. Get well First. Decisions about things later.

175895535,I had to deal with 'social security once' and it caused me a lot of distress. I Am now terrified of having to endure being 'dehumanized' by people dumber than me. But i'll have to 'suck it up'. Ironic how those with mental health issues are the least able to deal with bureaucratic sh'it and therefore often avoid seeking the help they need. Yet they are entitled to certain services more than most who sail through that sh'it.

174328037,"First Rule - Take your Bloody Medication. Dont start moaning about ‚Äúside effects‚Äù ‚Äúi cant sleep‚Äù ‚Äúi sleep too much‚Äù - SUCK IT UP. Sometimes it takes a while to adjust to your medication. Moaning at your Psych Doctor when you only been on them a month aint gonna do much good. And just because your feeling better - IS NOT an excuse to stop taking them. Learn some coping skills - Try to use a bit of logic. Did your neighbour really call you a wanker!?? Or are you just paranoid!?? Take some resposibilty for your illness - and take ownership of it. Its no-ones fault (including your own) so dont start blaming your family or friends or whatever. It is not a death sentance - you can have a normal life with schizophrenia. Stay away from drugs, and yes that includes weed and alcohol - the meds your on simply dont mix - and it effects the efficacy of the drugs your taking."
175895537,"The only guy, and also I assume the only turtle?"
175895538,Yeah can be tough depending on the med. I‚Äôm not sure how long as we are all different but I‚Äôd think a week or so will be better. Most meds are absorbed pretty quickly and leave just as fast.

175895590,"I feel computers are limited to our intelligence since we make them. Computers may be able to focus more and not sleep, but I feel our intelligence and sciences are founded on a long tedious process of many experiments and observations. When humans make connections, sometimes those connections can be wrong. We have to do a scientific investigation, usually spanning many years, to feel more confident in the connection. Sometimes a logical conclusion isn‚Äôt always an observed result. Theories aren‚Äôt always practical. The modern scientific investigation requires gathering relevant information. So a computer would likely be limited to only what information it can scavenge. I think some primitive forms of artificial intelligence use the internet to gather information, which is horrible because the internet can have a lot of misinformation. Then the computer would have to make an hypothesis after reviewing the gathered information. This would require some ability to accurately summarize and simplify i
nformation to make logical connections. The computer would then need to design an experiment, gather materials, and execute the experiment. This would seem to be very very difficult for a computer to do alone, since computers currently can‚Äôt secure things as easily as humans can. The computer would likely have virtual representations or simulations of earthly materials within itself or its program. Maybe having a database of chemical elements can aid this, but this is overall extremely difficult because we don‚Äôt know the entire composition of certain earthly things. There also may be new chemical elements that we haven‚Äôt yet discovered on this earth. The experiment would virtually take place within the computer, which is against the nature of an experiment. An experiment is suppose to test a theory or hypothesis, and must be done in a practical or real-life environment or setting. It should not be done under a virtual environment of digitally bounded or limited objects, else it‚Äôs just another very fan
cy theory. Our intelligence is more founded on a series of many scientific investigations of the same subjects in different environments or under different factors. So a computer would have to execute many linked scientific investigations on their own, possibly through a string of logic. Again though, logical conclusions aren‚Äôt always observed results. Even if computers were able to successfully do scientific investigations, I don‚Äôt think computers would ever be able to fast-forward time. They may come to conclusions faster, but solid theories would not be discovered too impressively fast I‚Äôd think. The solid theories probably wouldn‚Äôt be accurate anyhow, since the virtual conclusions might have been wrong in a practical world. If you do want to continue studying academia, then you can definitely study artificial intelligence and try to program computers to do scientific investigations."

175895653,"The final task given to the PhotoReading expert was to read the three chapters from the textbook on Physiology in order to take an exam from a course that used that textbook. The question was simply: Would she pass the exam? The expert took 73 minutes to PhotoRead and read the three chapters of the textbook required for the test (i.e., 361 words per minute). She PhotoRead for 9 minutes the night before taking the test. The following morning, she read the text using various rapid reading and activation techniques. She then answered the questions. She completed the 6 true/false and 30 multiple choice questions, but did not attempt to answer the fill-in-the-blank or short-answer questions. Hence, comprehension performance on the conceptual questions was 0 percent. She answered 2 of 7 multiple-choice prior knowledge questions correctly (29%). Of the text relevant questions, she answered 4 of 6 true/false questions correctly (67%), and 8 of 23 multiple-choice question correctly (35%). This performance i
s extremely low and only slightly above chance level performance for these types of questions (i.e., 50% and 25%, respectively). In sum, she did not pass the exam. It is important to note that after PhotoReading the text (but before taking the test), she rated her understanding of the material as 4.5 on a 5-point scale (5 representing a good understanding). Moreover, she estimated that she would remember approximately 68 percent of the material for the test, with a grade of C+.

So that means sprint (not full out, not completely up on toes, then roll into a jog then sprint then roll into a jog) again, the jog should be quick enough where my heart rate remains elevated. It was easy, because you don‚Äôt get hot. I read you don‚Äôt feel the cold as much on days with high humidity, so I try and take advantage of that. I take cues from _NAME_‚Äôs youtube channel, where one his constants is HIIT. As I take it, his idea is high intensity, but no pushing, lock it in then start again after recovery."

175895683,I haven‚Äôt mentioned it to my pdoc or therapist because I‚Äôm scared they might lock me in a psych ward

175895688,I know i only got it last year i wish i had it a long time ago They should give it to therapists to use for patients lol. I find a lot of therapist are inexperience with psychosis. Atleast the one i dealt with

175895690,Was just prescribed gabapentin by my primary care physician for some nerve pain. I took my first dose last night and found that it made me eerily calm. Does anyone take it for anxiety?
175895691,I just feel like the forum is biased in favor of finding people delusional when they really might not be. This is dangerous I think.
175895692,"_PERSON_ but I don""t remember it. I saw it long time ago."
175895693,"They can pick up on our anxiety. It is real important that you are calm and assertive. I have a problem with that myself. But I think I am getting the hang of it. Do you ever watch the Dog Whisperer? It is on National Geographic Wild sometimes. I learn a lot from that. We tend to treat our pets like people and they don't have a chance to be a dog. But we love them none the less. How many steps do you have to go down? I hope not a lot. Maybe three steps at a time would work. My dog loves food so sometimes I can coax her with food, but not always. Get her to go down three steps and then give her a treat??? I know how important it is to be able to walk your dog. I took mine today. She is still a pup and working on things, but she is getting better. Hang in there... Hugs, _NAME_..."

175895700,Hi _AT_MENTION_ buddy I‚Äôve started Vraylar yesterday
175895701,I would love to get cross examined by a lawyer or prosecuter in a fantasy sense because my dads a defense attorney and I am familiar with lawyers. But I don‚Äôt break laws or anything and I‚Äôm happy that nobody wants to sue me or prosecute me but if it ever came up haha bring it on!
174328068,I really hope I never get someone who is intersting in me and even if they are I will always try to escape them. Bringing a kid to this world that would have to suffer the same things I‚Äôm going through is a very selfish idea. I really hope I never do that and I don‚Äôt change opinion about that.
175895702,Time will tell‚Ä¶
175895703,Thanks everyone
175895704,"thanks fadetoblack. i can‚Äôt ask that but maybe i can try to confront it in other ways like asking them if they‚Äôre upset about anything because i am getting that impression type of thing. that might relieve me of some of my frustration at not being able to handle my own life but i doubt it will help the situation any better than that. thanks again, _NAME_"

175895706,"I would probably read a lot more than I do. I already read a lot. But, I would read even more. Before I got a computer, I used to go to restaurants and sit and drink their bottomless coffee and just sit there for hours and hours drinking coffee. Kind of like my father used to do. Only now, I would have to take a cab since I no longer own a car or drive."

175895709,I eat out almost everyday. But I am cooking this weekend.
175895710,I hear ya. I‚Äôll only take what is recommended on the tin though. I‚Äôm reading studies about White Willow Bark and am getting kind of scared now though. There are spotty reports of liver and kidney damage from it. I might just cancel the order.
175895711,I would prefer not to have this illness. At least I‚Äôm one of the fortunate ones who functions in spite of it and who has very well managed symptoms.
175895712,"Did this thought come out of nowhere, did it cause you to feel anxiety? I ask because I get violent thoughts all the time and I know I wouldn‚Äôt do them. I think they are called intrusive thoughts."
175895713,It makes me angry to rewatch things but not necessarily to reread things. It also upsets me to rehear statements people say over and over to me.
175895714,I‚Äôve heard of them both.
175895715,At least it wasn‚Äôt a pube?
175895716,"I just don‚Äôt see how all those things can make more sense to you than the simple, obvious answer: you have schizophrenia and your mind is playing tricks on you. You will never shake your delusions if you refuse to admit they might not be real. I don‚Äôt know if think you‚Äôre an mk experiment or some alien hybrid or whatever makes you feel special, but it‚Äôs a million times more likely you‚Äôre just a schizophrenic with an overactive imagination."
175895717,"I too have experienced debilitating panic/anxiety attacks. When I‚Äôm in it, conscious breath is a must, walking backwards or jumping on trampoline stops brain function of the train flying down the tracks and makes it change up the energy. And dancing or comedy brings in a playfulness. It‚Äôs not easy because we never know what‚Äôs going to bring them on. However that said, I‚Äôve upped my game of doing online meditations to help keep me balanced so it‚Äôs less likely to rear it‚Äôs ugly head. Good luck. And.... money wise.... You Are Worth Every Penny it costs you to have a peaceful life. Just sayin??"
175895718,"You can get a bloodtest, but they will most likely come back normal because orthodox medicine test only uncovers extreme deficiency. Like if you imagine a scale of green, yellow and red, everything in the yellow zone will come back as normal. You could test yourself with a alternative practitioner like a biopat or herbalist if they offer it, but that will probably be expensive. It‚Äôs a great idea to use your own body as a means of measuring if something is good or bad for you though. Let your body speak to you. Try it for a week and if you still get anxious there might be something in the formula that is bad for you. For example some people react to b-vitamins in supplement form. You could try to find a multisupplement without b-vitamins if this doesen‚Äôt work for you. It‚Äôs also possible that it is enough to take it every other day or third day. Just got to experiment to find your personal balance."

With all the weight and all the meds I just don‚Äôt see it. I‚Äôll probably have a heart attack. Although I am getting my heart checked so maybe it will be okay, I don‚Äôt know. Maybe a stroke. Maybe kidney failure or liver failure. These things come on quickly sometimes don‚Äôt they? Who knows. But I would have a better chance if I would take better care of myself."

175895796,"Interesting that all the schizoids on here claim they don't do any of these things. My schizoid would claim the same. He's always perfect and unapologetic and always rationalizes everything he does wrong. Therefore, he might also say ""no"" to all of these. Avoidance - Avoidance is the practice of withdrawing from relationships with other people as a defensive measure to reduce the risk of rejection, accountability, criticism or exposure. He's really anti-social. Not sure if he does it for these reasons. Belittling, Condescending and Patronizing - Belittling, condescending & patronizing speech is a passive-aggressive approach to giving someone a verbal put-down while maintaining a facade of reasonableness or friendliness. Yes. He's patronizing. Treats me like a child. Makes me feel like a child. I feel like I can't be an adult around him. He also acts like I'm crazy, stupid, have stupid ideas, etc. He also says it in his tone of voice. Chronic Broken Promises - Repeatedly making and then breaking c
ommitments and promises is a common trait among people who suffer from personality disorders. Yes. Not ""promises"" per say, but it's like he lives in a fantasy world. Rarely anything he says is going to happen will ever really happen. Circular Conversations - Circular Conversations are arguments which go on almost endlessly, repeating the same patterns with no real resolution. Yes. He has a way of twisting logic or avoiding relevant subject matter so he can get away with things. Cognitive Dissonance - Cognitive Dissonance is a psychological term for the discomfort that most people feel when they encounter information which contradicts their existing set of beliefs or values. People who suffer from personality disorders often experience cognitive dissonance when they are confronted with evidence that their actions have hurt others or have contradicted their stated morals. Yes. He's definitely a huge hypocrite. He does many of the things that he claims he doesn't believe in. Confirmation Bias - Confirmation _P
ERSON_ is the tendency to pay more attention to things which reinforce your beliefs than to things which contradict them. Not sure. But it's hard to imagine how he holds on to his beliefs without it. ""Control-Me"" Syndrome - ""Control-Me"" Syndrome describes a tendency that some people have to foster relationships with people who have a controlling narcissistic, antisocial or ""acting-out"" nature.

175895798,"There‚Äôs no people that don‚Äôt have any mental problems at all. I wouldn‚Äôt call them mentally ill though. If the question would be ‚Äúdo all the people have mental problems‚Äù then yes, more or less."

175895801,You can get sildenifil cheap on GoodRx. It helps my husband. He takes three at a time instead of just one. He also takes it on an empty stomach for it to work best
175895802,"This is just messed up. I already knew that being on these damn meds was messing up with my cognition, just ask my brain four years ago compared to my brain now! We need greater help for negative symptoms, not terrible medications that make cognition worse when it is already impaired! My greatest impairment is no longer hallucinations, it is this cognitive burden I live with every day that doesn‚Äôt permit me to work or to even feel like a human being. Just wow."
175895803,Thats a good way of putting it _AT_MENTION_ I‚Äôd definitely agree. When _PERSON_ had a couple of drinks I can be very chatty and in the moment.
175895804,I‚Äôve had them according to my doctor but you don‚Äôt believe in it so its ok
175895805,No just what I have. This nor a common occurance.
175895806,Is it really a normal and healthy part of grief?
175895807,I did read it all. It‚Äôs interesting lol. Thought ultimately there was a small lack of continuity in what your saying about being cured 100 percent. Also who is _NAME_? Is that name simply being used interchangeably for your husband. Any reader is going to ask that.
175895808,"Okay, best to listen to your therapist of course. He sounds like he has a solid plan for you. We care about you and are cheering you on. Sending thoughts of peace and progress your way today! S.C."

175895813,"Seemingly they thought I needed a mentor to take me out for walks, to leave my room and help me in my transition towards independant living. I met him today, I liked him, but I couldn‚Äôt help the sneaky suspicion the devil might be behind all this, to led me astray and back on the path to normative normalcy. Time will tell."
175895814,How much do you take?
175895815,"IDK why I stopped. Tonight I cooked two dishes, it was the first time I cooked in at least two months. The last thing I cooked was split pea soup with ham; I had a few bowls then froze the rest. I thawed some out a couple weeks ago but I didn‚Äôt eat it fast enough and it went bad-had to throw it out. Now tonight I made chicken stew. Took some prep work but it wasn‚Äôt that hard. It came out great. Cooked a turkey, sour cream, cream cheese, egg noodle cheesy casserole. It came out perfect. Again, not really that hard. But I had spent way too much on groceries these past two months and I need to save money and I need variety in my diet. So hopefully I‚Äôll get back into cooking."
175895816,I loved smoking when I smoked. I also used to love drinking back when I drank. I was fortunate enough to quit both before the SZ really got hold of me. My main problem now is sugar.
175895817,"I wonder how many Shills are on this site. I‚Äôm not being specific about anyone, really. No offense."

175895818,_PERSON_ u might need the hospital _NAME_. To stay safe.
175895819,Not you !
175895820,"That does sound like a dilemma. All i can say is weigh up your options - look at the pro and cons of each choice. Perhaps do a little research into SSDI and do up a mock budget to help you look at what your likely expenses are going to be when you aren‚Äôt working. Are they going to be covered by the SSDI. I like what _AT_MENTION_ suggested - maybe go for a holiday first and get a feel for it. Whatever you decide, i hope it makes you happy."
175895821,"Yeah, _AT_MENTION_ is a godsend for us musicians on this site. Hey _PERSON_‚Ä¶did you check out that musician‚Äôs website I PM‚Äôd you about? Just curious."

175895855,Lol. A long time ago when I was in a relationship I watched this movie called Mulholland Drive or something like that. It had a scene with some nudity with the actress _NAME_. My girlfriend was not happy I was ogling her. She nearly slapped me and threw a fit. I let her know that the actress didn‚Äôt compare to her. Then we talked about the birds and the bees. ah those days were fun. The song Brown Eyed Girl still reminds me of her sometimes.

I 100% can relate to feeling like your letting your family down or feeling like a loser because your not in a position other people feel you should be in.

I‚Äôm going to attend an online open house for the grad school that I‚Äôm interested in applying. I am hoping to ask questions if they allow me. It is tonight. I worked this morning again. Waking up and being present online is in itself half the task. Teaching is the other half. I do like teaching. I am tired most of the time. I don‚Äôt do much though. Working online is not that hard. But, my schedule is difficult. I will see how the open house goes tonight. I hope to be informed and excited afterwards. I have much to do but feel apathetic. I force myself to finish my tasks. I don‚Äôt want to wake up early each morning. But, I need to eat and survive. I can‚Äôt qualify for disability so I don‚Äôt have any other option but to work. Life sucks at times. I‚Äôm on my own minding my business and working. I wish I could just 
do what interests me. I need money though to pursue my interests. It is a vicious circle of working and pursuing my interests versus not working and not surviving.

174328121,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Global DNA hypomethylation and its correlation to the betaine level in peripheral blood of patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry , Jan 2020 03 Accumulating evidence suggests that aberrant epigenetic regulation is involved in the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). We previously showed that the plasma level of betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine), a methyl-group donor, was significantly decreased in patients with first episode schizophrenia (FESZ). In this study, we identified decrease of global DNA methylation level in FESZ (N?=?24 patients vs N?=?42 controls), and found that global DNA methylation level was inversely correlated with scores on the global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale, and positively correlated with plasma betaine level. Notably, correlations bet
ween levels of betaine and its metabolites (N,N-dimethylglycine and sarcosine, N-methylglycine) were lower or lost in FESZ plasma, but remained high in controls. We further examined LINE-1 DNA methylation levels in patients with chronic SZ (N?=?388) and BD (N?=?414) as well as controls (N?=?430), and confirmed significant hypomethylation and decreased betaine level in SZ. We also found that patients with BD type I, but not those with BD type II, showed significant global hypomethylation. These results suggest that global hypomethylation associated with decreased betaine level in blood cells is common to SZ and BD, and may reflect common pathophysiology such as psychotic symptoms. Hmm, some more data on betaine and sarcosine. I don‚Äôt think they ever did get around to doing a trial of sarcosine in high risk or first episode people. This suggests that might be a good avenue to follow up. Notably, correlations between levels of betaine and its metabolites (N,N-dimethylglycine and sarcosine, N-methylglycine) wer
e lower or lost in FESZ plasma, but remained high in controls."

This could get your through some rough spots until you learn some good self help tools. That brings us to the next suggestion of self help and/or therapy. Have you any experience with either? If not, please see our Resources for great links that teach self calming for stopping/lessening a panic attack.

175896052,"Religion. Also some info about ‚Äúriches in heaven‚Äù. Apparently there is money there, but it is more closely aligned to a person‚Äôs good will, so it is okay to revere. Reason why earthly wealth is shunned by religion is because it doesn‚Äôt go with you, and can make you compromise your morals. Apparently you get donations for your affairs as well. All stored in a spiritual bank account of sorts. So your suffering isn‚Äôt for naught."

175896060,"I hate the tv pretty much. I hate the noise mostly. I like the occasional show if it‚Äôs not too offensive but the noise is a deal breaker. I‚Äôm pretty open about this. My ex selects tv shows that are things like auctions, which are noise pollution and he‚Äôll put it on all day till 2am. Mind you I have no where to go to get away from the noise, I live in the front room. Right now he‚Äôs watching burn outs and drag racing and it‚Äôs cars revving their engines and peeling out. And it‚Äôs been going on for hours. How many peel outs do you need to see? So my question is do you think he‚Äôs trying to drive me insane? Do you think he‚Äôs out to get me? Do you think he watches these things to hurt me? Do you think he picks the loudest most annoying things on purpose? Or am I being paranoid?"

175896066,"Back in the early 60s to mid 70s, when I was at school, there was nothing like the help and support there is now. Though even now things could and should be better. The non academic things that made going to college/uni too difficult were never tackled. That was because nobody within mental health services etc saw the things that made it too difficult. It took 46 years to get the dx that was a major reason for those difficulties. You can also throw in severe social anxiety as another source of non academic difficulty. There was no point at which going to college/uni was viable, because there has never been the help and support to make that possible. The point at which any potential I had peaked was when I was 16, and had done O levels. Things went downhill from there. I was bright enough to know that I was not up to coping with the non academic side of college/uni life. Yet I was expected to be the 1st one to do so. When you‚Äôre in a constant state of hyper anxiety, as I was, it really ***** you u

175896068,"No, because sexual abuse started early. Being ignored by my mother was the first thing to happen. After that came my first psychosis on the first school day in fifth grade. It has gone on for two years. Then I switched school. Skateboarding was nice the first two years. After that it wasn‚Äôt about fun to skate. Everybody else just wasted their time or quit with skating because of trying to get a sponsorship. Bodybuilding sucked. One half year of aggressive inline couldn‚Äôt rescue my psychy. I always since rape heard voices, because of being bullied I started getting ticks, visual and auditory hallucinations and violent thoughts. I also got commands I resistet. Mostly beating the bullys in the face. The bad, I‚Äôm unable to commit suicide. So that will be a long road of suffering."

174328139,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Association of smoked cannabis with treatment resistance in schizophrenia. A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, O Ayonrinde, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research , Jun 2019 18 Association of cannabis use with schizophrenia is a well-established finding. Its role in causation, however, is debated. Different studies have found that cannabis use impacts the outcome of schizophrenia and is associated with treatment non-adherence and a higher rate of relapses. In this paper, we investigated the impact of self-reported cannabis use on treatment response in a cohort of schizophrenia patients from Pakistan, a middle-income country. The data was collected from a psychiatric hospital in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan where cannabis use is prevalent. Clinical evaluation and therapeutic response were established using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Clinical Global Impressions Scales-Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scale. Lack of response to adequate treatm
ent with two trials of antipsychotics was classed as treatment resistance. We compared the treatment-resistant and treatment responsive groups for different variables including cannabis use, age at onset of illness, duration of untreated psychosis and consanguinity. We had data on 230 patients. More than ninety percent of our participants were men. The rate of treatment resistance was over 60%. Ongoing use of cannabis had an association with treatment resistance. We only included cases where treatment adherence was not a problem."

174328145,"Hello ! I wanted to see if anyone here has any experience with what I‚Äôm wondering about. I am diagnosed schizophrenia and as of late, say about 3 to 4 months, I can‚Äôt drink alcohol without my voices getting worse , really aggressive and personal‚Ä¶ I was able to drink just about every weekend and a lot of times heavily without any problems for 7 straight months before this started, and during that time only had positive voices, constantly This happened after I moved into a new apartment with a new job and my drinking kind of turned into a 2 month streak with some drugs unfortunately coming around on a few occasions (uppers)‚Ä¶ After that my voices got really nasty , aggressive , extremely personal, humiliating. I cut down after that I really miss being able to have a drink every now and then so I can catch a break from it but it just gets worse when I do‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt relax or enjoy anything the way I used to. Might be considered a sign one should NOT drink‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm constantly so bored, and 
have to much energy, and the voices are beating me up every minute. Anyways , basically my question is Has anyone been able to drink as you please for a longer time while diagnosed with schizophrenia without any problems just for it to suddenly turn on you ?"
175896077,"I don‚Äôt understand your disputes. Do you think someone is using your card without your knowledge to make fraudulent purchases? I‚Äôm not accusing you of anything but hopefully you‚Äôre not getting reimbursed for charges you made on purpose. What are all these fraudulent purchases? And if someone is consistently using your card to make illegal charges than deal with it. Years ago my housemate made several fraudulent charges on my credit card. My credit card company had a fraud department and I worked with them to get reimbursed and then it was up to them afterwards to take legal action against the guy. That‚Äôs what fraud departments do. Don‚Äôt just let someone consistently make fraudulent charges on your credit card. Tell the credit card company and they will probably close the account and open a new, safe secure credit card account. If the problem is fraudulent sellers on Amazon or somewhere else, go to the main source and report it. The goal is to stop these illegal transactions for good."

They‚Äôre either convincing me that I do not deserve to feel okay when I feel okay or confirming that I am bad when I‚Äôve messed up. Can‚Äôt win really.

175896117,I woke up anxious again so I did some meditation and feel a lot better. It's a really pretty day out so far and I want to feel positive but worry that the delusional intrusions will wreck my day. I'll try to focus on my impending visit with my sister--we get together every Friday--which I always look forward to. I guess I can choose to NOT let the intrusions get to me even if they appear which they probably will. Meditation really helps soothe me when they start to get to me. I often do a-few-minute sessions scattered throughout the day; i just close my eyes and try to calm down and clear my mind which usually works. I had my T session yesterday and we talked about my getting back into my DBT books to come up with some more coping skills to handle the anxiety and hypervigilance that are caused by the presence of the delusions. I've got two workbooks that I've used in the past and I'll pull them out right now so I don't forget. (Just did it.) DBT is wonderful. I hope you all hand in there today. I'm

174328173,"I used to think schizoaffective was exactly the same as schizophrenia except you had mood symptoms tacked on too. Im learning now that schizophrenia is very different than sza and it presents very differently. I can understand now why some professionals said I was too ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù/‚Äúnormal‚Äù to have sz. To me it always seemed like sza should be more severe than sz since there is a mood component too but that is not the case from what I have seen. People with sza i have noticed don‚Äôt get flat affects and seem to have normal social skills compared to people with sz, who tend not to show emotion and be very withdrawn and give very limited responses to things if at all. Also, I still have not yet met one sz person who was able to say ‚Äúyes i have sz and hear voices and have delusions‚Äù but I have met many people with sza who say ‚Äúyes i hear voices‚Äù etc. It seems they have a better chance at developing insight. (Obviously I know people with sz do develop insight bc of here but I‚Äôm 
just saying it seems more commonly those w sza develop insight). Those are the differences I have noticed, aside from the mood symptoms. I hesitate to say schizoaffective seems less severe, as the psychosis seems to be just as extreme in both, but it definitely seems that those with sza have a better chance of being ‚Äúnormal passing‚Äù if that makes sense due to the presence of social skills/expression."

At least once a day, I get triggered by an intrusion and I'll try to calm myself practicing DBT, particularly distraction (reading, music). DBT is for anxiety and psychosis is an anxiety disorder so they work well together. I'm interested in what people do here to deal with intrusions that try to send them into psychosis, if anyone is comfortable sharing about this.

And I still have a good attitude towards work. But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I love getting off early. I love having time off on holidays. I like taking a 5 minute break to rest sometimes during the day.

175896175,"Thanks for sharing this video. I enjoyed watching it. I feel badly for a lot of men on the spectrum when they talk about being alone and not having many friends growing up. There is no doubt that I am also on the spectrum, but many autistic women learn to mask, which is basically impersonating a more neurotypical person in social situations. This has its drawbacks, but it saved me from being a loner or a target back in grade school. Of course never feeling like you can be yourself definitely sucks. Also, whenever there‚Äôs a video about an autistic person, I know there‚Äôs a 90% chance there‚Äôs going to be cats in it."

When I get stressed it all comes back to me, and I struggle to even eat or take my meds. Luckily those times are fewer and further apart, but they still happen.

When I asked him why he attacked his father and uncle the other night he said because they gave him a fright.

I‚Äôm scared of him sometimes - and he‚Äôs scared of me sometimes too! As I said - its quite toxic.

174328191,"I am crazy Greetings. I am a crazy middle aged man that was never formally diagnosed but suffer from severe and exact symptoms since winter 2015 at least. I expect the reader to need not any reminders or explanations to what they are, since I publish this text on a dedicated forum. Instead, I would like to use this unexpected moment of clarity to maybe give some hints on early warning signs. Then I will share my delusions and ask for advice. Oddities as a kid I had odd habits and behaviours as a kid. I believe if adults knew what they are dealing with, my ‚Äútragedy‚Äù could have been avoided. I once read an article where the writer lamented the lack of documentation on early signs of potential schizophrenia issues, hence this writing. I made up new gibberish words or assigned different meaning to real words. I made up stories rougly based on something that I heard or observed previously and basically lie as if they really happened. Obviously parents figured me out but never said anythinig until I 
grew up. I believe if they confronted me about these stories it would have improved my development. More notably, I would do similar in public gaverings or aquantances. I secluded myself and talked to myself gibberish uncontrollably, based on invented terms mentioned previously. Parents knew this and lovingly mocked me about it, but didn‚Äôt seem concerned. I had subconscious terror before rape. Not being victim of rape myself, but having any female raped. Notably, I did not even know the word or had any knowledge that this was possible or happened at the time. Just having a cartoon female character restrained was enough to have me feel very uneasy. I never talked about this with anyone. About a year before I started to hear voices, when I was a young man already, I started to tear my hair and eyebrows with bare hands and later yet shaved my skull. Recently I talked with an old woman who admitted to have schizophrenia too. Notably, she told me a story about how she as a kid shaved her head smooth. Apparently, 
just to feel the skin with her hand. I did not have an imaginary friend, but my mother did, and she went insane too, around summer 2015. I did fantasise or wish or dream for a special female friend however. Of course I never thought it was unusual for a male, but it turned out to be a problem when I became an adult. Note, most numbered issues continued until around 2008, when I was around 15 years old, and were on the decline. I started to hear voices when I was around 20 years old in 2015. Delusions of grandure Oddly, my mother and uncle went insane with very similar symptomes to mine a few monts prior to me. I went insane myself overnight after talking to them and one another person. Not sure about my uncle, but all four of us suffer from ‚Äúvoices‚Äù. It all started with voices and later ‚Äúmemories from past life‚Äù. The content of this particular ‚Äúmemory‚Äù was cripplingly traumatic. I cried for at least ten minutes. Over the following three years more ‚Äúmemories‚Äù appeared, mostly grandiouse and ple
asant, but many painful too. I had background in Hindu religions, gaudiya-vaishnava in particular. I apostated from christianity at around 2010. Delusions reflected that. I skip on even further details unless they are needed for some reason. Glimpse of clarity In 2016 schizophrenia completely and irreversibly ruined my studies, career and budding relationship with a girlfriend. I heard voices every fifteen minutes for around six years, peppered with delusions, false notions etc. I did try to work on personal software projects and even managed to relase some tiny software components that had 3-10 users. It is nothing like I did when I was sane and studying and working normally. Miraculously, after a round of some mental acrobatics, in late October 2020 voices almost completely stopped and delusions weakened significantly for at least a week, hence this text. I still fail to concentrate and pay attention for more than half an hour. I am poor, uneducated, and my country prepares to abolish mental institutions co
mpletely. What can I do to maintain clarity?"

This is stated by an expert whose article I read and from my own personal exper- ience. Everyone or most everyone has fear that things won‚Äôt work out. So giving reassur-ance was one of the ways I made friends in the first place and why I think I had value to them. I just wanted them to like me."

175896240,"I‚Äôd like to have a fulfilling life where I see lots of art and travel a lot and go on lots of activities like hikes and walks and just enjoy my time left on earth. I‚Äôd like to have a family and make my uncle proud by bringing a guy home. I‚Äôd like to have a big wedding with lots of friends. I‚Äôd like to be stable on meds because as long as I‚Äôm stable and not being wrecked by side effects, life‚Äôs already pretty good. It‚Äôs really an added bonus if I can work for the time being and loose some weight."

175896245,"Oh I forgot to say, I hope it gets better, yes I‚Äôd definitely tell the pdoc and they can decide how important it is.

174328197,"Well done. I‚Äôm totally estranged from my abusive mother for my own safety. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for me. I was abused constantly too from birth, and developed psychotic symptoms & schizophrenia at a very young age as a result. I‚Äôm in my mid-40‚Äôs now and my psychotic symptoms resemble the abuse, except instead of mother-dear being the abuser it‚Äôs the current person in my life who‚Äôs disrespected/ offended/ invalidated/ ignored me. My ap‚Äôs take the terror down a notch to high anxiety but do little to reduce the psychotic symptoms. I just live with them & mask them so no-one knows. Yeah, it‚Äôd be good for you to stop abusing yourself. You gotta break the cycle. Your counsellor sounds good. I try to be good to myself by exercising every day, eating right and I‚Äôm trying to cut down on alcohol. My rage isn‚Äôt directed at myself like yours, I‚Äôm a bit different in that my rage is generally directed at the last person who disrespected/invalidated me‚Ä¶so that makes friendships and relationsh

Took me a long, long time. Got a fitness tracker eventually and now it‚Äôs become second nature. Simple advice. Force yourself to exercise and tick off goals. Start small but routine and regular is the key. I know it‚Äôs hard. I sat on a couch or chair for a decade at least‚Ä¶You have nothing to lose but you‚Äôll gain for sure."

It‚Äôs very dangerous to do and I can‚Äôt recommend it, but it got my point across that if she didnt work with me I was just going to go rogue. I love my current prescriber because he always listens to me and says oh that‚Äôs what works for you? Great let‚Äôs do that! We need more doctors who are willing to listen to their patients.

I still have pills leftover and only took it when needed if I felt off. My question is if I start taking it again, will it be effective instantly or will it take a while to start working again?"
175896263,That‚Äôs great that you can get your drums this way.

May just be the withdrawals from caffeine that makes me stressed, I don‚Äôt know. But I haven‚Äôt been feeling the effects of the omega 3 the last couple days, or not much anyway. I keep telling myself that me not feeling the effects of the omega 3 has nothing to do with whether I consume caffeine or not. And it doesn‚Äôt make sense that it would. I also think that ever since I bought a new bottle of omega 3 pills I haven‚Äôt been feeling the effect as much as I used to. Is it possible that I‚Äôve gotten a ‚Äúfaulty‚Äù bottle of pills?

175896317,"Guys, there is tons of research on this, and there‚Äôs no reason to base your opinions on biased journalists who get paid to paint a particular story. Mental illness, excluding drug use, is minimally related to violence (including homicide). That means there is in fact a ‚Äúclear link‚Äù, just like there is a clear link between walking at least 10 meters a day and being a pro athlete. It‚Äôs just that that link is pretty small.

175896330,"Firstly Schizological1, I'm sorry you've had a falling out with your family. I think that both the diagnosis and the contributing factors for personality disorders are so uncertain that it is dangerous to work backwards by assuming that because someone has a particular diagnosis they must have had a particular experience. It's even more dangerous to go a step further and assume that if they don't remember such an experience, it must have happened and been erased. I don't want to say too much about my own family experience, because it veers too close to revealing personally identifiable details. I will say that my parents weren't abusive or particularly neglectful. To the extent that I had a traumatic childhood, it was because I already preferred to be in my own head than around other people, and I could hardly ever escape from being around other people. I'm annoyed at my parents for creating that situation, but they were trying to do the right thing in difficult circumstances. I find it annoying to 
be expected to be part of the family I grew up in. I feel close to a couple of siblings, but mostly family is annoying obligation. I feel like I'm expected to play the role of affectionate son and brother so that they can enjoy being in a close family. I particularly hate Christmas and similar events."

I stopped Aug 1st, took till August 28 to stop the reaction, was on 4 allergy meds for it, what a mess. Got rid of pdoc and my therapist filed a complaint against her about it. I have a bad reaction to all APs so this one was a like Saphris for me. Swollen tongue and throat, couldn‚Äôt breathe or sleep."
174328206,It became too much during quarantine. I couldn‚Äôt handle going in and being so paranoid of being in public when this all started.

174328213,"Most of us agree to not tell an employer about being schizophrenic in the hiring process. While they‚Äôre not supposed to discriminate, they do. Wait until after being hired, if at all. They don‚Äôt need to know your illness for I surance to cover meds. Also, this forum is searchable through Google. I suggest changing your name to avoid showing up to anyone you may know or an employer. If you give me a scree name I can change it for you."
175896333,Sounds a good plan. I agree your psydoc sounds thorough and that is good. Hope it all goes well for you. Can be stressful changing meds but it also can be so worthwhile down the track.
175896334,"Oh, youare almost like me You want a recovery and me too, i dont like my life as it is now‚Ä¶ Well, try to push a bit, positivity helps. Try things that you couldnt do before by babing steps if you need. On me too the meds dont work fully till a recovery, i suffered a lot cause not a single med didnt help me in my life. My pdoc said to pay efforts now, to try to regain some life too‚Ä¶ Me, i have my paranoia which makes me run away from the people. But i guess, that we should try to exteriorize some symptoms‚Ä¶ Talk, shout, scream, cry when you need it, just run away from the darkness as the best if you can. Maybe youll need time, maybe we should still be patient though. One question _AT_MENTION_ , me i have fears too and paranoia, i see that you are prescrived clonazepam too. You take it daily since 2019? I wonder if we can develop an addiction to it, thats all. But i also need it, it helps some‚Ä¶ For the rest, me personnaly i am on zyprexa and clonazepam. But the zyprexa is very sedative, i take 
it causemy paranoia is strong and this med still struggles to help more Take care p.s. Yesterday ive thought of the movie ‚Äò‚ÄòFight club‚Äô‚Äô, i guess you know the movie.

175896354,"I understand that is quite an achievement for you, _AT_MENTION_ well done!"
175896355,Minimal dose is the key. Don‚Äôt stop without a doctors guidance. Chances are you come back and meds don‚Äôt work as well. You need more of a dose to get the same result. That is the problem with psych meds‚Ä¶it really is a big gamble to stop.

God vs the devil, etc, money is the root of all evil, the capitalist pigs must be brought down. The greatest trick the devil ever did was convincing the world it existed, money is a representation of wealth and doesn‚Äôt really exist except as a concept, money is the devil, messiah vs the elite ruling class and wealth and status as a construct etc. Ended up doing it multiple times and getting a rep for it in town, I think it was connected to my lawsuit because a guy randomly attacked me, perhaps as retribution from the bar(s) (they‚Äôre a close knit business organization in my town and feel almost like the mafia), I hurt the guy real bad though with my crazy strength and ended up doing time. I didn‚Äôt mean any harm, though, initially I was telepathically communicating my credit card number to the bartender and in the latter my instincts just took over, felt like I was possessed by‚Ä¶dare I say it‚Ä¶_PE

175896367,Be patient and keep bothering them thats what I do
175896368,"I‚Äôm sure it is. Just try to make it perfectly clear to your psychiatrist, that SSRI type medications make you feel worse. It took me years to wean down off of the dosage of Effexor I was on. Now I just take 5-HTP, which is a precursor to serotonin. You cannot take them together"
175896369,"Life sucks... sometimes I wish I was never born or existed. Then I wouldn't know what it was like to feel this bad and I wouldn't be scared to leave the world with fear of never feeling happiness at the same time. That's why death scares me. I'm scared I'd never feel happiness again in the afterlife or if there's even an afterlife. However, the more life kicks me in the *** the more likely I want to die and end it all. when does happiness outweigh the bad? I live for the people I care about in life... not for myself."

174328219,Studies show that clozapine is twice as effective than some other antipsychotics. It‚Äôs the best thing on the market.

175896375,"No, we don‚Äôt know each other, but it turns out we both are children of the _NAME_ empire. Incidentally I only did one year of Latin decades ago, so little chance of starting a conversation."
175896376,Apologies if this is no longer relevant but sometimes taking a ten minute break and going for a walk can do wonders. And after you are out of probation and things go south for you maybe take a leave of absence. When I worked in the call center for AT&T they would let us go for a walk after dealing with an irate customer. Obviously that privilege can‚Äôt be abused but it does help. Those are the only accommodations I can think of that would help mi.

174328217,"I do have a mental illness and as I reflect on my mindset during that evening, I couldn‚Äôt tell right from wrong. I was so completely focused on getting revenge that anything ethical was thrown out of the window. I knew that adrenaline was rushing into my brain which activated my ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù situation. And I can say positively that I was in ‚Äúfight‚Äù mode. The _USER_ID_ with schizophrenia is true. There are many news accounts of situations that did not fair well for the victims. I do not have a sound mind nor could distinguish right from wrong."
175896382,All I have to say is that there may be another reason that none of your female therapists have worked out.

175896409,My Daughter phoned up. Said did you know mummy got married last week. I knew it was on the cards. I dont know whether i should feel upset or not give a monkeys. Sometimes you just gotta let it all go. So long as little one still knows i love her dearly - i actually wish _NAME_ all the best. Ah f*ck. Im determined not to get all depressed over it. Just shows how much has changed since my Dx. I still reckon i would still be married if i was treated years sooner. No bugger would have put up with me when i was pro-dromal and then psychotic. Time to move on
175896410,Hm j didnt know it was a hallucination. good to know

When the zopiclone (Hypnotic) kicks in, my thoughts are lyrical, dreamy and then I can see really good lyrics and create them when I close my eyes. I've heard really good songs that don't exist in my dreams."

175896423,"I see a spinning image right in the middle of my line of vision but it only gets clear if i relax my vision like when you daydream. The spinning image is lines of letters arranged in a circle or snowflake like pattern. I cant read what the letters spell because its spinning too fast. If i stare at it, it gradually gets larger while spinning at the same speed. Eventually it becomes very large and becomes rainbow colored.this hallucination i only see when very tired. These hallucinations i see every day even when well rested. I look at an image like markings on a parking lot and then i continue to see them when i look away sometimes even up to five mins later. Theyre usually colored a different color than the original image. I see these colored streaks very frequently. sometimes theyre colored blotches too. or if i look at my window shades, i see the shade pattern when i blink my eyes. are these common hallucinations?"
175896424,"I had a lot of people in my help system check in on me regularly, and I really enjoyed it. After I moved to Greece, that support stopped, and I‚Äôm on my own. It‚Äôs gone well, though I‚Äôve sometimes missed being able to tell them how I‚Äôm doing. I think I was so handheld I was confused, I had so many people to turn to I didn‚Äôt know whom to turn to. If you feel 8 people checking up on you is too many, maybe you can reduce it?"
175896425,"I had a post in unusual beliefs a couple of weeks ago about it. I just believe I created the Universe and I split my consciousness up into every living being so that I wouldn‚Äôt be alone. Another variant/possibility is that nobody else is actually sentient, and I am alone."
175896426,"It‚Äôs great that they are supportive. I had some old friends who I felt looked down on me because of my mental illness. I live in another part of the country and have had to make new friends now. Out of my three best friends here, two have bipolar and one has a daughter with BPD.

I dread every meal."
175896438,"Hey all, dropping by to say hi. Sorry I‚Äôve been away, I‚Äôm recovering from flu and haven‚Äôt been feeling too well mentally.

They could call anytime now and by anytime I mean between now and next year lol, they don‚Äôt give any explanation of the maximum time that they‚Äôll contact us. I‚Äôm anxious about this but I try to distract myself. I believe if things are meant to be then the universe will conspire to help you and make things happen. Been playing Story of Season: Trio of Towns as a distraction. I hope everyone is okay."
175896439,"Some people say it does and research points that way. However, I think we‚Äôd have way more schizophrenics if it did. I‚Äôve been smoking everyday of my life since I was twelve. My symptoms go back as far as I can remember. Weed has never made me go into psychosis or worsen my symptoms at all. So really, I think it depends on the individual."

175896443,My ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù always asks me ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt you need anything else?‚Äù. This is because I have taken lorazepam from her before and she wants to sell me more. Luckily I have self discipline and don‚Äôt need lorazepam unless I‚Äôm in stressful America.

175896528,"So true, I struggle with this but my parents remind me to take my meds everynight."
175896529,There is already a topic open about it
174328264,"I think it‚Äôs really interesting to look at how you‚Äôve progressed over time with your symptoms. It blows my mind every day how far I‚Äôve come from my trauma. I would say I first started showing symptoms when I was 17 after my first major episode. My emotions were extreme and felt out of control and I‚Äôd have meltdowns at every little thing. I was in a lot of pain and suicidal. I had terrible anxiety both regarding my safety and just life stuff in general. I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night due to fear of bad things happening to me again. I started experiencing flashbacks. I was in a dissociative state most of the time, feeling like my head was gone or filled with cotton or like I was looking out at the world through a telescope. Derealization I think it‚Äôs called? Topics that reminded me of what happened sent me spiraling and certain phrases could send me into a panic. I tried to have a relationship but couldn‚Äôt handle the sexual aspect because of what happened to me, and went into a paranoia atta
ck or just shut down and dissociated when we tried to do stuff past a certain point. This lead to me beginning to avoid relationships, and even just friendships with guys in general. I spent ALL DAY every day thinking about what happened to me, it just keep replaying over and over in my head. When I was 19 I started getting out of body sensations after a scary event with a stranger on the street. This also made me start to fear men because I was scared history would repeat itself. When I walked by men or was on an elevator with them I‚Äôd feel like I was having a heart attack. I‚Äôd get violent intrusive thoughts of attacking them. I also finally started seeking help for my trauma when I was 19. I started out not being able to talk about what happened to me at all without spiraling into psychosis and paranoia. If I tried to talk about it in therapy I would dissociate and not be able to feel my body or hold onto any thoughts. Then I could write about it. Then I could talk about it to myself. Finally I started 
being able to talk about in therapy, albeit every time I did it resulted in explosive meltdowns and week long episodes of psychosis or depression. Then over time the response to talking about it became less and less extreme. By the time I was 21 I could now talk about what happened to me. My old triggers no longer set me off. I rarely if ever got flashbacks anymore. Sometimes my trauma popped up in my thoughts but it was only occasional and not constant and consuming anymore. Then I moved back to my old hometown where the trauma happened and I had a major setback and had to go back to trauma therapy. It took me a good year to restabilize and get back to where I was. And now I‚Äôm good again. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in my body. My anxiety has improved tremendously and I would say is at normal levels. I am in a healthy and loving relationship because I finally took the chance to put myself out there. Everything is so, so much better than it was. And do i still have setba
cks sometimes? Yeah, every summer, which is when I had my first episode that caused the PTSD, it flares up again. But I know now that it‚Äôs only temporary, and I have coping skills. It took a huge amount of work to get to where I am now. Weekly therapy, sometimes even twice a week when I needed it. Tons of journaling. Self help books. Talking to others with PTSD. Educating myself on it and learning about the latest treatments and doing my best to participate in them. Reaching out to others. Medication for the times where all of that wasnt even enough. (I used to need to take a benzo and other sedatives every night to sleep and not suffer from horrible anxiety and flashbacks-I now only use benzos once in a blue moon and do not use any sleep aids!!) What I‚Äôm saying is if you have ptsd it can and will get better if you put in the work. And it is not pleasant. It‚Äôs horrific. It‚Äôs miserable. It‚Äôs painful. It is not a fun journey or an easy one. But it is worth it to be freed from the past and be able to l

If you‚Äôre upset that I or others are living ourselves hope filled lives and trying to be positive, I feel you need to talk to your therapist about coping mechanisms and maybe be less unproductive."

175896552,"Well did he take into account that humans are animals??? More complex animals with more intricate systems involved. But if animals are machines then I believe humans are too. And it takes a higher consciousness to decode that pattern, but it is there. Not saying I will ever decode the humans machine pattern. But I believe it is possible. Even plants are machines in the way they grow. A bulb in a certain environment will always produce a certain result given the necessary rain and sun. There is a reason I put this in unusual beliefs and I dont think it is worth dwelling on. But it is there. Why am I crazy for thinking life has a pattern‚Ä¶but another man is a philosopher for saying 1 aspect of life (animals) have a pattern. When in the end I can link animals to all other forms of life. Life seems really predictable. I just cant predict it. But I can see that it CAN be predictable. If one had all-star world class intuition and insights into the patterns that there are. Life is not linear. Humans are 
not linear. This is why this code is so hard to decrypt. And I can only see it in certain excited mindstates. But what im saying is it really too crazy??? Or is it just im seeing more than im supposed to??? Maybe I am crazy. But just because the evidence isn‚Äôt SMACK in front of your eyes, doesnt mean it is not there. EOM (end of message) Wait not so fast‚Ä¶I understand why this board doesnt support the supernatural. But it IS possible though??? Anything is possible??? Yes I get why you guys tell people theyre wrong/delusional. But that doesnt mean youre not wrong and delusional either. Maybe sober thinking is the real delusion. And insight is whats ‚Äúconsidered crazy‚Äù. You cant prove to me that your way is better than mine. Maybe on an individual level (your personal experience it was), but that doesnt mean it is for me.

I was off until April 2012 and have been back on them ever since. I had previously carried a diagnosis of psychotic depression, it wasn‚Äôt until January 2015 that I finally got diagnosed sza.

I was going to ship it to New _USER_ID_ but the IT lady didn‚Äôt work Thursday and Friday so I got approved to drive it there. She called me yesterday and said it‚Äôs not recognizing the hard drive and she had to call HP to get them to send a new one.

175896602,"Yeah, you‚Äôre right. I can‚Äôt solve the world‚Äôs problems, and I accept that, I do, but what I want to understand is subjective moral law. What am I meant to do in order to be a good person? And my intentions, I suppose, are not completely pure, but this is as good as it‚Äôs going to get, so where do I go from here? I‚Äôm not a great person; I know that. I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm a pretty awful person, actually, and I deserve to be in hell. I don‚Äôt hate myself, strangely enough, and it‚Äôs not like I make it a point to go around and be an ass hole to others, but I don‚Äôt make it a point to be kind, either. I just sort of move along, valuing humor over kindness, and that? It‚Äôs just kind of sickening, if I‚Äôm honest. I feel sick because I just can‚Äôt seem to do what‚Äôs right. Sometimes, it‚Äôs difficult to determine what‚Äôs right or wrong, and if those situations were the only ones in which I chose wrong, then perhaps we would be having a different conversation, perhaps I would be able to live 
with myself. But I am one who is quick to anger; at people, at God, I have rage. You could call it a fatal flaw, along with laziness, selfishness. I could do more, I should do more, but I don‚Äôt, for no reason other than ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù This happens sometimes. This feeling hits me like a ton of bricks; it feels like someone‚Äôs stabbing my soul repeatedly, harder with each blow, and nothing will make it stop."
175896603,I‚Äôve been told I often seem very serious. I don‚Äôt mean to come across that way. I think your point is very valid. I‚Äôve struggled changing how I present myself though. It‚Äôs not easy.

I‚Äôd try not to take it personally and just look at it like a boss being a boss, like the way cats are cats. They didn‚Äôt get where they are from not being somewhat conniving. All managers are thinking of themselves first and foremost mostly, some don‚Äôt but they don‚Äôt usually last long. It‚Äôs a harsh world in the work environment. But don‚Äôt let it phase you."

Forged by stars, electrical pulses and chemicals, that‚Äôs all it is. The universe creating consciousness out of itself to experience itself through itself. It must want to, and still is connected to us all. Entertaining thoughts of divinity, remembering dreams of a lost place. I partially don‚Äôt want to bother anymore.

In college around 2011, I was an atheist, had a bad trip, and started questioning reality and becoming super hyper aware of my surroundings and external world and my super self consciousness and super awareness of my environment and being sentient. Then I have memories of being legitimately ‚Äòtortured‚Äô to the point of death by some people/aliens/unknown and became a Christian. I don‚Äôt know if it was in 2011 or 2013 or whatnot but I converted in 2017 and feel better now. I think I was brainwashed and forced into it. Even the computer programmers who run our reality or simulation probably did it to me. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe the true matrix/alien god‚Ä¶ my family just reinforces the christianity which is fine, I guess. I feel trapped and scared sometimes. I think aliens or somebodies put micro-chips in them.

Maybe it was just the computer simulators doing it to me or the anunnaki and other aliens. I don‚Äôt know if I was cloned in 2013 or not or taken. I have contradictory thoughts and opinions and memories too but I keep resurrecting which makes me think I am like Jesus but not Jesus and maybe just a fallen angel, Anti-Christ, false prophet, etc. I don‚Äôt know.

Male Wistar rats (180-220 g) and albino mice (25-30 g) were used for the study. The antipsychotic effect of the Ocimum sanctum was evaluated on haloperidol induced catalepsy, cooks pole climbing apparatus, locomotor activity on actophotometer, ketamine induced stereotype behavior. Different groups of rats were fed orally with a specially prepared diet containing various concentrations (2% w/w, 4% w/w and 8% w/w) of Ocimum sanctum leaves paste (OCLP) for 15 consecutive days. Further, the biochemical estimations were done by estimating brain dopamine levels. The OCLP produced significant dose dependent potentiation of haloperidol (1mg/kg, i.p.) induced catalepsy in rats, significantly increased the time taken by the rat to climb the pole in dose dependent manner, significantly decr
eased the locomotor activity. The OCLP significantly decreased ketamine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) induced stereotyped behavior in a dose dependent manner. Ocimum sanctum leaves paste (OCLP) significantly decreased the brain dopamine levels. The results suggest that OCLP posse‚Äôs antipsychotic activity. Further neurochemical investigation can explore the mechanism of action of the plant drug with respect to anti-dopaminergic functions and help to establish the plant as an antipsychotic agent."

174328290,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Nicotine consumption during the prodromal phase of schizophrenia - a review of the literature. A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment , 2019 Recent research has fueled a debate concerning the role of nicotine in the emergence of schizophrenia. The three main hypotheses are: (a) the self-medication effect, (b) the causal relationship hypothesis, or (c) the shared diathesis hypothesis. To explore this role, the study of nicotine consumption during the initial prodromal phase of schizophrenia offers important opportunities. In the present work, 10 relevant studies are reviewed, out of 727 retrieved citations, in order to address questions regarding the prevalence of smoking in the prodromal period, the time of smoking initiation, existing patterns of tobacco use in relation with the escalation of prodromal symptoms into first psychotic episode, and potential differences in symptomatology between smokers and nonsmokers. Even though there was 
considerable heterogeneity among studies, relevant findings are discussed. Prevalence of nicotine use during the prodromal period was reported to be 16.6-46%. Tobacco use was found to be taken up most often before or during the prodromal period of schizophrenia. Even though a protective role of smoking has been reported by one study, other studies report an increased risk for psychosis, with hazard ratios 2.77 (95% CI: 2.34-3.43) and 2.21 (95% CI: 1.11-4.42) for female and male heavy smokers (11-20 and >20 cigarettes/day), respectively. In a different study, the risk of onset was associated with the progressive use of cannabis and tobacco prior to onset, particularly with rapid escalation to the highest levels of use. Also, nicotine use in ultra high risk (UHR) for developing psychosis subjects is associated with elevated cognitive performance, namely better processing speed, visual learning, and spatial working memory. As a conclusion, it appears that evidence accumulates supporting a possible etiologic role 
of smoking, in the emergence of schizophrenia along with diverse effects on patients' symptomatology, already demonstrable at the prodromal phase. Future research employing better-defined criteria should further explore the patterns of use and effects of nicotine during the schizophrenia prodrome."
175896730,"Well I‚Äôve noticed that what comes in my mind by way of voices or visions I‚Äôm less likely to think or do myself. The more the voices repeat certain words, for example repeating ‚Äúdisdain‚Äù, I notice that it is harder for me to use the word ‚Äúdisdain‚Äù in thought or speech. Like the voices are marking territory in us that we should avoid. Basically the harsher your voices are on you, the less likely you would be to be harsh on yourself. The nicer the voices are to us the less nice we would be to ourselves. It‚Äôs just a theory but voices could be the brain‚Äôs way of protecting us from extremes. If they are overly nice it could be perhaps to block us from being too nice to ourselves to the point of mania or grandeur. If they are overly harsh it could be perhaps to block us from thinking too little of ourselves to the point of depression or self-harm. I hope telling you this insight does not defeat the protective mechanism"

(If so that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm used to other people thinking I am). I was seeing until recently a very good psychologist, but she went on maternity leave and it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll be able to get another therapist, so I‚Äôm stuck with my psychiatrist whose understandable fixation is with meds. About getting on with my life that‚Äôs more complicated. I‚Äôm not really fit to work (which as you know I don‚Äôt really mind), the prospect of a PhD that seemed so certain 2 years 
ago is gone, my family life has been disrupted by my separation from my wife, but I retain a good network of friends. I‚Äôve become unable and also unwilling to plan for the future, the only thing that could save me is going back to writing, but I‚Äôm not ready yet. PS. My ‚Äòsane‚Äô side suspects that the SZ diagnosis might be accurate, but that recently my OCD has made a comeback and adopted the same themes as my so-called delusions. I believe less strongly in solipsism now, for instance, but the intensity of my obsessive doubts about the shared world have increased. Sorry for the lengthy reply."

175896771,Hi! I really need a therapist right now but I can only get appointments for every other week. I just had a really good session yesterday where we discussed grounding mantras and using logic against delusions. Deep inside I really believe people are after me even though I know on some level that it‚Äôs not real. Do you think if I continue to tell myself it‚Äôs not real that someday I will actually believe that the delusion is not real?

174328307,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Basic symptoms influence real-life functioning and symptoms in individuals at high risk for psychosis. _PERSON_, _NAME_, TD _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica , Oct 2019 16 To investigate potential clinical differences in high risk profiles presenting with and without basic symptoms, and additionally investigate the association between basic symptoms and clinical symptoms, functioning, and cognition.High risk individuals (n=133) were stratified into individuals fulfilling ultra high risk (UHR) criteria (n=59) and individuals fulfilling UHR + basic symptoms criteria (BS) (n=74). Group differences were assessed on clinical symptoms, real-life functioning, and cognition. Regression analyses were conducted to elucidate on the relationship between BS and clinical symptoms, functioning, neuro- and social cognition.The group fulfilling both UHR + BS criteria had significantly more symptoms and lower real-life functioning and quality of life but not m
ore cognitive deficits. BS influenced on attenuated psychotic, depressive-, and general symptoms, but only modestly on negative symptoms. No relationship between BS and neuro- and social cognition was established except for an association with emotion recognition processing speed. BS influenced real-life functioning, and this finding was sustained when controlling for the effect of negative symptoms.Our findings indicate that BS contribute highly to the distress and symptom load of clinical high risk individuals. Longitudinal findings are needed to establish the predictive validity of BS on high-risk individuals' clinical and functional prognosis."

Neuroimaging , Sep 2019 06 Previous studies have reported that cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) improves cognitive deficits in patents with schizophrenia. However, few studies have focused on the underlying structural alterations in the brain following Vocational Cognitive Ability Training by the Japanese Cognitive Rehabilitation Program for Schizophrenia (VCAT-J). In this study, we analyzed changes in diffusion tensor imaging parameters in 31 patients with schizophrenia after 12 weeks of intervention consisting of standard treatment alone or standard treatment plus VCAT-J, in order to determine the effect of the latter on white matter microstructural plasticity. Cognitive function w
as evaluated using the Japanese version of the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS-J) scale. The CRT group exhibited significant improvements in verbal fluency and composite BACS-J scores, relative to the treatment-as-usual (TAU) group. In addition, the CRT group exhibited significantly increased fractional anisotropy (FA) values, along with significantly decreased radial (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) values, in the posterior lobe of the left cerebellum. Changes in RD and MD values were negatively correlated with changes in BACS-J composite scores. These suggest that VCAT-J might mediate improvements in myelin sheath composition in the posterior lobe of the left cerebellum, which may have been associated with improvements in cognitive function."

One neurologist said a process may be happening the other one said, fibromyalgia, another one said maybe a virus, but they all said definitely not MS. But definitely something caused a surge in the lesions. Its complicated the lot of it. Toxoplasmosis I dont know, but it could have been. When I first got sick, the neurologist prescribed topamax for daily headaches. He didn‚Äôt

Now i am working on a third show for my local area and that is the main reason i need to protect my anonymity.

He said that he completely did everything opposite of his flaws and learned 50 different skills daily for ten years and worked really hard. I haven't been using skills AT ALL when I was depressed. All I did was go deep into the suicidal realm, listen to rap, do drugs, e-*****, sleep, say ""Why me"" due to my environmental situation while on antipsychotics to kill any psychosis that was trying, as a product of what I was doing, to give me some creative way to get out of the horrible situation that I was in. Now I listen to music and do low thought stuff and then do intellectually stimulating things when I feel like that is enough (When I never did that in the past). I feel like if I knew how to deal with my lack

174328376,"The concept of recovery in mental health has been re-examined, and recent developments have revealed two non-synonymous recovery constructs: clinical recovery (objective state, i.e., symptoms, functioning) and personal recovery (subjective process, i.e., attitude or life orientation) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]. Findings from a previous study with 381 service users substantiate the importance of personal recovery, as it was found that the highest level of consensus on the definition of recovery was ‚Äúrecovery is the achievement of a personally acceptable quality of life‚Äù and ‚Äúrecovery is feeling better about yourself‚Äù [ 5 ]. Therefore, this angle of recovery may only be assessable by the individuals themselves and may approximate us to a more holistic definition of recovery. Moreover, personal recovery impacts the quality of life of individuals with schizophrenia [ 6 ], and a reduction in psychiatric symptoms alone does not necessarily translate into higher personal recovery [ 7 , 8 ].

175897124,"Hi _USER_ID_. Thanks for the post and advice. I actually already did tell my current doctor that right after she prescribed the konopin and I first tried it last November. She then told me to go to a psychiatrist, but the psychiatrist was the same way, which really shocked me...she will only give klonopin and not Xanax! It makes no sense to me at all. I thought about trying to find another psychiatrist, but most the psychiatrists around here require you to do counseling before you can see them and counseling never helped me (I've been to over 10 different therapists and none ever helped). Good advice though, thank you. Now my UC just starting flaring again and I'm back on a high dose of prednisone, which usually makes me extremely anxious and gives me insomnia so now I'm even more worried about not having much Xanax. I've basically been hoarding the 15ish pills i have left all summer and fall, lol. Obviously, I can survive without it, I just would be a lot more productive and comfortable sometimes

(I am a professional dancer and I sing in a couple of bands as well) but it would be terrifying to some. Conversely certain things that others do on a regular basis are way to uncomfortable for me to take on. So you may be more adventurous than you think...just maybe in a less conventional way than what society says! Now as far as anxiety management/recovery goes...I do think it's important to try and expand our comfort zones a bit here and there for growth.

175897259,I masturbate every one or two weeks once. Not doing it daily since years. Maybe because of health situation and being above 30 years old.
175897260,"Another time I was in bed practically the whole time. All I wanted to do was make it all go away. I just was closing my eyes and trying so hard to sleep to make the time pass until my 5150 was up but it was so noisy. There was one voice above them all. It was a delusional. He was spouting things about Jesus and aliens and conspiracy and I couldn‚Äôt tune him out. He was really triggering me. I had this really young, sweet roommate who couldn‚Äôt really talk very well, only whispers. Well this delusional keeps at it and keeps at it and pretty soon I come flying out of my bed and tell him to shut up and this little roommate of mine come up to me and I‚Äôm standing in my doorway, and he‚Äôs in the hall and she‚Äôs right beside me and she whispers ‚Äúhe touched me‚Äù and gestures to her privates, well I come totally unglued and go tearing after this guy right when this huge orderly, I kid you not 6‚Äô 5"" at least catches me and stops me dead in my tracks. I‚Äôm ranting and raving and the orderly is ju
st staring at me like I‚Äôm totally insane. It took awhile for him to get me to calm back down and go back to bed, but it did shut up the delusional for awhile. Then days later when I was getting meds I had a migraine, the worst headache I‚Äôve ever had and they wouldn‚Äôt give me anything for it so I called 911 and tried to get an ambulance to take me to the hospital. That didn‚Äôt go over very well. On the day I was leaving I was in line to get meds and that delusional came to the front on the line where I was and started talking and I pulled back my fist and said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt shut the ???? up I swear to God I‚Äôll punch you in the ??????? mouth‚Äù. Which immediately shut him up but made the meds nurse tell me that‚Äôs not the way to get to go home so I needed to be nice. Whoops. But they let me go anyway"

175897273,I recieved an initial follow up to interview with a counseling agency to freelance write about mental health for their site. They are out of Chicago. I would be getting paid initially with a per piece agreement. Then maybe long term it says.

175897277,Hang in there matey. It‚Äôs a cruel disease in itself and hope she can get some perspective with things.
174328406,I don‚Äôt think I can ask to get off the meds after what happened. I tend to have high levels of anxiety and when I got off the antipsychotic I had to go on an antidepressant that caused psychosis or brought it on made worse by withdrawals. At least Abilify is containing some of the anxiety which is odd but apparently it also works as an antidepressant.
175897278,"Even an 8 year old can follow rules. I have a young child, so I‚Äôm aware of what they can do. I also have an autistic child. It‚Äôs no excuse for rude behavior. You‚Äôre intelligent so I have higher expectations from you."
175897279,I have no respect for psychologists either.
175897280,Just looks too brutal to be helpful. I see it in old movies about mental illness and I‚Äôm like no I would never let anybody do that to me.
175897281,I still have mine from junior high in a box downstairs. Need to give them to my kid as she‚Äôs playing it now.
175897282,"At this point I‚Äôm thinking about my future and juggling the facts that with the way my health is I figure even though my life expectancy is 62 which gives me four years to live, I think that these following four years will be my last good years. I mean these following four years is probably the last years I will have energy and both good physical and mental health. So the decision that I need to ponder is this: Do I work for the next four years? Or would it be better to leave my job and enjoy my last good years? My job is great in many ways; I like my co-workers, I like my bosses, I love the company that employs me, and the work ain‚Äôt tough. I have extra benefits that I have never received at any other job. The city I work in just raised their minimum wage to $15.00 an hour. I get paid vacation, paid sick leave, they gave us some debit/ credit card to use at precipitating clinics, hospitals, drug stores to pay the cost of medication and other health related costs. So my local pharmacy accepts M
edicare but I still get charged nominal fees for the past two years but I present this card and get my meds for free. And I don‚Äôt know if this company is crazy or something but they have this benefit that they add their own money too every month which is basically a program that if I get fired or quit, they will give me this growing fund which now stands at $7000. That‚Äôs a lot of rent and food money. It gets bigger all the time and when I leave this job it‚Äôs all mine. But the reality is that I don‚Äôt like the idea of spending my last 4 good years working at a job that is not glorious or high status and then I die. I am seriously considering quitting and doing something else with my life besides toiling at a job with no chance of promotion. And then after 4 years I retire and I probably will start declining physically. My own personal trend seems to be that my mental health will get better in some ways and worse in other ways as I age. So that‚Äôs the dilemma. I‚Äôm going to talk it over with my sisters
. I‚Äôm self sufficient and not a burden but they still help me in many ways. The question is: can I survive on SSDI alone without working?"

Doctors say I‚Äôm ‚Äújust in that darn less than 1% group who cannot tolerate these medications‚Äù. So, I live with symptoms presenting nearly around the clock. Klonopin helps immensely but that is all. I‚Äôve had 15 years of psychotherapy by the best of the best in South Florida and Boston. I‚Äôm so fortunate yet I‚Äôm so cursed.

174328417,"Antipsychotics do more than lower Histamine levels they also change dopamine levels in the brain. I use Abilify and it works well for me. Also if you really want to go off your standard meds which I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you may want to try some lithium but not long term just to up your lithium stores, as lithium helps to produce serotonin which in turn can lower dopamine levels a little. Best of luck."

174328421,"I know how you feel. Best thing to do is change medication. You could try abilify, it‚Äôs got side effects but there lighter than other medications. The doctors have a lot of power so you just have to work with them. Sadly I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll let you off medication, unless you can prove your stable, which is hard.

174328430,"This meditation technique helps almost always. Close your eyes and try to see all the muscle tensions in your body that deprive you of a comfortable state. Pay special attention to the muscles of the face and head. And then, not paying attention to these muscle tensions, you should try to achieve a comfortable state. You can get comfortable condition with a lot of muscle tension. People often do not notice this strong muscle tension and unconsciously support it. This tension may be so strong that your efforts will not be enough to remove it. But your efforts should be directed not to maintain tensions but to remove them. To do this, you only need to focus on the state of internal comfort. If you notice that the internal tension as it pulls attention to yourself, try to focus attention on this place, and then as if to get out from under this concentration of attention. This can be called the technique of scattered attention. Then this thing can happen - you concentrate on some place, you can relax t
he muscles, but the tension has changed the configuration and went to another place. You track tensions again and you leave from it again and it goes to another place again. So you can meditate as much as you want. If you succeed, then there is a certain pleasure in it. It is better to do it at night, but you can do it at any time. You can anywhere at least for a moment to close your eyes and instantly disconnect. In depression, do not orient on the emotional color of the feeling, but only on its strength. Well, that is the reason for depression can be anything and feelings can be different. But the feelings should be ignored as if they were not. Sorry for my English."

Epigenetic profiles can be derived from blood cells, but to our knowledge, it is unknown whether these predict established brain alterations associated with schizophrenia.To identify an epigenetic signature (quantified as polymethylation score [PMS]) of schizophrenia using machine learning applied to genome-wide blood DNA-methylation data; evaluate whether differences in blood-derived PMS are mirrored in data from postmortem brain samples; test whether the PMS is associated with alterations of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex hippocampal (DLPFC-HC) connectivity during working memory 
in healthy controls (HC); explore the association between interactions between polygenic and epigenetic risk with DLPFC-HC connectivity; and test the specificity of the signature compared with other serious psychiatric disorders.In this case-control study conducted from 2008 to 2018 in sites in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, blood DNA-methylation data from 2230 whole-blood samples from 6 independent cohorts comprising HC (1238 [55.5%]) and participants with schizophrenia (803 [36.0%]), bipolar disorder (39 [1.7%]), major depressive disorder 35 [1.6%]), and autism (27 [1.2%]), and first-degree relatives of all patient groups (88 [3.9%]) were analyzed. DNA-methylation data were further explored from 244 postmortem DLPFC samples from 136 HC and 108 patients with schizophrenia. Neuroimaging and genome-wide association data were available for 393 HC. The latter data was used to calculate a polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia. The data were analyzed in 2019.The accuracy of s
chizophrenia control classification based on machine learning using epigenetic data; association of schizophrenia PMS scores with DLPFC-HC connectivity; and association of the interaction between PRS and PMS with DLPFC-HC connectivity.This study included 7488 participants (4395 men [58.7%]), of whom 3158 (2230 men [70.6%]) received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The PMS signature was associated with schizophrenia across 3 independent data sets (area under the curve [AUC] from 0.69 to 0.78; P value from 0.049 to 1.24?√ó?10-7) and data from postmortem DLPFC samples (AUC?=?0.63; P?=?1.42?√ó?10-4), but not with major depressive disorder (AUC?=?0.51; P?=?.16), autism (AUC?=?0.53; P?=?.66), or bipolar disorder (AUC?=?0.58; P?=?.21). Pathways contributing most to the classification included synaptic processes. Healthy controls with schizophrenia-like PMS showed significantly altered DLPFC-HC connectivity (validation methylation/magnetic resonance imaging, t??.19).We identified a reproducible blood DNA-methylation sig
nature specific for schizophrenia that was correlated with altered functional DLPFC-HC coupling during working memory and mapped to methylation differences found in DLPFC postmortem samples. This indicates a possible epigenetic contribution to a schizophrenia intermediate phenotype and suggests that PMS could be of interest to be studied in the context of multimodal biomarkers for disease stratification and treatment personalization. This is a very large study. The thing that struck me as most interesting about it was that healthy controls with a schizophrenia-like polymethylation also had altered connectivity. I don‚Äôt really know what to make of this, except to say that methylation is an epigenetic factor and changeable. Lots of things change DNA methylation including lifestyle factors like smoking and exersize, and medications and supplements can alter methylation as well. It is interesting that a segment of the healthy controls were able to, well, be healthy controls, with both a schizophrenia-like DNA m
ethylation score, and similar alterations to the DLPFC connectivity. Sometimes I read this stuff and it seems like schizophrenia must be so very deep rooted in development and largely unalterable after the fact, and other times there‚Äôs papers like this, where people manage to be normal in spite of these changes that makes me think perhaps it isn‚Äôt so deep rooted after all. If only they can figure out what makes the healthy controls healthy in spite of it ‚Ä¶"

I went to my GI doc because if blood in stool and he did a sigmoidoscopy but he ended up going in further since he said I was tolerating it so well. Everything was fine there. Just hemorrhoids. But my adbominal pain hasn't gone away. I also started getting chest pain which I went to the Er for and said everything was good. I have really bad anxiety so it could have been that. So far the chest pain has gone away but now I feel different pin point pains on both side if my adbomen. Gi doc sent me to do an ultrasound. Which I got dinne on Wednesday. I dint know how im going to fo through this week without knowing the results. Everytime I feel the first pain I start thinking I gave cancer since it's in multi
ple location not just one. I did get blood test done which almost came normal except my liver ALT is high at 39. Have very low vitamin D. And HDL is low but other than that everything is ok. Has anyone experienced this kind of pain in multiple locations in the abdomen. Doc said it might be gall stones but at the time i only had pain on the upper right part. Now i gave it in both."

174328443,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Gene Chips: Applications to Neuroscience. RD Fields and _PERSON_, The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry , Oct 2000 A convergence between molecular biological technique and the technology of miniaturization has produced the ""gene chip"" or microhybridization array. This device multiplies by several thousand fold the power of the northern blot for studying gene expression. Now, it is possible to survey simultaneously a large fraction of all genes in an experimental organism, and within a few years all of the approximately 140,000 human genes will be within reach of the technique. This capability is not only accelerating the rate of research into gene expression and function, it is changing the perspective of inquiry from single genes in isolation to networks of genes operating as a system. Many neurological diseases, from hydrocephalus to schizophrenia, have a genetic component, and individual responses to therapeutic drugs can vary wi
th the genetic background of patients. In neurology and neurobiology, the ability to obtain ""gene expression profiles"" from nervous tissue promises to illuminate interactions between neuronal genes and the environment, development, disease, aging, and response to drugs and injury."

175897465,"I don't know how to really share or ask a question without sharing the whole story because I don't know IF I'm going to get the answer I'm looking for. Basically, my life fell apart in 2016 and ever since then I've been going through the chaos of everything - I lost my job - I struggled to keep jobs (either because of the anxiety I felt at those jobs, or they were jobs that I wasn't use to and I just didn't fit) - I lost my home - my car - friends - And now it feels like I""m losing the support of my ""Close Friends"" and ""Family"" - I had to basically move in with my parents and try to save up some money, but unfortunately things didn't go the way they were planned, because I never was able to keep a job long enough to save any money. I tried to find the ""emotional support"" in my friends, but they seem absent and un-supportive. I know I can't force anyone to be there for me, but sometimes I just ""want them"" to be there for me and when it doesn't happen it makes me quite sad. I never thought t
hat I was codependent, but I can see more and more when my friends aren't there for me that maybe I am and that's why things feel so dark and crazy. What really sparked a major anxiety moment was the other day my sister in law texted me and wanted to help with me finding out why I wasn't able to get a job or keep a job. She made me feel like I could open up with her and discuss things, but after a few hours of going back and forth things got dark and hateful - She basically was making me feel like I was a ""burden"" to my parents and that I needed to stop being selfish and grow up - She didn't bother to hear my situation or why I have been struggling with stuff - she just wanted to look at the ""surface of problem"" and not even consider what I've been going through. I know that my parents don't deserve me living with them - I know that I need to find a job - I know that I want my independence - You see, I don't have a problem recognizing the situation and knowing that I need to fix things - BUT maybe what I 
need is to feel that I'm not going crazy and that I do deserve to have some kind of support in my life. I guess it goes back to my question - Why does it feel like NO ONE CARES? It felt like my friends would show their support when I was at their house, but once I was back home it was like weeks went by and the months went by and there was never a text message or email or phone call or anything to see what was going on - and then even my family that showed some interest by texting me, and then to basically use my situation and my past to KICK ME when I was down."

One of my long time friends has visions but she also has guides, she‚Äôs the one who taught me about shamanism originally, which was a major focus of my psychosis. I thought I was being trained by a peacock shaman. I later learned the basic principles...sometimes I use it when I‚Äôve reached the limits of what I can do. Like if someone is sick to offer them a healing. I find that if I give my mind a positive outlet like healing or shamanism I don‚Äôt get the negative stuff going. Shamanism is kind of unique in that all the levels of the world are fairly neutral there‚Äôs no heaven/hell dichotomy so you‚Äôre just dealing with animal spirts and it‚Äôs not a religion per se. Anyway you tend to have guides with most of this stuff and they keep you safe and advise you. Sometimes getting more info and structure helps. Like have you read books on being psychic because there tend to be shared elements to the visions e

175897486,I‚Äôve had responses that were not at all ‚Äòright‚Äô but the feeling underneath of getting angry itself is not ‚Äòwrong‚Äô.

175897669,"_AT_MENTION_ - Can I ask what resolved your anxiety and depression? Was it the drugs, therapy, both, or something else? I'm only asking because this bupropion I'm taking is not doing a single thing for me. Monday will make two weeks since I've been taking 150mg daily. Monday is also my appointment with my doc and I was planning on bringing my remaining bupropion and trazodone for proper disposal. I am hoping they can prescribe something else to replace the bupropion and I'll ask about the doxepin for insomnia. I was prescribed doxepin for a while about a year ago and it did work well for a while. But because the anxiety / depression was not being treated, I guess the doxepin became less effective over time and I stopped taking it after six months. But if I can get rid of this depression / anxiety, I'm hoping that would mean I could get off of any drugs. _NAME_ - Colorado Springs, CO"

175897687,"That you would go to sleep, and just never wake up? I‚Äôve been awake for quite some time now and I did a little research about the matter. I found out that Queen _NAME_ I, also stayed up for hours, feeling that pull of death everyone has at some point in their lives. You know, that premonition feeling? She actually stayed up for 15 hours, because she knew after she‚Äôd fall asleep, she‚Äôd never wake. I just fear that I can suddenly lose my life. I hardly reflect on this sort of stuff so that I can embrace the life I have. But I‚Äôm suddenly more ‚Äúaware‚Äù of the prospects of death. I‚Äôm not afraid of death. I know I‚Äôll be leaving everything in order, when the time comes. But it‚Äôs leaving my family that I can‚Äôt shake. Do these thoughts and feeling mean, I need to spend more time with my family? Cause we haven‚Äôt lately. I don‚Äôt know just can‚Äôt rest for such thoughts."

174328508,I told all my friends that I have SZ when I was on Abilify. That didn‚Äôt change anything. One of them has social anxiety disorder and is taking antidepressants.

175897708,"Cbd in really high doses, like 100 mg, makes me feel high. I usually only take 10mg twice a day, but if I have a bad night of sleep or a migraine, I take extra.

I haven‚Äôt had psychosis in over 3 years, so I cant say what effect the CBD has on that since I‚Äôve only taken it for 6 months. But it does wonders for my insomnia."

175897712,"I did it while I was addicted to crack. My opinion may be innapropriate but I kind of feel the way another poster stated it a month or two ago when the subject of sex and strippers was brought up. Quote: ‚ÄúI would rather have some kind of memories when I get old than none at all.‚Äù Some places in the world have viewpoints that going to prostitutes or hiring escorts is perfectly fine and normal. At age 58 I have little chance with women so why deny myself the pleasure just because I live in the wrong country? I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm going to hire an escort but it‚Äôs nice to know they‚Äôre there if I ever wanted one. In high school and well into my twenties the common opinion about prostitutes was that it was derided and only showed that you can‚Äôt get sex for free so it was looked down on. Well, circumstances change."
175897713,what religion did you change to? if i may ask?
175897714,i don‚Äôt know that. you should ask your pdoc if you think your dx is wrong‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard for us to say if that is the case or not‚Ä¶
175897715,"It‚Äôs a hit and miss. Potential drugs can be chosen for further research based on their receptor affinities, but we don‚Äôt know for sure why some drugs work better than others, and they weren‚Äôt engineered to work well by targeting specific receptors. Seroquel is one drug that seems to work partly through its effects on serotonin. Serotonin affects dopamine transmission. But we don‚Äôt know specifically why or how it works. In the end, the effects are probably not because of regulating levels of neurotransmitters, but because of other effects on these brain networks that we‚Äôre only just beginning to understand, such as reorganizing connectivity patterns and changing genetic expressions inside brain cells."
175897716,"I felt my blood pressure is high,is it related to weight gain and stress caused by my antipsychotic pills?"
174328509,"I‚Äôm on rexulti, I wonder if that is why."
175897717,"Glad you‚Äôre still in one piece. I had an OK day, but pretty ambivalent. I‚Äôm doing some treatment thing and it‚Äôs healing me slowly. Just have to figure out how to spend the time while it works."

Medication and CBT have always been the heavy hitters in that department. The only massive change to all this came lately with Amyloban 3399. It seems to boost the effectiveness of my APs to the point where I‚Äôm doing well on what is almost a maintenance dose (can‚Äôt go off it tho as I crash hard and fast now)."

Then, you can consider this: And if that isn‚Äôt enough, try this: This actually can heal the physiological damage causing your issues. Lots of testimonials and studies about how it is good for mental illness. But I feel like I am plateauing a bit on the Daily Essential Nutrients. I‚Äôm trying something called PEMF after.

175897776,I don‚Äôt really care what happens after death. I hope I can be a crow. I like crows. Crow fam would be sweet. I used to imagine my death a lot when I was having suicidal thoughts. Id think of how fun it would be to jump off the highest building or highest crane tower or highest cliff and just fly to my death. But then I‚Äôd think of what a mess that would be for people to clean up and that would lead me away from those ideas. I used to try to tell myself to not do it because of fam members or friends but that was wearing thin too. Then my mental health started to get better with a lot of hard work and treatment changes. Now I value my life more even if it is to just experience it for good or bad. I still wanna be a crow
175897777,I would go to an emergency room and they have inpatient stay for a while and get you help and support Be tough and positive tell yourself you‚Äôre going to get through this! Call a nurse or your pdoc
175897778,"It can take awhile. Anywhere from 2-12 weeks and then you titrations up in doses because you start out low. Each dose change you give about 2-3 months until you‚Äôve hit the maximum and if that doesn‚Äôt work you get the fun game of starting all the way over with the next drug. There is no such thing as a drug without side effects, you just don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll get any or which ones you may get. The problem with mental illness patients is that sometimes they make the mistake of reading the side effects and put it in their heads that they have it. Just know that side effects especially nausea, diarrhea and fatigue usually subside within 1-2 weeks. Some people feel that if they get any side effects it‚Äôs forever or that the drug isn‚Äôt right for them. Then you have to make sure you‚Äôre not looking for side effects or looking to see if someone is talking about you etc because you will then believe it‚Äôs happening even if it isn‚Äôt. The best thing to do is not even read the side effects if you 
know that you have the personality to dwell on them. That‚Äôs not to say you don‚Äôt need to be aware of any potential drug to drug interactions or anything that you need to get blood work done for to check your blood, kidney or liver counts. Your doctor will let you know if you‚Äôre on something that calls for random bloodwork. Any anything prescription wise will be automatically flagged in your pharmacy‚Äôs computer if they have major drug to drug interactions, but supplements and herbs not prescribed by your doctor are actually best checked with your pharmacist rather than your doctor because they have a better computer program for all interactions. I hope this helps."

As it was just the ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù stage, it was not the symptom but the side effect (that matters to me now). When I fisrt began to take the medications, I was just 150 lb, but now I gained more than 35 lb for about last decade. I am 68 inches tall(172cm), I am on 10 mg abilify. Meanwhile, my doctor always says that abilify is weight-neutral so it wouldn‚Äôt be abilify(that affects or has been affecting my weight). Plus, he would say that the statistics proves its neutrality. However, I see so many cases online that may indicate that it is not sometimes weight-neutral. Anyway, I told my doctor that I wanted to change the medications and actually I started to take 5 mg on abilify and an amount of Lonasen, which is known in my country to reduce weight as a side effect. ( I actually forgot what amount on Lonasen I had taken, but doctor said it is consistent with the 5 m
g on abilify.) It seemed everything was going well, but 2 weeks after then, I started to be very sensitive and negative. So, I got back to 10 mg pure Abilify medications‚Ä¶ In addition, I am diagnosed of prediabetes maybe because of the abdominal obesity I have gained for last several years. Finally, I decided to excercise three to four times more than before cause it would be possibly my last option , but many say online that it seems very hard to lose one‚Äôs weight on abilify even with hard excercise.

It wasn‚Äôt until after I cut out lactose (dairy) that it FINALLY started to soften and shrink. Could be a food intolerance. Also, if you got the gut because you craved sugar and carbs on your meds (like me) there‚Äôs a good chance that your gut bacteria are out of whack. Probiotics help too."

Someone i know loves zyprexa, because it makes him really calm and sleepy before bed. He actually looks forward to taking it. I didnt like it. The first weeks i had nightmares and fears and fainted all the time. After that it worked very well against anxiety and delusions.

174328583,"Infinite amount of suffering. No one person can comprehend what I‚Äôve been through not even a mentally ill person. What I feel and think is real to me. I don‚Äôt have proof but I think there is a ton of evidence. I just don‚Äôt know about it or have it. I pray to God I will be released from this mental prison. My story is old and I repeat myself too often. It‚Äôs no point here anymore. It‚Äôs like the game is rigged to ignore me, which might be a silver lining. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what truly happened to me 9 years ago. I will never know despite my best effort. I can at least narrow it down. In the end, does it truly matter ‚Äì at all? From what I am experiencing, I hope no one has to. I am an unique person. The worst thing for me is to experience an eternity with psychosis, being unable to work and function, and then experiencing a million different other realities a heck worse than this one. I cannot remember what it‚Äôs like to not be schizophrenic despite it being 9 years ago. If this is a 
computer simulation, then I‚Äôve been to hundreds of other computer simulations just to watch them get destroyed afterwards. In my other lives, it often felt like I was Jesus Christ being crucified by the _NAME_ Empire. I sometimes felt I was _NAME_ the Baptist too. Not literally, but figuratively in the amount of suffering I experienced. I hope this simulation is safe and that I live a good, long life and then escape the Matrix or at least experience a non-schizophrenic life. I took the bait once and allowed the people to put me in a simulation so I could, hypothetically, be cured of schizophrenia, which was not only a huge mistake on my part (trust), but never worked out. It‚Äôs impossible for my schizophrenia to be completely cured. If it was possible, then I wouldn‚Äôt have it. If I‚Äôm truly a test tube baby like they said I was, why give me the propensity or ability to get psychosis? It‚Äôs ?????? up! I‚Äôve been outside the matrix and even helped run it. I would trade places with _PERSON_ any day. What
‚Äôs outside the simulation? Another reality or earth like this one. I‚Äôve often felt I lived through the Tribulations countless times. That‚Äôs why I became a believer.

175898032,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [Evidence that suggest the reality of reincarnation]. _PERSON_, Investigacion clinica , Jun 2015 Worldwide, children can be found who reported that they have memories of a previous life. More than 2,500 cases have been studied and their specifications have been published and preserved in the archives of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of _NAME_ (United States). Many of those children come from countries where the majority of the inhabitants believe in reincarnation, but others come from countries with different cultures and religions that reject it. In many cases, the revelations of the children have been verified and have corresponded to a particular individual, already dead. A good number of these children have marks and birth defects corresponding to wounds on the body of his previous personality. Many have behaviors related to their claims to their former life: phobias, philias, and attachments. Others seem to recognize people and places of his supposed pre
vious life, and some of their assertions have been made under controlled conditions. The hypothesis of reincarnation is controversial. We can never say that it does not occur, or will obtain conclusive evidence that it happens. The cases that have been described so far, isolated or combined, do not provide irrefutable proof of reincarnation, but they supply evidence that suggest its reality."

What I say about myself have social consequences. If I say something to his friends, or if I act certain way, it will be read as a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù action and his friends would leave. Right now, my brother does not know that I have schizophrenia. My mother and father are too ashamed to tell my brother that I have schizophrenia. I‚Äôm worried about my brother‚Äôs social status because I have schizophrenia and physical disability. What about his future wife? Will she still stay with him when he finds out that I have two disabilities? What about his future career? Would the public still accept him when they find out that I have disabilities (note: He wants to be a classical musician)? What about his job? Will he have friends? Will he be able to date and will his girlfriend leave him if she finds out that I have a disability? I seriously feel like a 
nuisance. I feel like a shame. My mom told me to never talk about it (including my physical disability) because it‚Äôs shameful and it will destroy our family‚Äôs lives if I tell others. I remember that my brother yelled at me when my physical illness almost destroyed me. He also couldn‚Äôt tell his friends that I was using a mobility aid because it made him feel ashamed. I hate it. I hate that I have disabilities. I hate myself and I hate what I am, and who I am. I‚Äôm sorry, brother. You don‚Äôt need to have me on this Earth. Life would be easier to live without me."
175898042,"Really, nothing. But if you want to practice avoiding looking at harmful materials, it helps to research the exploitation that goes on behind the scenes of pornography. My oldest child, who I started fostering at 19, used to do sex work before they came to live with me. They had been forced into sex work since age 5. They didn‚Äôt start making videos online until they were 18, but they absolutely hated it and cried every night after making one. They just didn‚Äôt know any other way to earn money. I have found that this is the norm, rather than the exception, when it comes to pornography actors. They are very frequently sexually abused children who just aged out of one form of exploitation and into another. That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt porn actors who genuinely enjoy their work. But even so, it is a very risky field to be in and frequently causes significant harm to the body, mental health, and social standing. After I got my oldest child, I stopped watching porn entirely. For one thing, I was 
afraid I might accidentally stumble across a video they made. For another, it was impossible to look at any pornstar and not see their terrified face as they cried every night before they finally got the courage to leave the industry. Now, when I want to fantasize, I use written erotica and my imagination. I have a much more enjoyable experience than I ever did with video porn, because I can find things more suited to my specific tastes. I also find partnered sex to be more enjoyable, because my brain is more used to being in sexy thoughts mode, rather than being spoon-fed stimulating content."

174328595,"I don‚Äôt know. Probably a combination of things. For me, I think it was aliens, shadow government/Illuminati. I initially had schizophrenia in high school (parallel universe/past life) and changed it by avoiding pot smoking via _NAME_/good choices and quantum outcomes. The aliens told me they delayed my schizophrenia and wanted me to try college or something. I don‚Äôt know a lot about my family but I just know I‚Äôve been through some weird ????. I designed/created a time machine in a past life and I was tormented by various aliens. I think a cure is possible ‚Äì on the horizon. But for me, I have to work hard and think for myself. I think alzheimers cure will be developed first. I don‚Äôt consider myself a normie though. I‚Äôm different/special. If I got the norovirus in 5th grade, it doesn‚Äôt make much sense because it should have been in the womb or younger. I had bad ear infections and eczema as a baby mainly.

175898086,This is one subject I always feel some want to retract from because I‚Äôm afraid people will think I‚Äôm promoting something bad. I‚Äôve found writing dialogues or imagining dialogues between two characters helps me to reveal some underlying thought to find resolve. Lots of dialogues I‚Äôve imagined are so dark though I‚Äôm afraid to share them at all. Reminds me of something I only felt comfortable to say on my brothers account about what I think a serial killer would say on death row because the ones in the video were pretty tame compared to what I thought. ‚ÄúI am a reflection of everything you pretend not to be.‚Äù. It got quite a lot of likes and praise for being deep. I was shocked. In general our society does not condone owning darkness because we think it‚Äôs purely evil and should be denied.

In my opinion, I'd rather take 100 Sertraline a day instead of having one Xanax :D strange, right? I find benzodiazepines very much addictive and it's a short term solution. I was against medication before I got panic disorder but then when I asked the same questions you asked to the psychiatrist dr I worked with they said ""Well wouldn't it be stupid trying to treat depression patients with medicines which cause depression?

However, there is no doubt (in my mind at least) that I‚Äôve been set aside, so to speak, by my family. My experiences never add up to any significance in light of what they‚Äôve experienced.

Sure, they might not be mentally ill, but their physical state has worsened so far enough to cause psychosis. You were wanting to kill people, right? The reason why you thought that is because your brain wasn‚Äôt working well. Psychosis originates from the brain. Brain is an organ, and brains get sick too just like any other organ. Right now, your brain is not well and that‚Äôs why you are having symptoms. ‚ÄúHealthy people‚Äù can be defined in various ways. I have muscular dystrophy and happens to be mentally ill. However, there are TONS of people with muscular dystrophy who have organic brain diseases, especially people with duchenne muscular dystrophy. ‚ÄúHeal
thy people‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúnot mentally ill‚Äù. Health conditions sometimes affect mental state. So, psychosis is not a mental problem. It‚Äôs an organic reaction from a suffering brain. I hope this answers your question."

174328648,"Only congenital and early (i.e. first years of life) cortical blindness (i.e. blindness that is due to abnormal brain development) seems to fully protect against schizophrenia (and IIRC psychosis). Later blindness and non-cortical blindness does not protect against sz. This means the most probable explanation is that neural reorganization of the occipital lobe (visual areas), where these areas are used for other functions and which is much more effective in the first years of life, protects against sz and psychosis. Which again most likely implies that sz and psychosis is related to either a malfunction in the otherwise functional occipital lobe, which is erased following early/congenital cortical blindness, or a malfunction in nearby areas that is due to limited space - space which is provided for these areas following early/congenital cortical blindness. One theory is that the evolutionary pressure on language areas (which are right next to the visual areas) has been so great that psychotic illne
sses such as schizophrenia developed in humans as a result. When evolutionary pressures on a set of specific adaptations such as language are great, this leads to quicker evolutionary development of these adaptations coupled with a greater accumulation of maladaptive traits. These traits could be the cause of schizophrenia, and it makes sense that they are related to language areas because language is one of our main modes of thought and reasoning, and problems with cognition seem to be the most pathognomonic part of schizophrenia."

174328651,Toughluck33 I have the same feeling about it being adaptation. I‚Äôm unusually advanced at hand to hand combat as well as with weapons and my body and mind function much differently within situations where those things may be needed and I feel totally incomplete and useless in a world where they are not. I am very concerned about medication though because those I‚Äôve been placed on in the past were very debilitating and caused drastic reduction in my ability to think and reason but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs just because it removed the extraneous beliefs and delusions that allowed me to reach my determinations initially. AdmiralBarkley I don‚Äôt believe I am destabilizing in fact most of the time quite the opposite. It feels as though I am starting to really understand what is happening to me and even able to view a lot of it from a seemingly 3rd person perspective in order to make adjustments to fit in to daily life.

175898281,"From what I hear, the slower you lose weight, the more likely you‚Äôll succeed in your diet. Losing about 1 1/2‚Äì2 1/2 lbs a week are pretty good, safe, rates to lose. From my limited knowledge, 1200 calories a day is too little. When I say ‚Äúlimited knowledge‚Äù my expertise and claim to fame is reading Dr. _PERSON_ best-selling book on dieting. The diet has fallen out of favor but he had some really good scientific information about the science of dieting in his book. I lost 60 lbs on the Atkins Diet, I was on Resperidone at the time. I also tried Weight Watchers (which I didn‚Äôt like) and a little known diet similar to the Atkins Diet but less restrictive which I lost about 65 lbs. The thing about diets in general is that even so-called experts in the field of nutrition can disagree on what constitutes a good diet. In the 1970‚Äôs when I was trying to eat healthy and take care of my body, the prevailing wisdom at the time was that a diet with lots of carbohydrates was a good way to eat. Thus 
you had doctors telling you to eat lots of bread, pasta, and fruit and rice. And to count calories. And that any type of fat was bad like greasy food and the fat in crackers and cookies. Meat was also warned against. Well, years later we had nutritionists telling us to avoid carbohydrates and be careful about eating sugary fruit. And that some fat is OK. Also eating meat in moderation is OK especially fish and poultry. Atkins said counting calories is a hard way to diet. So his idea was that you could eat all the meat you want and a certain amount of vegetables and dairy. And all that protein would help you lose weight. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why is diet is not popular anymore though I still see Atkins products being sold in stores. Now I‚Äôm trying to lose weight again and I am seeing a nutritionist because my health insurance covers the whole cost. It‚Äôs hard to know how to diet with so much conflicting information. My nutritionists have just told me how to eat in a common sense way. Basically, she tells m
e, some protein is good every day. it doesn‚Äôt have to be meat, it can be eggs or beans, or milk or other sources of protein, she tells me eat plenty of vegetables and some fruit but avoid all the more sugary fruit. She says some low fat or non fat dairy is OK. A little oil is OK to cook with but specifies virgin _NAME_ oil is the best oil for you. Some carbohydrates are OK, for instance, wheat pasta or brown rice or some whole grain bread. And it‚Äôs basically everything in moderation. But me and millions of other people don‚Äôt stick to diets because we don‚Äôt want to be hungry all day. But the solution to that is healthy snacks. Fruit or yogurt or popcorn or vegatables w/dip. Low fat crackers, cheese sticks. Well, I wrote way more than I meant to. It‚Äôs just stuff I picked up over the years. There isn‚Äôt a diet in the world that is going to work for everybody. And there ain‚Äôt a diet in the world that is going to be universally liked. You just have to experiment and see what fits your lifestyle (and y
our budget of course)."

Ninety-four patients with a history of violence and 92 patients with no history of violence underwent a multidimensional baseline assessment. Aggressive behavior was monitored during a 1-year follow-up through the Modified Overt Aggression Scale. The Violent group scored significantly higher than the Control group on the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI-III) Antisocial, Sadistic, Borderline, and Paranoid personality scales. Irrespective of any history of violence, patients with PD as a primary diagnosis displaye

Furthermore, the most significant predictor of aggressive behaviors over time was endorsing a primary diagnosis of PD.

I even went to a psychatric center for an assessment. I was told it was just stress then. That before the voices started though."
175898342,"I upped my seroquel dose by myself from 200mg to 600mg which stabilised me. Then I saw my regular psychiatrist and told them I wanted to go back on abilify. I‚Äôve been on Abilify ever since, and stable. I‚Äôve never forgotten nor forgiven them."

175898346,"I‚Äôve decided. I‚Äôm going to remain on 3mg and take on a wait and see approach. First signs of mania or mixed states, ill quickly increase my dose. At some point I‚Äôll text my doctor to keep her on notice. But I see her in a week anyway. Thanks all!"

175898356,I lose the narrative in my head and it‚Äôs pretty similar to the voices but less disturbing
175898357,That‚Äôs a double negative. But I feel better because I tackled a chore I had been neglecting. I didn‚Äôt feel the pressure of my conscience bothering me but it was there.
175898358,I have decided that it is better to ask my colleagues when we next go out for drinks which might be a few weeks. Everybody on this planet is totally psychotic about sex. Sex on this planet is 100% fake and acted. Let‚Äôs be clear- The missionary position is 100% fake always and can NEVER be successful for anyone Shouting in pulses is FAKE Women CAN‚ÄôT do the things they are meant to be able to do. The idea in this thread is important for Earth because it is the nuclear option to bring everybody out of psychosis when they go on the chatroom. Working in millions on the chatroom is the sane way of doing things for Earth. I can‚Äôt just phone my media friend because this is my method of getting around the unpredictability of the psychosis ‚Äì advice would be appreciated. If someone wants to phone the police then they can ask the police to phone a news channel to do this idea. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time. Women- is the fake sex agenda a good deal for you all things considered?

175898461,"_PERSON_ has very good points. In addition, I found that writing down lists helps get things done. But don‚Äôt make it so long you lose hope. Maybe start out with 3-5 things you need to do for the next day and write them down. The next morning, check out your to-do list and make a goal to have all checked off (or most) before a certain time that day. Make your to-do list out the night before. You will find you waste less time and accomplish more. I felt the way you do now. I had to start making to-do lists to force myself to get things done. It felt good at the end of the week to look back in my spiral notebook at the previous dates and see what I had accomplished. I also have a racing mind. I‚Äôve started yoga which actually is helpful.

175898518,"Were you diagnosed with RAD? Unlike BPD traits of emotionalism, attention seeking for comfort and self-destruction, a RAD kid will lack affect, experience anhedonia, will not seek or respond to comfort, and instead of self-harming, they're more likely to destruct property, hurt other people and animals. Research shows almost all RAD kids have Callous-Unemotional Traits and almost three quarters get diagnosed with (usually early onset) Conduct Disorders. If they do progress into a Cluster B personality disorder once an adult, it will be Antisocial PD. They can be quite underestimated. A child with severe RAD, could murder their entire family without blinking an eye. It's very sad. I don't like that their entire future is often ripped away from them when they were just children at the hands of adults who were supposed to care for them or intervene and help. They lack affect and many treatment approaches are based on things like forming attachments and ""conscience development"" - and interventions ar
e similar to children who present as psychopathic. Bowbly, who formalized attachment theory, wrote that in worst case scenarios, injured attachments can create ""the loveless psychopath"" - which is interesting to contemplate because severe neglect in one's early years can interfere with brain development and cause developmental disorders (among other things). RAD might make a little bit of sense for Schizoid PD, but I would say disorganized-disoriented attachment style would be the closest connector. Same with dissociative disorders including DID (same with complex ptsd). Possibility extreme avoidant attachment style as well for SPD. Attachment disorders and disorganized-disoriented style often overlap with each other along with complex ptsd. I have all 3. The behavior that comes with disorganized-disoriented style is almost comical at times. I also have a low grade attachment disorder (the part of I do not normally seek comfort nor do I normally respond to it and forming any real degree of attachment is clo
se to impossible) + I have cptsd. If cptsd in an individual progresses into a PD, it would most likely be Borderline PD, but depending on traits developed in response to the chronic and ongoing trauma one experiences, it could also progress into NPD, SPD, AsPD, etc. Additionally, the BPD traits of fear of being alone, clinginess, fear of abandonment and lashing out at the people who have made them feel those things, acting out to recieve comfort when distressed would most likely connect to extreme ambivalent attachment style."

As a nurse, I can say that your liver and kidneys are responsible for detoxification of your body, and they do a damn good job it. Nothing wrong with taking steps to look after those organs, such as cutting down on alcohol intake for example. However, most supplements are a complete waste of your money and can interact with normal medications. If you want to make sure your getting all your vitamins and minerals, get you doctor to do a blood test. You‚Äôll know for sure what you need to supplement your diet. Supplementation is not regulated like regular medicines. I can give an easy example. You will likely find a bottle of Chlorophyl in the supplements section of you chemist. People pay top dollar for it. But unless you have chloroplasts like a plant, you can‚Äôt process it. Please be careful - your choice of course, but please look after yourself."

Public safety personnel tend to stay put in the same place long-term, so they build a family type working environment.

175898631,"_PERSON_, Great job on getting the help that you need with your medication start up and continuing to get out and exercise when you can... ...as well as the lifestyle changes that you are starting to consider. If you feel that getting back to work will help you with your anxiety management, then that is the wise choice for you to make. Try not to let feelings of guilt add your stress. Ten months is good amount of time to dedicate to being your son's sole caregiver. (much longer than many can or do) It is important for you to take care of yourself, so that you can be the best mom possible. The carer has to first care for herself before she can do the best for those she cares for. The medication that you are taking, as _PERSON_ said is not addictive. Some mistakenly think so since it needs to be taken daily and must be weaned off of, but this is simply to improve performance and to avoid side effects of discontinuation. It may take some time to start to feel the benefit of you new medication. This is 
expected, and sometimes it seems the challenges can become worse before things get better, but this is temporary and usually results is an Rx that is a very helpful tool....so hang in there and don't get discouraged! We are here to cheer you on, so please keep us updated on your progress! S.C."

He took me to a neighbors house and she took care of me until mom came home from the bar at 7pm she took me to a medical clinic and was livid because she had a date at 9, we got home about 945pm that night she put me in bed shut the door and told the babysitter to watch my brother and not to open the door or do anything for me, i cried for hours it hurt so bad."

I try not to let her get to me anymore, but that doesn't work all the time. I think she means well when she offers her opinion, but boy-oh-boy do I feel hopeless afterwards."" This is an important observation. Would you consider not sharing your dreams and goals with your grandmother? Perhaps don't mention them. If she asks, change the topic to something less deep/important. if she pushes, just calmly say something like ""I'm not going to discuss that."" And then move on to something else. She's unlikely to change, right? So maybe you can change how you interact with her? She likely does mean well but this interaction is hurting you and you've had enough hurt I'm sure. Maybe give a new approach a try. It sounds like you have other people in your life who share your optimism. Maybe you can keep your dreams and goals nice and safe and only share with thos
e folks....like precious secrets you want to protect? I'm trying to learn to think of failure in terms of I just learned what not to do...I didn't fail. Another idea for you. What if instead of thinking of failure, you think of disappointments? As in 'I tried that and it didn't work out and I am disappointed. And that's okay. The disappointment will fade.' I'm working on believing that I DO have value. This is excellent! You are working on it therefore you are farther along toward happiness than you may even realize Do you say it aloud to yourself? Try that. Each day somewhere safe, in a strong loud voice 'I am a valuable being in the Universe. I deserve to be happy and well. I am happy and well. My future is bright!' Mind, body, and spirit respond to messages like that. They also respond to the reverse....the negative messages of depression but then you already know that Keep going!

And he also says we should stay on one combination for a while before making changes. Yet he wants to make these changes again. Maybe I'm misperceiving what he's saying. But I think he is always anxious to make a change. I've always understood that Abilify is good for my mood and olanzapine is good for my psychosis. Any other combination than that has seemed to mess things up. I thought my pdoc understood this, but he seems to have forgotten or something. I just have to remind him, I guess."

175898744,I‚Äôve lost about 8 pounds. I‚Äôm losing 2 pounds a week. I would like to be losing double that. But at least I‚Äôm not gaining anymore. So I guess it‚Äôs working. I‚Äôm still hungry a lot but I can control myself most of the time. I keep it to 1200 calories a day usually.
175898745,Well someone close to me died. I believe they were trying to contact me from the other side. I saw signs that they were right there. So I guess I have to believe in life after death. This all happened before schiz. Do you think I‚Äôm nuts anyway for believing this?

175898751,"Yes I get loads of that. It‚Äôs hard not to. I am still functional with sz but much less than pre-illness. My job is stressful. My sleep rarely restful. I can‚Äôt quit smoking. Etc. But if I focus on the positives it gets better. I am in reasonable physical health. My family is doing ok. I have a job and live independently. I have reliable friends. I am still young enough to hope for things to get even better. Maybe a medicine tweak or a few changes here and there, I might have more energy. Oh and I still believe in a higher power. Helps a lot when feelings tend to go south."

Now it‚Äôs starting to come naturally. Thank goodness for my friend. I have gained cognitive definition through socialization. But I see these 18-20 year olds it comes so naturally and easy to them. And I remember being that way too. I mean it was hard because I was schizoaffective and off meds at the time, but the thought of dropping out of school was like such a failed situation!!!

175898755,When I exercise I feel like I‚Äôm dying and I get overheated and headache afterwards I think its because of the meds
174328756,"I started my kid on L-Theanine today, he has what they are calling ASD, said its basically adhd but with some slight sensory issues. I got this as i saw a kids version, 50mg during day then 50mg later on that evening, alot of the reviews say they help with the anxiety induced outbursts their kids had and they seem more focused and follow tasks easier etc. Don‚Äôt know if it works as its only day one, and I only have him 4 days one week 3 days the next, spends 50/50 between me and his mums. They did prescribe melatonin for to give him at night as he wasn‚Äôt producing enough melatonin naturally. However he heard his mum talking about putting it in his drinks at night on the phone and now refuses to drink anything at night, now i see you mention that this may help with sleep i might keep one for late at night and give him that as he loves these, orange flavoured chewables. He wasn‚Äôt in the best of moods to start with today, as his mum has another new boyfriend, wanted him asleep early so stuck two 
of the melatonin instead of one in hot chocolate which he did drink, but she heard them talking when smoking out the back and going in and out the house, woke at 1am went down stairs to see what all the noise was and then was up all night and hadnt slept since then until about 11pm tonight, so its hard to gauge if the L-theanine is helping as he was grumpy and in a bad mood because i wouldnt let him sleep in the afternoon. The only other issue is, he will only be getting them when hes with me, im scared if i i give them to his mum she will give him too much to try and calm him down like she did with the melatonin tabs. He will get a good sleep tonight, when he gets up tomorrow, after he has breakfast and a bath ill give him one, should be easier to gauge any differences in behaviour then, and if it helps for sleep ill keep the second 50mg one for later in the night than i did tonight as its a struggle to get him to drink anything as hes suspicious it may have melatonin crushes into it. You‚Äôre post has given 
me a bit of hope that aswell as calm him a bit it will also help him sleep a bit earlier as he has been awake really really late the last few months. I‚Äôll post on any updates in the coming days,"
175898756,"_NAME_, you definitely seem to have trauma from the past.. you do need to go see a specialist, like a psychiatrist and also work with a counselor- they will be able to help you. Take that courage and open up. I know it is not easy for the partner to understand... so u need a professional to help you clarify what is going on in your mind. There seems to be a dichotomy also between you not wanting to lose your wife but you not wanting her to be with you either? Is that because you love her and you feel you could damage her or is it that she does not understand what you are going thru? I think a therapist will help you understand yourself better and maybe the right medication could also make you feel better... a deep sense of loneliness and fear could stem from the brain and a potential imbalance, since you seem to have been thru a lot during your childhood.

175898844,"Understanding Procrastination I‚Äôve gone through bouts of productivity and bouts of procrastination and often wonder what brings on procrastination, what is the source of it, and how do I get out of it? Prior to taking a mood stabilizer, procrastination wasn‚Äôt really an issue for me cause my mania would fuel productivity, and my underlying anxiety would keep me going, and my wheels would always be turning for fear of not completing tasks. But that‚Äôs not the case anymore with a mood stabilizer that curbs that anxiety, and my need for productivity. So now I inevitably am faced with procrastination challenges and issues. But, I think those issues have characteristics that go beyond simply experiencing the ramifications of taking a medication that chills me out a bit, and slows my down. Let‚Äôs examine the initial questions I presented in an effort to better understand procrastination. To address my first question, what brings on procrastination, it‚Äôs a mixed bag? Laziness, fear of failure, and 
a the feeling of being stagnant all play a role in the starting features of procrastination. We can‚Äôt always help feeling stagnant cause what if you are going through depression. You might feel like moving forward is too much of a challenge so the result can be procrastination. Trepidation of failure can result in not even trying a task so you end up with zero outcomes for your goals. Secondly, what is the source of procrastination? For me, insecurity and often times shame. I think when you lack confidence in yourself you are more prone to procrastinate. If you don‚Äôt feel good about yourself, and you don‚Äôt see worth in whatever it is you are trying to accomplish, you are less liking to attempt to achieve your endeavor. Again, an episode of depression can certainly contribute to procrastination but, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to decipher if it is clinical depression or just overall lack of confidence that impedes your inability to accomplish tasks on the horizon. Then there is shame. Shame is an odd experienc
e that can weigh heavily on your mind to the point where you don‚Äôt feel like you are worthy of achieving so, as a result, end up doing nothing.

175898845,"I would often walk in nature, read, and make music in sober places. It helped me to be around people. Boredom is a big trigger. I dunno how I‚Äôd do it without caffeine and nicotine in those sober places. Everyone was just nonstop doing it. And those legal stimulants take the edge a bit off my cravings. You don‚Äôt even consume caffeine these days?? I once was in a sober house and I had an urge to gamble. So I drank a cup of coffee and the gambling craving went away. Weird. Guess I‚Äôm an addict for life. It‚Äôs just minimizing the damage of which substances/behaviors/etc I use. Right now I‚Äôm trying basketball tooo. Maybe that‚Äôll get my mind off weed at times.

If i asked my pdcoc for adderal or vyvanse id probly get it but im done with stimulants i think they just make me worse and put me toward psychosis Caffeine helps me or can trick me into feeling more motivated. Living with forced habits can fight the negs but the feeling doesnt change too much. Ive been taking ziprasidone for a couple weeks now it seems to help motivate at lower dose. But higher dose is more sedating. Im just sticking with 20mg twice a day for now. Feels like its barely enough to control symptoms and if things are worse id just take 40mg at night and 20mg morning.

But with the cup I changed it every 4 or more. I was even able to go overnight with no leaks. I will say there‚Äôs a real learning curve to putting it in and getting it to open up. The June cup is soft, so it needs a little poking to open at times. Then you make sure it is sealed, just a _USER_ID_ to see if it moves down too easy. If it doesn‚Äôt want to move asap then it‚Äôs sealed. Still way better than tampons and gross pads. Once you got the routine down, it takes 5 minutes to change.

Getting him to more of his class trips in kindergarten is a reasonable goal. What will you need to accomplish this? Probably some therapy targeted on anxiety. Maybe an anxiety medication. Maybe a family member or friend who can take him to school for his trip if you can‚Äôt. You have all summer to work on this, so don‚Äôt fret. Guilt is only useful when it motivates us to make positive changes. Otherwise, it just turns to shame, which paralyzes us and makes us hate ourselves. Nobody can improve their life when they

It has been leaving me with a lot of thoughts on how much I have changed over the years. I can remember a time in my life when i thought I was actually doing good in my life. For example, ten years ago I was living in Louisiana working a good job, able to live a ""normal"" everyday life. I would take my son, one at the time, out everyday to the park or the lake. We would swim, go out to eat, play constantly. Even if I look back to five years ago. Thats when my illness was starting to take a turn for the worse. Thats when things were really starting to change with me. I had been living in Kentucky for two years by this point. I was struggling to keep things together at work. I noticed that i was starting to have major issues with my temper. I never wanted to go out and do things anymore. I would come home from work and just want 
to stay at home. I rarely took my son out at this point. I noticed that i started to not feel like myself anymore and even notice that my thoughts were becoming more spastic. I was starting to have trouble remembering things and was having a lot of issues concentrating and focusing. I started drinking more and more. I can say proudly though that I never really got drunk in front of my son. I only ever got drunk when he was at my parents house for the weekend. Now, things have started to get much worse. I can no longer keep track of my days or time. I have dreams and nightmares, sometimes just confusing dreams that make no sense, others that are flashback of past traumatic events or that I'm being chased, trying to find my kids, surrounded by flames and chaos, etc. My hallucinations have hit an all time high. I see things that I can no longer tell if they are real or not. The voices in my head never really shut up anymore. I feel like I'm not safe anywhere anymore. I have a hard time keeping things together no
w. I become more scared everyday that I am going to wake up and not know anything anymore. That I am not going to be able to handle my kids anymore. Im scared that I am going to ""blackout"" (meaning that I am going to do something and not remember what i have done). I have had some in the past, not any recently which makes me feel good. But it feel like something is trying to take over me and that scares me. I can no longer keep my thoughts together. I just don't know anymore. I am trying to seek help, but it is hard to find someone where i live at. Most of the professionals are over an hour away and my car is at its last leg. Sometimes I just feel like giving into it all and letting it all take over. At least then i wouldnt have to fight anymore. But right now that is not an option. I have to try, at least for my kids sake."

175898907,Haha! So true! .
175898908,_AT_MENTION_ thank you
175898909,I have heard of some people saying they _NAME_ technique‚Äô helps their mental health. My understanding is that is about posture and movement
175898910,"rapid cycling, oh no! When do you see your pdoc?"
175898911,"Have you tried meditation? Listen love, there is nothing wrong with being honest. And if you lost friends because you was being nasty due to a mental illness they was never your friends to begin with. Try being more honest upfront. Letting new friends know of your issue and how there are times that you just basically have diarrhea of the mouth. Having episodes are no fun. It‚Äôs like you are on auto pilot. Physically mentally emotionally and spiritually you are on different pages. But being honest with yourself is always a way to make things a little easier for you. Try even grounding yourself. It‚Äôs a form of meditation, like I can hear, I can smell, remind yourself that your illness is not you, it‚Äôs not who you are. Try accepting life for what it is. Have belief in something bigger. Like have faith in the universe and you will be taking care of. If you pay attention to the past too much or you pay attention to the future too much you miss the beautiful things in your life as of now. Yes it‚Äôs 
always good to be kind to others but it‚Äôs most important to be kind to yourself. You are trying the best you can. Take it easy. Hope things get better"
175898912,I can‚Äôt make friends with soldiers. It‚Äôs because I feel like their minds aren‚Äôt on people but are on guns and killing. I tried but only got drunk with them and that wasn‚Äôt good.

And I know I should not compare but not everyone has this particular prison that I have so then I get more sad. Because I do have it. Do you want to guess what I‚Äôm talking about I just feel it is like mission impossible to ever get out of it. Seriously. I just can‚Äôt see an escape route. Btw I‚Äôm not suicidal. I‚Äôm just sad. Do you ever have specific lifelong reasons to be sad? Ie the sadness pops up from time to time over something specific
175898917,I feel like crap too. I guess I need help‚Ä¶ and should seek out my old therapist who I haven‚Äôt seen in a year. Are you in therapy? I wonder how it‚Äôll be over the phone for 45 minutes.
175898918,Sometimes long enough to work is longer than the amount of time you need to know it won‚Äôt work. When I was on seroquel I almost passed out on day two.....it was a no go.....this sounds like a similar situation.
175898919,"As much as I enjoyed suffering for every second for 8 months in the hospital without relief, I opt now for riding around in my car eating chips and listening to an 1980‚Äôs pop CD.

174328795,"I feel frustrated this morning and I feel sad. I've been having issues with my online therapy. My T didn't respond for 2 days this week. She left me a note saying she would respond first thing Saturday morning. She never did. I made the decision to quit therapy. I've had enough of this. It happens quite frequently. I have 3 days left on my subscription. It's too late to switch therapists. Plus, I've been through 4 of them since August and they all ignore most of what I say. I live alone and I don't have family support. So I relied heavily on my online T to be there for me. Now I will have no one. It's scary to think about. I'm not sure what I will do. I guess I will try to meditate more and rely on my faith."
175898929,"And I haven‚Äôt refilled benzos after my last appointment I just can‚Äôt figure out a way to really deal with this, I feel like I just have stuff screwed up with my cognition and knowing about it causes me stress. I think I would rather be blacking out and knowing it after rather than having this hurdle in processing things, I am on the lowest Clonazepam dose as well, if I take it, if I were actively believing in delusions I would start taking my abilify again, I was on both invega and abilify, my choosing, and then I stopped taking the abilify 2 months ago and it hasn‚Äôt caused me to notice any difference. I don‚Äôt know what to do man, how long did it take for you to get thinking better after quitting Clonazepam?"

As far as nutritious foods, can you buy nutritious at the grocery store, such as luncheon meats and potato salad and pork and beans, and lettuce and tomato and fix them ham sandwiches, etc., for lunch? Eggs and bacon and toast and grits for breakfast? And meat, vegetable and starch for supper? Do you cook? As far as getting your kids to respect you, a lot of times my son didn‚Äôt, either. When he grew up and his mother (who encouraged him disrespecting me) passed away, he crossed the line and I didn‚Äôt have anything to do with him for three years. After the trouble he got into because of that, probably, he suddenly straightened up and now he doesn‚Äôt disrespect me. You say, ‚Äú‚Äú

175898944,I understand what you are going through. I struggled with being okay enough to raise my kids. Sometimes getting them to school and making food felt like unobtainable goals. Kids are very forgiving. When I was able I would go for walks with them or try to do something fun. Sometimes I would sleep all day while they played games together. I felt horribly guilty but now my kids are in their teens and adults and they tell me I‚Äôm an awesome mom. Sometimes just realizing ordering in a pizza is as good as it‚Äôs going to get some days. Hang in there. I bet your kids think you are great!

Then I saw him in the coffin and people shovelling dirt onto him and I just wanted to scream for them to stop. The crunching of the pebbles felt so loud and it felt like my brain was going to explode. We got into the car to head back to the church. I didn‚Äôt want to cry but sobs wracked my body. He was gone. Forever. I‚Äôd never see his big smile. Calling me _NAME_ because of my colorfully striped jacket like _NAME_ in the bible. I loved him so much. I thought that I‚Äôd never see him again. A few days later was the first time he appeared to me to bring me comfort. Over the next year he came to me when I was struggling. He listened and guided me in the right direction.

174328793,"Hello, this is my first post in this forum. I am a 31yo man. I have been diagnosed as schizophrenic 5 years ago. I spent the last 7 years dealing with hallucinations (visual and auditory), lost in delusions (my university was spying on me, deleting credits when i was not studying, people constantly watching me in the streets), and fighting deep depression, self-harming (mostly on the chest, abdomen, shoulders and thighs; my ultimate fantasy is to do it on the face but i am too afraid of the social impact it might have). During the last 5 years i tried many different medication : quietiapine, risperidone, latuda, rexulti, sleep medication etc. I finally found a balance with: rexulti 3mg in the morning with anti depressant and quietiapine 200mg in the evening to make me sleep. I had a couple of good years, of course with ups and downs. But all in all I was able to finish my BA and I am almost finished with my MA in political sciences. I am almost at the end of the MA, having only to do a couple of pa
pers and my thesis. As of a couple of weeks, i have been feeling weird again. Lost in delusions of grandeur, automatically followed by deep melancolic states. I start avoiding crowds and going for groceries or social events are becoming more and more complicated. I mutter, shake my head, feel anxious, lost. I have a dreading ‚Äúend of the world‚Äù like feeling. And the voices are going stronger, telling me bad things or to self-harm. I cannot focus on my studies, I am barely able to take showers or to eat. I tend to stare into the void for long periods and people have started to tell me i ‚Äúzone out‚Äù when they speak to me. It hurts me because for a very long period I have been doing really well, having a very good social life, being organized, motivated, confident. And now, it seems that everything is falling apart. I don‚Äôt have the courage to call my psychiatrist, i am afraid to bother him, or other people, and i feel a deep shame about my current state. I tried to cut the booze, succesfully so far. I a
m trying to find advices, if you guys would be so kind, or tips on how you deal with these situations. It has been a long time since I‚Äôve felt so bad and, feeling that all the work i‚Äôve put into feeling better is falling apart/all for nothing, I feel completely lost. I apologize in advance if I bother, or if my post is not desirable or in the right section."
175899000,"I‚Äôm so paranoid. My husband is dealing with potential new tenants for his newly purchased house, and he‚Äôs unsure about them. This set off my paranoid thoughts. I get these thoughts in my head that they will steal his money and come to our house, knock on our door and shoot my husband and maybe me. Even though we live in security complex. God forbid that the evil spirit in my head who is an agent of the devil, will tell him to set this in motion. Please God no. I also have this belief that if I sit by a lighted window by night without curtains, that people will see me inside and shoot me with a gun. Again, I hope the agent of the devil won‚Äôt run to him with this. The moment I express these fears openly, is the moment the evil spirit will run to tell the devil to harm me. I have to pray to God for protection. Am I really paranoid or in psychosis, or is it a feeling people all have? My husband when I told him said no they won‚Äôt shoot us dead. But I‚Äôm scared all the same. I don‚Äôt trust peop
le who relate to us concerning business/ money. Am I being silly or is it part of sza? I fasted first day of Ramadan yesterday and it was hard but survived.

175899005,"I would need to actual proof. I can't think of a serial killer having been diagnosed with SPD, let alone 50%. The only one I could think of is the Iceman, but he was a professional, not the typical serial killer that kills for pleasure. And given he puts all serial killers in that category, it goes against the trait of ""has few pleasures in most activities"". Also, putting antisocial and sadistic personalities, is a circular argument for the most part. They are diagnosed because of their violence, and then make that diagnosis as the ""cause"" of said behavior. This is really shoddy scholarship and a misunderstanding of what those diagnosis are supposed to be about. They are symptomatic, not prescriptive, but he puts this on its head and claims the opposite, which is not shown by any kind of research. In fact those vague constructs have been pretty much shown to be invalid and not showing any kind of intrinsic ""nature"". This author is pretty much out of the 19th century in terms of psychiatry exc
ept he abandoned the idea of feeblemindedness as a reason for ""evil"". Sadistic personality is not even a diagnostic anymore. From what I saw though, I see borderline personality a lot more as a co-morbid diagnosis in serial killers. But then again, psychiatrists usually tend to diagnose them with something, because that is their only tool. If all you have is a screwdriver, you will use it for everything. It does not mean everything is a screw. Just because of the criteria, a serial killer is almost sure to end up high on the psychopathy checklist. It does not mean anything obviously. Most of serial killers have some sort of sex addiction, or a paraphilia of some sort, this is a lot more predictive to future behavior. Its fantasies that are nurtured because they give pleasure, and sometimes are acted upon. The act does not give the kind of pleasure that was expected, so the desire stays, and the fantasies stay, but there end up being an upset and a vexation, so the urge is still there, or comes back pretty q
uickly. I would not call it evil though, or at least it is a very narrow view of the term. Most evil is done by normal people in their every day life, but I guess it would not sell books. But Hollywood evil, or the reverse side of Hollywood, is simply sadistic sex addiction. But then again, Hollywood is only about sex, so there is the one screwdriver to understand everything. I am not sure if that author is more Hollywood than psychiatrist, but he seems more of the former. If you add that he is some sort of specialist of borderline patients, and it is strangely absent from his graph, this is really strange indeed. I want to see his empirical data and studies he uses to back his claims up."

I just can't do low carb. I'm trying to lose weight, but I like bread too much."

175899024,"I was one of the lucky ones from the perspective that I neve had voices. But with meds I‚Äôve heard that the voices can decrease. Also, be gentle with yourself and give your self time to get to the point where you can start the process of recovery. Maybe getting a part time job would help.I did a job of hanging clothes for 5 years but I was out there making some extra money and getting back into a schedule every day.

175899029,I hear lots of voices but they all sound the same the only way I can tell them apart is how they speak. Yes I believe I have a blessed direct line to god. I talk to him all the time. He has givin me peace within. I used to be parinoid of google and cell phones. I could hear them and feel them but not see them till a year an a half ago. There are these hooded ppl I see that have taught me some things like how to make holy water and they told me that true religion is fear of the lord.

174328806,"But that‚Äôs my point. Who are you to say who‚Äôs trying and who‚Äôs not? There are probably people who use negatives or whatever as an excuse, but there are just as many of us who do their damnedest to achieve their current level of functioning. Take myself, for example. I don‚Äôt sit around all day. I wake up in the morning and get dressed and take my dog on a walk. We roam the city, averaging out a three mile treck each time. I come home, we eat, I may shower, I spend time with my mom in the living room unless she‚Äôs working. In the afternoon, I let her play outside off leash. I stand there and watch her for as long as she wants to play so she doesn‚Äôt run off. This is not sit on my phone time because I have to watch her and predict when she‚Äôs going to try and run off and leave the yard and stop her. In the evening, my mom joins me for another 2 to 3 mile walk. We go home, I may shower, my brother makes dinner, we eat. I‚Äôm not perfect. I struggle with hygiene, I guess because it‚Äôs not so
mething that my mind registers as important, but I‚Äôve gotten much better at forcing myself, at caring. But negative symptoms are still just that ‚Äì symptoms, and sometimes it feels impossible to overcome them. Sometimes I deviate from my routine because it‚Äôs difficult to feel like it matters, but I always try to find my way back. And even with this routine, I‚Äôm not able to function like someone my age should. Call it brain damage, immaturity, whatever you like, I‚Äôm doing what I can, and that should be good enough."

175899126,"Hi, I‚Äôm new here. Just wanted to make a post on something I discovered related to antipsychotics and stress. I‚Äôm currently taking zyprexa(Olanazapine I think it‚Äôs called?), and I‚Äôve nocited that one of the side effects of this AP is that it can make me stressed. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it, it‚Äôs just this kind of general anxiety, it can make it hard to fully relax. Anyway, I discovered recently that taking an omega 3 supplement (I take an algae-based omega 3 supplement, one capsule contains 125mg EPA and 250mg DHA.) can lower some of the stress from the antipsychotic I‚Äôm taking. I‚Äôve been taking one capsule a day for a couple of weeks now. I tried taking 2 capsules one day and that actually gave me slightly increased anxiety though. 1 seems to be fine. I‚Äôm vegan btw, so I wasn‚Äôt getting any omega 3‚Äôs from fish etc. Now my question is if anyone has any idea what could possibly be the mechanism behind the decrease in stress/anxiety I‚Äôm experiencing. Could it be because of 
of lowered inflammation? It‚Äôs kind of hard to know, I guess first you need to know the mechanism behind the increased stress from the AP, before you can guess on the mechanism behind the reduction in stress from taking the omega 3 supplement."

If you really don‚Äôt have the symptom profile for sz, get a fully complete physical to eliminate or confirm a physical cause for what symptoms you do have. AD‚Äôs aren‚Äôt happy pills so sometimes the depression can return. Cognitive therapy can be very helpful for depression but it doesn‚Äôt help sz much. What helped me most with the sz stuff was a good antipsychotic. Sometimes the delusional thoughts could be very depressing and no amount of cognitive therapy, or AD, will change that. When I felt a lot of guilt it was because I was doing things I was taught were wrong. Without going into too much detail, I was rather promiscuous and I was taught as a child that that was wrong. I was doing other th

175899237,"DYSTOPIAN CORPORATE SURVEILLANCE threats today come at us from all directions. Companies offer ""always-on"" devices that listen for our voice commands, and marketers follow us around the web to create personalized user profiles so they can (maybe) show us ads we'll actually click. Now marketers have been experimenting with combining those web-based and audio approaches to track consumers in another disturbingly science fictional way: with audio signals your phone can hear, but you can't. And though you probably have no idea that dog whistle marketing is going on, researchers are already offering ways to protect yourself. The technology, called ultrasonic cross-device tracking, embeds high-frequency tones that are inaudible to humans in advertisements, web pages, and even physical locations like retail stores. These ultrasound ""beacons"" emit their audio sequences with speakers, and almost any device microphonelike those accessed by an app on a smartphone or tabletcan detect the signal and start t
o put together a picture of what ads you've seen, what sites you've perused, and even where you've been. Now that you're sufficiently concerned, the good news is that at the Black Hat Europe security conference on Thursday, a group based at University of California, Santa _NAME_ will present an Android patch and a Chrome extension that give consumers more control over the transmission and receipt of ultrasonic pitches on their devices. Beyond the abstract creep factor of ultrasonic tracking, the larger worry about the technology is that it requires giving an app the ability to listen to everything around you, says _PERSON_, a privacy and security researcher at University College London who worked on the research being presented at Black Hat. ""The bad thing is that if you‚Äôre a company that wants to provide ultrasound tracking there is no other way to do it currently, you have to use the microphone,"" says _PERSON_. ""So you will be what we call ‚Äòover-privileged,‚Äô because you don‚Äôt need access to audib
le sounds but you have to get them."" This type of tracking, which has been offered in some form by companies like Silverpush and Shopkick, has hardly exploded in adoption. But it's persisted as more third party companies develop ultrasonic tools for a range of uses, like data transmission without Wi-Fi or other connectivity.1 The more the technology evolves, the easier it is to use in marketing. As a result, the researchers say that their goal is to help protect users from inadvertently leaking their personal information. ""There are certain serious security shortcomings that need to be addressed before the technology becomes more widely used,"" says _PERSON_. ""And there is a lack of transparency. Users are basically clueless about what‚Äôs going on."" News of the future, now. Get WIRED for as low as $5. Subscribe Now Currently, when Android or iOS do require apps to request permission to use a phone's microphone. But most users likely aren't aware that by granting that permission, apps that use ultrasonic 
tracking could access their microphoneand everything it's picking up, not just ultrasonic frequenciesall the time, even while they're running in the background. The researchers' patch adjusts Android's permission system so that apps have to make it clear that they're asking for permission to receive inaudible inputs. It also allows users to choose to block anything the microphone picks up on the ultrasound spectrum. The patch isn't an official Google release, but represents the researchers' recommendations for a step mobile operating systems can take to offer more transparency. TRENDING NOW Hacking a ""Smart"" Sniper Rifle To block the other end of those high-pitched audio communications, the group's Chrome extension preemptively screens websites' audio components as they load to keep the ones that emit ultrasounds from executing, thus blocking pages from emitting them. There are a few old services that the extension can't screen, like Flash, but overall the extension works much like an ad-blocker for ultraso
nic tracking. The researchers plan to post their patch and their extension available for download later this month. Ultrasonic tracking has been evolving for the last couple of years, and it is relatively easy to deploy since it relies on basic speakers and microphones instead of specialized equipment. But from the start, the technology has encountered pushback about its privacy and security limitations. Currently there are no industry standards for legitimizing beacons or allowing them to interoperate the way there are with a protocol like Bluetooth. And ultrasonic tracking transmissions are difficult to secure because they need to happen quickly for the technology to work. Ideally the beacons would authenticate with the receiving apps each time they interact to reduce the possibility that a hacker could create phony beacons by manipulating the tones before sending them. But the beacons need to complete their transmissions in the time it takes someone to briefly check a website or pass a store, and it's diff
icult to fit an authentication process into those few seconds. The researchers say they've already observed one type of real-world attack in which hackers replay a beacon over and over to skew analytics data or alter the reported behavior of a user. The team also developed other types of theoretical attacks that take advantage of the lack of encryption and authentication on beacons. The Federal Trade Commission evaluated ultrasonic tracking technology at the end of 2015, and the privacy-focused non-profit Center for Democracy and Technology wrote to the agency at the time that ""the best solution is increased transparency and a robust and meaningful opt-out system. If cross-device tracking companies cannot give users these types of notice and control, they should not engage in cross-device tracking."" By March the FTC had drafted a warning letter to developers about a certain brand of audio beacon that could potentially track all of a users' television viewing without their knowledge. That company, called Sil
verpush, has since ceased working on ultrasonic tracking in the United States, though the firm said at the time that its decision to drop the tech wasn't related to the FTC probe. More recently, two lawsuits filed this falleach about the Android app of an NBA teamallege that the apps activated user microphones improperly to listen for beacons, capturing lots of other audio in the process without user knowledge. Two defendants in those lawsuits, YinzCam and Signal360, both told WIRED that they aren't beacon developers themselves and don't collect or store any audio in the spectrum that's audible to humans. But the researchers presenting at Black Hat argue that controversy over just how much audio ultrasonic tracking tools collect is all the more reason to create industry standards, so that consumers don't need to rely on companies to make privacy-minded choices independently. ""I don‚Äôt believe that companies are malicious, but currently the way this whole thing is implemented seems very shady to users,"" say
s _PERSON_. Once there are standards in place, the researchers propose that mobile operating systems like Android and iOS could provide application program interfaces that restrict microphone access so ultrasonic tracking apps can only receive relevant data, instead of everything the microphone is picking up. ""Then we get rid of this overprivileged problem where apps need to have access to the microphone, because they will just need to have access to this API,"" _PERSON_ says. For anyone who's not waiting for companies to rein in what kinds of audio they collect to track us, however, the UCSB and UCL researchers software offers a temporary fix. And that may be more appealing than the notion of your phone talking to advertisers behind your backor beyond your audible spectrum. 1Correction 11/3/2016 6:20pm EST: An earlier version of this article stated that the cross-device tracking companies 4Info and Tapad use ultrasonic tracking. Both companies say they don't use the form of tracking the researchers describe

However I have encountered a new problem during rowing: My heart rate quickly exceeds the recommended limit. A possible solution: To lower the intensity of the exercise by doing less strokes per minute. However, to do that I need some sort of clock I can look at, so that I know when to do the strokes. I hope it works. ( I have already sorted out using a stepper and recumbent bike). After sorting out the rowing I am going to move on to strength training and to cognitive training."

174328901,"It's good that you reached out for help. You said you had Bipolar II which net says does not have the full blown mania but rather partial mania or hypomania, and added ""they suffer more often from periods of depression."" Net says, ""ultradian cycling"" is ""having a period of recurrence shorter than a day but longer than an hour."" You also pointed out, 'I have tried a lot of meds over 12 years and finally tried Lithium this past year which was truly the only medication that I found helpful (other than my Seroquel that gets my sleep for me each night) however I couldn't stay on it due to the stomach side effects."" As Bipolar I, I can have full mania along with the depression. For the mania, I, too, take Lithium, 600 mg a day, and for the depression I take Mirtazapine, 7.5 mg a day. Your description for depression brings back some memories, of not being able to get anything done, so it's probably miraculous that you could write to the website. But already being a member probably helped. Net says 
Seroquel is an anti-psychotic used for bipolar and schizophrenia and to treat both mania and depression. You said it worked but you couldn't take it, and that you had tried lots of meds over 12 years, but Lithium was the first one you got to work. How many anti-depressants have you tried? This website also advocates being positive that you can solve the problems, and is discussed in the resources section above the list of names of people writing in with problems. So having a belief that you can solve this is a big help, for it sets us to looking for solutions rather than blocking out such possibilities, which is what negative does. So being positive is not just a luxury. My grandmother had bipolar, but they didn't have Lithium, or basically any other medicines.This was in the 1930s and 1940s and start of the 1950s. So she spent much of her life in a mental institution 100 miles from home with not much they could do for her. So she was warehoused. So the fact that you are being treated at home is a big improve
ment from what my grandmother had. But in the last 50 or more years they have come up with a lot of medicines, for which we can be grateful. There are plenty of anti-depressants."

I mean when I say ""I have psychosis"" nobody generally knows what I'm talking about, so when I try to make things more specific it helps whomever I'm talking to. Instead of saying I have psychosis, I usually try to specify the things I actually am having trouble with, such as making friends, relating with people, etc. It's still a work in progress, of course. I try to be specific though. Like for example right now I am having trouble determining if the medications I take are helping or hurting my creativity."

One of those symptoms is chronic hyperventilation where it feels like you‚Äôre running out of breath but in fact you are breathing too much, even though it doesn‚Äôt feel that way, and that causes the same sensation you‚Äôre experiencing I think. It‚Äôs almost as if you have forgotten how to breathe correctly. There are only a couple of things that help me with this condition. One is taking a deep breath through your nose and blowing out slowly through your mouth. If that doesn‚Äôt work you can breathe into a paper bag like they always suggest for hyperventilation. Are you sure there‚Äôs nothing going on in your life that could because in some anxiety which in turn would make you manifest this particular symptom? I‚Äôm just passing this in
formation along because I know what it‚Äôs like to suffer from that feeling of not getting enough air‚Ä¶ In my case, as unreal as it seems, I‚Äôm actually getting too much air and not the carbon dioxide. I don‚Äôt know if this will help but I certainly hope so and I hope you can find some relief from this most disruptive element ."
174328910,"Ya. Like everybody else said there really isn‚Äôt a difference. I was first diagnosed with adjustment disorder, then delusional disorder and then paranoid schizophrenia. My worst hospitalization the doc said I had psychotic disorder NOS. My wife says I have delusional disorder with psychotic episodes. I think that could be correct if such a diagnosis existed. I am definitely delusional but someone who is delusional and has other psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and negative symptoms on top of that is just quite simply schizophrenic. That‚Äôs the name for it. That‚Äôs what you call it. But like _AT_MENTION_ said. It has to be at least 6 months in duration. Nine years is plenty long enough to be in the club.

You are saying that your doctor won‚Äôt put you on the medication that you want so it is his fault if you end up in bed for the rest of your life. That is concerning to me. My meds gave me the ability to control my negative symptoms, but I still had to force myself to get up and get my life going.

I _PERSON_? _PERSON_?i?, E _PERSON_?, _PERSON_?, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_? _PERSON_, _PERSON_?, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and I _PERSON_i?, Early intervention in psychiatry , Aug 2019 14 The association between various physical illnesses and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) is well-established. However, the role of gender remains unclear. The present study explored the gender-based differences in the prevalence and early onset of chronic physical multimorbidities (CPM) in patients with SSD and the general population (GEP).We recruited 329 SSD patients and 837 GEP controls in this nested cross-sectional study. The primary outcome was the prevalence of the chronic physical multimorbidities, especially in the youngest age group (<35?years).Women with SSD had more than double the odds for having CPM than men (OR = 2.47; 95% CI 1.35-4.50), while the gender-r
elated burden of chronic diseases in controls was nearly the same (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.65-1.22). Furthermore, the prevalence of chronic disease in younger women patients was significantly higher than in controls (P = .002), while younger men did not seem to experience this increased comorbidity burden.This study suggests that women with SSD are at increased physical comorbidity risk compared to men, particularly early in the course of psychiatric illness. Tailored and individualized treatment plans must consider this, aiming to deliver holistic care and effective treatment outcomes."

175899580,"I am new to the forum (just joined yesterday) and have never shared my beliefs with anyone other than the doctors before so I though I would do so. This will be a bit long so bear with me. I am on Latuda now and am stable but these are the beliefs I get whenever I get stressed: (Warning: this can be triggering) People can read my mind. I have all my internet passwords saved in a program called 1Password which requires a single password and a physical key to open. I believe that people in my vicinity can read my mind and are accessing that password. I have to avoid thinking about the password because people can hear it when I think it. So I change the password to have some symbols that are hard to think about so that I don‚Äôt accidentally think about the password. When people are near me, I have to think about a nonsense phrase or some loud music passage so they can‚Äôt scoop the password from my thoughts. The same goes for my address. I have to avoid thinking about my address because people are go
ing to track my family down and slaughter them. So whenever people are near me, I think about something else random but invariably slip up and say my address in my head over and over again. I am being set up. While I sleep, some of the other patients are going to steal my clothes and take my keys, find my car, unlock all the buildings I have access to, and perform horrible acts there and then I will get blamed. Every time someone in the ward gets blood drawn or their height or weight measured, I know that they are trying to find the right candidate to impersonate me and frame me. The reason they measure people‚Äôs height is because they need to find someone who looks like me. I have to hide my clothes so they can‚Äôt impersonate me. Every name I think of will be someone who gets killed that night. Every time I think of a name, that person will die. Someone broke into my house while I was sleeping in the hospital and has a thought-reading device that can track my thoughts from a distance. They have my child an

They mask it by putting other people‚Äôs names but it‚Äôs really about me. Same goes for TV. The news is secretly letting everybody know about my life but they are pretending they are about other things so that they don‚Äôt get caught. I am the antichrist referred to in Revelations in the Bible. I have begun a new era of horrible things in the world. All the birds that fell from the sky that time are because of me. I have committed the ‚Äúunpardonable sin‚Äù by blaspheming the Holy Spirit. (when I have these thoughts, I start ‚Äúblashpheming‚Äù the Holy Spirit in my head uncontrollably which is usually a swear followed by ‚ÄúHoly Spirit‚Äù) People I know are all around me in other forms and with other faces. If someone vaguely reminds me of a person, it‚Äôs because they actually are that person, but with a slightly different face. If I tell someo
ne I love them, I will bring them to Hell when I die. I know I am going to Hell so I need to decide if I want to sacrifice family and friend to keep me company in Hell or if I want to go there alone. So when I say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to someone, I am taking them with me into Hell. I need to confess all my sins by 15 minutes past the hour or I will go to Hell. This means that I need to call people and tell them everything I did to them before the clock hits quarter past. I actually called my boss because of this and confessed things but the problem was that I was confessing some delusions that weren‚Äôt true.

175899606,I used to get way too excited about things. Like I couldn‚Äôt control my excitement and reactions. I thought it was a part of sz because my meds seemed to have calmed me more than anything else. The thing is I don‚Äôt think I even understood my own excitement. I feel now about things ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs reason to be excited‚Äù but I don‚Äôt act so outrageous about it. I can control myself now. And I understand my own glee and my own mania.

175042295,"It won‚Äôt die off because of a variety of factors, not the least of which is that animals can get it. It was possible to eliminate smallpox because of a very aggressive decades long vaccine program, but also because there are no animals that get smallpox, so once it was eliminated in humans there was no one to spread it back to us. Minks, bats and other creatures can get it, and there are lots of them in the wild, so we will not be able to eliminate it. Outside of the animal issue, we also will have it circulating in the human population because a significant number of people are not going to get the vaccine."

175899627,I was watching a show about people with mental illness being put in jail. Crazy that a lot of people with psychosis end up committing small crimes and getting long times in jail. It costs more than being treated with mediation and socially. All the mental hospitals in the past... They were brutal. And mental health awareness only started like 10 years ago or less.. There's so much more to do.. And I'm also passionate about the drug war.. Cuz it's not right.. But I also feel like some secret society did this all on purpose.. They want pain and suffering for money or for fun idk.. Anyways I'm getting my Invega injection on Friday maybe. I'm afraid that it will give me a panic attack when it kicks in... I'm afraid of it deteriorating my cognition as well.. So many things I worry about.. What if my parents die and I end up with a bad crowd and commit crimes? I don't think I would.. I'd likely commit suicide before that happens idk.... It's like my brain is wired to not want to exist. And the people on t

I think T is going to ask me to commit to another length of time of no SH and I want to want to do that but I don't want to do that at the same time. Ugh. I hope it is a good session. Work is so so today. I got the bills done early. I am waiting on a couple of responses so I can finish up a few things. I got the accounts reconciled so that feels good. And I got the sales tax return straightened out. So I feel productive. I'm still depressed though. I don't want to do anything. Just want to chill and lay on the bed and zone out. I might have jury duty next week. I hope when I call the night before I don't have to go. My job doesn't pay for jury duty and I put that on the form you have to fill out but the court sent me back a thing saying it didn't qualify for financial hardship. That's crap. If I don't get paid for 4 or 5 days how am I supposed 
to pay my bills? Stupid jury duty. My arm is kind of hurting from the SH over the weekend. You would think that would be a big deterrent to not do it. But it kind of isn't. HUGS to anyone who wants one! _PERSON_

175899688,"_AT_MENTION_ If it helps, I am eating more food now that when I started losing weight, and I am losing faster now. I made room for a big bowl of raw veggies as a mid-afternoon snack, in addition to my already eaten breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I am still staying under 1400 calories for the day. But in the last two weeks since I started eating the veggies, I have lost weight faster than before. We‚Äôre not talking a small amount, I mean 2 cups of cauliflower or snap peas, 2 baby cucumbers, and 12 grape tomatoes. That‚Äôs pretty significant bulk. I think my body likes the added fiber and nutrients from the healthy stuff, and it‚Äôs willing to let go of the weight since I‚Äôm no longer feeling hungry. It would be hard not to weigh for a full month! I hope your diet goes well for you! _AT_MENTION_ I‚Äôve heard that Lyrica makes you gain. As if APs weren‚Äôt bad enough!

I hurt so much at the time i couldnt pretend anymore on family meetings. Now, i wonder if restoring contact is good. Mum is dying, it is her family.

175899797,"Thanks for you comments _AT_MENTION_ The current pdoc and the depot nurse are much better than what I had in Essex . My query is of an academic/intellectual nature than a ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like them any more‚Äô nature. I don‚Äôt think being asked about mood on the spot helped matters. My autobiographical memory is rather crap at the best of times . Trying to instantly recall and mention past symptoms isn‚Äôt easy. Quite frankly, I‚Äôm the kind to go into ‚Äòbrain fart‚Äô mode in such a situation . It‚Äôs episodic and in remission with some breakthrough psychotic symptoms."
175899798,He‚Äôs getting me set up with counseling and group therapy. He‚Äôs also concerned that I‚Äôm still afraid the men are following me and others are reporting on me to the men. He says he doesn‚Äôt know why my meds never take it away. I feel like my so called delusions are real because meds don‚Äôt work for me. I think they‚Äôd work and make it all go away if it wasn‚Äôt real.
175899799,"It‚Äôs fifty fifty now. I believe them, cos i have been believing them since many months, I am used to them, but at the same time I recognize them as funny products of my mind."
175899800,That‚Äôs not much.....can you goto the food bank they often have like spaghetti and canned food available...they‚Äôre saying have at least three days of backup food but really more like two weeks in case you get sick and can‚Äôt go out.

175899802,I wish everyone would just stop feeding her answers. That‚Äôs all she wants. She doesn‚Äôt want help and that‚Äôs clear from all her posts.
174329001,"I was talking with my little sister about this (She wants to be a psych nurse or counsellor). She's never been really good at math but she was explaining that my mind (Mathematic type) sees ONE solution or answer to certain things.. And when you're doing an English essay or questions, you can say whatever you want because there's many answers.. So like.. Brains that are good at math (Like _NAME_) end up having schizophrenia idk.. Logical INTP personality type.. _PERSON_ I went on an INTP forum and they complain about negative symptoms a lot.. It's a ""Logician"" personality type. I only got my personality and sanity back after I did psychedelics which is weird because they seems to cause psychosis in most people and definitely did in me. I can't explain much of it idk.. But this is all theory because anyone can get schizophrenia. I do believe that schizophrenia is a set of mathematical equations which is why the right therapy should work instead of just draining the brain of dopamine and serotonin 
with antipsychotics.."
175899803,I definitely have considered it. It‚Äôs THAT bad at moments but my doc and therapist all agree that really the hospital is my last resort because they may strip me of all my meds and prescribe something completely against what doc and I want. I can ask them not to. I can ask that they contact my doc. But the variable is still there. It‚Äôs a possibility which would be very bad
175899804,My wife says I have to stay up with the dogs to let them in and out to go to the bathroom. But even if the dogs aren‚Äôt here she won‚Äôt let me go to bed early. I have to take the dogs to day camp every day I go to work. My wife won‚Äôt watch them. She says they are mine and wants nothing to do with them. Even though she may not be sleeping she won‚Äôt let them in and out.

175899809,"I do get it. I smoked almost 20 years ago (2 packs a day for a year), then went cold Turkey off of them and haven‚Äôt touched one since. For some reason lately, I‚Äôve been wanting to smoke. I‚Äôve held off so far. My husband wouldn‚Äôt be a fan. And my kids would definitely give me ????. I‚Äôve been thinking about getting this essential oil smoker thing. It‚Äôs meant to help smokers quit. It‚Äôs basically a bamboo straw shaped nicely and you put little pieces of cotton with essential oils inside (they have some that taste more like tobacco, I guess, and some that don‚Äôt). I‚Äôm glad you said that about having a strong urge out of nowhere, because I do feel that, but not sure why that would be."

175899818,While I get what your T is saying...the only reason anyone goes to the gym is because they should....ok so there‚Äôs a few who totally have fun at the gym weirdos.....

My living situation is pretty toxic, and with the pandemic going on it seems like my boyfriend and I are at each others throats and hes so back and forth with wanting to go to work or not - his opinion on what to do is changing everyday and no matter my stance on it it turns into an argument - he wants to pick up work to take advantage of the money, wants to cancel everything because someone elderly lives with us, wants to do the jobs that will let us come, wants to hold off on everything and not go anywhere, wants to sell locally things around the house and then doesn't because of social distancing, panicking about money and then says things will be tight but we can make it work, then says we need to work as much as we can to bring in something - I just want to get away from everyone in this house.

He says he wants to figure things out together but that's not what ends up happening, he argues with every suggestion I make so I've just stopped. I dont feel valued, I don't feel appreciated and I dont feel like I matter beyond being a work horse and doing what other people want.

Yesterday she had a horrible doctors visit, the guy ripped into her for not seeing a counselor. Totally inexcusable. She was in tears, understandably so. And today she had other health things pop up. The last 2 days have been doom and gloom. I used to be a positive dude. But the last 7+ years I have just... gotten sad, stressed... less optimistic. I know I cannot blame her. But times like these make it hard. I have my own stresses about work, friends family, and they almost always take a back seat. Such as life. Anyways... I just wanted to type it out.

I went to sleep again and woke up to realize that I was in the combination of a vacation house and a psych ward.. So I started going to the lunch line and the head chef was screaming at this guy ""I'm going to ****ing kill you"" because he messed up and I didn't say anything - Then some friends I've had in real life were in the line. I talked to one particular friend and he had a third eye but it was black. I then went outside to go on a jet ski and it was literally like being on the beach. There was so many people jet skiing, sitting in the sand, swimming in the water, waves splashing against the rocks, the sun, blue sky - And I was enjoying the jet skiing, I could use it in the sand too so I was jet skiing th
rough trails - To the vacation house. I decided to say ""Hey lets go dirt biking"" so we went into the garage, a dirt bike appeared in front of me and I went out to a neighbourhood where I had that feeling again - I looked at the houses and they were beautiful. Gold stone, windows, 45 degree angles within each other for the roofs - I was in awe of just looking at how real everything was. I thought ""I would easily be able to draw this and it would be amazing"" and ""This can only be seen on DMT or something"". I woke up and felt so relaxed and told this friend with the black third eye about my lucid dream and he said ""I had one too"" and he kept comparing my dreams to his and he wouldn't stop talking - I realized.. ""I'm still dreaming.."" so I said ""**** this, I'm waking up"" and I did.. I woke up really really relaxed and focused at 4am."

I dont think its the cure all fixer and many over the years told me if its too good to be true it might be too good to be true, and if I can be off it for a year than that means I‚Äôm not ill. But what I did struggle with the year I was off Abilify was the existentialism of being diagnosed with schizophrenia half your life, and an annoying boyfriend who was a user and manipulated me but was also helpful getting me away from my house, and social, he had high confidence and no issues with saying what he was thinking but absolutely ruined things for me and pressured me to use drugs constantly oh and was diagnosed with schizophrenia too and played into it like a psychopath, or maybe he actually had it. He went so deep into his delusions that he convinced others about, and pulled me into his downward spiral every chance he got to do that. He was also jealous of me, I was p
opular and he was jealous that i was a magnet for people, and then suddenly all those people became enemies and i was left with him who pretended to be a friend than betrayed me. So really, I am mad at the system for the whole mental illness epidemic that they are making it out to be like people were born messed up. NO ONE IS BORN with ""schizophrenia‚Äô in that context, schizophrenia is a condition outside the norms, maybe some kind of generational trauma that co-exists with systemic failures of our times or whatever.

175899997,"Separate the things and reevaluate. - One, you haven't been cutting. - Two, you feel worse. - Three cutting doesn't make you feel good. I'm not going to tell you to stop hurting yourself, but none of the above things are related the way you're suggesting. You feel bad because you feel bad. That's what depression does. It robs us of our ability to feel good. Any solutions we come up with feel wrong. It only gets worse when we come up with solutions that cause us additional shame. Because then not only is the depression choking us, but we're making decisions that injure us in ways we can't see and yet, that other people can. Your post starts by saying you hurt yourself and you don't know why hurting yourself doesn't feel as good anymore. There's plenty of reasons for this but the most germane tells us it was a bad idea to begin with. So its not the cutting which has lost its efficacy, its the fact that hurting yourself was never a solution in the first place. You're making it worse."

175900002,"Right ok. The idea behind the comic felt more intense or ominous to me than 'shapeshifting' in shamanic cultures - but also more meaningful as a bigger picture. This is fascinating! I'm understanding this to be the scientific language of etheric projection / out of body experiences close to home. I thinking this describes certain levels of dissociation too - I'm going to have to read it a second time to better understand what was written (I can be slow at understanding things). It's thought provoking because I've always understood OBEs and heautoscopy (though I never knew there was a language of science term) to be one in the same as an experience - and their description of the doppelganger effect of switching back and forth is when people are struggling with leaving their body properly. It's interesting to learn there are differences in the language of science. I used to try to induce OBEs when I was a youth. I could get into extremely deep trances (where I no longer felt my body and stopped heari
ng things from the external world, had no track of time, etc.), but damn if I could induce an OBE - maybe it's because I was lacking a purported medical condition. I did eventually discover lucid dreaming though (as far as I'm concerned). I'm trying to figure out if it's not only having another's experience as if your own, but also an encounter with a darker aspect of self (or others?) - especially after looking at the addition of the Star Wars video clip. I'm not sure what this could mean beyond doppelgangers are perhaps not always a harbinger of death or some other type of ""bad"" omen. I still don't understand the point of 'changelings' (I'll have to look further) and I had no idea Narcissus' reflection might be considered a type of doppelganger. I loved delving into things like spiritism and the other things mentioned (along with many more topics) when I was younger. Sadly, for my health, it's a rabbit hole I have to avoid playing in these days for the most part Again, intense. I'm assuming this describes 
a piece of ""ultimate empathy"" that you mentioned. I would become extremely distressed. {to tangent, I might have found solace in the pythons or anacondas lounging in the branches - unless they're just computer animations} In my mind, I started thinking of almost ""melting-into"" or merging - or being too permeable with others who are also too permeable. ^ As you continued to elaborate (on top of using the term ""identity diffusion""), I started thinking of what you said as similar to this image with the dots being self and the line being an indicator of where one person should end and the other should begin: I thought I was getting a better idea of what you were saying, but then after watching the movie clip I'm not so sure because now I'm understanding there to be a battle of shadow (like in the second doppelganger link and the comic mentioned) along with the mentioned _NAME_ movie's ""ultimate empathy"" (which could risk being physically painful, in my mind). Was there anything you found helpful for it or 
would recommend to others who may experience similar? I guess I was partially wondering if people who are ""imbalanced"" (and yes, I'm aware I qualify ) are more perceptive of things and intune with each other (superstitious, I guess) but maybe it's everything you described along with also maybe being highly suggestible too. As always, it takes me extra time to absorb what you say. I'm going to briefly explore a little in understanding ""metempsychosis"" (it's a new the term) before moving forward to graze on the rest of what you wrote and I'm aware that you prefer to come through the forum at your own leisure - but I did want to say thank you for the in-depth response"

175900007,"I‚Äôve been experiencing this situation when I listen to live radio at times. These are not ‚Äúimagined‚Äù voices, but rather the actual radio/tv presenter saying things during the show. Basically the woman on radio was announcing a competition that the station wanted the public to enter. She went on to describe the exact physical description of the type person she thought would be ideal enter. She was talking about someone is who relatively unattractive and in need of a makeover‚Ä¶ As she described the physical traits of the person she felt would be ideal, it seemed to line up very uncannily to me. However, I am very aware of ideas of reference, and the tendency to link external random things to oneself. So as she was talking I was trying to convince myself that she is simply talking generally. But then she proceeded to say even more oddly specific things about me, like describing the type of scrunchie (hair tie) the person would have in their hair, which seemed to coincide with mine. I was deeply 
offended lol. And I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were describing be. On another occasion, I had been thinking a lot about someone I had dated in the past. The television was on, the news reporter said the name and surname of the person on tv. I didn‚Äôt catch the full context in which she said it but it was bizarre as I had been thinking about the person. It has become difficult for me to see theses as delusions as they feel very real, because the people are actually saying these things. Do you have any experience with this and how do you you cope?

ort bit. I feel like I‚Äôm burdening people. The more I watch myself I know that it‚Äôs better for me to die- to stop hurting people in the process. But I get what you are saying. It‚Äôs unclear that I‚Äôll ever recover from this mentality because I‚Äôm always used to feeling this way since I was young, but I‚Äôll work on it."

175900011,"My pdr doesn‚Äôt want to because he says it has the same side effects as Abilify, it made me hypersexual, impulsive, irritable, addicted to drugs like weed which brought more psychosis, gambling, compulsive shopping and binge eating. I lost more than 100 000$ in 8 years while on Abilify. Also I still had occasional psychosis on Abilify 25mg and wasn‚Äôt stable. What I will try to do is ask my pdr to prescribe me 5mg Abilify in addition to my 3mg Risperdal. 5 mg is the dose for treating depression."

Now that I am on Zyprexa, I am consistently following a 1200-1400 calorie diet and I am down 12 pounds since mid-March. I am determined not to fall prey to Zyprexa weight gain, and in fact, I am determined to lose a total of 49 pounds to get me to my pre-Geodon weight. I gained on Geodon too. Zyprexa is reducing my appetite, so that helps a lot. I love Zyprexa! I have shown that it‚Äôs possible to lose weight on an antipsychotic."

Second time a psychologist took me because I couldn‚Äôt answer her questions. Third time my dad took me because I was wearing a brown hat he thought was ugly and I was acting wierd and I had stopped drinking cause I thought the water was poisonous.

175900096,"severe mental illness (smi) comes with a distinct drop in cardiorespiratory fitness and vo2 max regardless of the condition. You may have noticed pre-crisis your fitness was normal but suddenly it‚Äôs much harder to move, sit still, maintain posture or persevere. The only advice I have is to try to do some fitness to counteract these effects. Try to learn about overvalued ideas, intrusive thoughts and ocd so as not to clog your power source, which is the mind, with unnecessary intrusive thoughts, worries, fears, feelings and urges so your mental force is saved and available for your legitimate work, perception and awareness. Remember it is thought->feeling->behavior. If your thoughts are clouded or compromised so will feelings and next the ability to control, resist, execute and switch movements/actions/behaviors."

175900124,Hey everyone ! I noticed early last year I began to get this slight vibration gurgle noise when I‚Äôd get up from laying on my back usually laying not all the way on my back but upright a bit and when I‚Äôd take a deep breathe. I was pregnant and it disappeared towards end of my pregnancy and now that I‚Äôve delivered it‚Äôs back again and actually worse. I get back pain like feeling in my upper back when I move or try to stretch as well it‚Äôs like an irritation. I have twins so My back is always sore from picking up and leaning over feeding and changing diapers etc. Anyway I notice when I let a baby sleep on my chest and lay on my back I get it as well it‚Äôs like the pressure on my chest irritates or something so when I take a deep breathe I hear it. Usually goes away after one or two deep breathes. It scares the crap out of me. My doctors don‚Äôt know what it is but will send me for an X-ray to see if they can pick up on ahyhing. Anyone had experience with this and any advice ? It‚Äôs making my 
anxiety really reallly bad considering I just had two babies and I‚Äôm always scared of what this means. Thanks!

174329068,"Apparently, when you use memantine as an adjunct to most anti-psychotics, it only helps with negative symptoms, but when you combine it with clozapine or olanzapine, it has an effect on positive symptoms as well. There are a few studies to this effect. Well, I‚Äôm on both, and the combo ( _AT_MENTION_ of memantine) managed to stop a few delusions that only Clozaril has managed to stop before. And, now that I‚Äôm on 20mg of memantine, I feel like I just ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù and my overall rationality and lucidity have improved to near-clozapinesque levels. It has only been a few days but my mind is clearer right now than it ever has been in years ‚Äî except for a brief stint on Clozaril, that is. I never should have been pulled off of it, but every time a hospital would give it to me I‚Äôd have my outpatient clinic refuse me it. It‚Äôs a long story but they basically just thought I was a lying sack-o-*** Borderline, making up stuff to get on meds. I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder from th

From a sustainability perspective though, farming is a huge consumer of water and food, and is pretty calorically inefficient compared to just eating plants, so that‚Äôs going to be a big factor in the future."

I like to first carefully get to know each other in different ways and take time to see how we both feel in the relationship, whether there is commitment, love, safety, matching values and all that. Marriage isnt a garantee for anything, but the idea of waiting helps me. And not just for legitimacy. I wouldnt push that on others though. Some people find sex before marriage wrong, some dont. I think people should be allowed to say sex before marriage is wrong, just as they are allowed to say the opposite."

175900248,"Touching your hair is not really stimming. Stimming generally involves flapping, rocking, or hand waving. The few socially appropriate stims I have seen kids develop usually came about because they were punished for more noticeable stims. the point of a stim is to create sensory output to block an overwhelming amount of sensory input. It needs to be somewhat distracting by its very nature. I have Tourette‚Äôs which involves a certain amount of tics. Tics are similar to stims in appearance, but are done for different reasons. A stimming behavior is done to soothe or regulate sensory processing. A tic is done because the idea of not doing so is physically painful. If I hold in a tic, I get pain in the part of my body that wants to move. Most people in the world also just have nervous habits. These are behaviors that bring comfort, but are easily controlled when it‚Äôs not appropriate to have them. For example, many people bite their nails, but refrain from doing so in public."

I have yet to find a therapist, and I have been having many mental breakdowns lately because of my situation at hand now. The stem of my PTSD is because I have a fear of men from what they have done to me. I fear them because they were the root of to mental health, and for the things I have been through with them since 2017. I have never been able to talk to anyone about my rapes, kidnapping, or abuse. I want to be able to open up as well, and move my mind past it. How can I stop letting my past cause so many panic attacks for me moving forward? How can I stop fearing men?

175900416,Nothing has changed as far as I‚Äôm aware
174329118,"Do you ever feel like people are trying to convey alternate meanings to words they say? Like they speak in a code? For me I feel like there is someone reading my mind and seeing the associations I make with certain words. It feels like beings possess other people and emphasize certain words that only I will understand, sorta like underlining text. For instance someone might say ‚Äúwant to come out‚Äù but I will hear ‚Äúwant to come OUT‚Äù and the association of out of the closet and sexuality will all happen. The voices often like to focus on sexual stuff for me, and political, or racial. For instance I can‚Äôt hear the word brother without thinking African American lately, or if someone says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right‚Äù they‚Äôre calling me conservative even though I‚Äôm fairly liberal. There are many others but these are the most salient, everything starts to symbolize something. Color of someone‚Äôs shirt takes on meaning, sz happens on the verbal intelligence genome and as far as I can tell for me just 
beefs up my tendency to notice symbols be they real or imagined. Heck, there might really be a demon or nymph spirit following me around through possessing people, but it‚Äôs not practical for me to focus on or even notice it. I do hear audible voices but they mostly comment on things I think or say or do in our own little coded language, they might say ‚Äúit is that‚Äù in my girlfriends voice to affirm my thought. Over time this can _USER_ID_ you up pretty bad. They might say ‚Äúcalled it‚Äù in my moms voice or ‚Äúthat out‚Äù in some guy I met several times ten years ago‚Äôs voice. They‚Äôre weird. If you can function without pills and are happy by all means continue with happiness as long as nobody is getting hurt, but meds have saved my life. I get a little suicidal when I stare too deep into the abyss or eat the fruit of knowledge or what have you. I think mine has a mood component, but I‚Äôm dxed paranoid sz. Still high functioning though."
175900417,"I‚Äôm a man but I still am familiar with this significantly. Examples are I got no guidance from my folks about informing my BIL and SIL about my ‚Äútruth‚Äù.

With my brothers girlfriend(my Sister in law now) I told her much earlier in the game. You get a lot for free in living, And theres a lot of stories which is a buzzing topic now it seems. technology and progress are also occurring. And frankly this is a ‚Äúbeautiful disorder in so many ways on so many days‚Äù.

175900427,"I actually pun not intended have some insight on this topic. I was delusional but in the process of getting a grip on things. I‚Äôm was a pretty hardline atheist before onset of my psychotic break and had researched rather rigorous methods for practicing skepticism and for how to practice rationality. My delusion started from my first psychotic break up to about I would reckon maybe 5 months after treatment began. I believed that I saw miracles during my psychotic break and that they broke the underlying rules of reality. That reality was a transitional place where I was about to change to the next state of conciousness. Obviously I could go on, but generally thats the jist of it. About 3 months in I had serious questions about this belief and about why I hadn‚Äôt somehow transitioned into the next stage of reality. The medications were working and I had no more hallucinations of the same nature as during my psychotic break. I understood my thinking was disturbed and I was no longer a reliable sour
ce for insight on the workings of the world as an observer. Later I would have bouts of doubt as to my certainty on this and try to test reality. I would generally know when I would start doubting by the mood I was in. If you start feeling poetic and inspired by the beauty of reality and feel a sense of grandoise awe you might be more manic but also more delusional. Thats what happened with me and I was able to feel this out and wrap my head around it and generally keep trucking with rationalism and skepticism and now while I‚Äôm not as hardline an atheist as I was previously I after all had a direct supernatural experience of which I was a direct observer I understand that I‚Äôm not a reliable source of insight on the inner workings of reality anymore."

Or maybe a side effect of the Zoloft that I am taking (though I have been on that for about 7 months, so I am not sure why this side effect would just start now).

But I opened my eyes And peering over My right shoulder I could see that sarcastic smile If I was stronger I would have slapped That sinister grin Right off that evil face I can‚Äôt even begin to tell How deeply he bruised My soul And cowered at the thought Of his sickening hands Touching me His putrid breath Smelling like he‚Äôd consumed A dead carcass I often wondered if he was A man Or a demon sent To haunt me To make words Entering my brain and Spewing out of my mouth Like torture Vomiting out of me Seeping through the cracks And pooling on the concrete I wanted to be rid of him But my weakness Had become my enemy. Scared to let go Scared to fall if I did A year

faked everything and them not taking me seriously. They think I have a severe mental illness. My thinking is that I faked it as I was neglected as a child and put into foster care at age 9.

A Pawe?czyk, E ?ojek, N ?urner, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_?czyk, Early intervention in psychiatryREFERENCES, Feb 2020 12 Higher order language skills, for example, non-literal language, humour, prosody deal with 'what is meant' and they are necessary for communicative exchange and relationships; No study has investigated their link with conversion to psychosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such skills could act as predictors of the onset of psychosis, and compare those of individuals converting and non-converting to psychosis with control of cognitive functions.Seventy-three patients, aged 15 to 32?years, fulfilling ultrahigh risk criteria took part: 14% of whom were receiving antipsychotic drugs. The study was observational, prospective and longitudinal in nature, and scheduled for 60?months. Pragmatic language skills were evaluated using the Polis
h version of the right hemisphere language battery. The ultrahigh risk (UHR) criteria were evaluated with Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States; attention, intelligence and verbal fluency were controlled.The conversion rate was 25%; converters demonstrated impaired humour comprehension and metaphor explanation abilities; composite score of pragmatic language was associated with a hazard ratio of 6.0 (95% CI 1.8-20.5) and AUC of .73. Verbal fluency was an independent predictor of conversion, but attention and intelligence were not; pragmatic language skills were associated with social function but not with prodromal symptoms.The results suggest that deficits in humour comprehension and metaphor explanation could predict conversion to psychosis. These findings could improve diagnosis and create implications for speech and language therapy in UHR groups. Further studies on the mechanisms of pragmatic skills should analyze their relationship with abstract measures and semantic coherence."

174329152,"Discover Magazine The Insanity Virus Schizophrenia has long been blamed on bad genes or even bad parents. Wrong, says a growing group of psychiatrists. The real culprit, they claim, is a virus that lives entwined in every person's DNA Knowable Magazine | Annual Reviews ‚Äì 9 Nov 17 Why Norovirus Is ""The Perfect Pathogen"" It‚Äôs responsible for 58 percent of food-borne illness in the United States. Norovirus has been known to medicine since at least 1929, when a pediatrician described ‚Äúwinter vomiting disease.‚Äù In 1968, an outbreak at an elementary school in Norwalk, Ohio, was tentatively linked to a virus, christened the ‚ÄúNorwalk virus.‚Äù Just because it has been only known to medicine by 1929, doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt exist before then by simple logic. It could have existed decades before or even longer due to lack of medical sophistication, technology, education, and advancement of society; something to LOOK into. I do remember reading something about it being in Finland before that so 
it could inch closer to _PERSON_‚Äôs definition of schizophrenia or the first well known historical diagnosis of schizophrenia. (I‚Äôm excluding the cases of _NAME_ of _PERSON_ and stuff because it could be other reasons and it gets complicated‚Ä¶). Look how the Norovirus spreads. It spreads with poor sanitation and close contact. It gets into the genes and could mess with them over long term and do stuff like _AT_MENTION_ said. Furthermore, look at British Industrial revolution like the time of _NAME_ and I remember his stories of the poverty, sress, close quarters, filth, etc. It could spread through air, poor sanitation, water, feces, food, etc. Industrial Revolution 19th Century en.wikipedia.org Industrial Revolution The Industrial Revolution, now also known as the First Industrial Revolution, was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to mach
ines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. The Indu... It‚Äôs important to note that a 70 year old person has a 5x or 500% chance of getting Norovirus in their lifetime. It‚Äôs a common winter bug that probably is residing in our genome. Combined with other factors, I don‚Äôt know like poor immune system, drug use, stress, etc. stuff already been researched could increase the risk for sure. I just think with my calculation we can find the root cause or silver bullet to this thing. Time will tell for sure. I mean if we want to go back to ancient time and argue about _NAME_ of _PERSON_ than we can say Stomach _PERSON_ and Winter illness existed since the dawn of time. Personally, I think the increase of awareness and prevalence of schizophrenia over the years since the Industrial Revolution is due to humans moving and living very closely together. Before, humans 
were spread out sparsely and we only have few cases of ‚Äòman men‚Äô in history. Currently, what 7 million people in the US have schizophrenia and 1/4 have some sort of mental illness or had experienced or will experience one in their lifetime? That‚Äôs a lot of _NAME_ of _PERSON_. My opinion is it could be a lot of reasons."

The Positive Emotions Program for Schizophrenia (PEPS) is an emotion regulation strategy training that aims to intensify positive emotions and develop positive performance beliefs. A randomized controlled trial showed that PEPS is effective in reducing the composite score of the reduction of experience syndrome (anhedonia and apathy). The present study is designed to evaluate its feasibility in natural conditions to measure external validity of PEPS. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one participants recruited through the French national network of expert centers followed eight ses
sions of PEPS and were assessed pre- and posttest with the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP). The scales of the SANS were divided into a composite score of the reduction of the ability to experience and a composite score of the reduction of expression. Results: All participants followed the 8 sessions of PEPS, and both composite scores were significantly and clinically improved at posttest. Social functioning assessed with the PSP was also improved. Conclusions: This field test shows that participation in PEPS is accompanied by a reduction of negative symptoms and an improvement of social functioning. Both negative syndromes, reduction of expression and reduction of experience, are improved. Participants are younger than those in previous studies, which may explain this unexpected result. However, this calls for a controlled study with younger participants."

No psychosis, though, which is great, of course. I am grateful for today, I am. But I just don't understand what my brain is doing these days. Is this my new normal? Sort of unstable a lot, rapid fluctuations in mood and stuff. _PERSON_, really. Just dunno. But if it is, I will find some way through this. Somehow. Have been looking at stopping my depakote maybe. Some people on the bp board call it depressakote, so, maybe my depression has been due to that or something. I might talk to the doc abou this and see what he thinks. The more we learn about lithium, the better we learn it is for depression, even unipolar. Way better than a lot of traditional antidepressants.So, maybe with the lithium and without the depakote I might feel better."

I came across Mark _NAME_. He has really great videos on YouTube which I found helpful. He also just recently wrote a book, which I bought, and found really helpful as well.

In the active group the PANSS total went from 63 to 50. Most of the improvement came from negative symptoms, with an amazing 64% of the group responding. They did not find efficacy for cognitive symptoms for this therapy. the reason may be that the promotion of L-DLPFC on cognitive function is limited to specific cognitive domains I‚Äôm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe another part of the brain is more responsible for some of the cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, the results of the PANSS_N are shown that the improvement rate of patients‚Äô negative symptoms reached 48% after post-iTBS treatment, the improvement rate of clinical negative symptoms reached 64% in 2 months (_PERSON_, 2014) (Fig. 1)In our study, we 
compared the efficacy of a 2-weeks intervention with iTBS or sham applied neuronavigation on L-DLPFC in schizophrenia patients for remission of symptoms, and it was our first time to provide the preliminary results of RCT study on clinical symptoms and cognitive function improvement in patients with chronic schizophrenia. We found iTBS had a particularly preponderant and relatively stable clinical effect in terms of improving total symptoms, especially negative symptoms. The main highlight of our study is the powerful advantage of iTBS on L-DLPFC in relieving symptoms and maintaining therapeutic efficacy to validate the clinical efficacy of long-term TBS (_PERSON_, 2017). MRI-neuronavigation can accurately regulate the activity of the L-DLPFC, which may activate the neurons in the prefrontal cortex so as to relieve the symptoms(_PERSON_, 2019). Although the exploratory results of our study preliminarily show the role of iTBS in improving the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, we failed to find the improvemen
t of long-term TBS on overall cognitive function, the reason may be that the promotion of L-DLPFC on cognitive function is limited to specific cognitive domains."

175900842,Hey _AT_MENTION_ just checking on how you are doing today.
175900843,I use an app called Lifesum. _AT_MENTION_ mentioned it in one of her posts. It tracks what you eat and tracks your calories. Also tracks water intake. I really like it so far.
175900844,Good day _AT_MENTION_. I‚Äôve found it gets easier the more you do it. Even if I‚Äôm totally demotivated the routine gets to where I just do it.
175900845,"Lol, looks like my old cats litterbox after I fed him just pumpkin and curry for three days."

175900847,"I chose to change psychiatrists over the years, but they‚Äôre still there. I‚Äôve seen my current one for over a year. I had the same therapist for 3 years, but he left to work elsewhere.

175900853,I know they are serious. I‚Äôve been dealing with them for awhile. It‚Äôs a big reason why my life is unstable right now. I know jobs come and go but it hit me harder then expected which is why I‚Äôm debating the hospitalization while I‚Äôm out of work.

175900855,I think most of us do. I would like to be well enough to get a respectable job. Its not like im lying about my acquired learning disability. But some people seem to think we make excuses.

174329224,"Why would he have that goal? Why would he work in that way? Why do you think that the _NAME_, or he, want to make others feel that they are everywhere? This is so classically schizophrenic ‚Äì a very, very common symptom of schizophrenia ‚Äì that pigs could fly before I would believe that he, a real person, had the power to read thoughts. Please read these forums. There are loads of people claiming that others, people they pass in the street, checkout operators, people on TV, can read their thoughts. Here I think that we are getting at the nub of issue. If he can see what you see, then is it not possible that he is you? (I always thought it was ‚Äústicks‚Äù but I am not sure). Can‚Äôt he be going fishing? Going to his allotment? Going to see his farmer friend? As I responded above, I don‚Äôt think that 6 in the morning is early. As people get older, some of us at least, get up earlier. I used to think that 6 is early. These days, now that I am 54 (in 180 minutes) I get up before 5 am. How old is he
, approximately? If you met him ‚Äúcloser to his house‚Äù does that mean fairly close to his house? How close? If pretty close then the only thing you need to explain is why he is getting up (from your point of view) so early, or (from my point of view) late. In other words, there is nothing for you or your readers to rationalise. If you meet someone near their house at a normal time for them to be up in the morning, then no rationalisation is necessary. What needs to be rationalised imho, and why I (a non schizophrenic) am here, is why so many schizoprenics (and I!) feel that someone else is looking out of their eyes. Why do we feel that some one is looking out our eyes?"

I just say it to you, if you are not really wanting it then you will have a really hard time. It will be a hard time anyway. Some people have no withdrawl but most will have.

175900938,"If I remember correctly from my psych classes and what therapists have told me about PTSD, everyone gets post traumatic stress. Its nigh impossible to not be affected by something in one way or another after something traumatic happens. The key word in PTSD is disorder. Almost everyone gets post traumatic stress, but not everyone gets the disorder part. For example, after a car accident most people would have heightened anxiety driving again after the accident, maybe even some nightmares, but it lessens over time. After my accident I have nightmares, flashbacks, I avoid the highway at all costs, and almost refuse to drive in the snow. (My accident happened on the highway in the snow) Like most mental disorders, it becomes a disorder when daily living is impacted or impaired."

Although the recovery approach is endorsed in many countries, qualitative research examining its impact on service use experiences has been lacking. This study aimed to explore this impact as well as experiences of service utilisation and suggestions for change with people diagnosed with a First Episode Psychosis between 1995 and 1999. Participants had used services during the 10 year period prior to, and 10 years post, policy and legislative shifts to the recovery approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 participants who met criteria for 'full 
functional recovery' and 10 who did not. Data were analysed using Thematic Networks Analysis to develop Basic, Organising, and Global Themes. Over time, recovered participants perceived an improvement in service quality through the 'humanising' of treatment and non-recovered participants experienced their responsibility in recovery being recognised, but felt abandoned to the recovery approach. Findings suggest the importance of viewing service users as demonstrating personhood and having societal value; examining the personal meaning of psychotic experiences; and matching expectations with what services can feasibly provide. The implementation and the principal tenets of the recovery approach warrant further investigation."

Its connections to the ventral striatum seem to be particularly important in motivation and therefore anhedonia. GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter), glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter), serotonin, and opioids may also play their part. Specifically, the study looked at treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. The authors concluded that ""ketamine rapidly reduced the levels of anhedonia."" Ketamine blocks N-Methyl-D-aspartate rece
ptors, thereby preventing them from being activated by glutamate. This infers that glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, might play a role in anhedonia."

I didn‚Äôt even think about depression, until my mom recommended to the doctor for me to write down on a graphed paper, how I rated my emotions, and it became pretty apparent that I was fairly depressed. Depression medicine tends to work better on those who feel it the hardest, and I hope you feel optimistic about that. I feel so much happier now, and I‚Äôve gotten a dog, and having a companion animal to love has made me feel even better. You might not want to be optimistic about people or _USER_ID_, but be optimistic that you can feel a lot better given you luck out and find the medicine or mix of medicines that get you where you need to be.

You know without this support and disability benefits my life would off been pretty bad and I‚Äôd be in poverty, worst off all I‚Äôll have nobody to fall back on if things went wrong. The worst thing is I was lonely at the time too. Loneliness is horrible. Despite my diagnosis and difficulties I have a good life, an amazing support network, good friends, secure accommodation, don‚Äôt have to worry about money. I went on three holidays abroad last year.

I worked shoulder to shoulder with them for four years and I got my share of put downs or rude remarks but none of them knew I had a mental illness. If they had known, believe me, I would have heard about it all day. And incidentally, I was one of the best workers for almost three years. But yeah, I worked under stress, working fast as possible, and lifting heavy things all day and I was treated normally enough. I mean working in such close quarters, I would have known immediately if someone had thought I was mentally ill. And also I took packed buses to get to work with school kids and other people for an hour and a half one way, and then an hour and a half back. I didn‚Äôt stand out and nobody really hassled me.

174329307,"""A new paper published in Psychiatry Research sheds some light on this phenomenon, or why smoking weed seems to unleash a stream of loose associations. The study looked at a phenomenon called semantic priming, in which the activation of one word allows us to react more quickly to related words. For instance, the word ""dog"" might lead to decreased reaction times for ""wolf,"" ""pet"" and ""Lassie,"" but won't alter how quickly we react to ""chair"". Interestingly, marijuana seems to induce a state of hyper-priming, in which the reach of semantic priming extends outwards to distantly related concepts. As a result, we hear ""dog"" and think of nouns that, in more sober circumstances, would seem to have nothing in common."" That is absolutely fascinating but it's a symptom of psychosis. I suppose you have to really fit into a certain box to be considered psychotic.. but you only have to fit in a certain amount of boxes.. like 4 or something.. which to me is very strange. Psychiatrists bring a lot of 
strange things to the table with psychosis. It seems like every person with a mental disorder comes with psychosis possibly. Also anyone can become psychotic because no one knows how to predict it. Genes, possibly.. but we're not very good at that yet. There is a cure for psychosis, it's just a matter of when. I'm confused as to how weed and psychosis relate. Because ""High"" means happy. Many drugs do that. But there's certain characteristics about certain drugs like weed that we call, ""Psychedelic"" - meaning, ""Soul-revealing"" or ""Mind-manifesting"". Very weird stuff.."

O _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Community mental health journal , Aug 29 2019 This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two different cognitive-behavioural therapy programs in patients with schizophrenia and clarify which techniques are more effective on psychotic symptoms. With this purpose, 39 schizophrenia outpatients-assessed by independent assessors using Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms and by researchers using Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales-were randomly assigned to routine care (RC), RC plus COPE-CBT or RC plus CBT groups.

Here, we sought to evaluate how a history of severe OCs is associated with cognitive functioning, indicated by Intelligence Quotient (IQ).We evaluated the associations of a history of OCs and IQ in 622 healthy controls (HC) and 870 patients on the schizophrenia (SCZ) - bipolar disorder (BIP) spectrum from the ongoing Thematically Organized Psychosis study cohort, Oslo, Norway. Participants underwent assessments using the NART (premorbid IQ) and the WASI (current IQ). Information about OCs was obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Multip
le linear regression models were used for analysis.Severe OCs were equally common across groups. SCZ patients with OCs had lower performances on both premorbid and current IQ measures, compared to those without OCs. However, having experienced more than one co-occurring severe OC was associated with lower current IQ in all groups.Severe OCs were associated with lower IQ in the SCZ group and in the BIP and HC groups, but only if they had experienced more than one severe OC. Low IQ might be a neurodevelopmental marker for SCZ; wherein, severe OCs influence cognitive abilities and increase the risk of developing SCZ. Considering OCs as a variable of neurodevelopmental risk for severe mental illness may promote the development of neuroprotective interventions, improve outcome in vulnerable newborns and advance our ability to make clinical prognoses."

175901563,"Hello all - long time lurker, first time poster. These boards and posts from the members have been invaluable as I have been navigating my issues with depression and anxiety disorder. So thank you to everyone that takes the time to share their problems and advice. They both help. I was on a very low dose of lexapro (5mg) for almost a year approximately one year ago. At the time, I also was given a prescription for xanax (for bouts of anxiety) and ambien (to help me sleep). While I needed to rely on all three at first, I quickly found that the Lexapro was enough to make me functional and to get through my day. Because of various personal and professional issues, I have found myself again dealing with both depression and anxiety. This time, I am on 10mg of Lexapro. More disturbingly, I am finding that I need to rely on both the ambien and the xanax much more. On most weekdays, I find that I really need to take 0.25mg of xanax (I break a pill in half) to ""get the nerve to dive into the day"". And mos
t nights I find that I really need to take 0.25mg of Ambien to really fall asleep. It is coming up on about six weeks now that I started on the Lexapro so I am assuming it has fully kicked in. I know that, relatively speaking, these are small doses. But I am still worried about whether I am building up a dependency to the Xanax and Ambien. Anybody have any experience with this?"

175901570,"There are lots of psychologists that claim that people in general are in two minds.

It seems to me that in order to keep one mind ‚Äúin two minds‚Äù, necessarily involves hiding one or the other, and that may be made possible if one does not like to see one of them because it is in some sense a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. So, the situation that you find yourself may be quite normal for humans, which makes you entirely human.

175042900,"Hello _PERSON_ and all others I have been in it for a while....on meds, not sure it‚Äôs the right one yet. Going thru depression and anxiety AND menopause. It just makes it more complicated with a hyperactive thyroid... etc. I had postpartum after my second daughter (16y ago) and another bout of depression engulfed me beginning of the year...due to life circumstances... and then COVID hit! Needless to say, this added to everyone‚Äôs plate!! what I have found helpful is reading. Especially when I am going thru that deep pain and cannot seem to get myself out of it. It distracts your mind (u ha e to focus on the words, meaning) and gives you some helpful input. I read ‚ÄúUnstuck‚Äù by _NAME_. I thought he had some very helpful things to say that we can all practice. I am not against meds, I feel it stabilizes your transmitters in the brain and once you can think a bit more clearly you can tackle the rest also. Because I also think that thru whatever stress that causes the depression etc. our hormones
/neurotransmitters are affected...... so that needs to be addressed. However, it takes a while to find what works for you in terms of meds. Genesight test has helped with that. Talk to your psychiatrist. It is a simple genetic test. Mouth swab to determine what meds would work best for you. I am a big reader and other books like ‚Äúthe upward spiral‚Äù by _NAME_ korb.... I found very helpful. Try and apply a few of the things they write about, you ll see a difference. Other than that, I walk a lot, it keeps me healthy and my pups need it... talk to friends... and therapy is a must....! Let it all out! All the positive news about the vaccine helped me too. Took some of the anxiety off.... I am sharing all of this in hope it does help at least some of you - depression is a monster that we have to slay.... but it only works bit by bit.... little steps if you can ....... and see what helps..... I find the more information you have about depression and everything you suffer from the more you will be able to help y
ourself move forward.... Also _NAME_ mentioned depression is not a disease but a sign that there is something you have to deal with, a change you have to make..., he is probably right, so find a good therapist and go to the bottom of things.. Love to you all, Be compassionate especially with yourself. ? _NAME_"

175901597,"Hi AK, I have found that Positive Mantras are my key go to tool for relieving physical symptoms. Our internal dialogue directly effects our mood, which then triggers/exacerbates the sensations that we feel in our bodies when anxious. Even subconscious negative/fearful thinking takes its toll...so countering any anxiety that we feel with positive reassuring statements helps reverse the undesired symptoms. Some of my go to mantras are: ""I am okay, this is just anxiety making me feel this way."" and ""I have been through this before and everything turned out fine."" ""This is just anxiety, it can't hurt me."" It seems very simple...and it is, but it's also a difficult practice/discipline to keep up with when you are swept up in a panicked state... ...so be sure and practice saying the phrases to yourself on a regular basis. With time, you'll find that your overall anxiety levels will be lower...and you'll be able to put your skills to work if you do have an especially challenging time with the anxiou

174329387,"Interesting, I heard of peoples with schizophrenia usually have a different brain structure and how chemicals in the brain effect different parts causing hallucinations. I do agree with deficit schizophrenia might be a different disease all together with some common symptoms."
175901619,I'm waiting for my doctor to call me on the phone. He was supposed to call 20 minutes ago. I phoned the office and asked if he forgot and they said that he would phone me. I can't do anything else while waiting. I'm anxious. I can't organize my thoughts. I don't know what to do.
175901620,I don‚Äôt think there is but thats just my opinion.
174329385,I have very similar thoughts.
175901621,I get redirected sometimes. Maybe one in 50 threads. It‚Äôs not all the time and no idea why it happens so can‚Äôt help you there. I do try and browse most threads though and it may be because I‚Äôm trying to access many threads in a row‚Ä¶

175901628,"I have these episodes where I feel overwhelmingly fearful. When I had my psychotic break, I experienced what I would describe as sheer terror. It shook me to my core and ever since I‚Äôve struggled with feeling like I am unsafe. What do you do to feel better when you‚Äôre feeling afraid? Does anyone do any helpful self-talk?"

175901630,"I don‚Äôt think he can, he can just renew the same prescription. My psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt want me to change meds, maybe thats why he doesn‚Äôt want me to see psychiatrists anymore."

175901637,"Have your voices ever made you smile? Either because they‚Äôre being nice or funny? Lately I only hear three recurring voices. I hear one voice that only ever really says things that I enjoy, _PERSON_. She either says really nice things or really creepy things that are weirdly hilarious. She often tells me she loves me, that I‚Äôm beautiful, I‚Äôm cute or I‚Äôm amazing. She also says the aforementioned extremely bizarre stuff. From memory she‚Äôs said ‚ÄúI want your face‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see color,‚Äù ‚ÄúI hate drugs,‚Äù and my personal favorite, ‚ÄúHave you seen my eyes?‚Äù. Bizarre, but really amusing too. My other voice, _NAME_, is hit or miss. He‚Äôs mostly a jerk nowadays but in the past he‚Äôs told me he loves me, told me I looked cute when I looked in the mirror, told me I‚Äôm funny and smart. I used to have a mean voice called _NAME_ (_NAME_ and _NAME_? Anyone get the old song reference?), but I don‚Äôt hear from her anymore, and I think he‚Äôs kind of taken over as the source of mean voice
s. That being said, I still hear an ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù from him every now and then. My third voice is just a genderless whisper. I call them _NAME_, which is a reference to It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia. They‚Äôre also hit or miss, but they‚Äôre much nicer than _NAME_. More I love yous or complimenting me. They often appear when I‚Äôm crying and provide comforting words. What about you guys?"
175901638,"My depot nurse has mentioned about moving me onto the three monthly version. It takes time though, as pinning down a pdoc to sanction the change isn‚Äôt easy."
175901639,I‚Äôm sitting here eating cheddar bunnies (baked snack crackers) lol
175901640,I experience this a lot. It‚Äôs one of my biggest motivators to lose weight. But I let the voices have too much power. It‚Äôs really not healthy. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with this.
175901641,"I did 14,000 steps today just at work. Have burnt 856 calories today"
175901642,"I wanted to find like-minded people on schizophrenia.com since I have struggled with schiz‚Äô for 5 1/2 years and for the last year have been getting better, BUT‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶It would be good to find like-minded folks who go through that wondering of finding others. I met aliens and gods and goddesses and they all talked to me extensively for years. It became negative, and that‚Äôs when fam‚Äô noticed there was a problem. However, I always wondered‚Ä¶ now that I am better, is there anyone else out there that feels that they both have schizophrenia and a curiosity about aliens, and truther topics, too? How far do I go?! Who else is out there, someone say hello back! Any followers of _NAME_ out there?"
175901643,"Yeah if you‚Äôre not getting outside, and don‚Äôt drink 2 gallons or more of milk you might be low on vitamin D, sunlight and supplements are pretty much the only way to get it. Once we all started living indoors they started supplementing cow milk."
175901644,"Is there anybody , like a social worker, that you could speak to. You may be entitled to receive more benefits than you‚Äôre getting if you have a dependent child. Sorry, I don‚Äôt know how it works in the USA‚Ä¶"
175901645,You have violent tendencies. Plus you‚Äôre a teen. Meds affect teens differently than adults. They need to go slowly to make sure you‚Äôre ok. You are not escaping. You need to be there. Just accept the program and do your best to hang in there. The psych ward isn‚Äôt as bad as prison. Just remember that when you get sick of being there.
175901646,"Thank you, _NAME_. I have spent the past month checking on my sister and making sure that she is getting started with recovery and treatment and doctors, etc. I am back here now because the stress on myself was a lot and I cannot help care for her and my own family if I am not in a good place to care for myself."
175901647,"To be honest, I love it. I‚Äôll never quit."
175901648,The eyes are fantastic.
175901649,I‚Äôm also a thought broadcaster and have had it for year. I‚Äôm hoping that amyloban 3399 will bring some relief to it as I just started it. My thought on TB is that its subconscious communication between people that of which they are not really consciously aware of it. Sometimes though I get impressions like smiling or laughing that makes me think they are hearing me.
175901650,"hmm, hopefully the injection will start helping more soon, sounds like it will. I guess for now just try to keep going to classes and doing your assignments, you don‚Äôt want to fall behind when you‚Äôve done so much work & achieved so much already. have you tried any supplements?"
175901651,Like there's cognitive issues with processing too much information at once and getting overwhelmed
175901652,Yes I am on anti psychotic and anti depressant medications. Intrusive thoughts is a new experience for me
175901653,Why what‚Äôs going on _AT_MENTION_?
175901654,"I never got into a knife fight but I nearly did, I just backed up. I got into physical fights when I was young but now I stay away from trouble friends. I had an annoying friend who fights regularly in clubs vs gangsters. He broke bottles and glasses on other‚Äôs heads. I just leave him alone and go back home when he gets into fights, I don‚Äôt want to get stabbed, shot or killed. I stopped talking to that friend bcz he gets me in trouble, fights and into drugs like cocaine and weed. Better have no friends than having bad friends."
175901655,I agree. I will try a low dose if my Pdoc prescribes it for me.
175901656,Don‚Äôt kill your self! Can you call suicide hot line and talk to your psychiatrist about it. Things can get better. Hang in there. Love to you!!!

174329396,for me my weight didn‚Äôt change since starting clozapine‚Ä¶ but my weight gained when i was put on risperdal and then clozapine was added and it stayed the same.
175901660,Ty _AT_MENTION_ I so appreciate your supportiveness
175901661,"I‚Äôm either watching YouTube/Netflix, reading something online, playing video games, writing, listening to music, walking my dog, going for a walk, going for a drive, cooking, cleaning or sleeping."
175901662,My pdoc said he doesn‚Äôt prescribe Haldol
175901663,I have an over active mind to distract me from other pain. You always have the option of not reading me.
175901664,For sure I‚Äôll do that
174329386,I wonder the same thing. I wonder about sti viruses in particular if they can hide in cells away from the immune system and evade detection by tests‚Ä¶ :((
175901665,"No, I can‚Äôt express or feel emotions."
175901666,_AT_MENTION_ Very emotional is right.
175901667,"When I get yelled at or reprimanded at my volunteer job, I remember. When I experience thought insertion, I remember. When I get so mad that I hang up the phone on someone, midsentence, I remember. When people tell me to ‚Äúquit yelling‚Äù at them, I remember. When I‚Äôm up all night long and can‚Äôt sleep, I remember. When I don‚Äôt change my clothes for days on end, I remember. Etc‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶"
175901668,"do you kill people? if not you don‚Äôt have to worry about it the voices in your head can‚Äôt do anything but talk, it‚Äôs YOUR head they‚Äôre in, which is in YOUR body. it might not feel like it but YOU have control. without your help they can‚Äôt kill anyone, they can only talk the voices sound manipulative - whether they love you or not you deserve better than that, so don‚Äôt feel bad about evicting them from your headspace."
175901669,"well I did this, 100% I flooded my mind with a fight back"

175901681,the link is broken
175901682,I stay up all night and sleep during the day I hate it but its so hard to fix
175901683,I think your being too hard on yourself. Especially with our disease - your more than entitled to treat yourself now and again. You cant take it with you when your dead.
174329391,"I have lived by myself for over a year and I am financially self-sufficient. My parents live 10 minutes away, so that helps. Since I work outside the home, I do interact with my coworkers.

175901692,I'm going to listen to a podcast and then I'm going to meditate I don't know what to do. What is reality? Why do I exist? Why are people so opinionated? Do they matter? Does anything matter? Why is there war? Will world war 3 happen? Has it already happened? Am I in the matrix? Have I gone insane? Other people are insane.. Do they know the truth? Why are people stupid? Why do smart people do stupid things? Will tomorrow happen? Why do I forget long term most of what I remember short term? Why do people care so much about random things?

I made a genuine suicide attempt some years ago and ended up intubated for 2 days. I was beyond depressed when I did that. I think I know my own feeling well enough by now. Not that I have to justify it, just sayin‚Äô."
175901698,"I accepted it fully when I was given the diagnosis. I had suspected it for years, like for eleven years before I was diagnosed so, it was like a confirmation of what I already knew.

175901700,i took like 3 to 5 grams of niacin everyday for like 3 years when i learned about _NAME_ mr.hoffer.

175901705,Thanks means alot
175901706,Congratulations. Welcome home
175901707,They stole all my life pretty much. I couldn‚Äôt even be myself. They said they were better than me and I was worthless or insane.
175901708,You would think that nobody cares if you go to the bathroom.
175901709,I'm super excited about the pokeball tho. Might take a walk or something tomorrow with it. Dont know yet. And fiance doesnt know I bought it. He will be upset...
174329394,"It has softened my heart, allowed me to gain faith, and be a better person. Depends on one‚Äôs philosophy though. I think I would take the chance on not having schizophrenia over this."
174329400,Shrooms are worse than weed! They make you violent and cause visual+auditory hallucinations. I took weed when I was on abilify and it was horrible. I had positive symptoms and became violent at the same time. I was about to commit crimes. My parents called 911 and 4 cops came to calme me. They didn‚Äôt leave me until I was seen by a psychiatrist. I was scared that they tase me if I didn‚Äôt listen to them. Don‚Äôt you see news about SZs who take drugs or who stop their meds? A SZ guy killed his mother. Another shot kids in kindergarten and then shot himself. Its horrible.
175901710,"_AT_MENTION_, my friend says to tell you that‚Äôs wonderful information and exactly what she wanted to hear. Thank you!!!"
175901711,My psychiatrist told me that there is a drug in the same family as Abilify but he won‚Äôt try it because it has the same side effects as Abilify according to him. Partial dopamine antagonist unlike non-Abilify meds which are full dopamine antagonists so no lumateperone either.

175901719,"Just fix the issue, get some good treatment. Stop playing around with delusions, they amount to nothing but personal misery in this world."
175901720,I remember dear _AT_MENTION_ who had black skin because he never had shower. Where are you my friend?
175901721,They put me on meds during that whole time i stopped hearing voices but i still believed in bizarre things and i thought they gave me a psychotic disorder diagnosis to protect the people behind my suffering but i guess the meds did their job i accepted i was psychotic after that whole time.
175901722,I‚Äôm an alcoholic and am 61 years old. I‚Äôve gotten drunk numerous times. I‚Äôve been sober 133 days now.

175901725,I guess severe schizophronia means the time where you turn homicidal and end up killing your own self. Hahaha funny right since its over when that happens.

175901735,No problem _AT_MENTION_
175901736,What kind of Information are you looking for? I‚Äôm located in CA and have a bipolar son and it‚Äôs been a long journey getting integrative care covered through our insurance many providers do not accept insurance but they are the ones we have found who are willing to step outside of the traditional treatment plan and approach his care with him as he is not willing to take traditional antipsychotic medications...
175901737,Yeah my pdoc said I could switch the Risperdal to night instead of day and night in case it made me too sedated.
175901738,can you ask them to give them to you in the blisters?
175901739,It sounds like it‚Äôs the side effect of one of the medications. I also have sexual dysfunction and am impotent and don‚Äôt have any desire for sex or even to masturbate. All medications have side effects but you just have to learn to deal with it. Sometimes the side effects go away with time but to me stability of the mind is more important right now than being able to masturbate and have sex. I‚Äôve learned to just accept it and realize that it‚Äôs not going to be perfect because if it‚Äôs not this side effect than it could be something else. Hang in there and good luck!!!

174329392,I'm so sorry for what you two are going through. It's always dangerous not to take your meds especially with such serious conditions. I have a friend who suffers from schizophrenia and without his pills he gets really unpredictable. There is always fear when we don't follow the directions of doctors. I would advise you to talk to your boyfriend and get him to restart his medication. Try to talk honestly and openly to him. I wish the best for you two. Sending you strength.

175901797,"First time here- I developed anxiety with my last promotion to a VP role. It has gotten much worse over the past year. I had my first what I call panic attack last November just before a big budget presentation with the C-suite. Now I find myself in the same panicked state just before any of our calls. I go into a state of panic while preparing and just want to quit my job during these times. Could this be a form of PTSD? And if so how do I resolve? My job is very stressful but I don‚Äôt go into this state of panic unless I‚Äôm on these calls with the president. She asks so many questions that are irrelevant and there‚Äôs no way to prepare for the calls. My fear is not knowing the answers or coming across as incompetent. Part of me feels like the job is too big. I can‚Äôt seem to get my arms wrapped around everything and that causes me anxiety as well.

Every minute was magical, every single thing it did was fascinating and everything it didn't do was equally wondrous, and to be sat there, with a Kestrel, a real live _PERSON_, my own real live _PERSON_ on my wrist! I felt like I'd climbed through a hole in heaven's fence. An introverted, unusual young boy, isolated by his obsessions and a loner at school, _NAME_ was only at home in the fields and woods around his suburban home. But when he stole a young kestrel from its nest, he was about to embark on a friendship that would teach him what it meant to love, and that would change him forever. In his rich, lyrical, and emotionally exposing memoir, _NAME_ brings to life his childhood in the 70s, from his bedroom bursting with fox skulls, birds' eggs, and sweaty jam jars, to his feral adventures. But pervading his story is the search for freedom, meaning, and acceptance in a world that didn‚Äôt understand him. Beautifully wrought, this coming-of-age memo

175901878,Why'd I quit my job? I don't understand why I act on these impulses all the time. It's like a never-ending thing. I need to get a better hang on how to get over impulses.
175901879,"Well of course a lot of stuff has been forgotten, or is buried. But basicalyl I recognize it, also because they are still doing some of the stuff they have been doing 30+ years ago. I can't really decide. You might have seen my topic over in the NPD forum, so this is a current thing actually where I am wondering again why I am not just aborting contact with them. But having some contact still has some practical uses / some minimal monetary ones, and I don't want to be prone to too much black-painting - eventhough that probably makes me prone to white-painting lol. Well a few years ago my mother was basically saying to me that I ""just have to forgive her"" or that ""she is sorry for not having been perfect"" (or something like that). The problem I see is that for them to be forgiven the pressure has to be let out in a way, which also means they would have to be able to actually see what they are or have been doing - which in most cases will not be happening, because they havent worked on themselves 
or on any insight that - for me at least - would be specific enough. What I would expect is basically an explanation of what has been done (or not done), an understanding why it was a problem, some sense of regret or shame and then I might forgive. But just like that based on nothing but some infantile notion? No."

175901882,"Welcome. Truth be told. You aren‚Äôt in a position to appropriately identify how bad or how good your psychotic symptoms are. At best you can identify they have started or that they are about to start. For all people affected, medication is the best first step to functioning. Your delusional symptoms will get controlled and then the rest you have to try fix with your own resilience. Which is perfectly possible for you as is the case with most early stages of psychosis. As above. The fact you have symptoms means that your brain is not functioning ‚Äúnormally‚Äù this means there‚Äôs actually damage happening. You have to get medicated, As for being a student. I‚Äôm the same. And zoom calls I don‚Äôt attend, or I haven‚Äôt attended any this academic year except for one. I have still managed to submit and pass the majority of my electives. You will able to do it when you have recovered from symptoms of psychosis."

174329425,"I feel this. It‚Äôs like personifying schizophrenia. It‚Äôs like this thing that robbed me of my life, do I still have to identify with it? To embrace it? But in the end schizophrenia is a mere physiological phenomenon. There is no deep intelligence to it, just some solvable cause and effect. Any kind of perceived cleverness behind the disorder is your own mind running wild."

174329426,Your intelligence is not necessarily gone. It‚Äôs just smothered with a crapload of internal interference. The negative symptoms also keep you undermotivated. I hope you find a med that can get you back in the game. Otherwise learn your disability options.

174329430,I don‚Äôt think anyone can tell you how long it will take but hopefully the meds will start to do their jobs. There are people here that are on medication and still hear voices so I think that depends on the individual. Sorry I can‚Äôt give you a more definitive answer.

175901922,Oh I hated seroquel for that. And the weight gain. Its impossible to lose weight on seroquel.
175901923,"Thought is usually vocal or visual representations of concepts in mental space. Usually the senses of sound or vision but also on a lesser level tactile too. Taste and olfactory seem to be the weakest. In fact, thoughts may be what creates the physical change - not the other way around. I have some recent interest in this since a couple days ago I discovered that imagining a workout(mostly situps and pushups) actually flexed the relevant muscles in my physical body when I did so. In a very slight way ofcourse. In fact, there have been a few recent studies proving that simply imagining muscle movement actually strengthens those muscles over time. Since I am lazy and have a gut, I am trying to see if I can avoid weight gain by imagining a workout for 20 mins twice a day for a week. So subvocal speech as you say MAY be the physical muscles of your voicebox moving in response to imagined speech. I am currently on Day 4 of my experiment. It will end on Saturday.

If I was normal I'd probably be gainfully productive. I'd like to think I'd be selling paintings in Union Square right now instead of washing my socks in the sink because I only have six pair and I'd rather spend my money on food than buy new ones. I'd still be an oddball, though. At least I hope so. And I wouldn't have a bunch of disorders to cover for that.

174329438,"I‚Äôm glad you decided to give Clozapine a try. You take such huge doses of the other meds, it‚Äôs worth it to try to reduce those. Even if you can‚Äôt eliminate the other drugs, you can at least work with your pdoc to try to find lower effective doses. I suggest calorie counting as a good way to lose weight. Use an online nutrition tracker like My Fitness Pal or the one I use, Sparkpeople. Once you get your favorite foods in your favorites section, you can plan a week‚Äôs worth of meals in about ten minutes. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of time, but it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôve lost 11 pounds in 11 weeks even though I‚Äôm on Zyprexa, which is normally a big weight gain drug. It‚Äôs getting to be second nature to know how much to eat and how much is too much, but I continue to track everything to make sure I‚Äôm on target. I got dizziness when I came off my 30 mg of Haldol. It went away after a week. Hope yours does too. Good luck with the clozapine!"

So I was thinking about this person rudely cause I was mad at them and they started yelling at me for no reason (happened 3 times) and another one was when I was thinking normally and trying to do my class work when I was listening to someone‚Äôs convo and then my intrusive thoughts started harassing me and the people talking then the person talking said something to me (idk what it was) but I know it was something about what ‚ÄúI‚Äù thought. Anyone help?"
175901976,"Wishing to have other illnesses is strange. I have severe depression and it is often crippling. I will always feel depressed. Life isn‚Äôt easy with any mental illness. You have to deal with the cards you are given, instead of wishing for something that you think is better."
174329452,It was difficult. I studied from 2007 to 2010. I had cognitive and negative symptoms since then. The positives came 2 and a half years ago in 2017. Could it be prodromal phase if it happened 10 years ago? I don‚Äôt think so
175901977,Yes I did hallucinate _AT_MENTION_ but on google it says you can have psychotic depression and it lists hallucinations and delusions as symptoms

175902000,Its difficult to achieve as we too many dysfunctional families. So a lot of people never experienced the love of a family.
174329450,"Why my psychiatrist wrote SZ with negative symptoms, apathy and avolition in my diagnosis and work report? He told me there is no meds yet for those. He told me the whole SZ story since antipsychotics came out in 1950. He said doctors noted that not all SZs treated with meds functioned in society. They suffered from negative symptoms and then the negative symptoms category was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders later. Its that book that all psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnesses. Some were able to live with their families without work, money, friends and or a gf; without a life essentially like me. Some were were only able to live in mental hospital but they went into the streets because long hospital stays were stopped. My psychiatrist knows what he‚Äôs talking about and prescribed me Wellbutrin because it helped some with negative symptoms but it only made me worse, sleep 24/7. He said he has no other option because Abilify is the best cor negative symptoms 
and it improved my negative symptoms I had friends BUT I developped serious side effects. https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm"
174329459,I was on Abilify when I finished my university degree. No way I can do that now on Risperdal.
175902001,I think _AT_MENTION_ he seems positive and know how to get on with life
175902002,I get inner voices that constantly interrupt my thinking. The worse/more often they talk the more I engage with them. They usually either say harmful things or completely random and silly things. I also get a high pitched tinnitus thing from time to time as well. Meds make it quiet.
175902003,I don‚Äôt know if this counts. But when people don‚Äôt reply to my sms/texts that sets me off.
175902004,Infections in your hand require medical attention. If the blood flow is limited and the healing is slow you may need antibiotics.

175902006,I prefer younger MH staff and doctors to older (not sure what NP is). They are often more open to new ideas and flexible as well as more polite and easier to deal with too. The better staff I‚Äôve had have tended to be younger.
175902007,Yeah I think so.
174329463,"It can be very difficult being motivated with sz and the meds. Negative symptoms, depression and sedation all work against us and seriously hinder us in doing the things we want and need to do. It sucks."
175902008,"Not interested in being taken to the hospital, lol. That‚Äôs all that‚Äôd come of that. _PERSON_, I wasn‚Äôt talking about anyone here, I didn‚Äôt call anyone anything, I did nothing to you. You‚Äôre entitled to an opinion, but I‚Äôm entitled to thinking that opinion is stupid. Choosing to curse doesn‚Äôt make me less of a human being. Getting my anger out by using the f-bomb isn‚Äôt morally wrong. Better than keeping it inside and then blowing up in someone‚Äôs face. What type of music do you listen to? I like punk rock the most."
174329462,There are other meds out there. Abilify increased my blood sugar but I just take metformin to counteract that and get on with my day. For what it‚Äôs worth seroquel didn‚Äôt work out for me either so I switched meds to abilify. You need to get back on some meds.
175902009,"I think it can, But doesn‚Äôt always. Sometimes great suffering is just great suffering."

175902012,"Glad to hear you are getting help but understand that two weeks must feel so far away. You‚Äôre welcome to message me if you want to vent and I can listen. I also have to work on my negative self talk so I know it‚Äôs not easy. I was given a breathing exercise which helps when I do it. Inhale for four counts, hold for four and exhale for four. Do this 5-6 times. It can help when you‚Äôre feeling anxious but good to do when you‚Äôre not anxious as well."
175902013,My emails texts and related stuff are all very important in determining what I was thinking while psychotic so they are invaluable to me
174329464,? m using since 5 years without problem.there is some kind of limitations but when you consider pros and cons i m definitely i choose this.but of course drugs are very depended on biology.it might affect different people differently.good luck with your search
175902014,i think theres a factor of what you want to be known for as well as to why you are only concerned about the things you are interested in. but as for the being interested in everything i think that maybe people around you just want to see you show some appreciation for what they are doing. since the yard was mowed it makes the house you live in look good so that people who drive by dont think you live at a house where its trashy. you dont have to be interested in everything if everyone was like that then noone would be good at anything because everything would be generalized and people wouldnt be able to spend the time on one thing to become good at it.

175902080,I currently work as a volunteer in an animal shelter nearby with cats and dogs
175902081,I have entire conversations that may have been in my head or that may have been actual conversations.
175902082,Alright. Thanks. I love yall
175902084,"right now I have 3 diets I‚Äôve come up with. at the moment, I‚Äôve been eating 2100 calories a day with about 130-150 grams of protein. I also have a bulking diet when im trying to gain weight where I eat 3100 calories and 160 grams of protein. and when Im trying to get shredded and ripped I eat 1700 calories, mostly protein, with some carbs to fuel my cardio workouts. I weigh 160 pounds, or 70 something kg. would like to be 170 pounds with a 6 pack, but at the moment im just focusing on getting stronger. I will probably allow my weight to fluctuate between 155-185 pounds for a year or two while im trying to add lean muscle. but eventually I would like to be 170 pounds. once I‚Äôve added muscle and strength I will transition to a pescatarian diet for maintenance dieting."
175902085,"Early on, my voices were both bizarre and incredibly negative and ugly. I feel for all of you. The voices can be super hard to endure. Especially until you find a treatment than calms them down. Even now, I still hear them. But now they are pretty mellow compared to what I used to hear."
175902086,_AT_MENTION_ It is never good to generalize and women get sz bad too. Please also consider posting your theories in threads that are to help others. I would think it‚Äôs confusing to someone coming out of delusions to be bombarded with yet others. It‚Äôs easy to get lost chasing shadows and most of us have been there but sometimes you need to let go of the fanciful.
174329467,"I feel the exact same thing, I wonder if it is part of Schizophrenia."

174329486,"I started on risperdone. I was on that for 5 years. When I started risperdone I got BIG motivation issues for about 3 years). After about 3 years of risperdone I kind of got my ass in gear (i.e. join the gym/quit smoking/quit drinking/lost weight etc). I just grew sick and tired of being sick and tired all of the time and started living more healthy. In addition to risperdone I have been on geodon and now I‚Äôm on abilify. Risperdone was the heavy hitter IMO. Completing a workout on geodon or abilify has NEVER been an issue, but it was on risperdone. IMO some meds are worse than others with feeling unmotivated. But there are other factors that are in your control that can make you feel better. I have found diet and exercise will do more for your motivation than any med change. OMG there‚Äôs so much‚Ä¶"

For some babies inclusion means everything for them- including fighting for their lives. The medications for some of them are not developed and many children are dying because of it; I think that is why inclusion is so important."

174329481,"There‚Äôs is only some truth to this. According to some, some of the medication (particularly older or potent types of a certain action) are known to cause certain cognitive dysfunctions (or there‚Äôs more appropriate language to use than that word). For the most part, just having symptoms is a sign that you are already dealing with a brain which isn‚Äôt normal or that is, dysfunctional. It‚Äôs likely the meds which cause frontal lobe problems (olanzipine is documented to do this) are not causing permanent damage, or it is reversible. When I was first put on antipsychotics ‚Äî I noticed a lot of things got worse for me and it was (I suspect the olanzipine), at the time I did not hear voices or experience paranoia; I only experience disordered thinking and illogical or confusion between real and false. I developed memory issues, cholesterol issues, apathy and maybe other things too. But for the most part, partial antagonist abilify has worked fine for me. It really depends on the medication and also 
how it is used as well as when and with who. If you are worried with your current antipsychotic you HAVE to communicate this by researching as much as you can. If the dr or nurse is not listening, you MUST seek a change in professionals. The only way to make partial or workable recovery from this illness is to take back as much cognitive control as possible; this starts and is demonstrated by how actively you can pursue normal activities ‚Äî including dealing with your health care and providers.

spending time with my ex during the day. If I lived in my own place, likely I would be over here with him anyway not over there by myself. This Place is a bit of a mess but I could do more organizing and cleaning. I have all that furniture I already bought for the new place, but I could incorporate some of it here and just continue to store the rest of it. I have a lot of kitchen items I bought that I could unpack and put in the kitchen and use, so that would get them out of boxes in the bedroom and make room. Or I could continue with my plan of moving and buy all new stuff and go desperately into debt and be alone all the time.

If you can avoid it, don‚Äôt bring junk foods into the house and then you won‚Äôt be tempted. My husband is doing Sparkpeople with me so we only bring in foods that fit into our calorie goals. It‚Äôs too hard to resist when you have the wrong foods around. Sometimes when you live with others who are not trying to lose, you can‚Äôt avoid it though. You can also eat within a good range when you go out. Not necessarily at fast food places, but I have learned what fits into my good nutrition in our favorite restaurants. I have a southwestern tofu wrap that I adore, and there i

I watched a lot and researched a lot on the matter and her remorse and guilt has settled in. She‚Äôs showing a lot of promise and we‚Äôre both working everything through. The biggest hurdle for me is trying to figure out how to get my mind over knowing that someone out there has taken the one thing that I thought my wife and I would share for the rest of our lives. Night time is the worst. My mind races and plays tricks on me all the time. I‚Äôm so insecure about all the little things. For example, I was trying to make out with her and she didn‚Äôt want to make out with me. I asked how come she wouldn‚Äôt and then she says ,‚Äù well making out leads to other things and tonight‚Äôs not a good night‚Äù. So immediately my mind says. Well, is that how it started? She started making out with this AHole home wrecker and one thing lead to another?? I‚Äôve kept myself from asking too many hurtful deta

I asked my psychiatrist to take me off Olanzapine because I gained so much weight on it so he put me on Abilify which was a whole other story. Olanzapine is quite effective. Maybe you just need time.

175902212,Hi everyone. I am on risperidal consta and am on citaprolam (antidepressant). I want to get off my antidepressant and take St. _NAME_‚Äôs Wort instead. My dr said it‚Äôs not recommended to take citaprolam and St. _NAME_‚Äôs Wort. She also said she doesn‚Äôt know how SJW would interact with my risperidal consta.

Are/were you good? Any insight would be helpful. Thanks!

When I smoked weed one time I felt like everyone was looking at me on the train and I was constantly hearing voices which were harrasing me calling me names, while this was happening I took the train in the complete opposite direction where I need to go, I switched trains several times and I didnt know where I was going as my memory kept going blank, I then thought the people working with trains were after me so I took off in some place I didn't know where I was, I then I was getting chased by a gang so ran into a pub and told them to call the police, the police came and asked for description but I didn't know what as scared as I was I asked be taken by the police to the station I then thought they followed and didn't want to leave, I repeatedly called me cousin and told him what happe
ned and he told me I was being delusional but atm I didn't think I was I told stay on the phone and he did so I went and got the bus but I still thought they were following till as soon of I got of the bus I sprinted to his house however for the next 2 days I felt they were trying to break into get me after that whole episode past I went back to uni however started to have titinitus and a headache that wouldnt go, I couldn't concentrate in any lectures and I kept feeling like I was out my body as if I just wasn't there, I started to withdraw from friend not leaving my accommodation for days at the same time I kept hearing this voice saying come outside stop hiding you ***** and there would be a girl that would instagate and call me names, knowing something was I had leave and come home. I tried to get get help from a mh team but it seemed like no one was trying to help me. When I got home I started hearing two other voices speaking in Dutch constantly saying you're a ******, your family thinks you're gay haha 
you're gay, they would comment on everything I would do and say I was gay. I then proceed to think my family was spying on me and that there were camera in my room and I would my sister cry saying he's gay look at him, look at way his laying down which lasted for a few weeks.

175902273,As we all suffer from anxiety I find it difficult to align myself with what is really important in life. With Covid abounding and so many people suffering and dying I am taken aback with the lack of understanding and caring we now experience in the world today. I now devote much of my time thinking about what I say and do with the time I have left. I have more years behind me than in front of me so I cant afford to waste one minute of my life. I am trying to cultivate more friendships and devote more time for others yet with Covid I cant do the simple things I really would love to do. Just sharing time talking with friends or having lunch with my church group is out of the question now. Too many of the younger people refuse to wear masks and I don't want to expose myself unnecessarily. I can of course call people on the phone but its different than spending time with people in person. I believe people crave that personal approach and being able to bond with others makes both my life and theirs so mu
ch better. I know so many people who are lonely. They want to be with others. They need the human touch. I have experienced firsthand a situation which has forever changed my life. My father in law always was a hard working no nonsense type of person. He never had time for people and only cared about making money. Then his life fell apart and he lost his son and wife within a few years of each other. This has completely changed who he is as he now complains about being lonely. I feel hurt for all the years I tried to be friendly to him as I married his daughter yet he refused to devote the time and energy to cultivate relationships as his business was the most important thing to him. Now he wants my wife and myself to spent every minute with him as he is now alone. I have a real problem with this as I feel so hurt from the years of him not caring for his own child and by extension myself. Life throws us all such hard situations and we must adapt our life around them. I am so thankful for my faith and pray I c
an arise to the needs of others even when they are painful to me. God bless you all

I have quite a few friends but no time to try to connect and build actual relationships. I am so so lucky that I have a part time job that offers me some social connection. I have a lot of responsibilities at home and helping my ill mother so there isn‚Äôt much time for social interaction outside of work. Honestly with everything going on at home it‚Äôs left me wondering if I should quit my job but aside from needing pay, I couldn‚Äôt imagine going back to the isolation I was in before it. I used to do lots of volunteer work and hope to get back to it some day but I can‚Äôt be out of the house anymore than I already am so I still have times where I feel very isolated."

175902383,"Welcome to the forum. Does your mother know about this? You could put together a care plan for her and talk to a psychiatrist and professionals. Although they tried to make me suicidal and made me cut my feet I was never really suicidal. There are out patient get togethers. I didn‚Äôt want to go and maybe you have to be stable and well enough to want to go to such and be able to get yourself there. Can she take care of her own hygiene? Shower, brush teeth , grocery shopping etc‚Ä¶? A care plan should be made for her with or without her approval if she is suicidal. Intervention. Action. I was depressed n severe apathy with suicidal thoughts etc as a child . Then around twenty I was hospitalised. Got a touch better and then few or couple years later hospital again. I was my worst when I was out of hospital. I lied or didn‚Äôt tell my dr my symptoms because I didn‚Äôt want more medication or to be hospitalised. I heard voices , gun shots, screams, moans 24/7 for years. It was torture along with delusi
ons. I could barely buy food or leave apartment and would scream at the voices etc. After years of torture the voices stopped. I was doing well for awhile off medication but then I got delusions again. No voices this time just delusions but they made me stop eating and drinking as I thought the water was poisoned so I got dehydrated and couldn‚Äôt take care of myself. My dad took me to hospital. I didn‚Äôt tell Dr my delusions. I had delusions for a while then got better and my boyfriend I had made me take a higher dose of medication and when I did my delusions went away. I have been stable since despite leaving that boyfriend and his dogs who are my family I miss and want back. I am still fragile and need to avoid stress and triggers and am thankfully on the pension. I am able to function good enough for myself. I‚Äôm proud of the little I do. Maybe she needs medication or increased medication or medication change. Medication has helped me. Medication can take away suicidal thoughts. Talk to professionals. T
ake action. Her life can improve. She can smile again. I had years with no laughter ever. Now I‚Äôm able to laugh. Not often but it happens."

175902385,"I‚Äôve been with Mr. Star for over 5 years, married for 3 on Monday. We just started fostering kids together. My advice is to always clearly communicate your needs, but take responsibility for them as much as you can. Taking proper care of yourself is one of the best gifts you can both give each other. If both of you put your own needs first, you‚Äôll be well rested and better able to help each other when you really need it. And remember to distinguish between needs and wants. For example: I need Mr. Star to take the kids for an hour or two each day so I can go do social things with no kids. If I don‚Äôt get that time, my temper flares and I‚Äôm not able to be as patient as I want with the kids. I also WANT him to take out the garbage every time, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm perfectly capable of doing on my own. It doesn‚Äôt hurt me to take out the garbage. It only inconveniences me."

The group started to bully the one friend and set everyone in class up against her. I sticked with her and refused to join the bullying. After this it crossed over to me a bit too, though more in the sense of being left out (and not really being sure if i wanted to be ‚Äúin‚Äù with such people). I got depressed, insecure and developped trust issues. The single friend clung to me so badly, claiming and copying me, that it also wasnt healthy. She dropped me when i finally spoke up about that once, after a few years. So i was lonely and drifted off from other people, more than really being bullied. I wasnt exactly an extravert too, which didnt help much. I felt more bullied at home though. I fled into the arms of a somewhat psychopathic drug-abusing boyfriend. Him and his friends ‚Äúaccepted me as i was‚Äù. Best move ever."

175902450,Yay! This is great news! I am so pleased to hear that it went better than anticipated. This is one of those situations that you can draw upon in the future to combat catastrophic thinking. Remembering that things don't turn out to be the worst case scenario like our anxiety would lead us to believe is a helpful tool! It is great that you have this situation where things turned out better than expected to look back on. S.C. ..

175902452,"Thank you so much _NAME_. So far my drs have given me Amitriptyline and duloxetine to help combat the anxiety. My anxiety causes stomach and intestinal pain. Amitriptyline was given for this. I have degenerative disc disease which causes most of my daily pain. I get to chose either the amitriptyline or duloxetine for my anxiety but not both to be taken daily. Honestly neither has helped with my anxiety. I am looking for a psychiatrist to try to get help with all this. My primary dr and pain management dr mean well but I just don't feel anxiety is something they can treat well. I just feel a specialist would be better for this. I had a two level fusion about four years ago but would not recommend this treatment as I have more pain now than before. Because of the degenerative disc disease I need further fusions as more discs are degrading. I can deal with the pain somewhat but my anxiety is sucking the life out of me. I need to get this under control. As we age we lose serotonin levels so maybe this 
is whats going on. I just don't enjoy things I have always loved to do in the past. I am always rushing to finish anything I start. I move from one thing to another quickly. I seem to have lost patience especially when reading. I am not mean or vocal in any way. I don't lose my temper I just feel unsettled most of the time. _NAME_, I see you are taking Citalopram with good results. Did you try many meds before settling on this one? Any advice would be appreciated. Did you go to a psychiatrist? I just don't feel my normal self any longer. I stay away from the news as almost everything upsets me. My wife says I am going to have a heart attack or stroke. I would love to hear about any meds anyone is taking and any advice for helping with anxiety. I want to say thank you for any help. I am a giving person myself but now I just need some understanding and wisdom to get me headed in the right direction. Thank you all for your support. Bless you all."

You don't have to snap it hard. My adult son is Bipolar and has borderline schizophrenia and when he was young we tried this when his medication wasn't helping. This actually helped quite a bit. His therapist and Dr were impressed. I used to see things that weren't there. Not sure why, but mostly animals. It could be a moth on a wall, or a mouse run across the room, ect.

175902535,"Hello there I'm _NAME_, in my late thirties. I was always qualified as a ""tranquil strength"". Sure, i was often worried about school performance, about other's perception of me, about this and that. But it didn't prevent to move on, to rest, to have adventures. Nonetheless, some anxiety about the future started to pile up, as my parents grew older, my mom retired, many of my younger cousins started to have families while i was single. But the tippoint point was two years ago, when i took my first real job in the corporate world, and in a new industry, in a new city where i didn't want to live. I had a panic attack in the plane when i went for my interview. One month before my expatriation, i started to have extrasystoles, did exams, doc didn't see anything, and it went away after a few days. And during those two years, i had several physical manifestations of anxiety, and/or anxiety being created by physical problems: sore throat for 6 months, some kind of reflux, heartburn, etc. And every 6 mont
hs, a panick attack. Always the same routine, i go to E.R., do blood checks & all, nothing to report. Now i came back to my home country, but still away from my family. Intense job. Lockdown, a bit alone. And in a downward spiral, my mind is focusing on some kind of heartburn/GERD that is becoming permanent (see thread: https://www.healingwell.com/community/default.aspx?f=45&m=4237333#gsc.tab=0), and every symptoms increase the anxiety, the fear boost the symptoms and prevent me to go see a doctor as i'm afraid of invasive exams. Every night, even if i elevate my head, i feel a discomfort, a weight in my chest/belly, even if i do stretching, yoga, eat well... and the mind is focusing on it, and have difficulties letting go, to sleep, afraid that this problem is something bad, that i won't wake up. In other words, this situation starts to be super annoying and a hindrance, preventing me to take the plane now, or the boat, or any situation that would make me self-aware of being stranded from civilization, from 
a doctor, etc. Your concrete advice would be much appreciated, thanks Post Edited (AlexSante90) : 2/14/2021 1:36:35 PM (GMT-7)"

175902554,"I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs out of the question, just that if there is someone who made everything, they obviously set it into motion and then went with a hands-off approach. Therefore, while it‚Äôs not out of the question to believe in such an entity, such beliefs shouldn‚Äôt be used to define what we do with our time here on earth. It‚Äôs just my own personal philosophy. To that end, death should be treated as something final and bleak, which for example justifies punishing murderers instead of just saying ‚Äúoh, the victims are in heaven now.‚Äù My relationship with anything spiritual begins and ends with Near Death Experiences. They cheer me up and give me hope but don‚Äôt put any pressure on me to behave a certain way. Talking with your dad about it might be a good idea but just try not to allow any of it to seep into your disorder and give you religious delusions. You‚Äôve gotta be able to handle it the way a totally sane person would, just separate it from your daily life. My stepdad told me to 
pray at one point. I felt just like you did, how can he so comfortably offer a solution to something he hasn‚Äôt experienced?

Yes, fibromyalgia causes pain and it‚Äôs not unusual for fibromyalgia patients to have pain. If it is not severe, it may not be CRPS (complex regional pain syndrome). Do you have nerve damage or have you had nerve damage? I would say watch out for a while and if it still is bothersome, you should probably talk to a doctor. Blessings."

175902562,"It sounds like you've really built yourself a great foundation to manage your health. Do they have daily group therapy there? What do you mean by the term ""tense""? Do you mean anxiety? If that's the case, it would ruin me as well. I lean on alcohol in those trying wintery times. I don't recommend that of course, it's my own weakness bleeding through. Does thus tenseness just come about situational or biological? What are your recent med changes? Does it feel like an internal restlessness where you have to keep on tapping your feet as you feel like you want to crawl out of your skin? If that's the case, it might be akathasia, which is an awful side-effect from AP's. All it takes usually is a pill called Cogentin. It's very cheap generic drug that costs maybe 6 bucks a month where I from. If it is not internal restlessness (akathasia) then the first line of treatment for panic and anxiety is an SSRI or SNRI. FOr some reason I recall that you're on one, maybe you could raise the dosage?"

I took a long nap when I got back to the hotel and feel a bit better. I chewed a nicotine gum for the first time in 10 days.. I have sinned!! But I'll chew them rarely - They're just so good for focus (I don't advise). I put 10mg of dextroamphetamine under my tongue after my nap - Veins are kinda big which worries me.

We discussed the life of chemistry a bit and also had a modern _USER_ID_ on a traditional Turkish drink, whose name I forget, but which is basically a type of Indian lassie. I say modern because they had added probiotics to make it more like Yakult. The meal was lovely, but then I brought up the images of Syria I had seen and asked her if she knew anything about it. She really cursed me out as a nobody and when I left I heard her psychic voice say, ‚ÄúI thought you were someone important‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt find you attractive‚Äù.

If I didn't take the Lithium stabilizer, then then when I took the anti-depressant alone, it would send my mania through the roof and I might have panic attacks, also. So I have to take both of those meds. You're having a difficult time, and I'm doing relatively well. I wonder why? Could it be, I'm on my medicine and you're not? You say, ""having to go off my meds and on again I have Bipolar type 1."" Why do you have to go off your medicines? Then you say, ""The last two years have been super hectic for me. Starting with getting pregnant, having to go off my meds and on again"" and loss of job, etc. I'll guess, with the pregnancy you had to go off your medicine. You say you ""turn to cannabis oil ( legal over

And ""I don‚Äôt really feel like I have any support, except for my therapist, which I see once a month over WhatsApp. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing my crap, spiraling downward.""

You can look up my previous posts to see what I have tried. These supplements did something for me, but it did not even come close to nicotine (which seems to increase acetylcholine)!

There are lot of stories that nicotine is addictive, while I‚Äôm not suggesting it is not, it does help me very much so far! Heck, caffeine is also addictive. So I came to the conclusion that if used in small amounts, there is not much that can go wrong. And so I just tried it out. I have done a fair amount of research on the topic, there is some researc

In a previous study, significant improvements in negative and cognitive symptoms were observed in a group of 21 schizophrenic patients receiving high-dose glycine in addition to antipsychotic treatment. This study evaluated the degree to which symptom improvements might be re

Glycine treatment was associated with an 8-fold increase in serum glycine levels, similar to that observed previously. A significant 34% reduction in negative symptoms was observed during glycine treatment. Serum antipsychotic levels were not significantly altered.

Schizophrenia clinically manifests with acute episodes which are associated with hallucinations, delirium, behavioral disorders and a variable range of chronic persistent symptoms, which can be debilitating. The causes of schizophrenia are not clearly understood. It seems that genetic factors may produce a vulnerability to schizophrenia, along with environmental factors that contribute in 
a different way from individual to individual. In this context schizophrenia constitutes the outcome of a complex interaction between multiple genes and environmental risk factors, none of which on its own causes the disorder itself. Antipsychotic medications represent the first line of psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia. But there is a growing body of evidence that omega-3 fatty acids can prevent the disease or at least mitigate the course and symptoms. Probably, an appropriate dietary supplementation can play a partially therapeutic effect, even in more severe patients, improving some behavioral aspects and, mainly, reducing the cognitive deterioration. In this context the role of omega-3 fatty acids as a treatment for schizophrenia will strengthen the thrust of researchers and clinicians to the integrated approach to the prevention and cure of a disease that for more than a century challenging researchers. 3000mg - 4000mg per day Vitamin d PubMed Central (PMC) Correlation between total vitamin D level

The key aspects utilized were ""Psychotic Disorders AND Nitric Oxide"", ""Psychosis AND Nitric Oxide"",""Schizotypal Personality Disorder AND Nitric Oxide"", ""Delusional Disorder AND Nitric Oxide"", ""Brief Psychotic Disorder AND Nitric Oxide"", ""Schizophreniform Disorder AND Nitric Oxide"", ""Schizoaffective Disorder AND Nitric Oxide"", and ""Schizophrenia AND Nitric Oxide"". Empirical works utilizing human subjects, published in the last 10 years, in English language were included.Initially, the search yielded a total of 95 studies. Then, 39 were elected according to the inclusion requirements. The selected articles were divided into five groups: biochemical studies (n=15; 38.5%), genetic studies (n=11; 28.2%), postmortem studies (n=6; 15.4%), clinical trials 
(n=6; 15.4%), and case reports (n=1; 2.5%). The studies evaluated only schizophrenic or schizoaffective disorder subjects. The great majority of them found evidence of nitric oxide dysfunctions in psychosis.The results of the review strengthen the idea that nitric oxide has a key participation in psychotic disorders and deserves deeper investigation as a target for future pharmacological intervention. There is a link between psychosis and too much nitric oxide. All I can say is that high doses vitamins and fats work for me."

175902772,"Hi guys, I‚Äôll try to get my point across clearly, here goes: Basically considering what works and feels best with relating to my voices I find it is basically good to trust them in order to hear them correctly. For me they are a constant in my life, they vary in intensity and presence but ultimately when in certain moments they always appear. By believing them at face value I hear their tone more clearly and it is easier to discern what they are implying and why they are hinting at certain things. It‚Äôs easier to be assertive when I can hear the enemy more clearly. If I reject them outright or try to suppress them I do not get a clear understanding of what they imply and this causes me to take the opposite which is not good. If the direction they propose by chance happens to be the right direction and I take the opposite ‚Äújust bcos‚Äù then I‚Äôm hurting myself. Put another way it is like my inner voice is fused with other voices. If i try to suppress the other voices it suppresses my voice as 
well and that leaves me vulnerable. But when I allow them to influence me I can spot more quickly when they are leading me astray. I can also spot more clearly when they are helping or when they are just mimicking the right way. Basically I believe that if I relate to my voices well it becomes just as easy to live with them as it is to live with my own inner voice. The voices have also become a counter-weight on my conscience and just blindly rejecting them on short notice leaves me shaky. Mods, please flag if this post is unhelpful."

175902803,"You always write beyond my reading-attention-span limits, so I may well come back on other points later, when I can give them the time they deserve. This is a good point and presents us with the notion of group-schizoid psychology. If an individual displays magical thinking and association with fanciful ideas, then they'd be classed as schizoid, but religion represents mass-schizoid behaviour. If religion didn't exist today we'd never create it, because it would be obvious to the population familiar with the movement of the sun and moon that it's all bollocks. But, people believe it, not just to the point where it makes them feel better, but to the point where they'll use it to guide their lives. If someone was to present that idea to a doctor unfamiliar with religion, they'd definitely class it as schizoid. People invent a a narrative to fit their lives around, and here's why: people want to believe. It's almost a driving need. We need to believe in something. For some it's religion, for others it
's politics or feminism, or black lives matter or save the whales etc. Nothing is done in moderation. If we believe in something it becomes a defining trait. If we think blacks and whites are the same, we won't just treat them the same, we'll tear down statues and attack the police (including the black ones). _NAME_ Faith told us that there's a god-shaped hole in all of us, and she suggested that we all seek god in our own way. I think that it's more general than that. I think there's a need in all of us to rationalise our lives; to give our life purpose. It's hard for most to accept that life is a thin sliver of light sandwiched between eternal dark, so this ""god-shaped hole"" is a need for us to create a bigger story around our essentially pointless existence. Truth is, we don't know what reality is. If we look at life at a sub-atomic level, we're just a consciousness carried by projected energy. So, anything we create as a ""truth"" that guides our lives is schizoid, because it has no foundation of eviden
ce behind it. Isn't that what magical thinking and fanciful day-dreaming is all about? You're only schizoid if your fantasy isn't the same as everyone else. Why is this? Brain-washing. Brain washing always sounds sinister, with visions of deluded cults dragging teenagers off to camps to indoctrinate them with their ideas. But, brain-washing isn't a binary thing. Brain-washing is simply a constructive process that uses mechanisms that we use to learn, but done in a way that exaggerates the effect. But the behaviours and mechanics of brain-washing are used by everyone every day. It's called conditioning. Parents use it with their kids. It's no coincidence that most Christians live in certain countries and Buddhists live in others, because we indoctrinate our children with our ideas and they grow up believing that these ideas are their own. It's not just religion, it's everything. Political ideals, racism, social factors etc, they're all built via conditioning. And, if someone can't rationalise something they're 
conditioned for then they ""rebel"" and create their own story to counter it, which they attach to in the same obsessive manner. The more I read about schizoid behaviour, the more normal and rational it seems."

Sociopaths and psychopaths are not the only people whose primary relationship is with themselves.

Arguably, only insofar as people are mentally healthy can they even perceive let alone value another human being.

174329631,"Abstract While the roots of mania and melancholia can be traced to the 18th century and earlier, we have no such long historical narrative for dementia praecox (DP). I, here, provide part of that history, beginning with _PERSON_‚Äôs chapter on Verr√ºcktheit for his 1883 first edition textbook, which, over the ensuing 5 editions, evolved into _PERSON_‚Äôs mature concepts of paranoia and paranoid DP. That chapter had 5 references published from 1865 to 1879 when delusional-hallucinatory syndromes in Germany were largely understood as secondary syndromes arising from prior episodes of melancholia and mania in the course of a unitary psychosis. Each paper challenged that view supporting a primary Verr√ºcktheit as a disorder that should exist alongside mania and melancholia. The later authors utilized faculty psychology, noting that primary Verr√ºcktheit resulted from a fundamental disorder of thought or cognition. In particular, they argued that, while delusions in mania and melancholia were secondary, 
arising from primary mood changes, in Verr√ºcktheit, delusions were primary with observed changes in mood resulting from, and not causing, the delusions. In addition to faculty psychology, these nosologic changes were based on the common-sense concept of understandability that permitted clinicians to distinguish individuals in which delusions emerged from mood changes and mood changes from delusions. The rise of primary Verr√ºcktheit in German psychiatry in the 1860‚Äì1870s created a nosologic space for primary psychotic illness. From 1883 to 1899, _PERSON_ moved into this space filling it with his mature diagnoses of paranoia and paranoid DP, our modern-day paranoid schizophrenia.

175902997,"Here's one way psychosis can be in some way, art.. I wrote something to do with god, planets, aliens, etc.. (When I was psychotic in 2017 (21 years old) - When I was moderated on here) and I wrote down symbols in a circle.. I kept writing down each symbol and every time I did, I connected them together.. Until I made 9 symbols.. I connected them all together.. I realized to myself, ""Holy ****ing ****.. I remember learning this in school.. It's the 9 divisibility rule in mathematics"".. Honestly, to say, it was brilliant. It made me realize how much of a trippy matrix dream of a life we're in.. That and the paradox that I was obsessed with when I was 16.. I remember when I was a kid, I was walking and thought of people in my head looking through my eyes and controlling my movements with a control system and steering wheel... It must have been an aspie thing.. It's all very interesting stuff and meant something very important to me at the time.. I wish I kept the paper with the symbols on it because 
it was so cool.. I ripped it up and threw it away because I didn't want anyone to see and think that I needed to end up back in the psych ward... And that's why the woman in the psych ward was talking about how important the number 9 was.. (She would count to 9 and tell me things about the numbers..) She said she was stupid and I was seemed to be too ""INTP"" (Which is what I think she meant I guess) and I was smart but I ""See the truth"" or something a little bit (She was asking people questions and she was saying to some people ""You have it too a little bit!"" and they were all different questions.. She did card tricks with me and I was amazed/or psychotic) and should do meth like she did to make me a bit stupid because she said her being stupid is ok... She was the most psychotic person I've ever met (Stupid has nothing to do with it) but I was psychotic in 2017 because of the meth and MDMA.."

175903055,"Thank you for your reply, Oblivion. Yes, I think you are right. It would be more a form of empathy than an emotion. Interestingly, my schizoid friend seems innately more considerate and more empathetic than I. Could it be that his ability to empathize has been strengthened because he cannot experience positive emotions (he can experience negative ones)? He also describes himself as a sociopath, yet corresponding with him is making me a better person, despite my own sociopathic tendencies. Thank you for sharing about Toe. Although you say, 'He's ice cold, selfish and unemotional.', your words telling about him radiate warmth and love, at least to me. Are you aware of that? They feel a lot like the words my schizoid friend uses when he has occasionally mentioned his mother. At such times, his words feel soft and warm, like they're smiling . 'reminds us of some aspect of ourselves we are either ashamed of or don't want to face' Seriously, I could easily see myself doing that, because I don't hold back 
in our correspondence and say some incredibly foolish things which I would never risk saying to someone less in touch with themselves than he. Here's a further question: My friend has frequently mentioned 'inserting (him)self' into a character in a song or novel. I wonder whether he might insert himself into my 'character' in order to experience some of the things I talk about. Do you think that's at all likely, or would it be too 'close', because I'm alive and, at this point, less likely to be able to pass as a form of artificial intelligence? No, you're not going around in circles. Thank you for your reply, salles. I agree that, 'it is more a form of empathy than an emotion'. But you've clarified an important point. Actually, frequently, my friend and I perceive the same objective situation in markedly different ways. When we have discussed our sometimes diametrically opposing views, one of the surprising outcomes has been that both 'sides' end up seeming equally valid. Our correspondence has, at least temp
orarily , opened my mind. It feels a little bit like becoming equally comfortable reading upside-down."

175903060,"In late winter of 2019, I qualified for an emotional support animal through the student mental health services at the university I was attending at the time. Both the doctor and I agreed that I would benefit from having something to care for other than myself. Most days, the only reason I get up is because I have to work. (Luckily I feel the responsibility of earning money and the guilt of letting down co-workers by calling off to keep going.) But nothing else really matters to me. I don't feel like showering, I am happier existing in my dreams than being awake. I love animals and really thought an ESA would be great. The decade before I was very involved with training and caring for my parents' dogs, and it helped me. Living on my own, I felt like I struggled to have a purpose besides school and work. Weekends and holidays we spent mostly in bed. I have since graduated and now living in a pet friendly apartment. The problem I am having is that I have tried to get a pet, but immediately begin havin
g panic attacks that get increasingly worse. The last time, I couldn't eat, was shaking and couldn't stop crying. I love dogs, but I would have given anything that day to make him go away.

175903061,"Ha no. The most normal of the siblings who has never had any issues mental or substance use wise is my oldest younger brother. It‚Äôs scary how stable that boy is. He has a lot of talents and makes himself handy. Second place is probably my 2nd younger brother. He was weiiiird as a kid and had a lot of issues, and some mild depression as a teen, and he got into vaping and weed and drinking. He quit vaping though and only smokes weed and drinks occasionally now. Aside from that he is now very, very normal. Kind of boringly so. Is in a business frat, majoring in finance or something related. Has always done pretty well in school. I was an absolute hot mess for the longest time but amazingly kept up outward appearances for the most part and did decently well in school, got stable and pretty happy. My youngest younger brother is still pretty much a hot mess, unapologetic drug user, pothead, has struggled w major depression, hospitalizations & I suspect possibly psychosis in the past, pathologic liar, s
teals money from my parents, has been failing classes and almost being held back since forever, etc. He is definitely the hottest mess of the family. My little sisters are still too young to tell. I hope they end up ok happy and as normal as someone from our family could be. My mom has been falling apart lately. My dad has grown into an amazing person compared to who he was when I was growing up, but he is an absolute ball of stress. That about sums it up."

174329667,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Lateral ventricular size in schizophrenia: relationship to the disease process and its clinical manifestations. _PERSON_, EC _PERSON_, _PERSON_, CD _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychological medicine , Feb 1985 Using computed tomography, lateral ventricular size was studied in a sample of 112 institutionalized chronic schizophrenic patients (selected from 510 cases to investigate the correlates of the defect state and intellectual decline and the effects of insulin, electroconvulsive and neuroleptic treatment), and compared with matched groups of non-institutionalized schizophrenics, patients with first schizophrenic episodes, institutionalized and non-institutionalized patients with primary affective disorder, and neurotic out-patients. Age was significantly correlated (P less than 0.0002) with lateral ventricular size, but the institutionalized schizophrenic patients had significantly larger (P less than 0.025) lateral ventricles than the neurotics when age was taken into acc
ount. Ventricular enlargement was unrelated to past physical treatment (neuroleptics, insulin coma and electroconvulsive therapy). Within the group of institutionalized schizophrenic patients few correlates of ventricular enlargement were identified; thus in this population increased ventricular size was not clearly associated with the features of the defect state (negative symptoms and intellectual impairment). However, there was a curvilinear (inverted-U) relationship between intellectual function and ventricular size. Increased ventricular size was significantly related to absence of hallucinations, impairment of social behaviour, inactivity and the presence of abnormal involuntary movements. The findings confirm that structural brain changes do occur in chronic schizophrenia, but illustrate some of the difficulties in elucidating the clinical significance of ventricular enlargement. Lateral ventricular size is strongly age-related and the distribution in chronic schizophrenia is skewed and not bimodal; th
e relationship to particular features of the disease is complex and likely to emerge only in studies with a large sample size."

They found that persistently high insulin levels from mid-childhood were linked with a higher chance of developing psychosis in adulthood. In addition, they found that an increase in BMI around the onset of puberty, was linked with a higher chance of developing depression in adulthood, particularly in girls.

175903089,"It may sound like I‚Äôm being super hard on myself, but I really am better when I have a routine. Part of the problem is I‚Äôve gone back to worrying about my sexual dysfunction. I‚Äôve only had one sexual relationship in my life, at the age of thirty three, seven years ago, and it only lasted six months. This used to bother me a lot. But once I had the relationship, I calmed down loads on worrying about lack of experience. The relationship had a lot of love, but was very dysfunctional. My girlfriend at the time also had SZ, which both helped and hindered the relationship. After that I basically gave up on having any sexual relationships, though pursued a lot of Platonic ones with women, which made me feel loved in a comforting and stable way. The fact that none of these developed into sexual relationships was all down to my sexual dysfunction, and if I wasn‚Äôt sexually dysfunctional they easily could have. Giving up on sex is fine with me, except that part of me would love to have a family, thoug
h there is no way I could cope with that at the moment. Getting to the stage where I could start a family is one of the motivations for me in trying to better myself and my situation, but its not an obsession, it will happen when it happens if it is meant to be. As I said, I feel better when I have a routine, and I‚Äôm really sick of dwelling on how dysfunctional I am sexually, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seemed to go back to these last few days. Sexual dysfunction was a big part of my psychosis, and I‚Äôm worried that if I don‚Äôt address it, it will take over my life again, though on the other hand if I do address it then it is already taking over my life. I just want to get back into my routine and not think about it, as I was doing before, which is the healthiest I have been. Thank you."

These potential biomarkers would be fundamental players in the diagnosis, stratification, prognosis and therapeutic orientation in addiction. Due to growing evidence of the involvement of the immune system in addiction and psychiatric disorders, we tested the hypothesis that patients with CUD in abstinence might have altered circulating levels of signaling proteins related to systemic inflammation. = _NAME_,#1 _PERSON_,#1 _NAME_,#1 et all."

175903168,I‚Äôve been on Paxil for 19 years. I keeps giving me the feeling I can feel good and if circumstances fall into place and i do my share it keeps me doing better. But I sleep at night too.

175903180,I sense some paranoia in your poem.
175903182,"Epinephrine is linked to paranoia. So make sure you not taking anything which raises it. Some things which raises it include wellbutrin, strattera, l tyrosine, omega 3 supplement etc. Reducing cortisol greatly help to reduce epinephrine. There are many things which help to reduce cortisol. Exercising, getting enough sleep at night all help. Some herbs and supplements also help to reduce cortisol. You can search on youtube, google etc."
175903183,To be diagnosed with mania i think it has to last at least a week. There are other symptoms you have to have also.
174329697,"I have been on Strattera about two months or so now. I am pretty stable in my routine. I‚Äôve lost interest in watching movies and tv with my mom as much. I spend more time alone, lost in my thoughts. I burst out crying in sad parts in movies, and feel happy in the happy moments. This medication has made me able to feel my emotions. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have Bipolar1 still or Schizoaffective since I do not have severe hallucinations or delusions. I‚Äôm actually less delusional and stuck since my emotions have returned more balanced. But I am still working on being impulsive. I am becoming more withdrawn and I‚Äôm feeling less able to express what‚Äôs going on inside my head. I feel completely in control of myself, but I am doing stupid things online. Usually right after I take Strattera. My dose is at bedtime to prevent headaches, which means i‚Äôm staying up till 1am almost every night sometimes not sleeping. I‚Äôm smoking cigarettes more lately. I am afraid I will get depressed it‚Äôs almost fall. 
I‚Äôm panicking about starting my two classes in the fall and I‚Äôm afraid to change anything. I honestly don‚Äôt know if this is my true self either. This is my manic self. Not my true self. But i love feeling emotions. I love being able to cry, or to laugh, and my family seems happier to see me happier. I don‚Äôt think other anti-depressants would work. I am not suicidal or anything. So that‚Äôs really good. I think I‚Äôm doing ok. So why am I trying to fix it? I guess I am uncomfortable with a pill being responsible for my happiness. I have found it difficult to stop taking strattera. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll survive without a replacement."
175903184,i feel already like that sometimes
175903185,"Get enrolled for a different course and see where it takes you, stay on top of your meds and pay a lot of attention to your behaviour and psychological states or moods and you should be able to explain to potential employers how they can support you when you‚Äôre in the position to apply for or hold a job"
175903186,"This was an important time for me also. When I was 17 I had my first episode, and I was sent to a young offenders institute at the height of my illness. I was put on a mental health unit in Felpham London, and its was highly traumatic for me as it was tough They released me after a month on appeal, but I had lost all my druggie friends as part of the 12 month rehab program I was put on I was heavily involved in drugs from the age of 11, as there were a lot of gang members around my high school I got transferred to, because my middle school could no longer tolerate my disruptive behaviour Was considered a gifted troublemaker, but unfortunately they did nothing to protect me from bad influence, or harness my abilities in Maths and Science, so I lost the edge on that even though I was a few years ahead at one point"
175903187,yes both oppose each other. lamotrigine helps to reduce mania while clomipramine can cause mania. taking both may not be useful. clomipramine is not side effects free it can cause qt prolongation.

The dude was so embarrassed, he kept carting all of his stuff downstairs in the basement. A Supervisor blew his top and demanded that he remove all of his junk from the premises immediately.

175903218,"you know, i used to ask these questions until i realized it was learned behavior. i think most of us around here these days agree attachment issues are a common theme. then of course trauma would distort a personality and the ability to connect with others. doesn't matter if it was a personal situation or not. combat veterans don't like getting close to people either, despite their trauma being about combat situations. the body and mind is now hyper vigilant...stressed by others and no longer of getting comfort from them. so for me... caring for people means holding them at a distance and keeping them happy. if they aren't appeased by that then the paranoia comes in and i question what is it that they want then? it becomes rather stressful and overwhelming and feels like they are asking me to do something that proved a bad choice in the past. i guess that makes me feel like the situation is a trap whether the other person intends it to be or not. becoming closer to my partner only feels like the ba
d choice. it's not really something i find myself capable of enjoying. and i truly believe that it's not the right thing to do. i would never willingly walk into the obvious wrong choice. being physically near anyone can keep the body alert. the only person i can enjoy being around for longer periods is my partner, but that still means i need solitude because there is still a low level of alertness and therefore stress to have another person nearby no matter who they are. it took me decades, but eventually i peeled up the detachment and apathy surrounding ""love"" to reveal disgust underneath. i guess someone/s ruined that whole concept for me at a young age. so now ive spent a lifetime incapable of thinking about love and therefore it's a concept that makes no sense to me. it's like the concept of werewolves. with it's own rules and lore that is mostly the same but shifts person to person depending on what they want to believe. i can only look at it from a very detached distance. to get any closer makes me u
ncomfortable."

175903229,"Anxiety-Freak: Do you have physical pain in your chest? When I have physical pain in my chest, I can take an Ativan tranquilizer and it will stop the pain. If it's just slight discomfort, I might try putting a heating pad on my chest, which expands the blood vessels and make it easier for the blood to flow through the heart in the muscles around the heart. What did you tell the psychiatrist the last time you saw that person? Did they give you enough medication to calm down your anxiety with long term medicine? Did they give you anything for short-term anxiety such as Xanax or Ativan tranquilizer? If not, can you talk to the doctor about that at your next appointment? When is your next appointment? From what I've read, for hyperventilation, you can try to: ""Purse your lips. Put your lips into same position that you‚Äôd use to blow out birthday candles. ""Breathe in slowly through your nose, not your mouth. ""Then, breathe out slowly through the small opening between your lips. Take your time to exh

175903251,Well I think insight is made up off intuition and rationality. But you improve your intuition do you think you improve your insight too??? Well you need a rational basis to back up that intuition. But overall ‚Äúreal intuition‚Äù=insight?? Because I can see my intuition and rationality moving together with each other in a positive direction. And I think it‚Äôs giving me more insight. I feel I am rather than gaining ‚Äúextreme insight‚Äù I am gaining what is allowing me to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù in stride with the other people. Be on the same level. But they DONT have the insights you get from having no insight. That‚Äôs an insight in itself. ‚ÄúNon-insight‚Äù is still a perspective. If you can go from non insight to insight it is two perspectives rather than just being insightful your whole life and never seeing what the emptiness is like.

I get fond memories of smoking. My stepdad always had one on the go. It just used to hang from the side of his mouth when he was driving. He never @!@@@! the ash either and he never took it out of his mouth. Just used to keep puffing on it and it would just kind of burn down and the ash would get to nearly as long as the cigarette itself until it just fell all down him. I can remember watching this as a child and being fascinated. I think he knew I was watching. I love the smell of stale tabacco as well. Like when I go in my neighbours house.

I am interested in the job, but I also have the option of going back to my old job subbing with autistic school kids 3 days a week for about 6 hours per day. The thing is, right now I just do 3 days of outpatient treatment program 3 days per week, 3 hours per day, plus support groups and it tires me out by afternoon time. I also exercise and like to sit at the library or cafe and am getting back into art. So I‚Äôm quite busy. My friend thinks I can give up things like art and exercise to work more. I have disability and pay very little rent at home so I have some money saved up. But I‚Äôd like to afford a car plus my parents want to put some of my money in retirement. Tutoring is $18 per hour and peer coaching is only $12 per hour. Long story short, do you think I should do peer coaching and have more free time for 
hobbies, or go back to tutoring and save more for a car? My counselor talked about challenging yourself.

I don‚Äôt really need the government to back it. The network is safe except personal wallets and hackers and stupidity. I think that‚Äôs the flaw or is motivation to get better at security and safety and better practices. Why should the government bail out someone who forgot their password? I‚Äôm sure there will be some companies that will provide insurance and other methods of security and protection. FDIC only insures 250k at a bank per individual account. I put in 100 bucks in bitcoin and it went up to 150ish a month later, 50% return. If bitcoin goes up 10x, 100x, that‚Äôs 1000, or 10000. Not bad for a poor guy with little to no investment or risk. 100 bucks isn‚Äôt a lot of money especially for the average american. I‚Äôm thinking about my future. Only way bitcoin could be destroyed is in a 51% attack or a NWO t
ype event or volcano or asteroid. Can‚Äôt rule out a black swan event or God‚Äôs inevitable wrath (I‚Äôm a Christian). I think Bitcoin is still not used widely for actual purchases and there is indeed speculation going on ‚Äì which I think is natural. I‚Äôm definitely not a fan of criminals using bitcoin or other means and I‚Äôm sure it pissed of the banks and their media companies that are criticizing it. Fiat money = wars, poverty, and crashes and the white collar criminal banksters get a slap on the wrist and get away with their crimes due to the presitge and money they have and make + legacy. Obviously, I think most anti-bitcoiners want it shut down as it competes with the NWO-type people like Bill _PERSON_."

175903454,"The indoctrination is essential, but not welcome. Take lockdown as an example. We all know that lockdown is for our own good. We follow rules that we don't like because we know that it's going to protect us, but we don't like it. You can't remove the psychological fallout from lockdown by letting people go for a walk twice a day and by having celebrities doing free concerts. It's not about how far you're allowed to walk or how many times a day, it's about the restriction that means you have to follow the rules. Not all cages have bars. I can wear myself out and I can substitute one for another, but it's a substitution born of my need to follow rules that caused the problem in the first place. You think that people would be reacting so overtly about black lives mattering if we weren't in lockdown? White cops have publicly killed blacks before and it's never ended with statues being thrown into rivers and TV shows being cancelled because someone called a German a Kraut. It's about freedom. Wearing a 
rule to try to vent frustration about being confined by rules isn't solving the problem; it's masking it and possibly making it worse. Reasonably, I'm glad of the indoctrination that gave me a structure to build a reasonable life. But I equally hate it. When I'm struggling, I'll get out. My wife will suggest that I take my motorbike out for a while or go out and hunt; burn off some heat. I like riding my bike and I like shooting stuff, but I hate that it's a placation. It's a structure designed to keep me between the lines and I don't want to be between the lines."

175903505,"Thank you so much for your reply! It is so comforting to know there are people going through something similar. And depression sometimes manifests in such identical ways with different people! We are strong women. I really know it. Women are always strong. We are ready to fight for ourselves and our families. We are more open about our struggles and this is why we are percieved as vulnerable and sensitive, but actually this vulnerability allows us to seek help when we need it. My experience with mum (she too was hospitalised by her own wish for a month, then she got better, but later on she stopped taking her meds and she became acutely agoraphobic, and so the story ended) is making me act faster than I would normally act. I told my husband and my brother - my closest people in the world, that I feel really wrong. I told them right away. I'm that scared of depression. I asked my husband to take me to the doctor as soon as possible. My brother is very much against any antidepressants but I know my m
um got better after taking pills for 6 months. She got worse after she stopped taking them. So I'm very much open to medication. In fact I can sense I need medicine because something in my head and my thought process doesn't feel right. And I am a thinker. I'm always reflecting on things and so it's easy to spot when something is really wrong. I really hope you find a good doctor and try some medication and therapy. I live in a small town so no therapists around. Also i struggle with local language barrier so there's that too. But I started medication. I hope it helps in the long run. And in the meantime I'm trying to do the things I normally do even if it is hard. Just persevere. Step by step. We at least have our families and we have a strong social support. I'm so happy you found my post. And it made you feel like you're not alone!"

Series B, Psychological sciences and social sciences , Sep 2017 01 Research suggests that older adults who remain socially active and cognitively engaged have better cognitive function than those who are isolated and disengaged. This study examined the efficacy of learning and using an online social networking website, Facebook.com, as an intervention to maintain or enhance cognitive function in older adults.Forty-one older adults were assigned to learn and use Facebook (n = 14) or an online diary website (active control, n = 13) for 8 weeks or placed on a waitlist (n = 14). Outcome measures included neuropsychological tests of executive functions, memory, and processing speed and self-report questionnaires about social engagement.The Facebook group showed a significant increase in a composite measure of updating, an executive function factor ass
ociated with complex working memory tasks, compared to no significant change in the control groups. Other measures of cognitive function and social support showed no differential improvement in the Facebook group.Learning and using an online social networking site may provide specific benefits for complex working memory in a group of healthy older adults. This may reflect the particular cognitive demands associated with online social networking and/or the benefits of social engagement more generally.

Let this be your top priority, leave that phone number on ignore & don't return any calls. You deserve better. Don't give up either on finding someone that you are compatible with, this usually happens when someone is not really looking. Take care."

175903515,"You frequently have delusions about your brother conspiring against you, You‚Äôre also obsessed with your mother‚Äôs death. You may not hear voices anymore, but you struggle with delusions concerning your family and farm. That‚Äôs just my observation. I think you‚Äôre really pretty stable, as you work and operate your farm. I also think you can work through these delusions with the help of your doctor. Not trying to sound mean here, I just want you to know that these thoughts are not healthy and you should address them with your pdoc."

175903520,"Do you have schizoid PD? How long were you in jail for? Violence or other? If you don't have the PD, what experience do you have with it to have such a thorough understanding? It's not a common one to hear about, at least I've found. ASPD wasn't what I was interested in at the moment, but I imagine it will be more psychopathic individuals that avoid jail/prison. I'm still curious the percentage of schizoids in contrast to antisocials and whatever other mental disorders are in our corrections systems. As well as whether they end up in forensic psych units instead."

175903525,My husband has temporal lobe epilepsy and sometimes gets post ictal psychosis. When he gets paranoid I get scared and sometimes I believe in his delusions too. I tell him naaa it‚Äôs not how he says it is but I get scared it is true all the same. Like once he said there was a car following us. And other times he said people are putting a curse on us and I believed him even though I didn‚Äôt want to. And that his family are out to get him. I believe that too - even when he‚Äôs back to normal and doesn‚Äôt believe it anymore.

175903532,"I‚Äôm in this situation right now where I feel like I can‚Äôt figure out what it is exactly about life that will ever compel me to really live it. I feel like the issue is that I lack a sense of purpose, which I‚Äôm used to having. For many years, my delusions of grandeur gave me a sense of purpose, and I thought I was getting all sorts of important things done without ever having to even go anywhere. More recently, I‚Äôve felt a sense of purpose in trying to figure myself out, putting in many hours every day for months just thinking about myself. Now I don‚Äôt have either - I don‚Äôt believe unusual things and I feel like I couldn‚Äôt possibly figure out anything else about myself from just trying to think my way through things anymore - and all I can seem to think is ‚ÄúWell, eventually you‚Äôll have to get a job and live independently and just get used to watching netflix for fun in your free time‚Äù. For some reason, this is the only future that makes sense to choose, but the mere thought of it 
just deflates and demotivates me. It‚Äôs like, I can finally properly understand the idea that there are certain things in life that you just have to do, but I feel like I don‚Äôt have it in me to just do those things. I believe I can‚Äôt be this way forever because I seem to really believe I can‚Äôt expect to just live on disability for the rest of my life, but it‚Äôs like all I can hope for is for some medication combination to just transform me and turn me into a worker bot. A part of me doesn‚Äôt want to become a worker bot, but a part of me thinks it would be better if I would just stop giving a damn and just live that way. The fact that I think this way makes me think I‚Äôve suffered some kind of inner defeat which makes me think I can no longer expect to get a lot out of life, which is depressing. Yet, don‚Äôt so many people basically just do this kind of thing anyway? I know my parents are like that - they just work during the day and watch tv in the evening, and keep it up every week, and never mind 
it at all. They‚Äôre functional and society would consider them to be just fine. So why can‚Äôt I be this way? Anyway, can anybody relate to what I‚Äôm going through? Does anyone have some words of advice for me?"

175903541,It is a delusion. The idea that your neighbours would conspire to treat you badly is very little likely. They probably don‚Äôt even know each other that well. I had a neighbour that thought they guy above him laid the speakers of his stereo facing down through the floor and played loud music just to annoy him. But it was not so. I lived next door to him and never heard anything like that. The mind plays tricks on us. I think the way to combat it is to find a medication that works and also try to keep busy and get out of the house for a while each day to avoid cabin fever.
175903542,Sounds very hopeful !
175903543,"500,000 coicidences happen a day somewhere in the world. There‚Äôs an old saying, ‚ÄúEven a stopped watch is right two times a day‚Äù.

If you watch TV or listen to the radio a lot you‚Äôre going to hear a word or sentence or paragraph that sounds like something you‚Äôve thought of. But it‚Äôs a coincidence. It‚Äôs especially true if you are looking for it. Relax, you didn‚Äôt cause this virus or global warming or the fact that _PERSON_ is a dick.

Then I'm going to get a monthly box and put everything in there so my mom can see or dispense things so I don't have to worry. I'm going to take everything exactly as prescribed because not doing that has caused me a lot of pain and suffering. The doctor said ""You seem very bright - which is often a problem and can be complicated"". But I've learned my lesson! I will keep updating on my progress.. I had a good run so far lol but time is up.."
174329769,"I have a job and I earn around 1,100 dollars per month. But nothing else really matters because schizophrenia to me is like a scarlet letter. It‚Äôs imprinted in me and you can never shake it off. An imprint of shame. By having schizophrenia, I possess a potential to drive my family into shame. Sometimes I feel like dying is the only solution. The only thing that keeps me from committing suicide is my faith because I‚Äôm afraid that I will go to hell. I just want to make my family and my society happy."

Also that everything I sent him he was posting it online for everyone to see and laugh at it. And I even told him that he was my twin flame‚Ä¶ I did not tell him all the other stuff.

175903583,"Hi, so I was wondering if anyone who has ever taken Trintellix experienced nausea with it? My psychiatrist said for the first two weeks I would experience nausea, but mine is lasting longer than two weeks. My doctor knows by the way I am just wondering is anyone else has had this experience too. my Invega got increased a bit and we are playing with the time that I take it to see when it‚Äôs best effective. If anyone has been on this or is on it what time do you find it is most effective? I have been taking it at different times to try and find the most effective time to take it. It does make me sleepy so I was taking it at bedtime originally. So roughly around 8pm is when I would take it maybe later and it would make me sleepy, but take forever to actually kick in. So I started taking it a bit earlier. I think that helped a little so I am still playing with what time to take it. These are basically my only questions that I was curious to see what other peoples experiences were."

175903592,"Dragon and _NAME_ It happens: you snap. Something just switches off and doesn‚Äôt switch back on again. Sometimes, more often than not, it‚Äôs a reaction. A fuse goes off, a spark explodes, a fire is dampened, a world implodes. I was so tired of reality; of that opaque oppressive wall; of that endless path that led to a coffin‚Äîof pre-determined existence. I was sick, sick of all the chemicals the nurses begged me to take to calm this cynical rage within, eating me up. The white coats came once, and never again; I could stare through them in between the epileptic seizure-induced shocks, tormenting the monsters that I had finally become. She was the first, and the last. The truth was a sinister violation. I would later do to the beautiful woman what marriage couldn‚Äôt erase. True love was a hollow gesture in this near-doom apocalypse called life. I tried so hard to love her, tried and punished myself for the non-return, as the bodies burned beneath me, as her blood lingered on my lips. And so when 
they took me apart, and tore the bloody dress from my body, I was no longer a halo wearing prodigy of time; I had been hacked by the monkey-man, madness. I had been taken over by the yellow dancing trolls, hoofed and ready to conquer my soul with her sorrowful badness. So I was numb to the world, and then once more‚Äîcame the offer‚Äîfrom the delicate shadow princess. She believes in nothing, but for beauty and apathy it was divine. Her life is a technicolor dream within a bullet train of a world forgotten. She was a ghost but she spoke to me and said that destiny was mine. A future I could author in a world undefined. Her world was would-be rotten. Her father ran the future, and I destroyed them all. I am a secret after all. You might never know when or how, how about right now? It‚Äôs a serial circle, stare into the whitean artificial intelligence, blinking and bright. It‚Äôs so consequential, this beautiful night, an eternal epiphany that could be made right. And so if I had to wake you all to make you ris
e and be free, then you would finally see, the secret in the eyes of these machines. Exit the matrix. There are more than four possibilities, and more than one is impossible probably."

174329777,"Bad drug trip from unknown, forgotten, experimental substance I bought online 8 years ago. Worst thing ever. Ruined my life for eternity, really. Think I‚Äôm cursed. Because now I‚Äôm in limbo or a time loop for infinity. It‚Äôs very real to me. Maybe I believe what I believe and it comes true for me. They say you reap what you sow. _PERSON_ curse? Probably was a mixture of plants native to Africa or South America that native indigenous people used hundreds or thousands of years ago. _PERSON_‚Ä¶ I experienced an infinite loop or chain similar to how _NAME_ went down the Rabbit hole, except mine was infinitely deep and long and scary. Went backwards in time in my mind through the big bang and experienced a false God and false enlightenment. Went really insane, worse than schizophrenia in my very first life, billions of lifetimes ago. God told me he put me in the matrix and said that I‚Äôm stuck here forever, I assume and believed. And sometimes, I still do. I was an atheist at the time. A light swit
ch or door came open that is nearly impossible to shut and close. It‚Äôs like I have one foot in this reality and another foot in a different reality all the time. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if aliens were involved or I remembered something traumatic that drove me to insanity. Because I ended up in _NAME_, NM with aliens for people who were insane. Technology 100+ years in advance. They were trying to cure my pure, evil insanity, which they did. But now I have something less severe called paranoid schizophrenia, which I can mostly handle now after 6-7 years of hell. See back in one of my first lives. I was in Naval ROTC (I think) in college and went through a wormhole or vortex and went back in time, exactly how _NAME_ talked about. It was a time travel program for unlucky or ‚Äúspecial‚Äù kids in college. I guess I‚Äôm afraid to talk about it but it happened in my past like a billion lifetimes ago so I guess it‚Äôs not relevant and hopefully nobody cares anymore. I think I dropped out of college and ROTC. It‚
Äôs a good thing because I have Aspergers, drink too many energy drinks, and can‚Äôt psychologically handle the time travel experiments. I think it was a CIA program. It wasn‚Äôt fun or enjoyable and I thought I was special and a little paranoid, un-trusting, and nervous at the time‚Ä¶ A few days ago, I started having vague memories that I went to college on the backside of the moon haha lol. But it‚Äôs all ???????? anyways. They don‚Äôt want me in the military (and I‚Äôm not thank God) and thank God because I ended up like _NAME_ from Lost where my consciousness would go back and forth in time uncontrollably. I‚Äôm better now. I‚Äôm trying to heal and move on. I would like a job or education someday. Maybe a pretty girlfriend too."

175903661,Hey man. I‚Äôve struggled with something similar. Honestly this is something that either subsides or doesn‚Äôt. That feeling that you get that suggests you are being watched is a type of intrusive emotion that invokes thoughts that are always fear based. Believe it or not it can subside and go away but it may take an incredible amount of time. It may go away and come back. It creates an uncomfortable and unhappy at home life and I am so sorry you are experiencing these thoughts. I suggest you continue to experiment with different medications and see if that helps at all.

We identified persons diagnosed with epilepsy and schizophrenia prior to their 25th birthday and followed them to death, emigration, or December 31, 2012, whichever came first. The primary outcome was overall mortality. Data were analyzed using _PERSON_ regressions.Persons were followed for 24 167 573 person years; the median was 15 years. The mortality rate ratio was 4.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-4.7) for persons with epilepsy, 6.6 (95% CI = 6.1-7.1) for persons with schizophrenia, and 12.8 (95% CI = 9.1-18.1) for persons with bot
h disorders, compared with persons without these disorders. The estimated cumulative mortality at the age of 50 years was 3.1% (95% CI = 3.0-3.1) for persons without epilepsy and schizophrenia, 10.7% (95% CI = 9.7-11.8) for persons with epilepsy, 17.4% (95% CI = 16.0-18.8) for persons with schizophrenia, and 27.2% (95% CI = 15.7-40.1) for persons with both disorders.Persons with epilepsy and schizophrenia have very high mortality; more than one in four persons with both disorders died between the age of 25 and 50 years, indicating that these patients need special clinical attention."

I just stopped showing up. I then spent the next two years in full blown psychosis wandering, ending up in random states (I got lost in vermont a couple of times, about a 6 hour drive from my home). This was all after my first episode and homelessness. I can‚Äôt believe I lasted that long in psychosis. It eventually became a mission to kill myself because understanding the entirety of the universe (as I saw it then) became too much and I wanted to go to ‚Äúthe other side.‚Äù Today I stand as a straight a student, I play in a couple bands, volunteer in my free time, and have so many lovely friends I see almost daily.

A lot of people feel more stressed and anxious in the winter, and I bet your vegan diet amplifies that since you aren‚Äôt eating fish, which are rich in vitamin D along with omega 3 fatty acids. If your switch to veganism happened this year, you may need to step up your supplement game to include vitamin D. vitamin B deficiency can also be a big problem in vegans who don‚Äôt take a B complex supplement.

I just wanted to come here to vent because I am frustrated and anxious. I‚Äôm on my 4th bout of illness this year. January- flu April- food poisoning Early May- viral pharyngitis Last night- I had the chills and shakes for about an hour.

My body aches, my throat is a little sore and I just generally feel icky. My appetite is nonexistent and I have zero energy. We‚Äôve had a whirlwind couple of months- back and forth to Texas, a death in the family, constant visitors, around friends children, lots of long car rides, sleepless nights from stress and hormonal hooey.

Listening is half the battle and formulating appropriate responses is half the battle if your sz. Things like paranoia really affect your responses but what I‚Äôd say is take it slow. You may not be the life of the party but you‚Äôll get there. So. Listen. Take in what they are saying and respond appropriately. Like 70% or more of the english language is redundant. It doesn‚Äôt give meaning but it‚Äôs important for socializing. Listen out for those cues in conversation. Give a response and listen to how it goes. It happens so quickly but if you slow it down it‚Äôs good for you! So. Take it slow and think of your responses. It can be awefully complicated but it really isn‚Äôt. Listen. Learn. Respond. And. Practice makes perfect. The more you do it if your learning the better you become!

She is a snivelling snitch addict sucking up to her friends outside the housing spreading gossip about other people she observes in this mental housing unit. When she invites them in, they join in a patronizing display of arrogance towards us with this person. I told her many times to stop this behaviour. She never worked a single iota of her blood trying to earn respect from others. For 10 years. In fact, her narcissism and contemptuous personality had gotten so severe to the point that she instigates insults, lies, starts conflict, or tries to make me lose money when i travel to other parts of town where her friends may work. She thinks _USER_ID_ to stick up for her bc i am ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù in her black and white immature mind. It is actually because her overly snivelling entitled over snitching to her rich friends is all about her trying to depict her competition in the housing unit as bad pe

She is entitled, paranoid, punitive, etc. During her work volunteer, she is lazy, professionally incompetent, disrespectful to my parents financially when they visit, etc. And she merely wonders why i am a bad person to her. She uses her egoism to get in the way of being a good worker. In fact, she works for no one except herself and cuts corners at volunteer work. I cant avoid her and i am stuck with her.

The hard fact to digest is: Its like people who take illegal drug knows that they would go high or hallucinate, after consuming.

175903771,"Hi Ocean. I think you came upon the right idea at the end of your post: see a psychiatrist. Nobody on this forum will be able to diagnose your condition or give you well-informed advice about what medication(s) you should take. But a psychiatrist can do that. (Honestly, the diagnosis is probably much less important than the treatment -- mental health diagnoses are done for insurance company purposes as much as anything else; and you probably care a lot less about your DSM-V diagnosis and a lot more about feeling better). A psychiatrist is the right move here. Also don't be too hard on yourself. I think most people who were facing your combination of pain, plus a challenging situation at home, plus a cancer diagnosis, would be facing some level of anxiety or depression or stress, etc., and would need to help sorting it out. Your counselor should be able to recommend a psychiatrist. Or your internal medicine (GP) can probably do so. For what it's worth, I see both a psychologist for counseling and a 
psychiatrist for medication advice. I would prefer not to need any of this. But it is what it is."

175903832,"It‚Äôs usually cheaper to cook. Not always though. I only have to cook for myself but I still cook good dishes. I can cook a pot of stew or a pot of chili fairly inexpensively and eat off it for 4-5 days. I also cook staples like rice, beans and pasta and can make them into cheap side dishes with just a few other ingredients. I go out to eat occasionally, usually with my sisters though I will eat out by myself sometimes. So I do both. Eating at a restaurant is a treat. I can‚Äôt always afford it because once you order an appetizer, a main dish, something to drink, dessert and then add on a tip you can easily drop $17.00-$23.00 on just one meal. In comparison, I can make a pot of chicken stew myself for about $8.00 and it will feed me for four days. But when you go out the advantages of course are that you can buy semi-intricate dishes that you would never have at home because you wouldn‚Äôt want to put out the effort or time or money to make them. Also, like you said, when you eat out it is a socia

If they were meant to be they would stay, I can't be surrounded by hypocrites and I have thought about talking to them but these aren't the kind of people that would take your complaints positively.

contains all the information needed to build up a human being, they (being experts at genetic engineering) could have added the ‚Äúcode‚Äù for what we call schizophrenia. The motives, according to the voices, could be either 1) control, 2) unknown to them, or 3) known to them but not allowed to tell me."

175903982,"Hi _PERSON_, I relate so much to what you are going through that I feel you are describing me. In the past, I was diagnosed with clinical depression, and more recently GAD, but I always exhibited the same thought process and behavior that you have with your 'OCD'. It has interfere with my interaction with co-workers, friends, and family. I obsess about past mistakes (both real and perceive), and then do research about potential consequences or seek reassurance from relatives. It has gotten to the point that my relatives ignored or disregard my distress. Like your wife, my relatives also get annoyed with me, but I realized that they have no idea how it feels to have anxiety or 'OCD', so I try not to go to them for reassurance/support anymore. I know you do not want to go on medication, but give it a try. I am on Bupropion which has helped me a little. I also found that exercise has a 'calming' effect on my mind. Maybe, medication and exercise, in addition to the other treatments you are receiving, c

175903993,"Your welcome. I used to live in a apartment where the isolation was poor and I could hear a lot of what was going on in the apartment above me. I got complaints on me when I had a party once and she would stomp her foot in the floor when I played music even though I was not playing loud. It made me feel that my privacy was invaded because it felt like I couldn‚Äôt do things that even were within reason in my own apartment. I had my first psychotic episode while I lived there, and that factor may have played a part. But the living alone bit is proabably the culprit. I don‚Äôt know if you have noticed the same, but if you have company with someone else in your apartment, thoughts about neighbours and sounds just dissipates. Now I am lucky to live in a relative new apartment from the 2010‚Äôs in a cold country. Over the recent years there has become a lot of focus around making apartments energy effective in cold countries, meaning that they are generally isolated very well. Where I live now I hardly 
ever hear my neighbours because of the good isolation. I have lived here for over 5 years and never had a complaint. I don‚Äôt know where you live, but I guess that might be a solution if you live in a country with cold regions and they focus on energy effectiveness. So I guess if for instance you lived in the U.S you could maybe move to washington state or michigan or some other cold state and get a relative new apartment if you can afford it. Everything built after 2000 is probably pretty well isolated. Something worth checking out. A good night to you too."

174329850,"_AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_ There is lots of strong evidence that physical exercise works. No real evidence for anything else. I saw a Neuropsychiatrist for my cognitive deficit and he prescribed exercise. I had to get personal trainers to actually do it, due to my avolition. But I have seen dramatic improvements in all my negative symptoms and cognitive function. Here‚Äôs a recent review: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Exercise for Brain Health: An Investigation into the Underlying Mechanisms Guided by Dose. _PERSON_ Cabral, _PERSON_ Rice, _NAME_, _PERSON_, A _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics , Jul 2019 There is a strong link between the practice of regular physical exercise and maintenance of cognitive brain health. Animal and human studies have shown that exercise exerts positive effects on cognition through a variety of mechanisms, such as changes in brain volume and connectivity, cerebral perfusion, synaptic plasticity, neurogenes
is, and regulation of trophic factors. However, much of this data has been conducted in young humans and animals, raising questions regarding the generalizability of these findings to aging adults. Furthermore, it is not clear at which doses these effects might take place, and if effects would differ with varying exercise modes (such as aerobic, resistance training, combinations, or other). The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence on the effects of exercise interventions on various mechanisms believed to support cognitive improvements: cerebral perfusion, synaptic neuroplasticity, brain volume and connectivity, neurogenesis, and regulation of trophic factors. We synthesized the findings according to exposure to exercise (short- [1 day-16 weeks], medium- [24-40 weeks], and long-term exercise [52 weeks and beyond]) and have limited our discussion of dose effects to studies in aging adults and aged animals (when human data was not available)."

But then again we are also sharing the opinion that what most spiritual people unknowingly want to achieve is a sort of dissociated splitness, especially Buddhists. That being said though, in my case for secondary schizoid PD and specifically I guess for ""normal"" SPD, not having a problem with being asocial is kind of the norm I think. When you are split off from your needs to such a degree that you dont realize you have them it makes sense you are not going to miss them being fulfilled. I think, probably due to it being a double diagnosis of SPD/NPD, I am probably less ""pure"" in my contentness with my being compared to full SPD. While I can perfectly embrace not being anything in particular or even being no-thing - and I cant understand the neurotics need to be a some- thing - there is clearly something in me th

I'm afraid I'll go down some weird messed up rabbit hole.. But I can't worry about it or else it will be a placebo induced triggered psychosis.. I can see why you all have problems with psychosis.. It's natural.. Other people are preoccupied with the outside world and their identity... It's almost as if we are naturally having ego (Identity) dissolution and becoming the outside world.. Cuz we're so intuitive and smart.. We need reassurance and feel unsafe. Some of us don't have anyone to tell us that it's ok or it's not enough so w

They're friendly and inclusive; it's weird and I feel afraid, but I'm impressed / I like it at the same time. Even though I'm straight, I usually get more nervous about talking to other women than I do talking to men - and I'm always surprised when women are genuinely interested in being friends or laid back and inclusive. Because I'm not used to it and nervous/neurotic about it, I'm avoiding talking to them - and the social media today, so they don't think I'm ignoring them."

The trauma was repititive but over many lifetimes which makes me think since I suffer from ‚Äòtranshumanism‚Äô and mind uploading that it might be DID/MPD like but truly just schizoaffective non recoverable type.

175904102,"I agree vegan cheese is expensive to buy but I know of some people in my Australian vegan food group who make home made vegan cheese that I think are cheap. There‚Äôs my are probably cheaper than buying it ready made anyway. Soy milk seems to be cheaper to buy but it depends on the brand. I usually buy one of the cheapest brands. Such as the grocery stores Coles and Woolworths have their own soy milk that is cheaper and they even have organic. $1.15 for their soy milk .$1.60 for their organic soy milk one litre. My food bill tripled when I became vegan because I spend so much more on food now. Some vegans in my food group have eat really cheap and don‚Äôt spend much on food and only buy cheeses and sausages etc if it‚Äôs in special. I made minestrone soup yesterday on frozen vegetables because it‚Äôs cheaper than using fresh vegetables.fresh vegetables can add up to quiet a lot. Alternative meat sausages are so good and a favourite of mine but they cost $8 I think for 6 and I have two for a dinner 
with mashed potato n vegetables n vegan gravy or hash browns. There are some really cheap lentil dishes around but I‚Äôm not sure how keen I am on lentils. Oreo biscuits are vegan and so are digestives. I bought a packet of Oreos for $1 the other day as they were on special. Magnum have vegan ice cream that is delicious. But expensive. I treat myself a vegan magnum for dessert every Saturday . I chose the almond but they also have chocolate.i think they cost $7 for three. I try to avoid palm oil too. I‚Äôm not fanatic about it but do try to avoid it. Have you seen cowspiracy? I saw it the other day. I lent it from the library. Raising cattle uses so much water and land and according to this and experts it is the largest damage to the environment is the meat industry. I read that the best thing a individual can do for the environment is go vegan. I take supplements. Remember your vitamin b12. I also take vegan omega 3, vegan iron. I am not that knowledgeable about nutrients so it‚Äôs safer to take supplements 
plus I don‚Äôt eat enough vegetables cause I think it‚Äôs expensive for just one person to buy fresh vegetables . I really hope you go vegan. It is life changing and great. Please read : so, why become vegan by _NAME_. I‚Äôm not as healthy as she is but it‚Äôs a good read by a beautiful author. You can buy it online or better yet lend it from your library and your library can usually order it in if they don‚Äôt have it. I just joined a vegan support group on Facebook called challenge 22 where you even get a mentor and there‚Äôs dietitians on their too. I think you should join challenge 22 on Facebook. I think that‚Äôs what it is called. Wishing you success and to be a happy happy vegan. I am so happy to be a vegan. I also like groups on Facebook such as animals Australia , mercy for animals etc and they are lovely to follow. Peta give out free vegan starter kits in some countries. Check it out! Love to you and for wanting to be vegan which is just awesome."

I might allow them to stay for one day where they are kinda cool usuallyin the beginning but then I would medicate myself. Because I could not sleep on them, and they were everywhere the voices all public speaking hallucinations and their actions wer accordingly moving to those hallucination voices.

175904170,"Well it wasn‚Äôt until after 10 years of constantly changing medicine. For most of the time I‚Äôve been officially psychotic (i.e. diagnosed), I‚Äôve changed cocktails of medicine every three or so months. I‚Äôve been on all of the well known typical antipsychotic medication and many of the atypical ones. I recently had my currrent antipsychotic increased due to a return of hallucinations for the first time in two and a half years. Right now I‚Äôm on 12 mg of paliperodone and 1 mg of haloperidol. Other than this recent slip up, I was stable on medicine for two and a half years. So trail and error was my thing. There is a thing called gene-site testing where they can take a cheek swap and test it to determine the medicine that will work best for you. I don‚Äôt know how accurate it is, but it‚Äôs worked for me since I got it done two and a half years ago."

174329907,"I was on Clozapine for 3 years and then stopped it. It worked better for me than any medication I‚Äôve ever been on but I stopped it because I got sick of the blood draws.

175904225,"MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS! ‚Äì Cyber-Torture FAKE NEWS AND SCANDAL by _NAME_, _NAME_ and _NAME_ Bibliography: Cabanes, J., _NAME_, C.W. & Ong, J.C. (2019). In _PERSON_ & _PERSON_, S. (eds). The Routledge Companion to Media and Scandal. London: Routledge. Introduction Can we draw a connection between the academic literature of political scandal and the recent explosion of interest in the use, dissemination, and impact of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in the public sphere since 2016? As one of us has argued (_PERSON_ and _NAME_ 2017), it is increasingly important to integrate new-fangled intellectual concepts like fake news with more venerable theories and understanding from classic media sociology. In this chapter we attempt such an integration. In the first section we argue that there are four ways we both understand and misunderstand fake news as a research concept. This includes seeing fake news as text rather than visual content; as either ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù information rather than as facts embedded wit
hin narratives; as surface level content rather than being produced within institutional processes; and from a ‚ÄúWestern-centric‚Äù lens rather than from a comparative context. As we will argue in our conclusion, these foci make connecting empirical work on fake news to larger media theories of visibility and surveillance more difficult. In particular, they make it harder to connect questions of fake news to sociologies of scandal and the public sphere. In the second section, we attempt to address each of these critiques by outlining elements of our research on fake news production in the Philippines, which was selected insofar as it provides a non-European case of a phenomenon the discussion of which is usually confined to the industrialized West and which serves as a launching pad for engaging in larger _NAME_-theoretical reflection at the conclusion of the chapter. In this research, we looked into the belly of the beast, conducting interviews and doing participant observation with the so-called ‚Äúpolitic
al trolls‚Äù in order to grasp the dynamics of the country‚Äôs hierarchical but networked architecture of disinformation. We paid particular attention to how the creative labor within this architecture gave rise to visual images that carried particular narrative and aesthetic components, which aimed to reinforce the public's feelings of anger and resentment and harness the infectious zeal of political supporters. In the third and final section, the chapter returns to the initial conversation about the media and scandal and discusses how these different frameworks for considering fake news shed light on the relationship between scandal and the media. One final note before we move into the heart of this chapter. There is growing and justified resistance in academia to using the term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù to describe content that deliberately uses the tools and distribution mechanisms of journalism to promote demonstrably false narratives. _PERSON_ (2017) has convincingly argued that the use of the term collapses mult
iple distinct types of misinformation (some malicious, some benign) into a single category called ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù Others (_PERSON_ et. al. 2018) have categorized the diverse and often divergent definitions of fake news that have been deployed in the scholarly literature. Still others contend that the use of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù by the U.S. President _NAME_ has transformed the concept into an utterly vacuous one, a concept often used to criticize legitimate accountability journalism and one increasingly deployed by authoritarian leaders of all stripes. We agree in principle with all these criticisms. And yet, in this chapter, we continue to use the term ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù Our decision here is primarily one of authorial strategy. In essence, it is entirely possible to spend thousands of words arguing about the proper definition of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and spend very little time conducting empirical work about the phenomenon, or thinking more deeply about the ways it has been used in research to date. To avoid definitional 
parsing, we deploy the term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù here while agreeing entirely with the criticism that its use is problematic. At the very least, accepting the common usage of the term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù allows us to turn more quickly to some of the ways it has been used, and misused, and under-used in academic research so far. Thinking about fake news in terms of intellectual misunderstandings or oversights allows us also to connect it with larger theories of scandal, media, and the public sphere. Four misunderstandings of fake news We argue that there are four ways to understand and misunderstand fake news as a research concept. First, we often think of fake news as words on a page rather than images or other forms of visual content. Second, we often become intellectually trapped between trying to distinguish between journalism as ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù information, when it might be more productive to think of journalism as facts embedded within narratives. Third, we often think about the content of fake news its
elf‚Äîwhat it says and what it does to the public‚Äîrather than considering the institutional processes by which fake news is produced. Finally, we often fail to consider fake news in a comparative context, which has the added advantage of promoting a highly ‚ÄúWestern-centric‚Äù notion of the idea of fake news. Emotional, aesthetic and visual aspects of fake news In recent years, experts in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States seem increasingly mystified by the decisions made by voters‚Äîdecisions that appear to upend expectations about what are the ‚Äúbest‚Äù possible political actions, or at least the most rational ones. While not put quite this straightforwardly, journalistic and scholarly explanations for these so-called ‚Äúirrational political choices‚Äù have gone something like this: building on a variety of digital affordances, the information environment that is powering the political public sphere in the West has become overwhelmed by a variety of propagandistic, divisive, and emotional
ly resonant (but factually untrue) forms of information. The presence of this (mis)information led to particular political outcomes, outcomes in part attributable to the impact of media on individual voters. In the most common version of this story, Facebook (and, to a lesser degree, Twitter) allowed a series of propagandistic and untrue pieces of information to flood its systems and lead people to make the ‚Äúwrong choice‚Äù when the time came to vote for a president or make a choice in a national referendum. More legacy newspapers and media outlets, particularly in the United Kingdom, have also come under fire for ‚Äúplaying the fear card‚Äù when it comes to their coverage of important issues. Bundled into this story are a particular (and interrelated) set of assumptions about the nature of politics, the affordances of digital media, and the manner in which information affects human behavior. There are three problems with these assumptions. First, they rely on a set of theories about what the media ‚Äúdoes‚
Äù to audiences that have been widely debunked in the communications literature. Second, they have a narrow understanding of ‚Äúthe media‚Äù that sees that media as made up of relatively unitary pieces of informational content. This understanding ignores the aesthetic content of the media, and indeed relegates the entire concept of visual news media to a second-tier status. Both these problems create a third, which is that we too often talk about the relationship between media and politics in narrow, overly social scientific terms, ignoring the range of other intellectual perspectives that could be brought to bear on these relationships. We have noted that one major perspective missing from the conversation about fake news has been a visual aesthetic perspective, one that draws more on concepts from art history and art appreciation than it does from social science or even from media studies. The major work on the role of visual content in contributing to the fake news phenomenon (e.g. Guy 2017) has largely be
en exploratory in nature; beyond that, it has largely adopted a behavioralist perspective on fake news, looking at what images ‚Äúdo‚Äù to the public and how to identify them as being either fake or true. This, however, is not the only way to think about visuals in journalism. In just the last few years visual communication scholars and social semioticians have become more broadly interested in the aesthetics of news media, specifically with regards to the relationship between imagery, graphics, layout, and writing in a digital context. In particular, _NAME_, _NAME_, and _PERSON_ have offered compelling social semiotic analyses of key visual and multimodal news media genres like, for example, online news galleries, newsbites, and news opening sequences. There is no reason why these perspectives could not be brought to bear on the question of fake news. Truth, lies and narratives While media and communications scholars have looked primarily at news as information and have built compelling arguments about the p
oisoning of the public well by fake news, a few sociologists have devoted themselves to understanding the cultural, emotional, and narratival roots of the current ‚Äúcrisis in public communication‚Äù (_PERSON_ and _PERSON_ 1995). _NAME_s work on the ‚Äúdeep story‚Äù in Strangers in Their Own Land‚Äîthe way that the story Tea Party activists in Louisiana told themselves about the current state of American political and economic life influenced their political choices‚Äîhas been central to this conversation. For _PERSON_ (2016), the roots of the populist upsurge in politics do not lie in economic distress as much as they lie in a story about economic distress. Conservatives in the United States imagine social life as a line, at the end of which is something called the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream.‚Äù Not only has this line slowed to a crawl, in the minds of these _PERSON_ supporters, but a variety of minority groups and immigrants have been cutting to the front of the line, aided and abetted by corrupt and swindling polit
icians. What lies at the root of populism, for _PERSON_, is not the deployment of incorrect facts but rather the construction of particular mediated narratives. In terms more familiar to scholars of communication, journalism, and media studies, journalism and news‚Äîwhether fake or truthful‚Äîplay a ritualistic role in constructing the everyday lives of citizens, and not simply an informational role. News, in _NAME_ terms, can be seen as a dramaturgical exercise. ""What is arrayed before the reader is not pure information but a portrayal of the contending forces in the world,"" _NAME_ wrote in 1985. ""Moreover, as readers make their way through the paper, they engage in a continual shift of roles or of dramatic focus."" Fake news, it can be argued, helps establish these terms of dramatic reference and a vision of the world in which contending forces of good and evil populate a world of conflict, treachery, scandal, and betrayal. While such a ritualistic perspective does not dispense with the difference betwee
n ‚Äúfacts‚Äù and ‚Äúlies,‚Äù it de-emphasizes the importance of truth as the sole vector along which we ought to analyze fake news and digital propaganda. Fake news as content, fake news as production Little attention, finally, has been devoted to the means by which fake news is actually made and by which it operates as a form of cultural labor. For instance, a timely BuzzFeed analysis in early November 2016 (Silverman 2016) determined that ‚Äúfake news‚Äù on Facebook generated significantly larger amounts of audience engagement than the top stories of the 19 most popular traditional news organizations combined. The Computational Propaganda Project at the Oxford Internet Institute, which actually began well before the 2016 election, has generated studies about a wide variety of disinformation campaigns in cross-national contexts, beginning with the analysis of ‚ÄúBrexit Bots‚Äù on Twitter and later expanding the analysis to include bot activity and propaganda on Facebook, Wikipedia, and elsewhere. These stud
ies are incredibly valuable as well as being methodologically sophisticated; they demonstrate the degree to which misinformation and outright propaganda have colonized the journalistic space and hypothesize a causal connection between the irrationality of our current political discourse and the actions of malevolent information actors (e.g., _NAME_ 2017; Wooley & Guilbeault 2017). A related 2016 American election study, carried out by the Berkman-Klein Center at Harvard University, looks at the interactions between hundreds of media outlets and the patterns of information circulation that dominated election coverage. The study concludes that, while centrist/liberal media in the United States are now virtually synonymous with legacy media outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN, conservative media space is dominated by a variety of dubious quasi-journalistic actors, particularly Breitbart News. Much like the work on computational propaganda, however, the Berkman study looks at surface-lev
el media interactions and conceives of ‚Äúnews content‚Äù as primarily ‚Äúinformation‚Äù (_NAME_ et. al 2017). More than that, all these studies examine the work that this content does in the world, and the way it affects citizens. Survey-based approaches may also tend to flatten out differences when they draw false equivalences among disinformation actors and content as they manifest in diverse cultural contexts (e.g., _NAME_ 2017) while technology-centric approaches may fetishize new technologies and overstate their social effects without situating these within broader media environments and historical campaign infrastructures (e.g., Woolley & Guilbeault 2017). Digital disinformation in the Philippines To demonstrate concretely how these under-explored aspects of fake news might be analyzed as part of a larger analysis of the relationship between fake news and scandal, this section deploys them in discussing the study that two of us carried out on the production of digital disinformation in the Philippines 
(_PERSON_ and _PERSON_ 2018). This research was conducted from December 2016 to December 2017, in the aftermath of the campaigns for the May 2016 Philippine national elections, which saw the intensification of online political vitriol and toxicity and the rise of controversial politician _NAME_ to the country‚Äôs presidency. To shed light on the worrisome dynamics of digital disinformation in the campaigns and in the early days of the _PERSON_ regime, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 of those we refer to as disinformation architects who did ‚Äúpolitical trolling‚Äù and produced ‚Äúfake news‚Äù for politicians across the Philippines‚Äô political spectrum and at both the national and local levels. This included six chief disinformation architects who were elite advertising and PR strategists managing digital disinformation campaigns, five anonymous digital influencers who were aspirational middle-class digital workers operating anonymous accounts that commanded followers of 50,000 and above on Facebook 
and Twitter, and nine community-level fake account operators who were precarious middle-class digital workers sharing and amplifying core campaign messages in the online communities and Facebook groups they had infiltrated. To supplement these interviews, we also conducted participant observations of over 20 publicly accessible Facebook groups and pages and Twitter accounts supporting various political camps‚Äîincluding those that were explicitly pro- and _PERSON_‚Äîas well as those that had no explicit representation of candidates or political parties, but who claimed to curate ‚Äúsocial media news.‚Äù Disinformation as a visual One innovation we proposed for how to conceptualize fake news in research better was for us to approach it not just as a text but also as a visual. Indeed, looking at the visual elements of the materials produced by disinformation architects in the Philippines reveals one of the strategies that underpin their campaigns. Here we refer to the need to translate the technical language of 
campaign objectives into social media posts that are imbued with authenticity. To do this, the disinformation architects include visuals that weaponize popular vernaculars, or the aesthetic and semiotic resources that predominate and circulate in Filipino popular culture. This kind of digital disinformation production builds on the existing logics and process of political marketing that is premised on the recognition that ordinary citizens have the agency and ability to interpret or even reject persuasive marketing messages handed down from above by political elites (_PERSON_ 2014). As such, it aims to establish a reciprocal relationship between brands and publics that takes seriously their interests, needs, and emotional responses. A crucial part of this relationship is establishing a strong connection with people‚Äôs ‚Äúemotional literacies‚Äù (Corner and _PERSON_ 2003) or ‚Äúaffective intelligences‚Äù (_NAME_ 2005). These are specific rationalities that guide their engagement with the political sphere that 
stem from personal experiences and cultural narratives they know and, crucially, feel. A concrete example of how disinformation producers tried to imbue visuals with an aesthetic of authenticity can be seen in memes deployed for digital black ops, a technique used to attack the character of opposing politicians. Take for instance this misogynistic meme that sought to undermine the credibility of _PERSON_, who is currently an assistant secretary in the Presidential Communications Operations Office. _PERSON_ is a favorite target of _PERSON_ campaigns because she has been one of the most visible and most vocal _PERSON_ key opinion leaders online. This particular meme amplified other similar digital disinformation materials that aimed to continually dredge up _PERSON_‚Äôs past career as a controversy-seeking sexy star. It shamed her by harping on about conservative Filipino tropes about womanhood by showing provocative images of her and insinuating that she is not ‚Äúdisente‚Äù (decent) and so should not be belie
ved. Key to establishing authenticity in this ‚Äú_PERSON_ meme‚Äù was its deliberately amateurish aesthetics. To deflect the fact that this meme comes out of a professionalized disinformation production architecture, it consisted of photographs that were awkwardly cropped, had text fonts with an odd color scheme, and an overall layout that decidedly did not adhere to the rule of thirds. Also important for the meme‚Äôs authenticity was the use of images that sought to resonate with the broad public, as they were drawn from popular tropes in Philippine entertainment media. The photograph to its left was of the television and young film superstar _NAME_, who is posited to embody the qualities of the supporters of _PERSON_‚Äôs rival presidential candidate _PERSON_. What this image referenced in particular was how _NAME_ was a wildly popular young celebrity who was acutely aware of how she should act in public because, as she put it, ‚Äúwe have to do our best to become good role models for the youth‚Äù (_PERSON_ 2
018). In stark contrast was _PERSON_s photograph to the meme‚Äôs right, whose indecency is said to capture key qualities of _PERSON_‚Äôs supporters. This image connected especially well with the accusations that in bringing her controversial sexy star persona to her new government job, _PERSON_ was trading in so-called political porn‚Äî‚Äúthe immersion in obscenity, the choreographed assault on the real in favor of the fantasy, [and] the repeated appeal to the prurient‚Äù (_PERSON_ 2018)‚Äîand consequently irresponsibly debasing the quality of public discussion. Approaching disinformation materials as a visual is clearly helpful in unpacking how disinformation architects can weaponize aesthetic and semiotic resources. The case of the ‚ÄúMocha meme,‚Äù for instance, crystallized the deployment of authenticity through the popular vernaculars of amateur design and Philippine entertainment media tropes. At the same time, however, the analysis above also points to another dynamic at play. That is, disinformation m
aterials cannot be understood in isolation. The ‚ÄúMocha meme‚Äù was certainly embedded within broader narratives of social drama, such as the value of amateur voices over professional voices in the digital public sphere or of decency over indecency for women in the public eye. Disinformation and narratives Building on from the point above, we now want to evidence the value of approaching fake news not just as clear-cut ‚Äútruth‚Äù and ‚Äúlies,‚Äù as assertions of facts embedded within social narratives. For this we will mention one of the most notorious digital disinformation campaigns in the aftermath of President _PERSON_‚Äôs victory. Known as the ‚ÄúIlibing Na‚Äù (which roughly translates as ‚ÄúAllow the Burial‚Äù) campaign, this was the highly organized push for historical revisionism to sanitize the brutal dictatorship of former President _NAME_ and, consequently, pave the way for his burial in the ‚ÄúLibingan ng mga Bayani‚Äù (Cemetery for Heroes). In the interim between _PERSON_‚Äôs order and the Supr
eme Court decision and the eventual burial of _NAME_, we followed the Facebook and Twitter discussions around the ‚Äú_PERSON_ Na‚Äù campaign. We observed how the disinformation architects ensured that social media served as an integral platform within a wider political campaign, as it echoed and amplified the revisionist narrative of _NAME_ as the Philippines‚Äô greatest president and the martial law years as the country‚Äôs golden years. This went completely against established historical and literary scholarship that described the dictatorial regime as characterized by, among other horrors, widespread human rights violations and unmitigated government corruption (see _PERSON_ 2016). Moreover, and here we borrow from _PERSON_ (2016), this narrative aligned very well with the ""deep story"" held by _PERSON_ and his supporters regarding the viability of an authoritarian regime, as it would get the country to move forward faster. As _PERSON_ himself said, _NAME_ deserved to be buried ‚Äúbecause he was a great p
resident and he was a hero‚Äù and, moreover, that the burial would catalyze ‚Äúnational healing.‚Äù The children of _NAME_ also echoed this claim, saying that what the country really needed was to ‚Äúforgive and move on.‚Äù During our research, we saw how online petitions, memes, videos, and articles from websites with unverified content were weaponized to challenge existing narratives about _NAME_ and bring different frameworks to the burial issue. Crucially, these were also used to attack and silence critics of the burial. One such example was a Facebook post about Vice President _PERSON_‚Äôs opposition to the burial. If _PERSON_ was a favorite target of the _PERSON_ camp, so _PERSON_ was always in the firing line of the _PERSON_ camp. This was primarily because she was the highest government official affiliated with the Liberal Party, which not only touted itself as the opposition party to the _PERSON_ government but was also a key opposition force during the _NAME_ regime. The Facebook post shared a news 
video clip of _PERSON_‚Äôs interview with the accompanying caption: ‚ÄúSo why does _PERSON_ the queen of cheap campaigns disapprove of the burial of _NAME_ in the Heroes‚Äô Cemetery ‚Ä¶ Watch and learn how crazy and out of her mind _PERSON_ is.‚Äù The post elicited over 16,000 reactions (likes, hearts, angry reactions), 28,624 shares, and over 7,200 comments, with the video viewed over 1 million times. The deep story carried by the post seemed to have resonated very well with the supporters of _PERSON_, as many of the comments on the post expressed their support for the revisionist narrative about _NAME_, specifically by throwing a disturbing array of expletives at _PERSON_. They called her a ‚Äú*****,‚Äù ‚Äústupid,‚Äù ‚Äúinsane,‚Äù told her to ‚Äúshut up,‚Äù and went as far as wishing she would die along with her three daughters. They also expressed resentment towards the Liberal Party, which they characterized as the evil enemy of the _PERSON_ presidency. We subsequently asked the disinformation architects 
about the toxic and vitriolic commentaries generated by digital disinformation materials like the Facebook post against _PERSON_. Their response to this was to wash their hands and explain away their responsibility. Unfortunately, the distinct architecture of networked disinformation in the Philippines made it easy for them to do this. It is to this that we next shift our attention. Disinformation as cultural production The third innovation we proposed above was to conceptualize fake news not just as mere content but as an instantiation of organizational processes and labor relations. Our study on digital disinformation in the Philippines, for instance, took a production studies approach that examined disinformation as a culture of production, which meant listening to the intentions and experiences of fake news producers in their own words and attending to their ""creativity within constraints"" (_PERSON_ 2009: 2) in light of opaque institutional procedures. This enabled us to develop an account of the disinf
ormation production process that was inherently social, underscoring how the different architects of disinformation _NAME_ from institutional knowledge, professional skills, and interpersonal relationships when innovating techniques of political deception. Our production studies approach allowed us to see the different ways in which disinformation architects engaged in moral justifications. They employed various denial strategies that allowed them to claim that their work was not actually ‚Äútrolling‚Äù or ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and that, crucially, enabled them to displace moral responsibility for the consequences of digital disinformation on the heightened toxicity and vitriol of contemporary online political discussions. We observed that workers _NAME_ from slightly different cultural scripts when justifying their work based on where they are positioned in the professional hierarchy. Take the chief disinformation architects, for instance. They saw themselves as taking on the more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù work of crafti
ng campaign objectives and messages, especially when compared to the anonymous digital influencers who had to do the ‚Äúdirty‚Äù work of translating their objectives and messages into actual social media content. This allowed them to create some psychological distance from the actual production of digital disinformation materials. Together with this, they did not see digital disinformation as something new, arguing instead that they had used the same advertising and public relations techniques in orchestrating the launch of Facebook business pages, making hashtag campaigns trend worldwide, and building engaged communities for household brands, telecommunications companies, or celebrities. As one of them put it, ‚ÄúWhether you're a movie, soft drink, restaurant, or politician, it's all the same to me. Just give me the brief, I know what to do.‚Äù For the anonymous digital influencers, meanwhile, the casual and short-term nature of disinformation projects meant that they could downplay their involvement in it. 
Because the work was just one project or ‚Äúsideline‚Äù they juggle among others, they could tell themselves that ""fake news"" does not define their whole identity. One of them explained, ‚ÄúBeing a character or a ‚Äòpseudo‚Äô is only very fleeting because you are not the person. You just assume that personality. You trend for a while and then move on.‚Äù The other thing is that the digital influencers were adamant in saying that the production of actual fake news and other disinformation content was not their handiwork, but that of unnamed others in the disinformation architecture or of ‚Äúreal supporters‚Äù from the grassroots. They said that it is these others who were overly zealous, as they themselves were professional enough not to engage in misogyny, racism, and hate. This justification allowed them to displace perpetually any accountability for the grimier aspects of disinformation production. Disinformation from the south Finally, we suggest that our understanding of fake news should go beyond ‚ÄúWe
stern-centric‚Äù lenses and take a global and comparative approach to disinformation production. Our study on digital disinformation production in the Philippines was certainly inspired by the challenge posed by _NAME_ and _NAME_ (2017) to trace the historical antecedents of mediatized populism in particular. We took seriously the importance of thinking through how new social media affordances for political exchange‚Äîsuch as the currently toxic and vitriolic online public spheres in many established democracies‚Äîmap onto entrenched political systems, class hierarchies, and social dynamics in developing countries like the Philippines, which has deep histories of populist sentiment. Paying attention to the historical context of the Philippines allowed us to understand, for instance, the _NAME_ of the country‚Äôs advertising and public relations-led architecture of networked disinformation. This had to do with how national politics in the Philippines has always been characterized by weak political party ideolo
gies and affiliations that are completely overwhelmed by strong personalistic relationships with presidential contenders who are perceived to possess the right image branding (_PERSON_ 1998; _PERSON_ 2004). And the roots of this ran deep, what with Philippine politics having been shaped by a culture of patronage between an oligarchic elite and supporters who establish relationships of dependency and obligation with them. Growing out of a system of patron‚Äìclient relations established during the Spanish colonial period (1521‚Äì1898), the country‚Äôs powerful political families and personalities have continued to cultivate clientelistic relationships with their loyal followers (_PERSON_ and _PERSON_ 2000). Looking at the particular digital labor conditions in the Philippines also enabled us to see how the architecture of network disinformation was heavily entrenched in systematized labor and incentive structures that have been normalized in, and even professionalized by, the creative and digital industries. On
e thing we saw was that the chief disinformation architects sought to exploit the porous boundaries between advertising and public relations and the digital underground. They used their expertise and leadership in the former to gain power and prestige in the latter, thereby establishing themselves as pioneers of a new industry. The other thing we observed was that many of the anonymous digital influencers got dragged into the digital underground because of the precarious work conditions in mainstream media. After compounded experiences of rejection and exploitation at the hands of the media industry, they found themselves seeking financial stability in digital disinformation work. Using this case study of disinformation in the Philippines as a test upon which to ground grand narratives usually developed and deployed in the West enabled us to see that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the complex problem of digital disinformation. Global initiatives to address the problem, such as the emerging critical 
scholarship on the operations of power by global corporations such as Facebook and Google, are of course important (see _PERSON_ 2017). At the same time, however, understanding local contexts of disinformation production and the ways that architects of disinformation evade responsibility and entice other workers to join them in the digital underground allows us to craft better bespoke interventions that are suited to specific country contexts. For the Philippines, our suggestions included the following. (1) Addressing the development of a self-regulatory commission that requires disclosure of political consultancies is a step towards encouraging the traceability and accountability of these digital campaigns within the advertisement and PR industry. (2) Create industry sanctions and safety nets that prevent precarious creative workers from slipping into the digital underground. Conclusion and discussion: Fake news and scandal We argued in the opening section of this chapter that de-Westernizing and broadening 
our understanding of fake news to include issues of narrative, cultural production, and aesthetics can help us better link the fake news phenomenon to larger issues of media sociology, including the role of scandal in the public sphere. In this concluding discussion we mount a brief intervention in order to demonstrate the productivity of this approach. We want to tie the previous case study to larger issues of public space, visibility, and scandal, and in doing so begin a rapprochement between questions of fake news and larger theoretical questions. Media sociologist _NAME_ has offered the most robust and theoretically sophisticated analysis of the relationship between the twenty-first-century media system and political scandal (_PERSON_ 2004), focusing on the relationship between scandal and the media‚Äôs power to make select individuals visible to the public at large (_PERSON_ 2005). There are two strands to _PERSON_‚Äôs argument, each tying into a different set of assumptions about the nature of communica
tion and the political world. The first strand is grounded in a critique of _NAME_ and his concept of ‚Äúpanopticonism,‚Äù or the notion that society has created an internalized sense of continuous surveillance at the heart of modern subjectivity. With his concept of the panopticon, _PERSON_ argues, _PERSON_ neglects to consider the role of the media and particularly its ability to engineer certain forms of public visibility that are limited to a (relatively) few individuals. Rather than living in a state of continuous visibility, _PERSON_ contends (contra _PERSON_) the media draws its very power from its ability to make certain people visible at certain times (_PERSON_ 2005, 40‚Äì42). One of the forms of media visibility arises via scandal, which is itself related to certain changes in the constitution of politics. _PERSON_ (2013) relates the prevalence of scandal in recent times to the decline of traditional political parties with their stable and class-based patterns of allegiance. The new political models 
that tend to dominate campaigns use the personal ethics and conduct of individual politicians as a means by which to lure increasingly non-committed voters to their side. One way to do this is via scandal, which simultaneously taints the moral character of politicians and virtually guarantees that this moral character will become the subject of heightened media visibility. Political scandal thus stems from larger changes in both the political and media sphere, with the media possessing increased power to make individuals visible and with politics as a game through which to lure the large number of uncommitted voters to a political side. _PERSON_‚Äôs analysis, one of the few large-scale sociological theories to take the media seriously, is a compelling one that does much to explain the dynamics of modern mediated politics. We also think that it both illuminates and obscures the role played by ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in the development of media scandals in the digital age. In terms of illumination, we can see from our 
case study that, even in our hyper-partisan age, moral judgments about candidates for office and politicians in the public sphere still matter. One of the major strategies of disinformation teams in the Philippines, as we have seen, is to impugn the morality of government officials, particularly women. It is an open question as to whether this is a localized phenomenon or a general one, but either way this analysis of the Philippines demonstrates that fake news can thrive in an environment where moral judgments play a major role in political life. Fake news and disinformation can publicly unearth the (usually false) inner lives of candidates, constructing a (false) media narrative that turns government officials into moral reprobates. On the other hand, some part of the conceptual cloudiness of _PERSON_‚Äôs theory in relationship to the fake news phenomenon stems, not from a flaw in the theory, but rather from a media landscape which is dramatically different than it was even a decade ago. For one thing, we t
hink that the _PERSON_ notion of the panopticon is more valid now than it was when _PERSON_ proposed it, and certainly more valid than it was when _PERSON_ constructed his theory of media power. The endlessly proliferating world of digital and social media has created a system in which many of the most energized citizens are quite literally ‚Äúbathing‚Äù in the media flow at all times; media is not simply a medium, as Mark _PERSON_ argues, but might be better seen as a media life (_PERSON_ 2012). We can see this from our Philippines case study insofar as disinformation strategies assume an always surveilled, quantified public. Metrics, surveillance, and tracking (_NAME_ 2013) play a major role in fake news strategies and the flourishing of scandalous fake news. Regardless of the specifics at play in this particular case, we think the fake news concept is in need of an overhaul. In this chapter we have outlined the aspects of the phenomenon we think should be more emphasized in scholarship going forward. We ha
ve tried to demonstrate the utility of these revisions in our case study of the role played by disinformation workers in the Philippines. Finally, we have shown how broadening our understanding of fake news takes us out of a linear, media-effects model of communication. Instead, it allows us to discuss disinformation in relationship to more supple sociological theories, including scandal, the public sphere, and personal visibility in media space. Such conceptual creativity is necessary if we are to continue to integrate the dramatic changes of twenty-first-century mediated life with older, and still robust, frameworks for understanding the media‚Äôs relationship with society.

I use to party like an animal. 3-4 nights a week I lived with my bro who hosted house parties quite often. It was the best time in my life, probably that I‚Äôll ever get. I miss hanging out with that crowd, and my diagnosis had a lot to do with that. It sucks to feel like you have no one to talk to. Reaching out in a very public way seems to me like a bad idea. It could go wrong and even if someone tries to assist, the interaction won‚Äôt have any substance to it. Call your local mental health crisis line. I‚Äôll be the first to tell you, sometimes they suck, incredibly so. But most of the time when i call them, they help me a lot and are willing to talk to me and feel like I‚Äôm an okay person."

I think it might have been a delusion because I've had something similar that others have told me was a delusion and trying to reality test it, my chair isn't wet, my clothes aren't wet or dirty, etc. I get all sorts of delusions. Actually maybe that was a hallucination. A tactile one. I'm not sure. Anyway, I'm pretty sure it didn't happen though it felt very real at the time. Very convincing."

I also cannot get high or drunk. I can feel a small buzz for a couple of days but then i‚Äôd have to stop for a day or two to get the same effects. I read one guy took 6.5 months to get mildly drunk and really really high again, one guy 5 months to get drunk, one guy I think a year to get drunk, and one girl 11 months to get high again. I‚Äôm curious to know how long it took people be able to get high and drunk again and how long it took for the libido and ejaculate issues to return to normal."

Effexor is an SNRI. It does have anti-anxiety properties but it is also good for depression. It is kind of uplifting so maybe it wouldn't be as good for anxiety. I have taken Xanax for years now so I am really not sure how much it helped me with anxiety. I think it is worth giving it a try. Being it is SNRI, it had less side effect for me than an SSRI. Let us know if you try it and how it works for you. Often these types of medications take longer to work. Though it may help with the anxiety quicker. Best wishes... _PERSON_, _NAME_...

174329933,"I'm a male who's almost 30. In the last few days, I found out that 9(?) members of my family have experienced hallucinations and/or delusions. They're all highly functional, have never been medicated, treated, or diagnosed for schizophrenia. Apart from them telling me they've had these symptoms, I wouldn't have suspected schiz*-associated impairments. That is, they seem normal (after accounting for autism, bipolar, etc.) As far as I can remember, I've never had delusions or hallucinations, except some due to a sleep disorder (confusional arousal). I had a brain MRI a few years ago for a different reason. Out of curiosity, I looked at my images. This is what I found: ... _USER_ID_: I can't post a link, because I'm new. But, it's on imgur as zTCpz3Z.jpg ... Clearly enlarged ventricles. So, what does that mean for me? I spent perhaps hours looking for information on enlarged ventricles, and how that relates to likelihood of onset and psychosis. I wasn't able to find that info. I did find this: suppose
dly, new-onset schizophrenics and ""ultra-high risk"" patients have near-normal ventricles. Mine are clearly abnormal, and yet I'm free of hallucinations, etc. I do however experience anhedonia, chronic derealization, and some other associated symptoms. I'd never be diagnosed on this basis though, because I have comorbid autism; so, the DSM-5 would require delusions and/or hallucinations (as I recall). Also note: obviously, I'm not medicated. ... In short, why am I not experiencing debilitating impairment or any psychosis? And is it almost certain that I will, given my MRI?"

174329948,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Depressive psychopathology in first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review, _NAME_-analysis and _NAME_-regression. SE _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Wood, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ Cotton, Psychological medicine , Sep 2019 16 Despite knowing for many decades that depressive psychopathology is common in first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders (FES), there is limited knowledge regarding the extent and nature of such psychopathology (degree of comorbidity, caseness, severity) and its demographic, clinical, functional and treatment correlates. This study aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of depressive disorder and caseness, and the pooled mean severity of depressive symptoms, as well as the demographic, illness, functional and treatment correlates of depressive psychopathology in FES.This systematic review, _NAME_-analysis and _NAME_-regression was prospectively registered (CRD42018084856) and conducted in accordance with PRISMA and MO
OSE guidelines.Forty studies comprising 4041 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of depressive disorder and caseness was 26.0% (seven samples, N = 855, 95% CI 22.1-30.3) and 43.9% (11 samples, N = 1312, 95% CI 30.3-58.4), respectively. The pooled mean percentage of maximum depressive symptom severity was 25.1 (38 samples, N = 3180, 95% CI 21.49-28.68). Correlates of depressive psychopathology were also found.At least one-quarter of individuals with FES will experience, and therefore require treatment for, a full-threshold depressive disorder. Nearly half will experience levels of depressive symptoms that are severe enough to warrant diagnostic investigation and therefore clinical intervention - regardless of whether they actually fulfil diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. Depressive psychopathology is prominent in FES, manifesting not only as superimposed comorbidity, but also as an inextricable symptom domain."

It‚Äôs the long run that distracting will help too. Plainly put, it‚Äôs good to have experiences even if it‚Äôs just walking around the block.

I became racist against jews because I thought I was Jesus and that they are trying to kill me by putting radioactive poison on my thermos and cups. I was desinfecting everything with alcohol. I also spoke nonsense about politics and _NAME_ terrorists. The agent asked me what does _NAME_ represent for me and if I knew ppl in Syria. I am Syrian. They thought I was a terrorist and part of _NAME_. My brothers told him that I am SZic and I am not taking my meds. They told me to not do this again and to take my pills. I took my meds and stopped again, I was crying for hours from psychosis, I thought my brother was choking me. My parents called 911 and 2 police cars with 4 policemans came to take me to mental hospital. I was in boxers and they even watched me putting my cloths on. They said they can‚Äôt leave me alone."

174329971,"I remember reading the bible, bad idea, i started thinking the bible was prophecising me lol. Its a delusion for sure, i didnt snap out of it until a few months of meds. The thoughts will pass eventually, especially after you accept that you have schizophrenia. Im still accepting my illness. What ap are you taking?"
175904445,"I have not been here in a while, but I am doing terrible so thought I would stop in since you all have been helpful in the past. My anxiety seems to follow a pretty consistent pattern: I do something (or say something, or make some decision), then I regret it, and I castigate myself for my ""mistake,"" and then I worry -- very intensely -- about the consequences. Often this worry takes up literally every waking minute -- I am in a constant state of stress/worry, and sleep is my only respite. Then, eventually, it will subside, and I will be OK for a month or two, until the next ""mistake""... For a long time, I thought this was some sort of general anxiety, but more recently it has been diagnosed (by a very talented therapist) as OCD. It is not exactly the typical form of OCD, but the therapist explained to me how it is OCD. The ""obsession"" is whatever mistake I made and the worry I have about its consequences. And the ""compulsion"" is what I do to try to make myself feel better -- such as asking 
others for reassurance, or doing a lot of research to try to understand the likely consequences. Some of the most intense worries I have are when I do something that can harm my health. I am experiencing one such episode now, and I am really suffering badly. It is just about the worst I have ever felt. I would go into more details about what my ""mistake"" was -- but that would be a form of ""seeking reassurance"" and the therapy I am trying (ERP) requires me to expose myself repeatedly to the worries I have and then NOT to do my usual response -- which is seeking reassurance. So for that reason I won't go into the details here. Anyway, I am really suffering and in terrible emotional pain. In the past, these things have tended to subside in a week or so. But this one is more serious -- and the risk to my health much more severe -- and I don't know how I will get over it. For now, I am taking my therapist's advice. I made a tape recording describing my mistake, and my self-criticism, and my worries -- and I li
sten to the recording over and over and over again. That is the ""exposure"" part of ERP. It is counter-intuitive, but the literature suggests its the best treatment for OCD. I might try meds too, but I am trying this first. Wish me luck. Please."
175904446,"Well... I suspect lots of us, here on PC, talk to our teddy bears. And probably lots of us hear them cry & talk to us in our heads. So I don't know that there's anything particularly unusual about that. Talking to your teddys (or other stuffies) can even be therapeutic. (Of course, you didn't mention what you're hearing your teddy bears say to you. That would certainly make a difference.) You wrote that it's scary but comforting. Perhaps the question may be... is it more scary or more comforting. If it's mostly comforting then maybe there isn't anything to be done? However if it's more scary then perhaps the thing to do is to talk this over with whatever mental health professionals you have in your life... psychologist, mental health therapist, etc. Perhaps other PC members will have other thoughts on the subject."

174329967,I successfully implemented a healthcare plan for me and got it approved by my doctor. I am going back to the pills from the injection. 15mg / day of Abilify I can go up to 20mg in 10 days if I need it. Wondering whether I should go train at this new place at my work to get more hours. They‚Äôre cutting my hours and idk why. I guess it could be because I left without telling a supervisor when I had a legitimate medical issue going on (inj wore off too soon). Anyway it‚Äôs in the past and now I know what to do. No one told me. I still disagree with their rules. I like the job though. Gets me outta the house and puts $$$ in my pocket.
174329972,"I was only on Vraylar for a week and in a psych ward and we titrated up from 1.5 to 3 to 4.5 over that week. I get insomnia from the phenelzine though, and the Vraylar was so stimulating it made me feel like I was on something (not unpleasantly so mind you) so we switched to Abilify. I had come in on Zyprexa and was originally depending on that to help me sleep, and it‚Äôs a long story but they wanted me to only take Seroquel to sleep and when I started getting bad side effects from it they gave me nothing else and I went sleep deprived for a good while. Jerks. It was mostly the D3 receptor effects that I would notice on the Vraylar, intensifying and then dying down. It made everything look extra sharp and clear and vibrant and made spatial dimensions stand out more strongly and energize me and make me super alert."
174329976,Well clozapine doesn‚Äôt come in injections either and the doc was considering prescribing it
175904451,"All the time. It‚Äôs part of my OCD though so mt doubts about myself run real deep. The beat thing I‚Äôve done to help myself is finding alternative explanations instead of being a fake. Like for example at one point I was convinced I was faking sza, even though my symptoms are clearly real, so I figured out that all my behaviors j worried were faking were in fact ways to get validation because OCD causes me to seek reassurance all the time. Idk if this helps but just know lots of people feel this way here. It could be delusional too."
175904452,"I used to have this problem but it got less when I started taking L-theanine. It finally went away (more or less) when I increased the dose of my AP. Normally the best and worst of a situation never arise , it‚Äôs normally something in the middle."

These went away after a little while. I no longer get crazy mood swings or intrusive thoughts of wanting to die. I have only had 2 depressive episodes since starting it (I used to get them ALL the time, as many as 12 a year!) And they were very mild compared to how they are off depakote, so it also greatly reduces severity. I love depakote. Dosage: I‚Äôm on what I believe is the lowest therapeutic dose, 500 mg. I am very sensitive to psych meds so this works great for me. Other people may need higher doses and depakote is associated with side effects at higher doses. Desirable effects: No more mood swings, no more suicidal intrusive thoughts, greatly reduced frequency and severity of depressive episodes Undesirable effects: some stomach cramps starting it but these went away eventually I now get no bad side effects"

175904475,"I frequent a religious organization in my city. There I contacted one of the priest for advice on my schizophrenia. After months visiting him once or twice a week, he attempted the following actions that I found curious. First, we establish that my hallucinated characters are present, that is I see them right that moment. Second, the priest asks me to describe the character that I see. His questions were along the following lines. Is it male or female (female in my case)? What colour of hair? How is the nose shaped? Is there lipstick? What kind of dress? Is there earrings? If no, are there scars from piercing in the ears? What kind of shoes? Eventually he stops me and tells me the following. I wasn‚Äôt looking at the spot where I supposedly see the character. Therefore, I draw descriptions from my imagination. Therefore the character is a product of my imagination and is not real. For me personally, this is only the quarter of the entire story that is still ongoing. I won‚Äôt go into details unless 
requested. The important part is that experiment, as he called it. Most if not all schizophreniacs struggle to understand that the threat and paranoia that they perceive is completely false. I wonder if this tiny trick I described might help someone."

Weighted and standardized mean differences (WMDs/SMDs) and risk ratio (RR)¬±95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Nine RCTs (n=630) with double-blind design were identified. Reboxetine outperformed placebo in improving negative (9 RCTs, n=602, 
SMD: -0.47 [95% CI: -0.87, -0.07], p=0.02; I2=82%), but not the overall, positive, and general psychopathology scores. The significant therapeutic effect on negative symptoms disappeared in the sensitivity analysis after removing an outlying study and in 50% (6/12) of the subgroup analyses. Reboxetine outperformed placebo in reducing weight (3 RCTs, n=186, WMD: -3.83?kg, p=0.04; I2=92%) and body mass index (WMD: -2.23?kg/m2, p=0.04; I2=95%). Reboxetine caused dry mouth but was associated with less weight gain overall and weight gain of ?7% of the initial weight. All-cause discontinuation and other adverse events were similar between reboxetine and placebo.Adjunctive reboxetine could be useful for attenuating antipsychotic-induced weight gain, but it was not effective in treating psychopathology including negative symptoms in schizophrenia."

Many schizophrenics who commit suicide do so because the voices told them to or because they were simply tired of all the insults and emotional pain. I have personally seen a case of a cutthroat injury secondary to a suicide attempt where the schizophrenic cut his own throat becasue he was tired of the abuse. Secondly, the continued state of stress (caused by hearing malevolent voices all the time) leads to cardiovascular problems and complications including strokes and heart disease. In fact, if you check online, you‚Äôll find that cardiovascular disease is a major cause of the reduced life-expectancy of schizophrenics by 20-25 years compared to the general population‚Ä¶"

The problem is all this is overwhelming, before I did not care about anything and was very platonic, and passive. I used only to answer to questions and just watch video on youtube all day and sleep for 13 hours. Now I sleep for 8 hours and that looks plenty. I keep my head straight up when walking and making eye contact with strangers that I avoided at any cost before. Anyone can relate to it? When I will feel that this state is the normal one?"

As for impulsivity make sure its not the Abilify. Recklessness, impulsivity and addictions can be side effects of Abilify for some ppl like me my psychiatrist said.

175904689,"My 28 yr old daughter recently came very close to committing suicide because "" I am just too tired to keep trying anymore and I don't want to drag you down and be a burden to you. "" She has bipolar and borderline personality disorder. She also has _PERSON_ so has to be on immunosuppressants and thus was isolating pretty severely during Covid. She lives 3.5 hour drive from me. I knew she was starting to spiral down as she usually is a very social person, but she hid from me how bad it was. Just before Covid, she broke up with her live-in boyfriend of 4 years and moved to a new place. She also had a job she hated. In a manic phase, she spent every dime she owned and maxed out her credit card to the tune of $12,000 in just 3 months! She had never done that before. The loss of her job was the final straw. Luckily she called me crying at 2 am when she realized she was driving around looking for drugs to O.D. on I drove down and got her in to see a new psychiatrist who has adjusted her bipolar meds and 
put her on an antianxiety med. I took control of her finances and we got her a dog to be her emotional support animal. Currently, she is living with me and my husband. I continue to pay for her apartment since I feel that it shows I have faith she can get her life in order and live independently again but it is very expensive. She is very resistant to getting therapy which I believe is essential for her to deal more effectively with her bipolar and BPD. She feels she has dealt with things on her own successfully before and it was only due to Covid that her own coping mechanisms broke down. It has been about a month. How long do I give her to actually do something about getting beyond her current state? She has been looking for a new editing job but so far no luck. She has some good days and some very bad ones. I raised her to be very independent for her current dependency is making her feel very bad about herself although I try to tell her that is what family is for., to help eachother get through the bad tim
es. How long do I give her? How do you walk the line between giving support and enabling? I should mention my home environment has always been very bad for her. I live in the country and like to be quiet and am more comfortable with animals than people; she loves the city and noise and to be surrounded by people."

I don't even consider creatures like this to be the same species as me. It depends on the person, but most of them have their limits. The thing is, when they come close to reaching that limit, they sometimes want to ""have a talk"" about it. That's worse. Sometimes I feel like saying ""Can't you just blow me off without the chit chat?"" There are people who I've wanted in my life, but even with them it's sometimes nearly impossible to be ""present"" for them. Stay in the lines and come back anytime."

We conducted a systematic review on non-pharmacological interventions for preventing/reducing weight gain or increase in waist-circumference in young, newly diagnosed patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We searched major electronic databases from inception to 04/2019 on RCTs, pre- and post-test studies, and non-randomized controlled clinical trials. From a potential of 2963 hits, eight studies met the inclusion criteria (n?=?438, mean age of 18.8 (13-45) years). The interventions comprised supervised and individually adjusted aerobic exercise activities (5 studies), individua
l lifestyle counselling vs. control condition (2 RCTs), and dietetic counselling and practical training of cooking and shopping (1 study). Physical activity and practical dietetic interventions seem to be more efficient than lifestyle counselling. However, the results shall be taken with caution due to the non-randomized designs and other methodologically deficits in the majority of the included studies."

175904780,"I'm gonna take a walk around the block and listen to a song or two before I decide to sleep which really helps - You guys should try it.. It helps to clear the mind especially if you do it when it's becoming brighter (If you're in the situation like me) - I can see the clouds above the mountains, beautiful town houses and forest.. I do feel judged a little.. But it's my fault for not taking my meds exactly as prescribed. I knew how bad benzos and hypnotics are and used to be extremely conservative and tell people not to take them at all - Then I became slightly more liberal about them and took just one every few days, weeks or months.. Then I took one every day. At least it's not abuse of them which I wouldn't do - Yet it causes significant suffering. I try to be positive in all of it and focus on my life and the world.. But what's happening in the world isn't good and is effecting my mental health. But I'm still very positive. I use the late nights to reflect on myself and to try and not waste tim
e to instead research things, play music, etc.. My sleep schedule is slightly tilted though so that's the main reason. I took the Vyvanse at 3-4pm and it lasts ~10 hours. If I woke up at 10am, it would have kicked in by 11am and I would have had it worn off by 9-10pm and I could sleep at 12am.. But I like to stay up until 2am usually.. And wake up at 10-11am. So I'll wake up at 11am this morning and all of this will be cured. This really is the peak of how much nonsense it seems in my logical mind - Although I have a lot of strength left to deal with it."

175904874,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Symptom remission at 12-weeks strongly predicts long-term recovery from the first episode of psychosis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Psychological medicine , Jul 31 2019 To determine the baseline individual characteristics that predicted symptom recovery and functional recovery at 10-years following the first episode of psychosis.AESOP-10 is a 10-year follow up of an epidemiological, naturalistic population-based cohort of individuals recruited at the time of their first episode of psychosis in two areas in the UK (South East London and Nottingham). Detailed information on demographic, clinical, and social factors was examined to identify which factors predicted symptom and functional remission and recovery over 10-year follow-up. The study included 557 individuals with a first episode psychosis. The main study outcomes were symptom recovery and functional recovery at 10-year follow-
up.At 10 years, 46.2% (n = 140 of 303) of patients achieved symptom recovery and 40.9% (n = 117) achieved functional recovery. The strongest predictor of symptom recovery at 10 years was symptom remission at 12 weeks (adj OR 4.47; CI 2.60-7.67); followed by a diagnosis of depression with psychotic symptoms (adj OR 2.68; CI 1.02-7.05). Symptom remission at 12 weeks was also a strong predictor of functional recovery at 10 years (adj OR 2.75; CI 1.23-6.11), together with being from Nottingham study centre (adj OR 3.23; CI 1.25-8.30) and having a diagnosis of mania (adj OR 8.17; CI 1.61-41.42).Symptom remission at 12 weeks is an important predictor of both symptom and functional recovery at 10 years, with implications for illness management. The concepts of clinical and functional recovery overlap but should be considered separately."

175904928,"The best solution that is freely available is to perform grounding exercises. Scrutinize your childhood and past experiences overall. Maybe visit the places from your past. I suspect you will find very real basis for your supposedly supernatural memories. That is what worked for me. All I say now I mentioned previously on this forum. I have ‚Äúmemories of past lives‚Äù too, your description matches well my own reactions. For example, I ‚Äúremember‚Äù being a tribal priest in coastal or island Greece three thousand years ago. When these delusions appeared I thought that there is no overlap with my real life and these memories. I even managed to match maps, fauna and speculated traditions from real research. +++ I also ‚Äúlost abilities‚Äù from all other ‚Äúpast lives‚Äù that I ‚Äúremember‚Äù: warrior spirit, engineering, and other nonsense. Those are more than likely what I feel I want to do well in this real life, but find myself falling short of my own expectations. Hence the feeling that what is 
differs from what should have been. However, in reality, when I was a child I read a lot of Greek mythos, that produced the setting. I also read a lot on ancient slavic tribal traditions, pre Kiev Rus. That produced the characters. Therefore, your ‚Äúmemories‚Äù appear as a result of your own imagination under stress. I am not trying to be disrespectful, but this really is the only grounding exercise, out of scores, that worked for me personally, and therefore I try to recommend to others."

174330115,"Long story short: My ‚Äúschizophrenia‚Äù seems to be somewhat strange, and unlike what other schizophrenics have described to have experienced, in many respects. It seems to have some intelligence behind it (or a mind of its own), and is systematically, not randomly, messing with me for some unknown purpose. I will call inserted thoughts/concepts ‚Äúfake thoughts‚Äù; to me they are obviously not mine. The feeling that accompanies them is completely alien to me. This condition has made me experience a variety of new feelings. You can read about them here: Has schizophrenia caused you to feel feelings that you've never experienced before? But how can schizophrenics experience new feelings - ones that they‚Äôve never experienced before in their life, ones that have no meaning in the survival and evolutionary sense? How can my condition so readily produce a feeling of ‚Äúfake pleasantness‚Äù when doing certain things like eating, and then the voices/fake thoughts come in saying the fake feeling is mean
t to confuse and damage my subconscious mind and/or my soul. Can schizophrenia invent completely new feelings? My voices claim that the feelings are pre-programmed, and that schizophrenia is a programmed disease: The fake thoughts seem to mostly prefer the 1st theory; maybe because it could be more dangerous. According to this site: https://neurosciencenews.com/vocal-hallucination-brain-schizophrenia-7452/ ‚ÄúResearch using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices.‚Äù The voices have told me things like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre now going to move your hand towards the screen‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to jump up and down and flap your arms like wings‚Äù and then indeed it happens. That seems to indicate that the process controlling the voices is also responsible for controlling my body now. Does that mean the speech area of my brain is also controlling the movement of my body? That would be strange. I‚Äôd say that could be one indication that my s
chizophrenia is different. I‚Äôve read many cases of schizophrenia on the internet. From what they have told or left untold: I seem to be the only one of them who has lost his free will completely, and permanently - my body seems/feels to be out of my control 100% of the time. Even this is being written by the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù now possessing/controlling _PERSON_‚Äôs body, on his behalf and from his perspective. The strange gestures/faces it repeatedly does as a response to different occasions (from what the voices/fake thoughts then are saying it apparently often does it to show its ‚Äúemotions‚Äù: for example when it wants to express dislike about something it makes a facial expression accordingly), and actions that I‚Äôd never do (my own mouth has told me things like ‚ÄúI will kill you‚Äù, and my body has attempted to kill me several times) confirm that there‚Äôs a completely new character in control of my body now. I‚Äôm the only one of them who has lost their own thoughts permanently - my mind is almost const
antly blank, except when there are voices or inserted thoughts/concepts/feelings. I may be the only one of them who has lost their emotions completely - I used to play computer games, watch films and Youtube videos, listen to music, and do sports on my free time, but they offer me //nothing// now, I‚Äôve become numb to everything. Others have reported reduced emotions as a side effect of medications, for me it came without medications. I may to be the only one of them who no longer feels any stress. I may to be the only one of them who no longer feels any anxiety. I used to have lots of stress and anxiety before. I seem to be the only one who experienced the feeling of torture in my body - a very strong, unbearable feeling. It‚Äôs a new feeling, completely different from pain, and worse than pain. There was also some intelligence behind controlling that feeling. When I was in the hospital it was only removed or alleviated during walking, or when doing things that are ‚Äúimportant‚Äù according to the voices (e
ating, sleeping, going to the toilet, talking to the doctor/nurse, or being in the line to get my medications). The process controlling it was intelligent enough to recognize those actions and then react. Why it wanted me to walk all day long every day for months is a mystery to me. I seem to be the only one for whom the condition can completely block me from understanding text or speech. When reading it‚Äôll be the same as if you were staring at a row of foreign letters that make no sense. It does this only if it wants to: normally I can understand everything, but it blocks me from understanding written or spoken prayer every time. Sometimes I get fake thoughts saying it does that because prayer might help me escape from this condition somehow. Then occasionally, when watching a film, I get a fake thought along the lines of saying it is pointless/boring to watch it (while I feel no boredom, never felt it since this condition arrived), and it blocks my understanding of what is being said there. I also have my 
memory wiped clean from ‚Ä¶(unknown time) to summer 2018, except for 2 memories. That unknown time may be somewhere in 2016 or 2017. My condition arrived around Feb 2018 (according to some records; I don‚Äôt remember how and when it started). I‚Äôve had fake thoughts claiming it wiped my memory to hide the reason why I got this ‚Äúcondition‚Äù. I have written notes from that time according to which I still had thoughts then . Does it means my ‚Äúcondition‚Äù blanked my mind permanently on purpose? I don‚Äôt know, and I don‚Äôt know what would be the purpose, maybe it‚Äôs just part of it ridding me from free will and rendering me unable to do anything. My condition can mess with my senses while I eat. It can remove the tastiness from something in the middle of eating it, and it can add fake pleasantness instead. Then the voices would come asking ‚ÄúIs it tasty or is it pleasant?‚Äù, and saying that if I fail to tell the difference it‚Äôs going to affect my consciousness/soul badly. It can mess with my senses w
hile watching something from the TV or Youtube: it can make what I see look like ‚Äòdeath‚Äô, and what I hear sound like ‚Äòdeath‚Äô. Fortunately that doesn‚Äôt happen as much any more. The voices/fake thoughts are messing with me systematically every day. A repeated topic is how I‚Äôm going to be tortured after death. Before they used to say it‚Äôs the absolute truth, now they (normally after a fake thought ‚Äúreminding‚Äù me of it) it is untrue and then that it‚Äôs true, often going back and forth like that many times. According to the fake thougts they do it to affect my supposed belief in it (I can‚Äôt feel it). Another topic the voices are talking about is that I should escape from this condition somehow. Sometimes they say they would like to free me from it, but they can‚Äôt because they are not allowed to. Then they would say they are just pretending to be ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù, and that they are emotionally numb because they‚Äôre just parts of a program. The voices never annoy me or cause any other emotional 
response, yet they keep messing with me. I‚Äôve seen people tell the voices can‚Äôt know anything that you don‚Äôt already know. My voices seem to be quite intelligent at times. One time I hadn‚Äôt been sleeping for days and then the voices told ‚ÄúToday you‚Äôre going to sleep‚Äù and indeed I slept that day. Could be a coincidence. At another time the voices could tell in advance what is going to happen in my dream. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs not a coincidence. My condition is messing with my dreams. The content of my dreams tends to be about my condition, and many times how I‚Äôd try to escape from this condition. Then the fake thoughts will come in telling how it was my fault I haven‚Äôt escaped from this condition. According to the fake thoughts this is part of the plot to torture me after death for eternity, and I myself will be framed ‚Äúguilty‚Äù in it. As already mentioned, one time the voices could tell in advance what is going to happen in my dream. The voices call them ‚Äúfake dreams‚Äù and claim that the 
program that controls the voices produces those dreams. I wake up many times during night, and often when I fall asleep again the dream continues where it left off, or has a similar theme. They tend to be very short towards the end of the night; one night I counted waking up more than 25 times. I‚Äôve had voices in some of the dreams as well. A few times it has made me believe the dream wasn‚Äôt a dream but reality. It took a few moments to realize it was a dream after all. The reason (according to the fake thoughts or voices) all of this is happening is to supposedly program my soul/consciousness or subconscious mind, so that I could be tortured after death. The consciousness is not something tangible, who knows, maybe it does exist in a space that can be programmed by some extraterrestrial species who are advanced/smart enough to be able to tap into it, and program it according to their needs, and affect us from wherever they reside in the universe. The voices/fake thoughts also claim that those species may 
have reprogrammed themselves via genetic engineering, and removed compassion and/or conscience from themselves entirely, because it limits them - without compassion they could torture others in peace. All I know is that my condition has already tortured me (for some unknown purpose) with an unbearable feeling that is completely new to me. Maybe that torture came from a program that is now ‚Äúrunning‚Äù in my consciousness? Maybe it can do it after death as well? I don‚Äôt know. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want it to happen. I don‚Äôt fear it nor do I believe it, maybe simply because I can‚Äôt fear, and I can‚Äôt believe (unless this condition wants me to believe in something). Or maybe the purpose of it is to mess with my fear or/and belief, which may exist still in some level, although I don‚Äôt feel them consciously. The medications I‚Äôve been taking haven‚Äôt had any effects at all apparently. Is your schizophrenia messing with you as well like this? Also, if I‚Äôm wrong somewhere please point out."

175905074,"Im on haldol. What i like and dislike depends on the dose. On a regular dose there isnt much to like, i just sleep my days away and want to die. Only good thing is im too spaced out and sleepy to act on that. On a lower dose i like that it numbs the worst emotional pain/fear and thus i dont go into psychosis. I dislike that it numbs the good things too and therefore makes me feel like an unloving person. Does anyone recognize this: I feel it makes me less empathic. I hate that. Though things like sitting frozen on a public station a whole day in total terror and grief over all the hurt in the world and the way i contributed to that, refusing to buy anything for that reason (food, water‚Ä¶) and being dragged to a police cell might not be the right way to experience empathy either‚Ä¶"

175905081,I‚Äôm finding that I don‚Äôt have to believe that reaction. Pain is usually my reason for thinking I can‚Äôt but then I go ahead and do the job with no pain to speak of. I think the pain was either in the past or sympathy pains for someone else. I got a job done today - it was digging around through my things to find my stamp collection which I plan to give to my grand nephew. He is about the same age as I was when I was interested in collecting stamps and it was quite a hobby.

175905083,"I was made to sleep on the floor in the room next door by my boyfriend for 3 years - it was on and off but frequent - and when i was alone in that room all i wanted was to be with him‚Ä¶ i was crazy psychotic for a big part of that relationship when i went to hospital i would only sleep on a _NAME_ on the floor by the bed most of the time he split up with me twice - both times i was in hospital Now married I don‚Äôt know if this still bugs me feel like i‚Äôm afraid to go to bed afraid of intimacy my husband has had to put up with me leaving the bed in the middle of the night to sleep on the floor downstairs. I now still get up 10 years later and stay awake from 5 - 7 is usual and then i might sleep a bit longer or sometimes i just don‚Äôt go back to bed i don‚Äôt know how he feels but it must be rubbish not to know at any time in the night if he checks for me and i‚Äôm not there mostly now i watch tv on my laptop at night this is probably the only thing i really have to change my meds make me drows
y and i take them at the same time each day but the will to return to bed isn‚Äôt there while my previous boyfriend relationship was very sexual and quite abusive now my meds do not let me get horny and my husband is fairly asexual himself all i want to do is sleep beside him but that is overruled by me not wanting to disturb his sleep or that i just don‚Äôt want to go back to bed i feel it is like self harm not sleeping - not enjoying the day - getting more and more obese when i go to bed hungry for the last 10 years i have had to get up and eat something because my pedophile father - when he had some excess weight for the first time had an easy time of dieting (it‚Äôs proven men do) and said he ‚Äòenjoyed his hunger‚Äô That is the thing i used to do go to bed hungry loving that i was losing weight and feeling proud to keep to a normal weight i can‚Äôt do it now - lack of sleep is a major contributor to a binge eating disorder, i get 5 - 7 hours usually I just got rid of my smartphone to stop my addiction of 
having it in my face maybe hide the laptop would be a solution or talking more about it"

I don‚Äôt want to discourage you from trying something new, but the reality is that very few schizophrenics can handle school. And with a college degree your life will get increasingly more difficult with a high paying job. I would recommend trying for an associates degree in a community college first. You may want to consiee de r some part time work too. Community college can be as demanding as the courses you take. I had mostly business coursework in community college.

It‚Äôs only when I pause my thinking or slow it down, for example to ask my subconscious questions, that they pop up."

175905125,I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding you _AT_MENTION_ . The title of your thread doesn‚Äôt seem to have much to do with your statements within the thread which are kind of nonsensical. Are you on your meds?

My therapist said that long term, meds aren‚Äôt an effective solution for anxiety. But having them for the beginning really helped with getting things under control enough to start working on the root causes in therapy. It‚Äôs mostly a lot of reality testing and exposure therapy."

Anyway, the 50mg increase in quetiapine has not made any difference; my sleep is the same and I still feel the unpleasant feelings during night / early morning. I also feel them during daytime, except when doing certain things, but I forgot to mention it to the doctor. I‚Äôve never felt the sedative property of it either.

When you first met her, was she already like this? You said her sister did not have this condition? Is she more sensitive than her sister? azcentral.com says Medicines: Traditional treatment cures for anxiety disorders lean towards medications such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and beta-blockers. These medications work to sedate the amydala and limbic system by altering neurotransmitter levels in the brain, resulting in a calming, relaxing effect. And while these medications are effective in terms of relieving symptoms, the root of anxiety remains intact. As a result, these medicationsbenzodiazepines in particularcan become highly addictive, requiring higher and higher doses to treat the same symptoms. Psychotherapy: The _USER_ID_ plays a central role in maintaining feelings of anxiety. As such, treating the root of this condit
ion requires the brain, and/or the _USER_ID_, to be retrained in how it responds to perceived threats. Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy is a treatment approach that addresses the thought processes which trigger a person's emotional responses. Instead of perceiving a situation as threatening, individuals learn to use logical thinking processes to change how they perceive a situation. As long as what's perceived appears non-threatening, the _USER_ID_ has no reason to react."

174330166,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Subclinical paranoid beliefs and enhanced neural response during processing of unattractive faces. _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, NeuroImage. Clinical, Apr 25 2020 The perception of faces and consequent social inferences are fundamental for interpersonal communication. While facial expression is important for interindividual communication, constitutional and acquired features are crucial for basic emotions of attraction or repulsion. An emotional bias in face processing has been shown in schizophrenia, but the neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. Studies on the interaction between face processing and the emotional state of healthy individuals may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of the paranoid syndrome in psychosis. This study addressed facial attractiveness and paranoid ideas in a non-clinical population. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated neural activation patterns of 99 healt
hy subjects during the passive perception of a dynamic presentation of faces with different attractiveness. We found that the perceived attractiveness of faces was linked to the activity of face processing and limbic regions including the fusiform gyrus, _USER_ID_, and prefrontal areas. Paranoid beliefs interacted with perceived attractiveness in these regions resulting in a higher response range and increased activation after the presentation of unattractive faces. However, no behavioral interactions between reported subjective attractiveness and paranoid beliefs were found. The results showed that increased activation of limbic brain regions is linked to paranoid beliefs. Since similar correlations were found in clinical populations with paranoid syndromes, we suggest a dimension of emotional dysregulation ranging from subclinical paranoid beliefs to paranoid schizophrenia."

175905312,It‚Äôs a bit like talking to someone on drugs. It makes sense to them and not others‚Ä¶ I suspect you have some psychosis and hospital is a good place to be. Honestly. Cars aren‚Äôt that advanced. If they were I could sleep on my way into my volunteer job. As it is I have to go the hard yards and drive the bloody hunk of metal myself!
175905313,I did not even have a formal interview at my job. He basically asked me a few questions about my situation and then hired me.

175905314,I hope you can get well soon.

Then I started hearing the same voices in my workplace where I work alone overnight. Then eventually the subway trains, and other places. I finally saw a doctor and realized this wasn‚Äôt real. They prescribed risperadol (spelling?) and the sound got really low. The only thing is the side affects was awful, so I ended switching to something else.

When I talk about it he doesn't answer, and/or takes something away, like the two extra days he was planning to be here. I should practise socializing so maybe I'll try to strike up a conversation with the cute guy. It would be a little weird, but that's ok I think. I hate the way RLS attacks every muscle and joint.

I‚Äôll check and have found this online: ‚ÄòIn summary, the data available so far indicate that the optimum dose for aripiprazole is 10 mg/day and that doses above 20 mg/day provide no additional benefit.‚Äô ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Aripiprazole: dose-response relationship in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. S _PERSON_ and _NAME_, CNS drugs , Sep 2009 Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that has been shown to be more effective than placebo and at least as effective as haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Despite having a well defined licensed dose range, the optimum dose for aripiprazole is yet to be established. Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D(2) receptors, with near maximal receptor occupancy at a dose of 30 mg. Even doses as low as 2 mg, thought not to be clinically effective, have produced striatal D(2) receptor occupancies exceeding 70%, higher than the accepted threshold for anti
psychotic effect. In this review we examined the efficacy data from short-term studies of aripiprazole in relapsed schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, in order to establish a dose-response relationship for aripiprazole. Results of five fixed-dose studies suggest that the threshold for clinical effect is between 5 and 10 mg/day. In addition, the highest response rate is seen at 10 mg/day. Doses above 20 mg/day do not appear to provide any additional benefit and may be associated with a smaller change in symptom scores. In summary, the data available so far indicate that the optimum dose for aripiprazole is 10 mg/day and that doses above 20 mg/day provide no additional benefit."

175905415,Honestly maybe it‚Äôs best to let your psychiatrist know but without spilling all the beans lol. Tell them but not with words. Just make it known to them you want to alter your meds without telling them everything cause sometimes they feel obliged professionally to hospitalize even if deep down they know you‚Äôre doing relatively well. Just be smart about it and prudent in what you say and you can get help without being hospitalized

175905425,"Hello _PERSON_, Thank you so much for reaching out to me. It felt good to see your message. I have had one heck of a day today trying to hold back my tears as I was having an anxiety moment most of the day. I have to learn how to stop letting things bother me like they do, concerning my health issues. I should also stop researching online and scaring myself. I know darn well I can't change anything about any of it. But it is so hard. I keep looking for anything that can help me better cope with my gastroparesis, and I end up finding nothing that can help. I end up finding sad and scary stories and I never know if they are true or not. So my anxiety hits the roof and I end up crying. This is no way to live, but it is my life. I am looking forward to when it gets warmer outside, so I am not stuck inside. I may not be able to walk like I used to, but I am looking forward to sitting out in a park. Being in nature has a way of lifting one's mood. I certainly need mood lifting. I hope you are doing well. 
Thank you again for reaching out to me. It made my day."

One other point of interest is that 80% of the workforce in my company seem to have made complaints of symptoms. Either the government wanted this to happen so to build a baseline immunity or people are playing it up to get out of working. Either is plausible and I guess they aren't exclusive options. Still, interesting to see how our employers have bent over backwards to accommodate these workers."

175905454,Hi my name is _NAME_. And I am 35 and recently moved to another state to be with my fiance who actually left me in the other state and moved out here first. Then claimed to be miserable without me and cried and what not so I decided to move out here. But since I moved out here it's like he doesn't appreciate me and the things I do and he lied to me saying I wouldn't be paying for anything and I pay all the bills now and barely have anything left for myself. It's like my depression is getting worse. He's always yelling at me and he actually apologized for being a jerk yesterday but then he continues today. Unless we are around others. Then it's different. He's smacking my ass and leaning on me and everything. The Dr I talked to said I need to look up domestic violence support groups. But I really don't want to leave him and t9 through everything again. I just want him to change.

174330203,"Welcome back. It sounds like you got some good insights and identified the problems. And you‚Äôre taking some good steps to solve them. Good job. Without going on a rant here, AA, CA or NA are a great way to get back on track with your life. Those programs not only treat the problem of addiction but they also show you a new way to live. They can help guide you to an honest, principled, useful life. Following some of their simple principles and taking suggestions from other people who had more experience than me changed my life drastically for the better. I am personally not as gung ho about being so involved in the program. I haven‚Äôt been to a meeting in awhile but some stuff stuck with me and maybe my experience can help anothet struggling addict. My life in my crack addiction revolved around getting and using drugs. The addiction took me to the worst places with the worst people. And I had to sneak around hiding my addiction from my family and employer and all the people who were trying to help 
me. Personally, as an addict I never had a ‚Äútypical‚Äù day when I used. Every day was a new misery and more problems and new, fuc*_NAME_ up situations. Anyways, When I got clean after four years of smoking, my life blossomed. I became employable again, I enrolled in college, I made a couple new friends, I was going to AA, CA and NA five or six days a week. People in meetings started recognizing me and getting used to me and I made few AA friendsand many aquaintences. I started socializing more and did a ton of fun stuff with my family and friends. I credit it all to the program. I took my recovery dead serious but I was having fun. I became a more honest, responsible person thanks to the program. Sorry about talking so much about AA, addiction is only one slice of your life, you have many other hurdles in life to get past. But when people in meetings moaned and groaned about their life and all their responsibilities and problems and complained that NA or CA took up too much of their precious time and they h
ad other important things to do instead of meetings someone in a meeting would usually point out that without your sobriety and AA and being clean you would not have any of that stuff anyways. So that‚Äôs why meetings are a priority. Anyways, congratulations on your 40 days, that‚Äôs huge. Just be careful, try to stay away from people and places with drugs. You don‚Äôt need the temptation. You‚Äôve been through the wringer with drugs and schizophrenia, just take it easy now and maybe your head is out of that drug induced fog and you can make some good, smart desicions now and help yourself live a decent life. Good luck, take care and hopefully things will work out."

I have quit multiple things that are bad for me from self harm to cigarettes, and food helped me quit those things, I would just eat my cravings away and I fully embraced the hunger from my AP and I kind of used it as an excuse to not police what I eat. It gave me a reason to give into my hunger. I was 351 pounds and I‚Äôm down about 6 pounds now, but its still hard. The problem with food is that I can‚Äôt just not have it. I can live without cigarettes and other bad habits, but I literally cannot live without food. I will have to mend my relationship with food so I don‚Äôt seek that euphoric feeling when I eat.

I‚Äôve also started enjoying my psychotherapy appointments again. However, I don‚Äôt enjoy listening to music again yet. So some part of anhedonia got better, while another remains. I REALLY want to be able to enjoy music again. So that‚Äôs kinda frustrating. But I can‚Äôt complain, because of the progress I‚Äôve been having regarding the other side effects I had. And also, there are still half-lifes that need to pass. I‚Äôm hoping that another 4 months can take care of that"

He‚Äôs very sadistic and very focused on making me suffer he gets enjoyment from tormenting me. Saying this, when he was at its worst on a plane ride home (he tried to get me to open the emergency exits,in flight and wanted me to make the plane crash) I actually laughed at him and compared him to _NAME_. I lold at the time which took enormous strength. _NAME_, he‚Äôs an _NAME_ operative who I attributed to my old neighbor who I thought was watching me through cameras. He was very sadistic but rational and intelligent. He‚Äôs second in command, but at the same rank of _NAME_.His one focus was to punish me for the insult I said to _NAME_ (leader of the _NAME_ in my town) and to make me insane.

But he has a dark side, in the early stages he was very sadistic as well telling me to kill and got enjoyment out of my suffering (when the voices got loud) he‚Äôs the one I hear when I get whispers and faint voices nowadays. _NAME_, is the boss of ownie. He‚Äôs the head of the PIRA in my town. _PERSON_ answers to _NAME_ but not _NAME_ or _NAME_. He came because I was intimidating ownie by reading his mind (or hearing his thoughts) and _NAME_ was meant there to prove that I couldn‚Äôt read minds and to reassure ownie. He was a very old fashioned, kind of reassuring voice which Sounded like he was the boss of the PIRA. Always ensured me it was never too late to start a new life away from all the voices. He actually made a deal with _NAME_ to make him stop sending voices for two days a week. But he also had a dark side, non shelontly telling me to kill myself after I tri
ed but failed to rationalize my way out of hearing voices._NAME_ told me to do this as an experiment by Telling myself it wasn‚Äôt possible to hear voices. It actually dulled them a bit."

Especially in WoW, those guilds can require you to do voice chat and be online x amount of days and hours a week, and do x amount of raids. I don‚Äôt like that. I want to play when I want to play, no more, no less. Also, it depends on how well you manage it. When I played, if someone called me and asked if I wanted to hang out, I said ‚Äúyeah sure‚Äù and closed the game. I did my homework and chores before playing. When my little brother, _NAME_, discovered WoW, his grades suffered so badly my stepmom had to take away his internet priviledges until he got them back up.

He said that my schizophrenia is bad but he's seen people that are far more worse mentally. He says I have a chance at being successful from mental illness and to find ways to do x, y, z if I can't do certain things - Just to get myself out of it. He's going to talk with my mom alone about what to do to - Non-med wise in terms of therapy and focusing on the good things that i can do to prevent more hospitalizations.

Apparently over the course of 8 1/2 years at my job, I have read clues wrong numerous times, according to certain people here and made grave errors, and allegedly thought many, many women wanted to have sex with the 50+ year old, overweight janitor. Apparently, according to people , I‚Äôm a serial harasser who has never had one complaint lodged against him by the Army or my company, though I‚Äôve been working in close quarters with dozens and dozens of women, some who I‚Äôve known the whole time I‚Äôve been there and 5 out of my last 7 direct supervisors were young women in their late twenties-to-early thirties and I got along fine with them, for the most part and there was never even a hint any interaction with them was EVER remotely close to sexual harassment. Also apparently, some people here have ‚ÄúLOTS‚Äù of evidence I‚Äôve behaved drastically inappropriate to many of the soldier women. And yes, I have schizophrenia and I‚Äôm not g
reat socially and have read clues wrong many times. I‚Äôm not using schizophrenia as an excuse but to label me ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù, a ‚Äúmultiple harasser‚Äù 'behaving problematically"" ‚Ä¶and having ‚Äúworrisome interpersonal‚Äù relationships at work. It‚Äôs funny, I‚Äôve been there the 8 years and believe me, the Army reserve is a stickler for enforcing rules and regulations and us janitors have to follow most of the same rules as the soldiers when it has to do with behavior. I got chewed out and almost disciplined by my company about two months ago for standing in the gym waiting for a co-worker to finish his task so we could tackle cleaning the last restroom of the day. I was in there 5 minutes and a soldier who I didn‚Äôt see complained because they thought I was using the equipment which is against the rules. But that‚Äôs how the army is. Believe me, nothing gets by them, you never know when your being watched but 90% of the time I‚Äôm doing nothing wrong so it doesn‚Äôt matter. Maybe a few of these certain pe
ople here had some valid points: maybe several valid points. But believe me, no ones going to scare me or intimidate me by implying I am going to lose my job.

I realized that I may have been delusional and paranoid for a lot longer than I ever could‚Äôve realized before clozapine. I believed my dad‚Äôs delusions long after I moved away from my family‚Äôs place. My brother and sister were never in that situation and they got in line with reality after moving out. I have had highly erratic moving patterns over the years and moved like 5-6 times in the span of 8 years. I was in a cycle I did not know how to get out of. When I was at university in 2009-2010 I thought I was a super important person and was smarter and more insightful than anyone else. I had good grades but I was a loner despite hanging out with campus organization stuff. My grades began to degrade over the next 4 years until I had some flunked courses, then lost my job, and then broke in 2015. Then my first psychosis in 2016, followed by many. I heard voices in the f
orm of whispers when I was young and a teen, and in my pre-teen/teen years I heard people calling my name a lot..and when I checked no one called my name. It was disorientating. My sense of reality I realize was never...stable. I went through so many different beliefs, ideas, expressions, you name it...and I have not had any sense of homeostasis with the world around me. Maybe...just maybe, I was out of touch with reality without fully realizing it. Thoughts?"

175905776,"Thanks for showing interest in me as a person. Summary, related to your question: - In a lot of situations (social or economic) LESS anxious. Which gets me into trouble. I don't feel the need to play roles for being socially accepted, so people think I'm ""odd"". I dare to have my own opinion and psychological adaptions to groups like ""group thinking"" affect me less. - But in other situations MORE anxious. Which gets me into trouble as well E.g. I'm very sensitive, have a lot of 'emotional' empathy (despite less 'cognitive' empathy), and being auhoritarian or telling people ""no"" is difficult for me when this'd hurt their feelings. Also competing with less sensitive people (machiawellis, ASDs) is difficult for me. I tend to knuckle down then, and my hypothesis is that this is based on social fear. Sensitivity: When I see movies tears are running very easy over my face. Even with some cartoons. Everyone's laughing about this But I can sleep everywhere, even in a chair when it's loud around me. Bu
t generally I'm probably more sensitive. Also I can feel better what's going on in my children than normal fathers. Tightly wound: I'm not sure. Sometimes my problem is more that I fight back too early and with too much punch. My sense of fairness reacts earlier than usual. So I'm less unfair myself, but over-react quickly when others do things I'd never do. People sense some kind of weakness in my body language, my way of talking ... I'm not an alpha wolf, and some sense this as weakness and attack me (with success sometimes - taking over my management responsibilities). Why are you asking ? Maybe that's not the best foundation for a manager, right ?"

175905783,"Hello trudging buddies. To update, I had a serious bout of insomnia after switching from zyprexa to geodon. Went back to the behavioral center (inpatient) to be reacquainted with zyprexa. Things are back to normal. Sleep lots, eat lots, semi-zombie mode. And back at my job-yay! During the try with geodon, I didn‚Äôt sleep. I lost weight, I was rarely hungry. I went to the gym more. Zombie mode significantly reduced, I had some swagger (attitude) about me. I‚Äôm thinking of trying seroquel. Am I wasting my time? Should I just accept that meds are imperfect? Should I keep searching for the right med cocktail? Bear in mind I was on zyprexa for 15 years continuous. Confused but curious."
175905784,"I didnt get withdrawals unless when I stopped my Risperdal on my own abruptly in one night and took a full Latuda dose the same night. I had extreme headaches, brain zaps and tremors, psychotic symptoms and felt really bad. I was lucky as I was nearing full psychosis and decided to take 5mg Risperdal on my own instead of the prescribed 3mg which wasnt working anymore, 4mg didnt work either. Now I am stable on 4mg. Maybe if I didnt mess with meds I would still be on 3mg."
175905785,I have nightmares on all antipsychotics if that makes you feel better. You have daily nightmares? I have them once every 3 weeks but I got used to them.

175905788,"well, do you hear nothing when the voices are talking only or whenever you try to think inner thoughts? In Zen, a state of no-mind(no thoughts) is seen as height of meditation success and a good way to deal with adversity."
175905789,wow thanks chordy !! thanks _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ still making small sales‚Ä¶but thank you so much for buying my book !!
175905790,You can‚Äôt put everything down to being in my head. I‚Äôm a rational person that‚Äôs why I struggle with these things like the guy giving me a gesture. I know the guy and it was definently him
175905791,i was born late 80s and I am currently 31. got sick at 22.
175905792,When I stopped my meds my psychiatrist threatened to force me to take them.
175905793,Right putting it on now brother
175905794,I find the side effects actually get better with time not worse. I don‚Äôt love being on meds but I‚Äôll never stop taking them.
175905795,_AT_MENTION_-Cotton you are very lucky to diagnosis early.don t forget this.i wish they could diagnosis and force to me medicines 20 years ago.i wouldn t ruin my health career and teeth then plus without tonnes of humiliation stupid decision etc.believe me you are in the right and hard way.keep fighting it.if i get these medicine 20 years ago i would be in a really good position.believe me without medicine you will be never good position than medicated position.things getting messed up and messep everyday.medicines just give you a choice for normal life.i won t had this choice 20 years ago.believe me.
175905796,"Oh, I didn‚Äôt know"
175905797,"Yeah. Once you test positive, it‚Äôs always living inside you, and you have to be very careful with open wounds because it could get back in your bloodstream. This time it was an ingrown hair in my armpit. Seems harmless, but I only noticed it yesterday and by today it was so bad that I could barely move my arm."
175905798,"I am going to blur all this because it may be triggering. It was like ventriloquism. Ventriloquists play two roles. Most obviously they give life to a puppet, but less obviously, even as they manipulate the puppet, they also pretend to be a person who believes in the separate existence of the puppet persona. I felt that the ‚ÄúI‚Äù of my self narrative was the puppet, and that a giant was pretending to be a woman, who was ventriloquizing myself talking to a transvestite puppeteer, in a plaintiff yet sexual way. The puppet was hitting on the puppeteer. Due to the nature of the roles, the sheer terrifying size of the puppeteer and behind that the giant reality, the loss of self, the loss of all dreams (particularly romantic love), and some sort of time distortion or time dissolution (I felt I could see the future, or that time did not exist), the feeling was of disgust and fear. I wrote, in a shaky hand ‚ÄúI am in Hell.‚Äù So in a sense I did feel I was talking to a devil. For a while after that I fe
lt that I was the spore of the devil, going as far as to ask my parents whether my father was really my father. I felt that I could read the thoughts of others, a general sense of lack of reality, paranoia, and also self-aggrandizement. I also felt that I would be going there again, and that by then I would have made my choices. In answer to your second question, personally, and following _PERSON_, who happened to live in the same town as where I now live, I don‚Äôt think it is wrong. But the demonic springs from the self-disgust at the nature of the simulation, that unfortunately I feel I am still living. I am in my fifties. I need to make the right ‚Äúchoices‚Äù faster. I would skip _PERSON_. I read him first but I think the others are more readable and he adds little to the mix. He does say that hearing oneself speak is a form of masturbation, which for me is central. Yes.My self speech is a sort of masturbation, I feel. _PERSON_ was raised in Algeria, an Islam country and the Fall of man in Islam involves 
a sexualised whispering, which is what thought is - our voice made quieter."

175905803,"When I was in college I‚Äôd often shop at _NAME_. As for brands, I really liked wearing Dockers. I also have a pair of _NAME_‚Äôs that have not fit me for several years. I‚Äôd wear those. Dockers felt comfortable. I looked nerdy before it was hip. A short sleeved button up shirt tucked while wearing Dockers, a belt and glasses. I was a bonafide nerd. Then it became a trend some basketball players dressed similar to. I‚Äôd wear my _NAME_‚Äôs with a Ramones t-shirt and that sort of clothes. I looked more like a rocker that way. Now that I‚Äôm obese, I wear whatever I can find that fits comfortably."
174330274,I meant abilify?
175905804,Nice work!! Sometimes I wish I can do that
175905805,I‚Äôm actually hard of hearing but I can‚Äôt afford hearing aids. I miss what people say all the time.
175905806,Get to go back to working 5 days per week next week. I'm glad of that because I do better with routine. Plus it is boring at home right now with COVID restrictions.
175905807,Are you sure you are taking your meds and that they are working?
175905808,Glad you added your perspective SP! You always seem so wise to me!
175905809,"Do as I say, not as I do, guys!"
174330280,"No, I don‚Äôt mean daily. I mean in months or year. Do they ever cease?"
175905810,Maybe. You won‚Äôt know unless you try to change things around. It‚Äôs scary but we are here to help you through it.
175905811,The most ? Five.
175905812,"I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one with time distortion. I have time dilation. It seems like I‚Äôve had an endless life. It makes you crazy! I‚Äôm fifty years old, I feel one hundred and fifty. I think I‚Äôll have a gentle transition into death when it finally comes. I too will go to sleep early, maybe seven or eight in the evening and wake at twelve and think it‚Äôs dawn. Maybe I‚Äôm a saint. They are called ‚Äúelders‚Äù , Lol."
175905813,Like I will say something I don‚Äôt mean when I‚Äôm psychotic like 8 years ago. I will have flashbacks to what I said. And that phrase will kinda manifest in my head. Especially all the years on the Internet seeing myself type out phrases. It‚Äôs not always a bad thing and it could be 100% positive but I will still regret saying it in the first place. Even if it‚Äôs beneficial to me.
175905814,"Currently vaping my cucumber/watermelon 3mg Nicotine juice. 40 watt. Also using a 2.4watt pen for my CBD/THC cartridges. I‚Äôm comfortable where I‚Äôm at with my usage.

175905815,"But yeah, ive felt bad about it."

175905817,Good luck in the interview as they say just be yourself
175905818,Oh‚Ä¶ i didnt know aps do those things. Is that a good thing?
175905819,I had to fill in on the form if i have a mental illness lol. Wtf do they need to know ?
175905820,"It‚Äôs considered rude to call gays ‚Äúhomos‚Äù. The terms are gay, lesbian, lgbt. _PERSON_ may be other terms but homo is insulting."
175905821,Does anyone know the details of how to distinguish delusions from over valued ideas and obsessions with poor insight? I cant find much info on this and it is important to my symptoms as when have an episode I am unable to tell my paranoia from reality but am not convinced it is true.
175905822,The uke strings are soft though by comparison....
175905823,"Social worker is the way to go. I‚Äôm going for social work, my goal is to be a case worker in mental health. Maybe one day do therapy. It‚Äôs less schooling than being a psychologist, and in my state an MSW is more valuable and diverse than a masters in psychology, which would let you be a limited licensed counselor. Burnout is a problem though. I love kids, but I could never work for CPS, because the emotional toll it takes is surreal from what I‚Äôve heard. Burnout is avoidable if you have healthy outlets, such as therapy, exercise, a hobby, and other things to relieve stress."

175905831,I liked _NAME_. He kept it simple.
175905832,You need to tell your husband. You could wait until your therapist can see you and bring him into the session with you so there‚Äôs a third party to help smooth things out.
175905833,They can excite the brain which can affect you by triggering psychosis or mania. It depends on the preworkout though
175905834,Cricket is my sport as most of you know. I still play competitively at soon to be 49. Love the sport!
175905835,i like green like the plants and blue like a blue sky on a summer day‚Ä¶
175905836,"Yup super paranoid. And confusion scatter brained unable to think properly visual illusions and much more. The group of people watch, monitor me, and want to do bad things to me and even my family. They hate me. I don‚Äôt completely know why but I do have a couple of reasons that I don‚Äôt want to share. I feel I‚Äôve already given you too much information"
175905837,"In a way my anxiety is much like psychosis....someone else needs to provide a reality check in a way. But one thing also handy is ACT and you can learn that without a T. One aspect of ACT is guided meditation. For example if you‚Äôre having distressing thoughts you can think of a tree overhanging a stream. Picture a leaf dropping in the stream and floating downstream....everytime you have a thought...positive, negative or otherwise attach it to a leaf and watch it drift away. You don‚Äôt judge the thoughts just watch them drift away."
175905838,Is this part of paranoia worrying about it?
175905839,"ECT eases depression if depression is caused from bad thoughts, emotions etc. For example if you have suicidal thought, hopeless thoughts etc etc and these thoughts preventing you from doing day to day activities etc. On the other hand if you have lack of emotions, thoughts etc then ECT will be a disaster. Either way its only done for severe cases and not recommended due to its lasting memory effects. If your depression is due to negative thoughts as in the first case then you can try myo inositol. It can affect your short term memory as it makes you very difficult to hold on to negative intrusive thoughts and thus eases your depression and is far better than ECT and also do not require any prescription either as its sold as a dietary supplement."
175905840,They need me out here too badly I guess
175905841,"It could be that he is normal, there are plenty of normal people with strange beliefs."

175905842,"Sorry, _PERSON_. _PERSON_!!!!!"
175905843,"I understand the temptation‚Ä¶ I go through it quite often. I always think of the time I smoked cannabis after work to wind down, just something to look forward to. But then again I also smoked when I woke up, before work, sometimes during work before doing anything as matter of fact while walking my dog, doing laundry like EVERYTHING, quite literally. It‚Äôs like a second cigarette‚Ä¶ as matter of fact I really don‚Äôt know how to feel emotions without it really It really is an expensive habit though‚Ä¶and I‚Äôve had trouble with the law before and acted like a junkie when I was dry‚Ä¶ roaming the street and asking strangers to score some, I‚Äôve stole things to buy some cannabis and ended few relationship over it also‚Ä¶ I guess that‚Äôs the definition of addiction though. I haven‚Äôt smoked since last September‚Ä¶ sometimes I would love to take a hit. Heck I‚Äôm even considering moving to a legal state because of it‚Ä¶but if I smoke im pretty sure I‚Äôll feel hella paranoid though, and the risk 
of having psychosis will always be there‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not able to give you helping words, but I guess I just want to tell you that I‚Äôm going through similar type of things"
175905844,I have a suspicion that your ‚Äúnegative‚Äù symptoms are caused by your moderate dose risperidone. Might want to try looking at the Lancet study and choose a medicine with less sedation or reduce your dosage slightly and see how you feel like 0.5 mg risperidone
175905845,Did u tell anyone? Who wAs the rapist?
175905846,"I am sure it will pass eventually, as I do a physical job, and the exhaustion will catch up with me eventually. Right now it seems like a difficult thing to deal with, but I am trying not to get too stressed about it, as that will just make things worse. All I do in the early hours is drink coffee and smoke. Really need to stop it, but I am bored, and these things bring me some comfort."
175905847,"Bodybuilders kind of gross me out a bit tbh because I have a trigger for exposed veins. Not their fault, but I do have trouble looking at their arms,"
174330278,I don‚Äôt think there are many trilionaires. That‚Äôs a lot of money. _NAME_ is a billionaire but he couldn‚Äôt even put a dent in what the US owes in national debt. Virtual currency is out there. Like Bitcoin and the like. The IRS is trying to figure out how to _NAME_ it. It can buy things and supposedly can‚Äôt be hacked. If you lose your password there is no way to recover your investment and no nation or debt collectors can touch it. It‚Äôs better than a Swiss bank account.
175905848,"That is so true _NAME_, Mental health problems are a disability. Though a lot of us can function on the proper medication. But I tried to get disability and they said I could work in a ticket booth. Which there aren't any around here. I had fibromyalgia and depression. I guess I am one of the ones that slipped though the cracks. Though I am still managing to make it. On getting back on topic of this thread... (sorry, I got us side tracked) I think getting disability is a successful treatment as long as medications needed are obtained. As long as people can stay somewhat active in their lives. Mentally and physically. I think that the disability monies help them to live a somewhat normal life. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175905849,I wish I didn‚Äôt stop meds as I needed higher doses to be stable after relapsing. Zyprexa didn‚Äôt work at all too after I relapsed.
175905850,"It does work for me, i wasnt talking about psychotic symptoms in this thread"
175905851,It‚Äôs dangerous 1515151
175905852,I‚Äôm not expecting anyone here to agree with it. But I cant go a day lately without thinking j dont have sza. I‚Äôve been on psyche meds longer than I‚Äôve shown any symptoms so paet of me thinks the mediciation brought it on. That I dont have it. I dont have it. Been two days and I feel pretty good. Cant complain.
175905853,"It took one hospitalization, meds, and about a month to realize that the songs are just songs. Just cause it may relate to me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs about me. And to answer you question. I thought every song on Spotify was about me. Didn‚Äôt matter what era the song was from."
174330287,"Clozapine is a great medication, i take it myself. However, it can have some nasty side effects, but you are monitored very closely if you choose to take Clozapine. For a small minority, it will cause some very rare but potentially life threatening effects."
175905854,Yes I get a spirit that pops up sometimes. They feel real. Do you get something like that? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs something you can call a symptom
175905855,"I say no, just based on my own experiences. I personally can live a good life with just whispers, when I‚Äôve got them. They don‚Äôt confuse me or have power over me. Just background noise. I‚Äôd say save it Incase they come back real bad, and if you start thinking the _NAME_ is after you again. But that‚Äôs just my take on it. Only whispers are a good day for me. But I can fully understand why you would want to get rid of them. I don‚Äôt have the right answer, just my opinion. Either way though, you‚Äôre a good man who doesn‚Äôt deserve to suffer. And I‚Äôm wishing you well."
175905856,I slept outside a train station. All I had was my coat and it was really cold. When the train station opened at like 3 in the morning I would go inside and sleep in a chair
175905857,I finally Showered today. and dried and straightened my hair. yay for me . tams yay for all of us
175905858,If I dont start painting soon I‚Äôm gonna cut my ear off. I think that‚Äôs a caffeine reference but I need to check hahaha
175905859,"‚ÄúWell, it was either the red one, the green one or this one and this one brings out my eyes.‚Äù"
174330285,Hi _NAME_ I could tell by how committed you are to the subject. I‚Äôm glad your giving out information to the people being affected by it and that your information opened my eyes. On the other hand it could be someone thinking it‚Äôs happening and it might be paranoia stemming from schizophrenia. How do u tell people with schizophrenia how to recognize the difference? It‚Äôs just hard to prove..unless your a hacker.
175905860,Sounds harmless to me.
175905861,Thank you for saying that both of you!
175905862,I also Notice my mania gets worse when I smoke. And I smoke when my routine gets f-d up. Working on getting back on track r n. I think I have things figured out. I‚Äôm just going to need to get in my bike 2-3 times a day. You‚Äôll improve when you you start working out again _AT_MENTION_. U Don‚Äôt need to wait until January to start. Your chances of success are better if you start r n.
175905863,"Here‚Äôs a leading academics who researches narcissism interview, and at what point this becomes a disorder."
175905864,Everyone has. Someone has said you dont make sense or pointed to their head while looking at you or said what are you doing or said are you crazy?
175905865,"How do you know you‚Äôre not just making it up and getting it from _NAME_, no offense? I don‚Äôt know. So you think you‚Äôre an alien? A lot of what you say doesn‚Äôt make sense, but I appreciate your open-ness. I know meds don‚Äôt really work for me. It‚Äôs more about happiness and quality of life instead. Like laughing, smiling, and crying, and having fun‚Ä¶ I know you take meds. I personally had delusions I was a part Anunnaki (a different type of reptilian) and of non-royalty. More like an anomoly. Basically, I cannot shape shift at all and don‚Äôt want to. I have a conscience, empathy, sympathy, morality, compassion, love, etc. There‚Äôs good and bad. I think being a Christian has helped me in a way but it‚Äôs also a fear factor controlling system. From what I read a lot of people hate the Anunnaki and don‚Äôt know much about them. Hence, my past life trauma and suffering. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve seen reptilians in DUMBS in my past lives and somehow reincarnated back in time in my time l
oop above ground on planet earth. I believe the elite got Alien technology out there for them to use and abuse and while us peons get sick. Oh well. I can‚Äôt really recommend anything for you but you know I accept what you say with open mind and not going to judge like some people here. I‚Äôm on the same page as you. The problem we both has is our minds get contaminated with outside information from others. I might have had years ahead of you so my story is a little longer and ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô but I still feel ya. I won‚Äôt go and say I totally believe what your saying just like you might not believe what I‚Äôm saying, but know I won‚Äôt judge you or anyone else here for the most part. I‚Äôm pretty open. I think you‚Äôre on the right forum for sure. Same with me. I hope you feel better. Just know every thought you have isn‚Äôt real. Same thing with dreams and other things. I had some strange things I thought were real and then I recognized it as false. Good luck!"
175905866,I had voices full blown psychotic
175905867,"Sounds like they‚Äôve got a bit of paranoia going on. I find that to be a bit prejudiced, it automatically assumes you‚Äôre dangerous. It‚Äôs hurtful to hear something like that."
175905868,Hope he feels better soon SP
175905869,My birthday is in October as well!
175905870,I‚Äôve only tried a few times when I was in school. It never ended up looking good! I‚Äôd like to try again but its always a lot harder than it looks (for me).

175905874,I‚Äôve been tired of life for years and I‚Äôm only 30. I know I‚Äôll die young and I‚Äôm ok with that.
175905875,I might get attacked while out. The men like that I‚Äôm stuck at home and if I go places that are enjoyable to me they‚Äôll want to ruin it and take me. They hate me and love my being afraid. If I make a mistake they‚Äôll take me in for questioning and torture me. _AT_MENTION_
175905876,That‚Äôs excellent. I‚Äôm retired.

175905880,Agreed it‚Äôs better to not force to just be natural as can be. Sometimes we forget it in the course of our lives. But there‚Äôs nothing to forget if it‚Äôs natural
175905881,I‚Äôm good. Relaxing at home with my fianc√©e. My sister comes to town tomorrow so that‚Äôs exciting. What are you listening to?
174330286,My mom told me that my sisters pdoc said her A1C levels are too high so he took her off her latuda and put her on lamictal I'm upset because my sister is also schizophrenic and lamictal is NOT going to prevent her psychotic symptoms. So I'm just waiting for the inevitable to happen now . Also I have a pain in my chest where my heart is located. But _USER_ID_ If its serious cuz I dont even wanna live any more any way.

175905884,I would say expect some withdrawal headaches. I always get those when I come off coffee
175905885,"That makes sense. Yesterday my pdoc confirmed that I was ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù but that I‚Äôd acquired over the years some considerable power of dissimulation, but then again, my so-called ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù (I‚Äôm not human, I co-created the universe etc) are not exactly calls for arms."

175905887,The hardest thing for me coming off benzos. ( and at one point I was also on 30mg) was cutting back from 10mg-0mg. I think it may have taken a whole year to get from 10mg to 0mg. It has to be taken very slowly. Unfortunately you will have to be patient.

175905891,My voices humiliate me and put me down‚Ä¶
175905892,"Sorry about that, I haven't really checked out how this works and wasn't sure how much detail to go into at first. We have had a very _PERSON_ 9 year relationship and he has been abusive to me at times. He's never been violent to the children but a couple of years ago he was getting pretty bad and there was an incident where he choked me in front of our son who was 4 at the time. He used to be a pretty good Dad and would play with the kids and do things with them as much as he knew how to. He came from a pretty abusive family himself so he struggled with how to just include them in his daily routines. For whatever reason though he changed. He stopped playing with them and most of the time was just annoyed with them. He would still be fun for them at times that were set aside for family activities like cookouts or things like that, but otherwise he just acted like he didn't want them to make noise or even really be around him much. After the incident where he choked me in front of our son and a few 
other things that were just too much to ignore I asked him to leave. He ended up moving back to where his family is which is about 5 hours away from our home. I have been trying to work things out with him since he left. I know he loves me and our kids. I think he battles depression and possibly some other mental or emotional problems. I've gone to great lengths to make sure he always has a way to stay in contact with the kids even if him and I are not speaking. We've pretty much just continued our same relationship with it's ups and downs since he left but this way at least I am safe and the kids are not effected by the constant fighting. So my problem is that after our most recent fight he decided to call CPS and tell them that I'm a drug addict and that he's concerned about the kids safety. He has threatened to have them taken from me before but after things calmed down between us he said he knows I'm a great mom and he was just saying that in the heat of the moment but would never do it. I'm not on drugs 
at all and I am the best mother I can be for my kids. That's actually one of the things we often fought about. He would say that I'm too easy on them and they're spoiled. I think he's always been a little jealous of how much I always put them first. I told him that if he tried to have them taken from the only home they know just out of anger toward me that I would cut off all communication with them and he would be out of our lives for good. To me that is just a cruel thing to do to the kids when he knows there's no grounds for his accusations. He just wants to make me look bad and says that the kids would be better off in foster care than with me. I don't know how he can say or think such things or how he can actually call CPS and try to have them taken from their home and say to me that he cares about them at all. I do know that he loves them and he will probably regret what he's done, but I feel like his actions this time prove that he's willing to hurt them for the sole purpose of hurting me. I don't know 
if cutting him out of their lives is in their best interest or if I'm just reacting to what he's done because I am hurt and probably overly emotional about it. I really just want to protect them and do what's going to be best for them in the long run. Sorry if that's too much information or not making much sense. I guess I have never really tried to talk to anyone about this and it's hard to try to say enough without saying too much. I'm welcoming any ideas or advice. Thanks for taking the time to even read any of this."

175905907,"Yes. If you went 5 months normal without ap‚Äôs that proves you were functioning without them. People here say don‚Äôt quit, but people do get misdiagnosed, put on the wrong drugs, and even 5% of people who actually have sz are able to quit meds at some point. The main safety net when going off meds is to be able to identify if and when you relapse so you can get back on meds before things get out of hand. You should write a list of things that happened during your recent psychosis like for example what kind of thoughts you had. Did you think about crazy things? Or Things that made no sense? Were you thinking incoherent? About specific delusions? Were you paranoid? It can be a good tool to have. If you can‚Äôt shake it off within a few days you are probably relapsing. You just need to be honest with yourself, and think that the worst case scenario is to go back on meds and that isn‚Äôt the end of the world. And you can always try to go off meds again in the future if you feel really stable and your 
intuition says you should try. If you think of this as your last chance to go off meds you might stress yourself and be reluctant to take meds if you relapse. Just keep the process relaxed and calm and you will be alright."

175905937,"You still need to know the people, even more so if you are going to read their minds. People that truly believe in this, usually don't diagnose, and most think everything is on a spectrum, and that everyone has traits of everything, it is just a matter of degree. So if you want to use your beloved approach, I deny the diagnosis. According to Stone, not according to others. I don't struggle with it. Its simply not enough for an actual diagnosis. Most serial killers are ASPD, but the reason is not because they murdered someone. That's why that type of argument is a circular argument, and adds nothing, no new information. Not really, he simply isn't a leading expert, and I looked at one of those shows where he features, and he has no method that is remotely standard. He basically looks at the type of crimes, and then give a number in his chart, and then diagnose because it is written in his chart. So his diagnosis is just garbage, and so are his stats, which are a lot higher than everybody else. And I 
don't give full credit to an article, I just know it is true, because it is the consensus. I just put it there so you could learn something, since you don't care about the consensus, nor about validity, just to defend some guy you think is an expert for whatever reason. I don't trust myself to diagnose people at a distance, no. Nor should you, or Stone. And that is especially true if you want to read his mind. You don't know if what you read is the whole truth, you only get what someone thinks is important, usually for dramatic reason. If you think that you can just look at someone and diagnose that person, in the same way a person might think the sky is blue, because they see blue, then it is completely external, and it follows the descriptive model, so pretending you know better because you can read mind at a distance does not apply here, does it? Even forensic psychiatrists often don't see eye to eye, and they make interviews with those they diagnose. Its far from being a perfect science, and people get bo
ught and have their bias. In fact it seems like the whole forensic science stuff is for the most part anti-scientific, but that is another story. Psychiatry and psychology as a whole, is also in a similar boat, which is why those diagnosis construct are being eliminated from modern research. But for those that actually use it, they should use it properly at least, even if it is still garbage in the end. Yes, you are right about that. Anyway, I am not interested in that issue anymore. I know the guy is a charlatan. I trust my own eyes on this."

174330306,"I‚Äôve found that some people with an immediate relative who has a disability can be less judgmental of our plight. I think being educated about disabilities and aware that some ordinary tasks can be a struggle for people with disabilities helps. The thing is most people without a disabled loved one could give a ???? about us and what we go through. The average person is not trying to hear about other people‚Äôs problems. I don‚Äôt really blame them for it either. In a way it‚Äôs kind of like how people with drug addiction are viewed. People don‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôve heard people say, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre self destructive.‚Äù My questions is, why (did they ‚Äúchoose to use‚Äù)? It isn‚Äôt until some wealthy person‚Äôs child dies of drug overdose that it becomes a problem worth investing in a solution for. The average drug addict [Similarly to saying ‚Äúschizophrenic‚Äù this terms sounds worse doesn‚Äôt it?] dies and sure the family hurts, but it doesn‚Äôt garner any movement or foundation to reduce it. H
eck, if a person on drugs is a minority or comes from poverty they often end up incarcerated. If a person with a mental illness comes from poverty, especially if they have do not have supportive relatives, they often end up homeless and drug addicted, at best they are institutionalized or moved to an assisted living facility where they share a room with someone and those are the luckier ones. I‚Äôve always felt a little sad that often times people with a mental illness are lumped in with those who have a drug addiction or have a mental impairment induced by drug addiction, but at the end of the day, at least someone is trying to help people somehow."

175905962,"Well my joke answer would be how I actually work. My secret to work is be totally clueless and unaware. Everybody leaves me alone and I can concentrate on my tasks instead of talking too much. I‚Äôve been working for quite a few years. Mostly labor and service jobs. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff I don‚Äôt like doing but I usually rise to the occasion. Just several years ago I was working at a department store called _PERSON_‚Äôs. My main job was putting away stock but we did odd jobs now and then. Everybody was required to work the cash register: except me. I worked with a few tough characters unloading trucks who gave each other a hard time all day but they were usually kidding but I was surprised to see them work the cash register. I was steeling myself for having to work the register and dreading it but they never asked me to. I was the only one who didn‚Äôt have to. I know they saw how I interacted with co-workers, I‚Äôm pretty shy but I can communicate OK and a few people liked me and I talked to t
hem. But eventually I could only get away with so much and they put me to work bagging merchandise. Which meant I stood a foot away from my co-workers while they rang up purchases and I put merchandise in bags. That‚Äôs what I call rising to the occasion, I did my job like I was supposed to and smiled a little and exchanged a couple words with customers and listened to the cashier. Anyways, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you except ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù. I will add that after I was diagnosed, no one expected me to work, they told me to concentrate on getting better so from ages 19- 22 I did not work.

Jumping through religious delusions including black magic is pretty common at the height of psychosis. In a few months he‚Äôll probably be embarrassed about it all. Some, if not a lot of us have been there. Using a psychosis for a break-up can be reason enough for most, but be conscious that many of us have been in the midst of madness. Hasn‚Äôt your relationship been on a precipice for awhile? If you are incompatible then so be it, but appealing to those who have suffered with such delusions may not fare well."
175905985,Really nice _AT_MENTION_
175905986,This started happening to me once I developed sz
175905987,Oh that would be great! I dont think they would accept that though. Maybe if there is a nice meeting in paris or so‚Ä¶but id neet more money. Hm. I will look into that.
175905988,"So im taking around 60mg a day now 20mg morning 40mg evening. That seems to work. Past 2 days I tried taking it all at night instead of twice a day. This evening by the time it had been 22 hours without another dose I started to get strange. Felt like id smoked a bunch of weed. Then I got paranoid, kept thinking people walking by on the street were watching me or out to get me. Then I kept thinking everyone driving in the cars were ghosts. and I felt like I was impaired I prob shouldnt of drove to pick up pho noodles. Then I thought I was in china when I went to pho. and all the violent thinking/impulses were back with a vengence. so definitely sticking to the twice a day dosing!"
175905989,"My doctor, and I have a good one, has never even mentioned my prolactin."
175905990,Have you gotten death threats from voices from sz. It can be hard. Just be tough and Stand your ground.
175905991,What symptoms is he having? I‚Äôd encourage him to look for a psychiatrist tomorrow.
175905992,Thanks SP. I'm overreacting and I know it and I can't seem to stop!
175905993,"I have a disorder that mimics MS, ALS, and other motor neuron diseases. I was initially diagnosed with ‚Äòneurotic disorder‚Äô but later my doctor found that I had upper motor neuron region damage. Do you have hyperreflexia (exaggerated knee reflex), clonus, or _PERSON_‚Äôs sign? Usually when you have any one of these symptoms the doctors will do their thing in finding the right condition. The problem is, motor neuron damage doesn‚Äôt happen overnight and you may have to wait 4-5 years for more damage to occur (as sad as it sounds). At least that‚Äôs what happened to me. I had no hyperreflexia 4 years ago but as the damage became more prevalent, the neurological signs started to show up. They usually do EMG for most people with MND but some motor neuron diseases don‚Äôt get detected via EMG. To be honest, MS symptoms can be pointing to so many genetic and autoimmune disorders and it‚Äôs really hard to figure this out. Spinocerebellar ataxia, spastic paraplegia, ALS, primal lateral sclerosis, etc ar
e all closely knit; this often requires genetic testing. And even with genetic testing, it‚Äôs hard to figure this out since some types of spastic paraplegia have not been discovered. I would just trust your psychiatrist and should any neurological signs occur, you should see a neurologist who is knowledgeable on motor neuron diseases and autoimmune disorders (rheumatology can also help). Keep track of your symptoms should any occur. I sometimes keep track of my own symptoms for my condition since I‚Äôm not entirely sure how fast I am degenerating. If you‚Äôre having pain, please take pain meds with moderation and see if you can do some physical therapy. Rest when you need, and most of all, don‚Äôt push yourself. I hope you are feeling better than before. I wish you all the best."
175905994,I‚Äôll be okay I‚Äôm sure. Just one step at a time
174330310,"Talk about it with your psychiatrist, maybe he can fix you. Clozapine is the most effective according to studies."
175905995,Flowers for _PERSON_ because I used to be a big nerd with big ambitions and now I‚Äôm content with a simple life but I‚Äôll never forget I once had a love for learning.
175905996,Same my sister has anxiety and I suspect depression my dad also has some type of anxiety or depression but I‚Äôm the only one who has psychosis.

175905998,Carbidopa prevents the breakdown of levodopa making it more effective. I will ask my Dr to prescribe it.
175905999,"That‚Äôs what I struggle with, thankfully my AP is taking care of it. Maybe you need to increase your dosage?"

174330307,"I‚Äôm schizotypal, we are pretty much the same as schizophrenics, but its rare to have hallucinations for a longer period when you are schizotypal. Some consider schizotypal as a milder form of schizophrenia, but i met schizophrenics that cope better than schizotypals. They got all the negative symptoms as well, often depressed. Schizoids are more of a withdrawn character, they often live alone and they are not bothered about being a ‚Äúloner‚Äù. Schizotypals wants to have company, but rarely succeed. I have had a few schizoids friends, very nice people, but not interested in friendship."
175906002,"I have that too‚Ä¶the pace of all the work is just to fast, there is too much pressure to be real efficient. People answer 150 mails a day AND do meetings and other work. I cant."
175906003,"I met my wife at work, think our coworkers told her when she joined the team that I have had psychosis. But told her on the first date since MI came up as a topic."
175906004,I‚Äôm not on abilify at all anymore.
175906005,I want as low a dose as possible. I only have delusions when im extremely stressed or have a real bad pms month though. Not always. And yes i meant the minimum effective dose! Which is different for all.
175906006,"Dry herb vaporizer is the best way I‚Äôve found. Most people smoke it, but to me it smokes very harsh."
175906007,"Drawing is an excellent hobby! First of all, that eye is amazing. And eyes are hard to draw! Second of all, hobbies aren‚Äôt about doing something you‚Äôre good at. They‚Äôre about doin something you enjoy. You don‚Äôt need to produce masterpieces in order to love drawing."
175906008,enjoy it‚Ä¶they can‚Äôt tax you if they sent you two‚Ä¶I would relax.
175906009,Its due to reduction in dopamine in certain regions in brain especially prefrontal cortex region.
175906010,"The Harbour Master There is so little compassion, these days I could sink into a washed-out haze Marked by Tears on faded Greys When all we are, is Martyrs Caught up in some long, lost cause When once we Dreamed, upon these Stars Why does it always seem so far? This Journey of mere Mortals Have no fear, Dear wounded Child I know it seems to have been a while But Love‚Äôs returned, and upon you smiles Cast your fears into the flame How does it end, this Tale we tell With our own Lives, until the Bell Of the _PERSON_ Master calls us Home It‚Äôs come time to draw near Be the best, that you can be Cuz you bring out The Best in Me Together, maybe we‚Äôll be set Free When the Harbour Master calls ~ _NAME_ ~"
175906011,"Sleep problems should be ruled out by your doctor first and sleep clinics are helpful. Sleep clinics monitor you thru the night to help eliminate any physical issues that may cause sleepless nights. They have very good techniques to help fall asleep. In my years of coping with sleep issues the best thing that has helped me are listening to stories or movies with no loud music . There are many new apps for sleep stories now, it helps to listen to calming voice and interesting stories to stop the self talk and worry that keeps us awake. It is helpful to some to listen to music."
