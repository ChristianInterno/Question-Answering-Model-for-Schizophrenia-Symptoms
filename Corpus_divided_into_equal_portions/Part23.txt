174379320,"Yes any antipsychotic can exacerbate negative symptoms. A chemical called dopamine in the brain is imbalanced in sz. In some parts of the brain there is too much and this causes positive symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, etc. In some parts of the brain there is not enough dopamine and this causes negative symptoms like anhedonia, flat affect, poverty of speech, etc. Antipsychotics are great for controlling positive symptoms because they reduce dopamine in the brain. Unfortunately this also reduces dopamine in the areas of the brain that are low on it, thus making negative symptoms worse. However, I have found that some APs will not have this effect, such as some of the newest ones like rexulti or vraylar and geodon was excellent for negatives. So don’t give up on finding the right med just yet Hope that clears things up!"

174379324,"Interesting. We had a crazy amount of mold in our house growing up from doing a roof installation. It poured down rain and we got mold all over the house. I think black mold or something. It was dark and black. My mom and family started having colds more often and sickness. My brother has a mild thyroid condition. I lived there on and off. We supposedly got rid of all the dang mold, but even my uncle thinks my mom’s constant sickness is from being exposed to mold. I can’t really blame my step-father but he lacks common sense a lot. Personally, I think my schizophrenia or unique profile of the disease is caused by an early viral infection caused by the Norovirus (I suspect a vaccine to come out soon but it’s only in phase 1 which is a huge disappointment). I’m terrible at math. I dropped out of college, but I did some estimates and my numbers were shocking. I probably screwed up the conditional probability part which might make my numbers or answer null and void because of independence or co
-dependent random variables. Anyways, I noticed the numbers of infections around the globe for bipolar and schizophrenia were close or almost exact to my norovirus calculations. It came in a damn dream or from a higher power. I call it psychic abilities. One of my fears is Big Pharma and Hospitals because they make billions off their products and the sick. It’s not just those two but others. You can get the shot or the pills for probably $10 in the future if the vaccine gets approved for the Norovirus. I’m going off the top of my head and memory here. I know I will never get a Nobel Prize because of my freedom of expression and _PERSON_ thoughts and posts lol. I really don’t want one either. I rather just take the cure independently and keep it hush hush and let you guys figure it out eventually in 50-100 years, but then I would feel bad and terrible and stuff like that. Honestly, I don’t know. My biggest problem is waiting for Phase 2 and Phase 3 and then approval and then hoping it works temporarily
. I’ve been studying conspiracy theories for a while especially _NAME_’s post on washing hands and eating clean food and stuff. I connected the two and my insanity and think I could have been him in a past life or different universe – or I could be absolutely batshit insane lol. My biggest problem is convincing my doctor to give me the vaccine in 2-3 years or whenever it comes out to prevent the Norovirus during the Winter Season. If I can help rid the world of the plague and terrible disease known as Schizophrenia I would be pleased as hell. It would mean the world to me. I have never seen suffering or experienced so much suffering as this man. I feel like curing schizophrenia is harder than the most complex physics problems and engineering problems in the world. There’s obviously an immune problem issue and other issues, but I can’t speak for anyone else. Just me. I did study some history on schizophrenia and the norovirus and it was sort of compelling. There is a genetic component too like twins 
and family members having a higher prevalence of getting schizophrenia if one member has it or the other. I recommend people do their research. I feel like I’m super clairvoyant sometimes which is just a fancy word for being able to see the future sometimes."

Because my mind is clear. Maybe the root of the issue insanity comes from the same “source” no matter which causes your illness. But if you ???? up yourself with drugs, and then CONTINUE to take drugs then you will do great cognitive and further damage. I have been sooo lucky to recover from this.

Background music is very popular in workplaces, and according to some investigations, can help increase attention at work if utilized appropriately. OBJECTIVE:This study investigates the influence of background music tempo on attention performance in employees with chronic schizophrenia. METHODS:A randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was performed to test the attention of 240 participants with chronic schizophrenia under four conditions, namely no music, fast tempo, slow tempo and white noise. RESULTS:Employees with schizophrenia achieved higher attention scores under background music than in a no-music environment. Additionally, slow-tempo music produced higher attention scores than fast-tempo music. CONCLUSIONS:Observational results indicate that slow-tempo background music is more desirable than fast-tempo background mus

Here is the topic I started on it Severe vocal outbursts +++ Also personally prayers only make my positive symptomes worse. Usually I just start shaking after specific points. There are also visions however. Ultimately it fuels my delusions even when I think that I already got rid of them. My mother has something similar too, except much, much more severe She chants prayers in two different religions, plus her own mantra that “came to her spontaneously” as she puts it. She also says that it is “the strongest one”."

Although my anxiety is still being sorted out, and my akathisia, I think by September this should be dealt with, as my new doctor seems good. I have not been in a hospital for two years now, and my relapses are being controlled by better insight, early interventions and the right medication and a decent team behind me. It has been hard, but I am hoping I can be that person who helps another like me who have been to hell and back. I had doubts as others who knew about me contemplating this, but I have been checking the crap out of everything to make sure it’s as water tight as a decision that I can make. My main motivation is to help people like I was when my life was getting ruined by drugs and alcohol as a teenager. If someone asked me who my role model is, it would be the Nurse who administered my 12 month com

176145659,So I’ve been doing pretty well except for some anxiety and one episode of voices. Since mid Nov I’ve been relatively depression free. But still get anxiety sometimes. One thing I’m really anxious about is my teeth. Years of neglect has caught up with me in my 35th year. I dread to think how many teeth I will lose by the time I’m 55 or 65! I hope I still will have teeth! It’s terrible to think of. I went to dentist today as one of my teeth broke off and she said I can either have a root canal and a crown - or extraction and a bridge. Sent me home to think about it. I’ve decided to get it extracted. It’s two teeth away from my previous extraction so my upper left teeth will be very gappy! Not only that but another tooth at the back with massive hole that needs to come out too and other smaller cavities in other teeth. I don’t know which side to chew on anymore! It’s quite traumatic to be in the dentists chair as I have sensitive gag reflex and x rays are a nightmare let alone root ca
nals! I can see myself anaesthetised completely before those back teeth seen to! If only we had a new set of teeth at 40 or so! Mid life start with clean slate. But no - only one chance we get. It’s hard to look after my teeth and go to the dentist with anxiety and sza. I guess I’m not the only one…

174379368,Sounds common delusional thinking. I’m not an expert like many psychiatrists are but you tell them these things you’ll most likely get the same answer. It’s delusional and I’m not an expert. Don’t get me wrong but realize there’s always an issue with your thought and thinking when you approach a psychiatrist. A good psychiatrist will know that what your saying is delusional. It’s not hard to spot. It’s like people who are on alcohol or drugs. You just know and their responses are pretty obvious. Your on a schizophrenic website and your trying to justify your delusions…Isn’t that very schizophrenic?

Other times you are mistaken. But they’re the aggressors and when you constantly lose the battle of defending yourself it makes you feel bad about yourself. But the thing is that you have as much right to be on this planet as anyone else. They know they are making you feel bad, they’re the ones who are as*holes and they are in the wrong. People get sadistic when they have power over you. It’s actually scary. Evil people have a knack for “spinning” a situation and even if you are in the right, they are going to push and push and force you to believe that you are in the wrong."

I have only been over night one time in any institution, and that was for burns suffered in a fire. Before 1978, I was in a lot of institutions. A fire in an apartment building near one of the State Mental Hospitals showed that one third floor resident made an escape rope by tying sheets together. The fire escapee was a State Employee, and the sheets, as photographed in the Newspaper, all said loudly on them, “Property of Norwich State Mental Hospital”. But we all know the aides are poorly compensated for their work, and psychiatrists have less status and less pay than surgeons. Typically, guards in prisons are paid more and have higher status than aides in mental hospitals."

It’s the same with you. _PERSON_ says it and you say it, the main problem is you and it sounds like you are already in a stable livng situation already. It sounds like an ideal place to work on your problems and sobriety. It sounds almost exactly that you are trying to run from your problems by moving.

I have not ever swim in a Australian lake. The waves in the ocean are a bit rough for me here in NSW where I am but thankfully they have some rock pools. In Sweden they don’t really have waves or tiny tiny tiny ones that are so gentle and tiny. Here they go surfing. Glad for you that you have music. Hope you enjoy making it and wishing you success.

174379399,"I am not sure there will ever be a 100% cure for schizophrenia, at least not in the form of medicine. Yes, better meds will be available one day. But the psychological damage that compounds this illness has to be adressed via therapy (which kind thereof? psychotherapy? CBT? remains to be seen) and also the patient must make it a point to do whatever they can in order to improve their life, such as : being physically active, minimizing addictions (smoking, drinking, drugs, video games etc), being socially involved etc."

You have to measure and track everything, same with calorie counting."
176145757,Yeah I can get palpitations or that feeling in my stomach something gonna go very wrong
176145758,Hey. I’m sorry you had to go through that. It’s whack. Sadly there were places like that around and other programs just as ineffective but well meaning. You’ve been around enough to know how wrong it was and your in a better place now for sure. I’ll tread lightly around this subject because I have some pretty hardlined views on such treatments. It’s sad you had to go through all that trauma. PTSD really is an issue that affects many people and often years later. I’d bring this up with your shrink. I think you said in an early post your off meds…I hope your still in touch with a shrink.

Little things… I meditate now and do deep breathing exercises… it really helps… maybe you could try that. Do mindfulness exercises…affirmations… anything that will help you focus on more positive things… the storms will come less or milder after awhile.

I only hear it when I’m at home, and only when a car is passing by (during such periods my schizophrenia plays that hallucination repeatedly for each car that passes by). If schizophrenia can recognize when I’m at home and when a car is passing by, it can probably also recognize what time is it - at least when you’re also aware of the time."

Keep learning and growing and your life will happen all in good time. You just need love like all the rest of us.

Specifically for you: something about nurses that even though I didn’t know the words, “hypnotically” came across as aggressive, And chauvenistic. I for one think accusations are cool… they allow for a defense. For my defense I have many male babies in the family. And I don’t like that a successful entrepreneur with the same, had to ask out loud about how to raise “strong boys” in this ‘climate’. It’s not all what you might think though, I’m content SO OFTEN and might have thrown in the towel of finding a partner a long while back without resenting anything about this subject. So back to you is there anything you feel like saying? It could be a favor I’m providing."
176145813,"The way nursing staff is run, it would be pretty similar. The managers are always trying to push the limits of what is a safe nurse to patient ratio, and they really pressure people to take overtime and not take sick/vacation days.

I have a bad back kidney problems and suffer from fatigue, and my knees are bothering me. Not to mention I need to lose weight. But hell, I drove 10 miles to _PERSON_’s to return an item and got my refund and went shopping to take advantage of a coupon. Wasn’t crowded and I ended up leaving with a new shirt. (That I paid for, lol) That’s how life works. It gets unbelievably bad but more often then not a reprieve shows up. I know you are super depressed and maybe hopeless but no matter how trite this sounds, things change and can get better. You have a good sense of humor and a good spirit. Hopefully your health problems are treatable and you can get back to living your life. I hope you feel better. Can you talk to your husband about this. Life is full of troughs where everything seems hopeless. Life is full of peaks and valleys. That’s just how it works. I 
know it’'s hard to accept sometimes, Hell, my neighbors want to destroy me. But even in the midst of all that, I still have good days. They ain’t going to ruin my night, I was out tonight and now I’m eating a McDonalds meal. They’re far away and 99? out of my head."

174379407,Yeah itd more complicated than that. I was previous diagnosed as having schizoaffective depressive type so they put me on a few different anti depressants and the last one sent me manic so they swwitched me to bipolar type. Theyve been trying to wean me off the anti depressant but every time i go lower i get suicidal and depressed. They lowered it by 10 mgs to see if that would help a few days ago and ive been spiraling since and was in a loud busy environemtn when i started feeling paranoid. It hasnt gone away. Its only been 12 hours since that happened. I emailed my therapist to get her help. And im on the pill not the shot

It may be partially a symptom on sz too, but I believe Invega is at least partially to blame. I’m hoping the switch to Abilify along with Sarcosine supplements will improve my situation.

174379414,"The clinical research says it’s no better than placebo… ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A Systematic Review of the Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on Schizophrenia Symptoms. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropsychobiology , 2019 Derangements of the gut microbiome have been linked to increased systemic inflammation and central nervous system disorders, including schizophrenia. This systematic review thus aimed to investigate the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation improves schizophrenia symptoms.By using the keywords (probiotic OR gut OR microbiota OR microbiome OR yogurt OR yoghurt OR lactobacillus OR bifidobacterium) AND (schizophrenia OR psychosis), a preliminary search of the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDANTR), and Cochrane Field for Complementary Medicine databases yielded 329 papers published in English between January 1, 1960 and Ma
y 1, 2018. Attempts were made to search grey literature as well.Three clinical studies were reviewed, comparing the use of probiotics to placebo controls. Applying per-protocol analysis and a fixed-effects model, there was no significant difference in schizophrenia symptoms between the group that received probiotic supplementation and the placebo group post-intervention as the standardized mean difference was -0.0884 (95% CI -0.380 to 0.204, p = 0.551). Separate analyses were performed to investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia alone. In both instances, no significant difference was observed as well.Based on current evidence, limited inferences can be made regarding the efficacy of probiotics in schizophrenia. Although probiotics may have other benefits, for example to regulate bowel movement and ameliorate the metabolic effects of antipsychotic medications, the clinical utility of probiotics in the treatment of schizophrenia patients remains to be 
validated by future clinical studies."

Never happend before - i reckon they finally got pissed off with my rants and venting down the phone. What a bunch of tossers. I actually think they are enforcing conduct boundarys on me - but it was only to let them know ive blocked no-number calls to my mobile, which is what they use. Bollox to them - they seriously got worse over the past couple of years, and when i do see them, they end up pissing me off anyway. Im considering binning them off, and letting the GP do my monthly jab in the future."
176145871,"The drugs I listed in my second post helped me maintain and then lose weight I am sure there must be something that can help? My current med Amisulpride 800mg is doing really well and has been the best so far I think it irritated my pdoc having a red line with weight gain but we worked together to find a med I was happy with Warning though, I did relapse a few times, lost my drivers license for two years and had a lot of time off work Not perfect way of doing it but the end result was good I tried risperidone but I couldn’t tolerate it"
176145872,I think you are just delusional. No one is watching you. You don’t fit the profile to be a spy. I hope you get to feeling better.
176145873,I think I have taken all the typicals except Navane. I hated them all. Geodon and Seroquel are doing me fine.

174379428,"Why are you guys upset over this? I don’t understand it. They called the diseases a burden, not the people who have them. Burden is a perfectly appropriate word to use in that context, and this is a regularly used phrasing that does not pass judgment in any way. There are many very valid reasons to be upset about how we are treated, but an innocent, regularly used term that many well-meaning researchers have used to describe our illness is not one of them."

176145879,"So, I googled a question about what to do if my neighbor’s house is burning down. Should I stand by to evacuate in case the fire spreads? I get a bunch of results about whose financial fault it is. Google seems so useless sometimes, especially if a search is related to money.

I am going to test myself in a machine that will measure dopamine and go under both ultrasound and allosteric signaling machine to see if find any chemical or neuronal changes. I also got back many test results that mostly came back normal. Only thing that was off was my A1c and prolactin. All other tests came back normal. And this testing was for schizophrenia. Last thing I need to do is do genetic testing and machine tests. It those tests come back normal then I will need to test some artificial possibilities."

176145892,Niacin can be very dangerous if taken in too large a dosage.

174379422,Zoloft has helped me also. Recently I’ve been put on 5mg of abilify for prolactin. However even though it’s a small dose I think that has helped too. My OCD (not officially diagnosed) before bed is much better.
176145896,How would you know that?
176145897,"I click that on every video,to make sure the algorhithm has no idea what my interests are. I also google random things to throw it off. It amuses me, but also I like thinking they don’t know my true interests."

176145905,I have not heard of you _AT_MENTION_! Don’t worry nobody knows anything about you. People are more concerned about their own thoughts.

176145909,It was easy for me to lose weight when I was 33. Even easier when I was 20. The older you get the harder it gets to lose weight. From your picture it didn’t look like you need to lose any.

176145913,2mg or 4mg?
176145914,Probably so. Should be ok
176145915,Good going _AT_MENTION_ !
176145916,I always thought that i tended to be neurotic and i used to make fun of that. I admitted that I had neurotic traits in my personality and i used to make a joke of it. I never thought that i would have a psychotic crisis. What did you think you had before it became clear that you have a psychiatric illness?
176145917,"Um, yes I would say I’m guarded."
176145918,"That’s a HUGE decision to have made! I’m so glad he is with people who love to care for him. It’s great that you’ve kept communication I think. That way your son understands his situation and that many people love him. I completely agree. Any shadow of a doubt tells me that I’m not ready. I don’t know that I’ll ever be but until that changes, if it ever does, the contraception stays."
176145919,No. Not really.
174379427,"I’m sorry to hear, man. I have negative symptoms but not as severe as what you are experiencing. I really wish you well and hopefully a med adjustment can remedy this apathy. Wish you the best _USER_ID_. Personally I don’t know what advice I can give since I’m not at the best spot. So I give you my support and are rooting for you!"
176145920,Those sound like delusions of reference
176145921,I try not to get distressed about things I can’t control. The thing that helped me was realizing that eventually I’m just going to die anyway and there’s nothing I can do to stop it so if I die young so what? I don’t have anything to do anyway.
176145922,I don’t give up cause i know that if you give up you will just come back to this world and will have to fight those struggles again till you accept life as it is and eventually join the one then. I also feel a lot of support from my parents and family and i wouldn’t want them to be left behind because i gave up.
174379431,I just tried it a short period. I woke up early in the morning or couldnt sleep at all. I was alert on it though on the day. Its also given for depression. I dont remember more. Hope it works for you.
176145923,"I was told it’s only 8 to 16 hours a week. Not a full time job. If I went off benefits, I would have to work at least full time, and I don’t know how I would handle that with my group therapy groups I’m going to plus the physical therapy on my bad back."
176145924,I oppose such a move _AT_MENTION_ . I hope for something else. Medications can only deal damage to my goal of physical fitness.
176145925,I use an antidepressant med that causes tiredness.
174379437,"Tell the doctor, multiple antipsychotic won’t help stick to one only abilify as adjunctive might help to lower prolactin level to normal. Try that if you want"
176145926,"This sounds interesting DCragg. Thanks for mentioning it. Though I never felt like having a seizure during the time I was under these really bright flourescent lights. Maybe it will get worse, I’m not sure. I hope not. Anyways, thanks for mentioning it and I’ll keep that in mind in future experiences of this weird symptom of Schizophrenia!!."
176145927,You can try it but ask your dr about it. It may interact with your meds. I am sure that its just a placebo effect if you slightly get better on it.
176145928,"If you have to ask, you probably aren’t ready to work. Can you get on disability?"
176145929,"I wasnt thinking about burning carbs it was more about going somewhere different and having an adventure, i love the place i walk bc it is so out in nature and i think its nice to have some time to myself in nature too, I also wanted to go out when it was cold bc it was more of a challenge and i said to myself ‘i can do this’ and ‘it’ll be fun’ and it was, i fell a few times though when i was on ice and forgot my ice grips."

174379430,"For so long i have always thought of myself as someone no one wanted to be around. It didn’t matter if, for example, at work i had a good working relationship with someone there, i would assume that they didn’t want to catch up with me outside of work. So i spent a lot of time being lonely. But recently i have put the effort into being more sociable with people that i like and admire. So far so good. I haven’t had any major issues, and at least half of them know of my Schizophrenia. Sometimes making friends means taking a few risks. It might not pay off all the time, but there will be some who are genuinely happy to be friends with you."

I stayed in shelters, hotels, slept on the streets for six months because I was afraid to go home. And while I was doing all that my cat got sick and passed away. I was devastated. I’ll never forget 2018."
176145956,Happy New Year!!
176145957,I went through a phase when I was younger when I thought I could send and receive messages via mental telepathy. I also thought (and sometimes still think) I can cause things to happen by mentally focusing on them during meditation. I believe I _NAME_ my husband to me by sending messages telepathically to the universe about the kind of man I wanted. It worked. So it’s hard to convince myself it’s not real. But I don’t think you can fight with someone telepathically because they too would have to have the power to do that. And that’s unlikely.
176145958,"I hate it so much! On the worst time possible my voices want me to see it a lot, I make an effort not to see it cuz it only makes me feel bad about myself… With that said, I think it only brings shame after they’ve done it and doesn’t help when they want to have healthy relationships. Mostly because their partners don’t understand that it was an “acting scene” and it wasn’t a real thing… Men usually have trouble dissociate porn sex from real sex… In my relationships I’ve always tried to be caring and a loving partner that makes my partners feel good about themselves, hoping that the sex was great for both of us and not only to me… After all, I try to think that sex is something that goes beyond or bodies, it’s our hearts too… Of course there’s sex for the pleasure of it, but to me it isn’t as fulfilling as love…"

If you have many that are very troublesome then yes by all means talk to your pdoc… Abilify was a good med for me with few side effects … my worst nightmare was putting on even more weight and abilify is one of the few weight neutral ones so I stayed and compromised because the other symptoms like increased anxiety were minor compared to psychosis… Just be sure this is definitely not the right med for you because they might not allow you to try it again …

176146001,I get it during the day so bad. I just can’t focus on anything. Then by the time night comes I’m too tired to do anything anyways. Its not a great way to live. I cannot figure out why I get the brain fog though. I got it before I was on any meds so it is not the meds fault. It could be narcolepsy related but I am taking my narcolepsy med. Even with that and caffeine I still get the dumb brain fog. Why?!
176146002,"_AT_MENTION_ , Yes it is! I was in a mini panic. I think I need to spend less time around my friend because, unlike you, I can’t resist when my friend offers me enticing food. Even after I’ve already eaten. Because I don’t usually get “full” like normal people do."
176146003,Well somebody has to show up for that.
176146004,Do you know who they are? And I know you might not believe me but it’s not real. You need the right med and plenty of rest.

I’m never in the mood to clean anymore, myself or my house. It’s very depressing. I’m overcome by dust mites. Piles of crap that I need to go through. For years I was plagued with an abundance of positive symptoms, now, the negatives are over powering me. I was diagnosed schizo affective 17 years ago."

If have 50 kg then just need 40 g protein per day which can easily obtain from regular diet and all those excess is excreted by kidney thus load on kidney increases and over time its function reduces.

174379460,"No. I asked for clozaril and they weren’t doing anything to prepare for it. No blood tests or anything. The doctor saw me for 2-4 minutes a day and the rest was just doing nothing.

But today when I went back, and there was a new girl in the office and she was crying , don’t know why but it made me realise I can’t feel that embarrased about crying before… and we all experience mental health so why I curse myself for being human I don’t know.

174379465,"Welcome to the forum. I’ve only had to deal with depression and schizophrenia. I did have some manic periods during middle school but I settled down. I generally feel well treated with my two medications latuda and clonazepam. The clonazepam used to be for anxiety but I said I couldn’t feel much effect from it, and stopped taking it as it was a take as needed medication, and generally I definitely don’t feel any different when I’m on it. I just am still on it because it has a fringe use for akathesia I didn’t know it helped with that, but I took it so rarely that I didn’t know the difference until I took it consistently. I know bipolar is pretty tough on people by itself so please feel free to share your troubles here and hopefully we can help calm you down if you’re feeling a bit upset."

176146116,A member of the family has a cough and high temperature
176146117,I take a little extra dose of meds and avoid the triggers if possible One trigger is having to take my husband to visit his mother. She makes me paranoid so I avoid it as much as I can but unfortunately I can’t always avoid it as I have to let him see his mom and it would look strange if he went alone. If I have to see her I don’t make much eye contact and I speak as little as possible or else she’d control my mind and gain access to my thoughts

174379478,"Those are too many meds omg. I was on Abilify, Benztropine and Zyprexa. I also tried lithium. The worst of those meds is lithium, it made me a zombie with a sluggish mind. Can’t you ask for a different mood stabilizer? Abilify is the best for negative symptoms unless you get addiction and hypersexuality issues from it. I would replace the Olanzapine with Risperdal, much less weight gain. Oh yeah, talk to your Dr about all this of course."

I am trying to maintain another type of relationship with the other and have a good time, like it was before. I know it might sound crazy, but I do think there could be a good life with the voices and a happy ending, were there’s no bad around but it would take some good communication effort. Something I am really terrible at is communication. Oh and believe me Ive tried about everything to keep them talking to me but it doesn’t work, in fact to overkill this topic they would rather have me quited and by that I mean unable to talk than to see me try again."

I’ve also thought they were at times tracking me through echo location."

176146160,If the outcome is good I’ll be ok but there is nothing good about the process. I don’t even pick up my mail more than twice a week because I’m terrified.
176146161,"Thanks, that gives me hope. I am indeed better compared to when I started Risperdal, I was sleeping all day, 16h/day."
176146162,"In the UK I think it’s the law to have 20 days plus the 5 or 6 bank holidays My old job I got 25 days plus bank holidays Now I am self employed, I just factor in holiday pay in my day rate"
176146163,I’m glad this wasn’t another click bait.
176146164,_PERSON_ very much life is pretty tuff these days… lotsa smoke here in California during covid… im pretty bashed up emotionally… Thank you for the kind hearted response
174379482,"The meds probably won’t work for most of what you’re describing. And I think if they do work for some of it, you would have noticed it by now. APs can take a while to work for positive symptoms, but they don’t work very well for anxiety and it doesn’t take long for whatever effect they have on anxiety to kick in. They also generally don’t work for depression."
176146165,I don’t think the r word is used at all by health care professionals in the uk anymore (but I may be wrong).
176146166,Yes they can see under a microscope big increase in number of receptors.
176146167,"I Don’t Know Where is, What is, It is Love…, Questions Unending…, A Bird Notes Sending."
176146168,_AT_MENTION_ Thanks for the tips but I think Ill need a few years of training before my voice is good enough to do this myself lol
176146169,"I suffer from intrusive thoughts, and so far they’ve been so overpowering, the only thing for me to do is hope they go away on their own. Which ususally happens after a buttload of prn and extra sleep. However, it’s starting to keep me from being able to do things in my everyday life, like participate in conversations and remember things. Or even form sentences if they’re particularly bad! The intrusive thoughts mostly revolve around my birth name for some reason. I could really use some advice! And I don’t mean “wear a light hat”, but like, actual scientific methods to get rid of them quicker. Anyone?"
176146170,"10 years, though i was on and off in the beginning"
176146171,I’m now on Seroquel 400mg. That’s in addition to my monthly shot of Resperidone. It’s supposed to help me not get worked up about the neighbors.
176146172,"You might try L-theanine in the future. I know it won’t help you now, but the woman who sets up my med’s missed both my Geodon and my Seroquel a few weeks back, and the _PERSON_ got me through that."
176146173,I don’t have anhedonia anymore
176146174,"_AT_MENTION_ Totally agree I think this Journal needs to been taken WITH A LARGE PINCH OF SALT! Congrats on Countdown, I myself have what is known as a Photography Memory and can remember almost everything I read/listen too._PERSON_ also a Sports/Rock Music Historian!"
176146175,"Its not bad but its the most effective AP. Yes, its used in patients who are treatment resistant."
174379488,I started rocking back and forth in September or October of 2015 when I was first diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was put on Zyprexa. I stopped Zyprexa last year but I still rock sometimes if I don’t feel like sitting still.
176146176,I believe I can fly.
176146177,Kind of hard to do in person. Although I would be less embarrassed
176146178,"I’m glad you laughed at that. Don’t get me started on visions, lol."
176146179,I have been. It’s got me a little calmer now. Still working on chilling out though
174379485,"I used to take _NAME_ semi-seriously. He got my attention. Never bought or read any of his work, but I’ve been to his website. Part of the appeal, is that we can get better and that anti-psychotics make us sick. I think we’ve all felt that the pills made us sick or worse at least once in our lives. For me it was my negatives that got worse. That the pills never really helped me with my delusions or dissociation. It took 5+ years to get better. It started with a new pill called Vraylar. I’m still disabled, but not suffering. I tried every supplement out there too. Maybe a few did the trick and helped cure me; I don’t know. But I’m one of the few that got really angry for a while and at my doctors. The doctors seemed like they were practicing inefficient methods and outdated science – basically junk and psuedo- science."
176146180,"No, I never heard of flooding. I’m sure, at my age, I’d freak out."
176146181,"I had derealization in mid 2018 up to mid 2019. I’m certain it was the Paliperidone causing it The Doctors gave me meds for no reason. I used to feel disconnected, panicked and lost. I wouldn’t know where to look. It was a very strange feeling. I know aps work for other people, but it is poison to my body and mind."
176146182,Love exists. But its important to remember there are many different kinds. Romantic love is nice but platonic love is just as important.
176146183,I like the song and the name of the song
176146184,Lol. You have a more Australian sense of humor _AT_MENTION_ . Self depreciating humor is par for the course over here but I found rare when in America. I would have laughed and I suspect that it was all ok. Your a natural which is rare to be quick witted. It really is but it will hold you in good stead when your chatting to people.
176146185,"I think you just gotta settle this. If you don’t, they aren’t going to jail you, but it will reflect further tries to order items and the credit card company. You need to settle with the credit card company and merchant to do further business with them. But know they aren’t going to drag you to court over that amount because court fees would be costly for them. However if you have a history of doing this, it will effect your credit and hurt your reputation as a good customer."
176146186,I don’t think that’s a good idea
176146187,Mostly when I’m driving for whatever reason
176146188,That’s great _NAME_. Even just cutting out the alcohol can help you loose weight drastically. But exercise on top of that is even better.
176146189,"I’m in the same boat sometimes too. I regret some of the choices I made after having a nervous breakdown. I just wasn’t in a clear frame of mind, and made a lot of bad choices that still affect me to this day But, it’s not too late to change some of these things anyway. Trying to create some better habits for myself now"
176146190,"Hi, Has anyone experienced anhedonia on Invega?"
174379493,Risperidone Abilify Lamictal Zoloft
176146191,Teens years? _PERSON_ Guns N roses Bon _USER_ID_ Metallica _PERSON_ I started off hair metal and then moved to harder stuff.
176146192,hi everhopeful. how did your new day start? i am feeling a bit better this morning. to a wonderful (hopefully) weekend!!! _NAME_
176146193,Been there _NAME_. The word continuing feels so good I want it tattooed on my arm. Just had a review myself in October. Received the notice the day before my birthday. Believe me when opening that letter I didn’t care if I was about to turn 37. What a relief. It was my only one for like eight years but I suppose now it will be a three year thing.
176146194,"I’m rubbish at budgeting hence why they say I lack capacity and don’t have access to my money. I get a personal allowance of £150 a week to spend on what I like. I need to get food out of this though. I’m lucky that I have a very good social life and spend at least £100 a week on eating out and coffees, especially after lockdown, I wish I would save at least £100 a week."
176146195,"The radio station that i volunteer at has been hit hard with the lockdown and it has lost 70% of its funding streams, its a fight for survival now I really hope we can do it"
176146196,"I loved my pregnancy, It was really beautiful. And the dads were there when he was born, That was also very special. We still talk every couple weeks, via video chat. He knows I’m his mom and stuff. We have a very open relationship. It’s really the best of both worlds."
176146197,"I am with you _AT_MENTION_. I am without any medications and making big progress. The progress is painful and difficult, but there it is. I have to clarify that I use alternative, non-medicative methods to control intrusive thoughts."
176146198,"I have semen and sz ruined my life. My gf left me bcz of my sz and bcz I couldn’t work, I became non-social and somewhat antisocial too. I became violent with her forcing her into sex."
176146199,Start going to AA meetings. That might help you
176146200,Your obsession with things you can’t prove or disprove is a sign of relapse in my opinion.
176146201,"Spacing your meds out can help with fatigue. Instead of feeling really tired right after your dose, you feel less tired, but throughout the day."
176146202,My dad started drinking every night during law school he’s had 6 dui convictions and stays in the basement drinking or at a bar coming home at 3 am. Well he still stays in the basement and drinks but not bars he’s 70 he’s addicted his nerves are shot and he is hooked on conspiracy theories I think due to isolation. He retired early and has no energy no motivation does no chores he’s basically a bum that my moms still married to. It’s a loser life and I don’t recommend it.
176146203,"“sane” people around me say “so what?”, even if there is the matrix or _NAME_ show or solipsism. I can’t say that. For me it’s an urgent issue that needs solution"
176146204,I feel you. We are here for you here
176146205,Mine seemed to worsen since the return of my sza in 2012. But I’ve not been entirely med compliant over the years so maybe that’s why
176146206,My mother tried abortion and it failed. I think I was hurt. I feel nothing but pain now.
176146207,"You are not on TV or radio. Every time I ask you for a single example, You ignore me because you know there isn’t one."
174379490,"I used to struggle with taking meds when I was younger because I was angry that I had a mental illness due to the _USER_ID_. When I was hospitalized my first time I had a bad attitude and gave the staff mean looks. Later, I also thought I didn’t need them because I could stop taking my meds for 3 to 4 years and function "" normally"". But, then slowly the paranoia and delusional thinking would creep back in and I would have to take a leave of absence from work to get myself together and get back on the meds. I finally got the message that I have to stay on my meds as I became tired of of going back and forth with this over the years. I eventually had to go on disability though because the work related stress got to be too much. I used to take a combo of Haldol and Cogentin but now my PA has me on Abilify. I no longer have any positive sz symptoms but still struggle a bit with the negative."
176146208,Honestly a couple of months _AT_MENTION_
176146209,nice of you to want to spread it to all =) i’m glad to hear you doing well! i’m doing pretty good too… don’t go outside much but i’m glad with how life is currently.
176146210,"I get it. You’re convinced that risperidone had side effects you didn’t know to expect. Have you looked at the leaflet you get with each drug from your pharmacy? I do. You should. I’m not saying that it did or didn’t cause side effects. I AM SAYING that the side effects are most likely listed. Sometimes, they use big medical terminology. I wish you well, but it’s probably better that you talk to a pharmacist. They, generally make sure the side effects are listed. Your pdoc is not to blame here."
176146211,"Aw, thanks _PERSON_! You’re so nice! Inferno is good! Just doin’ snake stuff."
176146212,"Sometimes it feels like my body isn’t mine. Like I don’t know how touchy the “gas” and “breaks” are, can’t stay upright because walking doesn’t totally make sense, etc. It doesn’t happen a lot, but it has happened. I’m wondering if it’s part of dissociation related to PTSD (what I was told it was), a leftover from some drug habits (some more recent than others, but assume all the things have been used), or part of psychosis. It ultimately doesn’t matter much. Maybe I’d just feel better if it was a thing I didn’t do to myself. Or if I knew my current meds can prevent it."
176146213,2019 absolutely flew for me I spent the whole year doing nothing trying to figure out if the voices were not real. Took me 8 months
176146214,"I’m glad to hear, you scared me"
176146215,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ . That’s why I avoid my family also. I hope you feel better this morning.
176146216,I quit. But I switched to vaping.
176146217,"Just want to add few things here. So you’re 15 years old. Just want to say that you’re new to this all and the whole life ahead still. The sooner you admit that you’re in a need of help, the quicker you can recover and come out of this. I was 23 years old when I was diagnosed. A lots of us have been gone this through and lots of us have denied stuff just like you. So believe me when I tell you that, you could fight back for the next 10 years and go the hard way - or just take a big leap forward and skip all the upcoming fights to come out of this a lot quicker. The sooner you wear a smart-hat on - the more faster you can outcome from the common early-stage struggles. Don’t fight the health-care system, - rather fight to get your life together. The people in the healthcare can help you with that."
176146218,_AT_MENTION_ where did you buy the device? I would be interested in trying it myself
176146219,"Not really, I don’t think I do at least. Drs always write I have good eye contact"
176146220,So finally did moves 1-50 of the _NAME_ style form today just after 12:00pm. Still need a bit more space to do them comfortably in. Hopefully by the end of the week I will be more fluent in the new moves. Thank you.
176146221,"I did take one Ativan today, so I’m good."
176146222,"It is a little freeing to only think about survival, though it was obscured by psychosis. I really don’t want that experience again however"
176146223,If you mean Abilify injection then yes I’m on it
176146224,Getting my injection doubled Monday. How long will it take for it to work?
176146225,I do nothing and never worry. I got used to do nothing. I guess its not healthy and its from no emotions and no motivation.
176146226,I cleaned the kitchen and both bathrooms in the house today. My third task for the day will be tidying up my bedroom.
176146227,"I didn’t arrive at the thought I was psychotic, during the psychosis. It takes awhile to clearly think."
176146228,_AT_MENTION_ just a minor question. can you draw a guy with eagle wing on his back?
176146229,"The point is that they don’t contradict each other. Seemingly contradictory studies usually have different results because of methodological reasons, and _NAME_-analyses show that they don’t really contradict each other when you factor in comorbid drug use and other factors like socioeconomic status. The studies point in the same direction - mental illness generally does not cause much violence. But when you trust journalists to inform you about science, it will seem like we know nothing and no one agrees. That is a lie that is propagated for political reasons."
174379491,"Of course. Back then I was taking zyprexa, abilify, haldol. Now haldol injection and clozapine orally"
176146230,We had a jam session with a friend today.
174379496,"I have been told, but I don’t think I’m and I doubt it."
176146231,Yes. I am just a player in this simulation.
176146232,"to me they are boring experiences but very relaxing. i love the food. i like the activities they have for you. the people are weird but nice. if i’m delusional or hallucinating, it can still be hellish some too."
176146233,i dont have any strength anymore.
176146234,The urge and craving dictating your day
176146235,Good to hear you have some peace of mind. Nothing worse than runn i ng out of meds.
176146236,Great work _AT_MENTION_! My favorite is the black and White House. Looks like an album cover.
176146237,"Probably getting sick of me talking about naltrexone. But I’d say the most important thing it does for me NOW. As it has evolved overtime,How this med has effected me. Is help my cognitive abilities. Part of that is due to its helped me quit drugs and alcohol. Has helped my cognitive ability. But the med itself seems to help me too in this regard."
176146238,"I don’t think $1 million would change my thick-headed indecisiveness. I don’t think I need a lot of money to change my life, just some key revelations. Mainly have to figure out how to reduce my brain inflammation to zero, then my thoughts will be calm and productive."
176146239,"I’m sorry you’ve not been receiving support. I see some posters who are quick to judgement, but they are the minority. I definitely have wanted to leave a few times, but there are people here who care. I hope you reconsider leaving. Maybe take a few days or a week and think about it. You are a valuable member of the forum and I’d hate to see you go."
176146240,"Do you practice gratitude? Since you love other people, perhaps expressing it to them might be helpful. Church, community, family gatherings. Everyone can heal"
176146241,Megadosing is when people take something like 500mg a day.
176146242,Very beautiful! Nice work.

176146244,I believe in destiny. So there isn’t a lot you can do at the moment but try. Never give up and never blame yourself for not being able to achieve this goal. the only thing you can really do is resist and be conscious that there is a destiny and a god.
176146245,Santa is a super spreader and that’s why christmas is cancelled. He’d been naughty not nice.
176146246,Yes and I just don’t have anything to talk about.
176146247,"My voices are positive and upbeat. They give me guidance and how to act in awkward situations. Sometimes they make me laugh. Some of the voices are now entities and I love them as family. I know that its considered bad, but what’s the harm? It just cheers me up. I’m careful to follow all my “day” responsibilities first, work, care for my little one, clean, spend time with people. Then right before bed, I open the channels and they come flooding in."
174379498,"I think I used to drink too much diet cola, about 2 liters a day and I sold my house and moved away. There’s a higher incidence among immigrants. That’s when it happened. And people were always interfering in my life."
176146248,His brother will like you a lot less if you say that. It’s better to say your dr recommended you eat less salt. Eat very small portions of his food so he’s not offended.
176146249,What med are you on if I may ask?
176146250,I’m very scared to ever drink alcoholic beverages again in my whole life. Sounds like your husband really cares about your wellbeing to me.
176146251,"Haven’t tried those. Anyways a healthcare professional knows best what to do. If you have been on those for several weeks with no improvement I would get a appointment with your doc to discuss changes, or even change doctor if they are not taking you seriously."
176146252,I also believe it’s demons very much. There’s no other way to explain it. But I see angels too. I don’t know if I’m being warned Against something or tortured or what I told my pdoc about it. Of course he said it’s delutional
176146253,Maybe look for a part time job that offer flexible hours. I worked at fast food chains a lot and asked for more hours when i was feeling well and reduce my hours when I was feeling unwell.
176146254,"I’m just asking her cos an increase or addition of a, med may make negatives worse."
176146255,"Education is not an issue I get A’s in university and have a major degree in physiotherapy. I can’t work, I can’t even volunteer, I rage quit 15 different jobs after 1-2 weeks from stress."
176146256,"Good for you. Congrats for helping. And nothing like scoring some points with people, even if it’s those people. I helped my co-worker who was having some trouble with a loud neighbor. I gave him the name of an agency who gives free legal advice to the mentally ill and even goes to court for free. Their main focus is housing issues."
176146257,_AT_MENTION_ But wouldn’t it be worth it get off meds to see if you’re at part of the first 33%?
176146258,Sounds like the tapping in my roof is trying to catfish me
176146259,"Thank you! I’m reading more into catatonia. It is terrifying. I haven’t had symptoms where if someone tried to move me, I wouldn’t move. But it’s a possibility since there are other forms."
176146260,Same here _AT_MENTION_ . I am tired of this. They say I am dying soon. What can I do about this? They are watching me and condemning me. Sorry you heard a beeping in your ear. I know it must be frightening. I hope you feel better and pray you will get better.
176146261,Psychiatrist for my hair that’s a thought
176146262,…looks like a cross between a dark _NAME_ and the illuminati…
176146263,"Well you should. Or maybe you shouldn’t, it can trigger psychosis"
176146264,"Made it through another family baby shower. I am really happy for them. Making 4 layer cake - two chocolate layers, two white cake layers. Not sure how to frost them yet. Spent time with distant family."
174379512,"after i increase my geodon, i been having problems with my heart. im been takiing 60mg twice a day."
174379500,These sound more like negative symptoms of schizophrenia. (Some can also be a result of cognitive symptoms or meds)
176146265,"Reading at the moment a book called The Monk who sold his Ferrari. About seven life changing principles like thinking inspiring thoughts, finding your purpose in life, self improvement, good habits, discipline, serving others and living each day as if it were your last, and living in present moment. Now I’m wondering - if I put these things in practice could it cure my sza? Could I come off meds if I think positive and improve my life? And could disciplining myself cure my avolition? Any thoughts?"
176146266,"In Greece we say “nothing bad, without good” Bad things have positive aspects. One must be patient"
174379507,Okay i will setup a appointment with my pdoc. I ask to put me on latuda or abilify but she did not want too idk why.
176146267,I’d call your pdoc or whoever handles your care. You’ve got to much on your plate right now and you need help
176146268,"I’m not doing well. I’ve been getting worse and was on and off different meds a lot lately because nothing is really working. I’m at the point where my delusional thinking is making me feel very frustrated and I can’t do anything because almost anything ends up being a trigger. What can I do to distract myself while I start taking Zyprexa again to take my mind off things? I’m really losing it and am getting a lot of negative thoughts about life. Thinking about suicide, but that’s okay because I’d probably just ???? it up so I’m not likely to do that as surviving would only make things more depressing. Currently I’ve been spending a few weeks just sitting in front of the computer. Not even using the computer, I just sit there mostly. I can’t watch TV or play games, for some reason I just get weird or depressed doing those. Before this came about I was in a manic hyped up state. I don’t know what to do, please help."
174379510,I just went from 10mg Zyprexa to 5mg Abilify. I’m starting to have hallucinations and think they are ghosts. I’m going to try to get my dose upped.
176146269,"Anyone struggle a lot with grief over loss due to / caused by your illness? Loss of dreams, job, relationships, abilities, health, time, self, time with family, participation in life, etc etc etc Sorry to be a downer. Just having a hard time tonight. I’ve been told to accept and reinvent myself. Good advice but easier said than done, and doesn’t get rid of the grief for me."
176146270,"Thanks you too, I am listening to reggaeton music. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, etc"
174379504,I will try to if he doesnt prescribe Geodon. He doesnt want to change my meds at all. He said that many times.

176146272,"I love the smell of coffee too. I’m on my 3rd cup of coffee, I think its enough. But I’m off to a meeting here in a bit, to see what’s up. But for the most part is just try to stay active and alert. I been good, they refilled my risperdal prn so I’m doing a lot better. How about yourself?"
176146273,"I wasn’t that surprised, because my mother had it. When she was diagnosed, she didn’t believe the doctor."
176146274,I want _PERSON_ hummus and veggies. I’m going to have it for lunch today
176146275,"I wrote about _NAME_ in a memo, a rap I made and several others I made. Also when I worked at Barnes and Noble I think I unwittingly was helping fund terrorism somehow. That doesn’t make sense though because the money went to the company. I’m just paranoid that I did this somehow. Also I was in random locations at random times. I’m just afraid I was a terrorist somehow that I can’t explain."
176146276,Trying = result= reward
176146277,How are you with hygiene and having a structured routine? I struggle with hygiene at times and lack the motivation to do anything. I find I need a routine to help me reach goals or else nothing gets done.
176146278,"If you recognise other people’s cases then surely this disproves solipsism? Is obsessional solipsism a fully fledged delusion? How can 40% of your peers who happen to be sz, when peers are the the same people as you be any measure of psychosis? That is why psychosis spectrum disorder is a preferable status as fully fledged sz suffers from paranoia, voices, fully fledged delusions, catatonia, disorganised symptoms and self neglect. If you suffer from one on the spectrum, it is not so bad as the _USER_ID_ of sz, is it?"
176146279,I cannot snap out of it … work hates me… wants to get rid of me
176146280,"I don’t see a way out of this dark hole. I lost so much of myself. This debilitating physical disease literally took my life away. I can never walk normally like other people, and I will be forced to deal with any complications arising from this illness. Eventually my legs will not work and I will probably barely use them.

174379509,"I think people after schizophrenia learn different, but they still learn. Memory problems might hinder the learning process as well many side effects of medications interfere with cognition, this apart from the characteristics of this disease. I would say that a specific oriented teaching method so the schizophrenic students could develop themselves to a new level, to uncover fully potential, this would be interesting. Evaluation, assignments, tests, exames rely on specific memory skills but there is more about to learn with different able skills. I believe the schizophrenic learner has strengths as well weaknesses but it is much better to learn something with purpose and support, then not to learn. Traditional education even superior education does not suit schizophrenics learning needs, so there is exclusion, drop outs… more reasons to add to the pile of the reasons to not study or learn. I think it should exist special education for the public with schizophrenia condition, adapted to our reali
ty but not underestimating us. For this we would need also teachers and tutors trained to teach people with this condition, and adapted programmes. This is my modest opinion. What do you think?"

174379513,"Well I went to see a new pdoc. He suggested following the rehabilitation and recovery plan, and going to the clubhouse, and said my will will come back. I see no purpose in it. I’ve been robbed of all of my emotions, feelings (except pain and senses), thoughts and will. I’m incapable of wanting anything, I have pretty much complete anhedonia, I don’t like doing anything, nothing is interesting, and nothing is funny any more. The only thing I still have is the pleasant taste (which the voice/inserted thoughts claim is a ‘fake pleasant’ taste, and helpful in torturing me after death), unless my schizophrenia decides to take it away (which seems to happen often recently, with desserts), and unpleasant alien feelings. My body is now in the basic survival cycle + eating sweets + helping mom. There appears to be an on/off switch for my thoughts and will, but my schizophrenia has kept it in the “off” state for the past 2 years. There doesn’t seem to be any indication of it going to turn it 
back on. I asked if my schizophrenia can be smarter than me. He said a disease can’t be smarter than me. I gave him the reasons why it seems to be the case (how my schizophrenia came up with things I never thought of, related to some projects I had planned and things I’ve done wrong). He said he doesn’t know what to say. I’ve been told “You would have probably come up with the same things”. But I didn’t! One small project already failed, because I could not come up with a working solution. But my schizophrenia could - it came up with a method that would have been successful, as soon as the thing came up in my mind. He said the brain can’t invent new, alien feelings. My schizophrenia is apparently capable of instant feeling invention. Once when a woman touched me when I was walking by I felt a ‘female touch’ feeling in my hand where she touched me. One day my mom called me, and instantly I felt a ‘getting caught in doing something wrong+guilt’ feeling, while I was lying in the bed. A fe
w days ago I heard children scream outside, and the childrens’ screaming had a ‘terrifying+dangerous’ feeling to it. All of those are alien feelings, which I have never felt before. He suggested to go back to the previous pdoc, and ask for an increase in the quetiapine dose (currently at 200mg)."

174379533,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Sex Differences in Clinical and Functional Outcomes among Patients Treated in an Early Intervention Service for Psychotic Disorders: An Observational Study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and A Malla, Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie , Jun 2019 12 It has been shown that men with a longstanding psychotic disorder have worse clinical and functional outcomes than women. Our objectives were to examine whether these sex differences are also present among patients treated in an early intervention service (EIS) for psychosis and to determine if these differences are related to risk factors other than sex.Patients (N = 569) were assessed for demographic/clinical characteristics at entry and for symptoms/functioning over 2 years of treatment. Clinical outcomes included remission of positive, negative, and total symptoms. Functional outcomes included good functioning and functional remission. Logistic regression models examined the r
elationship between sex and outcomes after 1 and 2 years of treatment while controlling for the influence of other risk factors.Men reported to be less educated and have a longer duration of untreated psychosis, poorer childhood and early adolescent premorbid functioning, higher rates of substance abuse/dependence disorders, greater severity of baseline negative symptoms, and poorer baseline social/occupational functioning than women. Women were more likely to achieve symptom remission than men after 2 years of treatment (negative odds ratio [OR], 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.78; total OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.98). Women were also more likely than men to exhibit good functioning (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.49) after 1 but not after 2 years of treatment. These results did not persist after controlling for other risk factors that could confound these associations (i.e., childhood premorbid functioning and age at onset of psychosis).Sex differences seen in outcomes among patients treated in 
an EIS for psychosis may be largely influenced by the disparity of other risk factors that exist between the 2 sexes."

My relationship with food around this time was very sick. Eating and gorging myself was almost orgasmic lol! If you just recently got prescribed Zyprexa, please be warned about the appetite increase, no one warned me and I got up to 170 lbs. If it gets out of hand, a person could end up with some serious medical conditions, diabeties for example. Take care of your body. Watch what you eat, make yourself exercise. I wish you the best"
176146401,"_PERSON_ was watching Australian Rules Football on ESPN and anticipating the National Frisbee Golf Championship which was following. _PERSON_ thought to himself, “Now this is different. I wonder what is going on?” Then a call from Italy came over the phone. ""Son, said a voice which was struggling to talk. Your parents are about to die from something called the coronavirus. _PERSON_ said, “Cool they are going to Heaven right?” The voice said, “Sure. They’d like to talk to you.” “Ray,” said the Mother. ""When your father met me he was a mafia hitman and I was a prostitute who was poll dancing when your father said, “I want to make a dishonest woman out of you.” I said, “Don’t you mean honest?” and he said, “Hey I’m a mafia hitman and I’m one botched job away from death so I have to make it after communion so I can go to Heaven by being honest.” I said, “But isn’t killing wrong?” And he said, “No that’s divine justice.” So after we argued a while over t
hat topic he said, “Let’s get married and 9 months later you came along. Now excuse me while I die.” _PERSON_ took in the information and thought “That’s cool. Wait till I tell the fellows at the bar.” Then the nurse gave the phone to the father who said, “Son all my work as a hitman led to you becoming a priest which I’d like you to return to. Now it’s my turn to go.” _PERSON_ started to protest and say, “No. I like marriage too much.” But then he said, “Sure Dad. Anything you say.” He then said, “I love you guys.” and their voices came from above saying, “Love you too.” So _PERSON_, his wife, and his kids went to Italy after the virus was over to bury his parents and said to the coffins, “Sorry but I stayed married, and a Maytag repairman. But I am going to communion more often.”"

Tumblr user hxhaunt: hm so psa bc i didn’t know this, it’s not common knowledge, and flu season is around: apparently you aren’t supposed to take dextromethorphan (a common cough suppressant. it’s in stuff like cough syrup, mucinex dm, tylenol severe cold) with sertraline (aka zoloft, the antidepressant) bc it has the risk of causing Serotonin Syndrome, which is not as fun as the name suggests. i’m not a doctor but like, avoid drug interactions bc they can be serious. remember to read labels guys aaa Tumblr user kurapikawithagun: Not just sertraline, any SSRI or SNRI. Serotonin syndrome can kill you. When I was younger and on a lot of medication, a dose of cough medicine landed me in the ER. Always check potential interactions here before taking anything with antidepressants, even if it’s over-the-counter. Tumblr user chronicreality: ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ask a pharmacist. Do not rely on quick googling or websites because ingredients in things change too ofte
n. Just call your pharmacy real quick and ask if X over the counter medicine will interact with your prescriptions. Not to mention Drug A and OTC Drug B might have no interaction until you add Drug C so just googling interactions isn’t enough if you’re on multiple medications."

Then the right of said militias and people involved which own guns, have the correction toward that right. But if you think, any intoxicated fool Wheeling Round a dead body has any right to create such rot, you do not know either the letter or the spirit of Law of Love, nor the conspiracy of Hope That Made The Big Bang. I was allowed to fire a .22 rifle in summer camp. It was fun, sorta. I never felt compelled to make the purchase. So, I figured, if bought a gun and shot myself, then I would be denying myself in the past the right to buy a gun, in a very paradoxical way. Additionally, if I gunned down any other life form, wouldn’t I be poaching on a higher authority’s territory. I am satisfied with wielding the pen and not the sword. It’s so much more rigorous for me. I like to work and be a Working Person

I would like to make an extra $500 dollars a month, so I can slowly continue to furnish my place and make other home improvements. going to try to stay under $500 dollars, though as I want to keep my disability and Medicaid. I think it will be good for me if I can find something. also weekends are my least favorite time of the week as I have nothing to do, other than laundry and grocery shopping. I think I can handle it, now that im stable on meds. so on Saturdays I will have to get a condensed workout in after my shift. wish me luck."

176146422,"I didn’t observe any events that made me think people knew my thoughts. I just experienced them being audible to everyone. It was a delusion, it wasn’t really happening. People can’t hear or know your thoughts. Coincidences are very common. If your looking out for them, they are happening all the time. I’ve found that when I’m not well I see meaning in lots of things that really have no meaning. For example once I thought that aliens were commanding me not to drink any water or there would be a natural disaster. They put me in hospital and gave me an IV drip, then there was a thunderstorm. I was distraught because I knew I had caused the thunderstorm. When I got better I realised the storm was a coincidence, I didn’t cause the storm. Nobody has access to your thoughts without you telling them what you are thinking. I know what it is like to believe that they do and I know it’s horrible. So I hope it goes away soon."

I used to NOT be in control of my mind. Now I very much of an in control of the way my limbs and my mind interact but still have some far out thoughts. Is this normal? Is it a concern to you? I could seek out sanity some more but that’d be boring. I’d rather drift aimlessly and wander just sewing and weaving together the web of life, hanging on by just the cobwebs rather than some more solid foundation. But that’s just me.

174379558,I take 1.5 mg right now as my doctor is slowly tapering seroquel xr off and slowly raising rexulti. I am currently on 150 mg of the seroquel. I can’t wait to be off it. My doc is being very slow with the taper to avoid any episodes. The rexulti is starting to help a little. No akathisia problems with it yet like the abilify. I think she also told me that slowly increasing the rexulti is better to minimize askathisia developing. Doing good so far.

176146467,"I said a lot. Not all. Maybe I should say of who I have personally met or seen because I haven’t met ALL. You’re exaggerating what I said. But go ahead and tell me that yelling at things that are invisible, striking at invisible things, saying innocent people are hurting them and they need to retaliate, or smashing thing s isn’t scary. We have the pote tial to cause fear and pretending that not one sz or sza is violent is ridiculous. I’m the first to admit I was violent in the grip of psychosis. I have attacked people. Once fairly recently. And like _PERSON_, enough have done scary things in psychosis or while delusional to make us all look bad. And again, negative things stick in the mind more than positive so even a handful of things outweighs any positive press."
176146468,"I quit antidepressants (and wasnt on an AP yet) and got very frightened and unstable. I wasnt ready yet. I also felt he wasnt ready, just being widowed less than a year ago. I doubted at the time whether i could deal with something i liked less (he is a bit blunt and not so emotionally intense/sensitive). This frightened me at the time, after coming from a relationship with a sociopath. But i know now his character is completely different…He is very loving, kind and i just need to be clear about what i want instead of giving subtle hints. In which case he is always willing to be kind. I actually like that he is very clear, honest, direct, stable, “what you see is what you get”…Which was exactly why i felt so safe."

176146479,"Dishwashing doesn’t require you to be smart or strong. You don’t even need to talk a lot. You might have to move a kinda fast sometimes though. But once you learn the system and learn where everything goes it ain’t that bad or tough. Plus in restaurants, you’re working in the back and by yourself in many restaurants. Plus a lot of restaurants have a high turnover so it means there’s usually a lot of openings. And a lot of restaurants don’t require any experience. Hell, I was a dishwasher when I was in my late twenties. I’ve seen dishwashers in their thirties."
176146480,"As my understanding goes, there isn’t a lot that can be done about negatives. But a doctor could give you perspective or even suggestions. I don’t have negatives, but other places I’ve gotten advice is in meeting groups. I don’t know if they are active right now though. As for feeling disheartened, we’ve all been there. It is a gradual process learning what limits this disease puts on you, and then a gradual climb educating yourself what you can do to deal with it. My heart goes out to you, I hope you can still find the good things to take your mind off of this."

The symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, trouble sleeping, nausea, poor balance, sensory changes, and anxiety. The problem usually begins within three days and may last for several months.

176146534,My father when he was young had panic attacks and anxiety and he started drinking alcohol as self medication. Now he is an alcoholic.
176146535,It took half a year until I relapsed. It was also bound with the situation that there was here in the house. Some drank heavily and yelled and screamed every evening. Thankfully this person left the job. Because my fathers workers live here in the house when they’re not in vacation.

176146537,Maybe switching meds might help
176146538,_AT_MENTION_ you deserve a break. You put up with so much. Just try to relax and realize that you aren’t responsible for every littlething. _PERSON_ can cope withoutyouand NEED to do so.
176146539,it’s good that you see your pdoc soon.

N then i fear im a fallen angel in prophecies of biblical stuff. It was my nightmare of _PERSON_ delusions at 21 perhaps… Yet it comes up in my mind at times still.

176146545,"Yeah, _AT_MENTION_ , I still remember that song myself, and believe it or not, it’s about 30 years old now. I really love the song she did with Tears for Fears, “Woman in Chains”, as well."
176146546,"Yes, allegedly at the wrong time and place. I dont remember but ill never take it again. Its a performance enhancer and probably does improve cognition. I took welbutrin, adderall (allegedly), straterra, and supplements. I asked for modafinil and other meds and they said no. Last doctor would only give it to me if i had a legit specialist diagnose me. My current doctor shut me down when i asked him. I figure it would save me money replacing my drinks with a 5 dollar prescription. I have aspergers and i think i got symptoms of inattentive type. I think adderall is dangerous, can cause psychosis, and worsen and give one permanent symptoms. Id only get it from a doctor but thats just me… My parallel universe / quantum brother in a past life had schizophrenia…sometimes. im trying to protect him… I think he got schizophrenia from adderall. I think he has mild adhd too, but he hasnt taken it and wont. It plays into my past life delusions. My brother gets pissed off when i talk about it. I worry abo
ut him. Hes my friend and we are close. Both me and his uncle have schizophrenia… Anyways, i think i know the cause of psychosis, bipolar or schizophrenia and how to treat it. I rather avoid the topic here. My brother suffered in a past life…a lot. Me and my whole family did…many times… I love him. Maybe ET cured him or he didnt do certain things like take adderall. Ive lived millions of different lives and was pretty much insane for most of them…i rather be sane and stick around now…"
176146547,"When you are feeling good and stable while on the medication, you feel that way because of the medication. It means the medication is working. If you stop the medication that is making you feel good, you will relapse. And every relapse takes a toll and makes recovery even harder. Uhh, doesn’t the fact that you end up psychotic and in a hospital every time you go off meds give you a big hint that something is seriously wrong?"

176146557,"Here’s my list: Take meds as directed. Follow treatment advice. Do CBT/therapy whenever it’s offered. Do workbooks if you can’t get access to the above. Make small achievable lists, nail them, make more. Try to find ways to push yourself each day. Keep a recovery journal to track your progress. Keep a positive, recovery oriented attitude. This is what worked for me and I’ve seen it work for many others. Welcome to the community!"
176146558,"I’m just me, no alters"
176146559,"Definitely depends. For instance in my case, right now it would get more n more difficult. I know cos I tried. But I think perhaps with time as I may get more adjusted to the meds and work on coping strategies, then if I reattempt with work, it may remain OK. Hard but OK. So therefore fulfilling cos its OK. Idk about your situation but the most important thing is you are giving it a shot and so won’t regret it later whichever way it goes."

176146567,I had my second session with her tonight. I was comfortable telling her about some of my delusions. She seemed a bit shocked or stunned but managed to give me some good advice on how to challenge my irrational thoughts. I asked her if CBT is effective for psychotic disorders and she said that I had good insight and it could help me. Overall I’m pleased with her so far. She is really trying.

176146580,When we complain about intrusive thoughts it is as if our own thought got the boot. Not necessarily a bad thought but a criticized thought. So we got slammed for speaking out minds like we can’t remember.

176146586,"That’s ok- practice takes time. In fact, I’ll make something as well!"
176146587,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ good to be back on!

176146588,"I’ve been in my relationship for 11 years now. It was always a matter of compromising about things, even before i got sick.

176146589,"No need to apologize dude, you’re just of two minds right now. Oh man I’d stay home and study, I can see trying to cram, and getting stressed, and getting symptoms. After a trip like that, especially if you’re busy, I’d need a day of doing nothing to rest up."

176146596,"I consider myself to be pretty rational. After my wrist injury failed to get better, my doctor said I would need to schedule a surgery to fix a tendon. My friend asked me to give him a week to see if he could fix it on his own. He stabbed me in the wrist a few times over that week, and suddenly the pain was gone! That was over a year ago. I also have struggled with insomnia my entire life. Most sleep aids are useless to me. I have tried pretty much all of them, including the schedule 1 controlled substances. The only one that sort of works is Nyquil, and it only works for three days in a row. After that, my body builds up too much of a tolerance. Lunesta has some effect, but again, not if I use it two days in a row. Acupuncture is the ONLY treatment that has been consistently effective over an extended period of time for me. I was highly skeptical of it, and didn’t expect it to work, and in fact used to tease my friend about being a professional quack. But it actually works. Not for everything, b
ut it has its uses."

174379606,I think it’s worthwhile getting a second opinion for sure. Truly it’s about symptom control anyways but we can’t answer those types of diagnostic questions.
176146611,"I become attached to people. When they travel, I become very anxious. My husband used to come home and visit during work because I was a mess while he was gone. Now, we talk every few hours on the phone. I have a very difficult time being away from my children, my parents, my sister’s family, my pastor, my best friend, and my counselor. I become very afraid. I become irrational in my thinking. I lose reason. I “cry out for help”, and it worries people."

176146628,Last time I came off the meds I was OK. Until 7 months later I rapidly deteriorated. It was a quick descent to evil voices this time. I was fortunate enough to avoid the hospital since my family noticed I was ill very early and so the crisis team looked after me on a daily basis for about a month.
176146629,Yeah it’s important to me that my doctors show compassion. You have the right to feel this way.

176146638,I still struggle with it too sometimes. It’s hard when you’ve dealt with a ton of inexplainable trauma/suffering and you have no justification for it. After all we are all maybe divine beings and we don’t wanna feel like our lives are meaningless. And they’re not meaningless. But we must search for meaning in reality. It’s hard I know I empathize with it in every way. And it’s hard to get out sometimes.

176146671,"My sz came on very slowly (over 1.5 years), and had some insight before I started taking meds. It took me five to six years to get to feel better, and 10 years and several med changes to get to feel like my old self. I still can’t handle a lot of stress, but apart from that I’m much better. I noticed that would feel better than I did six months previous, every six months. I guess for some people, myself included, it can take quite some time to feel better. I wouldn’t discount your doctor’s advise on this one, play the long game."

176146699,"I think that most spiritual lessons can be used for healing, so having mental issues doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t use them it just means that you may need to ‘get out of your own way’ sometimes when you use them. I think it’s actually for ’ helping us though the struggles’, but you have to lean into it and get through any uncomfortable parts. Like any negative things that I was holding onto made it harder for the clear truth of things to come through, the more I released and trusted the better the clarity (like pouring clean water in a dirty cup). I do a mix of different spiritual practices and meditation and it’s helped my healing greatly. I’ve had moments when I had stray weird thoughts but that’s just my head these days- so blaming the activity is like blaming the locations I’m in when I have them. I chose to give those negative thoughts no power but just look at them as something interesting and examine the truth of how I may feel about the passing thought no matter how 
odd. Sometimes the passing thought ends up being not really linked to me (like something a friend mentions later that day when I see them or someone sitting near me ). I do still have voices at times but I feel I can use any negative things they may say (which is rare now) to heal something in myself or someone I know, sometimes the message of it is abstract but always there. I’ve most often in the last year been given actual useful information and shown things that in no way I could have known, so for me I’m sure there’s a good way to work with what I’ve been given and that’s what I’ve been working on with it."

They were more realistic than a dream. I could see, hear, and touch things in this “para-reality”. I was completely surrounded by and immersed in them. The only thing I’ve read about that comes close to the realism of these experiences, is the things reported by people who have been under the influence of so-called “deliriant” drugs. See the _PERSON_ experience reports for _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and the like. The thing is, I hadn’t taken any such drug. -_NAME_."

Clonazepam seems to work on most days but no always. I think I have to take it before symptoms starts because once the intrusive thoughts start there’s no stopping them.
176146736,"You quit your meds? That’s an invitation to psychosis. For a little while people feel great, then the symptoms either creep back or hit you all at once. Sometimes far worse than before. I quit my AP shot last December. Everything was fine for about 6 months. Then all the symptoms started back. Luckily I kept enough insight to ask my pdoc for a better shot. Not everyone can do that. We’ve watched a number of members quit meds and go downhill. It’s really sad because they don’t even realize how sick they are. But you can see the difference in their posts.

From cleanliness and equipment, to medical knowledge of nurses and doctors, to being treated kindly and with respect, to informed consent (or lack thereof), to medical and social safety, etcetera. Even when a patiënt was literally nearly beaten to death staff would do nothing, not even call police, just stay in their computer room. Showers were not really cleaned, not a single time, in a 3 month stay (we tested by putting something on the ground…it stayed there). There was no psychological care at all, they didnt even have a psychologist. They failed to interfere with even the most serious side effects (nms). Doctors didnt know about withdrawal, said there wasnt any. Nurses would ridicule psychotic patients. They wanted to turn me on the streets when severely and suicidally psychotic. Just some examples.

They would likely know exactly who they’re talking to, know where their families are, know things that they shouldn’t know (all confirmed by family), no amount of medicine would get rid of their “gifts,” and, most importantly, they wouldn’t have (or ever have had) any other psychotic symptoms. No negatives, no other delusions or hallucinations, no disorganization, no cognitive symptoms, no brain damage. So, in other words, such a medium would either be a liar, or an anomaly."

I thought about asking to join, but it would have been a bad idea because of what happened to me in college from 2011. I might have died or disappeared. My psychiatrist gave me adderall at the height of my paranoia and psychosis. Plus, I think the government already experimented on me. That or grey aliens masquerading as government. I think if I got cured with schizophrenia (90%+) I would help out some way in a civilian capacity if world war 3 breaks out. I wouldn’t want to fight unless defending was essential.

174379660,"Hello again. Saw my carer at the clinic yesterday. She said i will see doc again on Tuesday. Same doc I will see so that’s good. He might start me on lyrica. I’m not so sure if this is more than somataform disorder because of my unwanted thoughts. I’m having bad unwanted thoughts so I’m either imagining these or there is another reason why I’m like this. Somataform disorder anxiety and depression are what I’m diagnosed with but the medications are not always used for these is why I’m wondering is there something more because I’m taking three different medications, quetiapine, effexor and abilify plus probably the lyrica. My physical symptoms are clumsiness and awkwardness, falling to my right side at times, racing thoughts, unwanted thoughts, conversations and focus very bad. All day getting nowhere, full and achy head. I’ve always been an anxious person and fearful. Used to have bouts of depression on and off. This past year or so has been a nightmare. I never experienced anythin
g like this. It’s strange. I feel zombie like and do believe there is an underlying neurological disorder perhaps a rare one although neurologists several of them I saw said no there is nothing neurological responsible for my illness. I am fixated on MS being the cause but I also believe I have psychiatric issues. I did think the neurologists were hiding something from me, I was very suspicious a couple of years back. Still am., which is why my neurologist sent me to psychiatrist. Definitely the abilify is shifting me a bit. I’m not taking to the bed during the day. It’s a lot of medication for somataform disorder and anxiety depression. I used to only take an antidepressant but now am on all of these. Any of you on this combination of medications for somataform disorder anxiety and depression and experiencing symptoms like mine. Thanks for your thoughts."

Moreover, he encouraged me to remain engaged and do Mathematics. He said the brain is a muscle, the more you use it, the problems of inattention will go. He is a Columbia Psychiatrist, at the top of this field. I take his word. He thinks the LDs I have are not a major problem, if they don’t bother me. And, I generally don’t care about them, too.

176146934,"I finally got the courage to ask my therapist why our sessions are only 25 minutes long. I asked her if it’s because of my insurance and she said no. She sees her other clients for the full 45 minutes long sessions. She told me that she shortens our sessions because she feels this is all that I can handle and that I don’t have a lot to talk about. She said that if I had a real problem to discuss, she would take the full 45 minutes. Honestly I think that this lady is a lame bull shitter and she is taking advantage of me because I’m probably her only psychotic client. I brought it up to my case manager and she said that I handled it well and that my therapist had a normal response. What do you guys think of the situation?"

174379699,"Because there is a lot of overlap. This is the major problem with psychiatry - its lack of objective tests to validate the clinical impressions made by psychiatrists. Without objective tests, then psychiatrists are left guessing about the threshold required to meet the criteria of a mental illness like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Sure, the DSM-5 details the hundreds of disorders and lists the symptoms and threshold requirements in order to make the diagnosis, but these are still subjective. I don’t know the stats — if they exist, but suspect that misdiagnosis is common. The criteria that determines one manic episode is vague and depends on the the story of the patient as reinterpreted by the psychiatrist. It’s an easy call for a psychiatrist, and a tough one for the patient. But do they really care? They have to fit you in according to the BOOK. The DSM bible. The truth is… they don’t really know. They don’t know why the brain does what it does and so they throw massive medical a
rtillery at it. Numb the pain, make it unpleasant, make it sound scientific. They pretend they know. But… How can you diagnose what you don’t understand? That’s the the real question. There is no misdiagnosis. There is just ignorance disguised as physical science."

176146984,I dont know if you meant that as a joke but that is the final element i have incorporated i now have the final solution. I tried a couple of different towels just a more hard cheap type of towel is best. A softer more fluffy one doesnt keep its shape well enough. So you set it up quickly with paper put in the bottom but i gather the paper in my room or somehwere not in the bathroom and then when you are ready you turn the tap on. The tap is loud. So you go quick and then you turn the tap off. Thats when you finish up with the toilet paper. I cant leave the tap going to long or it will attract attention. This is the final solution i now have it. The tap part is crucial and gives complete privacy. I use the shower for stealth as well and use the toilet when the water is heating up. Then I leave the towel on the toilet lid as a reminder and flush it a while after i have had my shower

176146987,"I didn’t necessarily mean that, I meant chemical damage/imbalance like neurotransmitters etc But there is also research showing smaller brain/bigger brain ventricles in schizophrenics. I wanted an MRI but my pdrs refused."
174379706,"Kind of a harsh statement. I mean, I’m sure the guys trying as he’s asking for help about this. My negative symptoms were bad before I tried neurofeedback, and not much was really helping. Sometimes doing nothing, while assessing the situation is the best thing to do, and I think is his best option. The negative symptoms that he has(like mine) has to do with a general boredom that he has. That is a very harsh feeling to have and just forcing yourself to do something when you know you won’t enjoy it will just make things worse. If anything, you associate the new activity being mindnumbingly dull and now you don’t even remotely want to go near doing that for a while. I think he should honestly just take it easy and see what he can do(by reading this forum for example). But I see what you mean. I do understand the get off your *** and do something advice, but you have to understand, what is nearly everything really IS boring for this guy? He has to honestly take things slow and go back to step 
1. He knows he has motivation without meds, so he could try that. But he risk having positive symptoms. 2. He could take 3mg Risperdal and a low dose of abilify(this helps him get more motivated). Now I know he had side effects(gambling, addiction, etc.) on abilify, but this was his lower dose AND he had _PERSON_ before with it, so I’m wondering how he felt with this. 3. He could try to get a new change of medicine. This may take a little while, but he also has the option to get his DNA tested with APs to see which one could work for him with a lower dose. 4. This is the closest to what you were saying-he could look to explore different things that he would want to do. Maybe he could challenge himself intellectually by learning something new or reading an interesting book(theres plenty at barnes and noble that are new and that many of you guys would like. I don’t if Canada has it, but I know the UK(which Canada is technically owned by), has an equivalent that owns them, so he could use it. He really just 
needs to do this at his sake, and honestly, when it comes to negative symptoms, I think he’s nearly incapacitated. I really thing he should do things at his own pace There are other options(like doing neurofeedback or find a stimulating investing job[This always gets me motivated because making money, especially alot in a short amount of time, just feels awesome.] I would equate it neurofeedback. But dude, negative symptoms are the worse. I would rather(in my case) ‘suffer’ from positive symptoms while feeling good, than feel bland and bored with nothing happening. Maybe I suffer for a less bad version of SZ, but I’ve always doubted it. The cops, whenever I encounter them always force me to go to the hospital(even if we were having a clear concise conversation), so my goal is to buy a house and avoid them while I get better from my physical disease(which caused OCD and I’m pretty sure SZ) right when I was starting to feel better from it. The OCD was literally when symptoms started and The “SZ”(i
t technically is, albeit mild) was right after I had an surgery that actually got rid some inflammation in my body. A few days later the SZ symptoms(most voices and ‘something’ controlling my body just started). But anyway _USER_ID_, just discover what you can do and make sure you do it at your pace. This bored and mysterious lack of energy(even though I don’t feel it, but it does kind of affect me) does suck, and I wish you the best."

176147031,"I’ll begin with a quote: Two scientists contributed to the discovery of the first virus, Tobacco mosaic virus. _PERSON_ reported in 1892 that extracts from infected leaves were still infectious after filtration through a Chamberland filter-candle. Bacteria are retained by such filters, a new world was discovered: filterable pathogens. However, _PERSON_ probably did not grasp the full meaning of his discovery. _PERSON_, in 1898, was the first to call ‘virus’, the incitant of the tobacco mosaic. He showed that the incitant was able to migrate in an agar gel, therefore being an infectious soluble agent, or a ‘contagium vivum fluidum’ and definitively not a ‘contagium fixum’ as would be a bacteria. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ brought unequal but decisive and complementary contributions to the discovery of viruses. Since then, discoveries made on Tobacco mosaic virus have stood out as milestones of virology history. = Lecoq H, So virology is only just about 120 years old and intimately linked to 
tobacco in its inception. Before that, people used to believe in demons causing illness, indeed a Chinese medical student around the same time was heard to remark “what is the difference between your idea of bacteria and viruses and ours of demons which you can’t see?”. In reality, it is a question of empiricism and observation. As always, the theory or thought inception comes first, then the phenomena is observed, yet some people claim they can see demons with their third eye or otherwise. The fact is, all creation is in our imagination, and the best way to respond is to ignore, unless you want to build on it. Building on viruses we know have anti-virals and vaccines in a never-ending war. Choose your battles wisely, I personally do not need this war, though I am not complaining. Thank you."

They say they are settinjg me up as a pedophile, by lying to bikies and others, and have proclaimed just an hour ago, that because I reacted to my tactile hallucinations in the only way that works, I am to be murdered at 0730 tomorrow. There has also been an incident with a famous Australian that they stated they are going to “stich me up with”. What should I do? Please help."

What do they sell besides carbohydrates, refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, nicotine, alcohol etc… Not to mention a lot of them have pharmacies that sell even more addictive chemicals. You gotta think about these things sometimes. Everywhere you go somebody is trying to sell you your addiction. Be safe folks…"

I had less negative symptoms on it and was able to work full time for 9 months BUT I had paranoia and occasional catatonia. The more the med blocks dopamine the more negative symptoms but the lower the positive symptoms. Also it gave me bad nausea and akathisia. I was taking Benzatropine for akathisia.

I can’t sleep without my night meds

176147063,I also worry that this started because of my boyfriend. He said he is a fallen angel and he has a crooked back like pictures of the devil have. Is it normal for men in their 40s to have that? Also one of his eyes is scarred and a story of the devil said that a saint pierced the devil’s eye so he is now blind in one eye.

176147065,"Well other people told you before, psychosis causes far more damage than medications. Would you want less or more damage?"
176147066,"A thought is defined as a natural part of the brains functional mechanisms, a part of the human experience we think therefore we are, intelligence and the depths of feeling and personality are thought to come from our innate ability to be able to function the formation of thinking, it’s supposed to be directly from the mind, many culminated synapses firing off at lighting speed a second. Most people including psychiatrists mistakenly presume that every conscience thought including the ones that are quite troubling to some suffers as a vocal entity speaking or acquiring the use of known understandable language to be able to complete the functionality of thinking, so a byproduct is a newly pronounced thought, of which was form by the use of words. Now what’s of value to think about is every time you move your arm to reach out to pick something up or walk around moving your legs, switching your glance at something in the middle distance, have you ever heard your mind or brain’s processing of pro
ducing thoughts. Or would this be a mainly silent affair? What’s termed as sub-vocalization or self-talk can be misconstrued as the thought itself, where it’s just your inner dialog of which most of us have. Another example of this would be dreaming or imagining a new idea or gaining insight into a problem or puzzle-like say math’s, Intuition is a good place to start as it’s messages are direct and emotionally clear for interpretation of the meaning, as when the penny drops it rarely announces its self out loud, so you subvocalize it afterward. So, would it be fair to say that if most actual bodily thoughts are of a nonvocalized manner either instinctive or of emotional basis how reasonably could we have a thought disorder when most are nonvocal entities? Would it be possible to recreate upon a 24/7 year campaign of harassment by hidden perpetrators, or would there be another explanation? The mind can be a puzzling thing, as impact or trauma can psychical change your brain’s functional synapses, tho
ugh other noticeable symptoms would be apparent. In short, we need to examine what is a thought, would it necessarily be of vocalized consistency, how do we use learned associations as a guide to defining the meaning of cognitive processing,(Language), and how to identify if the reading of information has become skewed. I think this might prove insightful."
176147067,He’s making fun of my sz.
176147068,I tried it for a couple weeks but my anxiety and restlessness etc A’s side effects stressed me out to much because I was so calmed by olanzapine it was a huge change in how I felt.
176147069,When I was completely bonkers psychotic in hospital I thought I was tasked with finding the ultimate question to ask and would get the ultimate answer. So I thought I figured out the ultimate question. (Which was gibberish) and the answer I got “telepathically” was “You are finite beings in an infinite world” The mind is a strange thing when it goes wrong.

176147113,"I talked with my psychiatrist about anxiety from being in cars and on rides that seemed to be a new thing with my onset of schizophrenia, but the medication he gave me didn’t seem to work, and I told him so. I think this is probably due to sensations and things being complex and the synesthesia of riding in a car and paranoia was a feeling much similar to anxiety to my expectation but in reality the drug was such a sure shot at fixing it, that it just wasn’t anxiety. Then I told him that I wanted to quit taking that medicine because it didn’t work, but as it turned out, it works well for akathesia (and I tolerated it very well already) for the drug I’m on so I ended up using it for that. The drug is called Clonazepam. I think I was told its in the family of benzos and you can become addicted to them or w/e but I didn’t take much anyway and I don’t take much now, so hopefully I won’t know what I’m meant to be addicted to, if I have to switch pills eventually.

I had people get upset at me wanting to take me out but someone is making it look like I thought these racist or perverted words, also intrusive images.

I’d like to play more often, although at the same time I don’t want to upset the manager. Before I moved here I’d play nearly every day for about 10 years or so. I was much better at playing then."

174379752,"Short answer: no. Developing schizophrenia put me on the train to med town, and medication took away my ability to get lost in thoughts and imagination as well as a good degree of emotional sensitivity, leaving me with bitterness and blankness. Schizophrenia only ever made me more agitated. The only “sensitivity” it ever gave me was an extreme one to sound. Other than that, having to be on meds for the condition pretty well carved out the extremely empathetic individual I once was. Hard to relate when you aren’t feeling a drop of emotion."

176147194,"I took the plunge on 11/4/19. 1 Mushroom Wisdom Lion’s Mane capsule daily, with the exception of yesterday. The main reason I believe that I was hesitant: The idea of increasing neuroplasticity is actually scary to me. _NAME_ seems to have changed one phrase out of a _NAME_ song. (Well, something’s lost, but, something’s gained, in living every day.) -> (Well, something’s lost, WHEN something’s gained, in living every day) I love my past training so much that I don’t want to lose many old habits and memories and such. I don’t want to encourage others to do so willy-nilly, either. I doubted that I should be taking Lion’s Mane yesterday. Then, I fumbled around for minutes at night in the dark with people watching trying to figure out how to open my trunk lid at a hotel, among other things. The car is only a few months old, but I should have learned that by now. At this point, I think I would just be too wise in my own eyes to not accept that I need additional neuroplasticity at my age 
to function in a modern world with fast changing technology. Slow, at first, though, for me. 1 Lion’s Mane tablet daily right now. It may be making me a little agitated at work, but that could be caffeine withdrawal. Anyway, I’m still employed, managed to not tell off any of my bosses or supervisors, and I still appear to be sane. Forward! _NAME_ La Lion’s Mane!"

I had a “visit” or dream a couple to few months ago that I was in this milab program called project Moon Shadow. I’m not sure if I understand or want to believe in it. It was very traumatic for me. Basically they took me or I was abducted and sent to Mars and now I’m a paranoid schizophrenic… I feel and know I’m in a time loop. I’m a little scared and nervous talking and thinking about it. No one believes me. I guess it said online there were 300 kids like me and only 1 other guy is talking about it… My parents don’t believe it and can’t handle my “delusions” anymore. They’re traumatized too. I guess they took me in college back in 2011 and then I was sent back milliseconds before they took me. Basically, there is no evidence and I’m looked at like im crazy. Very traumatic and I was left with severe dissociation and paranoia and psychosis. Started believing I lived in a compu
ter simulation and ????. Can’t remember ????. I have memory loss or amnesia. I guess some people are there for 20 years on Mars. Not sure how long I was there. I wonder if this caused my solipsism and derealization. Time travel was involved. The guy talking about it online said he was sent back to his original timeline, which is weird and crazy to me. Maybe the same thing happened to me. I’m still recovering as it has been only 8 years since I got ‘sick’. It is a sub project of mk ultra, apparently.

When in social situations though if I slow my mind down, such as to think something through or doubt or go against my old judgment they pop up again. At my last office experience the voices were absent until I became frustrated while solving a technical problem and the voices intensified I believe due to the frustration or doubt. My voices really began after a humiliating social experience. I was already depressed and vulnerable due to the depression and my anxious/paranoid personality but the experience just confirmed something I was worried about and I believe triggered a deeper depression. In the midst of that deep social-personal depression/‘defeat’ they appeared."

174379783,"Schizophrenia, psychosis, paranoia, bipolar, schizo-affective disorder, infosomatosis, these are all forms of work to say and act in the correct manner under all circumstances, resolving the contradictions of the world. Why do they say we are “benefitting”; we are struggling, trying to do the best that we can for ourselves and others. I find it insulting to say that I “benefit” in some way, I work hard to do the right thing, to maintain balance and harmony, to speak the truth. Money is important, it regulates society. I want to earn my money legitimately, both in practice and title. I cannot change the way I am, I have a condition, a real life wealth of experience in other worlds that I can’t ignore. I would like that to be recognised, not to be insulted by saying that I am cheating, but to be reimbursed officially as a contributor to society. We all make mistakes, illness is not a mistake, it is a fact of life, the absorbing of life’s difficulties, either voluntarily or involuntarily. 
To work for others is either a choice or necessity, in my case it is both. I am at once free and exploited, giving my labour as a gift and as a service. Labels are important, they can be blasphemous or a prayer, oppressive or liberating. Recognising my contribution officially would go a long way to removing the _USER_ID_, thank you."

The instructor asked us to vote music but I don’t even know the name of many artists I love so I could not vote. Too many to like although I think I rathered prince music to _NAME_’s for some reason but I love all types of music almost. Visited my sacred neigh although it was such a quick visit today I untangled her fringe that was a big knot covered in little prickly balls of some bush. I wanted to stay longer but the dogs were waiting to be taken out. I walked my brother and his wife’s dogs as they gave me that as a job which is why I feel I can afford the gym. It covers my gym fee.

176147288,Well I still have to pay for healthcare here in the United States. But I do get a lot of help. I am on disability and I have good medical insurance. I see my therapist every two weeks and my psychiatrist every month for $5 each visit. My medicine is only $4 per month. I have a part time job. I get a 4%-6% raise on disability each year (usually). With my diagnosis I’m guaranteed to get disability until I retire. (In which I’ll get retirement pay). So I can’t complain too much. I want to move to Australia. But that’s another story!

174379797,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov No evidence of associations between genetic liability for schizophrenia and development of cannabis use disorder. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, DM _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychological medicine , Dec 2019 09 Cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) is increased in patients with schizophrenia. It is important to establish if this is explained by non-causal factors, such as shared genetic vulnerability. We aimed to investigate whether the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders would predict CUD in controls, patients with schizophrenia, and patients with other psychiatric disorders.We linked nationwide Danish registers and genetic information obtained from dried neonatal bloodspots in an observational analysis. We included people with schizophrenia, other psychiatric disorders, and controls. The exposures of interest were the PRS for schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) autism spectrum 
disorder, and anorexia nervosa. The main outcome of interest was the diagnosis of CUD.The study included 88 637 individuals. PRS for schizophrenia did not predict CUD in controls [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI 0.95-1.43 per standard-deviation increase in PRS, or HR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.72-3.00 comparing highest v. remaining decile], but PRS for ADHD did (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.08-1.50 per standard-deviation increase, or HR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.27-3.22 for the highest decile of PRS). Among cases with schizophrenia, the PRS for schizophrenia was associated with CUD. While CUD was a strong predictor of schizophrenia (HR = 4.91, 95% CI 4.36-5.53), the inclusion of various PRS did not appreciably alter this association.The PRS for schizophrenia was not associated with CUD in controls or patients with other psychiatric disorders than schizophrenia. This speaks against the hypothesis that shared genetic vulnerability would explain the association between cannabis and schizophrenia."

I broke out into a scene, and heard many things that did not exist, like people from where I had been working, bombs going off, kids playing, etc. I saw my mother come and tell me “the eleventh hour is not upon us” which in fact never occurred. I saw black dots everywhere. I thought my dad was an undercover friend of mine with a mask trying to kill me. Thought everyone was looking to kill me. I had not been sleeping for six or seven days. They pink slipped me to Northwest Ohio Pscychiatric Hospital. I had been experiening much mania prior to not sleeping and during my lack of sleep. I had been thinking that I was a prophet, had been paranoid that my father was dying of cancer, was paranoid of a living situation that was volatile and left me fearing for myself and my family.

176147359,You’ll be fine 15
176147360,A lot of discoveries are accidental. Like someone mentally ill was taking some cold medicine and it helped his mental illness. So they discovered that something in a decongestant could help the mentally ill.
176147361,"I mean I understand I’m a bit incoherent at times, but I know what he’s talkin about. I’ll try and see where we meet. I just don’t want to be sittin up there stuck and no wheres to go, when it could be something in passin."

176147367,"everything, the way they act toward me make me want to hurl they are pretending to be nice sometimes and then they just turn on me"
176147368,I think there are not many beds - you have to really be very unwell sometimes to get lucky and have a treatment section… and they will try to do it cheaply first i shouted gibberish at strangers in the street…and wasn’t capable of toasting or grill toasting a piece of bread i’d eat tuna sandwiches crisps and a coke every day

And then I saw the world of beauty between the trees; The trees swayed, silently, poised- peace. A world before me, wanting me, A world of light, a world of songs. But the lights disappear in a moment, And beauty is gone in an instant; Trees fall out of poise and disorder begins. Where in this world, shall I, be wanted?"

176147385,No I definitely meant prejudiced. I hate _NAME_ for no reason other than my bad first impression. I’m definitely prejudiced.
174379807,"I still have yet to receive a diagnosis other than psychotic episode. I believe I have nearly all of the symptoms of schizophrenia (no word salad though, and one other thing), so I fear that it’s only a matter of time before the doctor diagnoses me. My hallucinations are so real and so constant and affect so many aspects of my life and I’m losing my sense of reality. I used to be able to say with 100% certainty that it was all in my head, but as time goes on and the hallucinations develop more and become more intense and intrusive, that certainty is beginning to waiver and I’m not so sure it is in my head. I am starting to wonder if maybe I do have a telepathic connection to these people and maybe there actually are hidden cameras all over my house, and maybe I’m not mentally ill after all…but, I realize that is probably just a part of the disease as it progresses and develops. I also wonder if I might be schizoaffective (is that the one with bipolar?) or maybe I’m just bipolar with psy
chotic episodes…I really need a good, competent doctor to help me figure this out. But, I’m on medi-cal and the quality of care isn’t exactly great. So far, I’m on my third psychiatrist since the voices started. However, I’ve only been completely honest and open with this most recent. A previous psych diagnosed me with complex ptsd, but those delusions I think were directly related to the sexual assault I experienced. It’s all very frustrating because I just want to know what is wrong with me so that i can get better and work my way out of this as best as I can and maybe regain a sense of normalcy in my life."

174379818,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Social interaction skills and depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with schizophrenia: The mediating role of auditory hallucinations. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, International journal of mental health nursing , Aug 21 2019 Past studies have presented evidence that depressive symptoms are affected in different ways by social interaction skills and auditory hallucinatory symptoms in people with schizophrenia. However, few studies have focused on examining the relationship among auditory hallucinatory severity, social interaction skills, and depressive symptoms. This study aimed to explore the mediating effect of auditory hallucinatory severity on social interaction skills and depressive symptoms in people with long-term schizophrenia. We propose that auditory hallucination severity functions as a mechanism through which impaired social interaction skills increase depressive symptoms. In this study, a convenience sample of 186 people with schizophrenia was obtained from hospit
al-based rehabilitation wards. Four instruments were used: A demographic data questionnaire, the Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills-Chinese version, the Characteristics of Auditory Hallucinations Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory II. To investigate the mediating effect of auditory hallucinatory severity after controlling for six covariates, we tested an indirect effect in a simple mediation model using the SPSS macro PROCESS, which is a regression-based approach. The indirect effect and the results of _PERSON_ test were significant (Z = -2.824, P = 0.005), which confirms that auditory hallucination severity mediates social interaction skills and depressive symptoms. This finding suggests that psychiatric nurses must teach people with schizophrenia to use auditory hallucination management strategies to prevent them from becoming immersed in auditory hallucinations and reducing their social interaction with the real world, so that depressive symptoms can be improved."

There is only writing and reason and rhythm and patterns. Actually it is math. In fact the humanities, the history, is as important as the stigmas being erased. The hatred being unseen. We need to learn from our mistakes. In the end it all just circulates in a perfect lilt. Make it perfect. Make it power. Make it pictures. Images on camera. Or images in your mind. Really it all goes away with time. Naturally. Actually. I think our ancestors would approve somewhat. I just hope we approve a bit more…you see. Society is like a tidal wave.

That takes time and treatment and varies from person to person. For me I always reality check by saying “would I have believed this before I got sz, back in my twenties and earlier?” If the answer is no then I usually attribute it to the disorder."
176147425,"I also worry about this, but I don’t fear an early death and I know that 35 is still young. I’m telling myself “you’re too young to even worry about it.” Not sure how much longer that’s gonna be true for though. Back in my twenties I never gave it a second thought. There’s a commercial for something where a guy goes to his buddy, “this is you… worry worry worry worry worry worry dead. This is me… happy happy happy happy happy happy dead. See the difference?” That made me think about things a lot more. What I don’t buy is the line “death gives life meaning.” In my opinion, death is not necessary to give life meaning. You can enjoy something without facing the threat of it being taken away. I hope you can get past it. It affects every single other person, if that makes you feel any better."

She was also asking what I liked about him and what he likes about me. Then she said do you think it’s possible you also have it ? I said I have no idea. I don’t know that much about it. Is it possible ? She said yes it’s a possibility. And that might also why we get along so well and gel together. Now I’m not sure what to think. I don’t know where to go with this.

176147438,I quit watching Porn and it’s been more than 2 months since I did anything sexual. I realized that was exposed to porn at a very young age and was sexually abused a lot as well hence I became addicted to Porn for so long. Even though I was watching it once or twice a week I had been doing that for more than 20 years and now I’m 34 turning 35. It was damaging my brain and my sexuality. I’m coming to terms with the horrific abuse I went through as a child at the hands of some evil people and have been writing down my thoughts in a diary. I’m still healing from all the abuse and have flashbacks about it but I believed quitting Porn is a step in the positive direction. I’m proud of myself and hopefully my mind and body heal from all the past traumas.

I had to get it once every two weeks and I had school to worry about. I ended up relapsing 3-4 months later after only having the pills in my system and that called for a new pdoc that threatened me that if I didn’t take zyprexa, he’d commit me. I had to take that until he left his job and I got a new pdoc and she saw what rough shape I was in after 2-3 apts.

What does disassociate mean? disassociate(Verb) To separate oneself from a person or situation.

Second, many folks suffer from religious delusions. It is one of the top three topics of delusion, alongside aliens and government conspiracies. We don’t allow discussions on those topics, either.

Stay on your med’s so you can show your pdoc you’re being responsible. Your pdoc will be more likely to work with you then."

176147560,Weed just became legal in my state and there’s no shortage of high grade stuff around. So I was out fishing with my uncle and he talked me into smoking some weed. Let me go back a bit to when I use to smoke every day. From my late teens until my early 20 I smoked every day. For 4 years I was high from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep. I couldn’t function without the stuff. I was dependent on it until I got severe psychosis. I got paranoid as hell after smoking with my uncle but I was able to talk myself out of the paranoia. After that it just made me hungry and tired. Now that it’s legal in my state I figured I’d give it a shot. I have no plan on making a habit out of it. I didn’t enjoy it. Smoking the other day for the first time in 15 years gave me insight into my addiction to the stuff. Now I know why I needed it all the time way back then. Smoking weed heightened my senses touch smell taste and it dulled my pain. Back in the day when I smoked all the time I couldn’t 
get any enjoyment out of life unless I was high. Looking back In retrospect everything was dull when I wasn’t high. I couldn’t get enjoyment out of anything unless I was high because I became use to the way it heightened my senses. I remember when I got out of the hospital because of psychosis I had not smoked weed in 12 months. I had to relearn how to enjoy life without being high. But it felt good to get enjoyment in life without it. It was the most at peace I felt in a very long time. My uncle left the rest of the weed in my tackle box and I flushed it down the toilet. I can enjoy life without getting high.

Patients were stratified according to number of suicide attempts, number of hospitalizations, employment status, and TRS onset time frame.Of the 408 patients with TRS described by psychiatrists, 37.5% had ?1 suicide attempt, 78.9% had ?2 hospitalizations, 74.5% were unemployed, 45.0% had TRS onset within 5 years of first treatment (a further 8.0% had TRS from first treatment), and 31.5% had TRS onset after 5 years (15.5% unknown). Patients with ?1 (vs 0) suicide attempts had statistically significantly more psychi
atric (3.6 vs 2.2) and physical (2.2 vs 1.6) comorbidities. Patients with ?2 (vs ?1) hospitalizations were statistically significantly more likely to have hallucinations, conceptual disorganization, social withdrawal, and cognitive dysfunction, and had more psychiatric (3.0 vs 1.9) and physical (2.0 vs 1.1) comorbidities. Unemployed (vs employed) patients were statistically significantly more likely to have delusions, hallucinations, blunted affect, social withdrawal, and cognitive dysfunction, and had more psychiatric (2.9 vs 2.3) and physical (2.1 vs 1.2) comorbidities. Patients with TRS onset ?5 (vs >5) years were statistically significantly younger (35.0 vs 43.7 years), less likely to have hallucinations and social withdrawal, and had fewer psychiatric (2.6 vs 3.3) and physical (1.7 vs 2.3) comorbidities.Greater clinical burden in TRS is associated with greater illness severity and chronicity markers, suggesting a dimensional gradient from non-TRS to mild-moderate and more severe forms of TRS. Time to ons
et of TRS may have implications for outcomes, with data indicating greater burden in those with late-onset TRS. Accumulation of illness over time may be more important than time to onset."
176147562,Last night had a semi catatonic episode. My husband was confused why I didn’t talk. He wanted me to read to him but i couldn’t. An hour later I came out of it. A few hours after that my mood shot up and I felt like dancing. Felt so good. Went to bed 2am - reluctantly. This morning I crashed again. And again my husband is confused. Doesn’t understand. He thinks the depression only is supposed to come when I’m premenstrual but now I’m not. I don’t know why I feel so empty inside. Like I’m hollow inside like an empty house. It keeps on coming back… Yesterday Alien tried to control my mind but fortunately today he’s quiet. At least that’s good but I hope I don’t speak too soon. I want to hide away forever.

I was always a quiet, shy boy. Maybe it’s just one thing and has always been one thing: schizophrenia. I got a very bad stomach virus when I was a kid. That’s when I started noticing certain things changing…like maybe more bullying and more isolation and possibly more dissociation. My father abused me somewhat, but is a good, loving person. Is it possible my schizophrenia was caused by the Norovirus? I don’t know. Been having some strange dreams lately. Some might consider them nightmares or sleep paralysis. Yes, I got a lot of 
problems lol. I think the glutamate hypothesis is more of a concern for me than the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia.

176147617,The curve is not flattening anywhere! there Is so much misinformation out there. Your dad is wrong _AT_MENTION_. No offense. Stick to what the doctors say!
176147618,What ap were you on when you are 96kg
176147619,Does your’s wife has MI?It’s sad if she’s leaving you because of something you can’t change.Maybe there’s still a chance you can work out together in therapist’s office.
176147620,hope it becomes clear to you
176147621,"Does anyone know what the interactions between Haldol 4mg, Adderall 30xr, and Ephedrine 25mg (Ephedrine dose taken 2-8 times a day) Should probably note- Ephedrine is not prescribed. I have an eating disorder and use it to suppress my appetite. The Adderall is prescribed. I know all of these medications work via changes in dopamine, but do they actually impact each other?"
176147622,Maybe you should try “erotica” instead of porn.
176147623,"I had a friend who I used to chat with on Facebook, at some point in my life I was delusional and thought he was my twin flame. I told some of my friends that I liked him even though he had a girlfriend. We were in the same group at uni but I was too delusional to really be friends or anything else in real life. During my psychotic break, I had a command hallucination that told me to tell him I fing loved him, he didn’t care and that he should get the f out of my life. He told me that it wasn’t him it was probably someone else and atm I didn’t care, but after meds I felt guilt because I did enjoy just being friends on Facebook. I used to get haunted by the thought of meeting again irl but now I’m over it. With time you’re gonna accept the “sins” of the illness and move on."
176147624,Are aps usually stop working on all patient by time. Or its just a small posibility. ?s there any percentage for this? What is the chance for one patient of stop working?
176147625,The Vraylar could be activating and make you agitated possibly
176147626,WTH does that mean!?!?!?
174379875,Seroquel gave me realistic and horrific nightmares. I eventually came off it. I’m now on abilify but if I don’t take it at more or less the same time everyday then I get vivid dreams.
176147627,"lunesta, let me research that."
176147628,I just feel people don’t understand me.
176147629,Do you know what’s making you feel this way? Maybe stress? Loneliness?
174379874,"Thank you!! The only segue I forgot to make was including the info on how men have a worse prognosis than women. The concept of ‘making meaning’ was spoken of at an extra curricular business type function(sure he was a ‘consultant’). Lol. His example was merely making eye contact and speaking to us. But there are a myriad of examples too. On the cynical side I think people are perpetually negotiating, but maybe that’s because ‘play’ dried up from my lifestyle before work did. Thanks for the support!!"
176147630,Same I’ve been denied three times and this is attempt number 4. I don’t have my hopes up.
176147631,Can’t remember what you went into a room for.

176147633,"I say just do it. Try to remember that she’s a doctor and has talked to all kinds of people about all kinds of things. I know it might feel uncomfortable, but if the alternative is not getting what you need, I think it’s worth the temporary discomfort."
176147634,"I know what you mean though I’ve never heard voices. The better we get, the closer we come to living the “normie” life which is usually, boring, mundane and trivial. BUT…I’m willing to risk a boring life rather than deal with delusions every day. I know that being delusional and psychotic was not fun or pleasant even for a minute. It was 2 1/2 years of hell and suffering and now, being bored is a privilege. I love not being delusional. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to my meeting with God, we were right in the middle of plotting what mankind should do next."
176147635,Not necessarily
176147636,"Im gonna post it…when I have figured that out!!! It seems complicated, wether or not people are more emotional with that… just information"

174379869,I’m a writer and an artist but I struggle to work on most days due to avolition. Haven’t published my book yet or sold any paintings due to lack of motivation. I wish I could have that spark! But I do manage to help my husband with his business tasks (payments and statements etc). Don’t enjoy that much though. Wish I could just get off the ground with my art and books! Got two books I finished about my journey with sza and my journey to Islam. And a third book I’ve started about veganism. And I have poems as well which i want to compile into an anthology.
176147637,I take Seroquel 100 mg every night and Trazodone 50 mg every night. These are prescription psych meds. I also take Melatonin 6 mg every night. That is over the counter. These are wonderful at helping me to sleep. I take them all at around 9 pm and I’m out by 11 pm.
176147638,"Government usually can give you a shelter stipend, like a few hundred bucks for partial rent."
176147639,I panicked taking my meds today thinking I was doing it wrong. But I took them anyway. I also feel like everyone on here knows my real name and info and someone’s going to come after me. It’s been intense all day
176147640,i decided to stay awake
176147641,"I don’t understand it myself. I went in there to be treated for depression, but then it became a drawn-out battle to get the right medication for my so-called sz."
176147642,"No I’ll be damned and fight with all my might to not have my brain cause me to do all these things. I just can’t walk for a bit. _AT_MENTION_ made me realize it’s the AD. It made everything worse from the gecko, now I’m off it and have to let my brain heal. God bless that mans soul"
176147643,"It all feels exactly real. I can’t just will my way out of the belief and very real experiences, I can only fix my brain physically to stop it."
176147644,"Hard same, buddy."
176147645,"I’m getting my eating under control finally. Today should mark the fourth day in a row of staying within my daily calorie allotment. I’m aiming for 1,500 kcals on days off and upwards of 2,000 calories on work days and I’ll only go lower once I plateau. Currently I’m 180 pounds and my goal is 135-140 (which will be slender for me as I’m 5’8""). Good luck everybody!"
176147646,No more negatives. I might still need my antidepressant.
176147647,Very clever. I love pumpkin pie. One of the tastiest desserts to come out of America.
176147648,"I think I did the worse things here, I injured my brother with a knife while psychotic. I was sure that he was stealing my energy and was causing my sz telepathically by being alive."
174379877,"Mainly negative symptoms like lack of emotion, motivation, speech, and interests. But I still have a fair amount of paranoia and delusional thinking, though ever since increasing my risperdal dosage, it’s been mostly in check. It was real bad there for a couple of months. I also still struggle mightily with OCD symptoms like intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors."

176147650,"I also have Lazarus ideation. I used to think I was Jesus, but maybe I’m Lazarus, because of my illnesses. Perhaps it’s bad karma, that does it to us, or bad decisions, or just the illness. Or maybe God is using us for his art."
176147651,Please tell your psychiatrist that you have suicidal ideation. It could be caused by your meds even.
176147653,I have a group of Sz friends who live in China. Most of them have a full time job. Half of them really struggle to hold their job due to low energy and a foggy mind. But a few of them performed pretty well at their workplace especially one woman who does a translation job at an IT related company. She earns good money and very happy. This woman’s success inspired me to pursue my goal.
176147654,I have a college diploma in Automotive mechanics and a first year certificate (college) in heavy equipment mechanics. I use the knowledge at home but don’t work in the mechanic field which makes it feel sometimes like it was a waste. I’ve also been in school for autonomy but dropped out cause I was pretty sick mentally. And went to school for early childhood education but lost interest in the first semester. Then dropped out. For anybody who hasn’t gone to school yet I suggest you aim high. Albeit people might think your grandiose but at the same time alot of people consider a college education second class. Which could also make people think negatively to you.
176147655,i disagree but i accept your view.
176147656,I have experienced this.
176147657,My voices have been going on all day. I tell them to ????.

176147660,"I gained weight on invega. But I have also lost weight on invega. It doesn’t make you break the laws of physics, if you take in less calories then you burn you will lose weight. However it makes you burn less calories, and apparently makes you like carbs. That’s what one nurse told me when I first started taking it, and I said I smoked weed everyday and ate a ton of carbs when I had the munchies and never gained any weight. So basically it slows your metabolism down and probably does some other sciency things that I don’t understand."
176147661,Yes. Better than nothing. I’m soon to be 50 and I’m fitter and mentally better than 30. Don’t wake up thinking I could have made a difference now…I wish I found out that exercise can help way back then at 30. It really can help…
176147662,I’d listen to the pharmacy. It’s also on the web. Just be assertive with your doctor and tell them that.
176147663,Thanks for the reply. I will try to think of it as prioritizing my health.
176147664,I am hungry but my anxiety is so high I think I might throw up if I try to eat.
176147665,Especially when visiting a surgeon.
176147666,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_! It’s a few years old, but I remember looking at pics of birds for help on the legs… I can never get those right, haha."
176147667,What kind of diet are you on _AT_MENTION_ ?
176147668,"welcome to the forum, love your profile name positive symptom means hallucinations and delusions and paranoia negative symptom is like what is lacking like motivation, speaking, energy, confidence etc."
176147669,"I focus on my brain like this since ten years tbh… Do you think its a delusion? Or more of a somatic thing? yeah, i am dumb … Maybe the zyprexa will stop this even if its after years? i am glad you are better now though, really"

176147674,"I was on gabapentin for a very short time. I forget why I got off it, but it was kind of tough coming off that drug. I was suffering more than I cared to. It only lasted a day, though."
176147675,That would ???? me up too.
174379883,Not a substitute it’s not an either or Without medication half of us would already be homeless the rest in hospital Meds or insanity is the choice If you have schizophrenia and want to go back to the worst of your psychosis and have no guarantee of coming back stop taking meds
176147676,"Hey, I never ask my sister’s for money or to buy me anything, but when they buy me a jacket or a necessity for the kitchen like a new frying pan, I know they do it because they care for me. They buy me stuff because I’ve been livng under the poverty line my whole life and they have good jobs and make good money and we’re family, and they don’t want to see me go without. They enjoy my company and when they go to a concert or play they don’t want me to miss out because I have no money. I also know it makes them feel good to help me. Maybe it’s the same situation in your family."

174379889,"The thing is we have schizophrenia or sza. You are trying to “join forces” will people who are ill all the while stating you are not. How do you think that comes off? What effect do you think you are having? What are you trying to accomplish? What’s your end game? Are you trying to turn us against our diagnosis? We accept we are ill. We’ve gotten past this part in our illness. You’ve only just begun your journey,"
176147679,I lost 18-20 pounds in about 7 weeks.
176147680,Have you taken to a psychiatrist ? It’s all about function for mental illness. If something isn’t normal you need to investigate. I’d recommend getting to a gp to referral to a psychiatrist. Especially if your son is not doing well with life.
176147681,You’re in a sustained state of psychosis. You will likely decline from here. What’s your diet like?
176147682,I wanted to hike to california
174379891,I think according to the article in this post Cognitive decline happens with or without meds. But as psychosis fries your brain I imagine (just my opinion) that it’s worse without meds.
174379881,"So,we ask now about the existence cause AND the functional cause of the sz We have 2 different questions; In the case if the sz is an organic disease in root origin 1- what are the abnormal chemical substance and the functional changes that occur in the biological nature and create the symptoms of the condition be called sz ? 2- in the case,if the sz is not an organic disease in root origin The existence cause , must be an external cause ( is not a part from the genetic material) So,what are the functional changes that the sz’s pathogen introduces in the basic nature of the human host nature and cause the diagnosed symptoms ? In the research,they said 1-“if we can find out what dysfunctional,then we can figure out how to fix it "" 2- "" the trillions of microbes that we carry in the gut produce the vast bulk of the same neuro-transmitters that are used for regulation of the brain 3-” the hypothesis of the study is that gut microbes are a key factor in the psychological changes in the brain As 
we see,they remain belief in physical cause (self-origin), because the trillions of microbes in the gut is considering a part from the human inherited nature ,specially the gut’s microbes produce the same transmitters (D,S, G…etc) ,therefore they are not an external factor for sz even if they do not located in the brain While I say that ; There is NO any physical cause (self-origin) located in anywhere in the human body structure AT ALL ,or organic genetic disease ,and there is no any abnormal chemical substance (transmitters) released in the brain ,and there is NO functional mechanisms directed by the Human Genes to producing the diagnosed symptoms , Because the existence cause of the sz condition is External cause,factor or pathogen that is not a part from the human body structure ,and it acts as a functional cause producing the changes (an alteration in the cognitive material) in the content of the mental concept of any knowledge process be treated mentally By the way,genes operate under unified and in
tegrated system ( Genome),so do the brain neurons throughout communication network, While microbe acts alone (there is no collective participation between microbes to achieve a specific goal ),so how you can explain the mechanisms of producing a group of symptoms,specially each microbe does the same thing that trillions of microbes do (single microbe does what it does independently /isolated from the participation of other microbes )"

176147685,"Thank you ALL for your support, concern, compassion, care, fact-based language, patience, persistence, and determination! The night went like this. After five hours in the bathroom, I received a text from my counselor inviting me to come to his office and chat. I still felt I couldn’t move. For an hour we texted, talked on the phone, and talked through the door. I finally left, but then I ran back in. When I came back out, I couldn’t find my counselor. He had given me permission to exit through a basement door, but when I went down it was locked. I texted him to say that, but I never heard back. (I found out there was no service). He didn’t receive the text, couldn’t find me, and called the cops. I waited a bit in the basement and then went back to his office. The cops met me there. They took me outside. There were four patrol cars (blocking my car and parking lot exits) and an ambulance. They put me in the ambulance and talked amongst themselves. They brought my counselor into the ambulanc
e to assess me. Even though they scoured the neighborhood and rooms in the building looking for me, they accepted that I never ran away. They also realized that I wasn’t suicidal. They sent me home.

176147690,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ that means a lot

Didn’t have a primary doctor and didn’t find out until it was too late to treat. My grandmother lived until 94. My great uncle is still alive at 84. My grandfather recently died and he was 87. I just hope I live about as long as my wife. I don’t know what she would do without me. I have this book from the military that outlines all the stuff she has to do when I die about benefits, retirement and life insurance and stuff and she wouldn’t take it. Only I know where it is."

Then I mostly had an apartment from 2004 to 2016 and had to leave again. Have had periods of homelessness and housing since."

176147698,I had a relapse when switched from risperidone to ability and we went into a hard lockdown and tabacco was banned. Pdoc said quitting is stressful and more so for schizophrenic but can’t cause relapse. They actually use lower doses on non smoker than smokers and cut doses by 50percent usually after you quit smoking. I started smoking again when relapsed. Chantix can cause psychosis my psychiatrist won’t prescribe that for me.

I found it more addictive because I wasn’t vaping for 5 minutes each time I had to because of the nicotine. I sometimes vaped for one and a half hour until the battery gots empty non stop, I just stood up to get myself more to drink. But honestly I enjoyed vaping a lot. Then I got scared because I’ve seen what an explosion of an vaping device looks like. On the other side I had to drive downtown to get coils and liquid, and for smoking I can get everything here in the village. I somehow don’t care much about the health either vaping or smoking."

So I was a real pain in the ass for everybody"
176147706,"Hmmmm… I wouldn’t go so far as to say we need a collective of “practicing schizophrenics”. I meant that mental illness is highly marginalized in most societies, and that it can be difficult with the duality of diagnosis and maintaining societal expectations in a world that is leery of us at best. Absolutely agree. They wouldn’t be hallucinations anymore-- they’d be shared experiences at that point. The word “hallucination” itself denounces the experiential validity of such an occurrence. Interesting. I suppose there is some pessimism with that view for sure. But as history shows us, true inclusivity takes a while-- if it even happens at all."
176147707,I’m glad you controlled your anger. That’s great! Hopefully this becomes the norm for you where you can think your way through things and not blow up

176147731,Which dose and ap are you on.
176147732,Thanks I feel better… Did you get the vaccination?? Or…
174379901,When I was on an extremely low dose of risperidone four years ago I had the motivation to leave my house everyday but unfortunately I experienced lots of positive symptoms like extreme paranoia. But yes antipsychotics contribute to the anhedonia and avolition that I experience. I do however think that my illness also is a factor.
176147733,Feel the same
176147734,I haven’t really smiled in 5 years. It wears on the soul.
176147735,"I was feeling a bit anxious yesterday so I decided to take a small amount of Klonopin. It was generic brand Clonazepam, usually I take the brand name. This morning I woke up to a sore throat and sore leg muscles, also felt hungover. I looked up these side effects and they were connected to Klonopin use. I never had these side effects on brand name Klonopin. Yeah you live and lean."
174379903,Only when if your coworkers are schizophrenic.
176147736,"Google ‘injustice collecting’, it’s a symptom."
174379899,"People ask how I managed to recover. Easy. I had access to resources. My insurance covered the best medication for me. I was able to get cognitive rehabilitation, through a study I signed up for. I was educated about mental health already because of my job, so I knew going into it what meds I never wanted to try. I came on here and learned which supplements help, and then I had the funds to buy them. I kept trying new things to see if I could get better than I was, and I have never accepted any level as “good enough to stop trying.”"
176147737,"I still have triggers that cause me paranoia like violent or horror movies/tv shows or seeing blood, ppl sick etc"
176147738,What would a mask do?
174379916,Yeah I’ve heard of aphantasia thing is this only started when I was put on invega… hopefully it comes back on abilify
174379907,"So, when I was young I did a lot of stuff for attention. I tried to get diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The doctors saw through it. Thigh I was temporarily diagnosed BPD. But I got diagnosed with psychotic depression and then Schizophrenia. Healthy people don’t fake mental illnesses for attention. Mentally ill people do. You just chose the wrong one to fake. You’re doctor’s saw through it and diagnosed you correctly. Most of us have a hard time accepting our diagnosis. It’s tough."
174379904,"Hey. I post what’s on my mind. Not every thought or feeling of course. But sometimes it’s very overwhelming. I don’t like some of the stuff I post because it makes me paranoid and sometimes I delete what I write or get paranoid and want to delete my account or anonymize it. But I’m addicted to this forum. Sometimes, I don’t get the response I want or need. I cannot please everybody or expect people to sympathize or accept some or parts of my story. There may be some honest errors in there because some of it is ‘past life’ memories, which is the paranormal part of my self. I get dreams and daylight flashbacks or recall or visions as some might call them. I might stay for a while. Like I said, I don’t enjoy what I post. Everything I post is delusional to people here – even UFOs and aliens, despite millions of people believing in it in America. Who’s the delusional one, now? I do get some support and consider some of you guys as friends and enjoy the chat. There’s a small part of 
this forum that I empathize and recognize with – especially in this thread. See, I want to have a future. Like go to school or at least work a part time job even if it’s minimum wage. I figure there are some people that don’t like me, trolls, shills, ????????, and people that reported me. My grandmother had a visit some time ago. I know what I post, but I do it to get help. I’ll never get the right help. I’m sure military type people who go to the VA have it 100x worse than me. I’ve never been in the military or real military, but I say stuff like MK-Ultra and worse to get help because I experienced something in this life and cannot remember. I have vague ideas and memories, but cannot recall stuff perfectly. It’s hard to know and who to blame. Do I blame the aliens, also? There’s so much corruption out there. It’s unfathomable. I never knew it was this bad. It’s incomprehensible. I consider myself ‘psychic’ and can see different possibilities or timelines like a quantum computer. It
s hard to describe and accept and understand to others. Part of me wants to be a math major or a computer engineer or something. I don’t want to ruin that chance and opportunity. Life is just stressful. I get paranoid after I post my experiences and life and it ruins my day to say the least. I feel like I’m being watched a lot and I hate it. I have to live my life and function the best I can. I would love to talk to someone but it’s straight to the _PERSON_. I’m tired of going there and don’t get help anyways. I don’t trust them anymore and it’s just a waste of time and resources for me. My meds are the best they’ve ever been. You cannot medicate the truth unless you literally want a lobotomy or to be unconscious. I do know I’m being watched. My life was destroyed mostly because of schizophrenia. But I think the hospital was worse than what happened to me in college. I don’t even like talking about the college. I don’t even think I like that school anymore… I have problems with my dad 
that are unrelated to this. He has no empathy and he even admits that. My mom and step-father don’t believe half of what I say because they are very Christian. My step-father doesn’t believe in aliens. My mom sort of thinks something happened to me as well as my sister – somewhat. They are more open minded. I rarely have contact with people. Perhaps, I don’t like most folks anymore. There’s some evidence and I left some notes and some stories to them if I die someday or ‘disappear’. Despite MK-Ultra being a proven program and has been documented, televised, been discussed in congress, has been admitted, and talked ad nausea, and thousands of victims talk about it, I still get flak. I still get told it’s a delusion here and from my family and from therapists and doctors. Every damn doctor or mental health worker I talk to has no feelings or empathy for me. I told them my story – even social security. I feel they’re worthless to me in some way. At least I get allowed some freedom here and so
me help and am not truly alone here. I like that. The whole system is flawed. I don’t want to sound paranoid, but you cannot trust anyone really. They never heard of it or deny it happening. Can’t even get a proper PTSD diagnosis – not that it would help me. They told me I’ll never get affirmation or acknowledgement or VALIDATION for my experiences. I get told it’s real to me, but not real to them. That’s why I feel odd and don’t trust anyone except my family. Life is very weird especially for me. Even my current doctor (county) has little empathy. I’m sure he makes $500K + a year with benefits and I get the cold treatment. He’s been a decent doctor. Sort of like Doctor House. If it wasn’t for my mom, he would be a 5 minute doctor and would be horrible. I don’t know what I would do without my parents, really. I probably would ‘doctor shop’ and get accused of Munchhausen by proxy by incompetent people and people with their nose stuck up in the air. I don’t like talking too much and 
getting into specifics. I tend to post on various websites. Not really anymore. Don’t be surprised if I delete this post."
176147739,Great idea dude!
176147740,I have hunch that the psychiatrist that said you have PTSD is incorrect…because I think your other psychiatrist is correct.
174379910,"Hi, _PERSON_!!!. I do not understand if you are injected, why you are not taking more dose by injection"

176147748,"Thank you for your insightful response, _AT_MENTION_ . Being at the weight I was meant to be is something I never considered until you suggested it. My body does indeed seem to like this weight at around 158- 160 lbs. And my BMI is still within normal at those weights. Everybody tells me I look very good at 160 lbs. I guess I should listen to them, no? And yes, I am post menopausal."

That’s like rock bottom and that’s where I was at last night. Now I got so much energy in me and I’m enjoying myself today I don’t want to lose this feeling by getting higher doses and taking my meds again

176147760,"Hi guys, So I just got the terrible news that my Pdoc passed away last week. She wasn’t feeling too well and was out of the office for a bit when I called to schedule another appointment with her. I called today to schedule something, as I’m getting low on meds, and that’s when the receptionist broke the news. Kind of in disbelief right now. I googled her name and the obituary came up and everything. My pdoc was a strong personality with a good heart, and was always very direct yet kind. She will be missed."
176147761,can i dream of zero side effects it didnt happen to me before with any doctor often i leave doctors becoz of side effects is zero side effects possible ?

176147771,We hear you and know you were hurt. I think your mom was just being immature to say something hurting you whereas she did feed you and clothe you. Maybe there will be one day in the future you will forgive her.
176147772,I feel that way but it just doesn’t pan out in reality.
176147773,"How do you guys know that it’s all a delusion? How long did it take you to realize that it is a delusion? I really believe I’m being broadcasted across the country and it all feels so real. Its really hard to tell if it’s real or not, and the only reason I dont know if it’s real or fake is because I cant find a hidden camera in my body. It’s hard to tell. And it’s hard to trust anyone who says it’s all a delusion and that’s because I hear the tv and YouTube talking negatively about me. I know I need my meds changed. Where I am, I don’t have a psychiatrist, only a nurse practitioner who prescribes my medicines. I have to figure something out because I’m feeling suicidal. This is not a good way to live. I’m only one woman and I can only take so much."
176147774,Yes but don’t make a habit out of it
176147775,"Perhaps over the next 7 or so months, we’ll find out if there are any adverse occurrences from this medication. I’m taking the ‘wait and see’ approach with this vaccine…certainly not convinced I want my teenage daughters to get this injection."
176147776,The history of psychiatry is full of failures. It really is. That doesn’t mean there’s been some learning and some really good people involved. Major tranqs and the antipsychotics work for kids like me. I’m soon to be 50 but my life has been fully evolved since taking them. In many respects I moved from observing to living and that was a profound change. Minimum wage was all I could do because I had problems. I’d be stuffed at it now because with the drugs and the negatives I never get out of first gear but I do my volunteering. It’s not a bad cop but having that and benefits keeps me sane… I honestly think it really helps to approach the system with some positivity . You concentrate on the negatives and your never going to survive. You be a bit positive and the world is so much easier to deal with…we all tread different roads till we meet at that end. Hang in there.

When I switched AP’s this year to Abilify, my mood swings went away for the most part. I wasn’t aware that I was having them until they went away. When I was originally diagnosed, my mom insisted I see a psychiatrist, and to mention my mood swings. I didn’t know what she meant, but I told the psychiatrist.

174379922,"In my head today, voices say that schizophrenia was caused by the government, starting in 1929, and it’s purpose was to target “bad people.” It says that they used psychic power to target teen angers who were partying by experimenting with drugs. This is very naive and, hopefully false. I have never done anything wrong at all. In a music classroom, in Boston, back in 2006, a group met during my songwriting class. They said that they had voted, illegally, for me to have schizophrenia later. My bad father was there. My schizophrenia started seven years later. This week, voices said that they “misfired” since I dress like a musician, and that they are sorry for listening to idiots. Before the schizophrenia began, I had no clue that any people were dumb enough to cause that. The human spectrum of IQ goes much lower than I had known. There are those with the brains of monkeys, and they will irritate a person to death, for fun, and talk endlessly inside of other people’s heads. They look like 
normal adults. My schizophrenia can mimic anyone, but those visions do not have a second location. The visions that my dad and my friends are causing are different. I can see them, at a familiar location, in the past."

174379915,I’m starting to believe that there is no such thing as schizophrenia. I think it’s a spiritual problem. I’m starting to believe that psychiatrist didn’t know what to do with it or call and made it up.

176147839,"I got out of the hospital after my initial break in 1982. I was put on medication in the hospital and took it faithfully once I got out. I became stable but in 1989 I relapsed and had several short hospitalizations; none lasting more than a few days. I went from 1990 to 2015 without a hospitalization but when my mom died in 2015 I became suicidal and ended up in the psyche ward. I guess it’s a relapse, I was in for two days and got released to a board & care home but my symptoms are at a minimum though they contribute to my problems with neighbors. But I feel OK mentally most of the time and I go to work and take care of business."

176147846,"I’m in a new trainee team of 6. My instructor is paying me more negative attention than the others. She told me and only me to pay greater efforts at paying attention after a hard day where I’d been absent-minded. A week later the instructor team sent a group email asking everyone to refrain from chatting or using phones in training. Today the instructor asked me and only me to meet with the department head to discuss my future here and whether I’m still interested in the job because “we’ve told you several times to focus”. I have some of the highest test scores in the group, fyi. She mentioned me drawing during training, but I told her I listen better if I can doodle while the instructors talk. The guy next to me chats, reads news, browses apartments and uses his phone. But nobody says ???? to him. It adds to the pile of an already shitty day. What should I do?"

176147961,Its due to blunted affect or lack of strong emotions. The way to cope this is simply start doing the first thing or first step in the task and after finishing it do the next and so on. Force yourself to start and once its get started it will be easy to go along with it.

We treated my symptoms, I don’t care about my diagnosis so more… And for my thoughts yeap. This ap calms my thoughts per moments but it smashes a bit my brain too. Its changing. My illness was by “waves” so its still changing yeap… Do you really believe that a doc will help me recover just with meds after twenty years of isolation?

I also agree that, with ocd in mind, writing these thoughts down is a good idea. If you have paranoias surrounding security of your personal computer, I would recommend writing them down on loose sheet paper and then immediately burning them. You could also write them down on toilet paper and then flush that muffukka."
174379966,"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71014-w The primary objective of this study was to evaluate how schizophrenia (SCH) spectrum disorders and applied antipsychotic (AP) treatment affect serum level of amino acids (AAs) and biogenic amines (BAs) in the early course of the disorder. We measured 21 different AAs and 10 BAs in a sample of antipsychotic (AP)-naïve first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (n = 52) at baseline, after 0.6-year as well as after 5.1-year treatment compared to control subjects (CSs, n = 37). Serum levels of metabolites were determined with AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit using flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography technique. Elevated level of taurine and reduced level of proline and alpha-aminoadipic acid (alpha-AAA) were established as metabolites with significant change in AP-naïve FEP patients compared to CSs. The following 0.6-year treatment restored these alterations. However, further continuous 5.1-year AP treatment changed the metaboli
c profile substantially. Significantly elevated levels of asparagine, glutamine, methionine, ornithine and taurine, alongside with decreased levels of aspartate, glutamate and alpha-AAA were observed in the patient group compared to CSs. These biomolecule profile alterations provide further insights into the pathophysiology of SCH spectrum disorders and broaden our understanding of the impact of AP treatment in the early stages of the disease."

174379970,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Lower folate levels in methamphetamine-induced psychosis: A cross-sectional study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and HR _PERSON_, Drug and alcohol dependence , Oct 28 2019 Folate deficiency is shown to be associated with schizophrenia. Folate profile in patients with psychosis due to stimulant use has not been investigated. We aim to determine whether there is an association between serum folate level and the presence of psychosis in patients with methamphetamine (METH) use disorder.Forty patients diagnosed with METH-use disorder were included in this cross-sectional study. Serum folate levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay technique and compared between psychotic and non-psychotic subgroups (N?=?25 and 15, respectively). We designed a logistic regression model to measure the extent of any association and also to adjust for potential confounders.We detected lower serum folate level in the psychotics [3.4 (IQR?=?5.3)] compared to non-psychotic METH users [8.9 (IQR?=?2.5)], p?
=?0.01. The model demonstrated that every 1-unit increase in serum folate decreases the odds of presence of psychosis by 27% (R2?=?53.5%, CI 12-64%, p?=?0.006). The observed difference was not associated with the duration of METH use, patient's age at first METH use, or concurrent use of other substances.Our findings suggest that low folate level in psychotic METH users does not correlate with previously established risk factors for meth-induced psychosis such as duration of use, age of onset of using, and poly-drug use. We assume that low folate levels may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of psychosis."

176148024,I don’t blame you for feeling that way. If a new drug without the side effect profile you don’t like comes along be the first in line to take it. Otherwise if you have something from the days when the illness was going on before you took the medicine that was very negative try to use it to remember why you are taking the meds.

Here’s the first song I’m going to be putting on Spotify and other streaming services, its a collaboration between me and _AT_MENTION_ (she did the lyrics) called “Plasticized” and its a hard rock song. Hope you enjoy and let me now how you like it!"

176148078,"I just switched from invega to vraylar about six weeks ago. In the mean time, I have developed some minor extrapyramidal symptoms and/or some minor tardive dyskinesia movements. My doctor is recommending to stay on Vraylar. He says that Vraylar has a lower likelihood of causing these side affects than the invega, but I have a hard time thinking it could be caused by the invega since I stopped that six weeks ago, and the symptoms became noticeable while on the Vraylar. To me, it would seem to be more logical to try switching to another AP right away, but my psychiatrist doesn’t seem to think so."
176148079,I think everyone has loved ones in a high risk group. It’s not a fact that your mother or sister will die if they get the virus. You just need to calm down a little bit.

So every two months she is starting to talk about sleep where she is dressed in a white dress before wedding or just in waiting for a holiday that means beginning of the depression. Curious, if anyone might notice signs of relapse or something. She tired of all of the relapses repeated every two months and other days may be taken away by manic episodes. We live with hope some people might found proper med to keep it all under control."
176148083,"I think he’s tired of hearing sz talk about their delusions, but that’s his job for f u c k sake. And his secretary is even worse doesn’t understand simple instructions like when I wanted a med list, she was so rude to me on the phone."
176148084,It’s a lot harder but making the effort is worth it. I got sick of being big. My bmi was in the obese category and everything was such an effort. I just plugged away at it and now I’m jogging up to 5 km’s a day and doing lots of exercise…it does get easier and it’s so worth it.
176148085,Do you know your body well enough to know when you’re manic?
176148086,It is delusional. Microphones aren’t implanted and would be unable to work if they were under the skin. That article has nothing to do with microphones or thoughts. It’s an experiment on how people may actually be speaking g their thoughts.
176148087,You’re welcome. Yeah try and give it some time unless it becomes too unbearable.

176148089,Well him being a senior administrator I thought he would understand or at least… even if he didn’t understand it’s not appropriate to show he doesn’t. I mean clearly he doesn’t know his job.

I told my mom that i needed to go to a hospital, so she called up the hospital staff and asked if we could come, they said they are full now, but there will be an open space tomorrow. Ive chosen to be treated by a young pdoc that helped me to recover from depression, she really listens to a patient and also there is UNLIMITED smoke breaks, thats the main reason I chose this hospital"

I’m more active than I’ve been in 9 months and the weight is slamming on me. I’m on a newish antipsychotic and I think that’s what’s doing it. I’ve been eating a little worse than normal. I dont want to stop my new antipsychotic because its working wonders for my symptoms and sleep, but 6 and a half pounds in two weeks is crazy!"

176148096,It’s nice to have these supportive people like her in your life!
174379990,I think this illustrates how the system really doesn’t know what is what half the time and we should do everything we can to fix ourselves and care for each other.
176148097,I have the same issue. I try to focus on something else so that the contemplation stops and starts on something else.
176148098,"Schizophrenics have poor control over their frame of mind. They give in to lusty feelings easily. So it’s there for people like that. Me included, I guess. Kind of annoying though. A healthy person with good frame control can basically turn their libido off completely unless they needed it. I’ve been able to do that before. Lust is pretty distracting."
176148099,Should I try supplements?

176148101,"I crack my neck about 12-15 times a day, some get a couple little snaps pops, but most you can see my neck move and hear it across the room. I used to crack my back a lot because of the RSD, but with my hips swollen neither lower back nor hips will pop or crack, makes walking incredibly stiff. I was advised by a few docs that did xrays and MRIs on my spine to not use a chiropractor because of worse injury. Family history, I’m gonna end up with replacement discs, probably joint replacements, etc. They wanna wait till minimum age of 45, incase it goes south and I lose all my mobility. At least my kids will be in their mid 20’s by then."

176148105,"I don’t know if it will ever be a fear of mine. _PERSON_ I’ve done shrooms… Well I don’t think that’s the reason. But rather, I used to wanna die so much. I thought about it a lot. I don’t think I fear death so much now."
176148106,"Yes, i could still work everyday and i even got to a party while psychotic the voices said someone would try to kill me there but i got there anyways."

176148112,I would love to listen but I dont have sound cloud on my phone.
176148113,I think you’re looking for things or signs that really aren’t even there and you’re using these delusions/hallucinations as coincidences. Your brain is just running a mile a minute lately.
176148114,"When I got to my second psychosis, I was given this and Olanzapine and asked to try both out Risperidone made me feel like a bag of nerves. Olanzapine just subdued me somewhat Although these at the time were low doses, and everything went to ???? many months later until I got proper treatment for SZ"

176148116,"_AT_MENTION_ , I’ve been on some form of Risperdal or another almost continuously since 1996. I’ve never had any muscle twitches like you describe. I have had intention tremors however. These go away completely with prn Cogentin which I take nightly. Cogentin may help you. You might ask your pdoc."
176148117,Thanks you _NAME_
176148118,Maybe it would help to identify your values and remind yourself of them when you’re confused about your identity.
176148119,Yeah I had this to but then with music sounding realy god enhanced and thinking I was gonna meet my perfect mate and go to the garden of _NAME_ then the voices whent from nice and supportive to saying it was all a test and not real then they started getting nasty and saying I was the weakest being for smoking cigs and weed then they took the high away some how and say iam gonna get rapped and tortured for smoking cigs which i haven’t stopped by the way for 2 years. They say iam the only being that smoked this long and give me comands like dont eat or dont take my medicine and they say iam going to eternal hell with with all the pain ever felt for smoking cigs and get eaten by dogs for masterbating. It was all fun and games thinking I was jesus till all of this I even had days when I felt complete bliss and felt like I was being taken to heaven and could here the virgin _NAME_ speak and things looked my beautiful like I was on acid but the only drug I was taking was weed I would even meditate all d
ay and the music would speak to me that I was jesus or the sun then the voices say I fell and not geting heaven but hell for smoking cigs the birds would even show me sighns at times. But what I am trying to say be careful my god voices and aliens turned out to be demons but they say that they are archons and illuminati and want to rape me. They also say that every one gets tortured after death with the average pain being 100 times worse than bullet ants so I say to you be careful and test these voices to see if they are realy from god
176148120,But they get extremely angry and threatening if I don’t want to be on meds because I believe they are external.

176148126,"Haven’t been losing weight; in fact, I think I’ve been gaining. :S It’s hard when you eat to deal with emotional pain which in this case has been brought about by distressing life events. A coworker commented on my weight gain yesterday which made me feel just amazing. /sarcasm I’m doubling down and limiting myself to ~1,500 calories a day. Gonna throw in some form of exercise every day as well. It’s just hard; I was doing so well with my weight last year after antipsychotics took it off the rails and actually became what most would call skinny again. Then stuff hit the fan and I turned to food to cope, like I always do. >_> Luckily I’m going back to therapy soon which should help. I really hope so anyway. Good luck, everyone!"
176148127,I think I need to start volunteering. I’ve been hanging with friends a lot and my school load is a lot lower this semester. I want something to fill my time. Maybe once I get disability I can start doing music lessons again
174379988,"I was on abilify for over a year. Stopped because I couldn’t sit or stay still, always moving my legs. It was simply inbearable. On a good side it had stopped my delusions. You can give it a try and see how it works for you. Everyone’s experience is different."

176148130,Was it a long time ago?
176148131,I was on invega and felt bored with life. The only thing that helped was a lot of walking to clear my mind. I’m now off the medicine and doing much better and enjoy life more.
176148132,I don’t know what kind of exam you had. Mine was brief. But I think it’s best to have the tests (scab etc) to make sure.
176148133,Call around to different pdocs (look up online for psychiatrists in your area) and simply ask them if they take original Medicare.
176148134,"I picked a major that doesn’t require GRE test scores. I had a few friends and a sister take it, and the ones who did the best had a tutor or took a prep class offered by their college.

174380004,I tried literally every antipsychotic out there over the span of a few years and finally ended up on clozapine. Ive been on it for almost 3 years now i believe. It works well. I still have breakthrough symptoms but thats life i guess…it helps level me out for sure though… I havent gained any weight from it either. Just drooling and of course it knocks you out when you take it. Im not complaining though because i have really bad insomnia and even other ap’s dont help me sleep enough. The blood drawing gets old quick but you get used to it as a routine. Its nice bc my dr will check my clozapine levels in my blood and can adjust easily. She recently had to up my dose a bit. Im on 400mg. I still have to help my valium though and vyvanse as needed along with other meds.

176148161,"The aftermath of psychosis definitely wrecked my personality for a while: Had a hard time listening to music I previously enjoyed, as it was too “suggestive” in nature.

I mentioned this to my mother and she rolled her eyes. I guess not a lot of people agree with me. Hopefully she’s crying wolf but the thing about suicide is it’s never a joke so I guess you gotta talk to her about it. I know nothing of her history. At the end of the day suicide hurts so many people and the least someone could do is just stay alive until they kick from old age. We do it, and we have schizophrenia, so what’s their excuse?"

I didnt harm myself or others. Just sat. I was put in isolation and force drugged many times. Rarely because i was suicidal, often for bizar reasons like praying quietly in a corner of the ward or peacefully climbing on a chair to look at the trees. I wasnt aggressive. Mostly just weird, which people apparently find frightening. I think there is an overuse and a lack of communication…they never explained or checked whether their violence hurt or scared me."
176148176,Maybe living in a assisted living home or renting although I don’t think I could afford to rent unless the government helped me or I might be homeless.

I did not pay rent as he owns his place but I paid half the bills and half the renovations. I was happy and content living with him.he is a great man. The main reasons we broke up /I moved out are my sacred neigh and me wanting to go vegan. I would rather live in my car and have my sacred neigh who is everything to me. Most of my money goes to my sacred neigh. I would not have a car but I have a car now because the step mum I had who I am living with now and who is the other woman that raised me gave me one and let me live with her after I moved out from my x boyfriends place. I am living in her house with her. I get my own room. She works from 7am to 9 pm and I don’t work at all but I cook

That’s not entirely uncommon for trials to have problems with high placebo response. The FDA takes that into account."

174380009,I’ll try trusting you… I’m concerned I’m not functioning as well as I think I am and that my behaviors are seen as outrageous to others while I’m none the wiser. I know people see me and feel uncomfortable. Clozaril is the only drug that worked for me. I just moved and instead of connecting myself with mental health I’ve just been hiding away. I feel too anxious to take action. Sorry if I’m coming across in a bad way btw. I don’t mean to be this way.

174380007,"# Deep Brain Stimulation ‘Promising’ in Severe Schizophrenia Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be an effective option for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), new research suggests. However, until further studies are conducted, the treatment should only be considered for the most severe cases. The first clinical trial to assess DBS in this challenging patient population included eight patients initially randomly assigned to receive electrode placement in one of two locations in the brain. Once a clinical response was achieved and participants were stabilized, they were randomly assigned to a second crossover phase. Preliminary findings from the first phase of the DBS-SCHIZO pilot study, which were reported in 2017, showed promising efficacy. The newly released final results revealed an association between DBS and significant improvements in Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) scores, as well as reductions in doses of antipsychotic medication. Moreover, the effect rever
sed when the electrode was switched off. “DBS may be a potential option for severe treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients,” lead investigator _PERSON_, MD, PhD, Department of Psychiatry, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain, said during her presentation at the 33rd European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) Congress. The meeting was held online this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new data were updated results of a study published in EBioMedicine earlier this year. _PERSON_ underlined that it is important to balance the risks and benefits of the intervention. DBS is “not useful for all phenotypes”; benefits have been seen in patients with hallucinations but not in those with a disorganized phenotype, she added. High Economic Burden Managing TRS is challenging and is associated with a high clinical and economic burden, Corripio noted. Relapse rates can reach 80%, increasing resource use by between threefold and tenfold. There is a strong rationale for studying t
he use of DBS in schizophrenia, because schizophrenia shares a neurologic basis with other neurologic and psychiatric disorders centered around the cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit, said _PERSON_. The study included eight patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia whose conditions were resistant to at least two different atypical antipsychotics and who had not responded to clozapine monotherapy, combination therapy, or electroconvulsive therapy. All were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to DBS electrode implantation in one of two locations. Investigators chose the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), because recent studies have shown that DBS can increase dopamine levels there, and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Deactivation failure in the ACC region has been observed in patients with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Stimulation began 48 to 72 hours postoperatively with unilateral left stimulation at 2.5 volts. It was increased in 0.5 volt increments to a maximum of 7.5 volt
s. Patients who did not respond were switched to bilateral stimulation. Follow-up was conducted every 2 weeks for up to 20 months. The study’s primary outcome was a symptomatic response, defined as an improvement of at least 25% on the PANSS."

176148264,"I haven’t taken it for 10 years, but I did take it for 4 years. In the beginning it worked as an antidepressant and antipsychotic (I was the weird one with paradoxical effect), but that wore out after a few days. It did stabilize my mood for a time even when I was drinking. Then it started giving me massive dyskinesia (I think thats how you spell it) and not only was I shaking but I was also slightly confused. But my memory recall was decent. I managed my symptoms for years with it until a new doctor did a DNA test on me and showed that Prolixin gave me more side effects than a few others, so I changed to invega. For now, though, I dont have insurance again and I am needing to see a doctor, so I am taking it again (without drinking anymore) and it is more effective without as much TD. I dont have much eye/ ocular problems other than myopia (chronic dry eye) and some memory problems. But no need to fret!

I’ve heard one theory of creativity that says that “remote associations” are the foundation of a lot of creativity. _PERSON_ believed that imagination is more important than intelligence. There are problems with getting your emotional gratification apart from the rest of humanity. You always have to watch out for false flights of fancy that you put too much of an emotional stake in. You can also lose touch with ordinary manners and conventions, and become eccentric. Also, no matter how great your imagination is, it takes a lot of backbreaking work to produce anything of lasting intellectual value. Writing books is hard.

I’m a weird asexual cos I can still see the appeal to sex I just don’t seem to be able to do it lol. Cos it screws me up.

I bought a good EMF meter that has shown readings that can’t be debunked as cellphone or wifi. If I show them to people they think it’s from the air Force Base.

176148364,"I am also happy and content on the pension like rogue one. It’s one of the best things to ever happen to me. I volunteer work a couple hours a week and I walk my brothers dogs three times a week. That’s enough for me. I can’t volunteer with all people because some people I can’t stand to be around. One girl I volunteer with tried bossing me about n was talking down at me she asked me to do something and I said NO and I stormed off went home and later told the manager that’s not ok. Another woman complained about the same woman so I wasn’t the only one… If I worked I would have to say yes or no and no one should boss me about without my consent in them doing so in way I approve of if I do. What would they like me to do? Would they ask and then I say yes or no? And I can’t work with most people because… Can’t. So I would work alone or choose who I can work with and if it doesn’t work out then they leave. I can’t do all jobs either. _NAME_ does comedy on YouTube and gets fan ma
il gifts. What a fun job to have and get spoiled and appreciated. If I was less shy and funnier I would do YouTube comedy and get _PERSON_’s and fan mail if I was good enough. What jobs would I even consider and how much would I be paid? I wanted to do aged care but I don’t want a boss. Just me and the client would be better or I am my bosses boss so to say so doesn’t matter. I could serve a old person beautifuly be it right person for me and I for he/she. But just one client is enough I think. No maybe another career or maybe many different careers and jobs. Realistically I’m happy to be on the pension. I couldn’t stand being bossed about and I got stressed and triggered. I went psychotic when centrelink forced me to do things. I told centrelink I’m not well enough. They said if you don’t do this housekeeping course you will not be paid. That course made me psychotic and it was too much for me. I was hospitalised because of the pressure centrelink put on me. Later I went psychotic doing aged ca
re so I had to say no to it because they were bossing me about and my body was tense beyond belief.it felt awful. I hope to stay on the pension for the rest of my life. Maybe do a little volunteer work. If I want and can and where and with whom I want and can. I avoid the bossy girl I volunteer with. I say NO to her and refuse to “take orders” from her. I told my manager how I feel and another girl felt the same about her. I’m not the only person she talks down at. I don’t long to work and I don’t miss it. I believe I could do good but finding right person , people , place , job or jobs etc is very very difficult. No normal employment agency nor disability employment agency could organise that to suit me. Maybe a independent person I employ could but they would have to be incredibly talented because it’s almost impossible for me to be happy and ok and fit in work and etc and enjoy and do good etc"

174380068,I knew there was something wrong with me but I didn’t know what. I had seen a couple doctors prior but couldn’t get a diagnoses. I was having delusions and visual hallucinations. In retrospect I started having symptoms when I was 17. It was a slow progression. First delusions then visual hallucinations then psychosis and paranoia. I quit leaving the house because I thought everyone was out to get me. Then one day when I was about 20 it was like a switch went off in my head and I started hearing voices. My mom took me to the hospital and thats when I was diagnosed. I had some insight that something wasn’t right but I didn’t know what. After spending a month in the hospital I understood I have schizophrenia. I got better and thought I didn’t need medication anymore so I had a relapse. It took 30 days after stopping my medication to have another psychosis. Again it was like a switch went off in my head. After the second time I knew there was no stopping the meds. Currently I have a lot of ins
ight into my illness although I don’t always recognize the symptoms. Sometimes people point things out or I will realize why I’m doing what I’m doing is because of my schiz. I walk a thin line between sanity and insanity. My mind plays tricks on me a lot. I don’t always trust my own perception of things around me.

176148368,My bipolar and voices were caused by 6 months of methamphetamine use. I went into a psychotic manic episode when I quit and have gone manic every 5 years since. Then the loud voices started. I never got depressed so I’m not sure it’s really bipolar.

176148382,Hello Agony. My spirit friends left because of the antipsychotic. It’s like the volume has been turned down to mute. For real life friends - I haven’t got any besides my partner and children. Don’t get me wrong - they are precious to me but it would be nice to have say 1 friend to go out and have a coffee with. Through the weekday I’m alone. I’m on an order so I must turn up for my depot otherwise child protection can remove my children. That’s what I have been told. I’m sorry you have lost custody and visitation rights. That’s what I don’t want to happen to me. Your emptiness is totally understandable and I feel for you. It would be a gutted out hollow feeling probably tinged with helplessness.
176148383,"Ok I will pray for you _AT_MENTION_ , I hope your mom and dad will be alright."
176148384,"One of my biggest regrets in life is not saying everything I wanted to say to my mom and dad before they passed away. I told them I loved them and that if it wasn’t for their help I would never have accomplished the things I’ve done. It brought a smile to my moms lips when she was in the hospital bed. And when she was in a hospice I told her more things but there was so much more that I wanted to say. So if you get to see your grandmother before she dies and she is still lucid, don’t pass up a chance to tell her how much you love her and care about her."
176148385,Same here. Since I’ve been on medication I have lost all my creativity. I’m quite sad about it but I guess it’s just one of those things that you have to sacrifice for a stable mind. Still wish I had mine back though

174380062,"ABSTRACT A recent, large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 10 twice-daily sessions of active vs sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), delivered across 5 consecutive days to schizophrenia patients with high negative symptom burden, found that active treatment was superior to sham treatment by a mean of 2.65 points on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, negative subscale (PANSS-N), at 6 weeks. This was the primary endpoint of the study. Because a difference of 2.65 PANSS-N points between the average active vs sham tDCS patient is a very small advantage, it appears that the finding was statistically but not clinically significant; why this is so is explained in the context of how the PANSS-N is scored. The study also found that, with response defined as 20% attenuation of PANSS-N scores, significantly more (40% vs 4%) active than sham group patients responded at 6 weeks. This was one of many secondary outcomes that the study examined. Because response is a clinically important 
endpoint, it appears that the finding was clinically as well as statistically significant; why this is so is also explained in the context of PANSS-N scoring. As a final poser, whereas the advantage for active tDCS for both outcomes persisted at 12 weeks, at neither 6 nor 12 weeks was active treatment superior to sham treatment on a global measure of functioning; this suggests that the advantage for active tDCS does not translate into real-life gains. The reader is provided with an understanding of how to critically read a paper that describes an RCT; of how to interpret a continuous outcome measure that describes the average patient versus a categorical outcome measure that describes a clinically important outcome in an entire group; and, most important of all, of the need to choose an outcome that is relevant to clinical practice. https://www.psychiatrist.com/_USER_ID_/article/Pages/2020/v81/20f13256.aspx"

I know the ketogenic diet, if provided in childhood, has helped people with autism before but never heard about it also helping sz, though sometimes the disorders are similar in nature.

There are thought to be many different causes of psychosis, but we dont know them all so they are all lumped in as sz."

176148515,"I struggle more and more with the voices saying incredibly terrible things to me day and night. One of my coping tools is to do some exercise each day, in order to release held back feelings I get from having to deal with the voices/entities. I am called selfish for exercising and they also send me terrible dreams that are associated with exercise and being a bad person for doing so. I know eating well and exercising is not bad, but it is a challenge to continue to have to put up with what these voices/entities are doing to me.

174380087,"Yes, but it really depends on the nature of the problems that emerge. In my experience, treating psychosis and/or mania is a lot easier than to treat depression. So if the depression got worse from quitting clozapine, it may indeed be hard to get back to the same level. But it’s not likely clozapine has any prominent antidepressant effect; for that purpose, there are several other antipsychotics that are more suitable; some of them even have approval for that indication. I initially agreed to try it because it is a drug with unique effects and one of the antipsychotics most likely to improve negative symptoms. I guess I am naturally adventurous when it comes to drugs and medications. That is largely because of my fortunate experiences, such as being able to quit paroxetine (Seroxat) and sertraline (Zoloft) without withdrawal effects. -A."

174380108,"_AT_MENTION_ Thanks for sharing. Majority of schizophrenics on this forum are men and I guess most of them settle with pornography. But I actually prefer the actual five senses (sight, sound, smell & touch except taste) when in close proximity of a woman. I miss the reciprocal touch and feelings me and a former girlfriend had which really sucks. But anyways, from my experience is that we schizophrenics have to find a normal person who will accept us because finding another schizophrenic of the opposite gender within a 5 mile radius is rare. Forum users here are scattered around the world."

What helped you? Did they go away? I am counting on myself now tbh, but its scary to be alone in this lol… I know believe, that I should ‘‘arrange’’ my thinking in order to be free of this… Basically I work on my thinking, yeap, and doing some activities when I can.

174380132,"Tropisetron, a commonly used medicine against nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and surgical anesthesia, is also a high-affinity partial agonist of the nAChR. Previous study demonstrated that tropisetron significantly improved overall cognitive deficits and P50 inhibition defects after 10 days of treatment. Cool. After one day of treatment, the total RBANS scores of the 20 mg and 5 mg tropisetron groups, and the immediate memory of the 10 mg group were significantly higher than placebo group. The P50 ratio was smaller in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups than in the placebo group after treatment. Furthermore, the improvement in RBANS total score was correlated with increased S1 latency, and the increase in immediate memory score was correlated with decreased S2 amplitude. One day of treatment with tropisetron improved both cognitive and P50 inhibition deficits, suggesting that longer term treatment with ?7 nAChR agonists for these deficits in SCZ may be promising."

174380125,"Oh btw I’m on an injection called Aristada. I tried a lot of other pills, they didn’t work for my symptoms. Not sure if pills actually correlate with symptoms or if it’s all just individual preference so I’m not telling you this will for sure work for you. Aristada is the monthly time release injection of the pill Abilify, generic name Aripraprozale or something like that. I found the injection overall more convenient but I think you’ll wanna try the pills first if you in fact try meds. The dx of sz will go into your medical records and it’s permanent just a warning that nobody told me. This basically means you go to mental health pod in the event you end up in jail, various other consequences but overall not a bad thing. It’s just a label. So if you’re honest with the docs they will dx you (diagnose), and if you are incarcerated they will forcibly medicate you. This I learned the hard way. All antipsychotic meds (scary name I know) cause weight gain in my experience, some less than 
others. Your ‘killer instinct’ may fade, I know, sad. Abilify will make you jittery at first probably but this diminishes over time. You’ll be nervous about the meds and exaggerate their side effects and stuff like that probably. Coming off of them is very hard, this is like a lifelong thing. (Stuff people didn’t tell me). But it does improve the overall quality of life. One day maybe you’ll look back on your old self with a mix of pride, shame, and pity…or maybe not idk but that’s what I do."

176148667,Responses should show up as a numbered marker beside your Avatar…again in the top right corner of the page. Strange you aren’t getting any notification markers.
176148668,"You dont deserve punishment, especially one so harsh as cutting yourself. Would you tell a friend that they deserve to cut themselves if they did what you did? I wouldnt, so why dont you deserve the same compassion you would show a friend? I’m just over a year of being cut free, and I know how strong the urges can be, but you deserve so much more than cutting yourself."
176148669,2 years later. I didn’t realize I had doubled my Wellbutrin in the last two years. Oh well I am better on 300 mg than 150 then. At some point I was having headaches and my doctor wanted to take me off of Wellbutrin. Maybe that was around that time. It all runs together.
176148670,I’ve thought of it as both biological and a bit of a spiritual mess up. Like in the sense that my beliefs in my mind have been twisted up. Not in a religious sense though.
174380137,"If you have Sz or SzA… I wondered if you always need meds when you go through episodes of psychosis or do they sometimes resolve like ebbs and flows which get worse but eventually get better? I am a little confused. Probably overthinking. I recently had a few weeks where delusions got worse and then really bad. Was terrified for days at one point . A lot of visual hallucinations, tactile, and intrusive visions. But these have all begun getting better through time without med increases. With a lot of support from my nurse and hubby. I am still having them but not as bad at all. And my thinking is getting better. The reason I am asking is because I was diagnosed with bipolar, schizotypal, and anxiety a couple of years ago. But my nurse has said things like ,‘thats what happens with schizoaffective’ a few times (and things like that about schizoaffective) a few times. I once confronted her and she said not to focus on diagnosis and I don’t necessarily have that. But again said it just recently
. A lot of symptoms don’t match my past previous diagnosis so i don’t know what to think. Sorry this is long. If you could answer my question that would be appreciated."
174380131,Risperdal works best for me.
176148671,I think there misinformed. I read somewhere that it can cause fatty liver.
176148672,I never found any although the ones in the hospital freaked me out because I could see them. And I know they had them in the bathroom too but I could never find that one. I just think it’s my cell phone now. They are always watching and listening.

176148674,"Oh, that sounds nice. When I was suicidal, I really liked mood music and I liked suicidal, hard rock. Anything to intensify my suicidal feelings. Now that I am of a happy, content, even mood, I like all music or no music but, I prefer not to listen to really sad music now."

174380135,"that is interesting, thanks for sharing"
174380139,It did for me. So I think your doctor is being a bit pessimistic. There’s a med combo out there for you. Maybe even Clozapine at the end of the day. But don’t give up hope just because abilify isn’t the one for you.

176148686,"Zoloft worked really well, a little too well for me, I went manic and ended up in the hospital. I was at 200 mgs. I would definitely want to take it again at lower doses because it’s a great anti-depressant. But once you go manic on one they don’t give it to you again, at least my pdoc won’t, she moves it to the “tried and failed” list. For me that’s a long list lol."
174380140,"I’m on Abilify Maintena 400 also, every 3 weeks. I’ve just noticed a shorter attention span…unable to watch full movies or read long text. Or perhaps I was always a bit like that…just a bit."
176148687,"Hang in there girl. Talk to someone, even if it’s the crisis line. Talk about it and hopefully distract yourself for a while. It wasn’t three years wasted, it was three years of practice.

174380145,"i have treatment resistant anxiety. my friend who is a schizoaffective like i am, recommends i switch to zyprexa for the anxiety. he said the worst side effects for him was drooling. i feel pretty stable on risperidone though and it’s risky switching meds. i feel like i can live with the anxiety even though it’s very disabling. thoughts?"
174380142,"Most of my jobs were in the military. I mowed lawns in high school and worked at Dairy Queen flipping burgers. Then I joined the Navy and was a storekeeper. Now it’s called logistical specialists. I got out after two years and went to college. Then I sold cars for a while and became a store manager at a video arcade. Then I joined the Marine Corps. I was a helicopter pilot and a transport airplane pilot. I had many ground jobs. I was mostly an operations officer but also an aviation safety officer, maintenance officer and even had a tour in command. I was in charge of all kinds of operations. I was the operations officer for a helicopter squadron, an assistant airfield manager, a harbor operations officer, a future plans and exercise officer. I was in charge of non-combatant evacuation operations overseas. I planned counter narcotics, anti alien smuggling, anti human trafficking and anti terrorism operations. I did two tours in Iraq as a combat helicopter pilot. I did my last four years in the Ma
rine Corps schizophrenic and got fired several times. It was tough. Since I got out of the Marine Corps I have worked as a career counselor for soldiers getting out of the army. Then I went and designed exercises for the Marine Corps as a contractor. Then I became an assistant manager at Walmart. I didn’t last too long at any of those. Then went on SSDI and shortly thereafter got stable and went back to school and became an aircraft mechanic. After I graduated I went to work as an aircraft mechanic but that didn’t pay too much so I went back to work doing contract work as an aviation subject matter expert for the Marines doing exercises. Then I went to work for the government as a Census Field manager and now as a revenue Officer with the IRS. I went off of SSDI last year. I can get it back until June of 2022 if I get fired or out of work without having to apply again. I have turned down a lot of good jobs out of state in the last year."

176148704,"Ok, good to know this… we were wondering on this with my mother… she asks herself if the zyprexa makes me more paranoid… I am very worried person because of my sz lately, I am even scared that I’ll die cause I am affected even physically from this mi and I lived in isolation for 20 years. Idk if the inactivity can kill me now…"
176148705,"Yes actually, I had a friend see the same apparition I have seen for years. I just 15 when she saw it and was the only person to see him ever. She caught it out of the corner of her eye and said something along the lines of “oh my gosh, I thought I just saw someone on your couch” and continued on with what we were doing. I waited a long time to tell her I see him constantly. I also had a family friend tell me that he saw the little boy I used to see as a kid… but based on the direction of the conversation, I think that was probably not true It’s really hard when people think they see what you see or play into them. I still struggle with seeing the man."
176148706,How long have you been off meds?
176148707,"I actually went to a new one today. After looking at x-rays, he said I have narrowing of the spinal canal, post laminectomy syndrome (ie it hurts after back surgery), and “a lot, a lot” of arthritis."
176148708,"I am at the mercy sometimes of a very disturbed individual. I mean I admit I’m fuc*_NAME_ up but for me it means that I ain’t aware of important stuff going on and I can’t keep up with most people. This guy lives here and he treats people like we are solely here for him to control. I was in my room today with my neighbor above me. All I literally did was think in my head, “Wait a minute, I have a little power, I’m not powerless.” And the guy picked up on it. I know by now what he’s going to do. He twisted, manipulated, used, controlled, intimidated and pretty much took it away, the guy (who everyone swears is not doing anything to me). It was none of his damn business. I get so tired. I can’t help it if I was born stunted as a human being. But sh*t like this just literally drives me crazy. I missed the train somewhere in my life, I just wasn’t aware of crap like this growing up, the power of the mind. I ran outside and pounded on his door but that’s just going to get me kicked o
ut and beat up. The guy is seriously mean. Please don’t ask what he is actually doing to me. I am at wits end and can’t figure out if it’s magic, osmosis, plain intimidation, or if it’s all in my head or power. It seems real to me."

176148713,Anyone feeling a general sense of anxiety in the pit of their stomach? It seems to be a recurring theme for me. Not necessarily related to mental illness but I’m sensitive and can be in tune psychically with what is going on in the world. What do you do to relax and feel happy?

One thing that a lot of people think I had delusions about was our neighbors being out to get us. Then we had 3 calls to protective swrvices against us and two complaining that we keep curtains drawn and they never saw in. That was a real eye opener to my husband that I wasn’t hallucinating being watched.

176148802,"So… I recently read an article about DNA computing information. Do I have any idea what that actually means? Very little but I do wonder… if DNA can be used to compute information… then in a distant future humanity along with quantum computers might we get to the point where our bodies’ reactions to any substance/matter can be analyzed on a molecular level in order to somehow structurally change what we need in order to live. In simpler terms I mean, so what happens when say a person touches an orange? That minuscule effect, does it physically benefit even the fingers of a person? Can that minuscule effect be improved upon if it is somehow beneficial? With DNA computing and quantum computers, I have a feeling such things will be a possibility. Medicine as we know it could very well change in terms of being a treatment to being a cure. I don’t necessarily mean gene editing. Now to be honest, the first thing that I wondered was if there could be a way for humanity to find an alternate sourc
e of sustenance in terms of oxygen. I don’t mean anytime soon but maybe in the far distant future with DNA computing and improved technology, who knows? With that in mind, I guess the same can be said about telepathy. By that time we likely won’t be considered homosapiens anymore. Most of this is more along the lines of science fiction stuff. The beneficial orange effect theory seems more plausible but then there are things that were in science fiction novels written decades ago that have come into fruition. Just some nerdy stuff. I mean there are already skin creams, vitamin C pills, and other things that originate from oranges. My thoughts are that the ability to measure the positive effects and gather that information even at an ephemeral level will most definitely improve with DNA computing and computers capable of solving theories and equations found in quantum physics. Even the largest building in the world began with a grain of sand. Or in simple terms, small things make up the big things. Oh and n
o worries, I’m not trying to feed any telepathy delusions. Empirical evidence at this point suggests telepathy is only possible with technology. I do sometimes wonder though, I mean before mankind developed the ability for speech. We communicated with gestures, facial expressions, and maybe grunts or noises. I for sure have seen a cat looking at me and realized it is implying the following sentiment, “Don’t ???? with me right now.” Now everyone… go rub an orange all up in yo face. Is you telepathic now?"

She makes notes of what she ‘sees’, but she’s convinced it is real and is un-phased by evidence to the contrary, and does not like to discuss it with me or the psychiatrist, or any of her friends. Strong, positive social ties can help develop more accurate evaluations of the external world, serving as surrogates or validators for the person’s own perceptions — but only if the person is receptive. I’m happy you found a way to work through it over time. I’m hoping some others might share their story as well."

I will take a 200mg + a 100mg pill instead until my exam is done, in case it was a manufacturing error and more of my 300mg pills are affected. I finally fell asleep at 3.30 AM, after having been in bed for more than 4 hours, and I slept for 6.5 hours, which is fairly little considering I took 500mg in total instead of my 300mg regular dose. I also haven’t had any alcohol in about a week."

I’d suspect too that meds that help with the positive symptoms therefore the negs become more pronounced or you notice them more? I’m not sure there’s a direct link from meds to negatives although I’m no expert.

We analyzed the cases of 175 individuals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tokyo Medical and Dental University Medical Hospital for suicidal self-injury to determine whether alcohol consumption or an excessive use of prescribed psychotropic medications prior to self-injury is more common in patients with adjustment disorder. During a 7-year period (July 2006 to June 2013) following their deliberate self-injuries, 971 patients were admitted to the ICU. Our study sample (n=175) was restricted to patients with adjustment disorder (n=48), major depressive disorder (n=90), o
r schizophrenia (n=37). The outcome variable was alcohol consumption or excessive use of medications prior to suicidal self-injury. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the patients with adjustment disorder more commonly showed alcohol consumption or excessive medication use prior to their suicidal self-injury compared to those with schizophrenia (odds ratio: 8.10; 95%CI: 2.97-24.60). To inhibit suicidal self-injury among patients with adjustment disorder, it is important to continue efforts to provide psychoeducation about alcohol use and to instruct the patients to take their prescribed medication(s) only as directed by their physician."

I think about all the times I was awkward speaking during the day (especially to the other hostesses since I’m gonna keep seeing them) and about little mistakes that don’t matter much but irritate other people around me who know how everything works already. I’m trying my hardest, and that’s really all that matters but I hate feeling like an outsider and getting in the way of others, it makes me wish I didn’t exist (not in a suicidal way, but like, wish I wasn’t born or could fade away entirely or something)"

174380217,You never had friends? Can’t you talk to them on messenger voice or video call?

174380229,"Yeah but animals don’t get schizophrenia, so what do they test it on?"
176149073,Awesome. Glad your okay.
176149074,"Because I have psychosis. I’ve been praised and lauded for my personality, kindness, etc…but I’ve done horrible things during my psychotic episodes. I don’t even know what I did and I keep thinking of possible senarios of crimes I committed. Even if I am innocent, I know that the fact I have psychosis will make me the most inept person, and I will not be lauded for my achievements because of my psychosis. Once everyone finds out that I am mentally ill, I will be abandoned. I believe I will die inept and worthless. I will be the least to be remembered. I hate myself for being so inept and useless."
176149075,I really enjoy reading your poetry _AT_MENTION_ . I find myself visualizing the description in each line.
176149076,I voted no. Possibly if they let you vent but most of the time no. I think most psychologists I’ve met have been seriously disturbed and one made me psychotic by asking questions I couldn’t answer. I had one psychologist gang up on me with my mum n stepdad and all three of them were calling me a liar and taking my stepdads side though he was abusive . He had the psychologist around his little finger. I felt so betrayed and vulnerable and I had been wronged and they were blaming me for their faults and wrong doings. They were so unprofessional and harmed me. They did not help me they harmed me. No I don’t believe in them for me. Some people might find the right one but it’s uncommon. No I never want to be abused by one again.
176149077,"Its labor day too in Canada, my parents and brothers are home not working. I shaved my hair and beard earlier. I play too much with my hair when its long. Its like OCD idk."
176149078,"It doesnt work like that, you cant just stop meds and then restart them after you’re psychotic. When you’re psychotic you will refuse meds and meds might stop working requiring higher doses. Also psychosis damages the brain and life/relationships etc"
176149079,"avoid dept. Thats the most impotant lesson. Mr trumph didn’t learn the lesson. Make securative savings bank account of 10.000 dollars for things you have to have. Avoid alcohol, street drugs, junkfood and cigarettes."

I was going to warn you that when they do the echocardiogram, sometimes they have to push really hard on your ribs to get the images and if you’re sensitive to pain/pressure at all it can hurt pretty bad. But if you’re not extra sensitive to pain it shouldn’t be too bad."
176149088,Similar thing has happened to me several times

176149091,I was hearing what sounded like Angels singing coming our of the living room. But it stopped when I went out there. Maybe my sz is acting up.

176149093,Yeah _AT_MENTION_ I’d say the 1 lb gain is trivial but I’m just surprised it’s gone up at all?? I think I’m gonna wait till next Wednesday in the morning to weigh myself again. Sounds like a good idea. If I’m up another pound I gotta start questioning my diet. Hope it all works. _AT_MENTION_ with the heat wave I’ve been drinking water more than usual but also more dehydrated thanks!

176149095,Good job! What a fun hobby!
176149096,I rarely go out and I don’t get lonely. Last Saturday evening my brother took me for a drive to a fashionable village nearby. We had something to eat there. I saw lots of fashionable people leading lives I wish I had led lol. But now today Monday I feel lonely. The weather is getting nice now and Id like to go into a park in town. But it’ll probably backfire and I’ll just come away feeling lonely again.
176149097,headphones work wonders.
176149098,It gets worse when your anxiety is high which today it has been. And since my phlegm is so bad I haven’t been able to intake nicotine like I usually do.

176149099,i’d go for outside walk too… on the treadmill sounds boring. When i go for a walk with my dad i usually walk for like 1.5 hours.

176149101,I didn’t know what schizoaffective meant. I ignored my diagnosis for some greater of two years. Complete denial. If they had said schizophrenia or bipolar I may have taken it more seriously. So unfortunately in my case I got diagnosed sza. Although that’s my Dx still

I had two babies at home, and not what I wanted to hear, but still went back to school to study poetry/dance/art, etc."
176149115,Over the past few years I have had quite a lot of jobs. When I say a lot I mean A LOT. After the consultant reccomended part-time I found something suitable and have been in this job for a whole year. I am so happy. It’s not finiancially great as I don’t get the same money and have to stop spending so much but it’s going well… I am considering applying for PIP if I get it it would be great otherwise at least i attempted it.
176149116,"The biker at work was in prison for 16 years. He’s just this little, wizened 70 year old guy with a bad temper but I get along with him and one other guy pretty well. Sometimes he really pisses me off though. Sometimes he’s kind of a troublemaker and I get really angry and worked up about it. But he’s actually really funny and we talk every day. I don’t let him know this but I kinda think we get along because I’m not the best social person but neither is he. His job is emptying trash, that’s almost all he does. He always picks things out of the trash and gives them to me. Some of the stuff is good, some isn’t. He gives me pens, staplers. rulers, calculators. Today he even picked a really good backpack out of a wastebasket that a soldier had thrown away. I get some really good stuff that I can use sometimes. The problem is that he is used to giving me food items now. The soldiers throw away whole boxes of unopened food from cookies and candy to Mac and cheese mix and beef jerky. For th
e first couple years it was great. It was his way of being nice. But this past 6 months all this “good” food is often expired. Some as long as 6 months or even more. I have to throw it out. I don’t know if all this food has been this way all along and I just noticed now but all this free food that I thought was so good is inedible most of the time even though it looks good. The thing is, I don’t want to tell him and hurt his feelings. He’s had a hard life and this his major way of being nice to someone and I would hate to wreck it. That’s the dilemma I face. Like I said before, sometimes he makes me so mad that I just want to hurt his feelings deliberately. But most of the time when I accidentily hurt his feelings I feel bad for the guy. His life ain’t exactly great either. Sometimes, I literally want to hit the guy, but I would never do it. Yeah, that’s my weakness. I hate hurting other people’s feelings and sometimes it’s a liability."
176149117,Think of a diagnosis as a working title. It’s subject to change
176149118,I guess it’s true I don’t even know if I like peer coaching yet or whether or not it’s stressful. But I do like people and mostly signed up just to “get more involved” socially. Overall my life is good right now and I just want a good work life balance. Yes I think I’ll give this job a try and just pick what I like better. I’m really excited to be working again! My life is almost complete and all I feel I need now is a bf and a car!

176149120,Or is obsessing over someone who died also part of it …or not wanting to see anyone and meet anyone and wanting to disappear also part of it … what about me wanting to donate my brain as a living _PERSON_ a psychosis but still
176149121,"Thanks _PERSON_!! I don’t always know what to do about my brother … we’re really close, but I’m afraid I’m setting things up for a major mind-(_PERSON_), for him. Mostly because - I can’t quit smoking. (and I’m an uncle 4 times over now, factoring in my sister). Also the way I’m wired I’m always thinking I’m going to bring shame to my family. But I just gotta do me. How are you _AT_MENTION_… was that your most recent _PERSON_ who had the heart attack? I had trouble making heads or tails there."
176149122,"Not really relevant to OP, but I had thoughts that I got something messing with me all the time. I have this re-occurring fear and delusion and nightmare and recall or w/e, that I was gang-raped in the shower at possibly the mental hospital and I was murdered. Then my soul left my body and I went back in time to relive my life. I guess that’s what I think happened and ????. I remember the people/patients at the mental hospital back in 2015. I don’t have any physical evidence at all but I think it wasn’t ‘simulated’ or a ‘simulated experience’. I think it really did happen in a past life or slightly different timeline and I avoided it by being scared and avoiding these people like the plague. I don’t know who was ultimately behind it. It could have been a perfect storm or a storm brewing or I was targeted because of what I was saying during my psychosis or even related to something huge and big like a grand old conspiracy like connected to the government or Deep State for some reason
. Good luck suing, because I’ll never get a cent or a dime from these people. It would just prove my point and embarrass them. It often feels like I’m a super soldier or Montauk Boy or Illuminati ‘slave’. Personally, I don’t think these people have anything to do with the Illuminati at all. They’re just street level thugs/criminals/drug criminals/gang-members. I’m missing years off my life, so it could have started in Northern California/Bay Area. It’s just a psychic hunch I had or recall. It would fall under the web or branch of MK-Ultra, which there are like 150+ sub-projects. I believe I’m very psychic. I was raped by men in my past lives in parallel universes or whatnot. I woke up in 2013 or some ???? in different dimensions. I’ve read that these sick pervs that run the montauk project are homosexuals in nature, which I’m definitely not. They even made or turned me bi-sexual in a distant past life/parallel universe, which I’m 110% not. I’m straight as an arrow. That’s how sick 
these people are. It took me years to get over the panic attacks I had in the shower. I felt constantly over-stimulated and ????. I don’t know why, but I think it had to do with me being a time traveler, _NAME_, and even possibly Q. Unfortunately, I don’t know where else to post. I think I’m constantly being bombarded with messages in my head designed to confuse, torture me, and make me say something stupid so I’ll wind up dead. There’s no evidence of these pervs doing this. It’s all EM through satellites and cell-phone towers."

176149138,"music dyslexia. Meaning, I get the notes and they’re placements turned around in my head, and on the staffs on the score. Makes it very difficult to read music. I don’t have dyslexia in reading printed text. I can read the printed word very well, in fact. I told my first piano teacher about my discovery many, many years ago and she told me that she had “never heard of music dyslexia”. But, she was an inexperienced teacher. I have never discussed this with my new teacher and I’ve employed him for the past eight years. I need to. I think I have figured out a way around this music dyslexia, finally. The notes on the bottom of both the treble and the bass clefs are on the left side of the piano. So, read from bottom of the staff to the top, and from left to right on the piano. Very simple. Makes reading much simpler and just so many seconds faster. Makes all the difference in the world. Makes it so you are just not so “all over the place” with your eyes, trying to figure things out. Makes 
it vastly easier. Now, just to get used to it. Takes practice."

If you are male you could try if more or less testosterone would help, natural testosteron boosters like ginger, onion juice, rooibos tea, fenugreek, king oyster mushrooms. If you exercise do you do thirty minutes cardio without a break, do you do push-ups? For supplements you could try some NO boosters like beet juice, pomegranate, arginine. Maybe that gives your heart some rest."

176149153,"I had another disturbing dream… I used to get them all the time. I mentioned it to my Dr and he turned me onto Prazosin. After slowly getting the dose up to 5mg the dreams stopped. In fact I didn’t remember any dreams at all. It was nice. Fast forward to about a month ago, out of the blue I started getting dizzy spells. They would happen upon standing, and when I would lie down or roll over in bed. Apparently that’s postural hypotension (low blood pressure) and my pdoc suspected the Prazosin was to blame. She asked me to lower the dose. I lowered the dose and the dizziness stopped. But the dreams started again. I decided to start the Prazosin back up and lower one of my other blood pressure meds instead but the dreams won’t stop. Why? So now what? Am I gonna have to increase the Prazosin until the dreams stop again. What a bunch of bad luck. Anyway, like I said, I had another bad dream. My heart is still racing a bit. My daughter was still little and I lost her in this big house. I went roo
m to room looking for her. I got confused because there were so many rooms. I became frantic. No one would help or take me seriously. I was checking bathtubs to make sure there was no water for her to drown in. I woke up in a total panic. I still can’t shake the feeling.

I tried my best to ignore it but when I leaned forward on my sofa they talked more quietly. I think they knew I was on to them. I am worried they think I am drug dealer or something. A guy in the village spread a rumour I was a drug dealer because I had a bigger tv than him.

176149219,"My counselors at day treatment have been slowly leading me towards recovery, only that recovery is covered with thorns and tree roots that slow me down. I watched a clip from The Green Book on a Saturday and thought I needed more of that in my life but I don’t know what it is. So I began visiting the art museum and doing art. Slowly I began to do more things like sign up to return to work and join cancer support group for my cousin. I feel like I walked a mile in my recovery and just today I discovered what it is I’m missing and it’s love. So simple. I love my family and my best friend and the beauty in art and I love the kids I substitute for at work and I love what’s left of my life and I love my cousin who has cancer and I find love when I watch a good movie and I guess I love someone romantically too though we’re not together at the moment. Sometimes I love China where I was born too and that’s why I get nostalgic watching travel documentaries about Japan. I guess I’m finding more 
of what I love and how to make these things grow and that’s where my recovery is coming from. Of course there’s also things I don’t love like the nausea and anxiety I get from my meds at night and my constant battle with mental illness. I feel like it’s what is helping me grow in my recovery. What are some things you truly love? Or really don’t love and wish were different?"

Technically he is a good guy though and he is ugly. _NAME_ is the attractive one in that story."

176149271,"Here is my take on it: Both sides on political spectrum implement variety of manipulation and gasslighting strategies just to steer, influence, or just plainly insult other people. Either for their own political gain or just to please some sort of pathology that one might be harboring. These type of uncivilized conversations is a form of psychological warfare, and it almost cannot be avoided because of political games that we play, and also who we are as humans, and how long it actually takes to develop proper high EQ that is needed to solve the problems without flipping out or starting to manipulate others. I would personally avoid calling anyone snowflake, no matter how “strongly” i disagree with anyone. That’s just my own personal opinion on the issue. It’s not like I am immune, I myself have a lot of work to do in this area. But acknowledging my own mistakes is story for good beginnings."

Try to distance yourself emotionally, and try to give people who say its a delusion enough trust that you at least question the belief even if a little bit. Bit by bit it might change or it might be less strong. That’s good either the belief wasn’t strong enough to handle scrutiny and had to change, or you feel less conflicted by it. Please keep trying to distance yourself from it and that’s about the best you can do. If it ever fully goes away might not matter as much as just giving it less power to emotionally affect you."

176149311,I compare myself to old friends and it brings me down. Especially because as a woman in America there’s a lot of pressure to look good and I really don’t anymore. Psych meds have really ?????? me up. Then I just really let myself go because I was so depressed and other life stuff. So when I see all my school friends having great lives and looking so healthy it’s really embarrassing. I guess it’s more embarrassment of my own life than jealousy of theirs.

174380302,"So I have been smoking weed about 4 times a day, every day for over a year now. I had an unrelated bout with my mind back in February that resulted in doubling my dosage but other than that my voices are better. I’m able to fight the negative because I am not depressed. I lost 60 pounds just from adding weed to my diet because I have physical health problems that limit my mobility and cause extreme pain most days so I have a viable reason for using such a dangerous substance but I know my body and I know my mind. This is in my case a spiritual attack and likely not schizophrenia and even my psychologist is left wondering if I’m not right about this. She encourages me to do what makes me happy and keeps me participating in the lives surrounding me instead of isolating my mind in the middle of work and if it is not harming me or causing me to harm others then she feels the marijuana has been a good thing FOR ME. It won’t be like this for everyone."

174380307,"https://onlinelibrary._NAME_.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajmg.b.32808 Although anxiety has long been reported as a common feature of the schizophrenia prodrome (_NAME_, 1978; _PERSON_, 2014; Tien & Eaton, 1992; Turnbull & Bebbington, 2001), using genetic instruments to proxy anxiety disorder, we found only weak evidence that increased odds of having anxiety increases risk of schizophrenia. The majority of the MR approaches we used however, indicated that a higher neuroticism score increases odds of schizophrenia. This result is in agreement with longitudinal studies that report an association between higher levels of neuroticism and increased risk of development of psychotic symptoms (_PERSON_, 2003; _PERSON_, 2002) and schizophrenia (_PERSON_, 2009; _NAME_ Os & _NAME_, 2001), as well as a previous MR of neuroticism and schizophrenia that used a generalized summary?data?based MR [GSMR] approach (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, et al., 2018). In contrast to the other methods, the MR _PERSON_ approach showed little evi
dence of association between neuroticism and schizophrenia. However, the power to detect causal effects using MR Egger, as well as the SIMEX bias adjustment method, is very sensitive to the amount of violation in the NOME assumption which is potentially still too large in the current study (_PERSON_, 2016)."

176149421,"I’m also getting the Covid19 vaccine on Thursday. I found another place that is open to those under 50 with health conditions in my state. My brother has been really insistent that I get the vaccine more-so than my parents have been. I appreciate his support because without it I would be less likely to get the vaccine. After I had to cancel my appointment due to transportation conflicts the next day they closed out for those under 50. Slots are being filled rapidly. They are rolling out vaccines pretty slow I don’t think its right even if there is a limited supply because of so many people spreading misinformation it should be more accessible to those who want them. They aren’t going to make it mandatory. I also don’t even know if I am immune or ever had covid19. I could have just had a different illness, and if I did I will be still less likely to get seriously ill or catch covid19 if I get the vaccine."
176149422,"When I used to think I was on camera 24/7 it was a scary time, now I know that that never happened it is easier for me, I figure if someone has hidden a camera to watch me, it is them that has a problem not me, so I could care less now if someone is watching"

176149430,Well I don’t need a different antidepressant I’m already on Wellbutrin. And Loxapine is literally the only antipsychotic I’ve found the helps control my psychosis so I don’t know what they can do about a med change.

174380329,"My clozapine has made my anxiety very severe that only benzo helps it but benzo has worsened my memory too. So I would like to reduce my clozapine to prolly 100mg from 175mg and add another antipsychotic to compensate and stop the benzo. I’m thinking about quetiapine but pdoc warns that it can mess with qtc interval on ECG report and worsen heart problems. My qtc is already above the normal levels. Once I get to 100mg clozapine, I will add an SSRI to fix anxiety. Right now all antidepressants worsen my anxiety attacks. Which antpsychotic should i add to clozapine ? Something effective and with least side effects Here’s list of antipsychotics which failed: Failed Meds: Amisulpride, Aripiprazole, Blonanserin, Olanzapine, Risperidone"

176149436,"This is old news, but it’s back in the news and since it’s such an important topic, it is worth repeating. Dr. _NAME_ discusses the brain and gene basis of autism. TL:DR: Brain imaging studies have revealed unusual growth patterns in individuals with autism, with overgrowth early in life. That early overgrowth is followed by a period of slowed or average growth, resulting in a normal or slightly larger brain volume in older children with autism."
176149437,I will be getting my first shot Friday. Looking forward to it.
176149438,You “go high”? Are you saying high as in hallucinating? Having no voices is a good start though. But you need to feel grounded also. Have you tried every individual AP the pdoc suggests? Could be a good fit somewhere.
174380330,"It seems like the scientists here speculatively suggested that 20hz might be better for schizophrenia, although they warned about self-experimentation since it might be harmful. It does seem like you would need to know since 20hz and 40 hz had completely different effects on cytokines. Wouldn’t want to guess wrong and push things in the wrong direction."

Lately I’ve been looking to a picture of my home where I was growing up. I find it to be one of few places where I go when I need some solitude, maybe because I’ve walked every inch in that photo when I was a kid, and because I had the most warm/action-packed memories there, and that comforts me a lot.

In a few lessons I think I improved and got used to this new guy, so that it is more fun to do and I’m much less frightened. The guy complimented me on my dancing, jeej. I’m quite sure he is not interested in me though, and my mini-crush is subsiding as well. Maybe part of it was also the excitement of the new dancing, the being close to a guy again. So I’m not asking him out. Just the dancing, no romance…"

His body is just adjusting to a new way to function. You aren’t stupid, either. You need to be patient and give tourself time to recover. If you had just been in the hospital with leukemia, I doubt anyone would be expecting you to jump right back into school with no adjustment. It takes time to recover from being hospitalized."

He said when I get my depot Risperdal Consta injections, I have to go with a 1 and a half inch needle. He said the 1 inch needles are not long enough. I told him I’m willing to go along with that."

176149620,"It’s highly interesting about the showering for only 30 seconds. For me it’s just trouble switching gears, and also dealing with the water temperature differential. But once I’m in, I stay in for awhile. I use hot water and envy people who can take cold showers because I apparently am realizing more about myself that I am a man who leans toward appreciating the masculine(or even stereotypical type macho-ness in this example.) I know I’m not for everyone, and maybe things come out of me that aren’t the right thing to say always. But I’ll put it like this: I know what the word ‘conflate’ means… and maybe I ‘evolved’ into someone who conflates “differentiating” with the masculine. And if I can utter that sentence, I probably can be spared and live to fight more appropriate battles going forward. _AT_MENTION_ I know I ventured off a little but I still hope you can appreciate my showering comments."
176149621,"Yeah, sounds like TD. If caught in it’s early stages it can be reversed or stopped from getting worse. What also comes to mind is that when my doc was switching my meds around, he tried Abilify on me. I started pushing my hair off my forehead repetively. I didn’t attribute that to the Abilify, in fact, I didn’t think the hair pushing meant anything at first until a counselor pointed out that I was doing it a lot during our meeting. That brought it to my attention and I told my doc and he stopped the Abilify and the hair pushing stopped."

My pdoc creeps me out. He always asks how I’m sleeping and I feel like he wants to put me into an eternal sleep and drain my blood.

176149631,"I understand your concerns. I used to get command hallucinations telling me to kill other people, and it used to really wear me down having to constantly put up with that. What I would do is seek out a medical professional and tell them everything and let them help you Don’t hold back. This is what used to happen to me when I reached breaking point It led to voluntary hospitalisation rather than forced on several occasions. Which means more freedom and privileges when you’re in there I also have to work to support myself, but I can imagine the added stress of family as well can really ramp up the pressure. Another thing I’d suggest is looking at your life, and make the decision as to whether the job you’re doing is causing some of your pain It sure as hell was for me.

Playing games in my late teens and early twentys were a great time. I remember buying the PlayStation 3 couple weeks after release from my part-time job money. I bought it with two controllers and two games for I think 639€. Resistance 2 multiplayer was great fun, I played hell out of Killzone 3 multiplayer. Or Metal Gear Solid 4, one of my favourite game of all time. I also was an avid pc gamer, even more than a console gamer, even if I started with consoles first.

176149669,Congratulations _AT_MENTION_!
176149670,Two spirits in my head (Alien and _NAME_) Alien the evil spirit tries to insert his thoughts in my head and sometimes removes them Mother in law trying to control my mind and read my thoughts and poison me (but that’s really possible as she’s a cold hearted woman) people can sometimes read my mind if I make eye contact devil trying to get into my body through my private parts (mild belief but it’s still there) my husband wants to kill me (as I want divorce)
174380382,"I think that in my case libido might be (maybe even quite significantly) lowered due to getting psychiatric medications. Some years ago I got only paroxetine and any drug against schizophrenia and sexual temptations were rather smaller during getting it, when I did not take paroxetine, I could have larger sexual drive and more impure thoughts, easier arousal. Since about 2,5 - 3 years I got olanzapine which was prescribed due to diagnosis of schizotypal disorder (F21 in ICD-10, international classification of illnesses) and it might also lower libido. I get sulpiride and chlorprothixene since about 2 years. I may have easier to fight with sins against chastity due to psychiatric medications. I consider sexual drive unimaginably(!) evil and not something healthy (especially in spiritual area). I want to stop getting drugs because I want to drive a car, which may be really helpful in getting a job. Psychiatric drugs can make me additionally disabled. I do not want the situation in which lack of sins 
against chastity is caused by meds which have negative side effects."

176149673,"Just don’t eat the product, then come back from break all googly-eyed…belting out Loverboy at the top of your lungs!"
176149674,"Thanks again. I read the Scientific American article. I have a feeling that in respect of things related to the mind, the arrow of causality always seems to point both ways. E.g. if people who are similar like each other, people who like each other become similar to each other, and if thought causes subvocalisations/whispers then subvocalisations/whispers will probably cause thought. I mused that this might be because time is a product of how we see the world, whereas in the mind there is no time, as some on this forum have suggested. Does this apply to imagining lifting weights causes us to be stronger, becoming stronger will cause us to imagine exercise? I am not sure. I do a lot of cycling, swimming, press ups, and occasionally karate, very badly. I recommend cycling. It is one of the few (?) ways of getting a work out sitting down."
176149675,Sometimes it has taken me weeks or months on meds for delusions to disappear. The fact that part of you knows it is a delusion may be a step in the right direction. Following the direction of your doctor if they ask you to give the medication time to work seems like a good idea.
176149676,A lot better thank you!
176149677,"The problem ive found is delusions of reference, weed will take you to the cleaners, If they aint so prominent, you will have a less hard time, You could even blaze with voices and be fine ! Sz varies so much !"
176149678,Do it it’ll look nice
176149679,I only didn’t get A’s when I was mentally ill. My ability to understand was muted and I could not care. There was no point in caring. You can’t bleed a turnip.
176149680,I hallucinate little kids a lot. I usually see more than one.
176149681,"hi _AT_MENTION_ , that’s a curious thing. I hope you can get to the bottom of it. My GP told me all anti-psychotics cause weight gain and lead to obesity & diabetes in a few short years. Don’t know how accurate that is, just the advise she gave me. I gained weight rapidly on Zyprexa so changed to Lurasidone which has elevated my cholesterol. She weighs me once every 6 months and tells me my BMI & if I’m in the healthy BMI range. I hope you’re in the healthy range now. Good luck with tapering off meds, I hope that goes well for you."
174380397,"So is being a leper, but I wouldn’t lose an arm over schizophrenia."
176149682,I rarely have anxiety anymore. I used to have chronic fear and panic attacks for 6 years. I think supplements and med changes helped a lot. I don’t know what happened but I got better. Caffeine does not help at all. I still drink a ton but I want to quit. I guess it’s the thought that counts. It’s hard. I realize I zone out and dissociate with caffeine. I just get nothing done and do nothing at all.
176149683,"Zone! I was in a zone when I took an intelligence test ordered by my psychiatrist. Therefore, he believed I was pretty darn bright. But he stood steadily by my side as I went through the disability process. Good luck to you in managing your doctors."
176149684,I often stim by biting my fingers. It’s something I do when I’m really overloaded with stress and anxiety. I might buy one too but my family might yell at me for it. So urgh.
176149685,"I didn’t believe I was ill because I could still somewhat function.I am on meds now,my reason is because of my wife.If I am on my own,I probably would quit them again"

176149687,"I am the same, nothing can be done."
176149688,"I took buspar for a little while and didn’t feel like it helped a lot. It definitely works for some people, as my doctor says it’s pretty well prescribed, But not for me. Good luck with the buspar, I hope you get some relief."
176149689,"OK, _AT_MENTION_ , thanks. My brain fries"
176149690,I never said you did anything wrong.
176149691,I am on invega and seroquel
176149692,"Personally, I find alcohol to be worse. Makes the hallucinations worse, removes my inhibition, I start risk taking, can get dangerous. THC in high doses can trigger me, but far less than the drink. Neither are good, but I’d rather THC. The one that instantly puts me into psychosis is any type of speed. Uppers are horrible for my symptoms."
176149693,"Yup, thats what a few people have said but sometimes i think its real. Like not front page newspapers marketed to a national audience but mini online websites. Lol, i guess im still kinda crazy… or not."
176149694,I’m functioning well with out symptoms. But just had my second episode of psychosis and am on 10mg Olanzapine. Hoping I can make it off of AP again
176149695,If dying was just a peaceful ending of reality on Earth I would have no issues with it at all - im just scared of dying with ‘extra baggage’ that is painful. Dying is one thing - where I’ll end terrifies me.

174380395,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of add-on ramelteon therapy on sleep and circadian rhythm disruption in patients with schizophrenia: A randomized controlled trial. A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, BR _PERSON_, M _NAME_, S _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology , Dec 2019 09 The sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions in schizophrenia are attributed to a decrease in nocturnal melatonin level which may worsen if treated with conventional sedative drugs. This study was planned to evaluate the effects of add-on ramelteon on sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in schizophrenia. A randomized, rater-blinded clinical trial was conducted on 120 patients with schizophrenia. Patients were categorized into predominantly positive (PG) or negative (NG) symptoms depending on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scoring, and then they were randomized into control (haloperidol/risperidone) or test (add-on ramelteon) groups. After recruitment, 
baseline serum melatonin, serum AANAT, urinary melatonin and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were evaluated. Patients were reassessed after 4 weeks of therapy with antipsychotics with or without ramelteon. A significantly greater increase in night-time melatonin level (PG: 10·19; 95%CI: 1·42 to 18·97; p = 0·024; NG: 18·74; 95%CI: 8·48 to 29·0; p = 0·001), decrease in PSQI scores (PG: -1·57; 95%CI: -2·59 to -0·55; p = 0·003; NG: -2·49; 95%CI: -4·59 to -0·39; p = 0·021), increase in urinary melatonin (PG: 0·20; 95% CI: 0·056 to 0·35; p = 0·008; NG :0·15; 95% CI: 0·01 to 0·29; p = 0·034), increase in serum AANAT (PG: 4·61; 95%CI: 1·34 to 7·87; p = 0·007; NG:3·46; 95%CI: 1·30 to 5·63; p = 0·002) and improvement in PANSS score were found in patients receiving add-on ramelteon. The increase in serum melatonin and decrease in PSQI score were greater with predominantly negative symptom group in comparison to positive symptom group. Ramelteon may be considered as an add-on therapy 
with antipsychotic drugs for sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in schizophrenia."

174380401,Do you have positive symptoms?
176149720,"Would you be able to attend a gym? If the answer is yes. Sign up for a few month membership. Ask if they do fitness assessment before you start. General fitness assessments are free of charge for new members (in most gyms) unless you specify that you need a personal training. Once you familiarize with machinery and free weights, start slowly, and only increase weight overtime so that your muscle, connective tissues, and joints can acclimate to load properly. Don’t injure yourself or you can be out for good. Fitness instructor can help you out to start on the right track. To lose weight you still going to need a negative energy balance, so that your body can start burning that excess fat. Walking is good, but I’d rather focus that energy and time that you have attending the gym instead."

176149722,"I love summer because it is great for walking the dog and taking nice strolls. The nice weather makes me want to be more active which equals more excersize. Now it is winter so i don’t get to do this anymore. I still try to occasionally go to the mall and just walk around, it is not much but atleast it is something. This winter i want to shoot for snowshoeing probably like twice a month or so. That will help some. I should probably get a pair of cross country skis. We have alot of land so i could definately use them."
176149723,Woo hoo! Thanks a lot _AT_MENTION_! I am horrible AND festive!

176149729,"i personally do not think that hell is a ‘place’. Its possible that ‘demons’ or bad spirits are telling you these things in order to depress you, or steer to you away from thinking about God. I think its a worthy topic to contemplate but these negative voices can make it difficult. My thoughts used to tell me the same sorts of things, but its a delusion. God loves you very much and wants you to be with him in eternal joy when we pass from these bodies. Hope youre doing well _AT_MENTION_"

176149733,"I think that once on APs diet has to be restricted. Doctors should tell the patient from the outset that you really have to watch what you eat from now on. Of course, if the doc tells the patient this then they are even more reluctant to take them, but the facts are once on APs the majority of people have a metabolic lowering and become fat. Also, the meds can make people crave food more (like haldol) did for me before I was taken off it for tardive dyskenesia, nevertheless pizzas and deep fried food surely must be a no no. I have discovered I am a coeliac and I now have to plan a healthy diet regime for when I get off keto. While on keto I have been avoiding barley, wheat and rye anyway. Any ideas about a scrumptious healthy diet for a coelaic _AT_MENTION_?"

174380408,Its giving me side effects that are nearly unmanageable. I have terrible urinary incontinence. Often I wet the bed. I always have to wear a diaper and pad. It’s so gross. I hate it.
176149736,_AT_MENTION_ I was having a difficult time with concentration and memory and when I started taking fish oil to help lower my cholesterol I noticed a really big improvement in both those areas. Perhaps you could look into getting some fish oil and see if it helps you too.
176149737,"Most ap’s kill serotonin and dopamine I believe. There’s not a lot to do about it. I tried supplementing with herbs that raise serotonin, but then the ap stopped working and I had to go to a even higher dose of ap’s. So lately I’ve been focusing on other brain factors like taurine, gaba and melatonin. I have a theory that the ap’s also impedes many other factors in the brain unintentionally while they are targeting serotonin and dopamine. For example melatonin is made from serotonin, so that’s a unintentional negative effect. So I have been supplementing with gaba and taurine for a little while and they seem to make me more normal, less anxious, and more able to relax in the daytime too. Only possible noticable side effect so far is that I get some slight tremors in one or two fingers from time to time. Melatonin I’ve been taking on and off for some years. It seems to be safe and improves sleep. None of these things will cure anything, but can perhaps make things a little better for s
ome people. I will post more about taurine and gaba when I have tried it long term."
176149738,Today I learned that there is such a thing as a wormery. That is cool.

Over the last month I’ve gained 20 lbs. that’ll take some hard work and discipline to lose the excess weight, I’m not counting on it though- I go through stretches where I’m very lethargic. Now is one of those times."

176149743,Being recorded and followed.
176149744,"I feel like pumping myself with dopamine. I bought a 15% dopamine supplement. Hopefully it won’t make me psychotic, I will start with one 120mg L-Dopa pill. But I have a feeling that it will cause positive symptoms as it boosts dopamine in all the brain while Abilify stabilizes dopamine, blocking it when its high and boosting it when its low."
174380404,"I find calorie restricted diets only work for a specific period of time, and eventually the weight goes back on The only cure I seem to have found is physical labour and going to the gym 4 times a week, I have lost 21 kilos. Been here before, and I have gone from 59 kilos (Calorie Restricted) to 95kg (Olanzapine) then down to 78 kilos then back up to 96 kilos (Not sure why) now back down to 73 kilos.

176149748,"Yes. My parents are robots though. Benevolent robots, but robots. They don’t understand emotion at all. It doesn’t compute. My brother can be halfway there, unfortunately. I don’t think he’s always been that way though. He’s in a caring profession and I think he’s hit that empathy burn-out thing. His wife is good to talk to, though. And she has schizoaffective, so she’s even good with that. I’m afraid I may rely on her too much though. I do still have other family. Only one aunt in town, but she understands empathy (also gets hurt by my parents…more than me really as she hasn’t given up trying). She gets clingy though, but I think it’s simply because of how lonely she is, especially now. I had invited her over for dinner this Thursday, but my parents sort of canceled that. Maybe I can find another time for us to put on the calendar. I do have extended family I could call. Specifically one aunt who took me in for a year when I was a teen (for witness protection reasons). She’
ll chat with me for an hour or so if I call her up. It’s so hard to do it though. I don’t know why. I also have my husband’s side of the family. One of his parents will be coming over within the hour to give me night meds. I see them 4 times a day when he’s gone. So, I really shouldn’t be this lonely."

You can make a weekly schedule and write showers in it three times. It has helped me a lot to know that on mondays, wednesdays and fridays I HAVE to shower, and that if I don’t, others will feel bad because of my smell. I have negatives too, and for years I refused to take any responsibility for my inaction. I finally did, and guess what? Once you get used to it, it ain’t so bad. You just gotta stop whining and go do it. You’re a grown man acting like a spoiled child. Get it together!"

176149757,I really like it _AT_MENTION_ . Maybe you can find other musicians to collaborate with in Stockholm. It might be a good way to make some friends.
176149758,For so long I needed an antidepressant. Then at some point it was either not worth the negatives anymore. Or it started making me manic/psychotic. It just doesn’t agree with me at all anymore. Anyways ssris have horrible side effects. Every single one I have ever tried. I’m happy to be off of them. Rather now I lean towards more antipsychotics. Antipsychotics don’t have as many side effects at least not weird ones for me as antidepressants. Like the sedation or weight gain are common ones. But I always get the weirdest freaking side effects from antidepressants. But for so long I did need an antidepressant. But now I’m at a point I just don’t need it anymore. And I’m happy to be off away from those strange side effects. My arm still shakes from Zoloft a year after stopping Zoloft

I change my clothes everyday and my underwear when it starts to smell. Before I stabilized I didn’t care about staying clean and lost all motivation to shower but with time I made it a habit. I also dress nicer and wear stylish clothes. It helps keeping me feeling good about myself. I recommend everyone do it.

176149811,My voices are religious based. They tell me G-d hates me and that I’m going to hell. They also try to get me to curse G-d. I used to think they were real spirits but what helped me determine they were not real is that it must be a chemical imbalance because medication makes them go away and stress increases them. They also just kinda talk about whatever my mind is thinking about and often repeat the same phrases over and over. They are just in your head. Mine command me too but I’d never listen to their commands because it’s things like “kill your brother” which I find abhorrent because I love my brothers very much. Other times they just tell me to take my antidepressant and not to take my antipsychotic. I take my AD not because they tell me to and I take my AP anyways.

So much so that one of them will probably eat your cheesecake tonight without worrying that it’ll end with anything but a laugh.

176149915,"Lol, permission is only for those with insight. Those with lack of insight such as mental illness, you cannot decide whether you should take ect or not, it’s the doctor who decides for your best interest. You can confirm what I just said with your doctor. And if you are inconsistent with medicine, there is a 1/6 chance that the same medicine might not work for you once you start having symptoms"

176149919,ok! Thanks for helping me hash some of this out. I’m trying to get a better understanding and learn from other perspectives.
174380446,"Our medical system can’t handle those already here. There are some bad things happening. overcrowding, poor treatment, no treatment, waiting lists, etc. Don’t take it personal, but an economic reality is that demand always exceeds supply when something is “free”.

174380447,"Right, but they might instead have a personality disorder- those people tend to have issues as well, but they don’t necessarily take meds. An example of that is antisocial personality disorder."
176149924,"I understand…It is always a bit difficult what is a genuine bad vibe, one that is right, and what is a paranoid feeling. At least for me. Not sure if that is the same for you. If you have a bad vibe though, you should indeed not continu dating!"

176149927,Kids are fun. My daughter was so witty to about 12ish. After 13 she hated me. She was picked on a lot though. I think it was bc she looked different. She was the only brown ish child among a sea of white. She did have a few good friends though. My daughter is in my profile pic with me. (My stepmom keeps getting onto me bc I would call my daughter “my brown baby”. I mean she’s darker than me and her father is Hispanic.)
176149928,"Thanks _NAME_, I’ll get over it, I usually do. I had a cat, I wasn’t great at looking after her so I won’t get another pet. I just wonder how people deal with it."

176149930,The thing is that I’m fully aware of what’s going on…
176149932,Every morning i wake up with a migraine. It’s been over a month since a started Strattera. It happens every morning before I take the 25mgs. I told my psychiatrist he asked if I wanted to Increase dose lol. I went to doctor she prescribed topomax 25mgs at night. So it worked I guess but no more energy and the whole point of Strattera is to help me focus and feel motivated. I slept all day yesterday The induced mania was less bad but then I was hearing whispers as I fell asleep. I’m starting classes in the fall. If I can’t successfully withdraw from all the medications idk what I’ll do I can’t live like this.

176149935,"It’s a really persistent feeling for me, too. It’s so frustrating because, you know, people actually DO get obsessed & stalk people on the internet in this day & age. So it’s hard for me to discern what’s real & what’s a delusion. Doesn’t help I’ve had real experience with the real thing. My coping mechanism is to just tune ALL of it out & figure if someone wants to say something to me, they’ll say it to me directly, you know? Or if they say something that resonates with something I’ve said online, I just assume it’s coincidence. It’s hard but I think it’s the only way to stay sane. I am also off most of social media, except in an anonymous capacity. That helps loads."

176149939,"I gotta a cool sister. I got two cool sisters. My sisters dog died last year when she had a dog stroke or heart attack. She was 14 years old. The dog and my sister were perfect for each other. My sister is cute even at age 61 and looks way younger than her actual age. She’s also small and very outgoing and cheert and friendly. And her old dog was exactly the same way and I loved that dog. After she died my sister told me that after my sister, I was her dogs favorite person! I was surprised but it felt good. After about 4 months she got another dog and when my sister invited me over to see her new dog I was really looking forward to meeting the new family member. I love dogs but when I first saw this dog my first impression was negative. I guess my first impression of him physically to be honest was that he was very unappealing. He wasn’t cute or cheery or energetic or good looking. He wasn’t anything but I kept an open mind. He’s my sisters dog so I hid my feelings and I met him and again, 
I was disappointed. He wasn’t mean at all but he was scared and cowering and no wagging tail. Hey, he’s a living, breathing animal and deserves compassion and a chance. So I give him a chance every time I see him and after 5 months he’s improved but going back to my first impression, the strongest thought in my mind was: why did my sister get this dog? I am loyal to him now but at the time I was so surprised at my sisters choice of out of all the nice looking friendly dogs available she got this one. Actually, after seeing them together, I know why, it’s because the dog really likes her and they bonded but he is scared of everyone else. My sister got him from the shelter and it’s obvious he must have been neglected or traumatized in the past (he’s about 4 years old). But she got her old dog from the shelter too. I bend over backwards for this dog, doing everything in my power to be friendly and not scare him. And we’ve made a little progress and he knows I won’t hurt him but he still cowers an
d barks at me and never wags his tail. And I am at my sisters alone with him right now because my sisters is taking a vacation in Mexico and I am here to feed him, walk him, and keep him company. He’s actually laying at my feet at this moment which is huge progress because usually when I watch him he hides in the corner and stays there occasionally barking and an occasional growl. But it dawned on me when I walked in the front door, my sister is going to have the fact that he may make progress but his basic nature is he’s scared and whatever happened in the past really screwed him up. I will stay loyal but I am getting tired of walking on egg shells around him. I don’t see him frequently but often enough that we know each other. It’s kind of sad and my sister sees him with the family and she is a realist but up until now she had herself convinced that he is like any other dog but now it pains me because she is starting to see the real picture that the rest of the family has problems with him. IDK. It
s a real situation, a real problem. It can be solved maybe, but it is kind of making things awkward."
176149940,Oh _AT_MENTION_ I’m so sorry you experienced this! What happened after you bit her? Did she press charges? I’m very glad you never jumped on the track! _AT_MENTION_ Aww! I ache for you! Your identity is not your illness. You need to be treated with respect and compassion! _AT_MENTION_ How sad! I feel so bad for you! You must have been really upset! Do you talk to her now? _AT_MENTION_ That’s terrible! I am moved over your situation. I wish I could them away and you never experienced them! _AT_MENTION_ It sounds not fair! It’s awful when people make assumptions!

Some days during a flare up of dementia type symptoms i feel so stupid and scared. It’s a really scary feeling. But it can get better if it is sz, so try not to worry yourself too much. I know it’s hard."

Repeat that to yourself over and over, out loud if you have to. Have someone else reality check you as well if you can. Even if you dont believe it, keep doing it and I promise it will make you feel a little better. Thats the only advice I can give besides getting med adjustment, which it sounds like you may need."

176149988,"How long has it been _AT_MENTION_ that you have had problems. Maybe your doc is using amed to treat each symptom. Because they seem to be severe. and maybe you didn’t respond too well at first. But that is kind of a tough load to carry, for sure. How are you doing with it?"

176149990,I have had add since childhood but was never put on meds for it because my mum has always been very anti medications. I’ve always wanted a prescription for add meds but my pdoc won’t do it because I’ve got a history of mania and am schizoaffective.

174380475,"I agree with this entirely… Psychosis is a major ?????? when it comes to description. I’d give credit to schizophrenics for their “Willfullness of mind.” Prepsychosis it seems a trend that they won’t run from anything in thought… but have a higher propensity for social/irrational fears. I’m only speaking from my own observations… it’s that kind of person… or that overlapping major drug addictions. Normally the psyhcotic individual is more excentric and fragile and grandiose in their expectations even in prodromal phases. all the same the occurrence of full blown psychosis is something only known to a small fragment of the overall population group. It’s distribution is indiscriminate in relation to standard measures… It’s neurological though… might have a lot to do with neurochemistry first… but once the illness sets in it is a physical illness. It rewrites pathways of operation in the psyche, both conscious and subconscious. From there you have the yarn ball of what it 
is to live with psychosis after the first psychotic break… the psychotic break ranging a wide timeframe in onset… but basically the congitive capacity of the mind doubles in on itself like a failed metamorphosis. and then there you have it… the real unfair thing is that medical scientists don’t want to acknowledge the illness is legitimate at all… because certifying it’s complexity is like stripping them of their badges and credibiltiy… cause they don’t understand it. There are medical researches in academia who aren’t afraid to let it be what it is… and there are some non-profits/devote medical centers that approach the problem with genuine scientific and well intended intrigue… but the overall masses of the medical industry has already spread their limited sympathies thin with more obvious, apparent, detrimental physical diseases… cancer, muscular dystrophy… diabetes… even Alzheimers… We are fringe… one way or another… and we are low priority… but from my own experience
 We bare the heaviest of mental weights imaginable… it’s like the sense of losing an “arms worth of mind” at all times… that phrase doesn’t make sense, nor will it stick… but what would you rather lose? Your arm, or your mind? (_USER_ID_: let alone the apexual cataclysm of total distrusted amplified to the greatest of all extremes instantaneously but a hallucinatory imagination)"
174380474,Most drugs that are mood stabilizers also have antipsychotic properties and vice versa. It’s just a matter of which function it performs more effectively. And as a disclaimer: please do not lick batteries to treat schizophrenia. The lithium ion found in rechargeable batteries is different from the lithium used to treat mental illness.
174380483,It seems like my ocd is worsening on clozapine and studies agree ocd flares up in some patients on clozapine. Its hard to stop a med which had you stable for 6 years. But my ocd is very bad now. Is there any other antipsychotic as powerful as clozapine which i can try ?

176150031,I’m not a “criminal” but I am an addict (nicotine.) Important to include is I happily hand over half my monthly check to my mom. I believe people forget about the elderly and I want her to enjoy her golden years. It’s a sad confluence of things though. (I almost ran out of gas.) It starts when I ‘hide’ money from myself when I feel like I can kick the smokes; but I just end up overdrawing my account. Plus my bank is screwing people(there’s actually a class action settlement going on). And I shower my goddaughter with gifts I can’t afford. I’m 41 and the same issue that probably allows me to happily contribute to the household could be thought of as why I took the 20 dollars. And now I’m in suspense over getting caught. It’s quite amazing the ‘eptitude’ I possess in effing myself over.

I have read about clozapine and glutamate, but I’ve also read about other drugs and supplements with some effect on glutamate - like sarcosine, which may be why sarcosine doesn’t provide added benefit with clozapine. NAC is another supplement with an effect on glutamate, but it is also anti inflammatory. There is a trial of NAC and clozapine, but I don’t think it has results yet."

176150051,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/_PHONE_NO_.1666102 We are optimistic that many of the molecular targets that have emerged from the field of neuroscience will be evaluated over the next few years, yielding better treatments for patients. As predicted in a 2014 commentary, new technologies are defining disease phenotypes [ 25 _NAME_ SE. Revitalizing psychiatric therapeutics. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2014 Jan;39(1):220–229. [Crossref] , [PubMed] , [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar] ].

Even if you are wealthy satisfaction is rarely achieved. We are all in our personal hells; each distinct and personal to us. That is why the search for liberation of earthly desires is an ideal sought by many as if to free ourselves from craving, desire and earthly pleasures which often are brief and addictive. How bad our ‘hell’ is could be contingent on a spiritual practice, and how well you handle it is key, but this constant search for happiness in a universe hell bent on destroying us is hell epitomised."

For me, medications did indeed do most of the work. I stopped seeing “signs” in everything and eventually my deluded thoughts followed suit and disappeared over time. For me, medication was the key. But maybe for you , you also need to question the illogical nature of your delusion. I think it would be really good for you if you had a Pdoc and not just a nurse to offer suggestions for you to get over this delusion…but I guess you’re stuck with what you got. Oh, and to answer your question about how likely it is…it isn’t likely at all…the technology you think is being used to spy on you doesn’t exist. And even if it did, why would anyone bother to spy on you. No offence, but I doubt your life is all THAT interesting to everyone in the world."

174380494,"Hi again I’m beat these last few days. I wonde is it the lyrica but an due to talk to my psychiatrist on the 19th of this month, so I think I will percivere with the lyrica till then. Terrible cramps legs. Am on _PERSON_ for that pain and betmiga for an overactive bladder. I don’t think I am feeling any better anxious wise on the lyrica. I wonder is there a different medication my psychiatrist can try for the anxiety. I’m on edge all the time and can’t sit still. I am wondering if the abilify is doing that. I don’t want to change my medication in case I go on a downward spiral again. I would rather be restless than in bed all day with depression so bad that I was practically bedridden for two years, so I’m thankful my mood is better. Cant have it all I guess. Better to have motivation than none at all. I keep thinking I have schizophrenia or a type of it. I mean the whole thing is just so strange. I’m on two antipsychotics so am wondering why if its not the kind of treatment for somat
aform disorder. This is where I wonder. Am i being treated for just somataform disorder or is it possible my docs think it’s something more. I mean I’m not getting it. Especially the thoughts I was having were real scary and still I see things that are very weird and worrying so I will talk with my psychiatrist and ask him what’s going on with me. I’m pacing, stumbling tripping, and that groogy woozy head I hate. Hate that every day. What are the symptoms of schizophrenia? I have hallucinations and I am a bit paranoid as well. I think I have MS as well, so it’s all racing thoughts and i cant relax. I sleep ok, probably the quietapine and lyrica together knock me out. And i use CPAP, for sleep apeona as well. I’m thankful for the improvement in my mood but I’m still not sure it’s more than somataform disorder. That’s my problem, I always seem to think its MS, schizophrenia now so an I delusional. Will wait and see what my psychiatrist says in video chat on the 19th."

176150142,Is 28C in my lounge too
176150143,"My experience is that you can mostly compensate for it by not being apathetic, yes. That means living a normal life. I know how hard that can be, but in my experience, nearly all the emotional and intellectual numbness comes from the apathy."
174380505,"i paid about 800 worth of visits to a therapist. the one that gave me all the books to buy. the best thing she did was get me an appointment with a really good psychiatrist lol. when i first shared about my issues with psychosis and such, she started to well up with tears. then she takes a deep breath then said, wow that is very emotional. i told her its ok im over it im the one whos suppose to be getting therapy lol."
176150144,Tell him. Your neurotransmitters are out of balance and making you feel like dying.
176150145,"_AT_MENTION_: it made lots of sense, thanks for the try. Each man has his own perspective even though they’re handling the same elephant. We each have a unique cross to bear even tho we share the same earth. I’ll noodle w your idea, it’s on the right path… (: _AT_MENTION_: it humanizes the experience. It’s my belief that perspective helps in recovery knowing others out there may be struggling, that we are not alone even though we may feel alone."
176150146,Yeah thought about that they might come back I was smoking weed for about a year and a half then all off a sudden I started getting pariniod about evil psychics stealing my energy then thought it was my neighbors and scientology trying to kill some days with there minds and steal more of my energy then started to hear voices saying that they where god then they turned into the illuminati and and stayed that way saying that they are gonna tourture me with their minds forever cuz I smoke cigs. I beg and plead with them that I cant quit but they dont care and say it’s easy and every one did it for at least a day
176150147,Why? Was she upset?
176150148,"I wasn’t of a sound mind when i joined, tbh. I was misdiagnosed and on the wrong meds. Its fine if yall want to adhere to your rules. If you think me mentioning a lawyer is a threat, that is paranoia. Im just settling affairs in life and asked him a question."
176150149,I so get the fear of clowns!! They are pure evil!!
176150150,Having some problems with the website…interesting trying to get off page

176150155,"Sometimes I’ve laughed a lot at your jokes, _NAME_. Jokes are powerful, though. With great power comes… a whole lot of offended and vindictive people. Many good jokes go untold because of the possible repercussions. I’ve tried to learn to be very careful."
176150156,sorry to hear you mum was that vain =(
176150157,"Yes it’s possible with a lot of effort put into treatment. Being stable and being able to recover after an episode are the two keys for success. There are a lot of other ways to help people that still have stress, but a different kind. I think I mentioned patient advocacy in a previous thread. With that being said, if your heart is set on nursing then go be a nurse. The only way you’ll ever know is to try."
174380517,Meds are more effective and stronger than supplements.
176150158,That’s called imposter syndrome. A lot of people feel that way. It doesn’t mean you should stop your meds. If anything it’s a good indication you should stay on your meds.i think it’s a good indication you’re not psychotic any longer.
174380518,Is it still working out for you _AT_MENTION_ ?
176150159,"I do omad (one meal a day), i eat one huge meal worth 1800 calories and eat nothing else, well most of the time. I also cut out soda pop, well except for now, im drinking a can of coke. Have about 3 to 5 a day. I lost about 25 pounds, i weigh 185 and im 6 feet tall. Took about 3 months. Though i can tell im gaining it back since i went back on risperidone, those random hunger feelings and cravings are killer lol Its also become harder to lift weights because of the pain from injections, need to rest for like 3 days."

176150162,Try and drive safely if you can. I know how it feels to have the freedom of driving taken away for a long time.
176150163,This is the response from my community psychiatric nurse. Very honest but not helpful. I need this forum and the community here more than ever now that my mental health team have given up on me.
176150164,"I support the companies who are doing it well. One of my wife’s colleagues owned a Tesla. It spent 90% of its life in the garage getting the bits that had fallen off stuck back on. That’s when it wasn’t stranding them everywhere (oh, and by the way, a lot of tow truck drivers refuse to tow them because of their poor design). They finally gave up and bought a Chevy Volt. Not a single problem with it. My wife’s cousin just HAD to have a Tesla. Same thing. It soured them on electric vehicles to the point where they will never own another one, and they’re notorious eco virtue signallers. _NAME_ can’t go for half an hour without posting on social media about Impossible Foods or the latest brick of tofu she’s purchased. We howled over all the problems they posted about their Tesla. Probably because they spent the year before the purchase bragging it up. We’ll definitely consider purchasing an EV when the tech matures a bit more. We don’t have a pressing need at present. Here’s my own

176150166,"Hey there, you arent a bad person for such a small mistake! There is no harm done. No bad intent. I understand though…i f.e. had thoughts that i would go to hell for picking flowers (= killing them)…or many other such thoughts. No voices. I dont know how they go away, but just: hugs…i hope you can find ways to challenge these thoughts. Maybe can you see examples from the past when they were clearly wrong?"
176150167,Deceitful scary intense
176150168,Thank you _AT_MENTION_
176150169,"I will tell you about the first girl I dated, she was Moorish, ok maybe not the first, but at any rate her mother was Spanish, she went out with Jeshua(_NAME_) and is a teacher now as far as I know, we broke up because at her father’s house I said after we had been dating for some time “we could go out if you like” just like school :(…"

I just keep thinking I should be losing faster but I know it wouldn’t be healthy. If anyone else is going to try slimfast do yourself a favor and only get the chocolate flavor. You can taste the vitamins in the other flavors and it makes it hard to get down. But chocolate is just like chocolate milk. I have 3 cases of vanilla and I’m not looking forward to having to drink them, but it’s expensive so I will."

176150202,Thanks I will tell her tomorrow
176150203,They said sza last 5 years
176150204,There’s a test to see if you’re comfortable around people with mental illness?
176150205,"Honey I’m so sorry you are struggling. I would want to go to the hospital if I had attempted suicide. I would want the safety. I would be so scared and want the safety and comfort of the hospital environment so I could work through my problems, get some coping skills and mostly get my meds right. The one good thing about the hospital is they can make meds changes quickly because you are right there where they can evaluate you and see what the meds are doing."
176150206,I need to eat more.
176150207,"It’s kind of a misnomer, IMO. Has to do with a joining of reality and the dream state. Normal people have a healthy split between the two, so technically they are the schizophrenics. Schizophrenics should be called “iungo”- (latin for joined) phrenics."
176150208,"I have had very similar Vision type dreams, mostly when I was in a coma. They were extremely Spiritual, and very archetypal, just as you describe. When I described them to a guy I used to work with, the first thing he said was “You met your Animus”. This is a term that _NAME_ used to describe Collective Consciousness, or higher reality I don’t have them anymore, to be honest I wish I did. I never felt more alive when I came out of the coma, even though I was paralyzed from the neck down As far as the medication issue is concerned, tread carefully. If you decide you really want to do it, which I’m not sure I can recommend, wean down slowly and be alert for any changes in mood and other symptoms. Modern medication can really wind its way into your brain chemistry, and withdrawal can be quite intense. As others have warned, this can create quite a tragic crash"
176150209,"Hmmm, good question, _AT_MENTION_. When everything was first going down, I believed the voices were separate entities. Now that I’m on meds, I’ve been rationalizing that experience: I heard a lot of big words when I was away at university, so perhaps that was one that I was introduced to. It really depends on the day. Sometimes they’re so separate from me… They amaze me sometimes. But, I have to say that it’s a lot healthier believing that they’re just a part of the subconscious, though."
176150210,I can’t believe I used to listen to them so much. Well I can believe it I was scared shirtless but still it was sooo much of my Time like whole days and nights… My gosh
176150211,This disease on its own is frustrating. I can get frustrated when people refuse to believe their delusions aren’t real and then I get mad at myself for it because I’ve had my own obstacles to get over and accept.
176150212,"You seem to post about your parents a lot, have you talked to a therapist about your obsessions with the past?"

174380529,I take 15mg. It messed with my blood sugar so I have to take metformin now along with it. It was the best med for me.
174380528,It’s easy for someone without schizophrenia to recommend some thing that is hard for a disabled person to do.
176150216,"We can hear song in our mind, same like that we can visualize pictures in our mind, also we can think about a thought or idea even if its true or false. These most of us can do. But what makes hallucination in some either auditory or visual is these individuals can’t distinguish whether its real or not. Same way thoughts or ideas (delusions), individual can’t distinguish whether its true or not. In normal people they know that its made by them or coming automatically like some times and when they dream. Thus they can quickly disregard it even if the theme is negative. But when the individual loss the ability to distinguish whether its real or not they start to respond to it and this is how issues start due to it."

I also am currently dealing with the belief that news anchors are communicating with me through the TV. Apparently, I’m supposed to be president or some form of prophet for the LDS Church. Everyday is a challenge. I wake up hoping the previous day was a bad dream and then I open YouTube and it’s like the anchors are staring right at me.

176150244,"I gained five kg since moving interstate and I exercise four times a week (yoga included) and I don’t think I should eat less specially since I’m a vegan. Admittedly I treat myself to a vegan icecream on the weekends but otherwise I have not been having cakes, biscuits and not even bread but still these five kg stubbornly remain. I would probably like to lose eight kg or so but only in a healthy way. I am about 160cm and approximately 60kg so I have a normal bmi but I’ve gained weight from what I normally was. I was 74 kg on olanzapine but I’m on latuda now. I want to lose weight but in a healthy way and I am not prepared to eat less than I’m eating now. I think it would be unhealthy to eat less. I stopped buying vegan pancakes I miss them but I thought they may make me gain weight. I don’t want to have smaller portions but that is the way I could lose weight . I don’t eat huge amounts. I think I eat healthy. Maybe I should see a dietitian."
176150245,"Thanks, _AT_MENTION_. You’re awesome too hon!"
176150246,I?ll talk to my pdoc about it.

176150250,She asked when I am coming back. I have been scared of going back to work since the lockdown began. The anxiety is so bad and I have been struggling with the guilt of feeling like my colleagues were trying to get rid of me. And then telling my manager I think this. But I also told her I know this is not true but I am feeling very paranoid. I told this to my colleague she said I need not feel guilty about feeling sick… and that my colleagues are asking how I am and want for me to go back… This tells me something: I don’t want to quit this job. I want to go back. It will be hard to get there but once I am there I will realise I have nothing to feel scared about. I can’t keep quitting jobs and running forever.

174380545,What meds and dosage are you on? I’m on 25mg of Abilify and I think it is too high. It was reduced in the past but then I relapsed so I’m too afraid to try and lower dosage again.

174380543,"I spoke to the professor in the article personally…he is in no way hiding that it can be a severe problem. I think i remember (not sure) he actually had sz in his own family. He just argues, among other things, that there isnt this one solide thing called sz, but there are psychotic symptoms on a spectrum (from very mild to very severe), with all sorts of causes or mixes of causes, and different outcome possibilities and best treatment options. Some people will be better helped with meds, other with trauma therapy, yet other with something else. He thinks the hopeless attitude and _USER_ID_ around sz is hurting people. And he fights a lot for good care for people here. So there are chances for better lives. Sorry if i sound temperamental, it is enthusiasm about what i see he tries to do here (in my country), not meanness."
176150275,Yes pcos has some connections with insulin sensitivity but idk wat.

176150286,"I’m having an attack of disordered thoughts (intrusive, involuntary) I’m aware that I’m thinking, and the content of my thoughts are stupidly that I’m aware that I’m thinking about thinking etc. It’s quite annoying. I think the reason to (my) thought disorder is emptiness, lack of self (hood.) Usually I’m in a flow of thoughts, like the rest of us. I don’t notice. I am my thoughts. Suddenly the flow stops, and my thoughts want to come back on “the tracks” back in the flow but are for a moment lost in thoughts about thoughts and the inevitable intrusive thoughts that take advantage, fill the emptiness and say. “pull your self together and kill yourself” “no i want, stupid …” “don’t call me a stupid …” Bla. bla, bla. i’m not sucidal at all and not frightened, im just bothered."

176150289,Thank you for saying that
176150290,How long before y’all think this is gonna blow over?
176150291,"Nice day at work. We had an hour before we got off work and the boss was talking to my co-worker. The poor guy is having big problems and I feel sorry for him but he’s a complainer and talks behind peoples back. But the boss is right, he’s 48 but he’s becoming very frail and not doing well so I always cut him some slack. I heard the conversation and walked in to listen and got to hear the boss _USER_ID_ things around and pretty much diss us and turned a nice conversation about life into telling us her problems and using the fact that me and the other guy come in late sometimes and tell me us that we are easily replaceable and that she has to look out for herself and pretty much ignoring the fact we’ve both been there 5 years and worked for her for more than a year. It was a pretty cold thing to do. I guess the thing that bugged me most was I thought it was a friendly conversation so I let my guard down and she twisted the knives in our backs. The company we work for hires disabled people an
d we share a tiny office and we have barbeques and we all have problems and I just thought we meant a little more than that. But I’ve worked many jobs without special treatment so I see the reality of the situation but I still think it was a pretty cold thing to do. She was trying to distance herself from us. It was a bummer. Then I went to help clean restrooms with the two temps and my direct supervisor. I had no beef with the older woman until she started going temporarily crazy and started babbling and double-talking. I think she was pulling some control trip and I tried to be nice but when she started on me and she was being manipulative and not making sense and the other two guys were laughing at her efforts to control what was happening I got a little mad. It was earlier today but I still don’t know what her trip was, the boss told us what to do pretty clearly but she wanted to muddle the issue and babble. I know about people in real life and I know the new guy was going to try to take control so I 
just faced him about it and he gave up. Apparently he was bugging the woman though. I just wanted to get the hell out of there and go home. These aren’t terrible people but everybody has their trip and most people are manipulative and control freaks and even at the level of being a janitor they will force their trip on other people. I made it through with pride intact while still standing up for myself but I was so happy to get out of there today. It’s the weekend now!"
174380549,"It comes with the schizophrenia. I imagine the people that hate me / targeted me are mostly sociopaths or psychopaths. People that possibly ruined my life in 2011 and gave me schizophrenia. Because of the confusion, I’m not sure if it happened in this life or my past lives. I imagine they hate me talking about time travel, aliens, and conspiracy theories. I imagine the school I went to hates me. I will never go back. Not sure what happened but it’s been 8 years and I try to recover my memories, heal, and figure it out. I’m in a causal loop or time loop. No one deserves this. I think it’s because I was in monarch program or Montauk project. I was _NAME_ in a past life. And I posted I time traveled from marijuana on facebook in 2011. I was severely targeted by corrupt people working for the government or college students. I may have been abducted by grey aliens but don’t know why. I think I was sexually abused… My memory sucks. I have false or implanted memories or possibly delusions. I h
ave severe paranoia, and fear because I was tortured and killed in my past lives. I feel like I talk to much ???? and they don’t want me talking. Therapy doesn’t help because they say it’s all in my head. It’s hard because I’ve been to other dimensions and parallel universes. Military abductions or something…because I’m an extraterrestrial or was taken aboard by extraterrestrials. Stuff happened to me in the mental hospital too in my past lives. Maybe because I talked about simulation theory. I used to be a time traveler. I might have a photographic memory for past lives. They should spend the rest of their lives behind bars. It probably involves several people. It’s a conspiracy. I was also targeted by greys/EBENs. Not sure why. I think it’s deep black military doing this to me. In a past life, I was taken to an underground base with a reptilian. Not sure where. I think I died. My family died before in a past life a lot. I’m scared. I know they uploaded my mind to a computer and keep send
ing me back to 2013 as a very sick, dissociated schizophrenic. I’m in a never ending loop trying to heal. I wish I could go back to my childhood. My mind doesn’t get fully wiped so that’s probably why. I feel like I’m an unfortunate case with really bad luck."
174380548,"Perhaps a head injury. I think you are trying to escape guilt with your insistence that it is not anything you can help. And you don’t want to get well. For some reason, you are getting your kicks out of your bed routine."

176150293,"But seriously, the partner thing is a real bummer for me. I have some specific needs and wishes, and most people I’ve been with haven’t been able to respect those. I feel like finding a partner who respects me for who I am, not who I could be, is really, really hard."

176150297,"I came off Olanzapine 20mg in 2015. I tried cold turkey, and it made me feel very sick from withdrawals. They then tried Aripiprazole, but that didn’t work for me and I had a relapse. Mirtazapine I refused to even take, as with Olanzapine, a side effect of weight gain is unacceptable to me I do not want to be made overweight and get complications from diabetes etc"
174380554,Yeah. I use it all the time. I didn’t pick it but it’s stuck. I think it’s easier for diagnosis and most people think you’ve multiple personalities. Still. I admire your moxy but to me I use it when needed. I’m a paranoid schizophrenic. People often laugh at the paranoid. People are so weird!

On the downside, once I woke up and had to pee so bad, but it was so dark I found myself “stuck” at this wall, and couldn’t figure out where I was, nor the light switch. Happy ending though, I crawled on the floor until I found the bathroom, in time of course."

I got to get used to the fact that I have an effect on other people. It sounds obvious but it’s a concept I have to learn even at this impossibly late stage in my life. I want people to see me and I want people to care what I’m thinking. I want to say honestly what’s on my mind. I want people to see me and see my personality sometimes. I think of interesting stuff all the time. If someone happens to care how I’m feeling that’s just a bonus, it’s something I’m not used to but it’s nice."

176150365,"Hey, I’m super nervous to be writing this so bear with me a i guess. Im a 15 year old girl and I’ve been questioning my mental state for a couple of years now? I really dont know what to do since I come from a low income family where we live paycheck to paycheck in a stressful environment. I haven’t had an appointment with a psychiatric doctor ever, but my family has history of diagnosed mental illnesses, so that kinda scares me. I don’t take medication but i have been diagnosed with ADHD and I used to take adderall up until a few years ago when i stopped by choice. I have an internal battle with myself and the most extreme question: am i medium who can speak to ghosts? I used to believe that was the most logical answer as a child, but now i don’t know. I see their shadows, even full apparitions of them if im unlucky, sometimes “hear” them. By hear them I mean they speak to me i guess telepathically with them. What they say pops into my mind and I used to think i could respond, but it 
never really worked. I also have anxiety that people can read my mind. I mean, if a ghost could, why not a human? But then that reasonable part of my brain tells me that’s not possible because they’re human. I have an extreme fear of bugs and whenever im near one I feel like I have some crawling on me. I blame this on anxiety attacks. I blame all of my issues on anxiety attacks, actually. Ive never told anyone my fears. My family believes i am a medium but they dont know my thoughts on it. I also have other more triggering fears that scare me out of my wits that i blame on intrusive thoughts. I rather not share them openly as i dont want anyone to be triggered by them, but if people want to know I can share them in the comments. I can also share more about my past as I think some of the things couldve possibly been a cause to this, but they can be triggering and I don’t want to just throw them out there. I can put them in the comments if people are comfortable with it. I had extreme _NAME_ while typing 
that last bit specifically, and ive always been told that _NAME_ is the sign you’re on the right path in life, so maybe this is good. Hopefully i can find guidance on here. If not, thank you anyway. Don’t be afraid to tell me the honest truth. I just want help, I’m not here to attention seek. I also hope everyone on here finds the help they need, cause I read a few posts before I built up the courage to write this. Sorry for typing so much."

I’ve also had the more terrifying dream where you’re on the 30th floor or something, and you watch the giant walk by, and turn and look directly at you, then rip the top off the building and try to grab you, followed by a scene of escaping an exploding/ hand smashed building as giant fingers come in to squish you. Luckily, no matter how terrified I was in dreams like this, I could always remember how insanely amazing the visuals and concept ended up being, like when I had to go supersaijan to fight one off.

rk out. When I inquired about rotc in college I was looking into intelligence. Not sure why. But I didn’t want to just fight. I wanted to do something cool, I guess.

I really liked JAG too (law) and always thought engineering corps was cool like civil engineering or combat medic/combat engineer (I played those roles in video games all the time) (those were my favorites). I think the military does good. I like the fact that they will pay for your schooling. So you could be a dentist or doctor eventually. I would have done that – been a surgeon. But schizophrenia has changed me. I would have never liked psych before schizophrenia. I wouldn’t feel comfortable flying a multi-million dollar machine. I always thought being a pilot was the best thing about the military though. Like imagine flying a f-22 or f-35 or stealth bombe
r and stuff. I gave up on that though. I never felt comfortable. I had depression growing up and I always felt insecure about my intelligence. I was never into helicopters though."

174380558,"Verywell Health What Are NMDA Receptors & What Is Their Role in Disease? Learn about NMDA receptors, what they do in your brain, what illnesses they're involved with, and what treatments target them. You may have heard of NMDA receptors while learning about a disease or medication, but do you understand what they are and why they are important? First, it helps to understand what we mean by receptor. In your brain, you’ve got a bunch of cells called neurons. These are the cells that send and receive the electrical impulses that control your body. Neurons are specialized—each one only deals with certain types of information. So, for example, one neuron may process information on pain and temperature but have nothing to do with visual perception or learning new information. The chemicals that send information from neuron to neuron are called neurotransmitters. Some of the better-known ones include serotonin and dopamine. Neurotransmitters specialize in certain types of information, as well. For in
stance, serotonin is involved in the sleep cycle, while dopamine deals with movement and addiction. For a neurotransmitter to move signals through a neuron, it first has to “unlock” it. That’s where receptors come in. Think of receptors as boat slips or ports on your computer. Not every boat fits in every slip, and not every cable fits in every port. Neurotransmitters have keys that open the locks on a neuron’s receptors, and that allows information to flow through your neurons. What NMDA Receptors Do NMDA stands for N -methyl-D-aspartate, which describes the chemical make-up of the receptors. NMDA receptors are involved in a lot of important processes in your brain. They’re also believed to be involved in numerous illnesses involving the brain, and they’re the targets of certain prescription drugs. NMDA receptors are a critical part of what’s called neuroplasticity, which basically means how malleable and adaptable our brains are—how able they are to learn new information, which means forming 
new pathways between neurons. In addition to learning new things, plasticity allows your brain to form new pathways when old ones are destroyed, such as by injury or disease. As we age, our NMDA receptors naturally become less and less functional. Research suggests that this drop in activity is part of the age-related decline in plasticity, which causes memory impairment and a decreased ability to learn. NMDA receptors are also one of a few receptors that process opiate/opioid painkillers in our brains. NMDA Receptors and Neurotransmitters NMDA receptors can be activated (unlocked) by binding with an assortment of neurotransmitters, including: Glutamate Aspartate Glycine D-serine NMDA receptors work with these neurotransmitters to rev up activity in areas of your brain that help you learn new information and form memories. They stimulate and “excite” the neurons. That’s a good thing, but only up to a point. If the neurons stay in an excited state for too long, they can become overstimulated and start to 
function poorly. Eventually, they become so overexcited that they die. That kind of overstimulation is called “excitotoxicity.” Glutamate and aspartate, in excess, are both classified as excitotoxins. To keep excitotoxicity from killing our brain cells, we also have neurotransmitters that calm the neurons. They’re called inhibitors. Glycine, another one of the brain chemicals that bind with NMDA receptors, is an inhibitor in the spinal cord but is believed to be excitatory in the brain. When our brains are healthy and functioning properly, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters are generally able to keep things in balance so our neurons aren’t in jeopardy of overstimulation. However, when things aren’t working properly—i.e., a receptor is malfunctioning or neurotransmitter levels are out of balance—then we may start losing neurons to excitotoxicity. Our bodies can’t make new neurons, so when they die, we’ve lost irreplaceable parts of our brains. It’s no surprise, then, that NMDA rece
ptor problems are believed to be involved in a wide variety of central nervous system conditions, including many that are neurodegenerative. Illnesses Linked to NMDA Receptor Malfunction Neurodegenerative diseases believed to be linked to NMDA receptors malfunction include: Alzheimer’s disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Huntington’s disease Parkinson’s disease Epilepsy Other central nervous system conditions with suspected NMDA receptor involvement include: Fibromyalgia Chronic fatigue syndrome Migraine aura Some types of headache Anxiety Depression Schizophrenia Post-traumatic stress disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Some conditions that don’t involve NMDA receptor dysfunction may benefit from drugs that target NMDARs, such as: Phobia Stroke Pain from damaged nerves (neuropathy) In phobias, NMDA receptor stimulating drugs are believed to help the _USER_ID_ (a part of the brain that deals with fear) re-learn new associations that help counter the fear. In strokes, research suggests that 
inhibiting glutamate via NMDA receptors may help decrease damage to brain cells caused by lack of oxygen. In neuropathic pain, these drugs may help boost the effect of painkillers due to their involvement with the opioid pathways. Treatments Targeting NMDA Receptors Brain chemistry is a tricky thing, and throwing it out of whack can be extremely dangerous. Even if it seems logical that something could help with your symptoms, it’s crucial that you talk to a doctor before trying anything that alters NMDA receptor function (or other aspects of how your brain works). Many drugs and supplements are believed to alter the function of NMDA receptors. They come in two opposite forms: antagonists and agonists. NMDA Receptor Antagonists You’re probably more familiar with the term “antagonist” when it refers to the villain of a story—the character who tries to slow down or block the hero from accomplishing his or her goals. In the medical sense, antagonists are drugs that slow or block things. In the case of N
MDA receptors, antagonists inhibit reception, meaning that they block neurotransmitters from unlocking these receptors. Many neurodegenerative diseases and other central nervous system disorders are sometimes treated with these types of medications. Drugs that are classified as NMDA receptor antagonists include: Namenda (memantine) Ketamine Chloroform High doses of dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant in Mucinex, Robitussin, NyQuil and many other over-the-counter drugs) Strattera (atomoxetine) Symmetrel (amantadine) Supplements in this category include: Agmatine Arginine Huperzine A Zinc NMDA Receptor Agonists An “agonist” is the opposite of an antagonist; it stimulates or increases activity. NMDA receptor agonists make it easier for neurotransmitters to access these receptors and increase the flow of information through the brain. These drugs are sometimes used to treat mood and mental disorders, including schizophrenia and suicidal thoughts. Some pharmaceutical NMDA receptor agonists are: Clozaril (clo
zapine) Seromycin (cycloserine) Additionally, several experimental NMDA receptor agonists are undergoing clinical trials for depression. Supplements that are NMDA receptor agonists include: Aspartic acid DHEA Theanine A Word From Verywell Knowing about NMDA receptors may help you gain a better understanding of your illness and possible treatments for it. Keep in mind that these receptors are part of an incredibly complex system—the human brain is one of the most complex systems that exist. Only a doctor can properly diagnose and treat conditions that involve things like receptors and neurotransmitters. It’s common to think that supplements are “safe” treatments, but even natural substances can cause negative side effects and interact poorly with medications. Involve your doctor and pharmacist in your treatment decisions to make sure you’re not harming yourself as you try to get better."

176150472,It’s very weird.
176150473,Hopefully you are feeling better by now _AT_MENTION_
176150474,I have lofty dreams and short term dreams. I can’t even get to the short-term ones. I need to learn some kind of skill that will yield $13k CAD so I can progress with e-commerce. Can’t even do that.
176150475,Gorgeous photos! Love them!
176150476,_AT_MENTION_ How is your depression this week?
176150477,"Its so much fun, missions are so cool. I found some good players on my team with great weapons and abilities, im beasting every mission, i almost unlock every ability. Its so addicting and fun, you guys should get it if you have the chance."
176150478,I feel like that when walking about in town nowadays
176150479,"Yes i take two. Ziprasidone 80 mg in total, and Clozapine 325 mg. Works well for me."
176150480,"I’ve been through situations like this before, so it’s a mystery why I can’t keep my composure lately. Does anyone here have a hard time with emotional regulation sometimes?"
176150481,"I’m afraid of demons at night too, freaks me out when I wake up at night"
174380576,"No! Believe it or not, years ago there was a thread Header entitled… “My Husband Got Pissy All Over Me” (She meant to write that her husband got angry, but it came across as very kinky.) It was something like that anyways, and we all had a big laugh!"
176150482,Has anybody here seen real people as a hallucination and interact with them? Because I don’t know if a had a real conversation with a person I meet or if it was a hallucination.
176150483,"I have never been diagnosed, but have ADD-ish traits. Not sure they were inborn though. I can either be totally sucked into something (hyperfocus), in which case i forget the rest of the world. Or im inattentive. There is little in between. I forget and lose stuff and all executive functions are poor. Im dreamy. I cant oversee things, there is loads of overwhelming detail. Impuls control is poor. I get into trouble and was a thrillseeker. Im ALSO sensitive, open to new experiences, flexible, etc. This is ALSO part of the deal imho. It isnt (just) an illness. I just function differently. I do not wish to be medicated, though i considered it."
174380580,lol that sounds like ?????? up pdoc =D
176150484,I had invega… maybe thats why…
176150485,"My Mom thought she knew all about why I got fired. It was the illness, nothing else. She thought I had quit taking my meds and that it was all my fault. She wouldn’t listen to me or give me a break."
176150486,I felt like that the other day. I felt like planning on quitting two months earlier than I was meant to (that wasn’t then but later ahead in the future) . Its so tempting but I decided no. I need to see if I can settle OK on these meds for the chance of a future relapse and plus I was told my risk of relapse would increase if going off two months earlier than planned
176150487,I agree with you. You should watch Gremlins. Hilarious.
176150488,This That Real Hip Hop? I agree its your best work yet but yeah probably a little too much for here lol. Definitely go to r/makinghiphip or r/wearethemusicmakers or something I think theyll appreciate it
176150489,Maybe you need to cut back on your meds?
176150490,I hope the new meds help you like they’re supposed to. You’re sure right about schizophrenia though now that I’m older my schizophrenia isn’t as bad. I wish you good luck.

176150493,"I love bacon and cheese fries, have you cheese from wendys there awesome."
176150494,"I think premade tupperware meals are a really great option. That way you can control your macros (carb, fat, and protein) intake. Its easy to make like 20 meals and put them in the freezer and just defrost them at set meal times. Then perhaps just choose various snacks to fall back on if there is hunger between meals?"
176150495,"Im on Lurasidone/Latuda. I asked it to be prescribed to me specifically after being on quetiapine/seroquel and hating it. Its overall possibly the best antipsychotic I’ve been on in terms of side effects. The only real negative is that eating it with food (which you MUST do) is really confusing if you go out for dinner, or spend a night out with friends etc. You essentially have to eat twice or miss the medication."
176150496,I am overweight and I’d like to eat healthier. Incorporating more fruits and veggies into my diet. I definitely have to eat less bread. I love bread!

176150502,"My son in law who wrecked a car when he was a teen, but that was when he was first driving. He’s a good driver now I think. I keep telling myself they will be fine, but the anxiety wells up. There is so much that can happen on an 8 hour drive. I hate the distance. I hate the highway. I just need to stop thinking about it now."
176150503,Alright. I suppose I can try it out your way. I wonder why these companies don’t make them instead over dose
176150504,"i dun understand what u mean and i think u din get what i want to say,i am not intetested if i can glaring at them,or if they are glaring at me. i just can’t catch the gaze from other people , neither i can look back to them , i can’t interpret the message “when” we are looking into each other"

176150515,I just hear voices and have some depression while on meds.

176150516,"Brit Here.I like the uk. Its given me a house for life and a decent benefit income. Im not too keen on the larger cities tho. My seaside town is nice and quiet for me most of the time.

176150526,What should we do? Turn it off for ever?

176150533,"PTSD can cause flashbacks of traumatic events, which are jarring and interfere with the ability to live your life. Those are bad and therapy can help. Social anxiety can cause an obsession with replaying conversations and looking for mistakes you made. Therapy can help with these, too. But if you’re just daydreaming about past events and thinking of different ways it could have gone, that’s just how we process the events of our lives, and heal from embarrassments."
176150534,I got a lot more work done when I didn’t.
176150535,I did when I was in grade school. I couldn’t draw worth a damn. I’m pretty sure I can’t now.
176150536,"Haha - Yeah ill give you that. i can be an absolute piss-artist. It got worse when i stopped work years ago, and ive grown up in a culture where all my mates and social life, revolved around the bar. The break up in my marriage, sent me to the bottle as well. Im getting better at it tho - when i relapse i drink far less than i used too."

176150546,Every job I have had since getting out of the military has been a lot harder and way more stressful on my brain. Does anyone know of easier jobs that pay ok that people enjoy?..I didn’t like working at a grocery store. I do Door Dash and it is pretty good but have to spend a lot of money on gas. I was wondering peoples thoughts on this and if they like their jobs.
176150547,I?ve never needed to change or up meds for psychosis but I?ve only been medicated for a year. If it were up to me I would be on a much higher dose.
176150548,my mindset changed… before i thought all people were bad and could do nothing good but now i feel like people are inherently bad but they try to do good… so i see more the good things in people. So i think it changed for the better…

176150550,"Everyone’s got a past-- we’ve all got some regrets. It just sucks that yours are on record.

176150555,"I understand, i hope i can still drive, I take doxepin for sleep but i dont drive after i take those at night obviously its dangerous, i told my pdoc to put that on the letter. I hope i dont lose my driving privileges. I’ll pray to god, i been driving since but i never reported it, i been fine, i just drive in the day time, i dont drive far, just to the store, doctors visit and the gym thats all."
176150556,"So, I need hope now… My doc said to stop switching my ap, but I am on it since three years… I saw a friend today at my house, but I was feeling lower than her a bit tbh… She is on meds too, but she goes out all the time etc and has some life… Me, I feel weak and shaky now, but maybe its true, that the meds can help me after years (my doc says something like this)? Does my doc lie to me? Is it possible that i’ll need something like two more years for example in addition to my efforts? For the moment, I experience badly the side effects of the Zyprexa, but before, I even wasn’t feeling it… It looks that you don’t feel the meds when you are in very bad mental state… But for the moment, I see no results on my mental, but maybe i’ll really need more time? Some others here who were like this? I tried all the other possible aps here, they were 11 and this was too much too… I guess my thinking is just screwed up by dark and desperate thoughts, introverted thoughts too… I know some r

176150557,Yeah its odd for sure its like a movie on autopilot playing in your head.

176150562,I have bipolar tendencies with sz so technically having an antidepressant and antipsychotic works for me.
176150563,_AT_MENTION_ Please don’t cut or harm yourself. You will regret it later. Make sure you contact your pdoc if the urge continues. Try to settle down and regroup.
176150564,I’m thinking of doing some volunteer work or a little side job work. It would be best for me to do that.
176150565,Really my day has been both rough and good. My work day has been good and productive but I’m having a lot of delusional thoughts. My husband is out of town for work and my kids are teens so I’ve been alone a lot. I think that’s made it worse. It’s just hard to focus on important stuff when you keep having delusions slip in. I am happy that I can identify them as incorrect thinking.
176150566,"Well you have to get this sorted. It’s not good to think like that. It would be a crap world if we all watched you. It’s a delusion, you have schizophrenia and that’s a symptom of schizophrenia."

176150569,It was just making me more anxious. I also had a terrible hangover from it. It would take me hours to feel human when I woke up. But I was addicted to it.

176150579,"You’re not the one choosing to dwell, your brain is spamming you without awareness that it bothers you. Every time I catch my mind going to past negative ( about 90% of the time ), my go to is “that’s the organ in my head doing it.” So far, this acknowledgment slowly makes me better at identifying and dismissing my spam."

176150584,sad to hear that i hope you better years in future. My teenage years where pretty good.
176150585,Sir _PERSON_ in Therapy
176150586,You can’t completely avoid thinking about the past or the future but if it’s distressing to you just concentrate on the day-to-day stuff for a while. Take a break from the past and future and deal with things 24 hours at a time for now. Other than that I agree with what _AT_MENTION_ said.
176150587,Did you talk about how you think you’re going to hell?
176150588,No they’re not. You keep thinking your dr will give you the wrong drug and that your parents want to poison you
176150589,"Thanks to a suggestion from a friend here, I checked into a mental health center. HOWEVER, I’m now starting to become aware of becoming increasingly forgetful, having poor judgement, and making bad and impulsive decisions. I feel like I’m just too NUTTY to be treated I’M NOT TREATED YET THOUGH."

It is good you write here, one day I would like to visit Israel, maybe that day never comes, I ride my bicycle a lot, but the weather is going to cool down in this coming week.

176150593,I’m at the 24 hour grocery parking lot. My car lessens my anxiety a lot. More than in the house. It’s more my neighbors setting them off than the fireworks themselves. Don’t ask. No one understands it.
176150594,While not really a “craft” it is a hobby of mine. I’ve been working on my own table top roleplaying game. It’s story base is Angels fighting away evil and demons.
176150595,I’m fine with friendly teasing but I think mean-spirited teasing I got from others when I was a kid has had a lot to do with the issues I struggle with today.

176150599,But you do have plans.

176150601,I’m using an app called My Therapy to nag me about meds. Works well!
176150602,"Woke up feeling so defeated from yesterday. My dog didn’t want to come inside. So i had to bring him in by force. By that time I shed a lot of blood due to menstruation so I became very ill. I slept until 2pm. I woke up, had a small grain drink thingy (Korean grain and milk drink) but continued to spiral into self hatred. Thought about self harm but didn’t do so And then the self hatred exploded and I started to slam the keyboards and swore at myself in anger. I continued to shed a lot of blood so I had to take iron pills and was coughing. I passed out and slept. I woke up feeling defeated. I’m feeling really dizzy and ill and dehydrated and worn out I just want life to take its course on me now. I’m exhausted. Now i am going to sleep while defeated."
174380607,"I’m on a low dose to maintain me, 200 mg i got my shot today, side effects are not bad on it, i sleep a bit other than that I find it to be a good med. I had to fight to get to 200, they said I needed 400, but it made me sleep to much.

174380612,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Beliefs about voices and their relation to severity of psychosis in chronic schizophrenia patients. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Deep, _PERSON_ and A Garg, Indian journal of psychiatry , Sep-Oct 2019 Auditory hallucinations may persist in a subset of chronic psychotic patients in spite of treatment. It is important to understand the personal meaning and significance of voices in these patients. In spite of its relevance, only a limited literature is available.This exploratory study aimed to assess the beliefs regarding voices in treatment-seeking patients with chronic schizophrenia having persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) and assess their relation to the severity of psychosis.We recruited thirty adult patients with chronic schizophrenia as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition with both lifetime and current significant AVHs (?50% days/month). Co-occurring psychiatric disorders were ruled out using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric I
nterview-7.0.0. Patients were assessed using a semi-structured proforma, Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R), Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH)-severity.The median age of the patients was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23.8-40.5). The median duration of illness and treatment was 7 years (IQR: 3.4-15.0) and 3 years (IQR: 1.9-10.5), respectively. Higher BAVQ-R scores were found on ""malevolence,"" ""omnipotence,"" and ""emotional and behavioral resistance."" These beliefs had a significant positive correlation with PSYRATS hallucination subscale, but not with the severity of psychosis (SAPS, SANS, and CGI-SCH). The sample had lower scores for ""benevolence"" and ""engagement"" subscales of BAV-Q.Overall, the study sample believed AVH to be more malicious and omnipotent rather than benevolent, and resisted the voices, enga
ging only minimally with them. These beliefs were not related to the severity of psychosis, but were related to the severity of hallucinations. Assessing the beliefs regarding AVH in larger, diverse samples may help to plan behavioral interventions."

176150621,"Okay, I am going to do my rant again. Welfare programs are NOT charity. They were designed to be the absolute bare minimum that will keep the lower class from revolting because society is built to disadvantage them. Keeping you paid means that you are not stealing from others to survive, but it also means that you and others like you won’t start a revolution and overthrow those in power. The people at the top hand out scraps to pacify the underclass so they can remain in power. What is happening in America right now is a direct result of the lower class not having enough for basic survival. Nobody tried to start a revolution when we all had jobs. Nobody tried to start a revolution when we weren’t dying en masse because of lack of access to proper healthcare. What happened in Syria was a result of many things, but one of the top problems was that the lower classes did not have enough to survive. People don’t go joining militias when they have enough to eat and a safe, warm place to sleep. Peop
le don’t risk their lives unless they have more to gain than they have to lose. Other countries see this. Other countries know that providing welfare programs to the lower class keeps the whole society running smoothly. You might not be producing monetary labor, but you take the money you earn and you spend it on things. That stimulates the economy. That creates jobs. You use the healthcare system and create jobs for doctors and nurses and sanitation staff and record-keepers. By continuing to participate in society, you create wealth for others. TLDR: Your value to society cannot be measured by the amount of labor you produce for monetary gain. If this is too political, go ahead and delete it, other mods. I just hate when people who get subsidies think they do nothing to earn that money."

MR _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta medica Iranica , 2015 Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene have already shown beneficial effects on negative, positive and general psychopathology symptoms in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia. The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the efficacy of raloxifene as an adjuvant agent in the treatment of men with chronic schizophrenia in an 8-week double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. In a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, forty-six male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR), were randomized to either raloxifene (120 mg/day) or placebo in addition to risperidone (6 mg/day) for eight weeks. The assessment was performed using the positive and negative 
symptom scale (PANSS) at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. Extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and _NAME_ depression rating scale (HDRS) at baseline and week 8 were also used to assess extrapyramidal symptoms and depression simultaneously. Forty-two patients completed the trial. The raloxifene group showed significantly greater improvement on the negative subscale (P<0.001), the general psychopathology subscale (P=0.002) and total PANSS score (P<0.001) in comparison to the placebo group at the endpoint. There was no significant difference in the reduction of positive symptoms score between the two group (P=0.525). Extrapyramidal symptom rating scale and _NAME_ depression rating scale and frequency of other adverse effects were comparable between two groups.This study indicates raloxifene as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for chronic schizophrenia in men."

What’s awkward is the ladies behind the counter. They can greet me with a forced smile and don’t even say goodbye sometimes. I think they heard gossip that I’m sz and they don’t know how to handle that. So yes I do feel a bit embarrassed as far as the counter ladies is concerned but I’m very comfortable with the pharmacists. My previous pharmacy was a horror. There was this one pharmacist who always, very rudely, told me Abilify is unobtainable. He made me felt like trash. I told my psychiatrist about the unobtainable Abilify. She made a few phonecalls and said that it was utter crap. Abilify was available. The story came out that the pharmacy had a scratch with the Abilify supplier and that it is why it was supposedly unobtainable. I stayed in a commune at the time. I always collected my meds myself. So one day the
y drop the unobtainable Abilify by courier at the landlords wife and she brought the packet of Abilify to me. I was furious cause no one at the commune knew I had sz. I then changed to a big pharmacy where I was just a number and had no problems."

174380652,"I remember once before I was using any antipsychotic medication, I was raving and hearing a lot of voices. I took a lot of l-theanine that day and the voices disappeared. However, I was raving lunatic during that time, and create some strange explanation for the voices disappearance. Some research is also showing that L-Theanine might reduce positive symptoms. Many years from that day, recently I started to take L-Theanine 600 mg with Abilify 15 mg. I take 400 mg L-Theanine at the morning with coffee, and then 200 mg at the evening. Dosage is pretty high, I know. I feel like my old self is back again. It definitely relieves tremendous social anxiety that I have. It also slightly improve focus. It affects the mood in positive way, I’m not scared of people who pass me by on the streets at my evening walk (I don’t know how paranoid the thoughts are but I usually go for a walk during evenings and fear the passerby’s). I’m more talkative again probably due to lessen of anxiety. Overall the exper
ience was great. But I’m a little bit worried that due to its effect on dopamine, long-term usage will make me psychotic again.

176150781,"It really sucks having to be a long term service user. Sometimes I feel like they ignore my needs, especially my case worker. He just talks and talks at me, and even asks questions and answers them for me before I even have a chance to speak. My psychiatrist I have known since I was 17 has now retired (I am 33 now), and the new one I have only spoken to on the phone. The psychologist retires in October, and I am guessing from what she says that my sessions will not continue with someone else. I don’t think support should be based on personnel issues. She was the one who got me diagnosed with Autism, and it was for her benefit, which now she is leaving shows there was little point in this exercise. Literally I feel completely drained by the services in my area. One thing traps me there, and it’s the fact my primary doctor will not touch my medications. I have to be part of this secondary care system to manage my meds, as every few months I need adjustments as I frequently breakdown, and need the
ir help to pick up again. I have been psychosis free for some time now, and I want a resolution to this issue. The amount of support I have received since I started actually engaging properly and taking the medication as prescribed in the last two years has shown good results psychosis wise. It all seems so tenuous though, and like a castle build on sand, and I am sick of things like anxiety, insomnia and stress dictating my life just to avoid completely breaking down and freaking out. I tried to take an overdose when I was at my old job, and I am genuinely sad that I failed to top myself. Now I live in a post-suicide attempt life full of regrets. I am not interested in living anymore. To be brutally honest, I have no idea what happened to the strength of will I had before which gave me the confidence to work straight out of hospital for example. I used to have such a good attitude when it came to working, but now I just feel completely trapped by it, and my situation requires a crash that will ruin my financ
ial position for the rest of my life if I hit that switch. It’s like the web I am stuck in is slowly strangling me, and as each day passes it feels like it’s getting tighter, and the cracks are really starting to show now. I am not sure if I can continue to mask my issues when inside I feel so broken. I still live independently, but I am not sure for how much longer I can sustain this, as I now have a precarious income that is not able to be relied on in any form. My life has no one in it that I can talk to about how I am feeling inside. Parents are pretty much the only people apart from health workers (Who ignore me) that I could have this discussion with, but they are not interested. I am lost on all of this. The changes in my employment, medication and treatment by mental health services has left me stuck in this cycle of ????, that I have no idea how to get out of it or even improve things. I feel now I want to fail. There is no other option and I need to do something drastic to sort this out as I hav
e changed into something I do not respect anymore, and I don’t think I ever could again.

I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind.

176150865,15-20 minutes. Last time was right after a drug binge. I was a little loopy but I joked so you’re not institutionalizing me he said not yet. As I was leaving. And he said I should go to a clinic. But he wasn’t against it in any way. My pdoc is really cool he’s up on the latest and greatest. He’s a hippie he went to Woodstock. A nerdy one but he prefers intellectual badass. He’s a comedian a bit. He trusts me lol he’s the chilliest pdoc ever I think and I see him every time I run out of klonipin. On my other scripts he writes 11 refills. But he has me see him when I need the kpin. For a while I wasn’t taking kpin and didn’t see him for 4 months. I saw him and it made him see my improvement on a larger scale and now he trusts me a lot. And he listens to me. At first when I saw him 20 years old he was really helpful. At 24-28 once he got me on meds he was like non attentive to me. But now I do so well he pays attention to me a lot and gives me praise not just what I felt was false hope. 
Well either way I’ve been through a lot with this pdoc. One thing I like about him is he says what you need to hear when you need to hear it. He sacrifices his pride to speak on your level. Unless you get rowdy he puts you in your place. But he’s always just exactly a half step ahead of you…where u need to be. And he has a mafia side.

176150875,"_NAME_ is a character of [English folklore]. The History of _NAME_ Thumb was published in [1621], and was the first [fairy tale] printed in English. _NAME_ is no bigger than his father’s thumb, and his adventures include being swallowed by a cow, tangling with [giants], and becoming a favourite of. The earliest allusions to _NAME_ occur in various 16th-century works such as [_NAME_ [Discovery of Witchcraft] (1584), where _NAME_ is cited as one of the supernatural folk employed by servant maids to frighten children. [Tattershall] in Lincolnshire, England, reputedly has the home and grave of _NAME_.[[1]] Aside from his own tales, _NAME_ figures in [_NAME_ play [_NAME_] , a companion piece to his [The Author’s Farce] . It was later expanded into a single piece titled [The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the History of _NAME_ Thumb the Great] . In the middle 18th century, books began to be published specifically for children (some with their authorship attributed to “_NAME_”), and by the middle 19th c
entury, _NAME_ was a fixture of the nursery library. The tale took on moral overtones and some writers, such as [_NAME_], cleansed questionable passages. [_NAME_] however refrained from scrubbing the tale of its vulgarities. _NAME_s story has been adapted into several films. "" _NAME_ the Giant Killer "" is an English [fairy tale] and [legend] about a young adult who slays a number of bad [giants] during [King _NAME_ reign. The tale is characterised by violence, gore and blood-letting. Giants are prominent in [Cornish folklore], [Breton mythology] and [Welsh Bardic lore]. Some parallels to elements and incidents in [Norse mythology] have been detected in the tale, and the trappings of _NAME_’s last adventure with the [Giant] Galigantus suggest parallels with [French] and [Breton] fairy tales such as [Bluebeard]. _NAME_’s belt is similar to the belt in “[The Valiant Little Tailor]”, and his magical sword, shoes, cap, and cloak are similar to those owned by [_NAME_] or those found in [Welsh] and [Norse] 
mythology. [_NAME_] and his tale are rarely referenced in [English literature] prior to the eighteenth century (there is an allusion to _NAME_ the Giant Killer in _PERSON_’s King Lear, where in Act 3, one character, _NAME_, in his feined madness, cries, “Fie, foh, and fum,/ I smell the blood of a British man”). _NAME_’s story did not appear in print until 1711. It is probably an _USER_ID_ publisher assembled a number of anecdotes about giants to form the 1711 tale. One scholar speculates the public had grown weary of [King _NAME_] – the greatest of all giant killers – and _NAME_ was created to fill his shoes. [_NAME_], [_NAME_], [_NAME_], [_PERSON_], and [_NAME_] were familiar with the tale. In 1962, a [feature-length film] based on the tale was released starring [_PERSON_]. The film made extensive use of [stop motion] in the manner of [_PERSON_]. A fairy ring , also known as fairy circle , elf circle , elf ring [[1]] or pixie ring , is a naturally occurring ring or arc of [mushrooms].[[2]] The ri
ngs may grow to over 10 metres (33 ft) in diameter, and they become stable over time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground. They are found mainly in [forested] areas, but also appear in [grasslands][[3]] or rangelands. Fairy rings are detectable by [sporocarps] (fungal spore pods) in rings or arcs, as well as by a necrotic zone (dead grass), or a ring of dark green grass. Fungus [mycelium] is present in the ring or arc underneath. [Fairy] rings are the subject of much [folklore] and myth worldwide—particularly in Western Europe. While they are often seen as hazardous or dangerous places, they can sometimes be linked with good fortune. = from wikipedia"

But the fact was I was struggling with depression about love failure and that was the initial stages of my illness and didnt know anything about the disease itself, but had very paranoid and delusional thoughts over my ex and thinking that people were forcing me to marry this girl. By that time, I had a bad experience with first love and never wanted it again and didn’t think about my love life, but the time has elapsed now. what I can do?"

176150938,"I have rapid cycling sza. When I have hypomania it usually only lasts a few hours, and depression can happen at same time sometimes or separate. Sometimes my depression lasts a few days and sometimes a month or two. I’ve experienced laughing and crying urges at same time. I remember one day I was walking to library with music in my ears and feeling this soaring elation. Then the same night I cut myself. Once also I had this electric hypomania for three days and the morning I suddenly crashed when I had to look for something to wear to walk to shops. I never made it there. I cut myself instead. When I relapsed in 2012 and I went to hospital in 2013, I remember before I was put on amisulpride I had severe mood swings every day, I was high then low in same day. You get the picture. When my present pdoc first diagnosed me in 2013, he said I either have rapid cycling bipolar or sza. Then last year when I returned to him he changed it to sza because of my voices, inserted thoughts, delusions and parano
ia, which sometimes happened apart from my moods."

174380702,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Paliperidone protects prefrontal cortical neurons from damages caused by MK-801 via Akt1/GSK3? signaling pathway. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ Sun, Schizophrenia research , Jun 2013 Recent studies have suggested that neurodegeneration is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and some atypical antipsychotics appear to prevent or retard progressive morphological brain changes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Whether changes in intracellular signaling pathways are related to their neuroprotective effects remains undefined. In the present study, we used mouse embryonic prefrontal cortical neurons to examine the neuroprotection of paliperidone against the neuronal damage induced by exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. Paliperidone inhibited MK-801 induced neurotoxicity both in MTT metabolism assay (p<0.01) and in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity 
assay (p<0.01). Time course studies revealed that paliperidone effectively attenuated the elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) induced by exposure to MK-801 (p<0.01). Moreover, paliperidone could significantly retard MK-801-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth (p<0.01) and reverse MK-801-induced decreases of gene expression and phosphorylation of Akt1 and GSK3? (both p<0.01). Furthermore, these protective effects of paliperidone were blocked by pretreatment with a PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Taking together, our results demonstrated that paliperidone could protect prefrontal cortical neurons from MK-801-induced damages via Akt1/GSK3? signaling pathway."

I’m pretty well adjusted to 10 mg with no symptoms but when they tried to raise it I got the side effects again so I’m back to the original 10 mg. So you might feel better after a couple weeks. If there’s anything positive it’s doing for you, that should stick around. For me it helps eliminate episodes of disassociation and reduces the frequency of negative voices. Even the akathisia comes and goes, I don’t suffer too bad with it some days. How long have you been on it exactly?"

Im still confused if i should take lexapro in morning or bedtime, I want maximum lexapro effectiveness when i am awake so taking at bedtime doesnt make sense right ? Cuz by the time i wake up, some amount of lexapro in my blood will be reduced to some extent. I just want that when i wake up my bloodstream of lexapro should start from 10mg.

176151041,I’ve heard it said that everyone has psychosis now and then. Every one hears voices every now and then. So am I really ill or am I just a fake and normal? Do I even need my meds? Maybe I’m faking it. Maybe I’m a hypocrite. Maybe I’m not really psychotic. Just because I believe there’s a man in my head that puts his thoughts in my head does that make me psychotic? Do normal people have that? How do I know I am ill or normal? So many questions… how do I make sense of it all???

I felt an unseen force/energy above my head enter into my body and caused pain in every inch of my body (head all the way down to the toes) before this occurred. I have to listen to them all the time, and they frighten me by having synchronicities in my life, dreams, and things that they have told me.

174380729,"What was it like. My last memory of being genuinely happy was like I don’t even remember. Maybe when I was 17. Then I traveled and moved away by myself, it was a disaster. Learning experience, I was always angry and bitter at a very young age, was it because of pre-schizophrenia? frustrated and lack of experience with how to deal with different people and situations, I had bursts of outrage. Then in 2011, I moved to Canada. The big change in my life triggered full-blown psychosis. I was all alone at 21 years old. I traveled back to my hometown, I still remember how traumatized I was during the flight across the ocean and my sister helped me find a psychiatrist, they put me on 5 mg Abilify. I was psychotic for like a period of 9 months. I had to find a job while I was recovering from a psychosis so I could pay for my Abilify medication which was like 200$ a month. I stayed with my sister and she took care of me. NONE of my friends helped me. I had a friend who is a drug addict, her husband was in 
prison, she visited me, she got me a stuffed animal and a balloon. I will never forget that. Fast forward a year, I moved back to Canada, I was fine for a while, it took me like 2 years to just feel like I was myself again, to find myself, I started an online business and had a relapse in winter 2013. My doctor prescribed me Zeldox and while I was coming off Abilify, winter 2014 was a nightmare. I had brain zaps, palpitations, insomnia, paranoia, delusions for 3 months until the meds kicked in. Spring 2014 was my time. I felt happy, I lost 40 lbs exercised 7 days a week, found a full time job and went to university, took art classes, marketing classes, made lots of new friends, started clubbing. It was my time. Something changed in winter 2015, I was hit by a huge flashback of the trauma of my first-time psychosis, the intrusive thoughts started. My doctor put me on Latuda and I started drinking a lot to numb down the thoughts, this combination made me talk to myself. It got really bad. I tried finding a new 
job, they fired me because I was making a lot of mistakes. Fast forward 2020. It’s been 5 years I’ve been living with intense PTSD. I did CBT, EMDR, Supplements, I tried like 20 different meds, supplements, meditation, yoga, exercise. It’s not going away. I learned to better hide it. My partner’s friends have NO CLUE I have schizophrenia. Most of my friends have NO CLUE I have schizophrenia, I am highly functional but suffering. When I’m alone I talk to myself but when I am among other people I am a great actress. I can no longer hold a full time job though, my sleep schedule is all over the place and my partner stayed with me through all of this symptoms. He’s very nice to me. If it was another guy he wouldn’t stay. I told me a few times I wanna leave and be alone but he always convinces me to stay. It’s not like some guy will be able to live with me. I asked me to buy me a VERY expensive diamond ring, he agreed. He’s a superhero. I do whatever I can to keep him happy, I have a lot to offer 
other than my awful mental health. Now mission impossible, find a solution for my PTSD, intrusive thoughts. Will I EVER find a solution? Life after schizophrenia and severe trauma I became stronger, independent, materialistic."

176151081,Omega 3 is one of the few supplements which help with cognition irrespective of whether have mental disease or not. To notice effect need to take it daily for at least 3 weeks. Also if not take it for 3 weeks straight you can notice decline in cognition also. So its not a ready to feel like supplement. I recommend now foods brand omega 3 (normal one without enteric coating). Its cheapest and also very effective. Just need to take 1 soft gel per day preferably in morning with milk or other fatty food for best absorption. Avoid taking it in evening or later part of the day as its stimulating one and can interefere with sleep.

Are you 100% sure it’s not an option to apply for alternative accommodation, even if it takes years to process & be allocated? I dunno, I’m Australian so things may be better here. It takes 10 years to get decent govt accommodation but the main thing is to get your application in with a compelling reason that the current accommodation is definitely not ok, then at least you’re on the list, in the queue. If it helps, I haven’t had a holiday in 14 years. I’m employed now so looking to have a break, even 2 nights away. I asked my entire social network to house-sit 'cos I have a pet needs tending to and of the 20 people I asked they all said no. So I can’t go on holiday. I know it’s different to your neighbours situation but still a prob with accommodation. I feel trapped. Nobody wants to house-sit cause my flat is so undesirable or whatever."

When I see a normal person, I just think “urgh, I hate this person” without knowing much about them. I still offer kindness and such, but talking to people makes me so uneasy and unsettled. I feel like there is inherent evilness inside people. I just think people are going to hate me automatically once they figure out my disability (fyi: I use crutches). Anyway, I can’t trust people anymore. They give me no reason but to hate them."

176151226,"That isn’t as straightforward as many people think. For example, saber tooth tigers had huge fangs so they could bring down large prey. When things were like this those with the largest fangs did the best, but when larger prey disappeared, those with shorter fangs did the best. So, would you say those with large fangs were the strongest? Look at elephants. People would probably say those with the most size were the strongest. But they have to eat more to maintain that large bulk. Also, if there was a particularly rainy season and the ground became mushy, the smaller elephants would do better. I could go on and on. Survival is determined by who has the best traits to meet the circumstances of the time, but those circumstances can change, and those with other traits do better."

I have a credit card which is always paid off, a bank overdraft facility and mobile phone contract… I’m managing my finances fine… Does that look like I lack capacity. They are just messing me around. They know it’ll take months to see a psychologist. Its making me really frustrated."

There are reports of people having sz-like symptoms with this condition so I don’t even know if I should open up.

We’ve had tough financial years, but not a lot of friction between us, per se. I’m not medicated into a stupor, and I can do things for myself (until we get to Wal-_NAME_ at 5 pm on Friday night…then I get frazzled and pause at every aisle and mark it as a milestone I’ve conquered) and keep up maintenance on stuff (take proper care of my computers, maintain my vehicles and make sure they’re 100% road ready, etc). I keep a filing system of documents and bills, and am the one who does the taxes. I have stuff, but if I had a day’s notice that a tornado was going to wipe away my home, I could pack my wife and our life into one car, leave, and be fine.

176151348,"_AT_MENTION_ , I sympathize with you. This is a very hard thing to live with. I had it for years and years. It’s not as simple as saying “Not everyone can like you”. It’s very draining and hard on a person when they meet with hate every where they go. When the hate is relentless, it’s very, very, very hard, if not impossible to deal with. I feel bad for you. The only thing I can suggest to you is the same thing that worked for me and that is, polypharmacy. I’m on three different AP’s for my symptoms. And they work."

176151417,"Two years ago the two board & cares I stayed in had a bedbug infestation. I shared a small room with some guy and he would make his bed and point out the bedbugs in his bedding and bites but interestingly enough, my bed was 4 feet away and I rarely found bedbugs and almost never got bitten. The owners of the group home had everybody take out all our belongings and they had an exterminator spray our rooms. It took three occasions to finally get rid of them. They moved most of us out to a facility down the street (not because of the bedbugs). But it ended up being infested too. Every night I felt them crawling over me and every morning I would wake up with 10 or 11 new bites, usually on my arms. This was every night for months. The bites leave a small red welt and one morning I got up and on a whim counted how many bites I had covering my arms and I counted about 40 new and old bites. I felt worse for the poor woman in the room next to mine than I felt for myself. She was my age but looked much older
, like a stern, prim and proper schoolteacher or something. Her room was infested as bad as mine and I remember getting up one morning and stepping out into the hallway and hearing the poor thing coming out of her room crying and pleading and begging the staff to do something about the bugs. She was pretty nice and it was wrong for the staff and owners to let us suffer for so long. I’ve moved around a lot over the years and I lived in nice places that it would it have been unthinkable to let stuff like ignoring the problem to go on. I moved out shortly after that into my current apartment. One of the counselors, helped me go through every single thing I owned and sprayed everything with straight alcohol. If I had brought bedbugs to this place I would have been promptly kicked out and I would have had nowhere to go. I would have probably had to pay the full costs of getting rid of them. And I never told a soul about this but after about a week of living here, I found two bedbugs crawling on me. I killed them 
and kept it a secret. And by some miracle I never saw another one since I’ve been here."

Also, I see little flashes, like a small flame. I’ll glance at where it came from, and nothing will be there. I’m starting to think I might be getting Parkinson’s disease. I’m at that age, and I think the med’s can do that to you. I’m going to ask a doctor about it. Maybe your med’s are having this effect on you.

174380830,"I mostly call them fake or inserted thoughts, but there can be a variety of different ones messing with me. All of them are produced by my schizophrenia. Firstly there are ideas which feel like my own, except their content is such that suggests it’s a fake idea (it’s something I wouldn’t come up with or think about, like doing something violent against my mom); haven’t felt those in a while now Then there are “simple” inserted ideas / thoughts - they are the most common. I understand them, but I also feel they are not mine There have been fake dialogues, essentially they’re like court cases - first there’s an accusation (it often also feels like an accusation), and then comes a justification which represents “me” (it sort of feels like coming from me, but still feels fake). Then after a while comes another accusation showing a flaw in the previous justification, to which “I” am supposed to respond with another justification, but all of this is actually happening automaticall
y - I have no way to think over anything or do anything in this process. This process can carry on for a while. The topics have been life events where I have done something wrong or where I could have done something better, or more mysterious concepts. It seems it’s satisfied when it has proven that I’ve done something wrong, upon which it picks another event to carry on, or it finishes. Just now while writing I got an inserted idea, carrying a feeling of “this would fit there” along with it There are fake recalls of memories - they represent a real memory, but they feel different from a real memory There are reminders, the word “reminder” describes best the feeling that accompanies them There can be fake memories - something that hasn’t actually happened, but it feels exactly like a real memory There can be a “blocked” thought or memory - in this case my schizophrenia does not allow me to recall something, and I feel that something is blocked There are inserted thoughts “with a tail” - 
those ideas/thoughts I can apparently feel a bit longer than normally. In this case “I” will supposedly “grab a thought from its “tail””, to “hold it and look at it more properly”. The quotes mean that I actually don’t do anything. This “grabbing a word from its tail” seems to be coming from a saying in my language. These are often accompanied with an image of wriggling cat tail in my mind. A “dropped” idea - it feels as if an idea/concept was dropped into my mind A “poked into” idea - feels like the idea was poked into my mind; sometimes it feels to be coming from me, but it doesn’t - that feeling is also faked Lastly, it also often shows images in my mind expressing something. It seems to be quite creative in coming up with those images, and usually it will place an “essence” in that image to further reinforce the meaning it wants the image to carry. For example, at one time it showed a picture of a group of aliens laughing at me, and it had the intense essence of “laug
hing at me mockingly”. At another time it showed the neighbor upstairs grinning at me, and the image had the essence of the neighbor “being happy about messing with me”, and the image also felt funny (I assume the “funny” was another “essence” added to the image). The topics of all these inserted things have been 1) how I’m guilty in getting my “schizophrenia”, 2) things that I’ve done wrong in my life, 3) the consequence (eternal torture after death), 4) things I’m currently doing, things I’m currently seeing or hearing around me, or feelings I am feeling, or 5) about memories of earlier events."

So a person who doesn’t smoke etc… can have these lesions, or small white dots as well. Neurologists told me mine are non specific so I was discharged from neurology. Yet I have this awful woozy head and they say, it’s not the lesions that’s causing my symptoms, so where does one go from there? I smoke, so maybe that’s why. I dont know. But my symptoms are MS type symptoms one neurologist said, but my scans dont match my symptoms. It’s all frustrating and confusing. Will see if there is any changes on my next scan. Probably wont be any change. Until something changes, neurology wont be diagnosing me with any neurological disorder. Thanks for your question."

For example, my mom believes that I don’t have MD, PTSD, or sz, and believes I’m in “medical limbo”. She often tells me that nothing is wrong with me, and it’s going to get better on its own at a snap of a finger next year. Now I’m confused. Who the actual ???? am I? What conditions do I have? Am I just lying to myself or making myself believe this? Or am I having some sort of a brain fog??? I mean, I was making art and stuff for MD awareness like hours earlier but I just get so confused. I just sometimes think this is just a horrible dream. I often get mixed up by what others say and I am just so confused.

They were both quite ill , more than you or I. But anyway, I got quite comfortable around them and familiar with them. A young man named Bill in particular, was such a sweetheart.

It didn’t change the liklihood of contracting it, but the illnesses were less likely to be severe. I don’t remember if they controlled for people having both flu and COVID at the same time, but man that would suck."

176151545,The stuff you’ve described previously seems like a metal health issue rather than an actual real world problem. Things like your neighbors knowing when you’re feeling relaxed and only then making noise to disturb you.

174380848,"First of all I want to tell you I’m sorry about your negative symptoms. They are a side effect of the AP meds and although the pdocs can’t do anything about them, we can do a lot about them. Namely, fight back against them. Force ourselves to do things no matter how hard. I know this is easier said than done but, it can be done with the right attitude. For instance, I forced myself to shower today. And in a few minutes, I’m going to force myself to do yoga."

174380866,"I forget but it was in 2013 but I was on the injection for 3 months I think…i shouldn’t have taken it the 2nd or the 3rd time I should’ve switched because it caused me muscle weakness and weird derealization too. it was a rough time in my life. im like an abilify type person, all anti-psychotics have effected me positively but some less side-effects. hence abilify which tends to favor a low side-effect profile. prolixin I had trouble sitting still in the movie theaters and I got in a car accident when I didn’t take the Cogentin one time. they seemed to think the Cogentin was necessary and gave it to me at the beginning in the hospital…or maybe I complained of shaking. I couldn’t really tell you. They only gave it to me the last night I was leaving in the hospita by liquidl. and then they gave me an injection an hour before I left. they were abusive in a lot of ways. and they didn’t even test the med they just wanted to give me the cheapest injection they could. and I was optimistic to 
try it out because they said it could work but 3 months later I was happy to get off it. I hope it works for you though. I think _AT_MENTION_ takes it?"

176151561,I once wanted to play the trumpet but failed to speak up to my Dad about a band camp I had to attend one day he was keeping me and my brothers in the Summer. So we went fishing and I had a ton of study hall instead. It was simply how I was then with a failure to communicate due to an anxiety that has plagued me most of my life.
176151562,"I’ve been on lamitrogine for 12 years. It’s been good in controlling the mood swings, in fact, that was a big problem for me prior to using it.

And then I have strange hallucinations that she says most people who suffer with schizophrenia don’t have. She’s having me see other doctors: neurologist, have a head scan done and other stuff. The medicine I am on doesn’t work that well. When I was on risperidone, and the voices either went away or got really low. But I was super tired all the time, and I felt like my muscles hurt. I’ve been on 3 different meds since that one and none of them don’t really do much."

176151587,My perspective is a little different. The divorce was one of the best things to happen to me. It was difficult going from a wife and two kids to nothing. I was so occupied and busy when married. It was like going 100 mph to 10 mph. I’ve adjusted to a more quiet life. I actually prefer being single to married. I have no desire to be married again. The only hard part is not seeing my kids as much as they and I would like. At the end of the day divorce is a personal decision.

Smoking also made bad combination with wellbutrin. The only reason I would recommend is if you sleep 16-18 hours a day, binge eating everything you eat. The problem with wellbutrin is that it increases dopamine and nanodrenaline, our antipsychotics block dopamine receptors so we end up with almost no dopamine and a lot of adrenaline aka anxiety instead which sucks really"

I created this simulation so I wouldn’t feel alone. Option 3: Everyone else is God. They are a hive mind and they have me trapped in their universe/simulation. Personally I believe in option 1 and 2 the most. I don’t dwell on this ‘delusion’. I live a normal life.
176151664,I sympathise for u … My head hurts from too much sleep

174380882,"According to the concepts of classical knowledge about the essential nature of Sz; A genetic disorder or anatomical change in the brain causes the symptoms of a medical condition called SZ schizophrenia . This is unreal According to the realistic phenomena,processes and inner events, the SZ causes (fabricates) a chemical change in the brain by action of external factor called Hallucination So that: the person’s will and immune system can mute (inhibit ) the personal thoughts sequence ,but cannot inhibit the audible vocal thoughts because they are issued from stranger body (hallucination) who is not a part from the genetic material In general,IF THERE IS a chemical disorder ,it is not Self-Origin at all ,this is the principle core for the difference between what is real and unreal !! For may reasons,do not keep in mind the mythological believe that the hallucination is a human genetic expressions or a productions of mental functions"
176151672,"Sweden is the strictest in Europe on weed. As a weed addict myself I dont recommend it. You still want to smoke, you just engage in riskier behaviors and end up hanging with unsavory people. Thats how I got into meth. Again, doesnt change anything, just makes it worse"

176151676,Some people can react negatively to it and do weird things I’ve heard. I’d say that would only be a tiny percentage of those who take it. Sleepers aren’t bad in my book as sleep is so needed. Hope it goes well for you. If you do strange things like sleep walk I’d stop it!

174380891,"I was supposed to talk to my therapist but missed the call. I’m kinda glad cause I really didn’t feel like talking yet. I just woke up. Talked to my doc he wants to upgrade me to the invega trinza shot. One injection every three months. I feel like he wanted me to be excited. I just said, “oh alright.” Not like the injection gets rid of schizophrenia so I’m not really that excited."
176151680,I already have I think she is being quite unprofessional she just started me on antidepressants a few weeks ago and then after a week of been on them she said she couldn’t see me for 3 weeks because she was fully booked so I have had to suffer on medication that was making me really unwell that I couldn’t even get out my bed and when I phoned and asked what to do she told me to just stay on it so I just came off it myself.
176151681,Hi _AT_MENTION_ I’ve had thought broadcasting a number of times. I found it extremely distressing. Feeling naked and wanting to censor my own thoughts. The medication will stop it. It won’t last. It’s not real - it’s a symptom. Hope you get relief soon. xx
176151682,Yes my delusions led me into suicide. I nearly killed myself twice. I thought I was Jesus and needed to die to prove that to myself and everyone. Antipsychotics stopped that for me but I still get suicidal ideas like going to heaven faster with suicide. But I don’t act on them while on working meds.

176151687,"sorry to hear you are scared. I can only say like the others, take your meds and keep taking them. Also if you have to go to the psych ward for a while it’s usually ok… you don’t want to be there but it’s prob less scary than you think now."
176151688,This used to happen to me. I’d stay up until 5 or 6 am and then sleep through the afternoon. Wake up a 3 or 4 in the afternoon. it doesn’t happen anymore though. It stopped.

174380886,"You can get these kind of abilify side effects when you take TMG, so take that too with supervision. DMG gives lighter effects. If take two TMG capsules at once they can get hypersexual, aggressive etc (me got like this without any positive symptom history). Hard to sleep at night etc. I think its the side effect of all things which improves negative symptoms. Need to have control. NAC with cofactors is like a control giving supplement so its better to take it if you find yourself out of control either on abilify or TMG."

I also thought I was poisoned at times. This all happened in hospital. And also that I was possessed by the devil who was making me see things in a warped way. And this is only from my 1st psychotic episode. I had loads more during my 2nd as well.

176151699,"It is a noble act to try and help out even though the guy cannot help himself or be helped. You are not a professional to step in and don’t have the support system behind you to ensure proper health and services are provided for him. You did the best you could, but he is bound to be defensive in such a paranoid state. Taking into account the alcohol misuse you are probably on a hiding to nothing. He doesn’t want to be helped, so it is difficult to help him. Most people will say to call an ambulance, but I expect he will be paralytic somewhere public and an ambulance will be called anyway upon which he will most likely be sectioned. He will hate you for your help, but what can you do really?"

176151714,"My sister used to be that way. Never understood because she was always happy. Until one day she wasn’t. ? Maybe your friend will understand some day. Maybe she has been depressed but was able to pull herself through and now she only remembers bits and pieces and that she was able to pull herself through so she thinks everyone should be able to.

176151728,"It might be possible to get off meds if it was just a single episode, but coming off meds must be done under strict 24/7 supervision. You WILL strongly resist going back on meds if you relapse, and the desire to commit suicide may become overwhelming. Going off meds is really serious business and the risk of suicide, brain damage, permanent physical injury, judicial prosecution or imprisonment is very significant.

176151768,"I agree to an extent. Psychosis increases your brain’s analytical capacity and allows you to connect concepts that you might not otherwise realise are related. Just like the mind of a genius. Part of the reason for this is that during psychosis your brain’s filters are stripped away so you become aware of much more stimuli. However - as a result of this, most (if not all) people who are having a psychosis, experience apophony (a dellusional epiphany) - where they believe that two concepts are connected or related that almost any other person who is not experiencing mental illness would not be able to see, and that can be invalidated through scientific inquiry. Ie; many of the beliefs that are formed are false / dellusional / not real."

I’m torn with all meds between living better now and possible issues later in life.

Right now I’m in a relativity good place but see myself declining again that’s why I wanted to reach out. I don’t want to lose the good things in my life again because I’m unable to handle the pain of a downward slide. When it comes to the pain of others I feel it’s not that I can take away their pain but instead simply 
that I’m able to sympathize and thus able to be a better person to all. I feel all the pain screaming and crying, loss and violation, cuts and gunshots, beatings and love lost. Honestly it’s totally overwhelming but when it stops im able to deal with the pain I suffer with a sort of numbness because it doesn’t compare even remotely to that which I have felt from others and I find myself playing devil’s advocate for even the worst scenarios. I do feel as if I am “the one” or “the chosen” for a while I felt I was even possibly the second coming of jesus however I guess my delusions have settled on me simply being an offspring of _NAME_ with his wisdom meant to help heal the world and bring us all to a new world of peace and enlightenment. I know it’s insane to say out loud (luckily I’m only typing it lol) but I’ve even been convinced that if I focused hard enough long enough I would even be able to learn to fly. I did try an anti-pshyc once for a while I tested it for a dealer friend of mi
ne years ago it was seroquel and on an extremely high dose even my friends made comments about how different and even how “normal” I seemed. Maybe that is what I need to look into in order to try and subvert another major fall. I really appreciate your input and the others that have spoken up. I’m really trying to learn all I can in order to best handle what I’m facing."
176151796,"I can really relate to all you saying here. I’m 46 and have wasted most of my life and am still trying to recover, but the delusions I have are very strong, the isolation all that stuff you said. I guess I always wanted to break free form it, but couldn’t. It’s like I don’t even know who I could have been if all this didn’t happen to me. It’s a lot like I’ve been in the vietnam war for a super long time and have PTSD somewhat."
176151797,One of the reasons I was the most popular person in my elementary school was because I was the best athlete in the school. Also they had a list of everybody’s times with the 100 dash and other things in the hallway. I had the best times.

176151802,"Nutritional yeast is basically flakes of dead yeast. It tastes sort of like cheese. I have a recipe for vegan ricotta cheese. It’s basically sunflower seeds, tofu, lemon juice, _NAME_ oil, and nutritional yeast. I can share it if you want. You need a food processor though, and it’s pretty expensive to make. Almond milk is pretty good, and there are loads of almond or coconut milk ice creams and yogurts. It’s important to note that none of these actually taste like real cheese/milk/ice cream. It takes a few months to acquire the taste. If you’re more worried about nutrition and less worried about eating products that taste vaguely like dairy, fortified almond milk usually has loads of calcium and vitamin D added in."
176151803,The only thing that helped me was medicine. I couldn’t get out of any of the delusions myself…
176151804,"Hi _AT_MENTION_. Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant.

At other times it’s pretty cool especially when we have activities that are fun and it’s nice to have transportation provided. However I miss being able to cook for myself even though I didn’t always do a good job doing it, and privacy as the walls seem thin. I have discovered that the only way you can have a girlfriend is for a woman to provide the transportation, and practically everything else as there was a guy who had one.

176151823,"Hello hello. I’m going to change my eating habits slowly so I don’t lose motivation too quickly. Today is the start of week 3 of my weight-loss program and I’m down 3 lbs from 236 to 233. I still like to sneak in chocolate and high-sugar fruits though but I’m slowly working on that. Also I woke up ravenous in the middle of last night and had 300 calories worth of snacks like a banana, 10 potato chips and two pieces of chocolate. I went over my calorie budget for that day Today I had a highish? protein breakfast, the food I ate wasn’t super ideal though but I don’t feel hungry so it was still an okay choice. The first bit of weight comes off kinda easily but really want to lose at least 30 lbs. So yeah, gotta keep at it for a while."
176151824,Welcome to the forum! I still smoke so I can’t answer your question. Hopefully you will get some answers soon. Just wanted to welcome you to the forum and give you a “bump” up the board.

176151839,I appreciate everyone here… I am happy I found this forum
176151840,No but I was at a resturant with my parents (post covid) and I heard a song that was about the thought I was thinking.
174380922,"I would love to answer any questions you have and if you would like me to go more in depth with anything I can. • I define love as supporting and being there for someone no matter what, through all the bad times and good times. If you can’t support someone and hold them when things are bad it isn’t love. • Fear is feeling like your heart has stopped and u can’t move, breathe or think as if you are crumbling into a millions of pieces (that’s kind of how I feel when I feel fear) • so far medication hasn’t helped my schizophrenia but I have only really started my treatment. The most helpful thing for me so far has been talking to people here who understand what I’m going through it makes me feel less alone. • When things get extreme the voices control everything I do from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. They are horrible to me, the torture me every day. When I do things that they don’t want me to do I hallucinate me, my mum and my boyfriend being murdered. They 
tell me to self harm and kill myself and when I do self harm they praise me and lay off a bit until they feel like torturing me again. • I live with my mum and I completely rely on other to be able to live. I can’t be alone at all anymore incase I hurt myself. I also can’t go anywhere at all really like walk my dog, go to school, go the the shop ect so it truly is a disabling illness. I’m pretty much stuck to my bed most of the time like I can’t really cook anymore because the voices dont want me to and I start hallucinating badly when I try to do anything."
176151841,I find it the other way around.
176151842,The internet shows who people really are. Make what you want of that.
174380931,"That’s interesting. I’m having a hard to following because my brain is mush these days, but hopefully they’ll do more research and figure out how to best help these subgroups. Hard to say which I fall into since onset of psychosis and sz diagnosis were about 10 years apart. But I have more in common with the late onset TRS subtype. When I was first hospitalized for psychosis (was originally diagnosed PD) they put me on Abilify and it worked well for many years until I went off it. Then I went through a dozen other meds before giving up and just being unmedicated for a bit until I was hospitalized again and they put me on Haldol. Tried adding others in addition because the haldol wasn’t working well enough. Finally tried upping the dose, but even that wasn’t enough and I ended up hospitalized again because it had pretty much stopped working altogether. Been on my current med for about a year and it’s like a bomb I’m just waiting to go off and stop working like the rest of them."
176151843,I don’t recall any names. I had too many voices to count and I was so distressed by them that I was overwhelmed by it all which made me snap in the end. All my relapses have luckily not gone far enough for them to take over again like they did the first and second times.

176151845,"My old pdoc assured me it was very rare for TD to occur. Like 1 in 1500 patients on AP’s is what he told me. I had this side effect you speak of, and I was given Diazepam and Procycldine and it went away. Also had cogwheel rigidity"

I’ll explain it to you most characteristics of humans are due to genetic adpation, as to what gives successful reproduction from one generation to the next.

Thats what gives most successful reproduction. No matter how unbelievably ???????? it is thats why it persists. There is no such thing as friends."
176151847,I took them for adhd. I got addicted and started to snort them at parties and my first psychotic episode was after taking way to much at a wild halloween party in a downtown collective.

176151853,"Yeah I feel generally lucky with my sz and recovery. I know there are a lot of people with sz that’re doing good, but I know that a lot of people haven’t gotten off so well.

176151890,I think it’s just situational but I have a month to find a new job and it’s the weekend and theres really nothing I can do to work towards finding a new job right now. I already emailed 5 places my cover letter and resume and now I just have to wait. Yet this constant feeling of anxiety is really exhausting me. What if I can’t find a job in a month and then I’m out of work? I don’t have much savings I can’t afford to not work for very long. I could make it maybe a month and a half tops without working. I just have so many bills. Constant constant anxiety is welling up and I don’t know what to do to remain calm. I don’t want to take an ativan cause I save those for panic attacks but my normal calming techniques aren’t working. Anyone have any tips on how to not be a little ball of anxiety over this weekend?

You sound to be pretty aware of your stuff these days. I didn’t get diagnosed till 29. I’m now 49. It was a hell of a long journey to get to here for me but I’m not in too bad a place… How you doing now _AT_MENTION_ ? Sometimes those answers can be ever so elusive…"

176151896,"_AT_MENTION_, in _NAME_ can you go to the grocery store and pharmacy?"
174380939,"Thank you for sharing your experience, percpetions and some of the ideas that you have generated in order to have some sort of context. In my experience with perceptions I have found that it is best to take everything with a ‘grain of salt’. It is quite apparent to me after many years of dealing with the phenomena even beyond ‘audio’ and into all other senses, is that it is best not to make attributions or develop ideas or concepts to explain or interpret what is perceived; but, instead to withhold judgement (or coming to a conclusion) about what is happening. Far to often, those in our community fall for in the ‘deciphering or decrypting trap’. Based upon the data and information we have acquired throughout our incarnated memories, collective consciousness, or this life experience or our senses – in bits and pieces – we tend to jump to conclusions. This has the potential to lead us down paths and into areas where in which we are further isolated and messed with. I suggest that you 
do not attribute the things you perceive or experience to any particular source, but instead, continue testing these perceptions and experiences. I am not suggesting to become a closed minded skeptic, or go into denial, but instead remain open and simply acknowledge, without embracing or averting, what ever you may perceive or experience. Instead be open to revealed evidence that is held in our communities. I have to retain a sense of discernment in regard to how I respond in this realm. For instance, most people would jump out of the way of a bus that was speeding towards them, so in turn I should. Likewise, I don’t jump off a building because I “know” I can fly, instead because I wish to retain a conscious affect and effect in this world, I agree with the commonly held consensus that gravity is an immutable Law of Nature and those without wings can not fly. Of course I am not going to tell you there are no aliens, that they have never visited us, or that they have, in some way, effected or affected us
. At the same time, I am not going to embrace that explanation and develop a whole lifestyle, cosmology, theology and world view along that thinking either; because I simply do not know enough and additionally, my attempt is to participate in the world where the consensus among most people is that, all of that, is not “real”. Essentially, though I have perceptions, experience and even evidence that defies the hegemonic view point most people have accepted and operate from, it would be silly to be so divergent so as to eliminate any sort of good effect I could have on others, by becoming so strident that I alienate others and loose life purpose with them. It is apparent to me that, I have a life that is kind of balancing act, like walking a thin line that is crooked and wound in such a way, wherein I can experience intense awe or horror if wander off to far and forget why I came here in the first place. This is what it is all about really, walking the line. I privately find a balance in a rational and reas
onable consensus within our communities consensus, especially among those that are not holey sold over to the idea that our experiences and perceptions are only the result of biological or genetic disease AND not embracing the idea that totally numbing myself with chemicals, in the long or short term, is good for me. There is a point and purpose, you can find it, among those who are not so sure, you are not one of us."

176151904,yes ofcourse. tgysw4ergsder
176151905,"I used to listen to a lot of depressive black metal, grindcore, stay alone a lot, self harm. So no i was really not taking care of myself."
176151906,Drinking water and going for a walk will help. Anything to use energy.
176151907,I will report to you if I ever get a chance to do so.
176151908,Prozac did nothing for me! I didn’t even notice it but I don’t have ocd!
176151909,"Usually if I get flagged, it means I’m close to the truth…well, most of the time."
176151910,I’m sure you are not sexist
176151911,I don’t know about you but I have suicidel thoughts and the pdoc put me on lithium Wich help me quite a bit.
176151912,I have memory problems and intrusive thoughts. Anyone else? How long till im better? Shot 1 month ago
176151913,Yeah bad move. Not the best for most sz people and it’ll be a step backwards. You under more stress or something lately? R you doing ok?
174380940,But they are coming from you those voices so it’s part of your brain even if it feels otherwise. Maybe your subconscious
176151914,I made this today
176151915,Congratulations! You’re a sweetheart. You deserve a happy life.
176151916,It looks really tasty…
176151917,"Can I get over my sz even if I remain on klonopin? Or this benzo can become an obstacle even for my recovery? This is my main question… Please, share your thoughts… I know one lady, who is prescribed xanax till life… but wont we be zombies with a benzo till life? Are there people who are happy and healthy even while being on a benzo all their lives? I wonder also if I’ll start to need it less and less if I start to recover… but my fear is that its strongly addictive, I am not sure this can happen… Anyone else in the world who was on a benzo all his life, but he was fine despite this? Sorry if my questions are boring… I just dont know how dangerous is this med… I fear that a lit tbh, will I be unhealthy on it? But yeah, for me, this friend of mine, who is prescribed a xanax till life is a phenomenon to me… she even believes, that the xanax is not addictive lol… She just said, that the thing is to not raise the dosage lol…"
176151918,"No side effects, high cholesterol and high blood pressure meds don’t really have side effects. I take these along with diabetes meds Metformin, I have no side effects. Psychiatric meds have side effects though. Its up to your Dr to prescribe them, my cholesterol and triglycerides were well over the limit and now they’re normal. Diet alone doesn’t help much, you need exercise. Mine were high even when I was able to eat healthy and exercise."
176151919,A few weeks. _PERSON_ better once back to reality.
176151920,Our population is mostly around the coast. There’s little arable land in the interior of Australia. It’s mostly desert. I was amazed when I lived over there of how many little towns and out of the way places there were. We can drive here for hours and not see a town. In America you’d pass or drive through so many little settlements. It’s only triggering if you let it. Sounds like an adventure. I’d suggest you go with others because there could be dangers with decaying architecture but I’d say that would be an interesting outing!
176151921,"I Am Impressed!. Kinda Reminds Me of Something _NAME_ Would Record. Only Not as Bulky. Although I Am Fascinated (by) His Pure Talent. I Once Had a Soundcloud Account Years Ago. I Would Try And Share Some Of What I Was Able to Record Last Year, But Thus Website Doesn’t Allow That Kind of Format or Whatever. I’d love To Begin to Record Some New Material And Share it On Thus Website. But Soundcloud isn’t What I’m Looking For. N e Hoo. Good Job (!!!)… . …"
176151922,At night when you’re asleep?
176151923,How do they disturb you?
176151924,"I allow myself a certain amount of calories a day. I’m not starving myself. It’s the quality of foods I consume not necessarily the amount. But if you suffer with a eating disorder I can see how counting your calories can become a problem. I don’t suffer from an eating disorder. It’s kind of like a hobby, it gives me something to do. Counting calories is not necessary to losing weight."
176151925,"yes! Depending on how I feel, I’ll wait till later in the night to take my latuda. Otherwise, when I take it with dinner, I’m asleep by 8 or 9 pm. It’s almost like a sleeping pill for me"
176151926,Just browsing after breakfast. I too love the early mornings. I usually get up around 5:30am and it’s all so quiet and peaceful. Great time of the day before everything ramps up with the sun. Glad your enjoyed your morning.
176151927,"Don’t worry about your dad, it was probably just a random weird voice thing. How ya doin’ _AT_MENTION_ . Hope you, your GF and your frogs are doing well."
176151928,Fun sounds nice. I have no idea other than hanging out with the kids
176151929,"i mentioned it to a psychiatrist, she wasnt surprised or anything and just treated everything in a professional manner."
176151930,"I have to move these plans to the next day, decided to stay in today. Asking for my friend to pick me up a venti iced peppermint mocha frappacino."
176151931,"I am not learning ANYTHING about statistics. The only thing I am learning is how to pull information from the world’s most boring powerpoints and use it to answer questions. I am not retaining a single thing I’ve “learned” from the whole class. I mean, it’s easy enough to get a good grade, but I was hoping to actually develop a proficiency in the subject, not just get a good grade. Does anyone else have online class woes? Programming is better, because the teacher actually makes entertaining youtube videos with jokes and stuff so my eyes aren’t just glazed over."
174380950,You just need to try a new med then. You could be treatment resistant as well.
176151932,"Not sure about semen production, but my sperm count ain’t what it used to be. I blame the vasectomy."
176151933,"I hope they will help you. Hope you can stand up for yourself, they cant just let you struggle when you get psychotic! My response to sertraline wasnt good either btw…I didnt get psychotic, but i felt really weird. Perhaps just lowering the dose would help?"
176151934,A year at McDonald’s
176151935,Hey mate and my other Californian peeps. This sounds serious so keep indoors and look after yourselves. It seems a fast moving situation but your health and welfare and that of your family and friends are paramount. Hang in there matey and sounds like self isolation is required.
176151936,"I’m happy for you, I know you’ve been waiting for this for a long time"
176151937,I’ve mostly pushed them away cos Idk how to be friends atm. There’s one guy I text regularly. We both have an eating disorder. So that’s one thing we have in common.
176151938,I know my symptoms and illness though
176151939,Well I don’t believe in hell. I believe that everyone is going to heaven where everyone is equal and healthy forever. Yes I am optimistic.
176151940,Congratulations!!! All your hard work paid off! And after a TBI and everything!!! Good job!!!

176151942,I’m sorry 15 characters.
176151943,I love it! Very nice
176151944,Maybe you need another medication. It’s posible that the meds you’re taking are not working.
174380954,"Well it’s just in rodents so far. But the bit about the microglia intrigued me. They are also trying it prenatally to prevent schizophrenia. Intriguingly, the beneficial effects of lifelong choline supplementation reduce the activation of microglia. Microglia are specialized cells that rid the brain of deleterious debris. Although they naturally occur to keep the brain healthy, if they are overactivated, brain inflammation and neuronal death … will occur. The observed reductions in disease-associated microglia, which are present in various neurodegenerative diseases, offer exciting new avenues of research and suggest ways of treating a broad range of disorders, including traumatic brain injuries, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease."
176151945,It did when it happened I think. I was at work and my manager saved me
174380949,"I always have this energy rush before taking my meds. I am sure this is bad energy from the unhealthy dopamine rush in my brain which causes positive symptoms. I wish I could make use of that energy without having positive symptoms. I once stopped meds for a year before ending in mental hospital, I had more energy but couldn’t use it or function due to positive symptoms. I was even less social without meds."
176151946,I wonder. I think the pain is equal - of going hungry and of being overfilled. I just wanted to be knocked out until it passed.
176151947,NAC didn’t do anything for my negatives
176151948,I’ve read you can keep your medicare after coming out of disability for 9 years or something close to that.
176151949,"no nobody’s useless !! do you live with someone? you aren’t homeless are you? learn to love yourself , dude…only you can do that.;"
176151950,I eat a lot of nuts which are high in magnesium. But I’m happy most of the time just obsessed with my experience because it was so real
176151951,"Nobody on tv is that real. If they’re not literally acting, they’re all dolled up to impress you. Don’t be impressed. They tend to be very insecure people, too."
176151952,Once. I was manic and prone to violence.
176151953,"There’s a chance that there is a difference in subjects in sz, but I always thought it was the same. See I just think the symptoms are not noticed by the patient and that is it."
176151954,"Do you find it hard to shower, cook and clean?"
174380960,Go off clozapine because of low white blood cell level? What were your symptoms? What did you replace it with?
176151955,Did this happen to anyone cuz it did to me? I’ve read of some here did u recover… is it only erection quality? I really hope so
176151956,Am not brave enough to that
176151957,Hope you feel better after 48 hours. Eat something good and do whatever you enjoy.
176151958,"Every so often I get a flashback about how tired I was when I ate to much. Not to mention stretching my stomach and chest muscles to accommodate. That was painful. So, you who have an obesity problem I’d say become sensitive to yourselves. Don’t go numb. Because you’ll wake up to the pain later."
176151959,I’d say 325 degrees for less or equal to an hour should do it. Maybe even less because its pork.
176151960,Feeling pretty stable lately _AT_MENTION_ Thanks
176151961,"I can see that. There is a difference between being let down by discovering your crush is a real person with faults, and not putting them on a pedestal in the first place, then noticing they aren’t perfect. I was going to write a line about it not being all about body parts, but realised when I was last attracted to a woman, that was still my main focus. Does that make me a bad person?"
176151962,Sounds good
176151963,"I understand having reservations, I’d love to get back into my nursing, but I’m scared as well. You would be taken care of if you were caretaker of your sister? That does sound nice. I’ve been paid as a caretaker before too. That changes my vote"
176151964,"i dont want to even look like those in olympia there to big, i want to be natural, it looks more appealing to eyes."
174380955,Change it to “evilpixel” (or is that too edgy? I had to think of something)
176151965,"After taking Amyloban 3399 for about 3 weeks I developed a mild dizziness from it. This dizziness became severe over last 3 days. I was about to stop taking it then suddenly it seemed this dizziness mitigated last night, however I had very light sleep last night which was unusual. I decided to keep taking Amyloban today and see how it goes."
176151966,Where Is _AT_MENTION_
176151967,Yes you are right. They are both rich. I guess wealth and political power goes hand in hand in many countries.
176151968,I gradually got worse mood wise. It was a slow change. My pdoc took me off it. Believe it or not cymbalta cut my appetite so I lost a lot of weight. But that’s not why I was taking it.
176151970,Yeah I guess I’ll never know for sure because it’s based on opinion.
176151971,"It’s been my experience that AA meetings can vary from group to group. I suppose they all have a certain feel, but they also can vary widely in quality. They say there are no bad AA meetings, but I have been in a bad meeting, where I was thinking, “Is this an AA meeting, or is this the twilight zone?” If a town has one AA group it probably has another. If one group doesn’t suit you, look for another. Personalities can clash. Don’t take it personally. Don’t think it is anybody’s fault. That is just life. Some AA meetings might be made up of a group of older men having a quiet discussion in a back room at a church. Another one might be full of young people. In the big cities there are very large AA groups of more than a hundred participants. Some AA meetings have a number of pretty young women, which is probably a distraction from the pursuit of sobriety. They also have NA meetings for people addicted to drugs. Both AA and NA are twelve step groups, and one can do for another in a pinch
. Remember, if one AA meeting is rubbing you the wrong way, there most likely other AA meetings in your town."
176151972,_AT_MENTION_ do you find them out of proportion? I don’t think I draw realistically.
176151973,You can do it:^) I have faith in ya:^)
176151974,"Try to keep faith… It will be ok after we die, I am sure of it . Its just an earth life illness… It wasn’t our fault either… Take it as any other illness. You are a good person no matter what and I think up there we all will have peace."
176151975,my threads seem cool
176151976,"I was led from London to Paris on the Eurostar to join a terrorist group, as I thought I was being controlled by Al Qaeda and the people I was hallucinating were using magic to control electronics. They kept on coming up to me and these hallucinations felt very real and they were converting me into a terrorist I got to Paris, and I was riding the subway, and when I got off at a station, I realised I had a back pack with a bomb in it. Safe to say I panicked. I went through a tunnel in their subway network, and saw the army patrolling and freaked out After that I checked into a hotel, and called my mother back in England with my phone that only had 3% battery left. The hotel was called the Ibis, but I thought that was Western code for the Abyss. I tried to break the cable on the window to jump out, as I think I must have been on the 10th floor. My mother came to France and brought me home. I was very sick but still remember bits of information like the above. Another time before I had entire situatio
ns and scenarios building that included other people. The worst ones were at my University Campus, where people were constantly threatening to kill me, and I was always being followed. Scary times. I do not want this again"
176151977,"People are embarrassed and frightened of MI. They think - if it can happen for him, it can happen for me… Glad youre out of hell, i was the same place a month ago, but out now."
176151978,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !
176151979,I miss my granny’s apple pies. My mother is luckily still alive. She’s 61 and going strong.
176151980,I unreservedly accept that you didn’t report me. The anonymity of the process may have contributed to trigger this particular bout of paranoia. My humblest apologies.
176151981,There is one but they don’t accept anyone. I’m not sure what the criteria is. I’ve left messages. There is nothing else even remotely close. Many many hours away and likely wouldn’t accept someone from another province. I’m kind of not in a great position
176151982,When I write in my journal rhyming words that don’t make sense eg. Teeny weeny teeny tiny feeny finy tiny tinny tin can can can can you do the can can… Wasting paper pyper pire pyper piya pyrate pyre pyrate gyrate… F**k stuck no luck step in front of a truck duck down eiderdown pillow sleep… Time tyme dyne kyne syme yyme wyme… And so on And yet this happens only when I write and it pours out. But not when I talk. When my thoughts jumbled like this I don’t talk I just write Usually happens when I’m hypomanic or agitated
176151983,Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_
176151984,I have had delusions like that too. Or similar. I thought the father of my unborn son was my romantic soulmate . I have a boyfriend now. I want to feel soulmate intimacy. I have only experienced such intimacy with the father of my unborn son. I cried on his face when we made love. See if my boyfriend and I will come together in sacred union.
175136369,"I just got a test today for covid19 over a sore throat. I think its unnecessary but I took some allergy medicine and I feel better. I’ll find out the results in 48 hours. I think I need to be more careful about where I go and the people I come close to/who aren’t wearing masks or aren’t also being mindful. A lot of people aren’t wearing them anymore, not sure if they were effective enough or some people consider themselves above it all/and some think the virus never existed. Some people say its like a flu and some say its worse. I was advised to get a flu shot after I asked. They say it prevents 70 percent of flu strains so must be a strong vaccine. And then people keep dissing that I am on medicaid even though I love it–because I dont pay copays etc. and Im tired of being denied things just because people want to diss medicaid. Im supposed to be fully covered in my state for things that are essential."
176151985,"Its better to not think about it. I wanted to kill when off meds and saw ppl like chickens. I saw dead bodies in the bathtub and blood on walls, I thought they were signs from the Italian mafia to kill me when I was in Italy. I thought the hotel I was in was run by that mafia so I thought about harming them but I didn’t."
176151986,Same here I think it might be partly cos they don’t want us to get put off these meds. Cos we might kill someone or ourselves. Etc etc etc
176151987,I had a psychiatrist many years ago who said to me: “you are sooo hot”.
176151988,I started dealing with it at 30 as well. I feel shafted because I should have been in the clear due to my age.
174380956,Partial agonists can be antoagonists or agonists depending on dopamine concentration. I was right. Dopamine (neurotransmitter) is a full agonist of the dopamine receptor.
176151989,Hmm maybe ssdi doesnt count towards your income for Medicaid? I was reading differently online but maybe it was wrong

176151995,You’re not on TV. I wish you could see that.
176151996,If you have to fake anything to claim disability then that’s fraud. It’s because of people behaving like this that they make it so hard to get for everyone else
176151997,"I’m sorry you’re going through this…Do you have any activities that you can do that help you not focus on the voices, like housework, simple tasks like organizing things, cleaning things, etc.? Or maybe something creative like a coloring book or playing an instrument? It always helps me to get involved in a task of some kind when my visuals are bad. Good luck to you. I know how scary hallucinations can be. They can really turn your world upside down. I hope that you can find good things around you to focus on that help to keep your mind relaxed."
176151998,I think I spend too much time in introspection. For me it isn’t healthy or productive. I have got to stop living in my head and just start living
176151999,"Well I’m leaving for now, but I hope you feel better. I really will be thinking of you and hoping things get better. I’m glad you are seeking help. You seem like a warm, intelligent and capable young lady. It was nice meeting you."
176152000,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 15
176152001,"Also, I will have some unpleasant thoughts about my relatives, sometimes . For example, I would think whast if my son had a traffic accident? or when I was in a high building I would think what if I fell down from the high building. I am sure the those people who are healthy will have this type of thoughts."
176152002,"I have asked my GP and Psychiatrist and both told me they don’t know much about CBD so I’ve been forced to do my own research, they basically told me the jury is still out. I understand the “Ask your doctor” advice and for the most part I agree with it but on more than one occasion I’ve gotten conflicting advice from different doctors on the same topic. I agree with you that you shouldn’t trust everything you read on the Internet but there is more than 1 article discussing what I was talking about."
176152003,It’s a lot but used to drink a whole bottle of wine once in a great while used to drink _NAME_ too. Then my voices came along from smoking weed and I dont touch the stuff just smoke ciggorets
176152004,to 250mg only but its better than nothing
176152005,"for all those mentioning akathisia have you tried benztropine? it seems to work a bit for me for that side effect,"

176152008,if i took it what would it do?
176152009,Gosh I’m sorry to hear that. Is there any symptom in particular you’ve been struggling with lately? I’m happy to share what got me through my med free years. Of course what helped me may not help you but who knows maybe it could. I know how tough this is. Hang in there!!
176152010,does the lexapro help intrusive thoughts at all?
174380963,"The same way, really."
176152011,its not a belief its the truth and ive tried to trust their advice
176152012,"the best version for me is to slowly do things, there are ups and downs. When you get up, get as much done…when you have down. Just feel down…we prolly dont have same sympthoms…but trying different things can help i think. i Somewhat have a therapist now, she agrees with some things i do. I dunno if i should continue though…it was sorta a last min thing. I think best thing is to not snap at all costs"
176152013,And a beaten doll there is no fixing.
176152014,It’s still happening. Let me download firefox to see if it happens on that.
176152015,"I can’t imagine anyone can force ECT on you. That’s not even a healthy procedure to a lot of people, I would never agree to it. What happened to me was I was forced on an injected medicine I hadn’t been on before, and had bad side effects from it that lasted a few months. But that’s the worst that can happen. I was told later by another mental health professional that if I insist on a pill medication that a needle won’t be forced on me again. I can’t imagine ECT being forced on anyone, unless it’s the 1950’s. I don’t think you need to worry about that."
176152016,We don’t hate you. I don’t know how you came to that conclusion.
176152017,Nothing really happens if i miss one or two doses. I’ve never really gone much longer than that so i can not prognosticate what would happen if I did. I’m sure it wouldn’t be good.
176152018,"It seems like online dating hasn’t worked for many people on the forum, Or for you in the past. Maybe you should tell your friends and clubhouse members that you’re looking and see if they know someone that might be good for you.

176152020,I’m paranoid about cops. I fear them without good reason
176152021,"No no, you’re totally fine. I’ve been there more times than I could count. Sometimes excuses are valid. I was just thinking the only advice I have to get is get some security cameras weekend notifications and sleep with the monitors. That’s what I do. I have a security cameras in my living room and little LED’s bedroom and I get notifications of any sounds or movement plus I have a constant video feed off little LED’s room right next to my pillow so I can watch it all night long and check it when I get scared. But that’s not really a reasonable thing to do. Lol"
176152022,"well i don’t want to disrespect my parents by changing the name they picked for me, so i’ll probably just live with it."
176152023,I never knew you had a college degree. Good for you.

176152025,"Seriously though, from my experience Caplyta, Vraylar, Abilify, Rexulti are the best for negative symptoms as they dont fully block dopamine, partial dopamine agonists. But they are less effective than Risperdal, Zyprexa and Invega."
176152026,Happened in high school until I basically figured out that it was never requited and I was acting a damn fool. Stopped letting myself feel it after that point.
176152027,"Be strong, my friend"
174380959,can you describe the difference.
176152028,Nah I just have an extensive list of bookmarks on my browser
176152029,well yeah could be that but it happened on abikify too
176152030,Yeah I used to be really scared of the med side effects in the beginning so i stopped taking them when ever i could
174380965,Sounds like you have a good taste of negative symptoms and apathy _PERSON_ is from the meds. I would tell your pych doc about your symptoms.
176152031,Multiple Sclerosis Is? I have burning of the hands and I have problems understanding and sometimes thinking Does anybody have experience with this? Also I am going to go to the hospital sometime in the future It comes and goes I thought it was dystonia but it turns out that dystonia has nothing to do with burning in the hands I’m sure I have to see a neurologist… Honestly we are waiting for my partner to get health insurance so he can put me on his account as well
176152032,"I’ve gone through many names in the past, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ the destroyer, oh merciful llama, eldritch tickle, Bill. But none truely come close to the horror I hold within my true name.

176152033,really nice to hear you feeling better =)
176152034,Yes definitely. I have tried university more times than I can count on my fingers. Only managed a little bit of success the first time.
176152035,You sure? (151515)

176152038,I think you should talk to your nurse and let them know you are really struggling Maybe get an earlier appointment to see psychiatrist
176152039,Yea man I remember this. Concentric vs Eccentric contractions.
176152040,Feeling out of sorts. I’ve been rapid cycling the last couple of days. Was feeling a bit delusional as well. Maybe I’ll call my pdoc tomorrow. I don’t want it to get out of hand.
174380964,"Sounds like psychosis to me. Personally I would try other meds, the ones that regulate dopamine instead of blocking it, Abilify, Vraylar and Rexulti. What’s the problem with your current meds?"
176152041,I’m starting to believe I was fed that bs because they are insistent on trying other meds first. As for the other guy he probably had a court order to take it and that was his death sentence (other side of the country).
176152042,Synchronicity in synchronicity? I just recollected a quote called… 66914749ffb3c641d4e53332c8971ed6850×400 34.8 KB Guess what it was said by _NAME_ who defined synchronicity word. Cannot be In sync but knowing the relation is fun until its becomes serious issue.

176152048,"Like Orthomolecular psychiatry is a pseudo science and most likely a fraud at best. I tried mega vitamin doses for 6+ months, no change in my mental health although the internet research says scz has been cured by a guy Dr _NAME_ since the 50’s. Spent a few years of hope in this direction, I can’t remember most of it but I got right into it. Globally searching for someone to help me as I couldn’t cope with med side effects and also was getting toxicity. Blah blah, so tired. Nothing came out of this route for me personally but I was desperate. In fact I’m quite pissed that someone can claim a cure and in fact it’s ineffective information."

When I was in the Marine Corps and still flying and they had the space shuttle I put in an application. They never called. Mostly fighter pilots got the astronaut job but one female astronaut was a helicopter pilot. I forget her name. I wanted to fly it. Not do research.

We can take you out of that situation if you are.” I know the doctors have to ask these types of questions…I understand that.

So I’m listening to my girl’s concerns, and I’m actually agreeing with her."
176152059,"No, of course you wouldn’t. Nor would you criticize a two year old for the way she treats her dolly. That just messes her mind up for later life."
176152060,Not sure. I think experimenting with supplements. Cogentin helped too.
174380976,I would be very careful about trying supplements unless they are given by your pdoc. There are 10 things you might know about a supplement and 10 things you wont know about them because some supplements are not gone through clinical trials and are not approved by FDA. You might find it helpful for now but do you know its long term effects ? And you wont even know some side effects unless you have symptoms. Its just like clozapine. It was banned initially when it killed some people due to infections developed cuz of low wbc counts. Later it got approved with special instruction to measure blood counts when people are on this medicine.

176152064,Frankly you know me very well. I know that I do that. Get mad at myself. Call myself weak. A part of me knows that it’s not true. But a louder part says that it is. I’ve been trying to work on that but it’s hard. I think I’m gonna use this as a way to really focus on the fact that I’m not weak and that its okay to rest. I’m gonna start with the not weak part as I think that part will be easier than the convincing myself that its okay to recharge and that there’s nothing wrong with it. I’ve already kind of started by comparing what’s going on now compared to what happened in the past. To show that it feels like I’m going backwards but I’m still leagues ahead of where I used to be. So I’m strong because I’m still moving forward. It’s a start. Right now I’m doing good with it. In an hour sim sure I’ll feel weak then I’ll have to keep correcting myself and then I’ll feel good again. I’ll get there eventually.

174380974,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Methamphetamine use and antipsychotic-related extrapyramidal side-effects in patients with psychotic disorders. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of dual diagnosis, Jan 26 2020 Objective: Extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSE) are frequent in patients treated with antipsychotics and comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs). Methamphetamine has been shown to act as a dopaminergic neurotoxin. We aimed to determine whether EPSE occur more often in patients with psychotic disorders and co-occurring methamphetamine (MA) use disorders, and we examined the relationship between MA use, antipsychotic type, dose and EPSE. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of data from three separate primary studies. Across all studies, psychiatric and SUD diagnoses were determined using the SCID-I for DSM-IV. EPSE were determined using the Simpson-_NAME_ Scale (SAS) for Parkinsonism, the Barnes Akathisia Rating scale (BARS), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) fo
r tardive dyskinesia. Participants were classified as having any EPSE if they scored above the cutoff on any of the EPSE scales (SAS, BARS, AIMS). We analyzed data using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The sample included 102 patients with non-affective or affective psychotic disorders. Of the total sample, 65.7% were male, 54.9% had schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 20.5% bipolar type I disorder with psychotic features, 11.7% schizoaffective disorder and 12.7% had substance-induced psychosis. A diagnosis of a methamphetamine use disorder (abuse or dependence) was present in 25.5% of participants. EPSE occurred in 38.2% of patients and were significantly associated with MA use in the unadjusted and adjusted analysis, ORadj?=?4.01, 95% CI [1.07, 14.98], p?=?.039. Patients with MA dependence and MA use >3 years were significantly more likely to have EPSE. We found a significant interaction effect between MA use disorders and standardized antipsychotic dose on the occurrence of EPSE, ORadj?=
?1.01, 95% CI [1.00, 1.01], p?=?.042, with MA users having a disproportionally higher likelihood of having EPSE compared to MA non-users as antipsychotic dosage increased. There were no significant associations of EPSE with comorbid alcohol, cannabis, or methaqualone use disorders. Conclusions: Patients with a MA use disorder were significantly more likely to have EPSE with evidence for a dose-response effect. Clinicians should carefully titrate antipsychotic dosage from lower to higher doses to avoid EPSE in patients with MA use disorders."

Its weird never thoght I would have these thoughts there really smart and good at predicting stuff and setting up sycronisities. Its weird they say iam the only person ever that couldn’t quit ciggs bu let I see people smoking all the time. Then they say that iam going to hell forever for it and try to lord over every aspect of my life and make the biggest deal out of everything it sucks. They say they have the power to take me to hell forever and are really confident about it. Some of the voices that I hear the voices say it’s my family trying to help me in some sort of test that suposibly every one went though and pasted except for m
e it sucks they say they are the egiptions and test every one almost after death for eternal life. I always ask who are they to test me. They always say that iam stupid for smoking and not believing in them but the the things they say is crazy and my friends and family say that it’s not real and they cant really do any thing to me. It’s crazy they seem to make things happen on the news to send me a message and say iam the center of attention for an evil society that likes to tourture for fun.

I had my first delusion of thinking people could hear my thoughts when I was eight. When I was nine I started thinking people were watching me all the time. Those two delusions were there all the time but it wasn’t until I was sixteen that I started having hallucinations in addition to delusions and got diagnosed. I find it interesting that there was such a long period between my delusions and hallucinations and that I started having symptoms so young. Not only is it very rare but I’m a woman and in women it’s even rarer to my understanding. I’ve heard that for women the age of onset is usually older than men. I wish that was the case for me. I wish it had occurred to me that my delusions weren’t normal before I started hearing voices. I might have gotten treatment and never started hearing voices to begin wi

I wouldn’t say it’s wise to push multiple drugs on a person at one time. Especially for a disease like alcoholism. They will become rebellious. But I started this naltrexone dec of 2015. It helped a lot. But then in June of 2017 I started Zoloft. And now I literally don’t drink more than 1-2 beers every trimester of the year. The combo of Zoloft+naltrexone is way better than naltrexone alone. I literally just cannot stomach alcohol on this med combo. My friend even said ssris and Antipsychotics combo stopped him from drinking for 8 months. But now he’s back to old ways. I gotta go. Good luck to us all. I have therapy. Now ttyl!!!"

We were talking about the death of his father and how that impacted him and how long it took him to move on. He was saying it took years to recover to normal again, but almost every day he still missed him. He said there is so much he wanted to tell him and wish he could. He said there was a lot of issues between them and he now understood that the reason why he was so hard on him was because he wanted him to succeed more than the others. He said he would constantly call him stupid and put him down and that anything he ever did was never good enough. He said he resented him for that and thought about killing himself.

Now that she passed away I’ve gotten scared because I have felt relief she is not around anymore, and felt guilty because I am glad she’s not in my life anymore. Now I started thinking that she’s cursing me from the grave and God will punish me, and that I killed her with my thoughts.

After the provincial government had their press release, my mom was telling me about this and said, “What if your history of sz shows up, and they will watch you?” I SERIOUSLY hoped this was a delusion.

If I tried to make art right now I’d probably just punch a hole through the canvas or destroy all my works. But that would really hurt my husband because he loves my pieces so I won’t. I want to make an impact on people’s lives and make them happy through my art. I’m really trying to express something in the world. I would say one piece out of every ten I make I actually enjoy. Other people enjoy five out of every ten. See the disparity? I’m my own worst critic. I’m not sure there is another person in the world who hates my art more than myself. Perhaps that’ll give me an advantage when I actually sell some. I’m reading a book on loving yourself more. Today nothing feels like it works. Sorry for ranting. Sometimes it helps.

174381024,There’s a way through that takes accepting the strange. Once I was comfortable with the revelation that the there are peculiar sciences at play and that our world doesn’t know everything my anxiety went away taking most of the audio experiences with it. I believe in telepathy but I’m pretty sure none of the genuine interactions are intended to be hostile; I suspect it’s something more like accidentally crossing wires with another party’s conversation while on the phone; sometimes when the chemical balance is off we are hearing (and sometimes seeing) with someone else’s eyes / ears - overhearing what is being said to or around them. Ultimately I came to the conclusion that it wasn’t about believing or not believing in Weird but learning more about Weird and how Weird may not be a ‘bad’ thing but just simply a glitch in the system of life.

Psychologically tired, but mentally and physically not. Had a slight ideation of hurting this coworker… to a point of… I don’t want to say it but killing… because he is triggering to me. He talks a lot and it gets to me. Then followed by a sort of a confused state, where my brain seemed to feel like I couldn’t think and blocked. I’ve made it through the day, but this feeling I got is it a Brief psychosis? Or merely just my new finding of the emotion of being “psychotic”?

176152278,I was so close to ending up in jail because I did my own thing with my meds. I ended up in a couple of mental facilities and got on a court order for meds. I don’t mess around now. What this group is doing will probably benefit you or a loved one.
176152279,"I’m not interested in any other meds, but thanks… I think it’s not the psychosis. I came off for a while and felt better, went back on, got worse"
176152280,Thanks everyone!
176152281,"Hi all. I’m new here and just wanted to say hi, introduce myself. And to take a peek around honestly to find a path, but howdy hey I’m _NAME_! 22 year old male Ohio, US. I’m diagnosed with quite the heap of things. Skitzoaffective- including mainly a severe disassociation/disconnection with the world around me, depression (manifests as physical) and bi-polar. All with a wonderful coating of icing on that cake being a psycopath. All this has greatly impacted my life for many years now, even looking back I can see the impact but even as today I cannot understand this impact / truely realize it, if that makes any sense. And that’s where I struggle I’m incredibly intelligent (not to toot my own horn but is true) and ive already spent a lot of energy, and effort into being where I am today and extremely functional for the cake that faces me… well… was… but I’m still doing way better then I should all things considered. All this has to be credited to when I was younger and everything st
arted to hit as I developed, leading to early intervention and that’s been a godsend. But that would not last long as I can comfortably look back nearly 2 years and go “here, here is where I started to loose my grip” So where do I stand now? At the gallows if I have to answer that. As inappropriate that is to say I’m not using that as just some funny psychopath joke, well, as much as it may not register how far up shits creek I am, I can fortunately Atleast ‘know’ these things. Back on track it’s not a joke but not serious and this is far from a suicide note?:roll_eyes: because everyone always has to take everything to that situation; and I’ve been unfortunate enough that as much as I want to die (extremely) I’m not suicidal. Perks of not feeling much !!! Anyway… again… it’s more of a literal metaphor I’m using to describe my position. Don’t get it? Well let me explain. I’m quite literally at the end of that rope, as I stand I can see both the sniper on the ol tavern roof ready t
o shoot the rope at the perfect time saving me, and the executioner ready to pull that lever. The executioner being more of a metaphor for descending into madness. And again, that’s not a joke, where I stand, I can see myself being able to easily go down that road, and it’s likely… This is one of the few recent ‘understandings’ I’ve had that have lead me to only faintly realize I’m beyond unhealthy and Something needs to be done… coupled with a growing drug dependency (quite frankly the scariest and most eye opening) and loosing my marbles in the middle of December almost ending me up in the loony bin, and nearly causing my biggest fear, causing harm. Witch I have yet to recover from and have completely pushed it to the side because it’s no big deal. And honestly won’t be surprised if it happens again. Last year I had already done one of the most damaging things I could possibly do and that is to give up care, care for where I’m going with whatever hope, they very last step into madness, 
being a few fingers on that lever to drop that door… I know everyone is going to go “don’t be all doom and gloom that’s unhealthy you shouldn’t see it that way” well… sorry but you’re stupid… the last thing I need right now is to continue to ignore this and start to think it’s rainbows and butterflies, because it’s not… this is actually serious and not your little highschool emo girl “omg I’m sad and shy so my depression and anxiety, give me attention” as someone who has gotten to where they are because thinking everything is rainbows and butterflies I don’t think it’s the time to do that… it’a time to face the music… this can’t be fixed with a smile and a hug. Why can’t people understand that? Anyway ranting… I’m exhausted and have almost nothing to give. This is my last chance, seriously, I’ve been empowered with therapy in the past to help understand myself, and my personal passion for psychology to both understand myself and to use for all that fun psychop
athic activities. So here it is, and I got to say these all important words that fateful night where my marble jar broke… and actually mean it… but no, I am not okay… There is plenty more to talk about but I won’t bore you right now with this already lengthy book I’ve written, which I find soothing for my always 2,000mph racing brain and I’ll be around. Also yes yes, everyone gona autistically screech this too. I just got a big boy job and will have big boy insurance, but not till like February, so I have to hold out. And crutch on my illegal drug issue that is somehow bad because I’m doing things that I would be put on if I had ‘access’ to doctor (and not weed I’m not an edgy pussy?) nono!! That’s bad you shouldn’t do that!!! Um okay?? Probably the only reason I haven’t lost it. Again I’m smart, and responsible and I’m quite frankly here because I have no choice. I certainly don’t want to be here, because remember out of possibly everything that is the single most important dr
ive I have to try prove to me, how bad it really is. Even as I lay here and type this, I feel completely fine, and I know if fine (in my head) but conscious me knows… The mask is crumbling, I am not okay. Ps. Please oh please oh please no pity comments or anything along those lines… thank you. Although I’m a psychopath that craves attention, I don’t about this… congratulations the people you swore to protect? You’re actually harming them, many are forced more into silence to not look like the joke we’ve made of mental health. Please, stop it… I have a feeling this place is a big ol pitty party as any Internet ‘forum’ pertaining to mental health is… why I chose a more specialized, and not _PERSON_ many “joke” about. In hopes to find some ‘aid’. If I went to a depression or general forum, it’s would honestly be both comedy and edge gold… Thank you for coming to my _NAME_ talk, _NAME_ (and _PERSON_… or is it too soon for that…?)"

176152341,"I am gonna recommend looking at a TENS unit on Amazon for about 28 bucks. Order the extra 20 bucks worth of like 48 electrode pads and the extra 10 bucks worth of specific 9 volt batteries. Looking at 60 bucks, but 2 day prime that thing, it’ll help. I use it on my back for arthritis in my lower pelvis and lower back. But you can put those pads anywhere on your back, legs, hips, arms, just not your neck. You control the intensity, pulse, etc. Read up on it, if it’s for you great, if not, maybe in the future. You don’t need a doctor to RX them anymore, and most insurances will give you the same one I described. But charge you a copay of 200-400 dollars if you go thru doctor. My orthopedic surgeon is the one that had a printed page of what one to order."

176152371,It takes time to recover like many other things. It’s hard though. Delusions are so seductive and it’s easy to get lost in that. Still. Keep yourself busy and try and focus on things that you enjoy or help you.
176152372,"I go for a walk and try to clear my head, I have those days all too often."

I guess I’ll give it another shot. I just get frustrated as I don’t see very much results at all but I mean it’s worth a go again I guess.
176152374,"If it were an improvement I wouldn’t know how to handle it. For instance being happy more often would give me less to complain about. I would have to change my entire outlook on life and get into healthy ways of thought and activity. I may have to have a social life and date, and marry and then face the possibility of my spouse and I getting old and grey rather then more likely dying young. Then I’d have to wear Depends for decades and sit there in the nursing home at which point I’d be miserable again. Then I would haunted of memories of being happy rather than being glad I was about to kick the bucket."

176152379,It’s hormone named prolactin. Prolactin is naturally gained while being pregnant. Other means to produce it is to have a brain tumour or by Antipsychotics. The it works is by your body storing as many calories as possible “preparing to feed the fetus” in which case you don’t have and that’s why rapid weight gain happens.

176152382,"We kill each other because we are intelligent, fair, noble, superior beings compared to an animal and each other. Or so we think. Uh, chimpanzees have been known to commit murder. When an alpha male lion takes over a new pride by killing the male lions who ran it, the first thing he’ll do is kill every cub in the pride. The lionesses bow down to his superior size and strength and killing all the cubs of his predecessor brings the lionesses into heat faster and he gets to mate as often as he wants to assure his bloodline is well established. Hyena cubs are known for killing siblings. Merry Christmas, welcome to nature."
176152383,"I don’t feel able to participate in the real world. I don’t know what to do.

In my mid-thirties I unloaded trucks for a living along side a bunch of teenagers and twenty-somethings and I was taking weight training in college and I not only held my own but after I was there a few months I became one of the best, fastest workers on the crew and I was proud of my strength and energy and I thought I looked pretty damn good. But after that job ended my next job as a park ranger was usually not that physical and the old saying is true, “If you don’t use it, you lose it.” So I slowly lost a lot of my muscles and my definition and gained weight. Now I am not in good shape and now I hardly look at my body in the mirror anymore. Sometimes I look a little OK but not much."
176152387,"Allright well i cant go on. A ban is allready probably in the works. Ive been repremanded for talking religion already. If they find out i was always pro religion and anti med, they dsm crew will be out to get me."
176152388,That’s good on you.
176152389,CBD has been proven to be as effective as antipsychotics. I think it’s a lot more effective.
174381061,"I saw several psychiatrists, they said they can’t help me. One just told me the history of antipsychotics and how some patients on APs couldn’t function in society and had negative symptoms. Dr says I have severe negative symptoms."
176152390,Are you sz? Or sza?
176152391,"Other than for stopping drugs, sz is one of the worst diseases, nothing positive about it."
174381060,"I don’t see how a new Dr would help. I have seen 4 psychiatrists as outpatient and 5 inpatient. They couldn’t help. I have tried Abilify, Zyprexa, Latuda, Seroquel, Risperdal and Wellbutrin. We also tried therapy. I have less negative symptoms on partial dopamine agonists like Abilify/Rexulti but for me they cause worse side effects than negative symptoms, addictions and hypersexuality. My only hope is Vraylar as its a partial dopamine agonist that doesn’t cause addictions and hypersexuality according to the FDA unlike Abilify/Rexulti."
176152392,"God did me wrong, So I went to the Devil and, Sold my soul, But at least now I smile, When I ask for forgiveness."
176152393,I get mood swings a lot but mostly my mood is empty and bleak . Not sad just nothingness. …
174381056,I’m researching schizophrenia and I’m determined to understand this illness. How did schizophrenia start out for you? What were the symptoms?
174381058,? switched from risperidone to clozaril and clozaril to invega. Non of them caused relapse on me.
176152394,Are you a fictional character?
176152395,"I don’t, the atypical ones exacerbate my ocd intrusive thoughts. They do that…on the other hand, haldol doesn’t do that as badly, according to an argument posted on _NAME_ nee koch’s site…I was convinced that haldol is the best option of antipsychotics for treating ocd if anything. Also, I get psychotic and manic, its quick and strong. It puts that stuff to rest. I read it can knock you into depression…for that, I’ve got lamotrigine. There’s also less weight gain. On a prn basis, no need to worry about eps…it causes that, an advantage of the much newer atypical antipsychotics is that they don’t do that. Still, haldol is a great drug, I’d reckon, and I wanna talk to my pdoc about it."
176152396,"I have people in my life and at times that can be challenging but solitude is desired so much I can’t relate. But the lonliness I have is being alone in this suffering / journey (outside of clinical supports), so I come to this forum so I can be not alone. Is there a support group you could join or a place to volunteer? I can’t handle volunteering but some people do and it gives them community"
176152397,Lol i take alot things.
174381054,"amisulpride is more effective than quetiapine for overall improvement, its 2nd best after clozapine"
176152398,"I paced alot when i first would be in the psych ward, constantly."
174381067,"Hello _NAME_, long time no see lol"
176152399,I am struggling with motivation too now for a few weeks. Maybe try tackling one room at a time around your house ? Once you start moving the motivation will come.
176152400,i couldnt it was sold out everywhere hopefully i can get on christmas day.
176152401,When i was a kid i believed my mom was replaced by a robot. I heard a few voices. But i didnt develop full blown sza until i was 20 maybe 21. I dont remember fully now.
174381069,"Last year I worked a few months at a job I liked before I got psychosis. I’m a substitute special _NAME_ tutor. Once school starts this August I plan to go back now that I have no more positive symptoms. It happens, but it’s treatable with time and patience. I once considered being a cpa and was told the hours aren’t that bad at least in Hawaii, max is 50 hours per week and that’s only once in a while. Personally I have no ability to work full time anymore. Do what you feel you can handle."
176152402,It’s hard to say unless you try. Medication is a trial and error situation.
174381066,APs really do make them worse. My pdoc says my negatives are worse because of the meds but would i prefer psychosis? So i try to get past the negatives the best i can.
176152403,"Oh, that is not many to choose from to make friends, I guess. . I’d say one out of seven ain’t bad. Or one out of six since you are counting yourself."
176152404,"I mess up every day. Recognizing it is more than some people do, _AT_MENTION_ so you’re ahead of the game at that. Usually, I mess up because I didn’t go with my gut instinct. So, I’m trying to learn to trust me better."
176152405,I found information on a .gov website that talks on synthetic telepathy.
176152406,"Trust me, I know all about TD. I have it. Still not worth it to get off of APs."
176152407,Really sore. Physical therapy has been kicking my butt this week. What about you?
174381064,had anyone find their sexual orientation is actually homosexual had they taken the meds?
176152408,Dont see it .I just googled it. Never heard of anyone getting brain tumors from it.
176152409,you can give some clothing away?
176152410,Today they tell me it’s from 430 pm to 9 pm four nights a week. Yesterday it was 5 to 9. I don’t get off of work until 430. I don’t think I could do that with no break. I want the certificates and I don’t like working for the IRS. Want a new job. Sounds like too much. I don’t think I could make it to 4 months doing that. If I was still on SSDI I would do it but with working that just sounds too tough. With my work I have access to a site that says you can get PMP certified for free. It would probably take a lot of self discipline to do it by myself but I could do it during working hours probably and get paid for it. I was supposed to get my work laptop back today. The IT lady shipped it next day air yesterday with UPS but I still don’t have it. Will investigate this more when I can get on my work computer.
176152411,"Its the illness, I used to have the same fears and hallucinations. Are you very religious?"
176152412,"I don’t have external voices but I do hear things. I have more visual hallucinations than most on here I think. This disease is a complicated one. Do you mind if I ask your gender and age? Just curious. Also, I’m posting a lot because I’m board, not trying to butt into all of your conversations. Feel free to tell me to butt out"
176152413,"Good morning, sunlion. Whats up?"
176152414,"Sounds like a good job to test the waters with. Take it easy and don’t overwhelm yourself. Me, I worry about how the voices would affect my work."
176152415,Seeing as I’ve been so stable recently the next appointment is in 6 months time. It was just a 5 minute phone call.
176152416,Nobody can see you.
176152417,I can go 24 hours. That’s it.
176152418,Or does it just end up being like a dog walking on their hind legs. I.e. unnatural. Have you tried forcing yourself to do stuff?
176152419,Thanks for all the advice yeah I do it but I feel my body doesn’t release melatonin like its suppose to lol
176152420,Are Radio songs the only ones telling the truth now in the Media?
176152421,At what point does My feeling stupid Turn into Actually being stupid?
176152422,"That’s Strange. Maybe Turn Your Lights On, (If They’re Off), And Meditate Clear Thoughts."
176152423,Sorry for you and your families loss.
176152424,To a certain degree yes but not by much and it doesn’t last long.
176152425,"Mild chance for the SZ, excellent chance for the _PERSON_’s."
176152426,Honestly I function and look and act like someone with an IQ of 20-40 though. I can do calculus and program a little though. Can’t really cook or take care of myself. I’m socially immature.

174381070,You know it’s impossible.
176152428,"I make a conscious effort to obey the laws, I think many people easily justify breaking the law, and considering the laws are not openly taught in america unless you join the police or go to law school, I think many are unaware they are breaking a law til they get arrested or fined."
176152429,Hey. Pays to tell them you’ve sz and you have trouble filling out forms. They usually have allowances or third parties for helping you with social security. You just need to ask questions and find someone to help you if you can’t do it… It’s no slight. My mother was my advocate and used to have the power to deal with social security for me. If you don’t have someone then it’s no fault of yours. Hold your ground and make them aware of your shortcomings. Sz will make you disorganized. It’ll make your memory not work etc… You shouldn’t be punished for not filling out forms with sz. That would be my approach. Be honest but let them know you struggle.
176152430,"Well I finally got my permission to take the board exam and my graduate nurse license. I was so excited for that. But now I realize my little vacation is over. I have to start studying for my nursing license test. I have to start looking for jobs and going about that whole process. I am really anxious and unhappy. I don’t know why…I am so excited to have my first job and be independent and I know I will do well on the exam. I think I am just upset I cant spend the days how I want anymore and also because the job search process gives me immense stress, particularly interviews."
176152431,"I just bought gummy worms the other day too! It’s not 5 pounds, but still. Congratulations on your worms!"
176152432,"Quixotic, I am wondering about the clothing of the body and the word, who are you, who am I;?; I have thought that you are at once my Shiatsu teacher, _PERSON_, my _PERSON_ companion, _PERSON_, and my _PERSON_ teacher, _PERSON_. Is this true, can it be true, does it matter if whatever we believe is the truth;?; Please respond in kind, who are you, who am I;?; Thank you."
176152433,"yeah but i’m just saying if people are not taught the proper p’s and Q’s then its up to other people like me and you to call them out, probably works better on dare i say it? ‘normal people’"
176152434,I think coffee can cause anxiety. Some users here say that.
176152435,Then you probably have schizophrenia.
176152436,It sounds bad…just by the name. I dont believe that stuff. Put positive stuff in ya. Good luck.
176152437,Im waiting for my turn haha…
176152438,"I mean, time to the longest remission"
176152439,"Yeah…I’m not sure why they charge you so much. I go to a state-sponsered counseling program because the suicide rates have risen from the last year. However, we pay about 25-30 dollars per 30 minute sessions. Unfortunately the office is not accessible."
176152440,"Your voice matters, _AT_MENTION_ . Thank you for speaking out."
176152441,"And my mom once told me that I was attacked physically for hours because I spoke Spanish to a Spanish speaking man. Moms aren’t always right. We love them, but they can be wrong"
176152442,what i liked about him was he was the personality i like. and also he knew i had a mental health problem. i don’t have to go through all the beginning stages of trying to explain why i live with my mom and my problems and my weight i’ve gained. and if they’ll accept me. i think too i know it isn’t realistic. liking him is safe. because it’s not going to happen. i just thought of that.
176152443,Headaches and being very irritated about any kind of effort required of me.

176152446,I just think my diagnosis is wrong
176152447,I feel the same way you do. I have just given up on working. I get bullied on the job. I am slow due to my meds. Just the thought of working really stresses me out. I am socially awkward and just don’t want to be around people. Don’t stress too much about working. If you have an income just take it easy and do what you love.
176152448,They could make the birds sound like hell or make music sound sad
176152449,I think it’s paranoia too. Don’t let it get to you. I get this kind of paranoia but mine is so strong I dont even want to be with a man. I wonder if aps can do this to us. It was never like this before for me. But I think you’re fine.

176152457,My profound sleep seems a little bit affected with dark chocolate.
176152458,You seem very lucid and intelligent to me. I think that IQ can vary among us sz’s. I’m very skeptical that you have an IQ of just 69. I think IQ is over rated anyway.
176152459,Do you know how you are going to pay for your mortgage?
176152460,Yes that does happen to me. And I hate it. But with the right amount of anti psychotics it will lessen a lot to the point you can cope with it It’s very haunting and it’s scary when it happens because it happens to me off guard Please research the ect option before you do it.

176152502,Wat do they say to you
176152503,Yes ecstasy is terrible too and I did that a lot thinking all the while that I was invincible. All drugs are bad and contributed to my undoing although my psychiatrist tells me not to blame myself. It does no good.
176152504,Weight gain and restlessness. I grew out of a lot of clothes. I also can’t get comfortable with being restless.
176152506,The med I took the longest was Geodon. After about a year smiling and fun all started coming back. I took it another year and then it stopped working and all that time I was on the highest dose so I couldn’t take more.

It did when I was growing up lol."
176152545,I dont understand why it cant be both. Some people are very controlling and environment certainly plays a factor. While other people or environments are more liberating.

176152555,"You can always call the national phone number for Social Security and see what the rules are for assets. It’s _PHONE_NO_. Common sense is that if you are collecting SSDI every month they’re not going to allow someone to have a large sum of money in the bank. I don’t know offhand what the cutoff point is for having money in the bank or cash on hand but just to pick a number out of thin air, you can’t have $10,000 dollars in the bank or cash on hand and still get SSDI. I just made that number up, it could be $2000, $5000 or $6000 or some other figure. IP Incidentally, a car is not counted as assets. You can have a car and not get penalized for it. Generally, the rule for programs like Medicaid or maybe if you’re collecting Social Security, require you to notify them of any changes. Stuff like if you move, or you get a job or lose a job, or you buy or sell or get rid of a car, if you get a large sum of money from somewhere, etc. Calling the national number is kind of a hassle; you could be o

IDK, you’re on the right track though, maybe there’s some witch doctor in some tribe that no one knows about deep in the Amazon rain forest who discovered he can extact the sweat glands from a flying squirrel and cram it in a schizophrenics nose and let it stay there for four months and after four months.then the schizophrenic is completely cured. It’s possible. See the problem with alternative treatments is that they can’t find one that works for the majoriry. The treatment may help a couple people but it doesn’t work for the rest of us. I mean even lobotomies worked for a few people. So did vitimun therapy. But meds are proven to work for large numbers of people so that’s why doctors prescibe them.

I also find that if think something negative about someone, it has actual negative repercussions. Like the person will actually get upset with me. They say or do something mean towards me, and I end up feeling embarrassed, but all I did was think something about them. Because of this, I feel like I have no freedom in my mind. No privacy.

I think it will likely cause trouble though if one partner wants sex and the other wants a relationship.

176152663,"Right now I’m taking Zyprexa and Vraylar. For me Invega and Zyprexa are not weight neutral, but every antipsychotic has different effects for every different person out there. Zyprexa makes a lot of people gain weight, however, for some people it is weight neutral. I would suggest you try a different antipsychotic, starting with the ones that have a higher chance of being weight neutral - no guarantees, though. I would advise starting with something like Vraylar, Latuda, Geodon. Oh, and also, make sure to talk to your doctor before starting any of these meds!"
176152664,Was it a helpful experience? Did you regret it or was it a relief?

176152670,I take a zyprexa wafer. Dissolves under the tongue and gets in your bloodstream quicker and out of the stomach so better for the weight gain supposedly. You on benzo’s? Let them dissolve under your tongue and same thing. It’s in your bloodstream quicker and your helping that anxiety. We only gain by these sorts of delivery methods. May not work for everyone but if it keeps up to tolerances in your blood it’s all good.

176152672,"I’m with _AT_MENTION_. Save up for those vet bills! Our dog is generally healthy, but her most recent bill cost over $1000 because she had a dental cleaning, and they did a free growth removal at the same time as an add-on. Little dogs are notorious for bad teeth. My dog didn’t need any teeth pulled, just cleaning and tests beforehand to ensure her heart enzymes and CBC were good. The only people I know of who keep shih tzu hair long show them. They have to wrap their hair to avoid it from getting damaged or from messing with the dog. (See pic). It takes a lot of care to keep hair long like that. And definitely listen to what others have said about mats and grooming. I’d recommend a groomers ever six weeks, but that’s just what I plan to do when I get my Bichon Frise. Brush daily, brush teeth, watch for mats, feed decent food. On the food note, be careful not to fall into the trap of feeding a food that seems too good. I used to spend about $58 for a 15 lb. bag of food only to learn it caus
ed elevated heart enzymes that could lead to death. I had my dog tested, and while her heart enzymes are elevated, she has no damage to her heart (we had an echo done on her to be sure). Now we feed middle-of-the-road food, Iams. Her treats are Science Diet dog food for healthy teeth, and she loves them. My girl is a 45 lb. dog. We brush her once a week, take her to the groomer every four weeks for $50 (though that is only bath and brush without shaving), and we have her nails done every two weeks, alternating between the groomer’s and a dremel at home. Her food runs about $15/month. Her heartworm preventative (a necessity here in the states!) runs me $120 for the year, and her flea & tick preventative is $48 a year since I only use it during the spring/early summer. Our community treats for fleas and ticks, so we don’t really get them. Her annual vet visit- dentals and echocardiograms aside- cost about $150-200. This is just to give you an idea of what you’re getting into. I hope I haven’t written to

176152714,The book I’m reading right now. Snapchat-_PHONE_NO_.jpg 1427×2688 758 KB
176152715,Basically I had well-rounded dysfunctional sensory and perceptory disorders. I had vision damage. I somehow managed to over-come DP/DR distortions but became more paranoid and disabled (possibly) by getting out of my mind and head. I took supplements but still have the philosophical and ocd lingering effects.
176152716,"I think it’s a complex question that has an individual case by case definition Just as I was turning 17, I had psychosis and my social functioning (Was rubbish anyway), was severely disrupted and it has never recovered since then Occupationally, I was on track to go pretty far in academia, but my potential was once again beaten down by psychosis. This impairment destroyed the path I was on, and even though I tried to restart this, my 8 year hiatus means I am dreadfully out of date and behind. This is a consequence of my mental instability. With my work as an analyst, I got to a point where I could no longer function in this role, as the family support evaporated, and I had no one giving me leeway to be off to recover from the stress and psychosis. My potential for this role could have been astronomical had I not had the mental health issues and coping strategies to deal with all this pressure and cognition to learn new skills. Where I stand now is that I am doing a physical job, that’s low stre
ss (For the most part), and with self employed freedoms that come with that. I feel more able to manage now. Going back to the severe functional impairment. My level of functioning where it is now could be considered respectable by many standards imagined by a professional etc. However, I do feel robbed of the potential that I had growing up - and into early adulthood, and feel that a lot of what I could have achieved was wasted in a mass of drugs, psychosis and dealing with the aftermath of some pretty serious situations. That for me is how my functionality has been what I would deem as severe impairment. Everything has been such a battle. Even though it feels like it has been won with relative stability for a couple of years, the damage caused is lasting, and I will probably never recover it before I die. I will still resist, and push on."

I tried to avoid sleep then but don’t remember how that worked. Okay. I am going to try what up to have done. (One night I did get 8 hrs so my Fitbit was satisfied with that) I’ve tried yoga one night and I think it helped. I am working on returning to that practice because I love it but had issues with focusing. I will try meditation as well to see if that calms me down so I can (maybe) sleep well. I get frustrated when I am told I am being irrational. Maybe it was because my CNP was putting it, mater of factly, that I will not be decreasing meds because of the fear/avoidance of sleep. Thank you for the suggestion. I see, especially today that it is very hard to keep up this sleep thing. I’m having issues with it right now but I had no one to real

174381143,"I fell in love once with a wonderful woman who also happened to have mental illness. She suffers from borderline personality disorder and PTSD, while I suffer from schizophrenia. It was one hell of a _USER_ID_ ride and definitely changed me and her forever. We have a son together, who is almost five years old now. Her and I tried keeping the relationship alive, but stabilizing the crazy intense ups and downs eventually exhausted both of us. Neither one of us was getting better mentally and it had to come to an ugly and confusing end when she kicked me out of our apartment. Our son stays with her and my only hope for survival on my own turned out to be Invega _PERSON_ (a long-acting injection). Emotionally destroyed after the end of our romance, then the end of our relationship, then the end of our friendship, I ended up in the hospital several times, almost completing suicide three times. She was hospitalized once after a suicide attempt. I’m including a photo of me in the resulting coma after a 
very large overdose of Seroquel. What started as love both produced these terrible events and one amazing one… Our son. His name is _PERSON_ and nothing, not even schizophrenia, will get in my way of protecting him, guiding him, and loving him with the intensity that I had once loved his mother. Mental illness can’t stop any of us from falling in love. I think we all have the capacity to match with someone in a loving embrace. 13816768_1044554858967598_706610071_n.jpg 540×960 56 KB The love was worth the pain."

174381161,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [Post-traumatic stress disorder in reaction to psychotic experience: A systematic revue]. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Very, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, L'Encephale , Sep 2019 11 The update of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5) emphasizes the definition of psychological traumatism as an objective and external event. Nevertheless, the scientific debate about the criteriology of PTSD, its clinical pertinence for application and the role of subjective dimension appears still open. Although the relation between psychotrauma and psychosis has been well examined, in the way of trauma as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia, the potential traumatism represented by the psychotic experience seems to be less known.This paper aims to provide a state of the art about the PTSD in reaction to psychosis, defined as PTSD post psychosis (PTSD-PP), particularly in epidemiological and psychopathol
ogical terms.We performed a bibliographic research on Pubmed using the keywords ""post-traumatic stress disorder"", ""psychological trauma"", ""schizophrenia review"", ""psychosis"", ""first episode psychosis""« », ""recovery schizophrenia"", with a first screening on titles and abstracts. An acute psychotic episode referred to a decompensation of any pathology of the DSM5-schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders or to a mood disorder with psychotic features. The articles exclusively interested in the traumatic impact of hospitalizations and treatment conditions were excluded.The literature noted that PTSD-PP affected about a quarter to a third of the psychotic patients interrogated during the recovery of an acute psychotic episode. The analytic epidemiology showed that the main validated risk factors for PTSD were also relevant in the development of PTSD-PP, including past traumatic history, childhood trauma and feeling of helplessness during the traumatic event. Criticizing the methodological h
eterogeneity through studies, the observational approach brought out the lack of clinical pertinence of the DSM5A criteria defining the traumatic event for PTSD. This criteriology failed to consider the subjective dimension of the threat to psychological integrity generated by a psychotrauma. Historical case studies presented a complete post-traumatic symptomatology in reaction to psychosis, suggesting that the supposed psychotic residual symptoms after acute phase could referr to actual traumatic reactions. The PTSD-PP process observed in descriptive research and patients' interviews appeared congruent with the cognitive model of PTSD elaborated by _PERSON_ and _NAME_. Indeed, psychotic patients developed negative appraisals about themselves, others and the world because of the occurrence and the content of their psychotic symptoms. Shame, fear of recurrence, intolerance to uncertainty and perception of losing control of one's mind were demonstrated as significantly related to PTSD-PP. A perception of curren
t threat then settled, leading to adaptation strategies, possibly psychotic themselves, to avoid intrusions and others indices about their past psychotic episode. Thus, reliving syndrome, avoidance, emotional numbing could simulate a new psychotic exacerbation to an outer-observer.A psychotic experience could be traumatic for patients and lead to complete PTSD. Although it appears as a non-consensual clinical entity, from a likely epistemological slip of the definition of ""psychotrauma"", the consideration of potential PTSD-PP presents an undoubted clinical relevance. Indeed, it could help practioners to precise the semiological analysis of patients recovering from an acute psychotic episode; to impact the prognosis of psychosis, thinking about impairment on the quality of life and the affective and suicidal comorbidities; and to modify the therapeutic approach in the recovery of schizophrenia. In addition, the literature about psychotic recovery seems particularly related to the concept of ""post-traumatic 
growth"" (PTG). The inscription of a psychotic episode in a traumatic frame requires a clinical approach as close as possible to the subjectivity of the patient experience, beyond the evaluation of psychotic symptoms and its remission. The question of trauma-focused therapies applied to PTSD-PP opens the field for future research."
176152824,"The way it works here in _NAME_ is that if you get involuntarily committed by trial (it’s a quick 5-minute informal trial that can take place wherever) you lose the right to own a gun in the commonwealth of _NAME_. I don’t know what I’d be charged with if someone found me with one. Of course I don’t plan on buying or carrying a gun, because I don’t trust myself with it when I’m depressed. That’s probably the question, why do you feel the need to own a gun? Do you ever see yourself actually using it? Keep in mind that using it means someone is going to the hospital or the grave from being shot by it, and you’d have to live with that and possibly get arrested and go to prison because of the shooting. All these things you have to consider before you get into owning a gun for whatever reason. If I were you I’d just not own any. There’s very little usefulness in it."

The relationship of performance errors with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) rs4680 (Val158Met) genotype (Met carriers vs. Val homozygotes) on test performance before and after antipsychotic treatment in 32 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients was examined. After treatment, patients demonstrated a mixture of beneficial and adverse cognitive outcomes that varied in relation to COMT genotype. Met carriers showed decreased perseverative and regressive errors, reflecting improved cognitive flexibility and enhanced stability of behavioral preferences, 
respectively. In contrast, Val homozygotes exhibited an increase in regressive errors after treatment. These findings suggest that Val homozygotes may be vulnerable to adverse effects of antipsychotic medication on cognitive processes that maintain consistent adaptive response preferences, an ability linked to the striatum in rodent models.

Then I got home and was very violently attacked. They got pissed off when their seduction tactics weren’t working and they literally just forcibly sedated me and started molesting me. I was so terrified and upset. My boyfriend got home from work just then and interrupted it. They wouldn’t let me move to greet him. I was so scared. Finally he helped pull me up to a sitting position and I could hear the demons curse at me as they moved off.

You may need some basic statistics background to understand what the values mean but it’s easy to get a good idea of effectiveness with a basic understanding.

When I look at a drug or a therapy this is the approach I take.

Previous studies have found an association between urinary tract infection (UTI) and acute psychosis. We investigated the prevalence and correlates of UTI in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia.We estimated the prevalence of UTI at the baseline visit of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) schizophrenia trial. We then investigated associations between UTI and inflammatory markers, psychopathology, and cognition, controlling for potential confounding factors.The prevalence of probable UTI at baseline in the CATIE trial was 1.2% (n = 13 of 1,061 participants). Compared wit
h participants with a normal urinalysis (n = 387), after controlling for potential confounders, UTI was a significant predictor of greater impairments (approximately 1 standard deviation difference) in the cognition composite score (beta = -0.153, P = .002), and poorer working memory (beta = -0.190, P < .001). There were no differences in psychopathology scores between participants with probable UTI and those with a normal urinalysis.Urinary tract infections in patients with schizophrenia may have an impact on cognition. Findings provide additional evidence regarding infectious disease comorbidity, which may be clinically relevant in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia."

Surely my experiences during those 10 years should have been the main consideration in his diagnosis; which I think it was. This is the part of the abstract I’m basing my comment on: “The definition and assessment of the ‘experienced’ symptoms of schizophrenia, only directly observed and reported by the patients, represent a specific, crucial, irreplaceable domain of psychopathology, to be carefully distinguished from the domain of the ‘behavioral’ symptoms observed by the clinician.”"

174381203,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Exercise ameliorates deficits in neural microstructure in a Disc1 model of psychiatric illness. _NAME_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Magnetic resonance imaging , May 2019 16 Recent studies have investigated the effectiveness of aerobic exercise to improve physical and mental health outcomes in schizophrenia; however, few have explicitly explored the impact of aerobic exercise on neural microstructure, which is hypothesized to mediate the behavioral changes observed. Neural microstructure is influenced by numerous genetic factors including DISC1, which is a major molecular scaffold protein that interacts with partners like GSK3?, NDEL1, and PDE4. DISC1 has been shown to play a role in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, neuronal maturation, and synaptic signaling. As with other genetic variants that present an increased risk for disease, mutations of the DISC1 gene have been implicated in the molecular intersection of schizophrenia and numerous other major psychi
atric illnesses. This study investigated whether short-term exercise recovers deficits in neural microstructure in a novel genetic Disc1 sv?2 rat model. Disc1 sv?2 animals and age- and sex-matched controls were subjected to a treadmill exercise protocol. Subsequent ex-vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) compared neural microstructure in regions of interest (ROI) between sedentary and exercise wild-type animals and between sedentary and exercise Disc1 sv?2 animals. Short-term exercise uncovered no significant differences in neural microstructure between sedentary and exercise control animals but did lead to significant differences between sedentary and exercise Disc1 sv?2 animals in neocortex, basal ganglia, corpus _USER_ID_, and external capsule, suggesting a positive benefit derived from a short-term exercise regimen. Our findings suggest that Disc1 sv?2 animals are more sensitive to the effects of short-term exercise and highlight the ameliorati
ng potential of positive treatment interventions such as exercise on neural microstructure in genetic backgrounds of psychiatric disease susceptibility."
176152966,"It can be easy to start to see your therapy as punishment in disguise. It’s a trap you need to fight, because it is a short step from thinking your pdoc is abusing you to thinking your parents and your teachers are abusing you. Sometimes I think the doctors do throw up their hands in frustration and say, “Let’s get some psychotropic drugs in them and see how that works.” The better you talk to your pdoc the better treatment you will get. Be assertive, not aggressive. Don’t be too headstrong. Listen to your pdoc. You don’t have to agree with everything they say, but you should at least consider it. If it doesn’t work for you, tactfully tell your pdoc how you feel about it. You can’t expect too much of pdoc’s in the public health system. They have a lot of responsibilities, and they can’t always give the quality of care they would like to give."

176152978,"Okay, I thought about it more, and I think that I am using some sort of simple economic analysis of the situation (correctly or not). That is to say… I would be inclined to believe that an ex romantic partner might stalk you since he or she might want to avoid all the effort and money required in getting out there, making contact, going on dates, self disclosing, exposing ones body, showing ones weaknesses. Thus for that person a cost benefit analysis suggests (to me at least) that driving 45 minutes would make sense. I am very disinclined to believe that a psychopath would be bothered to drive 45 minutes to intimidate you because you had dissed his mother. He could get his jollies punching people in a local pub. And he could intimidate you far more easily (please see below). I am very inclined to think that this is paranoia since, as _AT_MENTION_ says very succinctly and persuasively in post #9 “You only think that because you have a disease. You are not the center of someone else’s world. E
veryone is the center of their own world. They care about taking care of themselves and making themselves happy. Nobody puts this much effort into bothering someone else.” However, if your parent and x-colleague really are members of a secret army (which, I am sorry, I can not but doubt a little) then it might conceivably be possible that they would want to ,keep an eye on you to ensure that you do not blow the whistle on them. I would say it is of a very low possibility since putting the scare on you by (as they seem to have done) simply telling your cousin that you should watch out, is a much more economical way of making you scared.

Now, 4 years have passed since my last relapse and now I am relatively stable. I acknowledge all of the bad things I did during psychosis and I truly have remorse over them. Now I know that I should never have done those things. The thing is, I keep reliving my past mistakes and I want to self-harm because of it to punish myself. I apologized to all of the people that I’ve ruined, and I know that I didn’t get in trouble with the law. The police know me from bringing me to the hospital and they would have arrested me if I did violate the law. I keep thinking about how stupid I am and I beat myself up for my stupidity. I hate myself because I did bad things during my psychotic episodes, and I hate myself so much. I feel like I am not trustworthy and I feel like I am defined by my mistake. I can’t escape from what I did. What should I do? Should I talk to my doctor about th

176152995,"I watched this movie, a ‘beautiful mind’ and I realized the main protagonist _NAME_ was portrayed as the outsider before he became schizophrenic. Anyways, I used it to measure my own lifestyle before schizophrenia and I realize, I was never one of those charismatic friends. To understand what I mean, you have to understand something about _NAME_; long before _NAME_ started hearing voices, he actually was mad in the form of delusional understandings/thinking, and looking back at my teenage years, I realized I was also delusional before I started hearing voices; an example of this would be - I’d be in a mall, and I would just have this feeling I shouldn’t go near certain people, or use the elevator etc (just irrational things and looking back, they were always stupid things, but I’d always listened)… and I say this because these irrational thoughts/understandings never existed in my mind until I joined highschool and there I was always an outcast - my classmates singled me out because I h
ad cancer chicks/made fun of it(did chemo before I joined school so my face was bloated, a common side effect of chemotherapy). Anyways, before that happened, I never had delusional/irrational thoughts, but after a year of being alone/an outcast to my classmates, I started having that delusional mindset… So four years pass and I’ve naturalized those delusional thoughts as normal - and at one point I even told myself I was having them because of all the cancer medications I was given after chemo. Then the 5th years comes, and I become schizophrenic… Like we’re those delusional thoughts just a coincidence or did you all go through them before you started hearing voices? And specifically, are they born out of being outcasts to friends ( and am not talking about - I knew this person I use to talk to/am talking about friends you played with/loved)"

I actually lost balance at one point, which shouldn’t happen if you’re doing it correctly, and as with the previous few days, my sense of the _NAME_ tien was somewhat lacking. I don’t know what I was doing differently the day I felt the _NAME_ tien so strongly, with this aspect, it is difficult to know what I’m doing wrong, perhaps overthinking.

174381230,"Most people prefer to use person-first language. For example “_NAME_ has schizophrenia” vs “_NAME_ is schizophrenic.” In English, putting the adjective before the subject places a greater emphasis on the adjective than the subject.

Using person first language puts the emphasis back on the person’s individuality. This isn’t an issue with all languages."

I certainly have Dyslexia and Dysgraphia. But, I am not too sure about others. Like what would explain the following symptoms: irregular speech (means sometimes, I am speaking with a different accent; other times it is different). People in various periods have told me my English is very good and other times there is a thick accent. It could be the good and bad periods of the Schizoaffective, too. I would cycle very fast between good and bad periods can’t learn dance steps, and their rhythms, at all can’t learn the forms of gym exercises miss words while writing sentences.

These focus problems can be attributed to the Schizoaffective Disorder when too many people are talking, I go quiet. Sound filtering problem, basically Etc, etc. Somethings change, though. Learning the steps (physically) aside, the Comprehension problems, focus problems, etc, etc are either less or more, depending upon the state of the Schizoaffective.

I care about my father’s job and I care about my brother’s future. If I make one wrong move, or one wrong approach to society, my family’s reputation goes downhill in my mother’s side of the family. My father’s side of the family are jerks and they abandoned my father when he became an orphan. Screw them. If they all know that I’m schizophrenic, my mom will be faced with e
ndless shame. I hate it. I hate myself and I hate my existence. But I really wish I could change my mindset in an instant and understand that I’m full of worth. I tried so hard to convince myself that I’m worth it but it’s so hard to get rid of this horrible mindset. The more I think about it, the more I lean onto suicide. I hope to one day beat the self-_USER_ID_ and fully accept who I am."

176153210,"You didn’t give me enough options to vote on. Even if life is abundant in the universe, the great majority of it will be primitive life. It took the earth how many billions of years for life to evolve from microbes to intelligent beings capable of writing a Shakespearean sonnet? And even if we do find life with a human like capacity to reason, the great majority of that will be stone age hunter/gatherers. The hominids first became human about two-hundred-thousand years ago. Civilization didn’t first appear until about, what, five-thousand years ago? Then, if we do run into beings that are technologically superior to us, they might kill us just because they don’t like us."
176153211,"For y’all who are very confused with the occasional post of me screaming “I hate you” at myself. Here’s a backstory. I was severely abused by teachers and bullied heavily during my late childhood years. That scarred my self-esteem entirely. I was told that I am just a “disgusting child” and I should be punished. In fact, I was punished for nothing and I was often scolded and abused. The students took advantage of this and started abusing me as well. During the first few years of my childhood, my mom wanted to divorce my dad. She didn’t like how my dad was never home and was just studying for something he wanted to obtain. So, she put mostly the anger on me because my brother was so young. She taught me that mistakes are never good and that I’m not trying my best. So I spent few years of my childhood being afraid of her. I know that she was just trying to make me a better person, but I became so afraid of making mistakes to the point of hating myself. She even tried to throw a fork a
t me because I told her to stop laughing at my poetry reading practice thing. I cried and pretended everything was okay. Later in my life, I told my mother that I was scared of her. She cried, I cried, and we all cried. We’re on a very good terms now. So my childhood was ripped out of me because I was abused, bullied, and wasn’t safe at home. Because of this, I was diagnosed with PTSD and I still live a pretty bad PTSD. Either I’m triggered by something I saw or I just have a PTSD episode and start automatically hating myself for everything. I’ve been open about my abuse to a lot of people, but I never told anyone why I hate myself so much (except my counselor who is helping me with PTSD issues). So if you are confused why I continuously lash out at myself, it’s because of PTSD or something triggering me, such as a bad physical pain flare."

I have every single symptom of psychosis on and off all day everyday. I suffer from very bad nightmares every night some tortured while I’m awake and while I’m asleep. I also suffer from my chronic jerks when I sit still. My body will just fly out of the middle of nowhere. I’m scared of my symptoms and me just getting worse. I have tried all atypical antipsychotics with no success and have even gotten worse on them. I suffered from nms from paliperidone shot also known as invega. I swear I suffered brain damage from it as well as I’ve never been the same after receiving those three shots. I also suffered from Two Strokes 1 almost 8 years ago and one a few months back. So needless to say I’m a hot mess. Please keep me in your thoughts and say a prayer. Whether you believe in any sort of spiritual belief not prayer helps. It’s putting good positive energy and

174381289,"Welcome to the forum! I was considered a late bloomer and diagnosed with psychosis at 28 years old. The doctors were quite hesitant in diagnosing me with schizophrenia, but when they started realizing I wasn’t getting better with time despite sobriety well they didn’t have much choice. Like you I have had a string of diagnosis since a young age. I never got narcissistic but I did get defiance disorder which is the teenage equivalent. Personally I think the best one I ever received was complex post traumatic stress disorder. It’s not in the DSM but they are thinking of adding it. When a person undergoes “severe” trauma the symptoms start mimicking other disorders. I have visions and oral communication now but it wasn’t like that at first. I wanted to expend my communicating with “God” “Aliens” “Plants.” I spent a lot of time just sitting there listening, trying to push my mind in that direction. I don’t push it to much now, it comes naturally. There were delusions that came 
with these as well which I did not have much control over. I like having sz because its my way to connect to things that a lot of people don’t know about. I don’t think that everything I hear is true, but it gives me some really cool ideas, theologies to look at. I hope this helps."

I had anhedonia and depression for about 14 months after that with little interest in sex. I started to get back some libido after about 2 years, but nothing like when I was unmedicated. now im on 234mg every 5 weeks and could probably have sex twice a week if I wanted to. sex just isn’t that important to me anymore so I don’t worry about it. most of it is meds, and some of it is getting older, and being less fit. i’ll be 35 in November, I’ve started working out again and feel more like myself. I choose invega because im single and it takes care of most of my hallucinations and gives me some normalcy. once again sex just isn’t that important to me anymore, I never wanted to have sex past the age of 40 anyhow."

Therefore, to evaluate the appropriateness of the schizophrenia consensus criteria, a definition of remission based on the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) was developed and remitter subgroups were compared.239 patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were evaluated 
regarding their remission status after inpatient treatment. Remission in schizophrenia was defined according to the symptom-severity component of the consensus criteria by _PERSON_ et al. and a CGI based definition was calculated using sensitivity and specificity using receiver operating curves (asymptomatic remitter). Both remitter groups (schizophrenia consensus versus asymptomatic remitters) were compared regarding different clinical variables at discharge as well as the likelihood to relapse within a 1-year follow-up period. Both schizophrenia remitter subgroups were compared to remitters in major depression as a reference value.Following the consensus criteria, 63% of the schizophrenia patients were in remission compared to only 18% following the asymptomatic criterion. The schizophrenia consensus remitters were less likely to be concurrent treatment responders (p?"

176153456,"Voices are driving me crazy, lying to me about the end of life, I’m also worried about this election and the demons in my head — Im scared and it feels like the hardest thing ever for me to just sit here or lay in bed … Fighting the urge to drink - can anyone just talk to me to get me out of this rut?"
176153457,"I’m too disabled to work, but when I did I only worked about 15 hours a week in the end. I went off my meds and have never been able to do it again, except for a few volunteer jobs twenty years ago. I was very happy working, stick with it!"

174381335,"Of course, medication is key, however ive been on meds since september, 4 different ones, and am currently on abilify and olanzapine. What can i do to stop obsessively thinking and worrying about my dx and paranoid thoughts (such as wether my family actually hates me or wether me being diagnosed schizophrenic is some sick joke/conspiracy)? What did you do to move onwards?"
176153459,Some of them are wickedly intelligent and manipulative. Others are very wise and benevolent and have really guided me in life. They range in intelligence i would say.

176153461,"Oh yeap, you are probably like me… I take some benzos when I am at my worst, but they make me stoned a bit… I wish I could do it without them… Plus as for you, I still have some fear even on benzos… Do you think a lot too sometimes? I find, that maybe this could be a reason for our worries lol… So the aps are not the best option against anxieties? yeah…"
176153462,Schizophrenia can be very lonely if you start worrying about people closest to you.

176153464,Latuda is a mixed med for me. Could go good or bad. I’m still on Vraylar. I guess I should expect my mind to change hopefully for the better with less caffeine and crap in it. It’s a unknown scary process. I’ve always tried figuring things out and questioning things since 2011 – especially my life and existence like what happened to me and how things work.
176153465,"It might be, but I will honestly say its not worth it for you to fight it. The time an energy invested will at most be paid out by an insurance claim and thats at best. If you do see any money from it, it will be after years and years of effort on behalf of lawyers, who you will have to pay most of the proceeds of the resulting award. I think the best you can do is inform the medical oversight of the doctor you had about the event and see if they can verify if it was a genuine error that training should’ve prevented, and then have them penalize the doctor. I don’t think you should try though, because they’re doing their best and we as advocates for ourselves in altered mental states we aren’t at our best to describe in perfect terms our conditions."
174381340,"Go ahead and make that poll _AT_MENTION_ Personally, negatives are driving me crazy even on a atypical AP(Aripiprazole). But yeah, I prefer the atypicals as well."
176153466,I hope they can figure it out! I think catatonia is not something you can usually recognize in yourself
176153467,I’d be quite upset if guy I was seeing went to my bestfrnd wen we broke up n had a thing. But he does have the right to do that. I’d just be pretty down. I guess it actually depends on why we broke up. If he was a ??????? to me n then my bestfrnd hooked up with him. For example I’d feel sad.
176153468,Take _AT_MENTION_ advice that is your best bet.
176153469,My parents were well and strict. Its a good way but didn’t understand me!
174381349,"All I know is that delusions can be so similar but going psychotis can feel so novel. I like that Dire Straits song…two people think they’re Jesus, one of them must be wrong. We do some seriously weird stuff. I wish I had a penny for every story about embarrassing behavior. But it amazes me that we go through similar things. I read a bit about the history of psychiatry when I was diagnosed. There was this case study by someone pre 20th C who described this 30 year old who went what we would call psychotic. They even _NAME_ a complicated picture of the machine that France, They were English Patients…( _PERSON_ for using that analogy to me!), was using to complicate their thoughts. We are all suffering a similar concern! Surely you can’t be serious? I am and don’t call me _NAME_!"

176153471,"I start to be dizzy on Zyprexa… But its happening to me after two years of take of it … I guess I was just too tight by mental pressure before… I was like a soldier before, but I am more relaxed now, so I feel my Zyprexa sometimes… Yeah, I wonder also if the dizziness goes away with time?.."
176153472,I know we live in a simulation. Time will tell (again) and prove me right. There are a few caveats. Who created it? God or aliens? Is it really a simulation or just isomorphic to one? I believe and want to believe its god. Its the cause of my spirituality and insanity. Both…
176153473,"I drink coffee but I notice that the caffeine kinda makes me irritable. Ritalin made me very angry, adderall made me so messed up I constantly picked at my skin. But dexedrine at a low dose works for some reason."
176153474,"Well, the doctors examined me thoroughly and ruled out leprosy, elephantitus and the plague and diagnosed me with schizophrenia by default."
176153475,Are you by chance a perfectionist?
176153476,What is your diagnosis under your current doc? The one you feel doesn’t fit.
176153477,"I once had a tactile where it felt like someone was, uh, penetrating me. It was really unpleasant. I also once kept thinking there was blood running down my head. And before I started Invega, I would often feel like I was wetting myself, which is kind of unpleasant, because I only felt it when around other people, so I’d have to go use the bathroom all the time just to check I hadn’t peed."
176153478,Do you also see a therapist?

176153486,Hello I’ve been ok. Still taking care of a bunch of animals but I love it
176153487,"When your brain is very focused on breathing, it has less room to think about anxieties. Also, like _AT_MENTION_ said, it activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which sends signals to your entire body that there is no danger and it is time to calm down. When you say it doesn’t help this type of anxiety, I get that. Sometimes, I have the type of anxiety where what will help is talking about my anxieties so I can see what the worst case scenario is and know I am prepared for the possibility of it happening. Sometimes, what I need is to have a distraction from my thoughts, and I am so good at breathing exercises by now that they don’t distract me at all. The 54321 method really helps in that situation, and so does doing a guided meditation video, but those take a bit longer. Do you want me to leave the list of other ways to calm down, or do you not need them right now?"
176153488,It’s probably more like the video game SIMS than anything…but that could trigger people. Including myself…
176153489,"in the early days they were constant, but right now, I rarely hear them… sometimes I can go two whole days without hearing a single voice, but there is always that one voice that talks and reminds me I still hear some voices"

176153493,Should I change to only abilify?
176153494,good job at going for long walk =) funny story too!
176153495,Because it’s just as effective for me as a dose of 200 mg… I’m just as sane on 200 mg as I am on 50 mg… I’m fine on it… It’s just every now and then I get an episode and it really doesnt matter how high the dose is because I still get the same problem. Like in the early years I was on 500 mg and I still heard voices and having delusions just like I am now… I higher dose just isnt that effective for me. I’m pretty much perfectly fine on 50 mg I just get random episodes.
176153496,OH MY GOSH. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! I really appreciate this.
176153497,"Holy heck!! This is really cool, there’s so much energy and texture. o"
176153498,I sometimes have cravings for weed because i feel stable. But then i remember that i have some unusual beliefs related to sz and i dont want them to be hyped. I dont need to see reality “as it really is” at the moment. Im more interested in do i get sick in a year than do i get sick in a day. Im more interested in listening to pop than being popped
174381346,My dose was 100mg injection once per month. They put me on 5mg of abilify. It didn’t work. So now I’m just on abilify and my prolactin is normal.

176153500,"I identify with your predicament, but the question has to be asked: does believing ‘part-time’ and with some degree of insight in your delusions count as truly delusional, or psychotic for that matter? what do your head doctors say?"

176153502,What do you get upto that makes others in the galaxy get hooked on watching you?

176153505,"well i experienced thought broadcasting for a couple years. but my question is this, did thinking others could hear your thoughts make you have worse thoughts? like tourettes of thoughts. it’s like i would try not to think anything inappropriate but then the inappropriate thoughts would pop up and i would keep repeating them in my head. it took a couple years and then i started to relax and decided only the elites could hear my thoughts and they weren’t out to get me, as they couldn’t reveal their little secret. so then it was rarer and rarer that i had inappropriate thoughts, and got comfortable with my own thoughts and didn’t worry about being listened to. but at first i noticed i would try not to think the wrong things and then inevitably would. until i relaxed."

That suffering comes in different forms: some in bad marriages, some in mental illness, some in physical diseases. We just suffer differently. My mom said once that “My children are sick, but other households have bad marriages and mental illness. We all suffer. And things get better.”"

I also deleted Whatsapp recently because i got scared, to the annoyance of everyone i know, and i tried to delete this website - but they didnt listen.

176153530,"When I get certain kinds of anxiety I’ve been taught to try and ‘ground’ myself so that I’m redirecting myself to something that does not freak me out. Like some have already said, focusing on slow deep breaths, focusing on my walking concentrating on the stepping on the ground, the bending of the knees.etc."
176153531,What exactly is happening ?
174381354,"All I have seen is that they think this may be the case because of preclinical findings that it increases the expression of BDNF and GDNF. _NAME_ NEUROSCIENCES, INC _NAME_ Neurosciences Presents Pre-Clinical Data Suggesting a Mechanistic... The Investor Relations website contains information about _NAME_ NEUROSCIENCES, INC 's business for stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts. demonstrate that administration of roluperidone significantly increased BDNF release by astrocytes and hippocampal neurons obtained from the cerebral cortex of newborn rats, as well as the release of GDNF (Glial cell derived neurotrophic factor) in cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, data showed that roluperidone enhanced BDNF gene expression at drug concentrations similar to those observed in humans at tested doses.Based on these results, researchers suggested that the effect of roluperidone on BDNF and GDNF may indicate the potential of this investigational compound for disease modification and improved ne
uroplasticity, in addition to its observed effects on the sigma2 and serotoninergic 5-HT2A neurotransmitter pathways. I hope it works, it would be a major breakthrough."
176153532,"Well, yeah that’s one way of looking at it. It may be them (or both) but we don’t have to help them put their knee on our neck. Figuratively speaking."

Once was an intentional car accident at 200kmh in a snowstorm, once by swallowing a whole tylenol bottle and once by swallowing many pills from a lithium pills bottle. I tried suicide more than that but my parents stopped me. The two first suicide attemps I ended up in the emergency. Police brought me to the hospital as I had shattered glass in my eyes from the car accident and bone fractures. The intoxication attempt I had liver failure and they pumped me with an antidote for tylenol poisoning. I wanted to die that day but my parents forced me to go to the emergency as I was vomitting for an hour. Drs said I would be dead from liver failure if my parents didnt rush me to the emergency."

The voices have been bringing to the surface things on my mind and I think it’s good to face those things. Not necessarily the case for others. For me, I don’t think listening to them makes them worse. Perhaps even the opposite, because I’m not listening and they want my attention. Perhaps!!"

174381361,"Dude, what’s funny to me is that you are blaming a medication for all this stuff that happened, rather than taking responsibility for your own questionable behavior.

174381367,"well my story. i was always a bit disorganized and a little paranoid and had some negative symptoms like lack of motivation in regards to school. i knew i fit some of the criteria for being diagnosed sz but thought it was institutional bs. what got me is i quit my jobs and started to travel and hike, i hiked all around often using the highways as a guide, following them to my destinations. i must have got questioned and thrown in jail 5 different times by the cops for doing this. anyways i naturally got less and less co-operative with cops. wouldn’t answer their questions, wouldn’t identify myself. anyways i was hiking home from the greyhound bus stop one time in ohio it was about a 25 mile hike to get home and before i crossed the state line a cop pulled up behind me. i knew immediately i was going to jail so didn’t co-operate. this time it was in a city, cincinnati. and when i was in jail they asked me a lot questions and made me see i dont know what psychologists, social workers etc. anywa
ys i was in jail a month and next thing i know they call into my cell and inform me they are transferring me to a behavioral hospital where i would be diagnosed schizophrenic by the doctor and given meds. i wasn’t hallucinating at the time, so didn’t really put much into it, i had hallucinated a couple times before but it wasn’t persistent and went away and didn’t cause me any trouble. and that is how i was diagnosed sz. now im sza which is more accurate, im way prone to mania and at times depression. i would say my moods unmedicated are 40% normal, 40% manic, and 20% depressed. i think i was 26 when i was diagnosed. i went off my meds at 27 and started hallucinating like mad for 3 or 4 years. but have been med compliant for the last 4 years and just get calmer night time voices now."

176153595,_AT_MENTION_ I hear what your saying. But at the end of the day we all believe “we are the chosen one” - I certainly did.

I try to apply pure Psychology these days - and ignore those that think a laying on of hands will cure you. Its Bollox - Trust me. And this is coming from a _PERSON_ as a Boy that lived and breathed it for many years. Your not “special” . Your not “chosen”. Its the Sz Talking.

My husband doesn’t eat them except for salad greens, unless we go out to a restaurant, and I always end up throwing some away, so I don’t buy them either. I like to dip cauliflower in salsa! Maybe I’ll splurge and buy the pre-cut cauliflower. I also like raw sugar snap peas. One grilled cheese _NAME_ isn’t going to hurt you. I don’t think I’ll be going over my calories by eating pizza again though! Not only did I gain a pound and hit a plateau, but I got diarrhea. You might find the same thing over time, that you get used to eating clean and then if you go back to old behavior, you get sick.

They are very gross, disturbing and obnoxious thoughts, but I try to stay calm and remind myself they are just intrusive thoughts and are not reflective of who I am as a person and then they pass. It is easy to be ashamed of having those thoughts and want to say that someone else is putting them in your head. It is hard to say I am having those thoughts, but they are not who I am, I can’t control them, and they will pass. You’ll need to practice saying that for it to stick."

Unknown peasants who survived the black plague because of a genetic mutation have passed along those genes and we are now using them to create a vaccine for HIV. People have been making discoveries for thousands of years, and we keep building on them to make the world more suited to our needs. Even us, now, on this website.

I’ve gone up and down the same 2 lbs over and over. Because of this intractable migraine I’m not supposed to do any sort of exercise right now, so it’s 100% reliant on my diet. Which was already pretty decent. If I eat more than 1400 calories a day, I gain weight. If I eat less than 1200, I lose a little. Anywhere in between I stay the same/fluctuate up and down those 2 pounds. It’s frustrating. At the advice of my rheumatologist, I’m trying Whole 30 next month. It’s an elimination diet that will hopefully help me control my headaches/migraine and chronic pain/inflammation. Plus, added bonus, most people lose a little weight while on it. But I have to go a whole month with no weighing or measuring myself. Which is going to be really hard because I don’t want to end up gaining all that weight back."

First, it tends to cause arguments, because for some reason people can’t seem to just respect each other’s different religious beliefs. Second, many folks suffer from religious delusions. It is one of the top three topics of delusion, alongside aliens and government conspiracies. We don’t allow discussions on those topics, either. Third, there are many members here who were subjected to exorcisms by family members who, sadly, did not understand their illness.

176153704,Maybe the clozapine is to take care of the harsher effects of the Abilify. When I was on the Abilify I was a little too antsy. Maybe the clozapine is to lessen those effects. I actually got an increase in physical strength when I was on the Abilify.
176153705,"Thanks for the feedback. TomCat: 1% of the population is ~200,000 people. Each of those people have friends, family, employers and colleagues who are also impacted by their illness. That is likely to be millions of people and a huge proportion of the Australian population. You’re right that when you first get sick the paranoia is overwhelming. Which is why I’m trying to figure out whether someone in a psychosis would just delete the app in fear that it’s spying on them. I think the idea though - is to catch it pre-psychosis. So ideally - before the paranoia becomes overwhelming. _USER_ID_: It’s just an idea at the moment. Prior to developing it we would need to conduct a proper assessment and research. Ie; I don’t know how precise it could be just yet, or whether it would be able to accurately detect sz, psychoses or whether it would give false positives You’re right that sometimes drunk people can talk in a similar way to someone with sz. Just as normal sober people can. No-one is immu
ne from delusion (jumping to conclusions). It happens to every one, as well as on a higher order to groups of people such as populations of countries or the world. We cannot jump to the conclusion that such an app would be too hard to make without the proper upfront research required to assess its viability. In order to influence those who could develop such an app, and to receive funding - I would need to ascertain the likelihood that those afflicted would actually use it. This is what I’m currently trying to do. Thanks again for your respective replies."

176153713,"It’s the same. I didn’t say it was all genetics, but if you think looks can’t be changed then you must have been living under a rock for the past centuries. Personality is highly genetic and changes little during adulthood. Also, I’d much rather be rejected for my looks than for my personality. I’d also much rather be a woman than a man if I had to live my life single. You can have families without men, and women are happier being single than men are. This (the unfair world of dating, that is) isn’t a women’s issue. There’s a reason incel groups today exist for men, and it’s not because men are inherently evil. There are social factors at play here which many would like to ignore."

174381442,"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-00868-5 Neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (Sz) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are chronic mental illnesses, which place costly and painful burdens on patients, their families and society. In recent years, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family member Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and one of its receptors, ErbB4, have received considerable attention due to their regulation of inhibitory local neural circuit mechanisms important for information processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility. Here we examine an emerging body of work indicating that either decreasing NRG1–ErbB4 signaling in fast-spiking parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons or increasing it in vasoactive intestinal peptide positive (VIP+) interneurons could reactivate cortical plasticity, potentially making it a future target for gene therapy in adults with neurodevelopmental disorders. We propose preclinical studies to explore this model in pr
efrontal cortex (PFC), but also review the many challenges in pursuing cell type and brain-region-specific therapeutic approaches for the NRG1 system."

I replied that it can be dangerous as some people can lose their sense of self forever. For me, I dissociated for a few weeks where ‘I’ didn’t exist. It was as if I had died and had no awareness of the present, past or foreseeable future. This could be interpreted as some form of enlightenment as it is an ego death of some form. I said that if dissolving the ego was an aim that it seemed nihilistic because I was no longer alive for all intent and purposes, even though my body and mind existed in some form or other as a separate personality. If ‘I’ no longer exists then for me dissociated I was as good as dead. The universe continued obviously, but I was not aware of it.

176153822,"Hi! Welcome! I think you have to be aware that natural remedies like valerian root or st johns worth can have side effects too, or withdrawals, or interactions with medication. I would always check with your doctor. I think vitamins should preferrably come from good balanced food. Good added vitamins and herbs I suspect are mostly dependent on individual needs and diet. Did you get bloodworks done? Is there any imbalance? Did you check with a herbalist doctor? F.e. I personally use evening primrose oil against pms/pmdd, but i suspect you wouldnt want or need that. And I used saffron in the past on rare occasions when im sad or frightened. It becomes me well, but i wouldnt want to get addicted. Also, it has an ssri-like effect, so i wouldnt combine it with an ssri and dont know whether it interacts with seroquel. I think good diet is the most important (and im a hypocrite because i suck at that). Good luck!"

176153825,_AT_MENTION_ is right. Welcome to our community _AT_MENTION_ ! You are most welcome here!

176153829,At least from the abstract the article seems to be harking back to cognitivist approaches to delusion. Is intensity of conviction a reliable measure of delusion?
176153830,What are you talking about?
176153831,"My very first psychotic episode years ago revolved around being in a car accident that night (the accident never ‘really’ happened, no one experienced it but me). I’ve always held strongly to the idea that I’ve experienced death already, or am STILL experiencing it right this minute. I’m either on my way to the beyond (wherever I was before this life), or am already here maybe? The details get changed around sometimes, but the base of my ‘delusion’ is always that what I see right now (my phone screen, couch, coffee table, even people sometimes) are not reality; THIS is all in my head, to protect me from a violent death, and if I ever get brave enough to remember my death I will become enlightened and reach a higher state of being."
176153832,"I have tried a lot of supplements. I haven’t really been able to lower my dose, but supplementing helps me to achieve a better quality of life while on medication. Certain supplements seem to help against some of the side effects of the AP like drowsiness, lack of concentration, poor sleep, OCD, out of control inner voice, etc. Some of what I take is: fish oil, magnesium, NAC, glycine, lechitin and niacin. Also many supplements seem to help me combat depression naturally, so I don’t need any meds for that. Some I take are vitamin D and raw cocoa."

176153841,Yes I was on that before my pdoc switched me to Valium. I was prescribed 300 mg 4 x daily. It was ok for anxiety but I have panic attacks so I needed something stronger. Gab ape tin is great for restless leg syndrome. The only negative is gabapentin takes a long time before it kicks in. Well at least for me it does.

176153845,What happening in this guy’s brain during that time is like this. Gets a thought if missed some. To get rid of that thought he checks. After checking he again gets and he again checks and this loop continues. He know its false thought but helpless as the urge is so strong.

176153848,My Years of Pain is what gave me a unique insight into other people. Without it i wouldnt have wanted to change. My suffering when undiagnosed is part of who i am now. And i am a better person for it. I have far more empathy with people.
176153849,"Well, are you suffering? Because I used to suffer from solipsism and it was hell. I learned to move on. Found out it was related to severe detachment from reality ie dp/dr and dissociation."

I also think that even if everyone else in the world hated it, it would be worth continuing simply because it makes YOU happy. It doesnt matter if your music is famous or popular. It helps you feel better and thats enough."
176153853,"Something to know about yourself. Maybe it is learned. You can’t work, maybe depressed, so you’ve turned off your desires. But if you can’t get all those desires met then there is nothing wrong with being content. I’m the same way I don’t want anything for a long time. It’s Ok man. Just trying to avoid pain. Nothing wrong with keeping it simple."

Yeah, it pulled me out of my bed for sure, but I dont feel nothing good on my mind from it… I dont understand why it doesnt kill my paranoia and my anxiety? Yeah, I have thinking deficits as well, maybe that’s why… or my fear was way too deep in me… What do you feel on this med, please? Does it relax your brain?"
174381453,"I’m 41, and I’ve had some success. I’ve had schizoaffective disorder since I was 15, which made everything difficult, right up to completely buckling under the stress of med school at 23 years old. When I had to leave med school and come back home to live with my dad, I thought my life was over, and I feared I would never amount to anything. Since then, I’ve been able to work some okay jobs, got a graduate degree, held a teaching job for 10 years, had gf’s, briefly had a wife, lived on my own most of the time since then. There was a nearly 11 year period (2008-2019) that I had my own apartment. Things can get better. I think the more experience you get with the illness, the easier it gets to be, especially after finding a good med combo."

176153864,"Hello- So I’ve been taking Vraylar and Lithium loyally for a little over two years. My dose has remained almost unchanged, at 1.5mg Vraylar and 300mg Lithium. I am aware that this is a low dose. But goodness, I really feel (and have felt for the 2+ years I’ve been taking them), that I have lost several key parts of my “self” while taking them. I am no longer able to do strenuous physical activity due to low energy and weight gain, I am not as enthusiastic about or emotionally responsive to life as I once was, and I’ve started having trouble with minor addictions to stuff like arcades, online shopping, and pornography. Granted, not all of this is like 100% due to the medication, but I believe it is all influenced by it, and I think you’d be hard pressed to muster a compelling case otherwise. Anyways, I just joined this forum and was eager to share my story, as I think too that not so many people have been on Vraylar for a long time (it is so dang expensive, plus it’s relatively new) an
d might be interested in my experiences on it, plus my journey coming off. A bit about coming off- It is about time. I graduated college with a BA in June of 2019, moved to a new state in that month, and have been working a steady internship/job since then. I’ve been waiting for the right time, and I think it’s starting. There’s some other factors, which I can expound upon in this thread, if people are interested. I feel steady. My life is balanced, and I deeply want this to happen. OK- that’s it. Sorry if this is an unusually long intro. Eager to get some feedback. Thanks all."
176153865,_AT_MENTION_ . It’s not proving logical to me. How are you doing? Is there anyway we can help you? I can’t reply to you the way you’d like but your post makes no sense to me. I suspect others may struggle too.

176153889,Got our first essay back…50/50!!! She said excellent. And not everyone did well. A lot of people missed the main points of the assignment. I also got the most abstract part pretty right. And I’m confident on the other 3 essays I did well too because she went over them too and it seemed I got a lot of the key points in there. It’s an advantage being old in school. So much more memories of things compared to these very young adults. And then I got two answers during class that she was impressed with my answer. She said “wow that’s a good one” for both of them. So far so good.

176153892,"yeah im in the states. there is something called ABLE accounts that might allow me to save money and stay on Medicaid and I wouldn’t have to change to a cheaper med. they are fairly new, not all states have them yet though. the only downside of ABLE accounts is that when you die, the state can recoup some of your Medicaid costs, and what’s left is distributed to whoever is to inherit the money. that’s another thing I have to do before I go back to work, is make an appointment with a disability lawyer to learn more about ABLE accounts. but im ready to go back to work, I think I can handle fulltime. I will make a little more money working full time then if I just get a part time job. in a few years I can potentially get substantially more money working full time. actually if I worked in the city I would make 30-40k, but would have 50 hours a week of work and a commute. this way i’ll make about 25k, staying in town, but im ok with that as I re-establish a work history. im also considering goin

176153936,I haven’t eaten McDonald’s or any fast-food or restaurant food in more than 8 months since the pandemic started. I’m too worried about covid and frankly the side benefit is that home-cooked food is healthier and cheaper.
176153937,"During the previous winter, I passed all the time laying on bed, doing nothing, feeling hopeless, listless, dead. I was always saying “I am doomed.meds fix positives not negatives.

176153940,I don’t either. I was speaking from my own experience. I’m sure that some psychoses increase the risk of acting out based on delusions that may sometimes promote aggression. But it can cut both ways; eg. some people are so afraid because of their delusions that they just don’t dare to act aggressively in situations where they otherwise (without psychosis) would. -A.
174381467,"Yup sounds like schizophrenia to me. You’re gonna be OK though. It’s a road of recovery. The meds will make most of that stuff go away in time but it can take a while to find the right med and the right dose plus they take a couple months to take full effect. I have sz too. This forum is helpful. Do you have any questions about it? It’s just a condition it’s by no means the end of life, but it changes things. It’s a hassle in some ways but we all have our struggles."

174381478,"Thanks…I hope it didnt sound i was attacking you… Where you benefitted greatly from the old system and emphasis on meds… I started to get better only after finding my own way. So im tempted to jump on the barricades when someone proposes alternative views, while you might be more sceptical. It is good that you say this though…it is good to remember not everyone needs what i need."
174381483,I don’t know why you are taking it as sensitive issues. We all are suffering from same thing.
176153968,im not pessimistic. Ive just had this illness long enough to know that you need to put the work in to get anywhere. and squirrel knows too the same reason.
176153969,I do not have friends either. But I see often people whom I know when I ride my bicycle.
176153970,It’s just brain chemistry. It is no more nor less. Chemicals alter brain chemistry for similar results. Lsd 25 does this well. You talk a lot and I’ve read your theories but I think your wasting a lot of energy on your own little crusade…I’m not sure if your sz but it’s classical sz behavior.

176153972,It just seemed like I did.
174381481,"Death is permanent. A person with schizophrdenia can get better; many, many do. I was severely ill for the first 2 1/2 years of my illness. I had no relief from agonizing, torturing, intense symptoms. Those first years I saw no hope, I saw no light at the end of the tunnel. I was 20 years old and I had nothing going for me: no friends, no money, no car, no job, no school, no girlfriend, no independence, and very little sanity. We don’t have legalized euthanasia here in California, but if we did I would have looked like a prime canidate for it back then. I spent one year at age 19 going through hell in a group home and after that, 8 months in a psychiatric hospital. I suffered intensely. But after I got out of the hospital and moved into a nice group home in a nice neighborhood, I slowly got better. I got on medication and started to stabilize. Life was still tough but it got a little easier. Now I’m 59 years old. I’m looking back on being almost steadily employed since I was 23. I need three 
more classes for my college degree. I’ve been driving my own cars since 1997. I live in a nice apartment with one roommate. If I would have killed myself legally or legally, I would have missed out on: Flying across the country a couple times for vacation. Having friends that I hung around with and did fun things. Dating a little. Going to too many restaurants, movies and parties to count. Being best man at my dads wedding. Going to my sisters wedding. Going gambling in the state next to mine. Having money. Going water-skiing for the first time. Jet-skiing for the first time. Meeting interesting and nice people through the years. Anyways, this is just a little what I’ve done. I’m not saying you would be able to do all these things but it’s possible for you to do some of them, or other different things. I understand what it’s like not to function, I can understand suffering and feeling hopeless. But things change. But not overnight. I had every reason to give up but then look what I would have missed 
out on. You really can’t tell what the course of your illness will be. It could get much better, it does for a lot of people. There are people working to find out better medication for us all the time. It’s possible that newer medication could come out in 5 years, or 1 year or 6 months. Life with schizophrenia is not hopeless."
176153973,Try to find the light in the darkness
176153974,I don’t fully care what the voices say. Maybe like single digit percent regard for what it is. I forget anyways.
176153975,"I am talking from personal experience. I have less negative symptoms on Abilify than off meds and I went off meds for 2 years. Others on the forum had the same experience as me, one is a mod. _AT_MENTION_"

At least at work when people f*ck with me they don’t play games, it’s clear and obvious."

Not proud of it, but not ashamed of it, either. I’m just me. I will say that it leaves me feeling like a lot of people around me are broken because they can’t process and link information the way I do. You get tired of waiting people for catch up and eventually see what you saw at a glance. Very frustrating."

176153984,"I strongly believe in _NAME_. And as in a dream, the same mind creates humans, circumstances, situations, time, space, birth and death etc. so the mind creates a version of itself: a projection. When desire stops, no more projections occur, and one is liberated. Moreover, I believe I am all beings that existed, exist, and will exist. I had told the ex psychiatrist that I am both Jesus and Pilate,good and bad entities simultaneously. He said “I can bring you here 50 schizophrenics who claim to be Jesus”. Yes, I told him, but no one claims to be Pilate too"

176153998,"If you feel the headache is from high blood pressure, you can try a caffeine pill. That will reduce blood flow to the brain by around 20%. If the headaches are especially bad you should see a neurologist. High blood pressure can be normalized by reducing saturated fat to nil, even if you’re overweight. The mechanism is like this: Saturated fat gets taken up in the muscles, forming “intermyocellular lipids”, and blocks the glucose uptake channels, so blood sugar from carbohydrates ends up staying in the bloodstream, thickening it and raising blood pressure. If those intermyocellular lipids are removed by avoiding saturated fat for a few days, your blood sugar and blood pressure should normalize as well, even if you are eating a high carb diet."
176153999,that sounds scary… i had some stuff like that when i was a kid and the room i was in then always felt weird to me and at night ghosts ran around my bed. I moved to another room and my parents to that room and since then things are good. But i still have bad feelings about that room.

When you go for your next appointment, ask lots of questions. Also the camera thing sounds like paranoia, one time I was outside my pdoc office back in 2014 and just walking by, stopped didn’t go in there and sat a couple blocks away to call the secretary because I thought cameras were watching my every move and being in a building would make it worse even though I wanted to go for an emergency appointment, I told them I wanted to jump off a bridge near there, and then the secretary got frustrated because she said just to come in, I was totally deluded, got near the bridge and an imaginary hand grabbed my foot to stop me, thank god. So it’s good you got help with the meds about the cameras before it got worse, its paranoia"

176154054,"People who don’t tip or who are cheap tippers drive me crazy! I guess it’s because I’ve had a lot of jobs relying on tips. When I go out on a date with someone I don’t mean to do this, but I can’t help but glance to see what kind of tip they left. To me it’s very telling of the kind of man he is and I know that’s wrong, I just can’t help it. If he’s a bad tipper, unless the waiter was god awful I will say I have to go to the bathroom and secretly give the waiter more money and apologize to them. More then likely I wouldn’t go out with them again unless i really liked them and I felt comfortable enough to talk to him about it. Sometimes they don’t know, which I find weird in today’s society and sometimes they are just cheap. One time a guy asked me out on a date and the whole night he bragged about himself. I just tried to ignore it because I knew it was a one and done date for me. He had already taken up two parking places for his car because he didn’t want anyone to hit i
t and he wanted the attention of his car. The restaurant didn’t have many parking spaces and most people have to park on the metered street. It was a very upscale restaurant. Michelin rated and our bill was over $400 and I saw that he left a $5 tip. I had had enough of him by that point and liquid courage from the wine and martinis that I snapped. I said things to him that I shouldn’t have but he was just so awful and after all the bragging he did about himself I just let loose. He said he didn’t tip on alcohol and didn’t feel like he should have to tip if he didn’t want to. Even without the alcohol $5 wouldn’t have been close. I gave the waiter the $80 and left. I did thank him for dinner as I’m not ungrateful but never talked to him again. It’s not like he didn’t have the money and had to save up for the date because he let me know several times he had money."

She remembers things better than I do, and if I have questions she can tell me about the context of it all.

176154092,"Be sure to get plenty of food because you will be irate for about 14 days, anytime you are feeling upset, eat enough to satisfy yourself, and if you can share, also, you may find yourself sobbing, crying, and weeping. After the second week, you’ll slowly feel more at ease with yourself. Keep in mind, you will gain some weight and after about 90 days it is not a bad idea to return to regular nutritious diet. It is recommendable but not required to reduce in indulging with food items after 28 days, or 4 weeks. Most importantly, stay hydrated, preferably with water. What I do to remain calm at times is to keep water in my mouth until I must drink or speak. On occasion, I water a plant or dirt."

A systematic review. _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry , Nov 2019 08 Sexual dysfunctions (SD) in schizophrenia are frequent with strong impact on adherence and quality of life. Current recommendations stipulate to switch to prolactin-sparing antipsychotic in case of SD.To synthetize in a systematic review data on the SD prevalence and the associated risk factors in schizophrenia (SZ).Medline, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and Cochrane were explored, without any year or language restriction.Overall, 89 studies and 25,490 participants were included in the present review. SZ subjects aged 18-70 reported high SD frequency [30%-82%] (men [33%- 85%]; women [25%- 85%]). For SZ men erectile dysfunction [31%-95%] was the most frequent SD vs. loss of libido for women [31%-100%]. The following risk factors were associated with increased 
SD: 1. Illness severity (including psychotic symptomatology, early age at SZ onset, negative symptomatology, and continuous illness course), 2. Depressive symptomatology 3. Antipsychotics (especially first generation antipsychotics, risperidone and antipsychotic polytherapy). Switching to prolactin-sparing antipsychotics has shown effectiveness in some studies (especially aripiprazole). Antidepressants were not found to be associated with SD in SZ subjects.The prevalence of SD is high in SZ subjects. In addition to the current guidelines, the present review suggests that treating depressive symptoms may be a major intervention to improve SD in SZ subjects. Sociodemographic variables, physical illnesses, metabolic syndrome and peripheral inflammation have been poorly or never explored and should be included in future studies."

I missed the gym today and feel bad about that. I used to have “things” saying I’m not aloud to go out. The voices back when I had voices said I’m not aloud to leave the apartment because I’m too ugly to be seen and someone might see me. I had a “force” “energy” forbidding me to go out and do things and I did not feel strong enough to fight it and go out anyway. It’s been a very long time since I felt that “I can’t go out”” I’m not aloud out” but I e felt it again today which is awful. I am a adult with rights. I have a right to go out and how dare this “being” treat me in such a way. They are not my superiors.i have no superiors. I agree with deepak Chopras books about that. Anyway that’s what I hope to do today now that I missed the gym. Hopefully I can get myself out today. I don’t w

176154112,"I’ve never been diagnosed with it but I find it extremely hard to read stuff that I want to read, except this forum, I don’t watch TV or movies or computer games either. Idk man. Is it the meds or is it just me or, is it both."
176154113,"I was a crack addict for four years. I spent a lot of money and time on getting high. I had no choice, the addiction was too strong for me. My life revolved around getting and using drugs. I got into a lot of bad situations and hung around undesirable people who regularly lied and cheated me and I hung out in the worst places. I tried to stop on my own but I could never stay clean for more than a few days. In 1990 at age 29 I started going to AA meetings. I found them interesting and often the people were entertaining and I heard a lot of stories of crazy drug use and stories about guns and violence but they also told hilarious stories of situations they got in. So I started going regularly, and pretty soon I stopped drinking and smoking crack. I found other meetings and eventually I started going to 5 or 6 meetings a week. The best part is that the obsession and compulsion to use was lifted from me. I lost the desire to do drugs. And soon my life blossomed. I got a job. I enrolled in college. I fo
und a friend who didn’t do drugs either. I stopped hanging around people who did drugs and I stopped hanging around places where drugs were being used. I became very social and instead of spending the majority of my time looking for drugs, I started going to movies and record stores and did fun stuff that had nothing to do with drugs. Now it’s 30 years later and I’m still clean. I have no desire to do drugs and I don’t miss them. I’ve had tons of great experiences that I never would have done when I was smoking crack. Yeah, lots of addicts feel the way you do, they feel life will be boring and dull without alcohol or drugs so they don’t seek recovery. It doesn’t have to be that way, there’s a ton of fun stuff to do in life that doesn’t involve drinking or doing drugs and even better, a lot of it is free. I don’t know about you but I can live perfectly fine without the excitement and fun of having someone breaking a bottle over my head and robbing me. I can do without the fun of a stranger 
walking up and beating me with a club because he thought I was someone else. I can live just fine without the fun of being cheated, lied to and conned over drugs. I can handle just fine not being in the company of prostitutes, ex-cons, murderers, wannabe hoods, or people who use me. Quitting is not easy, it takes effort but the rewards of getting clean are tremendous. You have to start somewhere and joining AA, CA or NA is free and it is proven to work for many people. It doesn’t matter how long you have used, what you use or how much you use; you can still recover. I’ve seen it a million times. I’ve sat in meetings with the hardcore drug users who used for 10, 15, 25 years but they still get clean and become productive members of society. AA was a miracle to me, and the meetings aren’t just depressing people sitting around telling depressing stories. Meetings are full of laughter and friendly people, people try to get along and help each other. IDK your story but you have as much of a chance of getti
ng clean as anyone else. They say in AA or CA: “It’s a simple program but not an easy one.” And they’re right, it’s nothing complicated, but you have to listen to what they’re saying because the members talk from experience. I hope some of this makes sense to you. Getting clean is not impossible, it’s not hopeless. I wish you good luck. Good night."

176154121,"One of the problems with diets is that when you’re operating at a calorie deficit your body slows down your metabolism. After an initial period of losing a lot of weight you start getting diminishing returns. Pay attention to what your body wants, but don’t indulge yourself. Watch out for sugar and salt, because they can cause cravings. Protean is good because it helps regulate your blood sugar, but don’t get too much, because excess protean is hard on your kidneys. Also, if you’re operating at a calorie deficit your body will just burn the protean for energy. People often report impressive gains at the beginning of a diet, but that is mostly water, or muscle. A pound of body fat consists of 3,500 calories. To lose ten pounds of fat you would have to have a calorie deficit of 35,000 calories. So if you’re making impressive weight losses at first, it will be mostly water. That’s okay, because the weight will probably stay off. Your body doesn’t want the water back, and water is mostly 
bulk. In sports where weight is a factor a lot of guys lose weight by dehydrating. That didn’t work for me, because if I lost more than about seven or eight pounds by dehydrating I just couldn’t perform on the _NAME_. It was probably because I was consuming so much protean. One time I was watching a story about this guy in ultimate fighting who was dehydrating a LOT of weight to get down to the weight he had to get down to. They were doing all kinds of things I had never seen before. One thing they did was smear this waxy substance all over him to open up his pores. If I was a wrestling coach, I think I would try to discourage excessive dieting, because the real reason wrestlers do that is because they’re ducking tougher competition. They see some stud all muscled up, and they think, “I don’t want no part of him”. I’d try to get them to go ahead and go up against that stallion."

I’ve paid for her STD meds, stuff for her first 3 kids, and plus I’ve had to deal with the fallout of her never once having protected sex. I almost ended up with her kids a few years back, and she had to name all partners she knew the names of she’s been with that could be daddies. The named count is 50+, there’s more she never knew their names. It’s just been a mess. But I get everything handed to me on a silver platter cause I ended up on SSDI, married, and planned kids that we take care of. Yeah my kids wear secondhand clothes except for like new sweatpants cause my boys are tall as hell.

I also have too much emotionality too but mostly positive mood yeah. I don’t know if it is the betaine/TMG or the diazepam but since I took sarcosine years ago which is supposed to act kinda similar to betaine right?, well so sarcosine gave me the same good mood and clear grounded thinking just not the irritability.

I see a lot of phrases like “better results”, “tasks completed and produced high quality work”, but i don’t know your market and what they are managing. It is relative, in your field it works, but for example (being blunt) i can’t hire a schizo-relatedhealthproblem person who dissapears unannounced when i want to count on them dealing with key account, troubleshooting, or actually any unexpected events in strict hours and strict schedule dictated by the profile of enterprise. yes, im refering to _AT_MENTION_ first post and breaks idea all the time. a propos your second post, i wasn’t trying to be rude, i was commenting and asking about the article, _AT_MENTION_ if you felt attacked or anything bad, im sorry for wording, not for my thoughts."

176154321,"hey _AT_MENTION_. Sorry you’re suffering. I experience constant, psychotic symptoms/C-PTSD flashbacks that feel like I am being sadistically abused like I was as a child. I hated the abuse & always fought back, my mother liked it when I fought back as she knew there was nothing I could do to stop her and took pleasure in my protests. Now I’m in my mid-40’s and every sleeping moment is a nightmare that feels like her abuse and most waking moments I am lost in the psychotic symptoms that feel like her abuse where I am fighting back for it to stop. I had no success in therapy. I have not been able to process the childhood abuse memories that plague me & my mind. From what I understand, trauma therapy is supposed to provide a safe environment where you can be vulnerable & re-live the trauma & process it so that it moves from your nightmares/unprocessed memories part of your brain into the place where it gets processed & can be released. Do you feel that your therapy is safe and that your therapis
t is safe? If so your nightmares/waking flashbacks should be decreasing not increasing."

Therapy for OCD does a lot more than make one able to fake that they don’t have it, but it isn’t a cure all and medication helps manage the symptoms, especially before you have learned coping skills in therapy. As far as benzos are concerned, for me they only helped take the edge off of my anxiety when I would try not to act on my compulsions. They didn’t take away my obsessive thoughts or the desire to act on my compulsions. Talk to your pdoc about the best path forward to recovery. They will have a lot more information about what you need. People have different views on meds and therapy, but your pdoc has both the experience and insight into your case to help you make the right decisions for your treatment. Good luck!"

Whilst i think it is good to look at your own responsibilities, it is still the other person abusing you and being the perpetrator, not the other way around. Often there is a lot of manipulation going on in abuse. And there were reasons you developped that “strategy” and found it hard to disconnect, a lot maybe outside your control. Also, as _NAME_ says. I think (whilst knowing how hard it is) it is better to focus attention on better choices in the future than hating yourself for the past.

176154378,Another great story as told by _AT_MENTION_ . Good to hear you are free of cancer.
176154379,"I understand that schizophrenia already makes me susceptible to paranoia and big picture thinking. The mind is like a pattern making machine. We connect patterns to things we do not understand. Logic has helped me overcome some of the worst paranoid delusions I have had, thanks to a patient and understanding father who would help explain both the irrational and beliefs I had rationalized. I have learned terms like: fixed beliefs, magical thinking, etc. and how the consciousness is still not fully understood. So having schizophrenia does not have to verify there is no external presence of God, or that we carry on after our human bodies are gone. I just hope that we are given the chance to further explore the realms of consciousness and creativity. Sometimes the best way to overcome a delusion is not to confirm it. Like for instance with _NAME_ he could easily play on people’s collective fears or thoughts to channel the flow of information. Not saying what he said was right or wrong, but thats the 
issue. Society as a whole could have a collective delusion and we’d know no different. Facts are agreed upon evidence… If I could get rid of my schizophrenia I woudn’t though, because I dont know what it is or what caused it so why take it away before fully understanding those implications. To me schizophrenia is nothing like cancer of the mind. I hope they find a cure for cancer and Im sure they will one day find a cure for schizophrenia that will shed light onto what caused it. Its so difficult to have beliefs and experiences that dont match with mainstream tropes."

176154382,Welcome… You are among friends. Stick with whatever treatments are being done and take the medications on time. That’s key to recovery. All the best.
174381595,at the present there are some theories about the cause of schizophrenia that affirm (also indirectly) that stress in the early adulthood (before the onset of the illness) is not a cause/trigger factor? there are other theories that could be valid that affirm that positive symptoms of schizophrenia appear with the normal maturational process of the brain or other natural neurobiology process (i.e. synaptic pruning for example) of the brain and so that the onset could be not related to psychosocial stress and stressful life events?

I want to do more and try to get back to a normal. Your level of want doesn’t correspond to “can”. But you can make any step. Anything done is worthy of praise.

So I think my brain over-compensates for my belief that I am insignificant. Because my whole life most people only told me I was worth ???? and nothing ever good would happen to me ever. But I lost control a long time ago of my life. At a young age in my pre-teenage years I really just lost control. Not that you ever have any power at those ages anyways, but I was particular

It all depends what the mom needs help with.

176154510,_AT_MENTION_ did you visit there? Mine hardly ever call back to me
176154511,"Honestly several made me worse on them than off them. I have what I equate as a 50% of the time I have had my team ask if I’d be willing to go into psych but i and hubby put our feet down. Never been taken in by police, and the team says since _PERSON_ has full FMLA with work for me, up to 5 days a week and he has the PTO or sick time, they don’t push it. And since my last hospitalization was out on Feb 2008, on my 23 bday, and I got sexually assaulted in a locked unit, I get to make decisions or leave it to hubby. My kids are all older too, so my 16 year old also has a list of loveliness to him, but we will never put him in again either, and he had to go in at 5th grade because another kid called him a total school shooter and my kid decided after almost a year of being called that, he beat the ???? out of the kid. School said we put him into _PERSON_ or cops get involved, but he learned more evil ???? being there than I ever could teach him. He’s high school now, and funny enough, the kid t
hat he fought in 5th grade just in 9th grade got out of juvie for stabbing a kid. And it was 3rd offence. So his psychotic tendency is towards kids that ???? with him and women, which I get, we had to get licensing board involved after his single mom therapist started from 5th grade till Oct 2019 of grooming him, and we won that and she is no longer male patients under 18, because she is just…I’m not as sick as her. My son will not date now because she basically invited him over to her place when he and his girlfriend of 2 years broke up early Oct 2019. He came to my therapy appt with me and told my therapist after he told me, and that one I almost was willing to get a murder charge on once he told me what she had been doing, saying, and constantly touching him uncomfortably for those years. We also took him off his APs before I went off mine. He has same reactions to same meds I do, so he’s stopped therapy as there is no one he trusts except for who I see, and my other son’s but he retired a few mont
hs back. And our only options for healthcare is you get assigned someone at this point, and all they have are women and no family member is allowed to see the same therapist. So we break a rule and if he needs to, he’ll “come with me” to my appt. But my therapist talks to him, i offer to leave room but he says no. But since he and I are identical psychotic, she likes dealing with us. It’s been much easier without the APs, voices never were gone or quiet, hallucinations never went away or lessened. I personally deal watching horror movies and have a serial killer fascination, but those all started before age 12, and he started watching that with me young too. My middle is 15, he watches my movies with me at night since I’m up 7pm-9am. I was an insomniac for years, then worked 3rd shift, and finally SSDI in 2011. _PERSON_ is a 3rd shifter, so during school he takes them to the middle and high schools. I get up at 1pm, shower, leave at 3 to the hell of middle school parking pickup, grab the last one, t
hen go grab the others at the high school. Get home take my pain meds and back to bed till 7. _PERSON_ is just glad I’m sleeping now, no matter the schedule. I’ve taken all sleeping RX on the market, none worked, or I had that damn Ambien side effect where I woke up driving 100 miles from home at 3am. That was 2009. But what’s letting me sleep now is my xanax at 8pm for panic while awake and 3am to get ready for bed. Somedays I get to sleep around 6am. But I also have new pain meds that are helping, I sleep for 4 hours sometimes straight since being on fentanyl patch, so that’s made a difference. The pain doc said if we get my pain at a humane level, my MI issues might lessen too, and he talked with pdoc, so the only thing we have vetoed are the ketamine treatments with the lidocaine. I will in Nov start IV lidocaine infusions, they’ve decided to try every week to see how long each lasts. Pain and psychosis are close sometimes, I was a cutter for awhile, slip sometimes, but I have no scars and never 
needed an er visit to do anything for it. But blood is a calming thing to me, unless it’s coming from my kids or husband, but hence the horror movie/show love."

It may be Bipolar, Sz, OCD, Anxiety, Psychotic depression, etc. _USER_ID_ what it is. But i am concerned about the prognosis. Recently i came across a video of an unknown figure who was explaining about medication for mental illness. He says if mind is not in the brain how can medicine help it. He says to treat mental illness we need psychotherapy, social support, CBT, Talk therapy, etc. And to solve or help mind at unease we need a mind at ease. It seems to be compelling. And to add to that, he recommends a book by a Psychiatrist _NAME_ - Drug-Induced Dementia: A Perfect Crime. After which she was expelled from Psychiatric association. Not sure how many would agree with that person. Also he says most people taking anti-depressants commit suicide."

I can still get it up sometimes however I’m rarely in the mood. We have been together about a year and she is becoming really frustrated and it’s taking a toll on our relationship. She says that when we do have sex, I’m never really in the moment and that it seems like sex is a chore for me. She knows I have schizophrenia and the side effects of the medication (I’m on 100mg of amisulpride, the lowest possible dose). Does anyone have any experience with this problem and/or any advice? Thanks."
176154531,Well it’s a bit different. If your symptoms are stopping you doing what most folks do than that is an issue. It’s usually pretty easy to spot someone on drugs/alcohol or psychosis. Their thoughts and responses are pretty indicative of something untoward going on. There’s a big difference even with things like anxiety and depression. They aren’t in the normal scheme of things and that is the problem.

176154562,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ , I don’t do the wagon thing. Although that’s how I stopped drinking. Allow me to explain: My brother in law joined AA. I don’t really know what his problems were but I guess they were pretty bad. After he joined AA I thought about what life would be like if you never drank again. No more DUIs, no more hangovers… I thought about it for 6 months and decided I was willing to make the life long commitment to abstain from alcohol."

176154574,Howdy there freakonaleash (what I feel like sometimes ) I have just not written for a while as I usually write the same thing but those little things please me reading in others posts so I would like to start writing here again. Thank you for the call out to me feakonaleash.appreciate it. Yesterday I got to have a ultrasound which is great because I did not have to wait. The man was nice . I have a cyst on my endometrium and a thick lining which they later changed their mind about. I had a early menapause and have been bleeding heavily which I shouldn’t be and which indicates something is wrong. The results are nothing to worry about but I might see a gynaecologist. I want to remove my uterus but can’t afford to as they would only remove (free) it if they found cancer. It’s painful surgery but would give me less worry and troubles. I went to the gym and continued activities despite really heavy worry.and I’m proud that I managed to do half a hour of spinning and today is pump. I walked my br
others babies the dogs. And they are safe.unharmed.a big dog jumped the fence and started attacking them.it was pretty scary but I didn’t get scared till after. They are such darlings those dogs but quiet a handful.they pull on the lead.a lot.i want to train them but I can’t remember what I did with my dog and treats don’t work so I just hold on tight when they pull. I love them.short walks with them but at least they get to “smell the newspaper “ and wee etc and just get out for a while. I love my x dogs .they have a good home .

176154586,Green tea reduces weight dramatically but it also causes insomnia.
176154587,"Yah. Glad to have a friend and got carried away. Now you probably won’t do that again, you learned. So even sz has a cap to its behaviours. Oh yeah before psychosis. Gosh… lol"
176154588,"That’s a refreshing and encouraging way of putting things – thank you! It’s hard for me to see much value in my life right now. jealousy is becoming a problem, too, whereas before, I could keep it at bay and rationalize it away. My younger siblings (I’m the oldest) who are old enough to work are all working in demanding fields, dealing with workplace dynamics successfully and not getting all paranoid like I’m prone to doing, and here I am, not able to last even a year at a fast food job since getting sick. My family praises them and I’m just kinda… there. I’m sure I’m seen as a waste of potential. My illness is largely kept a secret, too, so extended family probably think I’m just lazy. In five years, I hope to be living with my boyfriend, possibly even married to him. I’d like to be working full-time but I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that ever again. A part-time job somewhere low-key would suffice, I guess."
176154589,I’m in. Reached my maximum of 110kgs which put my BMI into the obese catagory. I’m down to under 101kgs with mostly exercise and eating a bit smarter. I have been having only 3 meals a day and rare snacking which has helped a lot. My bmi is down to overweight and I’m on the path to my first goal of under 100kgs. It’s a work in progress and it’s a marathon for me anyways.

We don’t know why but it really hurts. She told me today to take ibuprofen around the clock and see if it goes away eventually. I hope it doesn’t last much longer

176154628,"_AT_MENTION_, I have tried to avoid this thread as the concept of “race” has played a large part of my psychosis in the past and to this day I can’t seem to shake the paranoia associated with it, though things are good at the moment, for me at least. I think the thing to remember is that “race” is not linearly ordered, we are all supreme in our own way, and appreciating the supremacy of someone else is nothing to be ashamed of, provided one doesn’t place it within a linear hierarchy. The world is four dimensional at least, so trying to place people within it in a linear hierarchy is a denial of this, perhaps this is why it is so difficult to write about “race” without being racist in some way, since writing is by and large linear, at least English is. Recognising this, I no longer get so angry about one dimensional discussions on “race”, recognising that they will always contain elements of racism, though obviously I condemn incitement to violence or hatred. As I said, the world 
is four dimensional at least even if our language is not."

However, the evidence for its efficacy is mixed, with contradictory results between studies due to lack of consensus about the optimal stimulation parameters.The present study was planned to assess the safety and efficacy of 20-Hz rTMS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Lt-DLPFC) with more robust stimulation parameters for adjunctive treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.Thirty patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] negative subscore ?15) were randomized to receive a 4-week treatment with either re
al-rTMS (n = 15) or sham-rTMS (n = 15). The study outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 5th and 20th rTMS sessions with PANSS, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of illness scale, and rTMS side-effect checklist.There was significantly greater reduction in negative symptoms assessed by SANS score in the real rTMS group, compared with the sham rTMS group. There was no significant difference in the rate of side-effects reported between the two groups. The rTMS treatment was well-tolerated by all the patients, except one seizure episode reported in the active group.The high-frequency rTMS protocol was safe and well-tolerated, provided patients prone to developing seizure were excluded by baseline electroencephalography prior to starting of the treatment. The 20-Hz rTMS over Lt-DLPFC with more robust stimulation parameters (100% motor threshold and 40,000 pulses) might be an effective augmentation strategy for t

The noise from neighbouring apartments that you’re experiencing is likely very real.

Baseline individual symptoms that could predict subsequent relapse were identified, using a _PERSON_ proportional hazards model. Moreover, among those who relapsed during the study (n?=?73), individual symptoms were compared between baseline and biweekly rat
ings 8 to 2 weeks before relapse, using the linear mixed model.A greater score in grandiosity at baseline was significantly associated with subsequent relapse (adjusted HR?=?1.24, p?=?0.006). When the two treatment groups were separately analyzed, more severe grandiosity (adjusted HR?=?1.43, p?=?0.003) and less severe hallucinatory behavior (adjusted HR?=?0.70, p?=?0.013) at baseline were significantly associated with relapse in the oral SGA group, but none was identified in the LAI-R group. Emotional withdrawal was significantly worse 8 and 2 weeks before relapse compared to the baseline (p?=?0.032 and p?=?0.043, respectively).More severe grandiosity and less hallucination may have led to more frequent relapses in patients with schizophrenia receiving oral antipsychotics, which was not a case in those receiving LAI-R. The exploratory analysis indicates an increase in emotional withdrawal before relapse may be a useful marker for earlier interventions to possibly avert relapse."

I have trouble feeling happy now because my body is in bad shape although I still notice a nice weather day, and the sounds of nature.

AVL-3288 is a n?7 positive allosteric modulator (PAM), which is only active in the presence of the endogenous ligand (acetylcholine), and theoretically less likely to cause receptor desensitization. We evaluated the efficacy of AVL-3288 in a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, triple cross-over study in schizophrenia patients. Twenty-four non-smoking, medicated, outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and a repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS) ?62 were randomized. Each subject received 5 days of AVL-3288 (10, 30 mg) and placebo in three treatment weeks. The primary outcome measures were the RBANS total scale score, with auditory P50 evoked potential suppression the key target engagement biomarker. Secondary outcome measures include 
task-based fMRI (RISE task), mismatch negativity, the scale for the assessment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia (SANS) and the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS). Twenty-four subjects were randomized and treated without any clinically significant treatment emergent adverse effects. Baseline RBANS (82 ± 17) and BPRS (41 ± 13) scores were consistent with moderate impairment.

It works for some people. The actuaries count on some of that money never being collected. Private sector pays more but people want cushy jobs.

I am between projects at the moment, so I gave myself a day off and a day to tie up loose ends. Making things as stress free as I can. With your situation, I suggest if your problems are anxiety based or not, you need to get your treatment team on top of this. Make it a priority for your healthcare provider to allow you to keep your job. It’s so important in many ways what you’re trying to do, and they need to be making sure they support you in trying to do this. I really hammered home with mine the importance of working rather than not doing anything, and made them understand that people need extra and different supports doing this. Wish you best of luck. Set backs happen all the time, but try and remember the good days rather than the bad (I know this can be hard, but make the most out of the good days)"

So twice I got stimulants prescibed and abused them both times even though i told myself Id be responsible with it. I am not one of those people who can be responsible with stims. and the zopiclone med I actually took 30 pills the first time I tried without any memory of actually it taking them all. I just woke up the next day with an empty pill bottle beside me.

176155062,"Let’s look at the evidence. People want things like a house, car, and a routine of self interest driven consumption. People lie, cheat, and steal to get money. People often times choose a spouse based on their income level on dating sites. People take on huge loans in the present to make more money in the future. People spend money they don’t have on credit cards; partly, on things they can do without. Being rich in society gets you attention, praise, and honor. People need money to feed their interests which cost money. Every business depends on money for survival. Money is talked about on all forms of media on a daily basis. People become ruthless when they find out there will be cuts at their job or place of business leaving them with less money. When people lose their jobs they often lose friends or someone they’re dating. All the advice on dating sites point to being more materialistic. Religious organizations tell you not to value money but they always need money to survive. You be the

I make about $25 an hour so I am losing my disability but honestly if I had stayed on SSDI and just worked part time at McDonald’s or something like you are considering I would be bringing home more money. My SSDI was kind of fat. I have paid about $150,000 into the system from when I worked before. I have three college degrees and several years of management and leadership experience. But I am paying into another retirement system, still paying into Social Security, am paying into a 401k. I am on probation for a year though and if I make it through the year I get a $15,000 a year raise and that will definitely beat my disability. When (and if) I retire from this job I will have four retirement checks plus a 401k. I had a 401k before but I already cashed it out when I got sick. Had to pay a big penalty to withdraw the cash. I wasn’t able to work before but I 
think I can now. My wife thinks I am going to fail miserably but I think I am ready. SSDI gives you 9 months to test the waters and make as much as you want and I made it through that okay. Sure I had some rough days and had to leave work early a few times because I forgot to take my meds in the morning. But the point of all of this is that you won’t know until you try.

I recently had the feeling of despising someone, it was like an intrusive thought but it was actually a real thought., a pretty powerful thought. I can’t tell the whole story here. Afterwards, when I was at home, I got into the idea that many despised me and that contempt was everywhere, in almost every kind of social interactions. I have the feeling that schizophrenics are generally dispised, so that they are almost considered pests. Could you tell me if you have ever had such ideas? (Actually, I also have obsessional thoughts, and at the time I had OCD). These thoughts were really distressing, as if contempt was everywhere. What do you think ?"
176155140,I would suggest talking to a therapist about your trapped feelings. There are therapy apps online and maybe a physical one near you. I have hopes you do this before the feeling or feelings can intensify. Psychosis with the trapped feelings can limit your freedom.

176155164,I did write a book. Haven’t published it yet. And honestly I need to _USER_ID_ it a good bit before then. I rushed through the end of it. I was waiting for a good ending and going back to work full time was it. I want to work until I can get Social Security again at retirement age but I am still in the extended period of eligibility with Social Security. If I get fired I can go back on SSDI. If I don’t make it I probably won’t try again. I am so tired of failing. Things used to be easy for me and now everything is just so hard.

I hope it does good things for you, you can just keep an eye out for possible bad side effects and contact your pdoc as soon as they happen… just in case.

176155210,"The reason it is seen as more of a problem is because of how few roles exist for black actors as it is. Also because, for many of these roles, the white actors will actually use makeup or special effects to look more like the race of the character. That alone would not be offensive, if it were not for the long history of white actors dressing as other races to mock that race. The most significant example of this is minstrel shows, where white actors would wear blackface and act lazy, drunk, stupid, etc so the white audience could laugh about it With the number of roles available, it is more of an equal opportunity employment thing than just being offended that a white actor got cast instead of a black one. Since fewer roles exist for black actors, or deaf actors, or actors in wheelchairs, etc, it is considered tactless for a white/able-bodied/etc actor to take that role instead of the actor who actually fits the demographic."

176155280,It can be improved by improving sleep at night. Try to go to bed early and make sure getting at least 8 hrs sleep at night. You can compare the selfies taken early morning and at night and notice that early morning face not appear so flat like night time. This suggests sleep deprivation or lack of quality sleep might be one of the possible cause of flat affect. Additionally you can try a supplement called phosphatidylserine soy version. Phosphatidylserine soy free version is less stimulating more sleep inducing but soy version more useful for getting quick relief from flat affect. Both useful as you can take soy version during day time for reducing flat affect and soy free version close to night to improve night time sleep quality.

Judge _NAME_ liked saying, “If it doesn’t sound right then it probably isn’t true.” So mentally ill people are banned for life from having sex? Most mentally ill people I’ve been friends with seemed normal. My friends are people first, and mentally ill people second. Some of them had a lot of sex, some didn’t.

176155367,_AT_MENTION_ Recently I did a different diet and my friend decided to do it with me. So I felt comfortable asking her if she wanted to try the new one with me. We both gained the weight back. I already talked to her about it. She’s not offended. I wouldn’t ask anyone unless they first offered to diet with me.

176155369,"I think you need to think about the effect this wil have on other people. You deserve help and support, but grieving parents are not where you should be looking for that support. They need to focus on their own healing, not yours. I also think listening to them talk about their own dead children will make your delusion stronger, instead of helping you overcome it."

176155375,"I’ve been listening to my conscience more. I like to think abstract. Weird things are happening to me, like I am going through a “dark night of the soul” maybe it’s the weather, spring time and all this social political stuff happening with new governments. I feel fine right now. My mom was worried about me last night and said I seemed manic. So I decided I wouldn’t stay up late and went to bed around 9pm. I slept well, feel relaxed now but of course I woke up again. So higher wisdom has been my theme of the week. I’m always trying to evolve–but have not always cared so much about the meaning of life. Taoism is about letting things go and non-attachment. So maybe my issue is I’m too attached. Too attached to life. If I was normal and I was able to fear death or fear danger then I would have that natural reaction where you can fight/flight. I don’t want to fear/because I can’t handle fear and I don’t like the feeling, I also don’t like anger. So I avoid it—I read one person 
posted on another place they were learning to express anger. I would rather not feel it at all and I don’t care if that makes me less angry. It seems that every time I start going through a shift in my experiences everyone else starts to relate no matter what the situation, online or in person. I think _NAME_ may have been onto something about collective unconscious. But too bad he never found out how to cure schizophrenia. And he was a little off/out there too. I had a dream that the ceilings started caving in. It started my dad was knocking on the door, and I said the roof was leaking and he was annoyed and didn’t believe me. Then I was the only one it happened to. The roof started caving in around me, and I ran outside and then was lifted into the sky with nothing but rain, the dark night, and sadness. Then it started over, this time there were animals outside and they kept trying to get into the house, but no one believed me. Then I came back inside and kept getting back where I started, and my mom as
ked, “Did you have fun?” because maybe she thought being lifted into the sky by the rain would be fun. I wish it was a feeling of release. But it wasn’t. It was like the apocalypse. I was standing in the rain during the night-time recently and let it cleanse me, that was release, feeling the rain and love and spiritual acceptance. This was different/this was angry said vengeful rain and desperate needy wild animals. I may need to move/get into a different env. but I felt the moral was that I dont need to move out that My house is not haunted/it’s me who is haunted. Haunted by trauma and unresolved thoughts."

176155377,Up till 6 weeks ago I had been fairly stable. These last 6 weeks things have gone downhill (coincides with tobacco resumption). But even having gone downhill I was more stable than 10 years ago. Problem is even though I am stable (the metric I am using is no hospital admissions) my concentration is terrible. Can’t watch more than 20 minutes of tv at a time. I am a movie kind of guy and used to derive so much pleasure from this. I feel like I have lost this part of my life. I lead a simple domestic life so movies mean a lot to me. My doc has mentioned ability in the past when I voiced these problems. But this would require a dramatic med change. Is improvement in watching movies worth the risk of a med change? Thanks for your time

176155427,I’m also worried for my Father. He is 86 years old and has a blood disorder.
176155428,"A couple of years ago, in a board & care home, I had to share a tiny room with this 27 year old kid. His story was that he had become homeless for about a year right out of high school and then he joined the army but had to be discharged after 8 months because he once fell asleep while driving a Humvee. He was basically a good guy and we had a lot of laughs and good conversations and I had a job and he didn’t so I always offered him soda because I used to drink tons of it and I would have a two liter bottle almost every night. Lots of times we drove each other crazy though and I think (rarely) that we hated each other occasionally. He suffered from PTSD from a bad childhood and he mentioned after 9 months in the room that he hallucinated bugs or something crawling up the walls sometimes. We both had it tough but he used to drive me crazy with a couple things he did. Really, really crazy. One night he had really pissed me off and he was half asleep in his bed and I just got really mad thinking abo
ut things he had done to me and our beds were only a few feet apart and we had a wooden floor. So I got up and I deliberately stamped on the floor, really hard, making a really loud sound. The poor guy woke up like a shot and panicked. He didn’t know what had happened and he was confused and freaking out and scared. I didn’t know much about PTSD so I didn’t know before I did it that it would affect him so drastically. He freaked out and I left and when I came back later he was asleep. I thought that was the end of it but I went to work in the morning and when I got back that afternoon he didn’t say anything right away but after about ten minutes he brought up the incident. It turns out I had frightened him so bad that he told the staff. So we had to talk about it and I apologized but for awhile after that he was scared of me. In my defense, he drove me crazy too with stuff he learned on the streets while he was homeless. But I stilI felt bad for him because I had never known anyone with PTSD before an
d I didn’t understand how I would affect him. Anyways, the whole incident blew over and pretty soon we were back to laughing and talking. You just never know about people."

176155441,"Decided to try to record the strange sound no.1 with my phone. During playback there’s only static noise, meaning either the microphone was too weak to catch it (I’d hope that’s not the case), or it’s a hallucination, or it’s something “magical” affecting the auditory part of my brain or consciousness. This sound followed my left ear even when I went to the toilet at night, so if it’s something magical it must be invisible and stuck with me, or have a far reaching effect.

Getting drunk meant cutting myself, and I’m trying not to live in that past anymore. I guess I cant avoid it forever, it’s my reality I will probably always struggle with.

176155517,It’s really scandalous . I’m fighting the urge to get really political over this.
176155518,I’ll check it out
176155519,I managed to get four days off work to possibly go to the hospital to get my meds adjusted or I could just go to the out patient clinic and get my meds adjusted there. I don’t know which one to do. I want to up my Loxapine to 100 mg a day instead of 50 mg and see if that helps.
174381886,"Ya, I could definitely learn from you especially in terms of philosophy. Years ago, I was looking for other computer simulators here with schizophrenia. Not sure if you remember or just ‘came about’ lol. It sounds like reinforcing each other delusions on my part, but I feel and remember I was a world builder and created a universe before as part of an experiment and I went back in like infinity/eternity ago and got stuck here around 2011 (so far as I know). My memories are painful and pretty dark a lot of the times. Very negative influences on me. I sometimes believe my past lives aren’t really past lives at all but the same life over and over again like time reversal and flow like reverse entropy and we live in a SIMs or simulation that is constantly being manipulated and edited. My vocab isn’t as shiny as most people but I know my stuff. I often think I’m immortal with no past lives and my body just goes back to it’s original state in time with trauma and memories of stuff that ‘nev
er happened’. That’s the scary part. It’s like being Jesus minus the moral and God part and religion aspect. I thought I was an alien or _PERSON_ (advanced human being) among other things. They talked to me as a kid in a ‘past life’ and told me stuff. It was around high school. Sort of like opening another dimension in the spirit world. Crazy stuff. I thought a Reptilian or archon or _PERSON_ replaced my step-dad and messed with me hardcore in my other lives, but I avoid him out of fear and don’t really trust his personality or intentions even though he is a good man, Christ-like, and a good step-father and provider. I think we care about each other. (he has no memory or knowledge of this). He’s getting senile a bit. Some of this stuff spans infinite realities and is related to my past of trying to reach enlightenment. I was forced to believe in God by aliens (former atheist) and to follow Christianity. It gives me a conscience and a foundation for morality in my insanity I think. I know you don
’t believe in conspiracy theories and don’t like them, but I find that odd a bit and weird given your belief system in Gnosticism. You can build simulations and it’s totally possible. In college, probably in this lifetime, I went insane by encountering God (the Christian one – I was an atheist at the time) and was told I lived in the Matrix and that I’m stuck here forever. Makes sense as a form of punishment and a connection to my simulation career. So maybe God and Satan are punishing me. Nobody else remembers except me and I appear and am schizophrenic despite not really hallucinating things. Even got abducted by tall greys asking me how I escaped, how did I do it, how do they leave, etc. It’s weird because different aliens can do it too and escape and go between worlds or simulations. They told me a lot of stuff but it took aeons or generations or iterations (millions or more) to find out the truths of things. It’s sort of like I had bad karma and now I have good karma and people or aliens we
re protecting me and helped me out a bit. When bad stuff happens to people like me over and over again, good things start happening. I always assume we are being watched by the higher ups running the computer. I don’t know. I have a lot of knowledge I haven’t shared I think yet. The way they are punishing me is through transferring my consciousness back in time and resetting me and making me live on horrible, evil timelines. It seemed to have stopped and gotten better now and I’m still scarred and remember the pain and scars. I’m always disabled and schizophrenic. My mind gets totally wiped too except for ‘leakage’ which I assume is _NAME_ and quantum phenomena and mind uploading, etc. It all is nonsense. People have assumed I’m crazy and that I’m making crap up I think. I have no proof or evidence of course. I’ve been perpetually treatment resistant schizophrenic and being ‘reset’ or ‘rebooted’ back in time with the same illness for eternity and millions or thousands of times at lea
st. It sometimes is so bad from my perspective it feels like trillions of times or more like eternity. My biggest fear is being reset and going back to 2012 in time again (death); not making money; being homeless; not remember and re-experiencing my childhood like everyone else here; and that my next few lives will be the same as this with schizophrenia. It sucks balls."

174381898,"How long can you go before the positive symptoms become unmanageable? About the meds supposedly stopping to work overtime, I have never had this problem, honestly. The “studies” that say that you will relapse harder than before with in a year or two do exist, but I honestly doubt they are correct. Ever time I have had to go to the hospital(and it’s been like 24 times in the past 7 years), I feel the same amount of medicine work the same way. When I’m outside the hospital, I’m never allowed to enjoy a life without negative symptoms for more than 15 days in row without some guy telling me that I have to go back. This is even despite have a clear and concise conversation with them. I never say that I have suicidal or homicidal thoughts. This is why I can’t wait until I live in a house again. No one to annoy me if I accidently do something that draws some guys attention."
176155526,"Di or “deo” means two in Greek. Thus a dimension is really binary, from pre-eternity to eternity, it can be linearly ordered. Two dimensions, or the cross, can only be partially ordered, as a tree. Are three dimensions even more complex(?), like a forest maybe(?). The ancients did not classify 0 and 1 as numbers. Thus only a dimension, or binary space, can be linearly ordered. I think all numbers (in the ancient sense) of binary spaces are partially ordered. On the other hand I wonder if this might not be something that only follows from language and is not true in higher mathematics. Is there a physical definition of truth? I am talking about architecture. Is truth an aesthetic? What sort of building should we build? What sort of life forms? And what happens beyond three?"

It does not stimulate neuronal release of dopamine and norepinephrine. Dasotraline is currently being investigated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder (BED). Dasotraline’s pharmacokinetic profile, characterized by an extended half-life, supports its potential for sustained control of moderate-to-severe BED symptoms. The company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for BED is under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sunovion is evaluating other potential indic

176155591,"I took 12 aps in ten years. They are 13 on the market here… none of them didnt take away my fear from the people… some aps even worsened it. And one pdoc was honest with me and told me, that they gave me way too many meds, which probably smashed me even more… i am done with the aps i think… i keep the zyprexa, which helps me eat and sleep and be out of my bed. But i carry my fear still… as I said, I have thinking deficits as well, while the fear probably loves this… and maybe the aps cant make me smarter?.. no good thinking, a good terrain for the fear, idk… One other pdoc told me also, that at our worst, we dont even feel our aps. I believe that I think… maybe I was bad for years, way too bad even for a strong ap. Maybe the zyprexa will help me more once I become to progress a bit too, idk… For the others, what do you feel on zyprexa?"

176155593,Similar for me as well but “I think” people hearing our thoughts is just a part of entering the spiritual world? Like with our hearts… I’m pretty sure this is the reason for thought broadcasting but nobody tells the person who enters since it’s just a stage or something? Anyway I had an experience with this and for sure think it’s real not a delusion that requires meds or something. Also alot of people go through this but get treated like it’s a joke when people are ACTUALLY reacting to thoughts like it’s normal or like they have to hear them.

174381917,"I have 3 mg Paliperidone PRN. Haven’t needed it in the past few days. At my worst, I was on 12 mg Paliperidone. Figuring out the acidity theory of schizophrenia allowed me to reduce my meds carefully, with a doc’s help. Basically involves replenishing the alkaline buffer and drinking ample amounts of alkaline water, to tilt the body’s pH towards the upper level of the healthy range (it’s a narrow range between 7.3 and 7.45), so that the body is in a mode that facilitates healing. My chronic headache is almost resolved now, and my symptoms are minimal and easy to ignore, but I’m interested in a 100% stoppage of them. It’ll come over time, the body heals slowly."
174381915,Talk to your doc. The normal treatment like _AT_MENTION_ said is they’ll add a small amount of abilify to the mix. I’m on abilify only and so don’t have that issue. But the sooner you talk to your doctor the better. Ask them about adding a small dose of abilify.

176155642,So I usually work 5 hours a day however as my manager asked due to workload I decided to do 6 hours. Before it was 5 hours I asked if I could leave but my manager wasn’t there. The senior support admin said I’m trying to find out when my colleague leaves so I can leave with her… probably joking who knows. I wanted to leave cos I can’t cope with more than 5 hours work. I ended up crying at my desk and the lady next to me saying I don’t look ok. I had to explain I’m fine but I sometimes get like this and it will go away in a few minutes and I’ll be fine. Explaining I had bipolar. Which is why I struggle.

176155648,"I think its immoral to not care about the suffering currently in the system of farming and factory farming, but I don’t know how to effectively make change. Animals suffering is real and should be a concern any normal person should have. That said we need to eat and right now there is no scientific way to do that without some living organism being killed. You can face reality with compassion and understanding and try to understand it as it is, and then accept the imperfect nature of the situation we find ourselves in. Nothing wrong with that. Personally I support a movement into research for lab grown meat and am interested in trying it. If we can harvest meat more efficiently with similar taste and texture where we’re not grossed out by the product then we have eliminated a large part of the problem. We’re not far from this being a viable product so I’ll look forward to it when it comes."

176155653,I found a tattoo artist that covers self harm scars. She has depression and she started tattoing flowers as a symbol of healing. She tattoos beautiful flowers on people’s scars so that they can hide self harm scars. I was thinking of doing this for a while (I have self-harm scars on my forearm that’s slightly visible and has been irritating me and reminding me of depression) and I asked my mom if it’s okay to do so. She agreed but she was worried about future surgeries. Should I do this? And what kind of flower should I tattoo on my scars? I thought my mom was going to tell me no but she thinks this is a great idea. Any suggestion is welcome.

I think too much of our society makes marriage such a standard for receiving others approval as being ‘accomplished’ (or whatever the word is?) that people have more reason to stay in incompatible relationships. And of course the pain of having to accept something was a mistake and face potential loneliness is another factor people stay together. I hear you about people trying to tell you to get out of the past and I hate when someone tells me that. Like… I get fired up pretty bad. I would argue people who want to use that phrase probably were traumatized by something so the spreading of such an idea is enticing to the ego. I wish I could let go of the past, but the fact is, it has its hold on us and who we become. It’s not that easy as slipping off your shoes or something…"

176155665,"My dad didn’t scream, that wasn’t his style with us kids. Never laid a hand on us but we did get spanked with a belt if we really screwed up. He told me that he walked on eggshells around me when I was growing up. My sister later told me that he told her the same thing about her. I didn’t really fully understand until he divorced my mom and moved into my step-moms house. Then, I realized he had been holding back while I was growing up and now he could be himself and act like his true self. Now, I saw him interact with friends he had known for 50 years. And the pieces of the puzzle now made sense. He had a rough and tumble upbringing, he was in a lot of fights in his life just like his friends and they were smoking and drinking and going to the worst bars and frequented the numerous ""cathouses* (as he called them) from a young age in the 1950’s. He could cuss, fight, argue, drink and chase women with the best of them. So yeah, I was a shy kid and naive so yeah, he held back. Not to say, I d
idn’t do a ton of cool things growing up, but yeah, he was just cooler and more worldly than me. He was nice guy though, and very intelligent, he could hold his own in most situations whether it was discussing politics, religion, world events or a myriad of other topics. Of course I miss him, I got to know a lot about his life because we used to talk a lot throughout my disease. He was always there for me and I talked to him once a week until I was in my forties. I had got a pretty good recovery at that point and I would help him with his problems too! (Occasionally)."

176155692,"For a long time I held onto a lot of anger at the injustice of everything. Then my therapist asked me if the reason I have so much trouble letting go was because my anger was the only evidence I had that the abuse actually happened. I realized she was right. My abuser never got in any trouble. When I came forward, nobody believed me and everyone told me to stop making up lies. In my head, the only way I could prove to them I wasn’t lying was to show them how angry I was,and how broken I acted. Once I realized they would never believe ne, no matter how I acted, I was able to stop and evaluate whether holding onto the anger actually served any benefit to me. I decided it did not, and that I would rather devote that energy to helping other people who were in similar situations. Another thing I realized was that by viewing my abuser as a monster, I was unintentionally reinforcing my own belief that I was also a monster, for being abused. It is very common for survivors of sexual abuse to feel subhuma
n, and that was how I felt. I spent a lot of time changing my view to see him as a deeply flawed and dangerous person who consistently makes harmful choices, rather than some unknowable monster. This helped me to view myself as human again, and helped me see myself as someone who COULD recover."

176155697,"I’m looking for the word which means a lot of people watch something on TV. Voices say that if I die live on TV, it would bring huge ratings"
176155698,"I’m peculiar too that’s why I liked your post. I hope you’ll stay on, additionally"
176155699,For some reason it is calming for me _AT_MENTION_
176155700,Next to nobody likes invega sustenna. I was left on it for years until I got a new pdoc. She had many people complaining they didn’t feel well on it. So she put me on latuda. If you are a person who needs to be on an injection. There are people who seem to prefer the ablify injection.
176155701,What about the wealthy part. Do you think it’s bad I did not move away?
174381939,I believe so too. My brother disagrees. He said something like _NAME_ would pay millions to cure his baldness if there really was a hidden cure. I guess my brother heard it on the radio or something? I’m not sure. I think it’s all ???????? anyways. I don’t believe half of what I hear anymore. I still think they got the schizophrenia cure.
176155702,"Also, the best way to work through these thoughts is therapy. I dont know of any medicine that will get rid of homicidal ideation."
176155703,"Does anyone else have this happen? I would have never thought of a particular word or sentence, one of my voices says it, and then, right after that, I read the same word or sentence that the voice just said. Whenever this happens, I have not been looking at the word or sentence before the voice says it. This kind of thing happens to me many times a day, and I find it terrifying."
176155704,That sucks that Latuda gave you side effects. Hopefully your new medication does not; I don’t think everyone develops the prolactin problems. I wish you good luck in your search for the ‘perfect’ AP.
174381940,I picked up something on the floor and felt pain in my skull. Like inflammation
174381942,"LS! I hope this is helpful: sciencenorway.no – 7 Jun 19 Why do schizophrenia patients die earlier than other people? The average life expectancy of Norwegians with schizophrenic disorders is 62 years. If you also have a drug problem, it goes down to 47 years. “It’s difficult to understand why this isn’t prioritized by the health services,” says a veteran..."
174381941,That sounds hard. My nurse would say not to be hard on yourself. Good for you for getting to the gym even though you have trouble getting out of bed.
176155705,Lately I feel like everyone I know secretly hates me. I try so hard to be a good friend and yet i feel like it’s not enough I feel like they all just humor my presence and don’t actually like me at all. Lately all my interactions feel forced and awkward and idk how to fix it. I’m waiting for everyone to try to get rid of me or stop pretending to care. I feel like they can all tell there’s something wrong with me and they hate it. Idk what to do.
176155706,"Dude I remember this, used to have it on repeat haha. I can relate to the lyrics so hard and you did an amazing job producing this. Cheers man!"
176155707,Yeah. Caffeine can have that affect on people. Maybe try less caffeine? Like a cup of tea instead of a cup of coffee?
176155708,this section use to be call delusions/hallucinations a beliefs on the old forum
174381946,You get sz regardless of the weed. Weed will lead you down the rabbit hole earlier than intended but for most of us we’d get there. Then there’s self medication. Even if it’s not helping if you’ve had some relief it’s something you’ll do the the detriment of yourself. It’s not a debate. Weed is bad for most sz. A small minority can use it and get away with it. Most of us it’s off limits!
176155709,I’m happiest when I’m happy.
176155710,Great stuff ! You’re really talented ! I used to be into photography when I was younger.
174381943,"I have schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and I work. I have teaching jobs, two of them though I am currently working only one of them, four days per week, and I work two midnight shifts per week at a gas station. I never have had the option not to work, so it’s something I have thrown myself into doing, like it or not."
176155711,"It takes time to build up enough coping skills to face your triggers. Coworkers are a real trigger for you. Unless you can work somewhere with no coworkers, you’ll need to learn how to handle that trigger before you will have long term success."
176155712,"Yeah, compare their service plans and formularies. See about your specialists, hell, see if your current doctors recommend any specific health system/clinic. I knew my limits when we moved back here to Janesville, either Mercy or _NAME_. _PERSON_ is in town, _NAME_ is _NAME_ and that means they serve more people than _PERSON_. But both are over booked, so my therapist is going into their big meeting March 1st to try and get an exemption for mynoldest to go to a therapist she knows at Crossroads. A teen young adult center, and if he can get in the insurance would pay for it if they contracted him out to them. So I have someone on our side. Neither system can keep people in behavior management, so it’s long lists, denials, or you pay cash for help no sliding fee."

176155719,Welcome to the forum hope you enjoy posting here
176155720,I think its sz that did this. I sometimes feel like that.
174381948,"I seem to get flagged here by a group of haters here especially when talking about my ‘delusions’. My last post had 3 likes. But people can post controversial and offensive things like that one thread up right now and no one bats an eye. I think it’s the Liberal toxicity on this forum. I’m outnumbered for sure. Some people that use this site are outright crazy and socialist/communist and have a lot of hate. It’s just the times. I see it in the news and in politics. People don’t have common sense here despite having schizophrenia. It’s not an excuse or cool. I don’t want this forum being shut down because of a couple of idiots/trolls or people who have no lack of restraint. I know it’s not related. But I was abducted in college and I don’t even know why and it’s completely censored here and everywhere I go. I’ve been watching GAIA TV and learned about weird ??????? magic (wfm) and ???? and the cabal and aliens and how they did this to me, but even if they told me the truth, I 
still wouldn’t understand why or agree to it. This is not the forum, unless you want to talk about stupid stuff like “what I googled” or “I hate capitalists” now."

176155723,Yes the interviewer called me at my new job that I took when I was refused. But do you think I forgot her name?!? I’ll never forget her all smiles and I had so much experience. Her loss I had a twenty year career from next interview so I am so glad. The lob I had left was out of business in a year also.

174381950,"Traditionally, “borderline” was used to refer to a condition of borderline psychosis. That is, not quite psychotic but not quite normal. So, if you have schizophrenia (a psychotic disorder), then you would not be considered “borderline” any more. Nowadays, “borderline” is typically used to refer to borderline personality disorder (BPD). I don’t see any reason why you could not have both BPD and schizophrenia. -_NAME_."
176155734,"This makes me think of a time when we were at the gym and my brothers were young at the time and they were playing basketball with their shirts off and my daughter who was 4 years old asked me if she could take her shirt off I wanted to be the right kind of mother, so I said yes, and she did."

176155760,"Would you say that having thoughts that you know you don’t mean counts as intrusive thoughts, disorganized thinking, or thought insertion (even if you don’t really believe someone’s putting them in your head)? It’s kind of ridiculous in my case. For example, even though I live independently in a bachelor apartment, sometimes my mind will still go “you live with your parents”. I obviously know I don’t mean that when it’s in my head. It’s frustrating, it makes my rest time less beneficial, I think. But at least it tends to only happen when I’m not focused on anything, and I can function in spite of it. Anyway, what do you think?"

176155781,"No I haven’t tried that. I texted him once but got no reply. With the control delusions, the voice told me that it was giving me urges to hit my mother and I would get the urge. I also had spells of intense paranoia and the voice would tell me that it was them. They also had a curse called the ‘insanity’ curse which when they used I would become really panicky and generally unstable. What else? They also proved it by making me think of certain things whatever they wanted usually but I would recognize the thought as not my own and that’s how I got out of that one. My voice also told me that it could slowly drug me and proved it by making me calm right down one time I was really nervous. I think it could be possible to die by heart attack if you were prone to them."

176155790,I live in the UK but found some blackout curtains on eBay. Thanks for the suggestion. I won’t look mad doing that!
174381967,It’s when the court listens to the family that the person can’t make their own decisions and then they become their guardian and make all their decisions for them. It’s scary because judges listen to others over the person in question if they have something like schizophrenia or head injury or something more reasonable like mental retardation.
176155791,_AT_MENTION_ what do you mean ? Because I’m the one that snores and quite loudly we might even have to think about separate rooms

176155806,"I woke up with the same ol’ same ol’ attitude toward my life. That is that I don’t really have a good reason for living. But the sun is shining in the window and it doesn’t feel good to be down. With a little effort I can pull my mental muscle around and say if I’ve got nothing to live for, it is time to look about me and find something. And sure enough, there is something.

176155810,Well id say the psych clinics ive been to could use improvement in many ways. Typically you are often shoveled through and just given some med change.
176155811,Geodon also makes you tired at first but eventually gives you insomnia. You will also need sleeping pills.

176155818,_AT_MENTION_ nice. What do you do at the food bank? Is it pickups or the packaging them up? Or something else maybe…
176155819,No need for more than that!!!
174381971,"Well, I think I have to respond to all of this, since I’m tired of people convincing others that “you must have schizophrenia if doctors say so”. First of all let’s consider this: psychiatrist are only people, like every other person and they can make mistakes, everyone does them. The privilege of writing prescriptions doesn’t make them gods. Telling someone that he or she “sounds too paranoid” only because the person explains that the psychiatrist didn’t like its personality is just hilarious and puts the person who blames in a really poor position. You know what’s paranoid? Paranoid is when someone accuses other person of being paranoid, because he thinks that everyone has to be paranoid only because the post was written on a forum dedicated for schizophrenia. It pisses people off. You wrote about something on a “schizophrenia forum”? You’re paranoid and delusional! You wrote about your symptoms on a forum about depression? You have a major depression, ask your doc for the 
highest dose of clomipramine. Or no, you know what? Let’s do a california rocket fuel and put you on venlafaxine mixed with mirtazapine! You wrote on a sports forum about your foot pain? Buy these shoes for only 300$ dollars, your Asics boots are just rubbish and they cause your foot to have plantar fasciitis. But yeah, you can still try to convince people that it’s better off if they suffer on antipsychotics. It doesn’t matter it makes them suicidal, takes away joy and life, makes people so anxious they can’t even go out to buy food. You don’t think something’s not right when stuff like this happens? Well, let’s even say she has a schizophrenia. Do you still think it’s a good idea to suffer other than be happy even with having episodes or whatever you call it? If the drug doesn’t work properly, then it’s a poison for the person that takes it. I’m not trying to say Abilify Maintena is bad for everyone. But it’s bad for some people and it’s a normal thing that they want to get rid of 
it and truly live instead of staying home 24/7, trying to watch TV and understanding maybe half of what people are saying to you. Putting people on long-lasting injections without testing how they react to pills, is inhumane and should be punished."
176155820,Thanks for chatting.
176155821,"I’m very forgetful, can I ask which meds are you on now?"

174381978,"I used to take 10mg and still had positive symptoms. Then i tried 15mg and i slept whole day on it. I’m stable on clozapine now. I tried again adding abilify to clozapine, this time it actually worsened my positive symptoms and made me feel like crying. Abilify is first line treatment for schizophrenia/psychosis cuz of its side effects profile, no major weight gain, no major EPS, no hyper prolactin, no prolonged qtc, no major sedation. But when it comes to efficacy to treat positive symptoms, its actuallly mediocre. More effective medications include clozapine, amisulpride or risperidone but they come with a cost.

Phone interviews, $75 participant compensation. See details below. Have you or a family member been discharged from an early psychosis program? Are you interested in sharing your experiences following discharge with researchers? WHO: Any former early intervention in psychosis/coordinated specialty care (EIP/CSC) client who has been discharged at least 4 months prior to a scheduled interview or family members of a discharged client is eligible. Participants must also be 18 or older. WHY: To date, very little is known about client and family experiences following discharge from specialized first episode psychosis/early intervention programs or how to best support them. This study aims to better understand what happens after discharge from EIP/CSC, including in the areas of school or work 
involvement and access to/use of other mental health services. WHAT: If interested, you would be asked to participate in an approximately 1.5 hour long oral interview by phone. COMPENSATION: Participants will receive $75 for their time, sent in the form of a Visa or Mastercard gift card following your interview.

I could also tell when someone was trying to take the _PERSON_ out of me so that put me always on guard. Also I was very worried being spied on as I liked my own personal space. People used to take the micky out of me for that also Also one of my family members was a cronic weed smoker and as a kid I always used to breath it in since they smoked in the house.

176155871,Well usually when someone thinks they good off meds I’ll say do your research but you seem so confident into what you are thinking that I think it’s better for f without them. That is why doctors always ask do you feel better or worse with your meds. I had the same idea.

176155986,"One thing I can say after five years here: the people with jobs complain less of depression/motivation issues than those without. I’m sure part of that is because people with less motivation issues have an easier time maintaining jobs. But I’m also sure part of it is because having nothing to do all day wears on the soul, and makes it hard to internalize feeling like you matter to society. You obviously matter to society either way, but it’s hard to feel important without being able to point at something and say “I did that.”"

176155992,"_AT_MENTION_ is right. Don’t leave things until the last minute! Plan ahead, get organized, make a list of what needs to be done if that helps. Moving is one of life’s big stressors for most people, it ain’t easy and you don’t want to have moving day come and you still don’t have enough boxes or you haven’t cancelled the TV service yet, or had the power turned on in your new place, or you haven’t got the key to the new place yet or you haven’t got the TV service in the new place or you are in your new place the first night and there’s no light bulbs or toilet paper or food. Get organized and plan ahead. And if someone’s helping you with the move make it clear exactly what time you need them and where you need them and what you need them for. Reserve the moving truck as far ahead as you can and leave time to pick it up and get enough gas in it. And when you’re doing everything just plan that you will take time out for lunch or just to sit and rest occasionally. I don’t want t
o give you even more stress but most of this stuff is common when someone is moving."

People with autism and add also have a higher chance of responding more sensitively to all sorts of other things… meds, diet, hormones, etc…which can cause psychosis too. I seem to regularly have premenstrual psychosis, which also i said to be connected to autism and ADD (as well as ptsd). I have also noted im mislabelling peoples intentions…sometimes horrible people hurt you with a kind ‘front’ and sometimes kind people do something hurtful. Being vulnerable to “predatorial people” plus not understanding made me paranoid too…trusting nobody anymore. No idea if any of these is true for you, but perhaps one of these “fits”."

174382018,"Couple of interesting take-aways: An important distinction, therefore, is that while NMDARs may be hypofunctional in schizophrenia, glutamate release and signaling through non-NMDAR subtypes appears excessive. Thus, opportunities for the development of drugs targeting the glutamatergic system include both compounds that increase NMDAR activation as well as compounds that decrease glutamate release. Elevations in striatal dopamine release in schizophrenia may be driven by glutamatergic abnormalities in the frontal cortex and hippocampus Healthy cortical function relies on the balance in coordinated activity of excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and inhibitory _USER_ID_ interneurons. These are tight and complex inter-relationships and it is unknown which abnormalities in glutamatergic or _USER_ID_ processes may be primary, secondary, or compensatory For example, in a rat developmental model, administration of a glutamate modulating compound (a metabotropic glutamate-5 receptor [mGluR5] positi
ve allosteric modulator [PAM]) reversed adult-onset deficits when administered during adolescence and prevented the emergence of cognitive impairment (_NAME_, 2013). A more recent study also showed that juvenile administration of an mGluR2/3 agonist prevented the learning and memory deficits and restored the dendritic spine loss that are observed in MAM-treated rats in adulthood (_PERSON_, 2018). I haven’t been able to finish the article yet."

174382020,Negative and cognitive symptoms reduce the effect of PTSD as flat and blunted affect makes it hard to feel emotions even though you have the memory.

174382030,"This is a new symptom. Im not diagnosed with schizophrenia, even tho I had transient psychotic episodes that put me in the hospital. I have BPD only. I’m starting to hear voices inside my head recently (a few months ago). I remember last year there was a period, before my hospitalization, where I started to hear thoughts in my head, they were voices with diferent personalities. Males, females…But after months they went away. Now I hear voices like they are thoughts. They come from my mind but I don’t think them, they appear automatically. I call them voices even tho they are not auditory. The weird thing, they appear only when I’m with others, in social situations, it’s rare when I’m by myself. I don’t know why. So when I’m with others, I start hearing full sentences, that make sense. For example, I was getting a massage yesterday. When I entered the room I suddenly heard voices. These voices mimicked the lady that was massaging me. For 50 mins they didnt shut up. They say things li
ke “how are you? Im fine. There is a bad weather today. Whats’ your name? My name is ” etc so neutral sentences. In rare situations they are negative, like “kill yourself, kill others, kill” but very rarely. Tomorrow I’m going to see my psychiatrist finally after months. I’m afraid of telling him this. I’m afraid he’ll say I have schizophrenia. I dont know how to start this conversation. I dont know why the voices appear when I’m with others only. I’m starting to isolate myself so I dont have these voices all the time. Because by myself I rarely have them. They make me feel anxious, and very distracted."

176156082,I think it is $270 USD but you can apply for financial aid.
176156083,It seems fixed now.
176156084,One side is blocked.
176156085,Good to see you’ve changed your mind. You are much loved.
176156086,"Well, I dunno. Not having any delusions or hallucinations I suppose. It works for me in that sense. I haven’t had any delusions for years now. It’s not strong enough for some people though…"
176156087,I’m so sorry I just hopes it does gets better for you. May try to ask your doctor for a change in medication?
176156088,"For my physical illness, I go to the hospital every three months. It’s a bit scary because I’m afraid that my doctor will be like “uh you progressed further into the disease”. For my mental illness, I haven’t been admitted since 2016."
176156089,Yes the consequences are pretty bad so stop thinking and talking about it!
176156090,yea i kinda think the same tbh…
176156091,"_NAME_ & _NAME_ lied to the FDA, their reps lied to doctors, they valued profits over safety, profits over patients. All they care about is money."
176156092,"yeah, and it was so great the way he fit everything in, the only thing left is the chair but we’ll make room for that in the living room and we can sit in it. Hey an extra seat is always good."
176156093,Haha! Yes Thank you I can imagine it!
176156094,"“Cognitive side-effects are however a significant issue with lithium, and a significant cause for patient suffering and often leads to partial and/or full non-adherence to treatment. Lithium has been associated with impaired memory, word finding difficulties, and impaired recall. Often, my patients have reported a cognitive “dulling” and a loss of cognitive “creativity” with lithium use that they found most disturbing. This does appear to be dose related.” https://www.psychcongress.com/article/effects-lithium-cognitive-symptoms#:~:text=Lithium%20has%20been%20associated%20with,that%20they%20found%20most%20disturbing.

176156095,"My mom and I both agree at this point that I may have autism and she did notice signs but brushed it off because I was not having developmental delays (like low IQ). I didn’t know that she was thinking about autism before until we actually talked! So, we’re at the point of: should I seek a dx of autism? But we’re also saying that I’m too old now and it may be pointless to seek one…it’s just, somehow, better to use autism techniques to manage sensory overstimulation and things like that? My sz was diagnosed not by will so I’ve never taken myself for dx testing- so I don’t know! Any thoughts? I know this is primarily a sz group but your thoughts are more than welcome."
176156096,Is anyone taking broccoli sprouts with risperidone. Is it helping in any way? I?m feeling good. It?s been just about 2 weeks.
176156097,Great job _AT_MENTION_ Thanks so much for sharing. Hope you have a great holiday. Photos never really do them justice. Stay safe
176156098,"I don’t believe at all in high functioning vs low functioning. It gives the false illusion that people in the high functioning category don’t struggle as much, when in reality they are frequently facing symptoms just as severe as their peers, but they have less noticeable coping skills to manage. It also gives people in the low functioning category the false illusion that they just lost the functioning lottery, and can never get better. Functioning levels don’t describe the degree to which someone has a disability. They describe the degree to which outsiders notice their disability."
176156099,that’s nice that you feel well =) i hope things keep improving and you stay well
176156100,ok So I haven’t earned your trust. Or you don’t want the whole forum to know.
176156101,"OMG, WTF is this!!! Haha, _AT_MENTION_, the things you’ve said in this thread…LOL!"
174382040,"ive been on clozapine but it caused low white blood cells…and according to my pdoc ive been on all the AP’s to some degree or another over the past ten yrs im paranoid sz, and positives are pretty bad such as command hallucinations to humiliate myself in public negatives, i have poverty of thought and this undermines me scoially, i feel i cant talk to people as theres little or nothing going on in my mind…my pdoc says this is a negative symptom of sz, being withdrawn …"
176156102,"I agree with Mr _PERSON_. Well if a whole group is too intimidating you could find an accountability buddy to do excerise with, even just 15 minutes is really good"
176156103,Go for it man I mean there’s nothing to loose from going a little creative with your fun. You can play and post it here on forum chat.
176156104,Hopefully you will have some good days soon.
176156105,"With this, I also call myself “physically ill” because I have a physical illness. I would just say, let the person who has a disability to define themselves."
176156106,"If there pdoc I spoke to gets his way, I won’t be allowed to drive This is a huge problem for me if this goes south I really need to get some treatment, but unfortunately I am so scared I will lose my ability to earn money by using my license Before I lost it for two years. If this happened again it would kill me off. I am totally reliant on my drivers license. I need a new _NAME_, but I cannot get one as I have no idea what will happen They review my license once a year, and I need the doctor on my side This is so ?????? up"
176156107,"Yes. I think the paperwork I forgot about, said something on it about psychosis."
176156108,"Oh yeah, you’re right!"
176156109,"He still sounds like a jerk. What you want is important too. If you really want to continue this, maybe you could write down what you want from this deep down and religiously stick to that? Or write down before a date what you would want to happen. He too goes for his own goals. In a healthy relationship you shouldnt have to fight so hard for this though. And yes, similar issues. I will stay out of it. I know i will get hurt and it is against my values."
176156110,Yes _AT_MENTION_ benzos are tranqulizers
176156111,Yes I am safe I hope so.
176156112,i got autism and sz.
174382043,Good luck with Abilify
176156113,_AT_MENTION_ . If your on lithium there’s a protocol for 20 mg Prozac. I needed to take it earlier this year and it worked. Feel better
176156114,"I think my greatest comfort is loneliness, to be honest. I just feel okay now on being lonely and having no one to talk to. Yeah so far I can only trust myself and no one else. But sometimes, I don’t really know who the heck I am and I keep getting confused because my mom keeps saying that I don’t have this and that. I don’t know who to trust or who to lean on to."
176156115,"I believed I was turning into a wizard once, i saw a vision that I was wearing a witches hat and had a green face lol, I was driving a the time and thought my fingernails grew like an itch in a matter of minutes. I also believed my mom and step sister did witchcraft. I believed she put a spell on me at the time. One time I thought I might be a werewolf. I also believed I sold my soul to the devil one time to get a job and I worked for satanic company, which gave me powers after I sold my soul to obtain whatever I wanted, and that I was a false prophet, and a magician. One time I thought I died and was going to hell because I smelt smoke for whatever reason, and my dad was the devil, and that I was just a ghost in this life. And no one saw me even though I thought they did. I’m almost back to my normal self now without medicine! This is all happened this last year"
176156116,I remember friends talking about the show but I never watched it.
176156117,currently my favorite is the whataburger breakfast burger Definitely not good for me
176156118,"hi Wave! Thanks, I didn’t know anyone ever noticed my being here. It’s nice to have been missed!"
176156119,Sounds promising
176156120,Please get back on meds _AT_MENTION_!
176156121,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you’re having a rough time. To be honest, this is the main reason I dont want injections. I’m here if you want to talk. Love your language skills. So interesting in a good way!"
176156122,"i think more actually do struggle, it’s just that they assumed because they are functional when they shower, that they say they dont struggle with it. but they have the same motivation issues i have and such. _AT_MENTION_"
174382044,"I have hopes in Xanomeline, it was shown to be effective for negative and cognitive symptoms, it will be in clinical trial 3 end of this year so maybe in 5 years it will be available. Wikipedia Xanomeline: “It has been studied for the treatment of both Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, particularly the cognitive and negative symptoms. Xanomeline has been shown to have reasonable efficacy for the treatment of schizophrenia symptoms, and one recent human study found robust improvements in verbal learning and short-term memory associated with xanomeline treatment.”"
176156124,"If you can decipher the secret message I put into this poem, you’ll be granted eternal happiness …"
176156125,No I heard it like it was in my ears like someone was following me around calling my names. I never heard voices actually talking like saying sentences just words especially one specific word. But I also had voices in my head saying things but I just ignored it as I thought It was my over reactive imagination.
176156126,I think the same! I only believe in science! I have a university degree in health science domain.
176156127,look just avoid my threads ok
176156128,"No, I think everyone is losing money and family members from this crisis."
176156129,I would pay a mortgage for a house.
176156130,I heard once that alternating is the best option for health. Sometimes water and sometimes mineral water
176156131,Great!! _PHONE_NO_
176156133,It’s not true I had delusions that ever one was witches and evil psychis and working with scientology but now even the voices say it’s not true
176156134,"My grandma was an alcoholic who would visit my parents in Florida when she needed to dry out cuz my parents didn’t have any alcohol in their house…so one day my grandma drank all of my mom’s baking vanilla extract! That’s partly why I don’t drink, too, cuz the addiction gene is so strong in my family. I’m a food addict and cannot buy things like chips or candy cuz I’ll eat it all in a day. I used to weigh over 300 lbs cuz I couldn’t control my intake…now I’m a bit more careful with the foods I buy. I wish you could get your own place, too. Being independent of my family has made such a difference in my life and I could never go back to living with my mom and dad (I lived with them til my mid-30s). You always have the most insightful things to say on this forum and I hope things will get better for you soon."
176156135,How did you stop catatonia?? I feel like I am developping it again even on meds this time!
176156136,Exactly. Not on the money.
176156137,good man _AT_MENTION_
176156138,"_AT_MENTION_, did you guys kick me out of the discord group? I can’t see the group messages anymore."
176156139,The fan above my head Keeps spinning around Silently blocking the sounds Emitting from my mind.
176156140,I agree that as a personality trait can be unpleasant for you and others sometimes but it has it´s possitive side aswell. You usually get more done.
176156141,"God, wouldn’t that be nice? I’ve got the Alien Extravaganza back thanks to stress from my @#$%ing in-laws."
176156142,"Yeah, I just prefer the late night quiet hours. I’ll probably be up until five to six am. And I don’t think I’ve ever actually seen Dark Star before, but I’m very familiar with the film. I read a book about seventies horror movies a long time ago that talked about Dark Star and the whole story of it’s making and production."
176156144,Suicide is not the answer. Are there _USER_ID_ meetings you can go to? What about therapy? Any hobbies you can force yourself to engage in? Get busy to keep your mind off suicide. And you should contact your pdoc immediately and tell him/her you’re suicidal. You need help right now
176156145,I really don’t think nicotine and caffeine is the problem give it time things are just out of whack still from the meds I’ve been through this numerous times
176156146,"I’m still an online dating virgin but i think i got a date, i’m taking her out on the weekend for a nice meal looks like paying some money to get noticed has helped, just hope i don’t screw it up."
176156147,"Yeah, my cat I got for my birthday 9 years ago was right up there with my best gifts. He was mellow, affectionate and good natured, just an all around good guy. As a kid though, a slot car set when I was about 8 or 9 was a favorite. We set it up on the living room floor and raced all day and it was so fun that my dad let me keep it up for about 5 days."
176156148,Because they harassed me at work when I was working. They followed me places. If I wrote in my online journal diary I was going to a movie they would show up and watch me there. They thought I was an agent but I just worked at Best Buy. So they started following me. Then they found out I wasn’t in the CIA so now they think I work for someone else and if I make a mistake they’ll kidnap me and torture me
176156149,wow! So good I read it twice. If the brain is made up of atoms and so many atoms makes a human brain to afford us consciousness. How many atoms are there in the sun and hence its superior consciousness? All hail the Sun God Ra!
176156150,"Technically, this forum is online therapy to some …"
176156151,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, this Youtube channel is run by a friend of mine, _PERSON_. He’s a photographer I’ve shot with many a time over the past two decades. _PERSON_ had a MASSIVE heart attack in Jan of 2017 and had to get an LVAD implanted. Check out his videos, you can see this hasn’t stopped him from enjoying his life. He’s doing so well in fact that he hasn’t put his name on the transplant list for a new heart yet, although he clearly qualifies for it (he’d nearly go straight to the top in fact). YouTube Life on Batteries Back in January, I had a massive heart attack. Overnight, I went from healthy and active to flat on my back in intensive care with end stage heart failure. _USER_ID_ I hope you find _PERSON_ as inspiring as I do. I’m very privileged to know him personally."
176156152,Usually the first symptom is paranoia then along come voices. I hope I can snap out of it quickly and resume the previous dosage if that happens.
176156153,"i think my brain must be a bit different from most because nicotine just makes me heavily sedated and weighed down and a bit nauseous, ive never experience much stimulant like effect from it"
176156154,"OR.,.try sleeping _PERSON_."
176156155,"??? You are NOT a failure. I’m the same. I received a good education and went abroad, which is something not a lot of people get. Getting help doesn’t mean that you’re a failure! We all need help in some ways."
176156156,"Wait, what? Fax machines? Are there any private citizens under the age of seventy who still owns one of these wretched things?"
176156157,"OP seems to have the same problem I have. Encouraging one’s own thoughts, feelings, and delusions. I mean, I feel fine when doing healthy things, but then I get triggered mostly when I’m on the phone or computer. When I’m driving or something, everything is normal and peaceful."
176156158,Its always good when a pdoc is willing to listen to what you want from the treatment…
176156159,I can’t watch TV as I have no concentration and some news make me paranoid.
176156160,I am getting sick of having to force myself to do things. Something is going to snap. It certainly did yesterday. I had the police come to my home.
176156161,"Not for me, I love these shows. Turn off the TV whenever protests are mentioned instead."
176156162,Syrians make excellent doctors. My Uncle is a doctor and so are his 3 sons. They are top notch doctors. _AT_MENTION_
176156163,What sort of things would you want to accomplish?
176156164,I can play video games for long periods of time…but I couldn’t read to save myself. It depends on the person. Their symptoms and the course of the disorder. Things like negatives can really make you unable to do things. Some other things may be fine.
174382052,On the first of September me and Ms. Schizophrenia will celebrate 28 years together in holy purgatory. I’ll celebrate by eating a cake and going into a diabetic coma (just kidding).
176156165,"I can’t tell you as for sure, I recommend contacting your Doctor _PERSON_ if you are feeling this way! Maybe you need to be hospitalized, I am not a medical professional and don’t claim to be. Please seek the help of a trusted professional! Also, are you in any form counseling??"
176156166,I will ask my psychiatrist 8 Jan. I think 120-160mg should work but that might have side effects as its a high dose
176156167,"Effexor, Pristiq. Trying Prozac now, because the other ones make me delusional."
176156168,I’m not surprised. I want to live in Italy now. _PERSON_
176156169,Im more used to singing choral music. And chants out of the Psalter. Used to be a Catherdral chorister as a child. Magnificat and Nunc Dimmitis and all that out of the Psalter at 16. Not these days tho - Smoking and Drinking ruined my Treble and Tenor voice Years ago. Used to get paid 40 quid for singing at weddings on a Saturday. Thats all dead now - Its all “Happy Clappy” with electric guitars and twats trying to heal you. The old Church of the book of Common Prayer - Matins and Evensong is replaced by twats on micro-phones these days. Not a decent SATB Choir anymore round here.
176156170,"I apologize for my dumb posts, chaotic posts, depressive posts, etc, that I’ve posted lately. I’ve been really unstable. I was severely depressed on Thursday, last week, to the point I thought I was going to commit suicide. Every day is difficult to get through. I can hardly work at my job – I can’t focus, my brain is boggled and racing, the voices are being bothersome but not constant. But yesterday I was feeling good. I wore a dress, even. I dressed up all nice and pretty. I got through work fine. I went home wanting to drink. I argued and was really irrational to my husband when he said I shouldn’t be drinking yet until I’m more stable. Of course, he got really upset by me being argumentative and disrespectful, so he left the apartment for a bit. Me, in my hypomanic brain, decided it was a good idea to walk to the train station, ride to the next stop in another city, then walk all the way to the closest shopping mall… At 8pm or so. I planned to sleep outside (WTF was I thinking) on
ce the mall closed, cause I didn’t want to be alone at the apartment. I ended up getting back home safely, though - my husband picked me up. I think I’m hypomanic again. I made an appointment with my primary/general doctor today. I hope he can help me get my new medicine by tonight. I don’t want to be so unstable all weekend. I also get a hormone implant (Nexplanon) in my arm today to help even out my crazy hormones. I get psychotic around my menstrual period, which I’m just now ending. Thanks for putting up with my crap. Nobody has ever been mean to me yet, here, when I’m spewing nonsense. I appreciate the support I’ve gotten here. Thanks, guys and gals and in-betweens. You dudes rock."
176156171,"I have tried many prescriptions for insomnia and none are effective As for the worrying about demons I’m not sure what med he would prescribe. They haven’t actually been talking to me or anything when im awake so I don’t think its a psychosis thing, I just keep having constant nightmares and sleep paralysis regarding them and its freaking me out. So if there’s a med for nightmares I guess that would help."
176156172,slim tream and ready 2 roll
176156173,We have some growing in a pot I didn’t think that much of it but nice to see it has some benifits
174382054,I was deeper in sh!t when I was on Abilify. Now on Risperdal no addiction issues.
176156174,Yeah you’re right I will stay on the APs
176156175,close eyes and breath ? drift away go on adventures have sc with hot women wake up clean up looil
176156176,Did your family tell you they were taking you somewhere or did they actually take you?
176156177,My childhood was a hell. I was abused constantly. The hospital is another hell
176156178,I totally agree about the energy bit in The Matrix being embarrassing. I can’t get that silly image of the duracell battery out of my head.
176156179,"This is triggering but I was scared of saying it here. I had voices tell me about sex with my mother and to rape her. I won’t say what happened but I didn’t rape her. My psychiatrist helped me with this bcz my mother told him what I did to her. This happened the same day during my psychosis when I tried suicide bcz voices told me I am immortal God. Without meds I have thoughts about having sex with my mother. My mother told me a real story that happened in the US where a schizophrenic killed his mother and ate her heart. I think she was scared that I do the same. Anyways, its the boss of the psychiatrists that helped me with this, he was specialized in child and adolescents psychiatry. He was the best psychiatrist I ever had but he died a couple years ago."
174382055,I think it’s impossible to fully get rid of some of the symptoms. From my experience my negatives are due to meds and those meds are powerful
176156180,What do you mean?
176156181,"Thanks _PERSON_. I don’t know yet how I am going to proceed with the forum (or not) but that aside I wish you all the best with everything, I hope your mental health improves and I hope you continue succeeding with your weight loss goals!"
176156182,"Never had anything like that, no."
176156183,"it was easy, a minister and a member of my congregation officially saved me, i am still to be baptised though but i think i was always in the book of life, you may be as well"
176156184,"If I recall correctly, you said before that you need the highest dose of the Invega Sustenna injection, the lower dose didn’t work for you enough. I don’t think it’s a good idea to go off your injections then, you won’t have any room to go up if your previous dose is no longer effective. You could create a big problem. And an AD is not going to work like an AP does. You still have the sza, you need to take your meds for it. I know it’s hard, but that’s just the way it is. I’d take blah over psychosis any day. Don’t forget what that was like, you don’t want to go back to full blown psychosis, or back to a hospital!"
176156185,I got a lot of negative attention and I was hard to be around. My siblings don’t resent me for it now
176156186,Thanks. I will surely talk to my psychiatrist.
176156187,Thanks. I will talk to my doctor. I just hate changing meds. I don’t handle many well and the process is so aggravating.
174382058,cool stuff man. great.
174382057,"I always kind of wondered that too. I am grateful for getting SSDI, when people like my therapist or my sisters complain we should get more , I am surprised because I’m grateful to get anything, I think SSDI is the best feal in town. But I occasionally wonder how and why other people get more than me."
176156188,"I love to have aesthetic body, but i am not hungry anymore to do the work outs."
176156189,"Human beings are riddled with contradictions, and recent research has cast strong doubts on the cognitive dissonance construct. It is possible to be, on the one hand, a staunch atheist, and on the other to have religious experiences. I don’t see how this apparent tension should be dismissed as psychotic."
176156190,This is pretty sad I actually can relate
176156191,"I´m so hungry, and today I bought a steak It is ok. In my kitchen, I cook it slow to preserve, every smell, in the flesh. yeee yeee yeahhhh"
176156192,"I am addicted to gaming.I am lazy to read,and lazy to watch video,tv series.Gaming isn’t really that bad,but IMO it’s still not a normal adult should engage in normally.I’ll rather read or spend time watching Netflix,I feel I learnt more doing those then gaming chasing after rank,glory ingame"
176156193,I think you can only work 16 hours a week if you on esa but not 100 percent sure …
176156194,You don’t have family or friends to talk to? If not you can talk to ppl here.
176156195,_AT_MENTION_ nihilistically hopeful… I think you just coined a new phrase LOL
176156196,"Whatever you do, _AT_MENTION_ , do NOT eat sugar-free gummy bears. The customer reviews of sugar-free Haribo gummy bears on Amazon are hilarious. Here’s an example (10,236 people found this review helpful according to amazon) https://www.amazon.com/review/R2JGNJ5ZPJT4YC"
176156197,Still learning through therapy to deal with my childhood sexual abuse. I will never forgive but I’m working on not letting it control my mental health. It’s hard especially when it’s triggered. At least I have learned not to do self harm coping skill and work in my art journal. I understand you. Good luck
174382061,? think there is no ideal place for sz patients.everwhere has unique different difficulties for us.i m living in 3 world country.(actually technically its first world country but anyways).Here is biggest difficulties for sz patient personal ignorance and powerty.luckly i can find every medicine except for some really new ones .other than this all struggles are same.i experience lot of difficulties at here just because of i m mentally ill.but everything is about your mentality and your way of thinking.only saver of you is your will.not where you are living.

176156200,Oh wow _AT_MENTION_ ! Glad your alright!
176156201,"Thanks so much, _AT_MENTION_-- you really put things into perspective for me. Means a lot!"
176156202,"Doc gave me Fanapt samples today, took me off Haldol. I have to titrate, so I start 1mg twice a day tomorrow, eventually going to 6mg twice a day by the end of a week. Anyone have experiences with this med? Thanks"
176156203,"No, they come when they want to and ruin my day and I can’t punch them or have them arrested like I could with a stalker, so I get pretty freaking steamed."
176156204,Thank you? _AT_MENTION_
176156205,That’s early? _AT_MENTION_ 151515
176156206,Do they watch you while you eat medicine? Or you can secretly not eat medicine
176156207,I don’t have issues with age gaps like that if it’s short term dating but not for long term dating. Cos I don’t want them to die on me etc. And then I’m alone
176156208,I feel bad for isolating so much too. It’s been a big part of my mental condition. Remember we aren’t alone in our aloneness though. There may be more people like this than we think for various reasons.
176156209,It’s a good thing you decided on a Lab. They’re a very lovable and calm dog species that don’t demand much attention once they are grown ups. They’re normally everybody’s pal. You’ll get through this fine.
176156210,It does take a lot of strength. That’s half of my battle for sure. The other half is finding better ways to spend my time.

176156211,"It’s a phenomena I first noticed with the receptionist in my dentists office. He had been there a long time and must of picked up quite a few things about dentistry but when I had questions about my teeth that I wanted to ask the doctor he started telling me what I should do. I later found out he was partially right about some things but some of his other advice was dead wrong, even harmful and a few times I was just cringing with embarrassment for him because his ego was at play and he wasn’t even sure himself if he was right but he didn’t want to back down from what he said. I can’t remember specifics but he retired a few months ago anyways. This last incident today was because my PCP told me to cut out red meat from my diet about 4 months ago. I don’t see her for another three months but I called to ask her if I could still eat a nice steak or hamburger occasionally. The guy (who is new) who works the desk asked her and he came back to the phone and told me she said yes. Two seconds la
ter I asked 'how much is “occasionally”? And he hesitated and I asked him if she meant I can I eat a steak once a week or once a month or what. He told me, “Well, that means if you are eating a hamburger once a day than cut that in half.” To me, that didn’t sound right. Having red meat once a day does not sound like “cutting out all red meat.” I cut it out completely except for a couple of slips but his advice just didn’t sound right. I know these interns want to show their knowledge and maybe boost their ego instead of being “just the receptionist.” This doesn’t happen a lot to me but it irritates me when they do it occasionally. The issue is important because red meat will affect the condition I’m being treated for so I’m going to wait a couple of days until I can talk to the Doctor directly."

174382063,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction and an elevation of lactate are observed in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). However, it is unknown whether mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the presence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations and comorbid clinical conditions. We aimed to identify systemic mitochondrial abnormalities in blood samples of patients with SZ that may have a high impact on the brain due to its high bioenergetic requirements. METHODS: Case/control study between 57 patients with SZ and 33 healthy controls (HCs). We measured lactate levels at baseline, during 15 min of exercise (at 5, 10 and 15 min) and at rest. We also evaluated the presence of clinical conditions associated with mitochondrial disorders (CAMDs), measured the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR, a subclinical inflammatory marker), and analyzed mtDNA variation and copy number. RESULTS: Linear models adjusting for covariates showed that patients with SZ exhibited higher elevation of lactate than HCs during 
exercise but not at baseline or at rest. In accordance, patients showed higher number of CAMDs and lower mtDNA copy number. Interestingly, CAMDs correlated with both lactate levels and mtDNA copy number, which in turn correlated with the NLR. Finally, we identified 13 putative pathogenic variants in the mtDNA of 11 participants with SZ not present in HCs, together with a lactate elevation during exercise that was significantly higher in these 11 carriers than in the noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with systemic mitochondrial malfunctioning in SZ and pinpoint lactate metabolism and mtDNA as targets for potential therapeutic treatments. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Increased blood lactate levels during exercise and mitochondrial DNA alterations converge on mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia.

176156250,"I highly recommend substituting the medication with vitamins that improve your state, maintaining a healthy diet and sleep schedule, and keeping in touch with people or getting a regular dose of being around in a place with other people. Also, I think you should work with your doctor/psychiatrist to wean yourself off of the medication per their advice. I have tried more than a few times to quit on my own, but these are drugs that our bodies and mind have built a dependency on, so it has to be done with all safety nets in place. Also, I think you should pay attention to anything that is a recreational drug (if you do any), for example I can’t do any and I can’t even do caffeine.

174382069,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Plasma monoamines change under dopamine supersensitivity psychosis in patients with schizophrenia: A comparison with first-episode psychosis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England), Jan 21 2020 Patients with first-episode psychosis respond well to initial antipsychotic treatment, but among patients experiencing a relapse of psychosis, the response rate falls to approximately 30%. The mechanism of this discrepancy has not been clarified, but the development of dopamine supersensitivity psychosis with the underlying up-regulation of post-synaptic dopamine D2 receptors could be involved in this lesser response. It is uncertain whether elevated dopamine synthesis and release occurs in patients with dopamine supersensitivity psychosis, in contrast to those with first-episode psychosis.We examined a first-episode psychosis group (n=6) and a chronic schizophrenia group, i.e. patients experiencing relapse (n=23) including those 
who relapsed due to dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (n=18). Following the initiation of treatment, we measured the patients' blood concentrations of homovanillic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol at two weeks and four weeks after the baseline measurements.The first-episode psychosis group tended to show decreased homovanillic acid, accompanied by an improvement of symptoms. The chronic schizophrenia group showed no alteration of homovanillic acid or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol over the treatment period. These results were the same in the dopamine supersensitivity psychosis patients alone.Our findings suggest that unlike first-episode psychosis, the release of dopamine from presynaptic neurons did not increase in relapse episodes in the patients with dopamine supersensitivity psychosis. This indirectly indicates that the development of supersensitivity of post-synapse dopamine D2 receptor is involved in relapse in dopamine supersensitivity psychosis patients."

176156331,Yeah man since I got a part time job I don’t feel this way as much. At least I can tell people I work. It seems like it could be a lot easier to date too if you have a job. I used to feel like more of a pariah.

176156336,"Thanks for all the info! That is great (getting so much info). The results are less great… I then still kind of hope it helps with the other (trauma, depression) symptoms i still have though, which are more on the forefront 95% of the time."

174382089,"Good on ya, _PERSON_! That’s a truly wonderful accomplishment. I don’t do drugs myself, and I’ve switched to drinking light beer every now and then. I don’t really get drunk anymore. I find I get tired after a few suds…then have a bite to eat…then take a nap. I think because I’m on Abilify injections, and I have that juice in my system, it prevents me from drinking too much. At least, I think that is what’s happening."

Other than that I’m close to being as normal as possible. This has been a miracle drug for me. Hang in there and I hope everything works out well for you!!!"
174382090,"I don’t need to take benzos anymore because my catatonia mostly went away with anti-psychotics. An OTC alternative to benzos is the plant Kava Kava (non-habit forming) or the plant Valerian root. ECT is electroconvulsive therapy, aka electro-shock. It is a safe and effective procedure nowadays, given while the patient is unconscious (anesthetized), and almost never has long term side effects. It has an efficacy of treating depression, mania, psychosis, and especially catatonia at a rate far higher than medications: about 70-90%. It is also frequently given to elderly populations because it is actually safer in terms of side effect profile and risks than many medications. For example, anti-psychotics in elderly populations can increase the risk of dementia and death, so ECT is frequently given as a replacement with miraculous results. I received it 16 times and I plan to get more. It genuinely saved my life. It is typically given in one course 6-12 times, starting with unilateral, which has almost 
no side effects, and then the frequency is decreased until it is given once every 6 weeks for about 2 years. This is called maintenance ECT and isn’t always done and is completely optional, but can be used to maintain the beneficial results and avoid relapse. ECT is highly effective for catatonia. Some insurance companies won’t allow ECT until at least 4 medications have been tried. Just FYI. And doctors are sometimes reluctant to give it, but it is life saving and I believe a “secret cure” for depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, and catatonia."

176156368,"This thread made me think of a poem written by _NAME_ in 1934. Note that the definition of pelf is money or riches. I had to look it up since it’s not a commonly used word. The Man In The Glass When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf, And the world makes you King for a day, Then go to the mirror and look at yourself, And see what that guy has to say. For it isn’t your Father, or Mother, or Wife, Who judgement upon you must pass. The feller whose verdict counts most in your life Is the guy staring back from the glass. He’s the feller to please, never mind all the rest, For he’s with you clear up to the end, And you’ve passed your most dangerous, difficult test If the guy in the glass is your friend. You may be like _NAME_ and “chisel” a plum, And think you’re a wonderful guy, But the man in the glass says you’re only a bum If you can’t look him straight in the eye. You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years, And get pats on the back as you pass, But your 
final reward will be heartaches and tears If you’ve cheated the guy in the glass."
176156369,"I totally understand. It’s 11pm and my in-laws are blasting the tv still. No way can I even attempt to sleep until they turn it off. I cannot wait until I have my own place again, but it’s still several months off at best."

Even one doc told me, that I took too many aps… They made of me a guinea pig tbh… 11 aps for ten years, I did only this… Only Zyprexa works for me… But yeah, it smashes me in the evening.

He called me to his office and asked what is going on, so I told him. He asked did I need an antidepressant, and I told him I thought so. He thought something else was going on besides the car, and I told him I have been very amotivational for a while now. I had to force myself to get out of the bed and do something. He asked me questions and listened to what I said."

No the reason I’m listening tonight is because I think they are real tonight for some reason, just a notion. You see I believe the _NAME_ are sending me messages through other peoples posts on this site because everytime I put my phone down and pick it back up it is on some random post which says things relevant to my current situation for example ‘go on the run’ those words will be in the post. So today I got a reply from a guy who said ‘schizo dosent exist’ these words my voices used several several times and it just added to my delusion. I thought this guys account was faked and being used by the _NAME_, I think they have been making people hear voices for years and they have several accounts on this site posing as schizophrenics So that’s why I think the _NAME_ are communicating with me in my head tonight, I keep asking them to turn up the voices so I know it’s real so I can 
get my answer as to if my voices were real or not"
176156395,i wouldn’t go off your AP… They put you on it for a reason huh… and if you stop then it will come back most likely.

176156404,"Glutamate does cross the blood brain barrier, it just takes a lot of it to get an effect, like glycine. Which makes sense given that their role in the brain is similar. Glutamate is a co factor to activate NMDA receptors just like glycine. I use DMG and D-Aspartic Acid to activate NMDA receptors. They’re agonists at the glycine and glutamate sites respectively. It’s like taking the recommended dosage of glycine and glutamate to activate receptors. Works well. Recently the place I get my D- Aspartic acid from went out of business so I’m looking to get my hands on some glutamate or D-Aspartic acid to take with my DMG for my NMDA activating supplementing regime."
174382103,I used to get muscle spasms in my legs when trying to go to sleep. Just a quick contraction or twitching. That has gone away since I switched to Abilify.

176156407,"Yeah, I’ve definitely made the change. I changed how I ate in August/September and have mostly been eating whole foods, just produce and unprocessed meats since then. But now I’ve slowly been adding in cheeses and coconut milk and now yogurt and a lot of frozen fruit for smoothies and almonds for almond butter. Ugh. I need to cut a lot out again because I’m getting more sugar than I would prefer. But it’s definitely been a lifestyle change that I’m very happy I made."
176156408,"I cannot work at all because I get paranoid around people, my sza gives me very poor judgement, I don’t own a car and I cannot drive, I suffer from severe, frequent insomnia, and severe daily migraines, and I have degenerative osteoarthritis all over my body."

176156411,"Same here. I really hope this new vaccine works well. It’s going to be so important to get things back on track and protect people. 2020 has been an absolute mess. We just came out of a lockdown, and into another one. They’re letting 3 households mix this Christmas, and I worry it’s just going to make things much much worse. Cases are very low where I am, but we’re very close to Kent and London, where it’s really bad!"
174382113,"Wow. That really sucks, real nice to know you are doing a lot better, what A PS helped? The reason I asked the question is because of my bizarre behavior, which in this perspective I find it disturbing.

176156412,"some employers punish employees who are efficient and finish quickly, by giving them more work. your boss must not be like that."
174382104,I think its both but not sure. I still had some negative symptoms without meds but maybe positive symptoms worsen negative symptoms too.
176156413,I never self diagnosed. It took me about 6 or 7 years to figure out I was actually sick. The doctors did all the diagnosis and surprisingly he got it right. My second pdoc.

174382118,"Cannabidiol is a partial D2 agonist, although that’s not its only apparent mechanism of action. PubMed Central (PMC) Cannabidiol is a partial agonist at dopamine D2High receptors, predicting its... Although all current antipsychotics act by interfering with the action of dopamine at dopamine D2 receptors, two recent reports showed that 800 to 1000?mg of cannabidiol per day alleviated the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia, although cannabidiol... It was found that cannabidiol inhibited the binding of radio-domperidone with dissociation constants of 11 nm at dopamine D2High receptors and 2800 nm at dopamine D2Low receptors, in the same biphasic manner as a dopamine partial agonist antipsychotic drug such as aripiprazole. The clinical doses of cannabidiol are sufficient to occupy the functional D2High sites. it is concluded that the dopamine partial agonist action of cannabidiol may account for its clinical antipsychotic effects."

176156551,"Study links genes with function across the human brain Many psychiatric disorders have genetic causes, but the exact mechanism of how genes influence higher brain function remains a mystery. A new study provides a map linking the genetic signature of functions across the human brain, a tool that may provide new targets for future treatments. Led by _PERSON_, a researcher at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) of McGill University, a group of scientists performed machine learning analysis of two Open Science datasets: the gene expression atlas from the _NAME_ Human Brain Atlas and the functional association map from Neurosynth. This allowed them to find associations between gene expression patterns and functional brain tasks such as memory, attention, and mood. Interestingly, the team found a clear genetic signal that separated cognitive processes, like attention, from more affective processes, like fear. This separation can be traced to gene expression in specific cell types and mo
lecular pathways, offering key insights for future research into psychiatric disorders. Cognition, for example, was linked more to the gene signatures of inhibitory or excitatory neurons. Affective processes, however, were linked to support cells such as microglia and astrocytes, supporting a theory that inflammation of these cells is a risk factor in mental illness. The genetic signature related to affect was centred on a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex, which has been shown to be vulnerable in mental illness. Published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour on March 25, 2021, this study draws a direct link between gene expression and higher brain function, by mapping gene signatures to functional processes across the human brain. “In this work we found molecular signatures of different psychological processes,” says _PERSON_. “This is exciting because it provides a first step to understand how human thoughts and emotions arise from specific genes, biological pathways and cell types.

In 2013, I was tranquilized after I was crying in the hallway over not being at home, so the nurse lady called the security on me and had the police escort me to my room to tranquilize me like a wild animal. Then after they left, I got back up, picked up a chair and attempted to smash the lens of the surveillance camera in the room. It took the longest period for me to be put out that they’ve ever seen in any patient, going off what my mom told me. The second time was because I kept ringing them up in my room during a panic attack so they used two tranquilizers on me. I ??????? hate these places. And I got bullied for being tranquilized by other patients there too. That experience only made MUCH worse off than I already was before I even entered.

176156579,"Over the years I have come up with several reasons, “Why?” Now I am going to just say, “I don’t know why.” For example, why is it so hard to wake up in the morning? Or why do I have to feel bad sometimes. Or why is my schizophrenia like it is? This idea is comforting to me."
176156580,"I know they say what they are suppose to say and don’t think they mean any harm and such. But I just discuss about this the way that also occurs in me. I would like to work on my Sz as a scientist, i.e. not being just a patient. Certain psychological tasks need some special kind of methods to get rid of their “witch” and for me, this is a classic example where I would do so."
176156581,I have my obsessions every day. Its getting ridicouluss.
176156582,"I hear you. My extended family doesn’t know about this, nor does my brother- my only sibling. My mom and dad said that it’s going to shock him. Or, in better words, they’re ashamed. If it is too shameful to be told to my own brother, what else is shameful? I just want to die already- I’m tired of living. Society is not at all concerned about us, nor they care about our well-being. I was abandoned from it a long time ago and I’m sure my entire country hates me. I feel unwanted, abandoned, discarded, and worthless. I will die cold when I get old. I’m sorry for ranting. But I just want to let you know that you are loved despite what others tell you. Don’t end up in a mindset like mine."
176156583,"So about a year ago I tried to leave via deep cuts. They healed quite nicely. I was stupid and cut on my arm because I wasnt really thinking about how it would look. Anyway, they still are quite apparent. It was 70 stitches in total, and I’m worried about what to say if someone asks. I was thinking of saying I’m a bush nerd and took a nasty fall -believable? What would you say? Cuts are also rather jagged, any tattoo ideas? Would a tattoo even cover it up? Also in todays world, would you say it can be acceptable to have tattoos in the workplace? thanks."

174382150,LS! I hope to make it to 90! I am now 61 and in good health. I am aware that the average life expectancy of a male with schizophrenia in the Western World is 59.9 years.

176156588,"_AT_MENTION_ It’s an excellent idea to see a dietitian. I hired one when I used to be vegan, because I needed some guidance about what a balanced vegan diet looked like. Other that eating cut-up fruits and vegetables, I didn’t know what to eat. She helped me a lot in only three sessions. It was a very good investment. She came to my house with various groceries and showed me specific recipes. I used to make a wonderful vegan chili, and pico de gallo, I wish I could remember how I did it! If you’re vegan, it’s a good idea to supplement your Vitamin B12 if you don’t already. I was vegan for about a year and a half, and I ended up with dangerously low B12. I don’t know exactly why a vegan diet can cause that deficiency. I had a wound that wouldn’t heal, and finally they did bloodwork to see if I had anything going on. Luckily my doctor thought to test my vitamin levels, I had very low B12 and D. It’s probably a good idea to invest in a good multivitamin."
176156589,I’m not really a big fan of music. I mean I enjoy it sometimes. It’s just that I’m not obsessive over it or anything. I’ve never really listened to music religiously. The only time I came close to that was Kotton Mouth Kings in ninth grade. I’m not really into one particular genre solely. All genres are good and add to the music landscape.

Most recently trips to several behavioral wards and psych hospitals totally screwed up my meds. This endangered my physical health as depakote, which didn’t do anything good to begin with, raised my blood glucose sky high, which lead to false diagnosis of severe mood disorder. Psych wards and hospitals here don’t treat you properly. I was never in the sort of crisis where I was contemplating hurting myself or others. I absolutely blame my mother, who more often than not, isn’t med compliant with her depression and anxiety, and still probably wouldn’t admit that her bouts of unexplained anger, are no one’s fault but hers, for having me hospitalized again and again.

174382173,"2015, dropped out of physics school. 2017 tried mathematics school and left. 2018/19 March realised there was a schizophrenia problem which I had realised in 2015 but dismissed emotionally. 2020, passed the second yr of a finance programme and started an economics programme. Negative symptoms include tiredness (perhaps due to a different condition however) and a bipolar sense of motivation. Good is that I kept trying to get through education and this attempt is showing progress. Bad is that I feel held back by thoughts of schizophrenic symptoms returns and also strongly discouraged by prognosis lack of success stories Your post makes me happier, I’m happy for both you and us all because it offers hope that psychosis can be dealt with. And I’m sure it will be dealt with if it ever tried to return ! Well done for your recovery, the self, in my understanding. Definitely plays a big role in your recovery potential or levels.

Ever watch ‘Limitless’? If I’m right about the schizophrenia cure, it could be my greatest achievement in life or one in the history of humanity. Not sure how it came to be unless I got knowledge from elsewhere or some alien help. I feel like I got this unique ability (probably one of a few) that can remember my past lives in a loop or iteration similar to “Edge of Tomorrow” where I can remember the life I had before. They or “the groups” tried to wipe my mind many times and even give me possibly insanity (I don’t know) but I still remember some things. The mind wipes do work but maybe I just been a “good boy”. People were extremely jealous of my mind and memories and were ??????? angry as hell. People also dismiss and deny it and don’t believe it. Think _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ for instance. I feel like my 
IQ in my past lives was as high as 155-180 and when I was an alien possibly over 200. I don’t know. I’m talking cosmic time now measured in the millions or billions of past lives."

I’ve also been told repeatedly that I should escape my schizophrenia somehow, and that I should know how to do it, because I’m supposed to be a god. These days they mainly do the following things: Tell me that I’m going to be tortured after death (many times each day) Tell something regarding the theories of why I will be tortured, like often comparing the actions of other people to me, and showing how they seem to be more intelligent or better than I am (according to their theory: I was a bad person because I was stupid, and this limited intellect is a property of the soul and persists after death.

I am only 20 pounds from my short-term weight loss goal of 219. At 219, I will have lost 100 pounds! I have been eating a snack around 3:30 p.m. for the last three days - 2 cups of raw cauliflower, 2 baby cucumbers, and 8 grape tomatoes. It really helps me not be too hungry at dinner time so I eat too fast. It’s only 84 calories so it’s easy to fit it into my day and not go over 1400 calories total. I am going to continue to integrate this snack, it will also probably help when I am working full-time and not able to eat dinner at 5:30 like I do right now. I had my second day of not needing my cane when out of the house. I can really feel the difference in pressure on my spine injury now that I’m down 80 pounds. I hope I can continue without the cane.

I was only delusional my first two years with the disorder and had similar delusions, but they faded after a couple years of treatment. I was taking off in a plane during a visit to California back when I lived in _NAME_ and noticed the thousands of people below, like ants, and it made me realize how few people know about me. Helped me cement the knowledge that nobody knows who I am. Once you realize that, it really takes the pressure off. It doesn’t sound like it’s helping you cope though. Cope with what, loneliness?

174382228,"Hi, I’m new here. My diagnosis is schizophrenia. I’ve known about this forum for a while now, but I guess now I want to hear some views on something that’s bothering me. I feel like I’ve been in a process of losing everything that makes me who I am more and more as time goes on. Pretty much every day, for most of the day, I do nothing except alternate between pacing back and forth and sitting down. I guess it’s not like I do literally nothing, because sometimes I just feel like I need to do something at all, but when that happens all I can think of trying is things that I’ve liked in the past, such as video games or watching documentaries online. The problem is, I can’t do these things for very long now because they’re just not interesting or engaging like they used to be, so at best I get a small break from doing nothing at all but it’s not particularly fulfilling. What’s weird is, no matter how much I tell myself that I must just be changing, it feels like all that’s happeni
ng is my mind is being wiped clean and left blank. I can’t seem to want to try anything new to do. I also can’t seem to force myself to try anything new if I don’t feel myself wanting it. It’s like my mind just shuts down at the thought of making myself try so I end up doing nothing. (I swear I mean it, I really think the usual “just do it” advice won’t work in my case.) I’m hoping that somehow this problem is just due to the medication I’ve been on. With other antipsychotics I’ve been on, I’ve been capable of working and doing things sometimes in my free time, despite still having the pacing problem, but they were not working well on my positive symptoms. I’ve been on risperidone now for over a year, gradually going up to 6mg and staying on that for about 6 months, which has worked best so far on my positive symptoms, but I kept getting the feeling it was making it hard to do things in general. Recently I added 75mg of effexor, and it made me feel like I’m suddenly capable of workin
g, so I got a job and tried, but didn’t last long. This made me think about the time I’ve been on risperidone and I realized that anything important I’ve tried on this medicine, I have not been capable of doing, so I brought this up to my psychiatrist and she agreed it would be a good idea for me to switch. I’m in the process of transitioning to latuda. Anyway, has anyone here gone through something similar? If so, did you find it was helped by switching medications, or did you do something else about it? I’d greatly appreciate any feedback. Thanks."

Would that make life special or unspecial? What about the anthropic principle? Is life just a small probability or a random occurrence? I don’t think life is special anymore. I think we live in a computer simulation. I believe in God though. I’m not a nihilist or solipsistic. For me, the meaning of life is understanding how to escape my time loop and understand all the theories of the universe. And to let go. That I cannot change my past nor my future. That the future is not my issue. What goes on in life I just have to ignore. I think accomplishments in life are very crucial to the meaning and value of my life. I would like to have a career whether I work for myself or some small company. Like a computer engineer or computer programmer. I would like enough money to support myself and then some. If it’s God, then my life has purpose and me

174382249,"To decrease negative symptoms. I had less negative symptoms on Latuda but I had some positive symptoms and some catatonia/freezing. On weaker doses/APs I also tend to be aggressive with ppl like when they talk about politics and religion. I threatened some on fb online. My brother read that schizophrenics can have a hard time with empathy and understanding others which can cause aggression. He said not all people think like me and that I shouldn’t be aggressive if they don’t think like me. I was even aggressive with my own family. He told me to stay on my Risperdal bcz I have been the best on it since having my sz.

176156958,"ive been on wellbutrin for a few weeks (300mg) and im amazed that i wasn’t prescribed this a long time ago. Ive been showering, been playing video games etc. I hadn’t showered since September of last year and ive showered two times in a week now… Ive also been playing video games that i haven’t touched in years. My main severe negative symptoms are i don’t bathe for weeks or months, i cant enjoy video games, im socially isolated, cant hold a job ect. I was a skeptic as antidepressant treatment for negative symptoms is not studied very well but wellbutrin is a different type of antidepressant. Its a shame to.because my teeth are all rotted, if i was prescribed wellbutrin years ago my teeth would probably be in much better condition.Im definitely not 100% my old self but id say im better by at least 40-50%. Ive also tried sarcosine and nac which did nothing, been on many antipsychotics etc. If you have severe negative symptoms like me its worth a shot to ask your doctor for wellbutrin. Ther

176157012,"_AT_MENTION_ The bicycle will definitely help you lose some weight. Burning that many calories will make a good difference. As for diet changes, I recommend calorie counting. There are two widely used weight loss websites - Sparkpeople and MyFitnessPal . Both have excellent calorie counters in them so you can set up a goal, get a calorie range, and log your nutrition every day to make sure you stay on track. Be sure to tell the program you plan to burn that many calories per week so it will consider that, you will get a higher calorie range to make sure you have enough nutrition each day. Calorie counting works. I have lost 24 pounds since the middle of March, and I am on Zyprexa that is normally notorious for weight gain. Changing your diet and doing exercise is the way to go!

need to take a break for your own sake. when you disregard your boundaries in one area, you might cause more stress for yourself when you try to accommodate when youre not ready. take care of yourself, if not for just your own wellbeing, then for her wellbeing too."

174382262,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Disability among patients with schizophrenia: A hospital-based study. OO Fakorede, A Ogunwale and AO Akinhanmi, The International journal of social psychiatry , Dec 30 2019 Schizophrenia has been described as the most disabling mental disorder, and patients with schizophrenia have been said to be disabled mostly in self-care, occupation, sexual relation and social relationship domains. Previous authors have studied disability among this study population. However, the limitations of these previous works include non-report of the prevalence rates of disability, report on disability limited to only a particular domain of life and the utilization of disability instruments fraught with significant weaknesses.To determine the prevalence, severity, domains and correlates of disability among outpatients with schizophrenia at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Aro, Abeokuta in Ogun State, Nigeria.It was a cross-sectional study conducted among three hundred consenting adult outpatients with schi
zophrenia attending the Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Aro, Abeokuta, Ogun State. Each participant was interviewed with the sociodemographic questionnaire, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the 36-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule.The prevalence of disability was 78% (with 22% having no disability in any of the domains). Most were disabled in the mild to moderate range. Seventy-seven percent (77%) had mild to moderate disability while only 1% had severe disability. Excluding those free of disability, 98.7% of those with disability had mild to moderate form while only 1.3% had severe form. Highest prevalence rates for disability were reported in the 'participation in society' and 'getting along' domains while the lowest rates were reported in the 'activities' (household, work, school) and 'self-care' domains. Of all the sociodemographic and clinical variables explored, only the PANSS positive, negative and total scores demons
trated significant relationships with disability.Consistent with existing literature, disability is very prevalent among patients with schizophrenia and it is associated with higher levels of illness severity. Clinicians have a role in limiting disability by focusing on early and comprehensive treatment approaches."

It’s just a matter of continuing to make good choices each day. I’m glad the Slimfast is working well for you! My mom does a fast every year from Holy Thursday through noon on Easter Sunday. She uses Slimfast for that to keep her vitamins up. _AT_MENTION_ My short-term weight loss goal is 219. That will be 100 pounds lost. I am currently at 249.8, so 250. I plan to maintain the 219 for about three months and then starting to lose again to reach my long-term goal of 180. I think I will be done at that point, I don’t want 
to put in the work to get lower than that, I think it would be too hard. I am big boned, so 180 looks good on me. Besides, 139 pounds lost is a lot! I am slowly doing it!"

176157069,"ScienceDaily Scientists show how parasitic infection causes seizures, psychiatric illness... Neuroscientists describe how the common Toxoplasma gondii parasite prompts the loss of inhibitory signaling in the brain by altering the behavior of nearby cells called microglia. _PERSON_ and his collaborator, _NAME_, recently reported that long-term Toxoplasma infections redistribute levels of a key enzyme needed in inhibitory neurons to generate GABA, a neurotransmitter released at the specialized connection between two neurons, called a synapse. Building on that discovery, the scientists revealed that persistent parasitic infection causes a loss of inhibitory synapses, and they also observed that cell bodies of neurons became ensheathed by other brain cells, microglia. These microglia appear to prevent inhibitory interneurons from signaling to the ensheathed neurons."

176157090,You are on 4mg risperidone right? Is that high for bipolar disorder? I am diagnosed bipolar and started taking 5 mg risperidone for loud voices that were constant. It’s too much. I’m glad I stopped at 5 and not the 6 he told me to take. 3 probably would have been enough. I figured for bipolar the dose was around 2.
176157091,Kratom would be blocked by my meds. I take an opioid blocker called naltrexone and kratom in turn would have zero effect on me. Before I started naltrexone I was taking kratom but I felt like I could only take it 1 times per day. I didn’t like that aspect of it otherwise I may still be taking it (excluding the fact that naltrexone has saved my life in many different ways than just addiction)…Kratom is very much like an opioid. Although its like marijuana in the idea it has different strains that produce different effects and its a natural pain reliever. Just giving u some background on kratom. Ive heard it could be helpful but also habit forming. Honestly I was turned off by the quick tolerance build-up with kratom. But I did find it to be enjoyable and maybe helpful with my mental health in some ways. Jungian analyst??

176157098,"I remember back in the eighties when I was living in transitional housing for a month when I was 27. It was a house that fit 5-6 of us who stayed there temporarily while we looked for housing. Some stuff happened there; I got ripped off, I fooled around with this woman there yada, yada, yada, I made a friend, I made an enemy (the same guy). This was the eighties, the golden age of porn and I used to rent porn videos from a nearby liquor store and everybody there would sit and watch them on the community VCR in the living room. The counselors had no idea we were doing this. Then one day all the counselors and the manager of the house had to go a meeting with all the other workers of the mental health agency. It was a luncheon and kind of a party/social thing. Unbeknowst to me, for entertainment they borrowed the VCR. Well, unfortunately, they set up the VCR and played it and I had accidentally left a porn movie inside it! Oh man, I couldn’t believe it. Now I can laugh about it but no one was laugh

Perfect example, I remember renting a video game as a child, but have long since lost the name of the game. The regret is I lost that game to time, the boon is I got a chance to have fun playing it in the first place.

I would get 20-30% in language classes and 100% in math classes. I think disproportional intelligence, like math vs language, is the earliest sign of sz."

174382299,I first got diagnosed with bipolar then with schizophrenia before my last two pdocs found that schizoaffective disorder is more accurate diagnosis because I have symptoms of schizophrenia as well as bipolar. With schizophrenia the mood disorder is not prevalent and long lasting and isn’t there for much of the time. With bipolar the psychosis symptoms only happen with mood episodes With schizoaffective the psychosis can happen with and without the mood disorder and vise versa. In my case I had prevalent mood symptoms and also times when my psychosis happened without the mood symptoms. So I have schizoaffective disorder

176157213,"Just thinking. My two best friends growing up were considered good looking by some girls. One of them had a girlfriend in 7th grade. The other one lost his virginity when he was 14. I knew him from 5th grade until a couple years after high school ended. I saw him turn out to be a guy who most girls really liked. I don’t know how he did it but to me he was the person I played with as a kid and we went out for sports and then got into partying. I have to admit, he amazed me a couple times with the girls he talked to who liked him. He fooled around with a few of the most popular girls in school who were real beauties. We were pretty equal except he got women and I didn’t. But I have thinking about this for a few months. I think back on my high school years and me and my friends hanging out on the streets every night with the neighborhood girls. We used to fool around with them a little. But I hung around them all that time and they rarely disrespected me. I mean we were out there playing football 
while the girls watched or later we all used to party. The girls certainly had no romantic feelings towards me but thinking back, I was accepted. And it wasn’t all because of who my friends were, I think they accepted me on my own merit. Kind of boosts my confidence to realize that. I’m not even close to being a ladies man, but my fantasy was always to be a player. I always thought that if the right girl liked me, I would “break through” and get into that exclusive club of being liked by women. Of course I’m 60 now and past my prime–by a lot. I talk to women at work or try to be friendly with cashiers. But that’s all it is, friendly talk. I mean I’ve gotten lucky with women years ago and I’m still friendly with a few women at work my age. It does boost my ego to think of some women who liked me and I liked a lot of them too. I’m just rambling and reminiscing about the old days."

You’ll find the views are even better in the bad weather. Most people go out for a pic when the weather is good. The best pics happen when it isn’t. It’s a worthwhile challenge.
176157216,Can you tell me about your experience?
176157217,I think it depends on the person and medication. I’m on the Invega Sustenna injection now and I don’t notice any side effects from it now but I always noticed side effects all the other times when I was taking pills.

I stopped the treatment and I left, over time from the language of the body and from how she posed, from what she said (you may not kn
ow it but many people who have little control of their flows and mental impulses unconsciously say between the lines that who really think especially when they are relaxed and feel powerful) I felt that something was wrong, but it took me some time to connect everything to a possible attack on my inches as a man. in those moments she denied my side effects and waited with ears for particular news. I thought it was something to do with the penis from how she behaved and laughed under her “mustache”. this after years I have understood. I never in life at the moment would have thought that there were drugs like that. over time and with doubt I thought about all my sessions and his suspicious behaviors and from my typical posthumous enlightenment I thought it was a decrease in the penis! that’s how I searched the web in my native language but found nothing. so that I thought I was wrong and for years I went on not thinking about it anymore. a few months ago it came back like a thunder and it was there that

And speaking of department stores I’ve worked in several. I mostly stocked shelves. It’s not that bad, you might have to get along with just a few people that you see every day and you know. I worked graveyard for 8 months stocking shelves at Target. No customers to deal with at that time. Incidently, I’ve been at jobs where I hardly spoke to anyone. I mean, I talked just enough to ask questions and learn directions but I was mute the rest of the time, lol.

The grass is always growing and the boss…the head groundsman who is volunteer as well is doing less as he’s getting older. With that and us playing more cricket on the turf pitch my hours at the club have doubled. Anyways. I’ve decided after the end of season next weekend I’m having a holiday. Not going anywhere. Not planning on doing anything other than relaxing, continuing with my exercise and eating healthy and just having time away for a couple of weeks. Like I deserve a little break and it’ll be nice to reset and just not have to go to the city a couple of days a week. So. Not you…but screw you’se I’m holidaying in true _PERSON_ style."

I agree, a lot of them are aggressive, and I’ve been threatened and chased by them. I just hate how they focus on the schizophrenia though. I’m not homeless, have schizophrenia, and have never chased anybody or threatened to stab them.

I’d imagine it’s hard to shaft you when your working as a disability person. I’ve found if you shout loudest when it comes down to it they can’t do too much… Still. That is a poor attitude from your supervisor and you are right to question that. Very poor but that is the work force these days.

176157339,I’m pregnant (due end of next month). What country are you in ? I’m in the UK and we have perinatal mental health services you can get refered to. They are very helpful. My pregnancy has been normal so far. Fortunately I didn’t have to come off my medication. I have sz and a heart leak. When you give birth they will want to monitor you In Hospital for a few days. This is because apparently on days 3-5 after giving birth your hormones plummet and it can cause a relapse. It is early days like you say. I’m 37 this month and this is my first baby. However many people in their 40’s have healthy babies and pregnancies. Good luck.
176157340,I’ve had a blocked nose since I was 13 or so. Soon after I became mentally ill. Both I still have. But I don’t see a connection. My mom had sinus problems too but she’s not mentally ill at all.
176157341,"No one specific. I was just doing things out of character. Going strange, sometimes dangerous places, just not being aware of how my presence affected other people and sometimes being unaware of my surroundings. I wasn’t doing these things all the time, but I got around. But just as serious was that before the eventual 8 month hospitalization, I was in a group home with serious, serious symptoms for a year. I was seriously, seriously ill and I was 20 years old but naïve in lots of ways and I wasn’t on medication. So the big city had interesting points to it but it was a strange environment for someone with a strange disease."
174382349,"Not sure where this is going, but I keep resurrecting to the year 2011. Maybe 2010 at the earliest once in a while (like very rarely). Sort of like reincarnation on steroids but I take a physics and scientific perspective. I’m of course a layman when it comes to these things. I haven’t ruled out cloning and I sort of lean toward that I’m a clone with either a reptilian consciousness, AI consciousness, or something involving time travel and consciousness transfer. You know different timelines or parallel universes something like many worlds theory but I lived it millions of times. Similar to quantum immortality but I’m trapped via a time bubble or paradox and then my soul was trapped for lack of a better word by aliens from their technology. I’m an alien abductee for reals… Then you got the whole dark sinister side of things where the people out there abuse that gift and power. Some call them Illuminati or whatnot. They go by other names and terms too. No need to elaborate or get into sp
ecifics. I just thought I’d share. I’m getting tired, upset, stressed, headaches, etc. from all this. I just want it to end. I cannot even ‘not exist’ for lack of a better word because I just loop back in time. I could end up a lot worse or some where else and then my folks would miss me. Aliens could punish me and then everything resets and I have to deal with life again from the very beginning. I feel my only motivation is hope: hope to learn; hope to gain an understanding of my gifts and limitations. I hope to understand more physics to maybe help me in the next ‘run’. God helps me a lot too. Thank you. I don’t think this is a delusion. I could be off by a factor of 5 or so, but I doubt it’s way off like people suppose. In a past life, I was told I was in a cloning program and I might be a immortal time traveler aka immortal ‘vampire’ lol…I retained these thoughts, memories, and stuff from previous incarnations and lives. I often think I’m in hell because of schizophrenia and my per
manent, severe disability and no means to support myself or take care of myself. It seems to be an eternal curse. I do regret over-sharing over the years, but I keep doing it (past lives included) due to ignorance, desperation, a need to help, and living in agony due to schizophrenia. I guess I just wanted help and a way out. The latest I remember waking up is 2013. I don’t know all the time travel technicalities or dynamics and such but I give analogies or metaphors like the movie ‘Groundhog Day’, ‘Edge of Tomorrow’, ‘Source Code’, ‘Matrix’, ‘Butterfly Effect’, ‘Travelers’ etc. just to give a few examples of what goes through my head. Thank you!"

I feel bad critiquing your work on here given that this not a songwriting forum. My main comments would be that the second line doesnt rhyme with the fourth, so maybe change the second line (as, the second line is kind of already said in the last line in the chrous) And the line about dancing doesnt seem to fit the same metre of the rest of first verse. Other than that it seems very well written and is very clearly speaking a kind and sincere message of hope. I can imagine it in a synthwave arrangement personally.

My problem is thinking people care and people have the intelligence and motivation to learn – even doctors and therapists. It’s hard to get on my level.

For example, I subscribed to Gaia TV for 12 bucks a month and learned more in a few days (high quality) than the past few years and it had a pleasant and calming feeling to me.

The problem is my fear-based reality and memories. I think it’s part of my personality and maybe my Aspergers that I find frustrating. That I expect people to be open and honest and respectful and forthcoming. I have a hard time building friendships, maintaining them, and keeping them. I prefer to be alone. I lost trust after I started getting recall in 2015 of my former friends and what I felt at the mental hospital. I have been wrong a lot. I have said and believed inaccurate things but I believe it’s part of the learning and remembering process. It
s not an exact science. I am human. But I would say about 50% of what I said was true which is crazy and also amazing somewhat. It’s pretty accurate. I got in the ball park. The problem is I’m not too privy on the time travel science but even most people aren’t – even the smartest people in history including _PERSON_. For the longest time I struggled how one can go back in time and remain on the same timeline. They must have perfected the time travel tech despite what people are saying if they can do 20 and backs and had _PERSON_’s time machine since the early 2000s. So there’s a way to go back or stay on the exact same timeline. I don’t think most people know and I still don’t fully understand. My limited knowledge of conceptual physics ( I don’t do equations or math obviously) like MWT tells me the universe constantly branches off. But there’s something off, like I’m in a time loop, simulation, or the universe bounces back but doesn’t change until 2015ish when it branches off globa
lly into two major components that I remember: two big events: One where _NAME_ one in 2016 and one (this reality) where _PERSON_ won in 2016. Something that keeps bothering me and I keep remembering and bringing up like it was Yesterday. I guess it’s _PERSON_ Effect but I was alive and lived those lives where she won and it was worse…I am so happy being here now. A lot of it is undetectable or possibly unknown. Like the Canadian TV Show “Travelers” where in the year 3000 human consciousness can be sent backwards in time into a clone or host body. Either this happened to me or I’m stuck in the year 2011 for eternity in Groundhog day Plus all the other crap that is going on. In this life, I believe I was cloned in 2011-2013 ish sometime. I dropped out of college in 2011. My story is sort of inconsistent, but I hope you give me some leaway as a damn clone with synthetic brain circuits, implanted memories of a life, and supressed memories from what I can gather. Either I’m super insane or I’m on th
e right track. I believe I’m on the right track. I heard and seen and experienced the Illuminati which is real to me. So there’s that. I guess there’s aliens and aliens run the simulation. Not sure how we can simulate an entire dang universe with other galaxies. It’s impossible for me to grasp and that’s my problem. I don’t give up and I persist. I have like an OCD-like personality. I guess you can say I’m a Milab SSP Super Soldier that was in Operation Greenstar in College + Monarch + Montauk + possibly project moonshadow. Project moonshadow is so crazy, I don’t believe I was inserted into my mothers womb by ETs or scientists as a embryo, genetically modified, and then taken at 2 or 6 years old. My earliest memories of being alive are 2013. Basically a test tube baby. My mom has no memories of this, but my uncle was almost abducted by ETs as a kid. He knew a guy who saw craft and aliens and photographed them but destroyed the photos. My grandfather and grandmother saw ufos all the time in was
hington state in the woods all the time coming in 3s I think. Silver discs. Cool stuff. One of my earliest memories was being in the Cabin in one of my lives and having communication with aliens (greys I think) as a kid. It was like telepathy from great distances. I believe I had missing time growing up as a kid in the car while my mom drove. Like I said, after I die in this life, I go back to 2013 and restart my life again exactly the same like the universe resets. Been doing it too many times. 2015 was a breaking point for me when “worlds collided” at the mental hospital. Luckily, I survived. When I used to go boating with my dad, I probably had some experiences too. Same thing in high school riding my bike with my friend. I just call them different lives or timelines. They can _USER_ID_ the simulation or timeline or my life. Literally I’m a puppet on a string, a very damaged one. The grey aliens are the ones that turned me into an Anunnaki and let me escape and run the simulation. They also are the o
nes that tortured me many, many times when I pissed them off. Ironically, they want me to believe in God. I guess there are good and bad ones just like good and bad people. So yes, while I do suffer from some stuff, I do believe I can get better and overcome 50-90% of my problems through research, time, and education, as well as coping mechanisms and skills. I cannot get help from real doctors or staff or my entire family or even friends. Hell, even the government can’t be truly trusted. I mean have you watched X files? I just post my thoughts on this website although I try to think before I post more often than not."

I think I have become a lot better with stress actually, that I’m not collapsing under this pressure (let’s hope it stays that way). I’m happy about that. I cleaned my living room and hall way today and packed it all into boxes and packed all that fit into my mums car. _PERSON_. People from church are a great help and family is loving."

174382365,"I’m sza and how it works for me is I have positive symptoms regardless of whether I’m in an episode or not. But when not in an episode they are very mild, infrequent and I can easily say they are just my psychosis and basically ignore them. Versus when I’m in an episode everything is intense and impossible to ignore so I become fixated and struggle with maintaining my insight. If you have bipolar with psychotic features or depression w psychotic features tho you should really only experience psychosis when having a mood episode and not outside of that."

174382370,Do you continue to have positive or negative symptoms? You haven’t given us much to go on in this post to ascribe a reason for things so I tend to go with the medical team diagnosing you. They probably have a better perspective then the single sentence given here.
176157429,"Yes, what _AT_MENTION_ says. Talk to yourself in your head. Reassure yourself. Calm yourself down. Think things through and realize that you are overreacting to ease your mind. Retrain your brain. Also 120 mg of Cymbalta helps lol."

176157436,"I agree that video porn is mostly awful and degrading towards women. But, if you find it too hard to quit entirely, you can always do what women have done for centuries and just turn to written erotica. Nobody is being degraded when all characters involved are fictional, and you can search only in categories you like. I had been stepping away from porn for a while, but I had to stop completely when the weird incest stuff took over. As a survivor of incest abuse, I found it very triggering and re-traumatizing. Written stuff is much nicer, and it is easier to filter out tags on things you don’t wish to read about."

My dad would have to drive her everywhere just like he has to drive me. He’s driving up to get her today. I already rescheduled my appointment but I can call back
176157442,In general most folks go back to being psychotic and spend some time in the Psych Ward after they do such a thing but maybe you were misdiagnosed or incredibly lucky and won’t have to do that.
176157443,"I’m coming up on my 3 year mark of taking Invega Sustena without being hospitalized. I have come close to a relapse and had to tweak my meds, but no hospitalizations. My goal and prayer is never to have to go to the psych ward again. How long have you been on Invega without a hospitalization/relapse?"
176157444,"On my bladder and kidneys. Well, that’s what the tech said but she didn’t elaborate. I know she took a lot more pics of my left kidney than of my right. I wonder if it’s stones. But the dr may disagree and say it’s normal. Techs aren’t trained in diagnosis."

You’re welcome to join because we’re trying to make ush into a bigger and better organization. _PERSON_ is nice, I made friends there by doing a vocational rehab program there at some point.

My friend _NAME_ is the facilitator. Right now we’re doing a boring class called Infinite Possibilities but most people have already taken that class so it’s mostly just talking.

174382384,"Some of the meds can reduce your IQ. One med I was given shut down part of my “self”, meaning, part of me was now gone, and any access to any memories of that part of me were gone as well, thus it was as though that part of me had never existed. It was not until I was taken off that drug did I suddenly become aware of what was missing. It was shocking to now realize just how much of my self had temporarily vanished. Sorry, but I can’t recall what specific medication that was since that was over 20 years ago. It was intense to such a degree that would be about the equivalent of losing all awareness of happiness and all prior memories of it. Thus you would also lose all memories of any prior occurrences of ever being happy, rather than just lose awareness of happiness itself."

176157488,"It is easy to prove that the whole sz condition is not genetic in root origin (ontologically)and that the mechanism of change and functional disorder at the level of cognitive processes and associated chemical background Does not occur according to the directions issued by a human gene(s) or even the human genome’s family ! NO active role for the human gene (s) in creation the sz condition or its symptoms The question: Why ? 1- the thing be called hallucination is considering both of the creation cause of the whole condition that you call it schizophrenia ,and the functional cause who producing all types of bad symptoms This means that,the hallucination is the maker of sz condition and its symptoms,and For many reasons it is impossible to find a casual relationship between what is a genetic and the things be called hallucination 2-the hallucination is not located inside the Neutron !! 3- the hallucination does not exist in a constant form inside any biological organ or brain region ! 4-In terms o
f the general and constant principle,the H is not located at all in the unconscious state,it follows that it does not active or behave functionally from within the unconscious state or within any neutron ! 5- The hallucination is located at the end of the receptors,and it has an opposite electric charge to the charges that exist from the terminal ends of the receptors,and this result in a state of attraction between the opposite charges (interference interactions) 6-There is no anything in our biological nature or our physical world similar to the hallucination Except the whole Psychological Self (psychic user) 7-the hallucination begins its functional activity (destructive) on the self-thoughts after realizing its implicit concept in the conscious mind theater,and hence,it does not participate or interfere with the functional path of the brain cells in the production processes of the self-thoughts -the cognitive cells perform their functions inside the neutron as USUAL 7- the hallucination is acts /behaves i
n the wakefulness period time (ONLY),and becomes absent existentially during the period of deep sleep / loss of consciousness,and therefore it is not functionally active all time of sleep ! The results; during the period of sleep,there is no sz or its symptoms and the balance state in its natural level ,and there is no any kind of the change,disorder or symptoms AT all Do you know the role of genetic functions which make the sz condition,symptoms ,changes or disorders disappear completely while the person in the state of deep sleep ? it is supposed that,in the case if the sz is genetic,this means that the change,disorder and symptoms must be occur during 24 hours ,and the chemical background in the state of imbalance during the wakefulness time or the deep sleep time !"

176157507,"I took Latuda for 2 years but ended up switching back to Perphenazine becuase of side effects. Its an older one, but its been the best med i’ve been on (less akathasia and sexual side effects, and its been weight neutral for me). I’m a dude though so it could be different for you. Puls I bet its cheaper without insurance than any of the newer meds."
176157508,Not in the least. It lets me perform at a job with a high cognitive load.

176157514,I had a parapsycoligist say that they had some one that heard voices and they ignored it and they went away
176157515,"Hmm, I dont know. Dont make any rash decisions dude."
176157516,I’d say that’s delusional reference
176157517,"Not sure about that. But i have a feeling it might be because i worked a lot in call center and listen to a lot and lots of metal music. If i stop listening to metal and take less calls, will i be able to recover."
176157518,"Mine stopped instantly, well after two weeks. But recently I thought I heard talking in the radio when it wasn’t on so I might be the same as you in that the last to go are the first to come back as in I get small scares like that.I will also hear inaudible voices when I’m stressed"
176157519,"I have recovered my sleep, and I am less stressed and anxious now. Today I will try to do all my chores in time to start work monday I still have a week left on my doctors note, but I think I can do it. And I need the money Do you think I should return to work Monday? Yes No 0 voters"
176157520,My husband will be home soon
174382405,I have negatives and I’m not on aps.
176157521,I am also putting lot of effort but no one has still come up to me and said I see u are putting lot of effort and one day I may reap benefits. Now it’s like no matter what I do it appears to me that people are taking it in a wrong way or I am being looked down.
176157522,Whoa. That’s too much ativan. You won’t even know where you are. Call an ambulance or something.
176157523,Amisulpride but i get weight gain and prolactine. I dont know what todo.
176157524,Sounds like your suffering from something more than simple anxiety. But you should really try to see a qualified psychiatrist about this. Good luck.

This stuff matters, I deleted my recent vid out of reservations. Maybe I could feel more accepted, I’m still learning about myself and am on so many chemicals."
176157527,When I had voices they would call me ugly and talk about me in voice of loved ones saying they never loved me etc I also heard gunshots and Moanes etc etc They tortured me 24/7 for years. I used to scream at them. My neighbors probably didn’t like that as I lived in a apartment. I tried ignoring them but mostly I think I screamed at them. I slapped myself sometimes and did other things too sometimes infront of people. My voices went away thankfully.
176157528,i googled it pornstars make around 60-120k not bad but top pornstar make 200k-300k wow.
176157529,"Hi Sardonic, I haven’t made it anywhere lately. My main issues are feeling nervous, waking up frequently at night, and the voices falling asleep or waking up. My dreams can be really vivid. I’ve been to two local medical hospitals and one psychatric hospital that offers walk in mental health assessments. My medical tests came back normal after following up with my PCP. They couldn’t find anything wrong and felt it was anxiety. The psychiatric hospital assessment came up with stress causing the issues. I sat through a 45 min to an hour assessment with them. They showed me ways to cope with stress and the referred me to counseling or crisis. I have some days that are better than others. My biggest concern are my sleep issues while trying to rest. Some have suggested even a sleep disorder. Hopefully I can get some answers or relief soon."
176157530,"I’m glad you know we’re here for you. Sorry things are going downhill, though. I think things are getting bad for a lot of us with the stress of the pandemic and the news cycle and change in routine that a lot of us are experiencing. I’m happy to hear from you, though."
174382411,What is nms? 15
176157531,Been on Olanzapine 20mg for last four years - no positive symptoms and very stable mood. Just got to deal with a few negatives but I’m not sure if it’s a core part of Sz or whether it’s the medications
176157532,i wont get tested

176157534,"Just to play ball with your husband, how about religious music? Songs that pass his approval. Or genres or artists. Music is pretty important."
176157535,"Yes. Like, I started reading this 980-pages book a few months back. I stopped at page 648 and I can’t muster the drive and focus needed to finish it ! Maybe it’s mental or emotional burnout. I really don’t know myself anymore. As a kid/teen, I was really careless and books were my favorite passtime. But since getting ill with sz everything changed."
176157536,"Sounds like you’re at an important stage in the illness. I hate the recovery model, but that’s not to say you can’t make progress. Everyones idea of what progress is for them differs. If you wanted to kick the ass of the negatives, I found forcing myself into eating three meals a day and exercising 4 days a week has made me feel so much better I take vitamins as well now. With these things I think it helps lift mood and you have gotta eat right and keep active if you can All these things help massively. Not just the meds, but lifestyle needs adjusting when able. Hope the feeling continues for you"
176157537,"Are you holding on to her, or the feeling that came with being with her?"
176157538,_AT_MENTION_ there’s quite a few reasons. Things have sort of been slowly getting worse at my office and I got written up last Tuesday for having a panic attack at work. We have two doctors three of the four days now and the days are really like 11 hour days. I’m lucky if I get half of my lunch I’m supposed to because we are constantly behind. I’m so exhausted every night after work all I can do is get in bed and sleep. And the weekends I spend recouping. I just think perhaps a slower paced office would better suit me. Or one with more assistants possibly that can manage a busy stacked schedule like that

176157545,"I had a small party for my friends. The dessert was a chocolate pudding with sauce of red berries. I served it, arranged like a turd / ???? with the sauce of red berries looking like blood and called the dish for “bloody stools”… One of the guest couldn’t eat it. I know it’s immature, childish, but it was a lot of fun and it tasted very good."
174382410,"You need to look at where the drug acts, presynaptic or postsynaptic. They can’t be agonists and antagonists postsynaptically for example."
176157546,"Have you tried being off them before? I have three months off meds, first try post-psychosis. I did it with the approval of my nurse practitioner and have people in place to reality test with if it looks like I’m developing symptoms. I had a scary week last week as a few people thought I was becoming symptomatic again but it appears that it was residual thinking from when I was psychotic and legitimate anger about some of what I’ve been through. I have been really happy being off medications and don’t know if I would be willing to get back on them again – maybe for short time. I wasn’t aware how much they blunted me (I was on an AP for a year) until I got off and started thinking quicker/clear, almost seeing better, and having a lot more feelings. I’m sorry; I know it’s a difficult situation. I’m sure there has to be options though. Quality of life really matters."
176157547,_AT_MENTION_. Are you taking your meds. You’re all over the place. I can’t figure out what you’re talking about. Your parents are kicking you out bc of your weight? Really?
176157548,I often run into the problem of thinking my parents are talking about me. But only during a paranoia attack.
176157549,Yesssss _AT_MENTION_ “the universe” lmaoo
174382416,"Good point. I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks. Your comment made me realize my madness resulted in everything I valued in life being washed away by schizophrenia - marriage, relationship with my kids, business, money, yacht, home, relationship with my community… Pretty much everything. Since treatment I’ve been rebuilding and I’m very happily married now. I suppose me going mad again would destroy my marriage. I definitely don’t want that!"
176157550,"Yeah. However, I sometimes think of my mom’s guilt because she gave me the gene with my dad. She always feels really bad about it. I know that she thinks a lot about it. Yet she still yells at me for advocating. I’m just confused about this. I’m sorry to hear about your disability. It’s so hard to have sz and a physical disability."

176157552,i did my chore today… every saturday i have to vacuum the upper floor… and i been doing that for a while now and my mum likes that i do it. I always not look forward to it but then when i’m doing it it’s ok. Besides that i watched movie (die hard 4.0) with dad and then an episode of the 100. Just had din dins now which was nice and now i’m listening music and browsing the forum
176157553,"_AT_MENTION_,_AT_MENTION_, apparently I’m just a jealous old spinster. I’ll back down."
176157554,"I for most of this decade have had similar experiences to many of the accounts upon this very forum ( and others) and have also come across the explanation of Gangstalking N.L.P and RNM along with the noticeable organized harassment/unusual disruption within in my daily routine, I have been in contact with people calling them selfs TI’s though it’s been a learning curve full of Youtube groomers, phishing e-mails and mousetrap forums looking at discrediting or all-out trolling using bait & switch tactics. Though the uncanniness of the explanations remains true, so what do you guys think of the whole targeted individual movement when trying to cope with what’s happening to some of us in real life."

176157561,If so how did it go?
176157562,What about entropy? anyone know anything about that? Is that related to this? Order to disorder. A hamburger seems more ordered than a pile of ???? lol.
174382415,That’s a very sad article.
176157563,I think about fishing
176157564,I only remember the best and worst parts. It went on from about February to October. And then the residual psychosis continued until about December. This was my first ‘episode’
176157565,Hey there _AT_MENTION_ I feel very similar to you. I find my attention span isn’t great. I can’t play for hours and hours every day like I used to be able to (even a few years ago). But a couple of times a week I can play games for a few hours. You might find different games suit different moods too. Like some less intense games are easier to pick up. So diversify what you are playing is my advice. But also it is fairly common I’m afraid.
176157566,"Hmm… my ex gf cheated on me too. I left her. Guess what, I found a girl who loathes cheating with all her heart. And we trust each other. I think you need to have a talk with your husband and let him know that his jealousy and insecurity offend you."
174382417,"In my usual habit of trying to find the good in whatever I can, this is my take: Therefore, they caution that “while starting ‘treatment as usual’ earlier may not halt the disease process, comprehensive and sustained care has been shown to improve overall mental health for those with schizophrenia.” Early intervention isn’t usually just getting someone a prescription fast - it’s a complete program. And that complete program is still shown to be useful. You could even view it positively in that probably even people who have been ill for a very long time could potentially benefit."
176157567,Good luck hope you feel better.
176157568,how do you de-stress
176157569,Almost same like me same timing instead I go to bed at 10
176157570,I think you can always learn new things but it may be harder.
176157571,"Okay cool! Glad it works for you, hope it works for me as well _AT_MENTION_"
176157572,"It is a tricky balance. We can’t control the behavior of others. We can only control our own behavior. But we also need some kind of social support because humans developed as social creatures. We need love and support to thrive, and it is horrible to tell a person without those things that they just need to stop missing them. We evolved to need those things. A lack of love and support causes the brain to grow in a different way, and can cause all kinds of problems with the production of hormones/neurotransmitters, the ability to make and store memories, the ability to learn patterns, etc. Physical skin-to-skin contact is so important to our development that babies born in the NICU have scheduled times and special protocols for being held/touched. Otherwise, they develop all kinds of developmental disabilities."
176157573,I use to be begsy
176157574,It’s not too late…
176157575,I completely understand what you are saying. May I ask how you started to feel better?
176157576,maybe you think its a simulation because you are really being watched by other beings…do you feel like your being watched.?
176157577,"I feel that sz made me wild, savage and grumpy."

176157579,I’m going to make myself go for my walk around the neighborhood tomorrow. I always feel better after.
176157580,Do you have an iPhone?
176157581,didn’t ask me if I wanted to go or if I needed anything. I think that was rude.
176157582,What about other drugs?
176157583,I’ve been trying to focus on doing math lol
176157584,Yes I slept well. How are you this am?
176157585,"I do this a lot. I’m not proud of it but I’m very quick to judge someone as the kind of person the world would be better off without. My thoughts never go to hurting anyone but there’s some people I just wish would die a random painless death that would rid the world of having to deal with the way they hurt others. I don’t like that I see things this way and have a very black and white sense of morality but it’s how I’ve been the past few years. I’ve just become very angry since my diagnosis and when I see someone I assume has it easier than I do despite being a worse person than I am I wish they wouldn’t be around to be happy while continuing to be a terrible person. Aside from what I just explained, I do wish death on my abuser. I don’t want to get into what he did to me and my mother but what hurts me the most is I sometimes think I wouldn’t be as mentally ill and depressed as I am today if he had never come into my life. I wouldn’t have lost my ability to trust others, my 
relationship with my mother would be better and I often wonder if I’d ever had started hearing voices at all. I know he hurt other people before us too, including his own children. I feel no shame in saying I wish the worst for him. Sorry for this overly long response. Your question was very thought provoking for me."
174382413,"Yeah, I tried to flag my own posts because I realized it’s a triggering subject."
176157586,"For the past few days, I have been having problems with what I call “mouth hunger,” where I’m not really physically hungry, but I feel like binging. I have so far been successful in staying in my calorie range and not going over 1400. But I really want to eat a lot of something fattening! I’ve worked way too hard to mess it up now. I definitely am eating enough so I don’t know why I am having these cravings. I have taken to eating 100 calories of raw veggies as a mid-afternoon snack and that helps. I eat 2 cups of cauliflower, 2 baby cucumbers with peels, and 12 grape tomatoes. It’s crunchy goodness! I love the crunching part. It takes the edge off the need to binge since it’s a nice big bowl of veggies. I just can’t helping wanting something so-called BAD. I guess this too shall pass…anyone else struggling with good eating?"
176157587,Call an ambulance. Say you need to go to a pychiatric hospital.
176157588,Yes have been there i think
176157589,"Can someone help me understand Medicare? What are my options with add on plans? Are they worth it? Do I need to pay separately for all the different parts? How do I know what I have now? In Oregon the hospitals are all their own networks, don’t remember what it’s called. CCO? Anyways, I’m about to move back to _NAME_ and will have to drop my Providence advantage plan. But I don’t know how any of this works and don’t know if I should look for another advantage plan? Or whatever the other option is? Or just not get any add on plan? Can someone help explain these things to me? I’ve tried googling, but I’m getting information overload and none of it is making any sense to me."
176157590,Yes I did. Then while inpatient I was having major chest pains & had to discharge AMA. It was ridiculous. They would not let me go to regular hospital and come back. It’s ok cause I see my clinic on Tuesday
176157591,I even called 911 and told them that I am Jesus and that they should protect me and praise me lol I was so sure of being the king of the world and that I will bring heaven to earth.
176157592,"Hello, my p-doc said I need to add _PERSON_ together with my olanzapine, in order to control my weight gain. I’ve been taken both at night for about 20 days. I find myself wake up in the early morning say 3am-4am and can’t get back to sleep again. Do you people have similar experience with the dual p-meds together? Does the insomonia caused by _PERSON_? I don’t have sleep problem when I take olanzapine alone. Thank you!"
174382418,"Why is abilify right at the bottom, _AT_MENTION_?"
174382419,I’m on abilify. My cognitive symptoms aren’t so bad. I’m able to read and play board games and table top games.
176157593,I hear you there! Why not try an hour a week?
176157594,"that actually reminds me of new zealand, have you ever been there or wanted to travel there?"
176157595,"yes, I think it is, it says full drill but when I zoom in on the pic it doesn’t appear to be full drill"
174382414,Olanzapine or Abilify could possibly help you. Talk to your doctor about it
176157596,Latuda seems like a good med which give people energy and weight neutral. How long have you been on it?
176157597,It’s called _NAME_. I may have spelled it wrong. It happens to every body. I still get it sometimes and I experienced it before I got sick also. It’s when you get that feeling you’ve been somewhere or have seen something before. Maybe in a vision or in a dream. It’s normal.
176157598,"I tried yogi mood teabags, but only helped for the first time. This bulk hibiscus is potent stuff when you leave it in the cup longer"
176157599,"Yeah, I’ve read your stories. You understand. We’re lucky we were able to quit."
176157600,Thanks MrSquirrel.
176157601,"I would call that particular situation other things, but not the product of mental illness, per say."
176157602,I would think there is places you can do part time. My degree is supposed to take max 8 years but I got an extension because of my illness. Everyone there was so kind to me after my psychotic break. They were actually relieved to have a reason why I was acting so strangely.
176157603,You go my foliage friend! I hope you enjoy.
174382421,_PERSON_. I restart tomorrow. Abilify gave me anger

176157608,"Packing up and going to live somewhere remote by myself. Or giving up on everything and driving out of town as far as I can go. Or swerving into the oncoming lane while driving. Or injuring myself often in a specific way. I actually did two of those things before medication. The thoughts went away on high doses, but as the dosage came down the thoughts came back. I haven’t acted anything out since though. I don’t think I think things through in pictures well generally, so that might be why I don’t get the images."
176157609,Yes I can to an extent all I know is I don’t want to become reliant on that drink so that’s why I try not to drink it.
176157610,"_PERSON_, you know as well as I do that peopl e post hurtful things, then try to make it like they are the victim by making big posts about leaving to get pity.

The only downside is that anti-depressants tend to swing me into mania. I just have to hope I can stay stable. Thanks for all the encouraging words y’all. They are appreciated."
176157613,Im not much for supplements thanks anyway.

176157620,yeah I had some. always when I was about to rub one off. it’s stopped now for years. don’t know what to do about it. just try to ignore it.

176157622,"Nothing really terrible has happened to me on a bus. The biggest pain in the ass about it is co-ordinating when it’s coming to a specific bus stop and co-ordinating if you have to transfer to another bus along the way. I took the bus from 1990-1995. You want to get to the bus stop just early enough so you don’t miss it but not so early that you’re sitting on an uncomfortable bench for 10 or 15 minutes waiting. I kind of prided myself on my bus taking skills, lol. I used to catch the bus almost every day. LIke I said, nothing really bad ever happened. It sucked when a bus would pull up to where I was waiting but be so full that it had no more room and I would have to wait for the next one to come along. That happened more in the big city I was living in. It also kind of sucked when it was standing room only, again, that happen a lot when I was living in a big city. IDK, just plan ahead (you probably already caught it!). Know exactly when to be at the bus stop."

174382427,"I wouldnt say its your fault, its schizophrenia. The only thing that is your responsibility (mainly) is your recovery, i think the rest will follow. Im alone too and dont really answer my phone for the same reason as you. What i said above is my own theory, first recovery, friends later."
176157627,Fruits are plants.
176157628,"The voices say why i haven’t killed myself on that night in 1988 when we adviced you. Finally i speak up and ask why didn’t they kill me when they are all so powerful ? Anyway, that was before i got diagnosed. I don’t know what would have happened obeying the voices."
176157629,If you fail school your life will be a lot crappier in most cases than if you don’t. Those things happen to dropouts.
176157630,"I hear whispers, and I can make out one word, usually my nickname, gets through"
176157631,"It helps to do research ahead of time. Know what people in your area are typically getting paid for the job you want. Know how much competition you have. Know what you have to offer that other, cheaper candidates do not."
176157632,Why would anyone flag this post? you didn’t really say much. I had a house in my 20’s where I had some really crappy neighbors. It ended up in punches and police being called. Your best bet is polite disagreements or trying to ignore them altogether. Getting in all out wars doesn’t usually go well for anybody.
174382428,"Well I believe I was just as responsible for my delusions as my alcoholism. It’s a personal choice but cmon, everybody. I mean pretty much everybody. Used/uses chemicals to balance their life. Only about 20% of people who try drugs get addicted. Same number as alcoholism. It’s really insensible to blame a user for that first drink they ever picked up. Sure hold them accountable and realize they gotta change. But nobody and I mean nobody wakes up one day and says “oh wouldn’t it be nice to be an alcoholic or an addict”. People don’t actually self stigmatize themselves rather it is a disease just as schizophrenia is. (Not completely sure why ones called a disease and the other an illness) For me I’d say my addiction was more beneficial than my delusions Delusions were simply an escape. An excuse. A lie in my mind. Thing is addiction fits all those categories too. But I think it serves a greater purpose than delusions. Addiction to me, and maybe it’s because I was sza Before I ever too
k a drug. But addiction actually had a purpose BEYOND escapism and masking feelings of reality. Like I said it does that as well, but the self medication is more than an escape. I self medicated anxiety a lot. And trying to rid yourself of anxiety is a more purposeful thing than having a delusion in my opinion. Now I’m on naltrexone for 5 years. So don’t have much addiction issues on this med. but drugs, illegal ones, albeit more harmful than legal ones for szs typically. Essentially served a similar purpose to me. Not suggesting anyone who’s against meds to try illicit drugs now, that’ll lead you down a daaaaark path."
176157633,"In my case, negatives and cognitives made my sz severe. Now I only have positives, I feel lucky. Negatives are the worst thing"
176157634,Hopefully you’ll recover… And not need to go back on meds…!!! How amazing would that be… I plan to do the same thing… At some point… Just stay healthy and you’ll be OK…
176157635,I should go outside
176157636,"Somebody? I still find, that this Zyprexa, puts me some dark thoughts after it take. This kind of apocalyptic thinking too besides the low energy… So I should accept this side effect? The other aps were even worse… As I said, maybe, once my brain is more awaken, i’ll feel less this smashing effect. Its not nice, it steals some hours in the day …"
176157637,About 3 months in I just liked everyone near me. I got a few messages but it didn’t go anywhere
176157638,I have never eaten pumpkin before. This looks really nice! You certainly have some skill in cooking to make that.
176157639,"Calcium and magnesium. Really good. Sleep agents. The CL. Also. Controls blood sugar. However, when taking CL supplements. You can,t drink milk. However, it depends on a person’s stress level, CL is also a natural. Tranquiilizer. Wikipedia that."
176157640,_PERSON_ why did you change your profile pic?
176157641,"I feel it is hard to get off meds without a rebound psychosis, after being on them long-term. I think it needs a careful plan and even then, you need luck to succeed. I think it can be worth a try though, especially after just one episode. Managed to slowly withdraw to a minimal dose, but i am still less stable than before meds. Im not sure if i ever dare take this last step from 0.5mg to zero. Maybe if i stay well the next half year."
176157642,"i am over 300 lbs now, i was 180 before i went back on olanzapine and probably under 160 before any meds at all. i tell myself i am going to start exercising and eating healthy but i end up only doing it one or two days then back to doing nothing, ive accepted this as just the way things are now as the meds i dont gain weight on i end up going nuts. last time i talked to my pdoc they asked if id be willing to switch to latuda. i was unsure because i really went nuts on geodon and idk if there similar"
176157643,Love it! That’s a great gift
176157644,I never saw it but I heard of it.
176157645,I’m good at maths
176157646,I’m sorry you’re having such a rough time _AT_MENTION_. It’s good that you’re seeing your pdoc tomorrow. Please let your pdoc know exactly how you’re feeling and the thoughts you’re having. Sending you hugs.
176157647,I spoke to my CPN a week ago on the phone. We arranged for me to get my depot done at the health centre. We also said we would meet today at 12:30pm Anyway 12:30 comes and goes so I phone the nurses office. My named nurse picks up and proceeds to tell me we need to sort getting my depot done and did I want to meet up on Friday. I was kinda thrown. I thought we had had this exact conversation a few days ago. I felt too awkward to say ‘hey haven’t we already had this conversation?’
176157648,"Wow, that is gorgeous!!"
176157649,Don’t take Klonopin without telling your new Dr. You might get addicted and then cant get more as you dont have a new prescription.
174382439,I read that as ‘fart powder’! Thought - I gotta get me some of that stuff lol
176157650,I followed my psychologists advice on what to do to avoid stressful situations and it led to a massive fall out and my conduct being questioned
176157651,"That was true prior to my breakdown and ultimately caused my psychosis. Now, I schedule myself so I know that I am in good hands with myself. I’m also in a home and that deals with a lot of details."
176157652,are there any in the uk or oz
176157653,See if you can click on _AT_MENTION_. A pop up box will give you the choice to message him.
176157654,"It does get better on some Antidepressants while you stay longer on them, especially SSRI. APs are the main culprit and requires to chnge them to find the right one, otherwise you stuck with it. Some people claim wellbutrin helps them. Our sexual dysfunction is not organic, like blood vessels narrowing and so on, thats why cialis is useless, its the neurological problem."
176157655,"Hi, welcome. It’s all about function. Most people hit the mental health system with psychosis but symptoms that interfere with your function should be looked at. You need to discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Early intervention with the appropriate medications leads to better outcomes so get in touch with your doctor."
176157656,My paternal grandfather and a paternal gt uncle had depression.
176157657,That happens to me on android too. It doesn’t happen very often though. No idea why.
176157658,I am so sorry 1234
176157659,"I don’t have any symptoms now, used to have paranoia"
174382435,"I think that’s one of the worse concepts to use on a schizophrenic. Its kinda not funny, cause if they really do or even just think that it will work…they have no idea what they can cause or make things a bit difficult for some. I think its more security for themselves than for the schizophrenics. I personally would WANT to know who is watching me, don’t do it from a distance…then my psychiatrist would ask if im experiencing hallucinations. I really hope their not that ignorant…"
176157660,What is CBD cbg ?
176157661,"Lol, love that song for a while now. I like the neuroticfish techno cover."
176157662,Can you call your doctor’s clinic tomorrow ?
176157663,Survived orientayion. Got my errands done. Quality time with hubby.
176157664,"Probably staying on medication is the best idea. I’ve seen too many people go off when they are feeling better and figure they don’t need med anymore when the meds are the reason they are feeling stable. The majority relapse because of this. Probably the best idea is not to get involved in drugs or drinking either. Period. From personal experience, it is extremely important to take care of your health. Your health when you’re younger will determine a lot about your health in the future and will effect your quality of life as you age. Take care of yourself because as you get older it gets harder and harder to lose weight and easier and easier to gain. Most people take their health for granted until they don’t have it anymore. I don’t spend a lot of time comparing myself to so-called “normies”. I’m satisfied most of the time with what I’ve accomplished myself and my family gives me enough positive and encouraging words on how well I’ve done. IDK, just the basics like eating right, 
getting enough sleep, exercising. Just common sense things like these are important. Human contact is right up there in importance as you age. Our instincts as schizophrenics tell us to isolate and avoid people but having a support system as you age can work wonders. Family, a good psychiatrist, neighbors, a friend, even cashiers at a store you regularly go to or whoever else you can think of. People are social animals and just having a comfortable interaction at some points in the day is therapeutic. Personally, I have worked almost my whole life. It is due to a few things: Hard work, lots of help and lots of luck. I put in the groundwork for those things. I did a lot of stuff when I was younger that I didn’t like or even hated. But it helped me in the long run. So I attended the vocational programs, I saw all the therapists and psychiatrists, I lived for years in the group homes, I dutifully went to family group therapy, I did the volunteer jobs, I went to day treatment. I didn’t like a lot about them b
ut looking back I can see they helped. Sorry for rambling. But you asked, lol. As to marriage, no I’ve never been married or had kids. I adopted the AA philosophy. Marriage and kids was not in the cards for me but I still have had married friends who have kids and so I can hang around them and enjoy being around good families and socializing with them without the responsibility of working on a marriage myself or having all the responsibility of raising my own family. Anyways, I hoped this helped in some way. Have a good rest of the day."
176157665,There are some things that we cannot control. Accept it.
176157666,I used to get that. Now I just once in a while get a gut feeling about things that will happen in the future.
174382432,My psychiatrist said “it ascerbates the timing of when you get schizophrenia a little earlier than if you didn’t do the LSD. but doesn’t cause schizophrenia”. I was worried because I tripped a lot in high school years…
176157667,It basically just makes sense if you are asexual.
176157668,_AT_MENTION_ Thank you !!
176157669,"Isolation doesnt help i know how u feel its not nice. Peace of mind is all i want but mind racing all the time it sucks. Wish i had some good advice but i dont, just know your not alone"
174382442,"If you want to immigrate to Canada, you may not meet the excessive demand requirement because schizophrenia can be seen as a “burden to Canadian medical system”. Meaning, I have a high chance of refusal. Meaning, I’m not wanted anywhere. The entire country hates me, I guess. I don’t know."
174382440,_AT_MENTION_ yes ;( buddy
174382445,Sigh. There’s nothing like negative symptoms to make you miss positive symptoms
176157670,"Sure, she got better with time But there were victims in her path Like _NAME_ who killed hundreds of Christians Before becoming _NAME_, one of the greatest of disciples. God will pick up the souls of the victims. Do not concern yourself with them. They did not die in vain. And they will be back to continue their work beside you."
174382443,_AT_MENTION_ i am less religious too on meds. I thought this was because of meds but i wasn’t sure.
176157671,I’m totally ok with taking medication until the end of my life. I have to do that for my physical disability anyways.
176157672,"I can have them and tell myself that is crazy, but then I go back to what if, and my mind races with false thoughts"
174382446,My doc is being ridiculous because she doesn’t realize that there is other meds than abilify and clozapine Abilify so far hasn’t done anything to my delusion and it has been over 4 months being on the shot…
176157674,"depression and needing antidepressants aside, mood has a lot to do with attitude They say if someone with low mood has won the lottery it takes less than a year to return to low mood The same for adversity in someone who is generally positive and happy I think attitude can be learned but perhaps it’s something born with Personal circumstances can also change mood though like with severe long term illness in a loved one. That’s challenging"
176157675,In some ways but Unfortunately it now is getting easier even in unusual situations
174382441,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Olanzapine-induced liver injury in mice: aggravation by high-fat diet and protection with sulforaphane. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of nutritional biochemistry, Apr 2020 08 Olanzapine is effective to treat for schizophrenia and other mood disorders, but limited by side effects such as weight gain, dyslipidemia, and liver injury. Obesity in the US is at epidemic levels, and is a significant risk factor for drug-induced liver injury. Obesity incidence in the psychiatric population is even higher than in the US population as a whole. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that obesity worsens olanzapine-induced hepatic injury, and to investigate the potential protective effects of sulforaphane. 8-week old female C57BL/6 mice were fed either a high-fat or low-fat control diet (HFD and LFD). Mice also received either olanzapine (8 mg/kg/d) or vehicle by osmotic minipump for 4 weeks. A subset of mice in the HFD?+?olanzapine group 
was administered sulforaphane, a prototypical Nrf2 inducer (90 mg/kg/d). Olanzapine alone increased body weight, without a commensurate increase in food consumption. Olanzapine also caused hepatic steatosis and injury. Combining olanzapine and HFD caused further dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Liver damage from concurrent HFD and olanzapine was worse than liver damage from high-fat diet or olanzapine alone. Sulforaphane alleviated many metabolic side effects of olanzapine and HFD. Taken together, these data show that olanzapine dysregulates glucose and lipid metabolism and exacerbates hepatic changes caused by eating a HFD. Activation of the intrinsic antioxidant defense pathway with sulforaphane can partially prevent these effects of olanzapine and may represent a useful strategy to protect against liver injury."
176157676,I like it. I ask them to walk me through the 54321 mindfulness exercise. Idk why but it really helps. Especially when all my friends are asleep and I have no one else to talk to.
176157677,"Full disclosure, I am a librarian out to recruit users, mwahahaha."
176157678,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ , there’s more to it then just a 9 month trial work period. There’s also a 14 month work period so that you can work in addition to the initial 9 months. I have to admit I’m a little rusty on my knowledge of SSDI. But basically I’ve been working for years and years and I still collect SSDI. After all these years of going on and off of SSDI and following their rules, my status with them is that I can earn up to about $1200 a month and still collect disability. But if I go over even once, I’ll lose my benefits. I really don’t know all the rules but this is my experience."
176157679,"I’m working after 3 years of not working. It’s only a part time shop job, but I’m finding it a real struggle to be honest. Been doing it about 5 months now. Hope it gets easier."
176157680,"I thought the whole picture of my past would have been very useful, as going from a car crash life to responsible and somewhat productive existence over a period of many years. As far as I am concerned, there needs to be more work done by the NMC and the University if I am to commit to such a path. Shame, I felt I had some valuable insight to offer that would actually help other people."
176157681,"It should be same as lowering risperidone, it comes with a bit of anxiety and feeling lethargy, thats just the withdrawal which lasts four weeks tops. After that your cognition improves as does your mood"
174382449,Does anyone knows about is noni natura ? and if you know how much is effective against schizophrenia ?
174382448,"Not really much for me. More of a case that it gave me back the mental energy I was expending on controling the positive symptoms, which are now in remission. That helped."
174382450,"I think there will be better treatments in the future. So although it worries me, there’s no use in letting fear control your life."
176157682,"Yeah, I saw that. It says it helps certain people but it hurts other people."
176157683,I track every single thing I drink and eat on MyFitnessPal. It really helps a lot
176157685,Buy an inexpensive tablet like an Amazon Fire tablet(?)
176157686,Yeah. Maybe it’s the meds but I only bleed for like 3 days and that’s it. I mean it’s still a heavy bleed the first two days but my periods now only last a few days.
176157687,"Well, you know, I have friends and family looking out for my welfare, but, in the end, it is me who keeps me safe."

176157694,Good luck _AT_MENTION_-Cotton You have a positive attitude!
176157695,I was scheduled to work until 4:00 today but the boss let me go at 1:30. It rarely happens but it was a nice surprise. I think a celebratory soda would not be out of line here.
176157696,Yes I heard through noises like the sound of the fridge
176157697,Why not take a break from dating and do something you enjoy ! Like a hobby. I was surfing nolongerlonely.com but then I started taking classes online so I don’t even care r n. I swear the older you get the less important it is to have a partner. For me that’s a good place to be.
176157698,I am proud that I am disconnected from how I used to be. I’d take being sz over being a drug addict any day.
176157699,"So glad for you, keep us updated please"
176157700,I’m really sorry you are going through this. I don’t know what to say. Just stay strong and I hope you get relief soon.

176157707,I’m not at all offended by the term “schitzo”. Why are the powers that be making a fuss about it?
176157708,Have you asked her about this? Is there any way you could be wrong and you’re torturing yourself for nothing? There’s lots of reasons why a baby could be sick. I was a planned pregnancy and I was sick. They thought I had leukemia for awhile because of my white blood cell count and I had chronic ear infections. Lots of babies are sick a lot. Very common. Babies don’t have a built up immune system and are susceptible to many diseases. From colic to SIDS to everything in between.

176157710,"I love Clozapine. It has made a big difference to me. I do take Ziprasidone as well, but this combination works well for me."
176157711,Maybe try drinking something easier on your system. Sounds like you drank hard liquor. I can’t drink it anymore. Wine and champagne don’t seem to bother me as much.
176157712,"If you change the molecular structure of methamphetamine or cocaine so it slips by the schedule 1 drug restrictions and then give it to toddlers, you sort deserve a ?????? up society and maybe mushroom clouds?

Great way to extract taxes from already bottomed out working class or indebted college students! Pure Nazi Ideology! Couldn’t have been operation papered clipped any better!"
176157713,what did that have to be for real? i think one of the abilifys has to be aristada probably but i don’t know which one is wrong…
176157714,That’s kind of a strange thing to say.
176157715,_AT_MENTION_ I was drinking a bottle of wine every night. I gained a lot of weight and didn’t look healthy. It seemed to be helping me too. But I don’t drink now cause I’m pregnant. I will never go back to a bottle of wine a night. After I’ve given birth I might just have one bottle of wine over a weekend.
174382453,Thanks for that

176157718,You’re thinking right _AT_MENTION_ .
176157719,Walk or bicycle
174382455,I was suicidal from my delusions and not from depression. I never had any other mental illness than schizophrenia.
174382457,"I have been limiting my calories to 1200-1400 per day since I started Zyprexa in mid-March. That should mean losing two pounds per week, but sometimes I only lose half a pound. I figure it’s the Zyprexa fighting me, but I am fighting harder. Overall, I have lost 27 pounds since starting it. I’m happy that at least it is going down, even if it’s not as fast as I would like. At least I am not gaining! One food I eat three or four times a week is Morningstar Farms Black Bean Burgers. They are 110 calories, 4.5g fat, 13g carbs, and 9g protein. Put them on two slices of Wonder Bread, and they are only 250 calories total. They fill me up and I really like them. Morningstar Farms makes lots of vegetarian products, but the black bean burgers are my favorites. They’re not expensive either. I pay $7.99 for a package of eight burgers, so $1 each. Beats what you pay when eating out! I am not vegetarian, but I do like things like Morningstar Farms and _NAME_’s frozen meals."
176157720,I just “graduated” to seeing my pdoc once every three months instead of once every two. I don’t have a therapist.
176157721,I have a morning suggestion: raisin bran. Also basil helps.
176157722,I don’t think it has anything to do with that. We were just sick.
174382459,i read a post that said “what causes people to get sick from schizophrenia?” and i got schizophrenia lol
176157723,"Loxapine doesn’t cause much hunger, or abilify, or risperidal. I haven’t tried the newest ones. They may have stopped making ap meds that cause hunger. It really was terrible for me for over a decade!"
176157724,Single life or married with kids are both hard in different ways. I don’t remember doing much choosing in my 20s and 30s. After 40 I got kind of used to being on my own.
176157725,"Fine then. Let’s start with what I don’t eat. No soda, no pizza, no bread for months for me. I’ve gained weight from stress eating carbage during the initial phases of the pandemic. The so-called quarantine 15lb. Lost ten lb since stopping most carbs."
174382460,I’d say that stopping using schizophrenia as an excuse not to do anything or for being violent. Take responsibility for yourself and your actions because the only person who can do anything about our predicament is ourselves.

176157733,I didn’t test but pretty sure I have it. Both my parents tested positive and I live with them. I got sick like 5 days after they got sick.
174382471,"_PERSON_ that’s true too. Truth is that the picture they have of schizophrenia is from the news and movies which show them as criminals. Last week a schizophrenic near my city killed 2 ppl and injured 7 with a _USER_ID_ sword Halloween night, he was disguised as a white ghost with long hair covering his face, I saw the video, it was too scary to watch, I just watched a few seconds. It was all over the medias."

I still had a conversation with her and figured out I had hallucinated a whole bunch of other crazy stuff. It all seemed real to me. It’s a crazy but long story. No telling how many times I did it and didn’t know. I see people and they talk to me. I can hear them and I talk back. If I see strangers in my house I go check my pill box.

176157872,Someone thought I did something to their child but in my thoughts but still it is pretty terrible. I have people in my mind a lot. I should go to the hospital or live by myself.

It helped me when first on it years ago with activity level problems but has pooped out for a long time now. My Pdoc has doubled my dose to 200 daily split between morning and lunch. Did anyone take this? Dose? Did it stop working? How did it help? It woke me up a bit and gave me more energy and in motion to do things. How long to get some relief? For me it was quick to work last time but didn’t exactly last forever maybe a year. Just looking for a bit o perspective for hope here. If not, ECT next, maybe even gonna get it anyway. F@*& this."

174382510,I saw the pdoc today. He’s on board with stopping the Lithium. It’s probably been making my psoriasis worse and has been causing or contributing to my tremors. He’s also on board with changing my main antipsychotic. Aristada is a very painful injection and for me isn’t at all effective. I should get Rexulti which for me is HUGELY effective. It might even give a bump to my weight loss. The Lithium should get dropped again tomorrow. I guess the paper work for Rexulti should get filed in a week or two.

But the ptsd zap, depression elimination and cognitive boost won’t die. Till much later at least. I’m doing a great job actually _AT_MENTION_ . No one would ever think I’m on anything.

Shortly afterwards started hearing voices every now and then At 16 my moods began to swing. At 18 had my first breakdown of sza. Started self harming and moods were severe and had delusions that evil spirits were trying to infiltrate my mind. At 22 went into remission and a year later came off my meds. Was relatively normal for five years but looking back I had residual symptoms. Was also abnormally religious At 27 it all came back. The depression and hypomania. Then the paranoia and delusions, then self harm and voices. Now I’m 36 and never been normal since I was 13. 23 years of mental illness. So I guess I forget what normal was like. Either been too high or too low."

174382513,"Hi. I was diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia almost 4 years ago, and I’m now 25 years old. I have been driving 18 wheelers for over a year, no accidents or tickets. It’s possible for the medical examiner to pass you, but you’ll need a letter from your doctor at the very least, and they’ll give you a 1 year card instead of 2 years. If the examiner rejects you, DONT GIVE UP!!! Find another one and explain to your primary care physician or psychiatrist that you ARE a safe driver. I think the worst part of schizophrenia is the self inflicted notion of mental inability or incompetence. When you tell yourself and others tell you that you’re disabled it’s easy to believe that lie. Keep you’re dreams and aspirations as big as ever, especially when people tell you that you’re incapable of something. If you know yourself and trust yourself to be a safe driver it might be better not to tell them anything, the examiners can be judgmental …holes"

It was pre-informed, but was kinda an emergency as school only got a 2 day warning cause it was so severe and really bad. But they wanted him to only take 5 excused days, the pediatrician, surgeon, and his therapist all put their feet down and told school they would give him 6 weeks to recover if school wanted to play bulkshit games. He got 3 weeks off, but we had his homework already done before his 2nd week of recovery. He sat on the computer and did it while recouping. South Dakota has a 5 day parent excused policy, so that was worse cause the nearest doctors were 90 miles away, and served 5 counties with only 6 GP. They didn’t have pediatricians out there, so the whole population saw those 6 doctors, it was so stupid. Our GP would just fax a note, I’d call and be like kid 1 is sick, she’d be like done!"

My memory of all these meds is not that great, but I have been on this dose of 800mg of Amisulrpide now for about two years. The psychosis / positive symptoms have been well managed in this time for the most part. I am now not in a stressful working environment, and now the anxiety seems to be treated well enough by the Pregabalin, I think it’s time to review the anti-psychotic. If you wanted to forward this email to Dr. _PERSON_, or speak to him, I would appreciate it. I have seen online that other people are functioning on much lower doses, and I would like to be one of those people. Likewise, if this is a bad idea then just tell me.

176157970,"I have dreams, recall, memories, and experiences of being taken out of the simulation/matrix we live in and running part of it. Like time traveling and typing on a computer on possibly another planet and interacting with folks and interacting with aliens and maybe being an alien. Obviously, the doctors and regular folk are going to assume I’m crazy, but it has given me insights into the universe and nature of time. I felt like I was in anti-de sitter space or the bulk in brane cosmology. The only proof that ET is here is when I was in college (possibly) or definitely in 2016 at home when I saw huge, black and rectangular drones and other ufos/drones and advanced craft fly over my house over the years. Sometimes, it just went over my head/consciousness because I was so numb. Like stuff I cannot explain is living through real, but different alt worlds or alt realities and history playing out different, like I’m actually living and going to other worlds simultaneously. It’s strange at best. That 
I remember the news of the future that it proved to me and I felt ‘vindicated’ after many years of human civilization finding out we lived in the damn matrix. I don’t remember details, just generalities. I don’t remember much outside the simulation, except I didn’t have schizophrenia at all and my IQ shot up to 140+. I was able to see the shape of the universe which I can only guess at best is a Torus or some rotating godel universe which is just something I have thought about recently, but really have no clue on the latter. Then I realized M theory is true, but the simulators don’t want us knowing. I thought I showed MWT (many worlds theory of quantum mechanics) was true. But since we live in a simulation and reality repeats itself indefinitely and doesn’t branch until after 2013, it makes me think each universe/“computer” is deterministic and the collection of which we call multi-verse theory. I have also thought much but at a superficial level about CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology) and wa
s told I went to the year 3000 AD before so maybe I’ll remember more as time goes on in this life. I also experienced mind uploading and immortality."

176157997,I was so sure you were going to say he was 14 or 15. I’m astounded that he is 29. That’s an awful situation to be in. It sounds like your parents are allowing him to walk all over them. Parents are weird sometimes. “Because he is our son” is not a good enough reason to allow someone to disrupt the entire home. At least not in my opinion. It has the same ring that someone in an abusive relationship saying “because I love them” does when they are rationalizing the abuse. Terrible. I hope you are able to avoid him and his awful behavior.

I know others will see it as delusions but I see them as not delusions but real. I think this is termed _NAME_-awareness - when you are aware others call it delusions but you don’t believe they are Like I believe _PERSON_ and _NAME_ are 100% real but I’m aware that others won’t That’s why I say they are delusions - not because I believe they are but because others do.

I dislike drugs and the modern approach because it tells this part of you basically this: “You’re not right to feel that way.”. Even if they don’t say this it is implied when they do things like, “Let’s focus on something positive about yourself instead.”. That essentially tells the part of you that feels sad and deep despair, “You’re wrong to feel that way.”. It doesn’t actually address what it is that makes us feel bad and steer us into the direction of relief and finding how to actually feel good from THAT place. Positive focus is just a bypass that leaves that deep wound to fester. All I know is, if I try to feel positive I just wind up sinking low again and even exhausted. Because that part of me is constantly getting the message that I shouldn’t feel that way."

176158076,"I am not sure if this is the place to post this but I have had unusual experiences while smoking marijuana. I have considered these paranormal experiences but I leave open the possibility that they could be Schizophrenic experiences related to marijuana usage. I read somewhere that certain people function normally when straight but when they smoke marijuana it can reveal Schizophrenic symptoms that were there all along but hidden. Does that make sense? I have had many strange experiences on marijuana and I really do not know these experiences are related to Schizophrenia but I am curious about it. One type of experience involves me hearing clicks or sounds around the room I am in. For example, I have a printer on my desk and I have heard clicks coming from it and clicks around the room. I cannot tell if these are naturally occurring sounds (i.e. just sounds that are normal but I experience as abnormal) or if they are actually auditory hallucinations created in my mind. I have noticed a pattern to t
hem, and it has occurred to me that something is trying to get my attention and its using these clicks or small sounds to communicate. I have noticed a pattern with them and where there can be clicks at the same time in different parts of the room. Its very freaky when it happens and it scares me. I don’t have this happen when I am not on marijuana. This only happens when I am high. Am I the only one to experience something like this? I am just curious to know if anyone else has gone through something like this. I have other interesting experiences to share but I will start with this one."

There is a whole spectrum of seizure disorders. I started out with what they call subclinical seizures. They are very mild, last for only a few seconds and you remain totally aware and conscious. They make you feel very weird afterwards. Where as with grand mal, you drop to the ground and flop like a fish. Everyone knows that part. But what they don’t know, is that you black out for 6 to 8 hours. You are walking and talking, but no one is driving the bus.
