175918630,what does the “harlots” on the face mean?
174333027,Abilify prob has one of the longest life in your body. The other meds leave at some point in a few weeks but abilify takes like months to leave your system. The withdrawals arent as bad as the other aps tho.
175918631,You can always try. If it dont work go back.
175918632,I have been called fat by different people and I have had people think I’m preg because my belly sticks out more than my boobs.
175918633,Who remembers playing G I _NAME_. I used to set up my army figurines Around my room and they would fight each other even though they don’t move or anything. I guess you got to get creative with your mind which kids don’t seem to have a problem doing
175918634,"All jobs seem impossible for the first month. For everyone, not just us with MI. Make a commitment to stay with it for at least one month before making a decision about leaving or staying. Once you have a routine, it will be much easier to continue."

Finally, processing speed abilities..."
175918636,"Sorry for the delay, long day at work and I still have to sneak a few more hours in tonight in order to have tomorrow off. Here’s what has worked for me: Take meds as directed, even when you don’t like them, unless you have an adverse reaction. Follow direction from your doctor. Do what you’re asked to, but remember that you can ask to have your treatment modified to suit you better. Be completely honest with your pdoc. Hide nothing. The things you least want to talk about are the ones you should bring up first. Meds are a partial solution at best. If you’re not combining them with therapy and CBT you’re not giving yourself a full shot at recovery. Understand that your illness will actually present about 25% of the problems in your life. The bad habits you’ve developed because of your illness will create the other 75% of the problems in your life. Identifying and fixing those bad habits will give you the elbow room and energy you need to cope with the remaining 25% of crap caused direct
ly by your health condition. Understand that energy spent bemoaning what you’ve “lost” or can no longer do is energy not being directed towards discovering what you can do, and do extremely well. Everyone of us has plenty of good choices left if we can just get off the couch and go on the needed adventure to look for them. Don’t take someone else’s word for what your limits are. Find out for yourself and make sure you test them hard. Odds are they’re better than what everyone else told you they would be. Don’t get old without testing your limits, that’s a crime. Keep a recovery journal. Use it every day if you can, several times a week if that’s what you can manage. You’ll learn from it over time. It’s also very helpful to share with your treatment team. There’s no magic bullet for mental illness. Prolonged recovery requires prolonged effort. You’re going to have to roll up your sleeves and work your promontory off to get to where you want to be. People who wait for the magic bullet 
(that specific med or therapy or unicorn something something) have all died miserable and still waiting in my experience. Invite failure. Falling on your face or ass will teach you things you didn’t know, but absolutely need to. At the very least it will teach you humility, endurance, and hopefully, perseverence. _PERSON_’ GO. FOR. IT. My 2 cents."
175918637,Sounds good. Hope you work together well. Good luck.
175918638,I’ve decided to invest in Noom. That weight loss app cuz u get a dedicated health coach on there. It’s expensive and they charge for 3 months upfront.

174333023,"Please help me figure out what I can do next for my son, he seems unreachable. I am heartbroken and devastated at how this mental illness has affected my son. My son was a star athlete, top 40 in the country, had a following of kids looking up to him, before everything went haywire. He stopped racing, we think because of this but didn't know, he started smoking pot, which I guess is the worst for anyone with this illness, and then got into legal trouble, we thought it was from the drugs. He went from this health freak, clean freak, thoughtful person, to someone who is unrecognizable. He made the national news, because of a plane incident, and then tried to commit suicide, before being committed in 2017 for 6 months. He went through the program and quit his meds the day he got out in March 2018, because he thought, and still thinks, he doesn't need them. Since then it has cost our family thousands of dollars in housing and legal fees trying to keep him safe and off the streets, money we don't have. 
The family can't keep him at home. I am still paying lawyer fees from his past episodes and trying to get him help. He was finally committed again last fall, and because he no longer trusts us after the last lock up, he did not give a release of information for the doctors to discuss his medical with us, which also meant we couldn't talk to the social worker who could've expanded his commitment but didn't. HIPAA is working against him and us. We were informed he is now being kicked out of his housing in MPLS due to his hygiene and being off meds, and I don't know how he will survive with the riots and shootings currently going on there. I live in MO, he is in MPLS, and he is no longer communicating with us. It is breaking my heart. This stress almost took my life last year after being very sick and losing over 30 pounds. I even reached out to Dr _NAME_ begging for his help, I just don't know what else to do. Please help me reach my son. Is there any drugs that helps clear their mind without all of the side af
fects they don't like? Is there nothing more we can do and it is just up to him, in his current state, whether he survives or not? He takes selfies once in a while and it looks like he's just not there, like he's lost and empty. It's heartbreaking for me to see. Where I live in MO there is no resources close to me for help, and with this Covid and my husband with COPD, I cannot go anywhere. I would appreciate any advice. Thank you"

175918645,I think you’re taking it too personally. You feel like you are letting yourself down for taking meds. But there’s nothing wrong with it. It cures many of the symptoms of the condition and enables you do to get on with your life. They’re prescribed to help you.

175918752,You’re symptom shopping so you can use another excuse for abusing your boyfriend. Asking for a diagnosis on a forum isn’t going to validate this complete disregard for his feelings. This isn’t about your feelings. It’s about you trying to control someone. You’re being childish and abusive. It needs to stop. Instead of asking for reasons you are behaving this way so you can tell him “my aspbergers makes me abusve” try going to a therapist and asking how you can stop hurting the man.
175918753,"Why do the therapists appear outside the hospital? It has happend a lot of times, is it coincidence? Did the Hospitalisation give them the opportunity to calculate where im going to be at certain times and places? Ill just put this in the same topic.

175918758,"I’ve been on SSDI for a couple of decades. About ten years ago I was checking my online bank account and saw a deposit for $11,000. My first instinct was that it was a mistake. It said it was from Social Security but I had no idea what it was for. I called Social Security and they said it was a back payment and that it was mine to spend any way I wanted to. They also said I didn’t have to “spend down”, I could keep it in my account as long as I wanted to. And I would still be receiving my monthly checks for a $1000. Geeez, it was like winning the lottery. If your money is from the SSA than give them a call and see what they say. Golden _NAME_ is right; don’t spend any of it until you talk to the SSA and get clear what it’s for. The SSA told me that mine was back pay. According to their records they had not paid me enough money in benefits for a year. I had no idea until I talked to them."

I would bring a pen, a highlighter, and colorful book markers to place for paragraphs you like in the book. I make it a synesthesia experience with a coffee, a scone, ear buds playing instrumental/electronic music, a view next to a window. It's easier to read if you don't bring a laptop with you.

175918771,"I tried to push the fact that Autism was the real issue with my Psychiatrist, and I was told that they will not change my diagnosis of Schizophrenia due to the Autism Dx being made. There is very little support for me to come off meds, so if I decide to do it, I won’t have support in place from my parents, or the mental health professionals. What then will happen is a slippery slope. If the medical professionals - and they have already done this to me before, start to write reports to my GP that have bold writing says “Going off meds against medical advice”, my life is shot. I would lose my drivers license. And that is a given. If this was to happen again, I’d lose my employment and my mobility (They did this to me for 2 years before). The Drivers Medical Board would revoke my license immediately if I was classed as ‘non-compliant’ or ‘going against medical advice’. It’s a soft power (Of sorts) that’s used to keep me in line. Subtle violence. Aggressive. They have such power ove
r me, I cannot go against them. I am completely convinced by the Autism being the issue at play here. However, I need to follow the rule of my Psychiatrist as the specialist viewpoint carries a lot of weight. What pisses me off the most is that the Psychologist who put me forward and got my dx of ASD fast tracked then decided to use it as an excuse to say she couldn’t treat me, as her techniques were not designed for those on the spectrum. All she told me originally was that it would inform her treatment of me, not lead to a complete withdrawal and her giving up on me. She kept important facts to herself awaiting the outcome. Devious She then decided to retire, and all this promise and work to be done amounted to nothing. On 2nd March, my case is going back to the psychology panel, but I am not sure what they’ll say"
175918772,Nintendo Switch does sound fun! I think the fact that you’ve been recovering also plays a role. You find joy in things you used to like before your illness got severe.

175918778,That’s the most expensive therapist I’ve ever heard of. It’s normal to be nervous when meeting a therapist or psychiatrist for the first time. I see the appeal of a close therapist but I think how she does her job outweighs in importance the factor of how close she is.

However sz when it should be sz-a is a marked improvement on having a pd dx that was highly nonsensical. Not that I dismiss having a pd.

I learned positive thinking by practicing positive thinking. I was raised in a positive household. I look at anxiety as something to pay attention to on a daily basis, practicing healthy habits, and learning as much as I can about it. Because mine seems to have a genetic component, I have been on meds for 10 years and plan to continue them. I don't look at meds a a crutch, but as an essential part of good mental health. (If I were a diabetic, I would not look at taking insulin as a crutch either. Same kind of thing.) It's easy to forget about preventive, proactive ways to manage anxiety when I'm not feeling anxious, but I know if I don't keep on practicing, I eventually hit a wall of some sort, from which it is more difficult to extricate myself. I've had 10 years of practice at anxiety-management, and my life is better because of it."

On a side note, I read a thread about Amyloban 3399. I still had some Lion’s Mane extract, which has never fully helped me because I did not use a higher dose, so I tried it again. It worked. The effects dont last long and my depth perception felt slightly off, but it worked. For about 3 hours the voices were very muffled and few, the derealization was nearly gone, the strange pressures in my head were going away, my memory was slightly coming back, and executive functioning came back somewhat. Downside is My delusions were still there along with depression. So… I ordered more. I will 
see if this brand is more effective. I see my doctor on Friday and plan on telling him everything. Until then, I need to work for Uber/ Lyft unless I want to have no internet, lights shut off and spoiled food, among other things. Wish meh luck! Oh! And thanks for reading. This site is helping me vent out a few things that I have bottled up for years."

If you responded to minocycline for negative symptons in the past this might also help you for brain inflammation. What I’m trying to explain is colloidal gold is known good for mental health, Silver not so but it’s also potent natural anti biotic.

I feel like everywhere I turn I'm hitting a wall and lately all I have done is go to work come home and sleep. Crying in between like it's my light snack of the day. I have asthma and I get sick often cuz of it. While with everything going on I ended up not being able to breathe and ended up getting tested for covid and I'm fine, negative, but I lost days of work, can barely pay bills, people at work have literally called me disgusting, and my roommate literally blames me for her boss not letting her work even though I'm fine and gave her boss a paper stating so. Then to top it off I started talking to a new boy and I thought everything was going well and every single time we are supposed to hangout he cancels on me. And it's always like an hr before he supposed to get here. Never in advance, it's always an excuse with his rides or a lawyer thing, and at first I believed him but now it's been like at 
least 5 times and I cant mentally handle being rejected over and over. I like him but at what cost do I allow this to continue. It would be different if he at least would talk to me on the phone but I feel like he doesnt take the hint, I never wanna say call me now I need your voice so I just you wanna chat on the phone tell me about your day and hes either asleep already or is with his neighbor talking. So I go to bed instead. Maybe I'm naive and thinking hes not really lying to me but I dont want to assume everyone is bad like I usually do."

It wasn’t until recently I tried Alanine (I have used a different brand but this one is much better.) On webmd it states that Alpha-Alanine helps medication work better. It’s helping me so far and I think it is either enhancing or potentiating the effects of the medication. My main curious wonder is if I have to keep taking Alanine with my medication for a life time or is it like Sarcosine which I will not need to take it but for a few months to years. So… now only time will tell. For now, I’m glad I can feel the anxiolytics effects of my medication. I’m less depressed and dpdr is slowly subsiding. Things are slowly looking real."

175918927,I don’t believe the hype about nofap mainly because of my experience of retaining (sorry if too much info). I went psychotic both times. I don’t think it is healthy to retain too long just as it is not healthy to do it too often. If it bleeds that’s probably too much.

175918947,"Most places I have worked/managed offered flexible breaks for everyone. The reasoning went: people tire out at different rates. If person A wants to take their break time at 10, and person B wants to take a break at 1, that is fine in most settings. Obviously in places like retail/customer service where someone needs to be available at all times, they will need to make sure there is coverage for their break. But there is no problem with saying “hey, I need a break. Can you find coverage for me for ten minutes?” I mean, if we didn’t have that, how could people even go to the bathroom? Even in fast-paced jobs, there should always be enough coverage for one person to take a break. If there isn’t, that’s a problem with management style, not with the workers who need the breaks. Some employers mistreat their employees by forcing them to skip breaks or not granting them time to visit the bathroom. And those jobs end up losing a lot of people which costs a lot of money. Every time you hire someo
ne new, that’s a significant expense. If you can work with a person to keep them satisfied and happy at their job, you don’t have to spend money hiring and training someone new. You also end up with more competent workers who are capable of doing their jobs more quickly. They also take fewer sick days, because they don’t get burnt out."

So now I have to drive around with expired tags for another 2 weeks. I could very well get a ticket over this. I'm beat. I feel like everything is going wrong right now and I can't catch a break.

174333095,"No, it’s not. It’s not just a choice. I can drink 10 energy drinks and I still have no energy. I can’t seem to accomplish anything ordinary. Maybe I don’t have schizophrenia and I’m just weak willed, a genetic thing. But I just go with it and take the money because the options are none or limited. I have no potential or life anymore. I don’t think it’s spiritual anymore, but I believe there’s a quantum aspect to the mind so we get “woo woo” thoughts. I think the suffering is real and that there is a scientific explanation and cure like most if not everything. Personally, I think I was involved in some major stuff but everyone here doesn’t believe it (I don’t care) and has a 2 second memory. The medical community has failed me as well as society and government. Even the media, which I have no interest or relation to. I know I’m not alone. If you don’t believe in aliens or that aliens are here then I cannot really have a conversation with you or anyone else because that’
s the tip of the ice berg and the basic, elementary aspect of it. The stuff I deal with and talk about is so advanced and out there, I have a hard time functioning and grasping it myself. That’s why I refuse to go to traditonal therapy now. I don’t care if someone has a PhD from Harvard or Stanford or from Devry and makes 70k a year being a miserable, second rate therapist. I’m done with them all. I rather do my own thing because I don’t think I have something in the DSM-5 anymore. If I got psychosis, it might be from caffeine (monster drinks) I drink several a day and can’t quit and stop. If I got a mood disorder, it could be from bipolar (same thing with the psychosis aspect). I believe I had hypomania – bipolar type 2 before college because I was so high functioning and fast and laser focused. The drugs and stuff gave me a psychotic break. The DP/DR and dissociation was from severe torture and trauma. The fact that the government/rich people raped me in college and got away with it, really ????
?? with me. Just because I’m schizophrenic and a MAN doesn’t mean I’m not a victim and it’s not REAL. I only know this because I got vague dreams about it and remember them telling me several times in the future on the television. It’s some sort of mind control operation(s) and programming. I’m more into non-traditional/non-standard therapy like DID/PTSD/Hypnosis/Regression type stuff. I was never abused as a kid, so I don’t think I got DID, but I often think of the quantum aspect of things and other ???? going on and the psychic phenomena that seems theoretically impossible. If you go to your standard second rate doctor with limited thought capacity and lacks creativity and insight, then they’re just going to keep giving you meds and put you through the revolving door repeatedly and you’ll never get help. I was being tortured every day and every second (been hospitalized over 20 times) and now I’m sort of happy and content because of the work and criticism I get because of it and because 
of what I believe. I don’t think I even belong here sometimes despite my diagnosis. I have had psychosis and some fixated, intrusive thoughts that bother me that border on pathological, distrurbing, and cause agony inside me. Stuff like Matrix Theory and other darker things. But I just troop on, take meds, talk to family, and pray. I have memories working for the Dark Side in my past lives so I’m familiar with their technologies. I identify and love the light side now. They told me I’m from 2036 several times (_NAME_, which falls on deaf ears). Not sure how I got here but now people are talking about a potential civil unrest/civil war and I’ve been warning you guys for years about it. No one believes me. Not my fault. It’s all part of getting the nasty evil out of me – the thoughts, memories, and emotions. I lived through it, although different versions of it. For me, I have no motive or no desire. Maybe just to protect myself, get some help, and get better. I really don’t care anymore. That’s 
why I have my blog. For the basics, I will come here. YouTube literally censors me. They said they can send minds or I believe consciousness back in time. I guess. Not sure how that works. No way I’m going to live until 2036. No ??????? way."

For me there’s an unholy alliance between organising and planning/multi step task difficulties and what might be seen as negative symptoms . However if I can help others in a way that utilises my strengths, I happily do so. Without getting too political I do think there is a belief being spread,irresponsibly, from the top that needing support is a character flaw…Unfortunately that pile of steaming crap is swallowed hook,line and sinker by a large part of the general population. I’ve had a fair amount of criticism ,including here, but very little in the way of help and support to lessen the effects of any cognitive difficulties. That’s because there’s a presumption by many that your verbal and non-verbal abilit
ies will automatically be quite evenly matched . Generally that’s true , but if not how things are for you then the failure of health/mental health professionals to pick up on that , and thus provide needed help and support, can result in significant, negative consequences."

My ex had neighbours who would clap or laugh at their tv. He insisted they only did it to provoke him when he made mistakes, even though they had no way of knowing when that was. He is sz. You probably make some noises that disturb them as well, it’s the downside of living in an apartment building with thin walls. You all just gotta remain friendly to each other and remember everyone has a right to exist. It’s not directed at you. No one is so petty they spend their entire day listening to the neighbour and making random noises as all hours to piss them off. I have a neighbour who vacuums at midnight, and another one who snores. But I know they don’t purposedly do it to disturb my sleep."

175919105,You welcome! “Mind Over Mood” is supposed to be a really good book on applying CBT. It’s available on Amazon.
175919106,"Yes, correct. I always had a running commentary. If nothing else, quietly in the background. And during times of stress my head would get louder. I just got used to it. Now that I know what a quiet head sounds like, I don’t know how I tolerated it. I don’t handle the noise very well anymore at all."
175919107,Are you talking to me???
175919108,"I have always been fairly asocial,introverted and shy. Soon after starting at Felsted,a British public school, the conversation in the dorm got round to sex. While the other boys were boasting and bragging I was honest about my lack of knowledge . That marked me out as ‘weird’ and was taken as justification to verbally bully me. The social anxiety started very soon after that. Our local village vicar wrote to my housemaster about it, to get a reply saying that some boys are the type to encourage being bullied. That was over 50 years ago,so hopefully things have changed for the better. I have never gotten over those 5 years of bullying at Felsted. A situation not helped by a psychiatric system that historically has adopted a ‘condemn the individual for reacting badly to the situation’ approach , rather than showing compassion and empathy"

I usually find the list disproving my thoughts/experiences is longer than the one supporting it. I’ll test my thinking with a trusted person. I also do a lot of grounding.

175919125,"I think this is a very powerful and useful notion, to admit that the person shapes their own delusions. Understanding this exactly, and finding the precise reason for why my delusions are this way or another, is how I gained a bit of clarity. Yes, absolutely, all of my delusions were introduced with extensive justifications that conveniently enough were either difficult or impossible to prove or disprove."
175919126,"Long ago I was late on an assignment I had done extra over and beyond like say 16 pages when only ten were required. It was a big assignment and I put it in my folder to take it in. Somehow I could not find it the next morning. I had to look through my folder like three times but it wasn’t there. I had to tell the teacher I couldn’t find it and must have left it at home. I went home and looked for it and couldn’t find it. Eventually I looked in the folder and it was there in the back. I had it all along. So I turned it in the next day, my teacher cut the point value in half.....I got a C despite going well beyond the number of pages needed. If I hadn’t done that I could’ve failed outright on that paper. It’s teachers like that who cause my anxiety today."

He also said that if I ever killed myself, he would immediately kill himself too, because he couldn’t live in a world where his child was dead. I don’t know why that hit me so hard, but it did. He made me promise to outlive him. And even though he’s been dead for nearly 13 years, I am still keeping my promise."

175919148,"Do you believe severe anxiety can lead to psychosis? Thinking back on all the times I experienced psychosis, it all started with some drastic life-changing event or trauma which, in turn, caused such severe anxiety that sort of spiraled into psychosis. Is it the same for any of you?"
175919149,I don’t masturbate. I have but don’t anymore. I just don’t get that much from it. I can make myself orgasm but the orgasm is not so intense and it’s boring etc I rather have intimacy with someone else etc When I have madturbated in the past i had no shame after. I madturbated in a porno once. I regret it. I made 2000 kr . They gave me a huge dildo which was there idea. I did what they said .

175919171,"Banks create money, then they loan it to you, then you have to pay them back with interest. Being in debt it not a crime, but slavery is. Feudalism is coming back into fashion after the biggest empire started a trade war with the Middle Kingdom. _PERSON_ says we are begging to do business with him, what he means is that the aristocrats want to extend their feudal land ownership overseas to China once again regaining Hong Kong and destabilising the biggest economy on the planet. Who has to pay? You, the disabled and the unfit, who have to justify why they are not working to pay off the debts of America. That’s why _NAME_ got his knighthood, for keeping the peace and strengthening the special relationship which keeps minorities in check.

I said no I don't believe it and she brought up a Hercules reference and he might of not had felt like he had strength all the time.

175919195,"A lot of times living on your own just takes common sense. Most of it is not some mysterious secret. You feed yourself and keep your place clean. That’s the basics. I ain’t saying it’s always easy but a lot of it isn’t difficult. If you live by yourself you will probably have three or four or five of the same bills to pay each month. If you do all your business online; internet, phone, utilities, banking; it makes it easier. Just set up automatic payments and the payments will be automatically deducted from your bank account at the same time each month. Once a month you write out a check for the rent. If you have a therapist or case worker I’m sure they would give whatever help they could and give you tips on living alone. My advice is be nice to the neighbors. You don’t have to be overly friendly but try to be civil and on good terms with them. I started out OK at my current place, but now all my neighbors hate me and a few of them just use me for their plans and that’s all I am to t
hem. A stepping stone. Anyways, I lived by myself for 7 years. It can be fun and it’s neat having your own space. You just have to stay on top of certain things and take care of a few responsibilities."

But then again, I think of my sons. My mom. How much they already lost. How alone this would leave them. And what if we died and the relief we needed was only a month away. It's so unpredictable. Fight it baby. I tell myself I'll do it next week. Or tomorrow. When ur at the point we are, why rush? If it's all we can do, put it off. U still have control over ending ur pain. So wait and take a chance at living. It may surprise u. It may surprise me. Let's hang in there together!! How about it?"

175919223,a huge cause of psychosis and cloud editting sz frustration potentially could be when your body channel cloud source ware doesn't match your appetite. appetite energising calms _NAME_ sz if not too greedy. it's my dream for my source ware to match my appetite in a deep enough ongoing climate. being art centric rather than stock centric could help make the match easier. cloud manifesting tech could help future generations match their source ware to their appetites and be less sz frustrated with the collective cloud wrap around squeeze. like a canvas for each cloud in a collage where each horse can win the same race with less mongering conflict and more art therapy.

175919229,My mum is visiting from Sweden and I hadn’t seen her for four years. It’s great to see her again but she is complicated and difficult and a handful. This morning Christmas Day she started yelling at me for wearing to much makeup. wtf?:lipstick: I’m not wearing much makeup but she thinks I look evil n hard if I wear more than mascara and lipstick. I love tattoos and piercings my mum hates them. My favourite style is gothic n then punk n hippie hardrock b n Bohemia’s but she has different taste to me. Not nice to have a fight Christmas morning. She got her knickers in a knot saying I look awful and how people perceive me badly if I wear too much makeup etc and she was actually yelling and said awful things. I replied I like it and it’s none of her business as I’m a adult. Anyone else had a Christmas argument? So silly. She leaves back to Sweden 15 January so I don’t know when I will see her again after she has left. I prefer more makeup than I’m wearing. She thinks I look awful.
175919230,Side effects suck. I know my pdoc won’t change mine either.

175919238,"I struggle with this too. I am ok at work as I am forced to do things I wouldn’t do otherwise, which I think is kinda healthy. In terms of hobbies, I have been working with a psychologist to try and build myself back up again. I am about to start a board games group on a Thursday night to see how that goes. I am also doing puzzles now I hope, as I got one for Christmas and I enjoyed it so I bought another one. I also just got a new car, so I am cleaning that now. You just need to try other things. As you can see from the above, it doesn’t have to be major. The psychologist says that it’s better to have lots of smaller things to do so if you fail to do something, it doesn’t have a bit effect on you."
175919239,"Yes, but not everyone lives before they die."
175919240,Yes I had quite a few episodes (what I now know as delusions) at parties and hearing voices in my early 20s. Everyone thought it was the weed making me paranoid. I didn’t get a diagnosed for a decade.

I'm tired and exhausted yet can't sleep.. The depression was coming, slowly. I just don't know what which chemicals have done what.. I will stop all chemicals and take them as prescribed then see how I feel.. It's just that I've given up on psychiatry. My psychiatrist and doctor does nothing for me.. Therapy I need but jeez.. What horribleness and miserableness. I'm listening to _PERSON_. I like her.. She's depressed as hell but makes good songs and doesn't give a **** about anything."

I’ve taken Gabapentin in the past but, again, after _PERSON_ I just don’t trust anything. She was dismissive of my side effects and I had to insist that I need to be off it because I feared permanent movement disorders. I explained my tongue went numb the first night, and I was gnawing on it a few days into treatment which seem to be huge red flags and my heart felt like it was skipping beats pretty intensely plus hyperglycemia episodes. She discounted most of my concerns. She was hesitant but agreed I was outwardly stable. I know she is there to help but I am going to look elsewhere to someone who maybe pretends better to have open ears. Also, I’m off pot now but fear damage is done. Only time will tell. Thanks for fast reply. Anyone with more experience please don’t hesitate to assuage my fears if you’ve been where I am. As far as tonight with the melatonin

175919267,"Hello, I’m new to this fourm so I wasn’t sure where to put this. My name is _NAME_ and I’ve been diagnosed with psychotic depression, but as of late I’ve been thinking that this might not at all be true, my hallucinations began around the age of eight years old around this time I was also pretty much mute, hyperactive, thoughty life was a tv show, and my classmates would talk for me and the hallucinations continued until I was 13 and during this time when I was 13 I also had very bad delusions and was also depressed I isolated myself and barely talked to anyone and experienced psychosis during that time and I would hear voices I also had vivid dreams and believed them to be reality and this continued until I was 16 I would mostly keep to myself and want to be along but feeling lonely at the same time I was often depressed because I believed I was being outcasted by people in my high school I also thought people we’re watching me from the windows and I barely talked or showed much emotion 
and when I did talk it would sometimes come out weird around this time I had another episode where I hallucinated and still hung on to old delusions I then got into new age stuff like tarot cards and psychic stuff my memory of all of this is blurred but I do remember that I thought I had telekinesis powers because of the dreams I had back when I was 14 to 17 anyway I got into this stuff but eventually I was just diagnosed with psychotic depression around the age of 18 I had another psychotic episode where I didn’t take my pills and I became very paranoid about the people in school and felt that they were talking about me behind my back and that people were watching me from the windows now I’m still 18 and I’m on wellbutrin for the morning and latuda so I can sleep better. But my question is how can it be psychotic depression when the hallucinations and delusions were there even before I was depressed? What do you think does it sound like something else or am I just over thinking this?"
175919268,I’m attracting roaches. Any tips? It’s like I can see the dishes but the body won’t let me go to the mess to clean it

174333160,I dxd myself in 2008 and a team of doctors at UCLA confirmed it although when I went they first said no way because of my age. After observing me for 3 days seeing me interact with other patients (hate that word) and talking with me they said yes. I was relieved and meds helped right away but had to find the right cocktail and I take supplements too now which helps with the negative symptoms
175919271,"i just sit in my own filth, all i’ve been doing this winter is smoking and eating. my place is already a mess again. and im telling myself i’ll wait until spring to clean it. i need to downsize my living situation i think and get rid of some stuff. and i have no motivation to get a job. i feel like as long as im diagnosed sza and on meds i will just continue to live on my benefits and not stress myself out. i havent cooked a meal in over a month, just eating gas station food, and sometimes subway."

175919273,"I have the text message and it did send me into a psychotic world that’s why I’m here . I didn’t have sz before this happened. I have also had incidents where I hallucinated people saying things to me like you said, I was staring directly at them when they said it. It’s so confusing."

175919294,What the caption says.
175919295,I am currently in the process of testing for MS. I have no signs other than severe fatigue that has plagued me most of my life but at this point is very crippling. 6 months ago I went for an mri if my brain. They wanted to see more detail so they did a follow up with color. I have somewhere around 30 white matter brain lesions. Soon I will go for a follow up brain and spine MEI to see if there has been any change. If the MRIs look positive or inconclusive they will send me for a spinal fluid test. So for someone with no usual symptoms of MS it is possible to be tested and find out for sure if that is the course you want to go. My fatigue is so severe that in a sleep study I did my daytime sleep latency averages 5 min over 10 hours. Meaning they kept me up for 2 hours at a time and then said I could fall asleep and on average it took me 5 min to pass out. I don’t want to have MS but if I do then maybe I can get additional medicine to help.

I didn’t notice much of a difference other than not having to get poked every month and I think a more steady dose throughout the month. At the end of the months I would feel a little uneasy on the injections. Sometimes theyd tell me to take extra pills near the end of the month. I prefer pills myself, but abilify injection was not bad if you are going by way of injection"

And then I’m going to hang a sign on my neck that says people with sz not dangerous and the mentally ill can rather be victims of violence. Then I’ll die and people will feel guilty that I died because of _USER_ID_ and try to change things around. I hope this plan works but I’m afraid that I can never climb a tree due to my physical disability. Maybe I can play loud music to get people’s attention.
175919328,"we didn’t have that option when i was in school, but my niece already has her associates degree and has most of her general _NAME_ completed, she’s a senior in high school now. that is the thing i dislike most about college, is i just want to get into my field of study and not have to take the other classes. wish we would have had that option when i was in high school. they take classes at the local community college before receiving their high school diploma"
175919329,Hi and welcome. I was so nervous before I wrote my first post. I think you’ll see that many of us are easy going people. Enjoy!
175919330,Have you been sleeping properly? Missing nights can cause that
175919331,I like Lazy-boy-chairs.
175919332,Mine stopped instantly.Did they slowly fade out?
175919333,Well done for not drinking alcohol. Be proud!
175919334,"Not only do you not know for sure what your taking, but you don’t know for sure what the dosage is you’re taking. That could be another whole problem."
175919335,Thanks all I really appreciate it.
175919336,"Finally out of the hospital... I was there for 13 days. They put me on Vraylar. It's working pretty well. I'm going to do a PHP. I go tomorrow for the assessment. I'm planning on doing it at a different hospital, closer to my house. The closer hospital has a trauma IOP that I can do when I finish the PHP. Hoping for that. They also adjusted my antidepressant while I was there, and put me on a supplement that help with self injury urges. I had been self harming while I was in the hospital. They almost out me on extra precautions which would have sucked hard. The hospital I went to allows smoking, and the extra precautions would have taken that away, and also made it where I couldn't leave the unit at all, had to wear gown instead of my own clothes, etc. For awhile, they had to take my sheets and give me a heavy quilt because my suicidal thoughts and hallucinations were telling me to hang myself with them. I even had to give them all my pants because the demons were telling me to use those, too. It f
eels good to be out finally tho."
175919337,"Take 12 hours before you want to wake up. This should give it plenty of time to get out of your system. If you are still sleepy, this is something I believed called the benzo hangover effect and some benzos cause it worse than others, it’s based on how long or short acting they are. If you go on a long acting one such as ativan, you will be less likely to experience this hangover."
175919338,"I woke up today with no panic attack. Typically when I’ve fallen asleep lately I wake up to immense panic and have to get out of bed right away to get oriented. One time I almost had a second episode but resisted it with all my being. Today I woke up smoothly. I took only a quarter of .5 Clonazepam. I take 1/8 after work and 1/8 when I get ready for bed. Seems to be best thing so far. I’ve been a crazy insomniac since first episode about 50 days ago. My current doc hates benzos but I’ve seen (2) people on here that do primarily a benzo treatment plan. I may look for a doctor comfortable with that. I understand risk of abuse, I’ve overcome addiction before (alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana) so I’d like to think I can moderate which sounds paradoxical, huh?"
175919339,"It is thought the genes responsible for cystic fibrosis can actually afford a selective advantage in heterozygous individuals. Maybe, because sz is polygenic, some of these genes in isolation can be beneficial. Maybe _USER_ID_% of folk are unlucky enough to inherit just enough bad genes but overall the population is stronger having these genes in circulation"
174333176,"Sometimes I forget that slow and steady is an option lol. I tend to think if I'm not doing something on the highest difficulty, then I'm failing. But that's not true at all. You earned a Master's degree despite a serious illness! That's inspiring!"

175919341,"So my voices pretended to be an almighty entity that I believe in and made me a deal that they would heal me if I followed their rules. I broke the deal the next day after realizing it was my mean voices, not said almighty entity that constructed the deal. Now they keep saying you broke the covenant and you have to hurt somebody to atone. It’s driving me crazy and I’m choosing to say no to them. What do I do? I know the voices aren’t real and the covenant is meaningless."

175919346,"I am going to ask my doctor for Clonazapam 0.5 mg prn. If he won’t give me that I may buy a bottle of whiskey and take a shot when I have severe anxiety at home. I thought of this tonight. It’s not ideal, but my anxiety is severe, with hyperventilation, light-headedness, tingling hands, and the anxiety itself."

175919348,"I’m still wondering how the non-war people stop the war people. Please explain this. If they could just be stopped, why haven’t the many protests and legislation and speaking out against wars and terrorism worked? There’s a lot more to stopping things than just saying STOP. This wish is a nice one but you haven’t explained exactly how this will work."
174333175,"I was tested by a neuropsychologist in 2012. She was with my pdr. They said that school is too much for me. They failed, I now have a university degree in physiotherapy and was taking 5 classes/semester. Yes schizophrenia lowered my intelligence but not to the point of not getting my degree. Without schizophrenia I would have been a Dr, that’s what I always wanted."

175919353,"I just wanna feel better. Everyday is a constant battle inside of my head. Rational thought tells me I'm overreacting, but the anxiety, and depression tell me otherwise. I tell my wife maybe a quarter of the time about how I feel because I don't want her to see me as a weak man, and result in her wanting to divorce me. Even that sounds ridiculous. But my thoughts tell me otherwise. Sometimes it doesn't seem like she even cares. I want to seek help but I'm too broke to be able to afford it. I just want this to end. I get worked up over the tiniest of things, and it ruins my whole day. Thoughts of worthlessness, weakness, and loneliness cloud my head 24/7. I need help. For the longest time I just thought I was weak, or that I was just a teenager with out of wake hormones. But even at 24 I feel the same, if not worse than ever. I wanted to avoid therapy and medication. But now it may be my only hope if I want to keep living any longer"
175919354,what meds r u on now?

175919358,Welcome to the forum! Good to have you.
174333190,"Since many of us here on the Schizophrenia & Psychosis forum struggle with motivation I thought maybe we should have a thread where we post motivation tips, things we’re trying to get motivation to do, and encouragement for each other. I’ll start. I’m struggling with motivation to clean and leaving the house. I only go the same places over and over , I never go further than certain areas. I need to break out of that somehow but am not sure how because any kind of change even little, scares me."

175919361,don’t let the panic rule you !! I had a debilitating panic disorder and the moment I learned to ignore the fear that is associated with panic I defeated all anxiety !! it’s not easy so don’t plan on it just “going away”…you have to work at it but you can do it !!

My BP has been high in past due to HA but has been regulated more recently w coping mechanisms and working out etc. I have been eating not so good over last 2 months and today feel short of breath and my chest and insides hurt so a bit nervous it’s BP related.

My ancestors had creative ways to play with fire lol. Nowadays there are laws about it because elders kept doing the burning land thing and that led to several forest fires.

175919373,I think exercising and being in the sunshine helps to counter depression.
175919374,Where is the line between intrusive thoughts and voices? I experience a constant stream of consciousness that make useless and inappropriate commentary all day long. When i was younger these thoughts suggested self harm. But this voice/thoughts sounds like my own voice. I can ignore them most if the time but when i am alone i find it more difficult to the point i start pacing and muttering ti myself under my breath. Any suggestions????

175919380,Also who’s life story do you like the best. I think I like _NAME_’s life story more because I think he suffered more.
175919381,"Among the lilies, there are some flowers bleeding; Among the broken, souls weep beyond the grave. I saw their tears, and I pondered upon their lives. When they stared at me, they pondered upon my life. It was my turn now; I started bleeding beside a grave. A child approached me, but I saw darkness through her eyes. “Dear child, What makes you to be so afraid of me?” The child stepped back, and I wept more and more. I, bent, weep for the souls and the lilies who already died. And so, in this world dried of love and compassion, I will lay myself to rest beside this pool of grass. And tomorrow, I will wake up and I shall try to love again. ""Here, you are thirsty. Have a cup of water from that lake. Replenish yourself and cross the bridge with me."" ""Oh, sir; I see my great-grandmother! I haven’t talked to her for years. Please tell me that she can now hear me. I wanted to talk to her again. Oh, I see my sister!

We have set a goal towards moving out and will start seriously looking next week.

Thinking of you and your lovely horse."
175919386,"It’s called the invisible hand. What you’re talking about would destroy the economy. I’m no UBI expert, but _NAME_ and others have suggested $1000 a month for every person in the USA. I’m not trying to be an ass or anything. It sounds like you took an economics course, but you would know that that type of stuff leads to shortages and other worse things and even leads to Socialism, which some people may or may not like. Personally, I think the current power structure would never let this happen. I think we live in a pyramid type society (elite on top) and I’m okay with that. For sure it can be improved a lot."
175919387,I really have no idea if it’s drug free. They were smoking weed which is legal here tho so I shouldn’t jusdge too much
175919388,"I think it’s important to know what factors can result in discontinuation of medication without a relapse. The problem is with the quality of the research undertaken in this area. There’s often a ‘Meds are bad’ mindset in those promoting/pushing such research, and a desire to beef up the results of people discontinuing meds."

If you want to sober up again, keep fighting and trying to stay sober, realizing your mistake and trying harder next time, then that’s not so bad, many of us have done it. Keep up the good fight, get back on the wagon, and try to analyze and learn from the slip. You can do it!"

Thought I’d share on your thread since it’s not THAT novel of a thing and thus isn’t fully worthy of a thread in itself. _AT_MENTION_ are you surviving still?

175919400,"Hi _NAME_, sorry to hear about the things that you are experiencing, but it is very good that you here because it's never good to isolate ourselves physically or mentally and putting feelings into words relieves some of the heart’s anguish. I had a similar experience where I had to go to ER twice because I didn't understand what was happening to me and they told me that I was dehydrated. I started doing my own research then I started to identify with others and understand. That was many years ago; it was scary at the time but I got through it with help and support from others. Healing of any kind is a gradual process but with assistance and perseverance you may find that you can learn to lessen the intensity. Here are some tips that might help: ""• Anxiety cannot increase forever and you cannot experience peak levels of anxiety forever. Physiologically there is a point at which our anxiety cannot become any higher and our bodies will not maintain that peak level of anxiety indefinitely. At that 
point, there is nowhere for anxiety to go but down. It is uncomfortable to reach that peak but it is important to remember this anxiety will even out and then go down with time. • Emotions are like a wave, they will come and they will go. • You have experienced this before, you know what to expect, and you will be able to handle it. • Avoidance is anxiety's best friend. Avoidance now will mean sustained anxiety in the future"" www.anxiety.org"

175919405,"Yeah that’s true, I’m going to see about stopping it, that makes sense that it could be causing some of my problems. I think part of my depression is rooted in how stressed and paranoid/anxious I’ve been feeling too since it’s so overwhelming.

175919411,"Find the solution instead of looking at the problems. I dont mean to be blunt but you got this man! this covid shit is not going to last and once I got out of high school I realized how hard it was to make friends. You actually have to try and put yourself out there which I was not use to at all. I picked up Jiu Jitsu and made life long connections. If you have a dog take them to the dog park, make conversation with other people about their dog. We are close to the finish line to returning to a normal society, keep your head up."
175919412,"It’s a common, but wrong lifeattitude some of us adapt when we set much higher standards to ourself than we do to others. I would think a major contributing factor is if you have had strict parents that tell you things are supposed to be a certain way that they dictate, and when you feel you can’t live up to that which they want you see yourself as a failure. This has happened to me. I have serious self-hurt and escape from reality issues that I’m trying to work through. I feel that I have improved though. This last years I have had less episodes and a healthier attitude towards life. I guess it’s harder in the culture where you live because there is less individuality. But the thing is you don’t have to be a slave to your families or societys expectations. It is possible to be sucsessfull in very many ways and forms without doing what it is you think your family or society want. The question is rather what you want. What makes you happy. How can you be a sucsess on your own terms? You go
t to let up and give yourself a break. I mean how many times have you looked at another person and thought I wish they would just die so the world can become a better place. I bet probably no one. We all have to contribute according to our own abilities, and if your ability is low that is not something to be ashamed of. Everybody on this forum is probably under par when it comes to ability. I know you have extra difficulty with your physical condition, but again nothing to be ashamed of. If you lived in my city I would probably meet you and have a cup of tea or something, so don’t think everyone will reject you because you don’t have the best ability."
175919413,"I had this done as I have literally been on all antipsychotics and am either allergic, or got no relief. All the apps it said should work best for me, I am allergic to. Everything else I had been in double the highest doses to try and get something to work. Currently only on xanax, been off appt since Aug 1. No change as I said nothing helped me before, even hospital would release me saying there was nothing to do so why keep me inpatient. Also antidepressants don’t work on me. Hoping to get into a drug trial once I get my RSD under control again, but that’s gonna take a year or more. I honestly think the test was a waste of money unless your insurance will pay for it. I’m glad Medicare paid in full, cause 900 bucks for a cheek swabs is ludicrous."

Fate had me get schizophrenia. I’m in hell sometimes. I’ve had it more than once. Part of my delusional thinking/system. No-one believes me or most rational people don’t believe in past lives although string theory and loop quantum gravity allows it. The only issue I have is remembering past lives, which may have to do with quantum physics like quantum entanglement or superposition. I’m not sure. That or I’m an android in a time loop. I sometimes have the delusion I live in a sim. I can’t really expect much for myself without a cure. I tried all sorts of supplements and meds and nothing works. I tried clozaril and almost died! I’m on 9 mg of Vraylar now. I’m addicted to energy drinks (I drink 8 a day now…) and doctors won’t diagnose me with ADD or give me adderall or ritalin despite my mom saying I had it as a

175919422,So like I’ve been looking for a therapist recently and I feel stuck. The one I had been seeing threw me out after 3 years pretty suddenly. And I’ve been looking for a new one ever since… Unfortunately I keep finding ones I either just don’t click with or are just flat out terrible. So like do any of you have specific things you look for in a pdoc/therapist?? Any suggestions of how to find a good one??
175919423,I value what you have to put out there _AT_MENTION_ . I think you are in really good shape. The strategy in Starcraft probably helps you mentally. Nothing wrong with a mental workout.
175919424,I would be satisfied with that if I could do that. Maybe except the balls part but I know what you mean
175919425,That sounds like a lot of fun.
175919426,"I used this process to quit weed. It didn’t help me with alcohol. For alcohol, I had to do the unofficial ‘benzo taper’. Drink one day, off 1 day, drink one day, off 2 days. Lowering the dose each time I drank. Plus I had to switch from hard liquor to beer after a few weeks. I started off with 6 shots of Smirnoff and lowered it half a shot each time I drank. Then I switched to 4 beers and that took a while to stop. The whole quitting process took like half a year. Hope this helps. Good luck _AT_MENTION_"
175919427,I usually try to aim for 5000 steps. 10000 steps is a ridiculous amount to walk everyday. My doctor said that it’s fine to walk 5000 steps everyday. Many times I’ll fall short depending on how motivated I feel. Even 4000 steps everyday is a healthy amount. The whole idea is to keep moving.

175919429,"Well, sometimes it might be sore for a couple days. Think thats due to getting a more dull needle."
175919430,"That’s really common where I live. Immediate neighbours might say hi, everyone else pretends you don’t exist. Unfortunately that’s just how it is. I wouldn’t take it personally."

175919432,Thanks _USER_ID_ I will get an appointment at the job centre to see what I can get
175919433,I’m sorry for your loss _AT_MENTION_.
175919434,_AT_MENTION_ very well spoken
175919435,See I need to ask bc I am going to please woman more these few years of maturity so I’m willing to go for it and take a chance at it plus I know we’ll both enjoy it me and my partner.
175919436,"Good Evening everyone, So yesterday I had a horrible calf cramp that was excruciating. It lasted quite a few minutes. Afterwards, I noticed my leg was sore from it. Also the area around my calf starts to get a burning sensation every now and then. I thought nothing of it until I google something and DVT. I nearly had a panic attack. So I am age 29 male, 175lbs and have not had surgery nor been in a hospital. I haven't flown on a airplane in years. I do exercise somewhat regularly although not as much because it is so hot here. So on paper I don't have any of the risk factors but I have head of young people getting it so nevertheless I am very concerned. I havce my annual doctors appointment in two weeks. I am wondering if I should wait that long or if I should ask to go sooner. Apart of me thinks this is nothing more than a bad _NAME_ horse but I can't help but thinking it may be a sign of DVT. What does everyone think?"
175919437,"I know you have the illness for many many years, can you still function fine with cognitive decline? Your posts make sense, obviously you can think clearly."
175919438,Internationally shipping a prescription only drug sounds very illegal
175919439,"Really its all in your head, you control your emotions about others and blaming others just makes you worse. Fight for yourself as no one can help you more than yourself. I already said it but you can ask your pdr for lithium for your severe depression and ECT if that doesn’t work. But its your choice to improve or not, Drs and ppl won’t hold your hand and guide you, you need to guide yourself."
175919440,"Nope, not today. Either tonight or tomorrow morning though."

175919443,To prevent insomnia you need to wake early at least before 8 AM otherwise you find it difficult to fall asleep at night. Also not take any nap during the day.
174333202,Tomorrow. I asked to have the appointment early because I used to feel like I had to talk to my “friends” no one else could see. So I’d get caught talking to what looked like no one. They might be angels who are there for me. But all the other APs kept them away until Abilify.
175919444,"I have terrible anxiety. The pills I take include Buspirone, Mirtizipane, and prozac. I also take tranqiline, valerian root, and ashwagandha. I used to have 3 anxiety attacks a week now I’m down to an anxiety attack every 2 weeks. The herbs and the pills help but nothing works as good as working out and running. Also stay on a no sugar and low carb diet. Try not to eat candy, chips, chocolate, bread, pasta, or processed food."

175919446,I wouldn’t go unless your a danger to yourself or others. Not a place to be if you can help it
175919447,"One thing that has never recovered for me is the social side of things. This is a massive barrier, and even when I did have ‘friends’, they were not the best people I could have been mixing with on reflection. _PERSON_ goes some way to explaining this, but I don’t just want an explanation. I want a solution so I can get out of this rut that has lasted years. Time will tell how this goes, but I am now content in the fact I will remain single, and friendless probably for the rest of my life."

175919449,"I don’t have voices, but I do get delusional ‘intuition’ that tells me much the same things you talk about experiencing. Choices between the lives of loved ones and my personal growth. Even on my best day this still dogs me. I don’t know if this is good advice or not, but it helps me: I think about how I would like the things I’m after without the negative effects to the other person. That is, simply acknowledging that I don’t want anything bad to happen to person X somehow helps the situation."

174333206,"Higher doses might just bring more side effects without improving positive symptoms. Anyways, its up to your psychiatrist to decide."
175919451,That’s calculus? I never got to do calculus when I was studying engineering. I didn’t finish the course.
175919452,What if all our history and time was created 5 seconds ago in our brain?
175919453,Where does it say that? And why would antipsychotics make you not to lie? I lie and I’m on antipsychotics so it has no effect on anything

175919459,"I dont know if this is a thing, i can say personally im more attracted to either very calm women or either very emotional, and im attracted to no-rules relationships, where i dont have to play by social norms, everyone can say whatever they think, i guess this is what would happen in relationship between disordered people, you just dont have to hide your disorderness anymore, and i also like to get into a rage, if someone sees me as his enemy its easier for me to express my emotions too, because he's my enemy, no rules are applied anymore, thats how i see it, at the same time im careful with my rage becuz i can get physical very quickly, been to jail and didnt like it. Im not a relationship type tho, had some beautiful women interested in me but i dont know what to do, i guess i can't act around cultured people maybe i do need to find a disordered partner of any kind just to be able to get into relationship, i rarely leave my house tho, let along interact with my enviorment"
175919460,Well you know what they say “your results may vary”
175919461,Maybe when you meet the right person you won’t feel insecure with them. Maybe you’ll feel confident and wanted and loved.
175919462,When I look up the uses of both amitriptyline and Cymbalta they both are used for anxiety and depression. To what degree I have no idea. Could I ask what meds would be good for anxiety that anyone knows of? Thanks and God bless

175919467,"I want to feel right, I don’t like these strange sensations I’m having. They are bothering me."
175919468,I had some out the packet now I feel like I’ve been drugged I’m scared im going to die. On a second note do you know about the lime green scooters. My pdoc rode one. The eggs in th newspaper were mocking how I threw some at the police. I’m not a criminal I have no conviction at all My water supply is running low so I’m trying to ratio it. I ain’t mucking around with all this mental manipulation
175919469,"They say mentally ill people better not reproduce i find it very offensive!, i had sex with my girlfriend a year ago now we’re NOT together anymore. it was unprotected this time she wanted it and me too, but before i did what a man did to not make her pregnant because of these worries you know, i don’t want my child to go trough same as I do, I trust in God if it ever comes to that my child would be healthy and not going trough psychiatric abuse and all this ????! Do you think I made a wise action? well i regret my action! im angry at psychiatry very upset right now!"
175919470,I had a pretty good job making more money than I had ever made. I had lots of friends at my job. I was living in my own apartment and had a little garden. I was doing very well for myself. I even was going to the gym regularly. I was in good shape. I try not to think about it. If I think about how I was before I get depressed. I feel like I’m just a shell of what I was
175919471,That sounds like mine because mine got louder with the engine of the tractor
175919472,"Just don’t do it without telling your psychiatrist. In my case I told my psychiatrist and it was a disaster, I nearly killed my brother and myself."

175919476,"Dyspraxia occurs more frequently with those on the spectrum . The report of my autism assessment mentions dyspraxia , but the assessment centre only diagnoses ASD/Asperger’s /autism . I’d need to get another assessment specifically for it, for it to be officially dxed . It wouldn’t increase the level of help and support ,so getting official confirmation is not high on the list of priorities ."

175919477,"Because when you are around I hate the mirror you show me. How do you feel? Can I feel it too? Show me how to feel what you feel so that I can feel something. Why do you stay around? When I do all these things to you. I wanted to feel that you loved me but I have broken you down and when you look at me, with tears in your eyes, I have failed but I had to break you. I told you to stay away. I am better alone."

175919483,"Well now the alcohol made me feel too good to sleep. I was talking to trippers about my benzo withdrawal and someone recommended that I ask my doctor for Tizanidine (I think _NAME_ likes that?) It's a primarily a muscle relaxer. I used the alcohol mainly as a muscle relaxant and if my muscles are relaxed, I don't worry about my heart and don't have anxiety. Idk.. I'm confused.."

175919492,I take resperdal When I’m on YouTube or twitch. I see the chat. When I see the chat username. I believe it’s referring to me. The username predicts what I’m going to be doing in a couple of days. When I go outside I hear things that’s referring to me. So I aoutomatically agree with it. So that’s why I belive the broadcasting thing is real for me as well friend.
175919493,"Well yesterday I just watched Netflix after work until I fell asleep. Today I’ve got a translation gig after work. The older I get, the more grateful I am for coffee, haha. What about you, what do you do to pass the time?"
175919494,"i now realized i am slowing moving to sleep like state, i mean not waking up fully. almost like lucid dream like experience. for running several thoughts we need to wake up fully but in this condition its not happening. previously during daytime i am fully awake and during sleep fully unaware. this huge shift from awareness to unawareness is reducing as years go by instead remaining in between both during day and night and this lack of quality sleep might be causing worsening cognitive issues. may be the inattention spells might be due to mini dozing due to lack of quality sleep."
175919495,"I’ve had ago at knitting , crochet , crocheting a teddy, drawing , digital art , diamond painting , collecting pins, collecting postcards, so much more , oh and photography… I go back and forth on these hobbies sometimes … But sometimes abandon them altogether. My partner feels it’s a manic symptom."
175919496,"Not to be a jerk, but you need to get thicker skin. People are mean, they argue, they’re insensitive. It can’t throw you into flashbacks every time. You need to work on you to get these problems under control. I suggest affirmations and journaling, maybe talking to your therapist about some of those things you’ve been holding back. I know what you’re going through is hard, But life isn’t going to get nicer. You have to get tough."

I once found a dentist that had anxiety worse than I did. He was very calming and patient with me because of it. Also a few of the hygienists I've seen over the years has it too.

175919520,why does a person have it…what is the underlying reason
175919521,"I had a nose surgery 5 days ago and I’m at home now. Surgery took about 2 hours to complete because they found another issue with my breathing problems. It was really painful first few days after surgery as there were tampons in my nose and my eyes were constantly watering. I didn’t throw up after anaesthesia or passed out. I was unable to sleep properly for two days until the tampons were removed. I bled just a little and was able to take a breath even though it is rare to do so. Yesterday I got home and I smoked cigarettes even so my doctor forbade but I’m abstaining from long showers, physical activity, alcohol and coffee. I’m sleeping pretty good now but I feel feeble and weak. My nose stopped bleeding and only comes yellow liquid once in a while. I have to see my surgeon on Monday for a check up and clean my nose from mucus."

Novel antipsychotics were well tolerated by our schizophrenic subjects with OCD, and in 2 subjects, OCD improved on monotherapy with clozapine. We should note that other authors have reported an induction of OCD with clozapine treatment.72 It was our clinical impression that benzodiazepines were particularly effective in treating both catatonic symptoms and akathisia in these subjects."

175919527,"Go with the logical side of your brain. You know deep down it’s right. And for Gods sake either go the hospital, or get with your Pdoc. Your posts over the last days have been scary.

175919528,"The defining criteria are different. Basically sz/psychosis is a syndrome rather than a typical illness. That is to say that it makes little sense to speak of someone having psychosis without displaying the symptoms. I think the same holds for autism, but not entirely sure. Perhaps it is true that a higher rate of autists display psychotic features, i havent heard of it. In any case, that is not what makes for them being autistic."
175919529,"Hmm. You are in a similar situation like me. My doctor is closely watching me to see if I have schizophrenia too. He probably didn’t diagnose you, but he’s closely monitoring your case to see if you have sz."

175919537,Well I dont know if they offer it my guess is probably no. That’s because there are so few cases of it ever reported. It’s very rare causing skepticism that it really exist.

175919539,"Does it help to plan your activities? Like ""read for an hour at 1pm"", ""look into paragliding at 2m"", ""baking school at 3pm"" etc. Give yourself rewards between activities. You can start with a list of activities you want to do."
175919540,"thanks for sharing this. Years ago I was in a medical hospital for a physical illness and they did a CT scan of my brain. When I asked about the results, they only told me, “You have atrophy of the brain…nerve death”…Years later, same scenario only this time I was told that the brain cell death was worsening. When i was in my 20’s I had an IQ above 150. And later in life I had psych testing again and they wouldn’t tell me what my new IQ was but they said there was “evidence of a prodigious intellect that has been harmed by the mental illness”. This is something I am aware of constantly. I struggle now to put sentences together and things that would have been easy for me years ago are hard, if not impossible. I know that i am still intelligent but in terms of practical function…way below where I should be. Again, I don’t know which is SZ and which is another disease overtaking me. Whatever it is…it isn’t good."

174333224,Do any of you think everyone has schizophrenia but not aware they have it?
175919542,Oh no. Hopefully they will be understanding and let you reschedule and not lock you up.
175919543,"Yeah, you are right."
174333222,It’s a syndrome caused by antipsychotics. Antipsychotics may cause symptoms similar to negative symptoms and that’s why a psychiatrist may misdiagnose you with schizophrenia.

I hope you’re not making you’re kids stay inside the house 24/7 over napkins. I agree if you went to the police they would probably think you needed to be in a straight jacket. They don’t really have a full understanding of psychosis, which it sounds like you could be, or you’re headed there. If you saw plastic forks on the ground would you think it’s a sign that everyone wants to fork you? If you saw _PERSON_ on the ground would you think that meant you should go clean your ex’s house?

However in the moment my mind draws a complete blank about doing it . Whether that’s a cognitive issue , or not, I don’t know . It is a long-standing thing though. Dental hygiene is mentioned in notes from the early 80s , and in the recent letter also sent to my GP my dental hygiene is described as poor. As for cleaning the house- I have someone who comes in twice a week to do that. At my ladt place without such help things were not good that way. That was certainly do with executive functioning, and knowing how to proceed with tasks . Getting overwhelmed as to how to proceed definitely leads to avoidance/lack of motivation for me."

Maybe find an alternative … you don’t have to go auschwitz where the sign on the gate declares, “Work Makes You Free”. As saint _NAME_ said, “do what you love and you will not work a day”.

I have had people compare themselves to me and put themselves up as better than me and put me down as a looser. Men and women have done this. Men can be jealous of women too. My last x was jealous of me. I love him as he is sexy ,charming, funny and great in bed but he is a bit of a bad man and I love my other x more. He was jealous that I have a apartment to live in in the area I’m in because he couldn’t afford to live in this area. He hated me for it in a way and that he worked and I didn’t. Don’t need a boyfriend who is jealous of you and compares himself to you. Mainly women compare themselves to me putting themselves as better than me with hate but some men do too. When I was a teen in Onsala the boys called me a ugly wh ore and hurt me and I wonder why they did that. They treated the other girls with respect and love and kindness but me 
with hate and disgust etc I never had a boyfriend in Onsala. No boy would be that brave except one guy called _NAME_ said he thinks I’m pretty he said that to the boys that were calling me ugly.

174333242,"Hello forum I’m back again with small update for my friends here. I have been working on my music and have been taking L-theanine 400Mg and st _NAME_’s wort 400Mg. Pharmaceutical medications have been inebriating me and making me unable to work. This severely pisses me off as even though I am schizophrenic I want to lead my normal life and not feel like a tranquilized drain on society. I hate my prescription meds as I no longer see my comfort hallucinations, but with my new meds I am still having good hallucinations like meep and my DiD who are more level headed and such speak to me and give me advice in life. DISCLAIMER: Please do not take my lifestyle as advice as all of our brains and chemistry are different, what works for me will not work for you for sure okay? I moved to a new apartment and my wife has bought me an electronic drumset, it’s hard to find the time to practice my guitar, bass, drums, and piano because of my being a father and working all the time. I know before I have poste
d about troubles with married life and my schizo-affective and DiD sometimes making my wife’s life hell at times, but she has still stuck through with me and I with her even at our lowest points as we take the vows seriously. I am also trying not to be a low effort low emotion human who is catatonic and quiet and so far it is going way better than it originally was. Number 2 is on the way and I am excited to be a father to more children. As for work I have been trying to relentlessly work and find new jobs and better positions. Retail is a drain on my mind and leaves me unfulfilled. Kitchen work is definitely my forte as my somewhat abrasive personality helps me assert dominance over unruly trashy people and my ability to give nice customer service to those who deserve it makes me an employee above others. I have been taking extra shifts, working doubles, and just being great on the job all the time that by the end of either January or February I will become a supervisor and be running my own shifts like I 
was at my last food/kitchen job. I know for the years I have been posting on the forum I have wanted to make an album but I lack the skills to record and produce solid sound. I may just go the true punk/garage band route and self record everything and try to mix it best I can myself hahahahaa. I have also taken up drawing comics of an original character(s) I made and maybe I’ll pursue and upload to a webcomic site or something of the like. My brother recently visited and showed me tiktok and I originally talked smack about it, but now that he’s showed me how it works and such it’s basically the new vine/youtube although there’s no commercial or monetary gain in it at the moment. I’m liking all the original content and comedic skits I see, but at the same time it’s just too overwhelming with the amount of content that gets created by people around the world 24/7. I’ve met a really good friend at my new job who is a musician as well and is the first in real life who understand where I come from mu

And then came depression and ptsd, narcolepsy…again all dealt with alone…those who were supposed to protect me did not, those who were meant to listen laughed and ignored, those meant to comfort me refused.

I have made SO MANY positive changes and the only thing holding me back now is my obsession with the past. It is ok to grieve over the loss of my childhood to mental illness but it is not ok to let that grief control my life and keep me from enjoying the present and feeling happiness with all that is going for me now. 
From now on I want to focus on making life better and better for me. I want to focus on the present and the future and how much better it will be. I am not alone anymore and I do not have to suffer anymore."

175919666,I hear voices and messages but mine are not critical or negative. I see signs and deeper meanings and symbols all throughout the day but for me it’s reassuring I guess it feels good. Sometimes I’ll ask for signs and I always get them. My voices tell me they are spiritual guides and they talk to me all the time about spiritual things what reality is they help me guide me.

Or Well when the next organisms on earth evolve to humanoids they will be smarter because they could see how the earth messed up this last time. But I don’t think the end times are any time soon. I do believe that we would regenerate smarter and wiser from scratch. Even if 100 humans survived this apocalypse they could start over with the knowledge on how to better not to destroy the earth the next time.

But I don’t know if it’s because of the antioxidant effect or not. Also NAC is supposed to help negative symptoms. Again I don’t know if it’s because of it’s antioxidant activity. NAC didn’t work out for me though. It made abilify less effective. So the only way to know is to try them I guess.

I used to make good money, then sold my business so I had over 3 years of savings. I knew how to be frugal and smart with spending. I have 12k left but now I’m getting back to working. So I personally don’t know what the paycheck to paycheck life is like. It would be stressful I imagine. I think with working full-time and being frugal you can save.

175919721,_AT_MENTION_ one ball nation for the win. I also only have one testicle. It got lost to a testicular torsion. As far as my knob size. It’s shrunk because I’ve gotten fatter. I didn’t think that would be possible. Going to the bone I’m about 3 inches flaccid. I’m 5-6 inches erect. It’s nothing to be impressed by. I look like I have a micro penis flaccid because of all the fat. I found it funny that one of you said you’re not gonna get the chance to use it anyway. That seems like the truth. Haha I’ve never had _NAME_. The only time I did was from an anti depressant. I stopped that real quick. Was that too much info?

175919730,"I vote no, because topics about sex and masturbation are always clearly labelled as being about those things. It is a user’s responsibility not to click on a clearly labelled thread that they know in advance will contain their trigger. TW is more for threads with a surprise topic, like when people make a topic titled “I just remembered something” and in the post they talk about being abused. Someone could click on the “i just remembered something” thread and not be aware they are going to read about abuse, so we add TW abuse to let them know. But if a thread is titled “why I masturbate” and a user is triggered by sexual talk, they have ample warning to mute or ignore that thread without ever reading it."

For dinner I may have roast vegetables or vegan pie with beans or gyoza or something vegan but I eat to much processed food for dinner like pies. Every Friday I get a vegan ice cream and sometimes I allow myself a treat such as I had hot chips from Kentucky fried chicken Monday. I had vegan chocolate yesterday. My sweet tooth and love for junk food has me. I don’t want to give it up but try eating it less often as I’m trying to lose another 2.8 kg.

Now all is done, except taking out all the garbage and 1 more floor. Im a bit relieved. I should have done this years ago and never did, because i felt so overwhelmed.

174333262,"I hate to tell you this but that is a likely scenario. Not everybody has a terrible outcome but you usually know within a few years how it’s likely to go. There are a lot of uncertainties. It’s easy to say just take your meds but they may not be the right meds. Even if they are they may have horrible side effects in the long run and you may not live a long life as a result. Also it’s likely that the positive symptoms of the disease may lessen just to be messed up by the negative symptoms. Plus you may never find a med that completely gets rid of the voices. But it’s not all doom and gloom. A certain percentage of people recover completely. Also if you are still young your body still can function and you can enjoy that part of life more than you think. I took vacations, exercised often, and actually enjoyed life occasionally from my 20’s through my mid 40’s until I relapsed. And the aftermath wasn’t all bad even then. I also in the long run learned to treat the voices the way I wanted 
to be treated by them. Don’t get me wrong it’s not perfect and it took a long time. But it’s much better than it was psychotically even though socially my life is in the toilet."

175919778,"I’m personally someone who will try to see the intention behind what someone is saying; knowing that they mean well is more important than the words they say. However, a lot of what people say can be stigmatizing without them realizing it or can be hurtful to those of us with Bipolar Disorder. A few things not to say are included below: 1. ‘ is so Bipolar’ Don’t say that the weather is so Bipolar, don’t say that your mood is so Bipolar, don’t say that someone else is so Bipolar: basically don’t use Bipolar as a descriptive word. It’s a mental illness, it’s not a word to be laughed about or used to describe something else in your day to day life. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-journey/2019/06/5-things-not-to-say-to-someone-with-bipolar-disorder/"

175919786,"You’re proyecting. There is a back story to today’s events, one involving my judgment of one of the moderator’s intellectual fitness to moderate this forum. Today 2 moderators have attacked from the self-same angle: my alleged (or real!) intellectual inadequacies. Revenge pure and simple on part of the mini-power that be. _PERSON_ as that. On a more personal level treebeard didn’t appreciate me debunking his simplistic and moralistic nostrums, so he took the road most travellled: name-calling."
175919787,What also scares me is my ex-boyfriend was in the news he worked for someone who was involved with the _PERSON_ and this man who I met killed himself.

175919797,Thanks a bunch. I think I can manage that if it lasts me a month. The only thing is I’m currently saving extra for a PC I plan on getting next month. The other thing that’s holding me back is my sister’s visit. I’ll want to save for her visit as well. I definitely could fit it in my budget next month. I just want to know if a bottle like that would last me for a monthly supply?

175919817,"https://www.calculator.net/half-life-calculator.html?type=1&nt=&n0=0&t=0&t12=0&x=75&y=21 You can do an experiment on that calulator if you want. Put 100 in “inital quantity” (100mg dose), 24 in “time” (time passed since last dose), 12 in “half-life” (12h half-life assumed in this example) Press Calculate, and you get the result that after 24h has passed the “quantity remains” = 25(mg) Each time after you press calculate, add the “quantity remains” to the current value in the “inital quantity” box. Now “initial quanity” = 100+25, so put 125 in the “initial quantity” box. Press Calculate. “quantity remains” = ~31(mg). Add another dose (100mg) to that, so you’ll put 131 in the “initial quantity” box. Press Calculate. “quantity remains” = ~33(mg). Add another dose (100mg) to that, so you’ll put 133 in the “initial quantity” box. Press Calculate. “quantity remains” = ~33(mg). As you can see, the quantity of the drug in your system (“quantity rema
ins”) won’t increase any more, it will level out. If you keep taking 100mg of the drug every day, the amount in your blood keeps fluctuating between 133mg (just after taking a dose) and 33mg (just before taking the next dose). In this example I used approximation (~ sign), so actually the amount will keep increasing in your system, but the increase will be so small (and will get even smaller after every 24 hours) it can be ignored. This again assumes 100% bioavailability (100% of the drug enters your blood and nothing gets lost in digestion, etc). If the bioavailability is less, put the actual value - for example 60mg - in the “initial quantity” box. Every time 60mg + “quantity remains” will be put in the “initial quantity” box."

She has to stay away from certain foods, and she got it in her thirties. The pain had her in tears. Her oxycontin prescription is the only thing that lets her function. She never takes them out of turn or shows any signs of an addict. She doesn’t alter them, give them away, or anything like that. She just takes them when she’s supposed to and goes on. I’ve always had back pain, but in contrast to my mom’s situation, it’s not bad enough to warrant pain killers. It’s not debilitating, I mean.

175919927,"Loneliness is different than being alone. Loneliness is when someone feels abandoned or sad due to isolation. Alone is when you are by yourself. You need to remind yourself that you matter, and that you love yourself, and have worth. Because you could go out with a bunch of friends and still feel loneliness. It’s important to remind yourself that you love yourself and that you’re here and you get to experience the gift of life. I hope you get to feelin’ better. Best wishes."
175919928,"My classes are done long distance now - which I like. I feel much better away from the majority of them. Unfortunately, I withdrew from one of my academic electives. I'm not liking other current situations. I'm being treated disrespectfully by a chick (A) I got along with before - until I started distancing myself due to trying to handle my own issues (already mentioned that a while ago) - and the fact that another chick (B) (who's been going down the line to find issue with people the whole time during this program, but when she got to me, I just withdrew because I didn't want to deal with her) suddenly became ""buddy-buddy"" with ""A."" I backed off even further - I've had enough experiencs with triangulation and I know both are gossipy and $#%^ talk people. I don't care if I'm making assumptions or ""fortune telling"" or being paranoid - it's not worth risking the hassle. As much as I got along with ""A,"" she hasn't had enough life experience or tragedy to understand crisis. For a while now, sh
e's punishing whenever she gets a chance, but smiles and is friendly and acts like everythings good between us. I admire her ability to be so fake and so convincing at the same time (that is, until I get a little dig here and there). She'd brag about being that way, but I thought she was just puffing herself up. I've probably caused some hurt for her as well when I was trying to keep a handle on my own issues. People didn't believe that I had been struggling (or were disinterested in the fact) and that's why I'd stopped going to a lot of my classes. They thought I was just slacking off. I've also been doing the full home isolation thing for a while now due to some symptoms which is fine, but I've needed to ask for help a few times. Having to rely on others is one the worst things for me to go through. Recently, I asked a different chick (C) if she was going to the store. She said no and I said fair enough, and tried to change the subject. She asked if I don't go out at all. I said not lately, I've had to do t
he self isolation thing (She knows this. I've said it before more than once). She talked about it as if I was pretending and said maybe it would do me good to get out. She doesn't even hide that she thinks I'm pretending. I was offended and stated I'd love to and she was right. It would be great. For me. but it may not be beneficial for others and that I'm fighting something off or I'm low grade sick (although it may not be this particular virus) and I listed the relevant symptoms I have that seem to come and go (mild difficulty breathing/tight airways, sore throat, dizziness, and chills) and that it's suggested to self-quarantine just in case. She continued to act like I was exaggerating. I know her well enough to know she might use this as an opportunity to go around saying I got mad at her because she wouldn't help me, so I continued to hit home that I'd rather be doing $#%^ on my own without help and trying to end our conversation. I was bordering on being retaliative. I realized shortly after that I'm no
t skilled enough in that type of behaviour to come out looking decent in this. She's an attention seeker and drama person (but is kind of a sweetheart behind it) so I can see why she'd assume I'm pretending. She is close to B. I've always shut down her desire to $#%^ talk others around me as much as possible and she's respected it. Person A used to $#%^ talk B & C all the time. Shortly after person B buddied up to person A, person A and C got close too. Knowing the way they all are, I'm sure they've talked about me plenty. Person B is realizing I was actually quite ###$ up over things and feels guilty and is currently sucking up to me. I continue to stay back because I've learned this is a cycle for her. She flip-flops. I wonder if this is common behavior: if you have a major issue with someone, they suddenly try to get close to the person you're closest to. It's happened to me a couple times before. Even though it's not my style, I've been wondering if it's worth being vengeful and trying to punish back for 
the problems they've caused me. This place I live has taught me that being decent doesn't pay. I can't wait to go back to my old city. I'm so close to done this semester, I'm trying not to blow up my bridges, but there are little fires sprouting up. Even if it's only for the self-based motive of remembering that was my original goal, I'm probably just going to keep my head down and fight off the desire to get even. I would also like to not displace my anger anywhere else including here. Also, I'm hearing people say ""things will never be the same even after this virus ends,"" but I believe we'll all go back to having our heads up our asses very soon after."

As she has an episode, it gets worse. She will yell at the top of her lungs and kick me out of the room and cry so much where I get frustrated because I do not know what to do. I try and tell her to listen for my voice and I remain calm but I think that just rattles her up even more. If anyone has any supporting words, thoughts or ideas that would help a lot. I have been feeling very guilty and miserable, which I feel guilty for. I shouldn't feel this way, right?

174333290,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Course of Psychosis in Schizophrenia With Alcohol Use Disorder: A Post Hoc Analysis of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness in Schizophrenia Phase 1 Study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, MS _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of clinical psychiatry, Mar 2020 17 Patients with schizophrenia and comorbid alcohol use disorder remain understudied. This post hoc analysis evaluated data from Phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness in Schizophrenia study (January 2001-December 2004).Patients without substance abuse (except marijuana use) in the month before study entry were categorized into those with a history of alcohol use disorder (SZ + AUD) within 5 years before study entry and those without alcohol use disorder (SZ-only) per DSM-IV criteria. Time to first and recurrent exacerbations and hospitalizations were compared between disease states and between olanzapine and perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, and zipras
idone.A total of 1,338 patients (SZ + AUD = 22.6%; SZ-only = 77.4%) were included. Time to first exacerbation of SZ was significantly shorter in the SZ + AUD versus SZ-only population (median = 5.4 vs 6.4 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.20 [95% CI, 1.01-1.42]; P = .039). Similar findings were observed for first hospitalization (HR = 1.63 [95% CI, 1.20-2.22]; P = .002) and recurrent hospitalizations (HR = 1.60 [95% CI, 1.18-2.15]; P = .002). The most common reasons leading to exacerbation in both groups were an increase in symptom severity and lack of efficacy. In patients with SZ + AUD related or unrelated to marijuana, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone were associated with significantly shorter time to first exacerbation versus olanzapine.This post hoc analysis confirmed that patients with SZ + AUD had a worse illness course than patients with SZ-only and suggests that olanzapine may be associated with a longer time to first and recurrent exacerbations versus other antipsychotics in this d
ifficult-to-treat population. Further research is needed to identify effective treatments for this important yet understudied patient population.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT_PHONE_NO_."

My father suffered from depression all his life & I’m so like him in many ways I was molested by a doctor from ages 9- 12. I began to medicate myself at age 10, angry, lonely (but had lots of ‘friends’). At 15, I was beaten & raped. I’ve only told a few people about the molestation, the rape is my secret. I’ve always been a very hyper person, much like an anxious terrier. People, even total strangers tell me all their troubles , but not one person asks how I’m doing. I feel lost & cut adrift. My life was getting so much better in the several years before Covid. I was taking better care of myself for the first time in my life. Then Covid happened, furloughed from work till June, now working excessively. The masks give my some kind of weird vibe, so I avoid going anywhere but work. Insomnia has increased to the point of only having three or four hours of sleep. So I st

174333303,"I feel stupid right now! Sometimes that can happen…it’s not the end of the world I don’t think. I’m coming back from benzodiazepine withdrawal. It’s only been a month and a half. It was bad. It’s a work in progress. I was manic for several months. I want to spend the rest of the year recovering my memory. Thinking can be hard, getting on antipsychotics like haloperidol immediately, I would imagine, would be a tool in bringing mania to baseline. Still, I want to start rebuilding my memory, as I suffer from different forms of amnesia and memory impairment. Both long and short term. I think getting on stable Haldol might hamper that process. Rather, I want to bring down the mania, then maintain with something on reserve. Haldol is a great medication which I’ve never tried. It’s an antipsychotic, I’ve never tried a typical (older gen.) antipsychotic. I’ve tried most atypical antipsychotics. My intrusive thoughts, a manifestation of OCD, were hellish on all of them! Additionally, dep
ression is something I would like to avoid at all costs. A reemergence of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in me, symptoms which I suffered with for years, would be very demoralizing for me right now. I want to continue rebuilding my memory/cognition. Stopping the mania, for one would help…and if Trileptal can’t offer that, I think Haldol would be a better option than Seroquel."

175920017,"Diagnostic inconsistency is all too common . Even my current pdoc ,who’s thoroughly decent, has been prone to it. 2018 -1st appointment - schizophrenia and ASD fit best 2019- Changed from schizophrenia to schizoaffective based on further exploration that indicated I’d had low and high moods,while concurrently experiencing psychotic symptoms. 2020- ‘In the context of a diagnosis of Autistic spectrum disorder, now having been made and the depressive symptoms being mild when they occurred in the past,I’m changing the diagnosis back to schizophrenia.’"

174333308,"_PERSON_ and colleagues reported that psychotic experiences were genetically associated with MDD, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and ADHD. Also, analyses of polygenic risk scores indicated correlations between psychotic experiences and genetic liability for MDD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and ADHD."
175920019,"The Wikipedia link poster strikes again. Merit is a real thing in my line of work. If you’re useless you get chewed up and spit out. I’ll be one of the people doing the chewing, so get your poop in a group and get the work done or get the hell out of my way – those are your choices. Law of the jungle, baby."
175920020,That’s eerie. I think I feel the same way. I don’t think it’s a healthy way to be though. Actually it’s clearly not healthy. I suspect a lot more people here feel like that.
175920021,"My soon to be ex wife couldn’t believe it when I was first diagnosed, and we’ve been together for over 20 years. Neither did my friends. They dismissed my diagnosis as “outlandish”. Admittedly I feel confused at times, but that’s to be expected when you run perilous thought-experiments tinged by existential concerns."
175920022,"I certainly feel a loss. My cognition wasn’t what it was, and that makes me feel very depressed in a way. I used to feel like i could do anything i set my mind to, now i feel like i have limits. I get very exhausted after work for example, trying to act normal and focus all day long.

175920026,"Once, I was so impulsive that you almost have to call it psychosis, and I smashed a couple of windows with my fist. One other time, being erotomanic, I e-mailed a woman (thinking she was in love with me) daily and was eventually accused of threatening her. I feel more embarrassment than remorse, but I do regret these episodes. -_NAME_."

175920028,Does thorazine help at all for anxiety BB I know at lower doses it's sometimes used for that
175920029,"For me before my first psychosis everytime I won over psychosis and broke my delusions, new worse ones appeared. I became suicidal at the end and tried to kill myself in a car accident before the overdose suicide. It just gradually got worse and worse, I couldn’t fight it psychologically anymore. I was exhausted. It went too far and too extreme killing myself to prove that I am Jesus. I wish it had stopped getting worse before going too extreme."
175920030,"Your mother isn’t “in a spin” if you’ve quit your medications cold turkey that’s serious harm to you, and they need to take into account your ability to do rash things. That said, I’m not your mom, I’m some bloke on the internet so what you do ultimately falls on you, and you don’t need me hounding you. Be polite, be specific about what you want to have happen, have concerns. Here’s how I’d go about it, maybe give it a look over. So these people are there to help you, don’t try to “trap them” just tell them that you think you’re on too high a dose, if you’ve begun to regularly take your medicine and have a higher compliance now then before, mention that. Say that you’re getting the medicine into your system and the pro-whats-it level concerns you. Tell them that you have trouble thinking and that, that distresses you and makes you want to lower the dose to see if it will help. That without clearer thinking you feel you will stop complying with medicating. You’ve so
ught advice from other’s and they agree that lowering the dose might be helpful for the trouble thinking, and you’re wanting to taper to a lower dose. Its the truth from what I’ve read. I’ve never not had my medical team not agree to try something when I’ve asked, so I don’t know if I’m just better off, or if I’m just doing this as well as it can be handled."

175920036,"I experience intense anger any time I’m coming off any antipsychotic. I don’t get physically violent, but I do get emotionally violent, which is just as bad. There is often a little voice telling me it might be different if I come off my ap this time. I take Geodon, Seroquel, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Omega 3, L-theanine, B vitamins, and naproxen. I also take caffeine pills, but I had drank ten cups of coffee a day for 45 years, so it has little effect on me. These med’s keep me stable.

I think that I wasnt fine on the atarax, zeno… I was paranoid for hours, not calm at all and cant even moving for hours… I have the same reaction on every possible antidepressant… What to do? If klonopin helps a bit, why not every day as my friend does it? Ok, it doesnt heal my negatives, but it helps my paranoia and the excitement and the anxiety… I have a terrible headache now from the atarax, I cant live like that… You think too, that I am not dying despite my nausea and the long isolation from the years?? Sorry to ask you, but lately I have this fear and it was worse today on the atarax…"
175920045,Saw Dr and talked long and hubby spoke to him too. I’d been whatsapping him over the last week or two when I felt so bad and he said the best for me is to go to hospital and transfer to the government psych hospital and get new meds there otherwise I’d keep on having to come see him over and over within the next few months and it would cost me more he said. So he wrote a referral letter to the general hospital. I’m a bit scared but maybe if I can see how the weekend goes…and maybe I don’t need to go at all…hubby says maybe I can cope and feel better…I just wanna die maybe it would solve a lot of problems. …but I’m such a f-ing coward I can’t even cut properly let alone slit my wrist and I fear death as well f-ing coward I am…but hey?maybe I will be ok try to be positive. My husband needs me for helping him with business now.I can’t afford to be in hospital and hey?maybe my crisis is over…

175920047,"_AT_MENTION_ I don’t think you’re a failure, inept or stupid. I think you’re good at some things and not as good at other things. That’s true of all of us, at least it is if we’re being honest with ourselves.

174333311,"It’s been two months since your psychosis honestly give it some time. You can’t expect miracles. It will probably get better. I hated these pills as well in the beginning now I’m gratefull they exist. But i never really had too much negative symptoms though only in a full blown episode. Abilify shouldn’t give you this effect it doesn’t block your dopamine totally, it has a blocking effect in the striatum where the dopamine is overactive and a boosting effect in the rest of the brain where it’s underactive. Try to take them for at least 6 months, to stay stable. godspeed"
175920053,"Thanks for clearing that up, I’ll ask my pdoc about it because I’ve been severely depressed since before my diagnosis two years ago. I cant remember the last time I havent been depressed. Oh well, they’re just labels I guess."

175920061,"_NAME_,I’m so sorry to hear this.... it is hard when your mind does not collaborate. But please remember - my therapist told me this one day - it is your thoughts only. You are not your thoughts. Try and ignore them. Hard to do I know when u are in it. I assume u are on meds. Maybe not the right ones... but it’s your neurotransmitters playing a trick on you. Once your .evils are balanced out you can think straight again.... the husband room mate situation does not help... do u have any other way to get support?? Or call a help line and start talking. Even the Good Samaritans have a help line. See what u can do. You are most certainly NOT alone Big hugs _PERSON_"

175920062,I voted for _NAME_ but what I love are the popcorn balls. I already bought two bags of them from Walmart. Will get some more before they sell out.
175920063,Paranoia ruled my life for way too long. My paranoia was about conversations. I studied talking and communication and that just taught me other ways to get isolated. I’d be worried why people said one word. It would prey on my mind but the result was the same. Take the pills. If your still struggling let your treatment team know. It’s the only sound strategy. Navy Seals are doing extreme shite every day . They aren’t after a nice person in the community. Paranoid delusions are hard to overcome but you can get there. I got there. It took me some med changes to get it right so it’s always worth fighting for that better function. Have a chat to your shrink!
175920064,Don’t be worried about getting what you need. Its amazing that you are able to work at all with this illness. I hope things work out.

175920067,Ok. That’s a good reason to go. It’s also a reason to tweak your meds a bit so you don’t go into the depths of despair
175920068,I am 42 but I forget my age sometimes.
174333329,"I still got mind reading on risperidone though. Abilify is the only antipsychotic that really helped me though, but I hate Abilify, if you know what I mean. But I have friends on risperidone that do really well on it, so it’s different for everyone"

175920071,"I’ve had periods of much pressure in my head that coincided with insomnia. It could be that your brain is inflamed. I used anti-inflammatory herbs which I took as tea to help me. You might want to try for example garlic, onion, turmeric, sarsparilla. All berries are good too, like blueberry and raspberry. They might not all work on you but experiment and try to pay attention if some of them lessens the pressure and then you got a new herbal or berry friend. If it doesen’t get better you should tell your doctor."

I hallucinated the people on the radio (in my car) laughing at me while I was going to a job (I was in IT) and had a strong urge to escape from my life. I remember driving (wildly) 30km out of town then turning around and coming home. No-one got hurt but I think I scared at least one other driver. Don’t drive and psychosis, kids!

174333328,I mean that is unfortanate your symptoms progressed. and it happens to people with bipolar too. honestly the whole segregated symptom dx’s should be thrown out. it would make way more sense to have some sort of Mental illness disorder and different levels according to symptoms instead of so many different names. thus the evolving world of psychiatry lol

175920109,He was better at and more interested in raising children than I was. It made a strange relationship.
175920110,_AT_MENTION_ what you’re writing is completely delusional. And what makes you think a hospital in another country try will give you an MRI without your medical records? They don’t just give out MRIs for the asking. And if they get your records they will know you’re delusional and probably lock you up in a sub-par mental hospital. Who’s to say they will let you out? You need help. You need to take your meds or go to the hospital for help right now. There is no microchip! You’re very sick and the longer you put off treatment the more damage is possibly happening to your brain. The next step is full blown psychosis and forced hospitalization.

174333341,"I met D on a farm. I was introduced by a friend who thought I might be able to get some marijuana. We ended up spending time in a hamock the three of us. D and I ended up kissing. Our friend fell in a pond on the way back from the hammock. Over her head. I had to reach in and pull her out. We quickly ended up involved. I thought when I kissed her she was maybe 37 or 38 not much older than the previous woman I was involved with was. But she ended up telling me she was 48. She was a blonde. We went for a walk the day after the night we spent together. We walked off into the forrest and ended up walking and talking until we hit the highway of another town. She told me she was worth three million in the bank. It didn’t mean much to me the money. She convinced me to move to the city with her. We hired a _NAME_ and rode the three hours to the city. I don’t think I said a word the entire way. As soon as we hit her apartment I walked in and there was a bar on her counter. I poured myself a drink. We la
id in bed and she read me her favorite childhood book. I should have begun to fall in love but there was a relationship from my youth that left me a little cold inside. There was a night in the city when we went to a bar and watched a concert, drank and danced. We missed the train, it stopped at 2 am. So we walked the whole way home to her building. No one on the streets. I switched shoes with her because they were hurting her feet. That was a romantic night. We talked the whole way home. I began to drink. At night I’d sit and listen to music with my whiskey and watch prisoners play basketball in the jail across the street. She had a heck of a book collection. I admired that. Now I am going on to amass one myself. I read one…a book about Soviet gulags mostly in the bathroom. We liked to cook together. Put some music on and cook dinner. We lived together for five or six months. In the morning we read the New York Times, a mutual interest of ours. We watched tv at night in bed. I was starting to fall in lov
e. We went house shopping on the coast. I think she cried in front of the realtor and I went on about The Children of the Revolution, simply a song but what I thought of as a group from my past. I should have fallen in love. We both desperately wanted to fall head over heals in love. I guess I did fall in love with her though. We took a vacation up north. More of a trip really. I remember drinking wine and watching The Man With the Golden Arm, an old black and white movie on tv at night. We stayed at this old motel and in the pouring rain had a cab driver pick us up bottles at the liqour store. We stayed in hotels here and there. We drank in bars. I had gotten quiet and I know she was trying to understand me. There were crying fits. She was bi-polar. I had told her I had depression and anxiety but didn’t tell her about my schizoaffective diagnosis. There was this ship that we stopped to look at and when we were there a car drove up and as I was walking back to the car the guy turned and said “I know you
 and there was some wierdness about the port authority. When I was young we somehow ended up on a freighter. I think this was the port authority guy. Well anyway, I got quiet and she became unstable. I would wake up to her standing over me and staring at me. Not a good way to start the day. She eventually kicked me out one morning with two paper bags of my stuff. I hit the liqour store and drank liqour in my coffee and watched the ferrys come and go. I took a bus back to my home town. I wish things had ended differently. _PERSON_ earlier introduced her to my parents she bought them a bottle of wine and we went out for chinese food. She talked to them about her deceased fathers life. I don’t know what to think here. She ended up dying somehow several years ago. I missed the funeral. I wished I’d have known about it. I really do. We lost touch. That will always be left unfinished. What we could talk about these days. We could reconcile. Really sucks. Very sad. Sorry for such a long post. In memory of _PERS

Maybe this had something to do with it: I worry about things before they happen so when/if they do, I've already begun to rationalize the situation. Maybe I'm a Vulcan. Dx envy. I was going to tell her that but what's the point."

175920252,"I mean, I sort of did that I got tired of being told I was BPD, when that obviously wasn’t what was going on. It took me awhile to find a pdoc that didn’t think that I was faking symptoms for attention and actually put me on an AP"

Theres a lot of energy that can be unleashed. Just take the time to do stuff for yourself, and things will get easier. Don’t set high expectations because you’ll just disappoint yourself. It’s when we don’t set any expectations is when we achieve the most"

175920259,"I noticed a mental decline maybe 4 years before onset, I was having a hard time listening to auditory directions. I thought maybe it was just because I was new to working and it was stress ful and some people learn differently, but I think it was literally just me having trouble comprehending auditory directions. My short term memory was a little wonky then, and I think its about the same now. I now have trouble using my imagination, things I could imagine with crisp clarity before are now only sort of like clouded impluses of desire for that shape. Not the thing I could sculpt in my mind before. My dreams are still there though, and for a few moments each night I can sculpt what I want out of them before I become fully awake. Then its all ruined. Reading books is a little harder, I can’t bear a lot of the emotional stress they put on you, and I have to have breaks. Its difficult accepting, but it is what it is, and I make do. Part of it is the medication part of it is schizophrenia, part of it i

175920265,I don’t believe in hating. I don’t think it’s good for us. I believe in forgiveness or disliking and avoiding them as you don’t accept the way they treat you. I don’t think I hate but I do dislike some people who have done disgusting malicious things to me .
175920266,That’s good. I would like a little more feedback and advice from my pdoc if possible.

175920287,"So I only seem to get sleep paralysis and auditory hallucinations when I sleep at his house. I have never gotten auditory hallucinations so frequently and intensely as I have at his house. No idea why. They are all when I am half asleep thus are not psychotic hallucinations. It is a very terrifying experience when it occurs. It’s not just sleep paralysis I get it’s this weird state where I feel I am sedated and can’t wake myself up no matter how hard I try, I just keep waking into another dream. The hallucinations can be quite scary, I have heard roaring, and often a man talking. Last night I woke up from a dream into another dream where I audibly heard a man narrating the ending of the dream I just woke up from. It startled me intensely and I was panicking in the dream and my boyfriend was trying to comfort me. When the voice finally stopped I looked and saw ghostly creepy looking faces made out of steam on the windows…then I woke up for real. However that state I was in I must have been i
n my half asleep state because it is so weird it feels like reality but a muffled version. Like I can feel the bed and vaguely make out things around me but don’t have my full senses. It made me wonder today if I wasn’t experiencing some alternate reality where my psychosis was much more severe. These experiences are just unsettling all around. It makes me thing about the nature of consciousness and it’s different forms."

175920298,"I do have this to a certain extent. I am able to vaguely visualize things in my head but it takes a great effort and doesn't come naturally. Also, I find that words don't trigger images for me like they would most people. For example, someone says ""pink elephant"" and I either don't think of anything or I see an extremely vague image of a pink elephant. I really have to force myself to visualize the pink elephant. I find this has got worse since I developed Depersonalization Disorder as my mind is even foggier now as a result. This kind of ties into the whole ""am I a sociopath"" thing because of my lack of emotional reaction to emotionally charged words like rape and murder etc, which I understand is a symptom of psychopathy."

Your catatonia sounds more pervasive and worse than mine, so you may require benzos, but it’s worth a shot."

We texted some yesterday on the holiday (Memorial Day) and I told her a little more. This morning she asked me how I was feeling which I wasn't completely honest because she said she was more worried about me and that made me feel bad. I texted two of my friends yesterday but they didn't text back. I'm worried that I am overwhelming them so I'm not going to text them for a while. Or if I do, it's just gonna be a ""hi, how are you?"" sort of text. Nothing deep. I talked to Pastor _PERSON_ last night. We are still going to go every two weeks. He said if I see him every week I have to have more goals to work on and I don't have them. I just have the one big one. So I'm not going to like make stuff up just to talk to him more so it's every other week right now. That's how often I speak to Regular T too. I don't know. I don't even think it matters.

Then 20 min after I woke up I had another one. Might as well stay asleep all day. Thank god for these days off work even tho I won’t be paid. I got backup money. It’s just...between my dad being elderly and having to work in a grocery store (he’s at risk for covid), and my fiancé too plus my fiancés new heart issues....and me pretty much losing 600 a month income for awhile....I’m stressed beyond anything. I haven’t been this stressed since my dad had his stroke back in 2013. The panic attacks stopped for like 3 or 4 days and now they are back. I’m scared and not well right now with my mental health. Anxiety, so much. And my voices are back even I just got my dosage raised like 2 or 3 weeks ago. No delusions I think."

175920323,"Hello everyone, Still in the hospital. Going up and down. I have some insight but it’s wavering badly. To think logically and rationally is really taking it out of me and stressing me out. Acting “normal” so to speak. My therapist saw right through it though and said I’m not well yet. I agree. It’s tough. I’m afraid to go home cause of the demons there. They scare me...they really really do. And the thought of going home and handling myself during the day when my wife is at work...is utterly terrifying. I’m so not ready for this. Can I curl up in a ball and hide somewhere?"

175920331,Hopefully you feel better soon. Sleep is important huh. I try to get the same amount of sleep every day. I usually sleep 10 hours more or less and that is good amount for me. I only sleep a bit less when I have to go to the pdoc.

175920339,I feel tired and depressed. This is the time of night when I would normally play my game. But I feel so bad that I can't do it. The thought of playing is making me sad.

175920340,Not about me just a thread asking for opinions in general
175920341,Yeah I’ll see how it goes at 3mg. Hopefully my pdoc will be on board with this. She has been very reluctant to lower my dose since my hospitalization 4 years ago.
175920342,Ok. I followed a how to video on YT of how to clean the metal bowl under the coil.
174333372,"Its kind of a test, he diagnosed me with “mood disorder”, unknown yet. He says if it makes me feel better and more stable that would be good, but if im actually bipolar it will bring it out and he will be able to accurately diagnose me, because its uncertain. He ruled out schizoaffective and bipolar 1, but he didnt rule out bipolar 2, hes unsure if its depression or bipolar.

175920361,There are at least two cameras in your cell phone. Some have more. Why would you need one implanted? I get it though. I used to think they were all over my house. When I was outside I thought they were watching me with satellites. When I went to the hospital the first time I was so paranoid that I pointed to the visible cameras in there and said cameras. I was in the military. My commanding officer came to visit me and when we got done chatting he pointed to the camera in the room and said cameras. He was an ???????. Making fun of me. I am not making this up. It really happened.

Secondly what you've described there is classic NLP cloak and dagger mind games that accompany this **** show as they can be any thing from Gaslighting, adopting modern forms of control and intimidation like Zersetzung, and smear campaigns via Snapchat or hired proxy. Triggering & Anchoring can be applied to get you to act out in public, also if you are a 'voice' hearer this could be achieved by electronic harassment which is now being investigated as a form of human trafficking networks or abuse rings. by the UN . Thses are just some of whats about to change things."

174333382,"Sometimes I think if they think psychosis or think you have voices, they just slap a label of shcizophrenia on you sometimes. Maybe they should consider other diagnosises on the schizophrenia spectrum or other similar disorders. Like, I think I may be schizotypal and not really schizophrenic these days. And, i definetly think my depression hasn’t been treated adaquatly. Maybe they aren’t asking the right questions and digging deep enough sometimes."
175920368,"It sounds like maybe you have excess energy right now. If you could run on the treadmill for a little while, hopefully these impulses will stop."
175920369,There is no late onset… I just felt ignored and signs were missed
175920370,"No, you arent alone. And that in turn makes me feel better. Cause this illness can make you feel absolutely alone in the experience."
174333376,Nope but I had several full blown episodes of psychosis but never got the sz or sz affective diagnosis. They said it’s bipolar cuz I’m too high functioning. This leads me to believe the diagnosis process is very imperfect because some days I am absolutely not high functioning
175920371,"Your brain is bombarded with unnatural chemicals. It needs to be reset. Call your doc for guidance. While you have their ear, ask them about light therapy. Basically, you point this device at your face for 30-45 minutes early every morning. It duplicates the sun’s effect on your brain, and resets the area that controls the sleep/wake cycle (aka circadian rhythm), and by the end of the day, your brain should be dumping melatonin naturally. Light therapy is very quick, usually working to realign your sleep naturally in a couple days, at most."
175920372,I’ll take the advice _AT_MENTION_ I’ll be back in a few days
175920373,"LS! For the last eight months my weight stayed at 300lbs 135 kilo, even though I was trying to lose weight. But my abdominal girth was 6 centimeters less down from 151 to 145 centimeters. Apparently the strength training gave me more muscle. It is very motivating!"

175920478,Mine is a bit complicated to explain but I will try. In my psychosis period I used to watch youtube videos and think that there are thousands of influential people connected with me and I send them messages through watching videos and hitting pause/play buttons to emphasize on a certain dialogue as my message and that’s how I communicated with people. This belief I am totally out of and completely shaken off but there is still a part of it that still believe is real. That part is: Sometimes while watching videos the youtube screen used to by it self pause play the dialogues like the existence/god whatever is trying to communicate back to me. And it’s not buffering because it never stops the video for even one second. So I will never know what was happening… For example in the Black panther movie teaser there is a dialogue where black panther’s father says “you are a good man with a good heart…” … The video itself pause played it for a nano second emphasizing on that dialogue to commu
nicate back to me… So this I will never know what happened there… And there are many such incidents.

175920485,This was the first doctor I had who finally listened to me that my bladder issues started with zoloft. He said he believed that the zoloft somehow caused damage to or otherwise messed with the nerves that normally suppress the bladders urge to go unless it’s really full. I believe this as I was on an incredibly high dose and I am so sensitive to psych meds that I believe it could have definitely done damage to my body. Anyways he said that was an issue combined with me having a very small bladder. He said the normal adult bladder holds about 20 oz and mine holds 8. So it’s like my bladder stayed a kid bladder and didn’t grow with me (my mom jokingly said I needed a bladder transplant). So I’m on myrbetriq which helps a lot but I had a really bad flare up lately so it’s not working quite perfectly so he added a small dose of amytryptaline which is supposed to help too. Wish me luck!!
174333390,"I thought I was abducted by aliens and went to outer space. I came back months or years later and realized or thought or was told or felt all humans are actually ??????? aliens lol. I’m not kidding. I was so paranoid and scared and had panic attacks when I came back. Not sure how it all worked. Felt like I went to mars for some time. I don’t know or remember much. Felt like a VR headset or hologram. But the tech is light years ahead of anything I know. Like I had theories of time dilation and philosophical zombies and crap and the whole 9 yards as they say. I remember watching TV and thinking all the players on the TV (football) were actually aliens and I was from another freaking planet or came back from space. I don’t know if this is against forum rules, but that’s how I felt. I don’t know if it was a different life. I really don’t know why I felt like I did. I can’t remember much. I don’t think I’ll ever really move on or recover. Like I told my mom (she remembers) that I felt 
like people were following me and I couldn’t tell what was real after I smoked pot back in 2011. This all happened in college. Like I don’t even remember actually going to college like I experienced soul transfer or are from a different planet or time line or experienced time travel. I watch a lot of conspiracy theories to try and understand and figure out what the ???? happened to me. It’s possible I was abducted by grey aliens – the evil type. Not sure why. I think we are just in their ??????? evil simulation and are like cattle or ants to them. Some are fortunate and others like me are just animals for lack of a better word… In a past life, I remember them asking me about simulation theory like how do they escape like they told me they can travel between simulations but MIGHT be stuck – I don’t know. Maybe they escaped. I know I did. Some of them don’t like them and seem to have more powers than others. I feel like some greys have infinite knowledge that spans eternity like a video game or 
sims game. Hopefully, it’s all a lie because simulation theory sucks. It’s possible I got abducted by real aliens, but I suspect I could have implanted or false memories or maybe even had some milab experience. It feels so weird like it never happened but in a past life. Like I dropped out in 2011 but felt like I reincarnated in this life in 2013 – I guess. Like I woke up or came through a portal and gained sentience. I guess and think a lot. Like I said, I’ll never recover or heal. I just like getting this garbage out. It’s possible time is non-linear, doesn’t exist, or is multi-dimensional. I thought I was in mk-ultra, monarch, montauk, and secret space program, but I don’t know. Maybe it’s all fake and made up and I was just an alien abductee. It’s pretty nuts to say and think I’m truly immortal in a cosmological sense. If we live in the sims, it would make sense how information is inserted into the computer program or video game just like the sims game. At this point, I don’t really 
know what the hell or how the heck _PERSON_ effect works, I just know it exists and is very, very real. It’s possible I’m time traveling while sleeping and going into different dimensions or remembering them from eons ago while I’m sleeping since I remember nothing really. It’s like time doesn’t exist, really for lack of a better word. I think the brain is quantum basically so it’s all possible but might be 100+ years ahead of our understanding. What I’m thinking or trying to say is this reality isn’t real at all. I don’t know why I was so heavily targeted. I cannot remember ???? and get confused because I’ve been to college a lot. I’ve graduated before in the multi-verse. What I’m trying to say is my memory is very, very, very unreliable. I cannot remember most of it anymore and cannot remember what happened. I don’t think or know what universe I am in. I don’t think I posted anything about titor in this life back then or anything controversial except simulation theory or matrix t
heory, hence this is one reality of many and might not be base or the original or even real. If I created Bitcoin, which I doubt, the timelines make sense. Around the time I got sick, an email was discovered. Maybe it was my ip address, but I don’t know. I would have been outside the matrix or a clone would have used me using some inter-dimensional time travel in a very, very distant past life or another reality even. Not sure what the point was or what kind of personality or person I was. Obviously, I didn’t do it in this reality or this life or anything. It’s literally impossible. I didn’t do ????. I know the script. I got sick around july - august 2011; I woke up in 2013; I got paranoid in 2015 really, really bad; saw some ufos in 2016; and started healing and getting better on vraylar and stuff in 2017. Life has been good so far. I think I had some attempts on my life like at the hospital in 2015; the coffee shop; college; etc. The worst was the hospital because I was trapped like vermin and could
n’t escape. It was literally worse than ??????? hell. My current theory is the bitcoin theory. But I don’t know. I hope I’m just a normal dude. It’s possible I was framed by a doppelganger lol. anyways, I don’t know how to use bitcoin, would lose the wallet and passwords easily, and have no access to the money. I bet the real _USER_ID_ nakamoto is someone else. I really don’t know. I don’t know why I have these thoughts other than paranoid schizophrenia.

175920488,"It partially blocks dopamine, therefore it’s pretty weak as fas as Antipsychotics go."
175920489,"Yes. After several years, I was able to admit to myself the reason for my nervous breakdown. Several years ago, before the animal rights people apparently convinced them to not do it, Wal-_NAME_ had lobster tanks in their seafood departments, and they required their seafood department employees to steam the lobsters alive for customers. It was in 2007, near the height of what people now admit was a ‘great recession.’ I was struggling to find decent employment, and I accepted a job working in the Wal-_NAME_ meat and seafood department. It violated my conscience in a big way. I’ve never eaten lobster, as far as I know, because of the way that they have to be killed. I don’t want to be steamed alive or boiled alive. I wouldn’t choose that way of dying. I tried to rationalize my decision to work there for about 3 or 4 reasons: I didn’t want to be a financial burden to my parents. I thought that it was a necessary compromise with evil. I tried to do good from the inside, frequently steering 
people to buy the pre-cut lobster tails instead of the live lobster. I reasoned that if I didn’t do it, someone else would. My conscience would not accept these rationalizations. I think that I remember the first time that I snapped and started delusionally talking to myself as if there was an alien parasite in my head that was training me and humbling me through this process of doing something that violated my conscience. That started my psychotic episode. I think that it did teach me something, though: I should not try to rationalize away my conscience on serious things like that. There is no telling what kind of hell on earth a person will go through if they become psychotic. So, in the words of the old song now, I think in terms of big violations of my conscience: “You could stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won’t back down.” google.com i won't back down song - Google Search"

In the absence of new genetic information, and the lackluster results of lumateperone and min-101, they have hit a brick wall on new drug treatment and are instead focusing on long term studies of current drugs. I fully agree with this decision. Biologists can continue to look for genetic markers of schizophrenia, and when they find new ones, new drugs will be developed to try and address those targets. Until then, funding SHOULD go towards long term safety studies."

That’s a far cry from my experience of 1987, when I had few external difficulties but could barely tolerate living through the day – despite medication. Who is this miracle worker you ask? I’m sorry, I can’t tell you, much as I’d like to. When I wrote my first web page about my illness, I had her read it and then asked her if she’d like me to give her name. She said she would rather her name be kept private. I would rather give her the credit she deserves, but I respect her feelings so I won’t give her name. One of the main objectives of therapy is for one to develop insight into one’s condition. I would like to discuss the many insights I found but I feel I could not discuss them adequately in the space I have here. I would like to discuss just one of them, as the key point I learned also applies to many other engineers and scientists. 
If you feel that you would like to know more than I can say in what follows, then I encourage you to read _NAME_’s book Neurotic Styles, especially the chapter on Obsessive Compulsive Style. One day after I had been seeing my therapist for about seven years, she said to me, “I think it’s time” and handed me a photocopy of the Obsessive Compulsive Style chapter of _PERSON_’s book. I took it home to read and found it nothing short of astounding. As I read it I often burst out in hysterical laughter as I came across something that seemed deeply familiar from my own experience. I still find it very embarrassing to find a lifetime of experience so neatly summarized in a single chapter of a book that was published when I was one year old. I just had to read the whole book so I bought my own copy and have since read it several times.

Instead of my plans, He would eventually take me out of the rat race, that I couldn’t handle anyway, altogether. He would find me a truly great pdoc who got me on effective meds that worked, finally.

To date, only four studies have examined glutamatergic neurometabolite levels using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in patients with TRS, collectively suggesting that glutamatergic dysfunction may be implicated in the pathophysiology of TRS. Notably, the TRS patient population in these studies had mild-to-moderate illness severity, which is not entirely reflective of what i
s observed in clinical practice. In this present work, we compared glutamate?+?glutamine (Glx) levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and caudate among patients with TRS, patients with non-TRS, and healthy controls (HCs), using 3T 1H-MRS (PRESS, TE?=?35?ms). TRS criteria were defined by severe positive symptoms (i.e., ?5 on 2 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-positive symptom items or ?4 on 3 PANSS-positive symptom items), despite standard antipsychotic treatment. A total of 95 participants were included (29 TRS patients [PANSS?=?111.2?±?20.4], 33 non-TRS patients [PANSS?=?49.8?±?13.7], and 33 HCs). dACC Glx levels were higher in the TRS group vs. HCs (group effect: F[2,75]?=?4.74, p?=?0.011; TRS vs. HCs: p?=?0.012). No group differences were identified in the caudate. There were no associations between Glx levels and clinical severity in either patient group. Our results are suggestive of greater heterogeneity in TRS relative to non-TRS with respect to dACC Glx levels, necessitati
ng further research to determine biological subtypes of TRS."

175920634,"I don't think religion will die, just change. The process of creating an internal belief, validated by others, to give us meaning is what religion is, and it's morphing into something new. Look at anyone's Facebook profile and they'll look like a model, skiing in the Alps, meeting with friends, living in luxury and having a fun packed life, when in reality they're sat in their underwear, eating cereal and watching Netflix. We create a world inside our head that we're desperate for others to recognise and we get validation for this lie. We all know it happens, but we ignore it because we don't want our own lie to be undone. Instagram, Twitter, Tik-tok etc, they're all just platforms for us to create this mask-image; this false belief in others to support our own search for meaning. People believe that crystals have power; that the stars can tell your fortune, or that tapping on a wooden table will thwart bad luck. It's pure nonsense. So, why? I was discussing this with a colleague of mine some time 
ago and he said, ""I don't believe in god, but I fear him."" We're so conditioned into our beliefs and systems for implying meaning where none exists, that even when we know beyond reasonable doubt that the notion of god, for example, doesn't exist, we're still conditioned to a point where we can't challenge it without a fear of retribution. How many people could stand up and openly challenge god? Even a devout atheist would have a momentary feeling of trepidation. Not because they believe that god will punish them, but it creates a challenge to their entire system of conditioned learning. They know that they believe nonsense, but can't get passed themselves.

175920657,"What would an antidepressant do for you? It maybe your environments are too different. As in you’re in really high stress when at work and then really low stress at home and like you say. Your body doesn’t adjust quickly enough between the two. The result is that you when you do sleep, if you do much at all. It’s not good quality and then so it’s a build of improportionate stress on you. I’d say; you need something to stick to for awhile. If propranolol is posing danger, fair enough. But if you kept at it, your body could create coping mechanism biologically when it gets used to biologically knowing that it will experience the drop in pressure (as it does work directly on the heart). If this doesn’t make sense, my apologies. Maybe try therapy? or be more relaxed with whoever you are living with (in the sense that, you all are less stressed out) so you can have better quality sleep which will make sure your body can take the anxiety even if it does arise. The trick I think is a routine r
eleaxation so where or a routine destressor of some sort. Another medication maybe worth a shot; one that works without posing danger/discomfort unlike the propranolol did? Good luck, anxiety is just so so horrible. For now, I’m working on reducing smoking and controlling my stressors in the environments I put myself in. (BTW self administered CBT for your workplace environment maybe worth trying!! You try to change how you behave, think and respond to whatever “usually” happens at work — building a response of resilience that minimises how stressed out you get from it?) Again, best of luck!!"

They said I shouldn’t have been able to hear them.this went on for months.they made up several other ways of putting me under pressure to join the _NAME_.

174333451,"Hi All, Sometime back I shared my experience with you but I think at that time I wasn't able to put my thoughts in a way that would make sense to another person. Therefore, I thought of sharing my story again with by re-writing it thinking that this story might help someone one day. And this is after doing so much of research into human experiences. To read the story you could visit the below site too: The Deceptive Nature Of Synchronicities Has A Story To Tell Us About Our World, Schizophrenia And Our Delusions! – The Ultimate Disclosure Of the Man-Made Phenomena! That said, have you ever thought that synchronicities could be the cause behind certain delusions in the world? Synchronicities are meaningful events/coincidences. Well, this is my story and I could relate my experience with so many people around the world. It's just like I had a virtual reality scenario of schizophrenia. There are millions and millions of people around the world out of the blue start claiming that they get messages fr
om TV/Radio, scripts in TV shows are written for them, people around the world know them, there are microphones and other listening devices at home that is fixed by people who harass but its location cannot be identified, there are hidden message in newspapers, people use camera's in public location to monitor, friends are talking about them by sharing posts on Facebook and they make statuses just by targeting them in a negative way, they get emails from companies around the world and these corporates are harassing, etc. Although the medical community has a strong belief that such beliefs would arise in human minds due to mental illness, what you are about to hear is a totally different story. I had all these beliefs and I was paranoid too at times because of the way certain abnormal things got manifested. Therefore, I also had the firsthand experience of a person who has been labeled as mentally ill, however, in my case, without seeking medical help I came out of these delusional beliefs. Technically accordi
ng to the medical community, this should not happen. Since I managed to correct my erroneous conclusions without seeking medicine, this concludes that the medical community's conclusions are false. By saying so, I'm not referring to each and every delusion that human beings are having. The context of this article is specifically addressing the above delusions only. The delusions that human beings are having are complicated to address without using a context since even if I say that ""I wrote this article"", that itself could be a delusion if the concept ""I"" is an illusion created by the mind. That being said, my experience made me carry out massive research into human experiences. Although I found out that these beliefs are common, so far I have not found a single person who had managed to correct his/her views by critically analyzing his or her experiences in the way I have analyzed. Therefore, this will be a unique case for the medical community and I request you to take this seriously. I cannot use words 
to express the emotional impact that this can have on a person. This could easily tear down a person's personality completely. If I never managed to a keep a strong will and if I happened to seek medical help, it would have made my situation worse, therefore, I don't like this happening to another individual in this world. I must say that today after getting to know what has happened to fellow human beings who have gone through similar experiences, it's almost like I had a miraculous escape from a danger that would have affected my entire life. Considering my case, I can say that the observed phenomena which made me end up in having these erroneous conclusions (delusions that I specifically mentioned) clearly showed intelligence, was intelligent enough to trick me due to my continues observation of the phenomena. I observed very distinct changes of how this phenomena (meaningful events or the synchronicities) got manifested overtime thus it affected my conclusions and made me end up in having different delusi
ons along the way. These delusions are actually erroneous conclusions only. So your erroneous conclusion could be that your thoughts are being broadcast (thought broadcast delusion), people are following you (or gang stalking), they sneeze/cough at you, they made that gesture for you, your house has been bugged or there are microphones in your house, they talk about you all the time, you get messages through the TV and Radio, you are a famous person but you still see controversies to that claim(you think that cannot be), _NAME_ show delusion, etc. These erroneous conclusions are due to your continues observations of synchronicities (meaningful events) only. None of these are mental illnesses. I'll try to put this into perspective by giving more details of my experience. I had so many bizarre experiences. Imagine this experience by putting yourself into this scenario as it might help you understand this a bit more clearly. By doing so, here you would understand that depend on the way these synchronicities(mean
ingful events) get manifested to an observer, an observer would make different erroneous conclusions depend on their knowledge, depending on their beliefs, depend on their critical thinking ability, etc.. therefore, the delusions that would arise in an observer's mind would be different in each scenario. After detailing my experience and showing important points, I could show what has happened to certain individuals around the world too. I was living in a foreign country when this was happening. And in my case, the very first synchronicities started with the friends who lived with me in the same apartment and I had a normal life with them. However, suddenly, the Facebook statuses of these friends, things they shared on their Facebook walls, started correlating with my personal life events. Not only that I also observed very distinct but sudden behavioral changes(how they interacted with me and their own activities) in them and this supported my (false)conclusions. I observed this for a couple of months contin
uously, therefore, I had to conclude that they are talking about me and they are not in good terms with me any longer. So my initial assumption that these are mere coincidences only is no longer exist in my mind anymore. (Today I understand that these are a high number of synchronicities only. Sudden behavioral changes could have been due to certain things that happened to them, however, strangely that again correlated with my life events.) Finally, these synchronicities made me argue with these friends(mainly one person). At this stage, I again started observing strange synchronicities with few more friends who are known to these friends but they were not staying with us in the same apartment. Again due to the abnormally high number of synchronicities, I had to conclude now that all these friends are talking about me. However, they always rejected my accusations, yet the synchronicities that I observed tricked me, again and again, to conclude the same thus created a false belief in me. Over a period of I wou
ld say 7, 8 months, I observed these strange synchronicities with so many friends who lived in the same city and then I started observing synchronicities with some friends that I met through an Institute a long time ago but they were living in different cities. Again due to the high number of strange synchronicities, I had to conclude that these friends who stayed with me have spoken to these friends who I got to know from this institute in someway. I thought perhaps through a mutual friend that I had. After a years time from meeting these friends for the first time, I relocated myself to another city but I continuously observed these synchronicities taking place on Facebook. However, finally, I thought that it would be better avoid having any type of conversations with these friends due to the negativity and I decided to remove friends who stayed with me in the same apartment and few other friends that I thought who involved. A few days after I remove them, I again started observing strange synchronicities w
ith a former colleague but he was staying in a different country. Thereafter, it didn't take time for me to observe synchronicities with few more colleagues. These are again Facebook statuses and the things they shared on their Facebook walls. Here I thought that due to my recent action, these friends are now taking further actions to put me down and now they are contacting more people and getting their support to say negative things to me. These sudden changes were so apparent to me and went beyond to a level that I could consider as a coincidence so I believed that they are intentionally doing this work. I called one of my colleagues and told my story but my colleague knew nothing about it and the synchronicities continued. Then I came back to my country, however, during this period, the emails that I got from Guardian, Microsoft, etc.. also started showing synchronicities, the email headings always correlated with my life events. This made me think that these friends knew some high profile people who work 
for these companies, and they are getting help from them too to disturb my life. Because of certain activities, I believed people at Forbes, Bloomberg, Facebook, knew me. Again, these are all due to experiences in a synchronistic manner. Therefore, this is not that I woke up one day and thought that people who work for these companies know me. I concluded this since these synchronicities took place to such an extent, therefore, I couldn't consider any of these as mere coincidences only. These strange activities didn't end there, then I observed these synchronicities with so many school friends and finally with my childhood friends too. Over time, this created extreme distress in me. I also observed that when I contact certain friends and share my story with them, the very next day they would also make statuses that would show correlations to my life events. This made me check their Facebook profiles even to see when they have had posted anything on their walls or updated their statuses for the last time, many 
occasions, I could not see any activities on their walls too for such a long time, thus gave me more evidence that their being influenced in some way. Therefore, I believed that they somehow get to know my life events but they don't like to acknowledge it. And this made me believe that they are lying at the same time (looking back these were again synchronicities only). So the synchronicities are what was isolating me from the society by creating trust issues/misunderstandings. From my point of view, all my friends are acting as psychopaths now but for them, it's more like I'm having a mental illness. I was perplexed. This went to an extreme level so I started questioning the meaning of reality too. I was desperately looking for answers. This shouldn't happen, it's like these friends who stayed with me is able to brainwash my close friends. Do they pay my friends? Even if that happens, will my friends agree and participate in this? What happened to their values? Therefore, what methods they employ to get ever
yone's support didn't make sense at all since what I observed is not normal human behavior. The assumptions that I made to understand the phenomena goes against logic, many controversies were there but still, the phenomena tricked me again and again thus created a false belief in me. I stopped talking to so many friends as I could not trust anyone anymore. Up to this day, I only observed synchronicities through Facebook and my conversations with them (calling applications/messaging applications(chat)). So I thought that these friends who stayed with me are communicating with my friends, colleagues perhaps by sending messages through Facebook, emails or phone calls. However, I didn't understand exactly how this communication is taking place. I was just speculating and was trying to come up with a theory that explains the phenomena or my observations. I even thought perhaps they have created a group now, so it would be easy for them to communicate with each other easily and also mention what to post on their Fa
cebook walls by targeting me. I also thought (assume) perhaps it's because of this group only, some of my friends participate in this harassment but they still don't like to reveal anything about the existence of this group to me. Even at this stage, I still did not observe anyone referring to my thoughts, my activities at home and neither I did observe synchronicities through radio or TV, related to my life events. However, one day I saw a friend making a status directly relating to a conversation that I had at home. This didn't make sense to me at first so I ignored it but then again these new type of synchronicities continued on a daily basis. This made me believe that they have hacked my computer too to listen to my private conversations now. I have been in the technology sector for over a decade when this was happening, therefore, I have an understanding of the way how computers could be hacked. So, I took certain precautions to avoid being hacked and all the possibilities to identify me even on the Inte
rnet too. After taking all the precautions, this is by considering bios-rootkit attacks too (even if you format a machine, a hacker can still access the machine with such tools), the very next day when I randomly log into the Facebook the very first status that I would see is something similar to ""haha, he's trying to become smarter than us!! And then someone would comment, ""that's funny. lol"" and then I would see various similar comments from other friends too. My efforts are in vain, now they are boasting their capabilities through Facebook statuses. I'm so flabbergasted now, how could they possibly hack my laptop? This shouldn't happen. Then by looking at the comments, because of the way this synchronicity got manifested, I'm beginning to think that ""all these people are actually involved in this and they all are talking about me, they know me. If not how come such a status is there in the first place?"" These were my thoughts. Then no matter what precautions I take the synchronicities continued. (Toda
y I totally understand what kind of comments people would make for such a status, however seeing such a status just after my activity is what fooled me. Looking back these were again synchronicities only. Of course, when this was happening I didn't know if these were synchronicities only or their thoughts have been influenced in any way). I could not find the source and by analyzing everything, I had to conclude that without getting help from ISP's, software vendors, this is an impossible task. This made me believe that even ISP's are involved in this. Over time, this made me think if they have fixed microphones even in my house and I also researched online to find out whether they are microphones that could capture sounds from distant locations. Then I started suspecting my neighbors too. I felt uncomfortable talking at him, thinking people are listening to me, some of my neighbors are also (possibly) listening to me (another assumption). During this time Hotmail delivered their email service without the htt
ps facility but Gmail offered the https service for a quite some time now. I didn't like anyone know my emails, so I checked if I could activate the https facility on my Hotmail email account too, however, this option wasn't there. It took only a few days for Hotmail to introduce the https facility for their email service after this day. Now I'm thinking whether these friends helped me with this? But if so why? To show me that they still can hack and know the contents of my emails too? From my perspective, this was a quick deployment, so I thought "" wow, they should know some top people at Microsoft to do this and implement this feature so quickly"". I have been using Hotmail for over 5,6 years but this was the first time Hotmail introduced the https feature and I thought it's because of me (further synchronicities). This should help you understand my life situation, what kind of delusions that I had. I made various assumptions and tested to make sense of this information leak but I still couldn't identify t
he source. Now I had to cover the camera by thinking they can see me too through the camera (due to certain synchronicities). When my family members ask the reason behind it, most of the time I avoided giving a direct answer. So they also observed certain behavioral changes in me and I'm not comfortable enough to address this directly with them, cause this whole thing would look crazy to another person. I also observed certain synchronicities related to the conversations that I had when I was out, when I was in certain locations, therefore, this made me think that my phone has also been hacked but I tried going out without taking my mobile phone still the synchronicities continued, then I also started suspecting camera's in these locations. Therefore, due to certain synchronicities, my thinking was ""wow they were actively looking at me when I was there or recording that was captured by the camera has been shared with my friends"". If not how would they know? How this is remotely possible? Well, again those w
ere my thoughts. I also suspected if mobile phones of my friends also got hacked. And then on another occasion, I wanted to understand how they communicate with each other (this massive group) and I was thinking whether I could use a social engineering method to hack into a pc so I could monitor the activities remotely. Having this in mind, I understood that the easiest method would be to plant a tool on a friends computer. There was this friend of mine who I thought involved in this and in the past, I have used his pc many times when I visited him. This friend also kept denying his involvement ever since. So after I preparing my tool I went to his house to plant this in his computer, strangely that day his computer wasn't working at all. And then again later that day when I logged into Facebook, I would see a status similar to ""Hahaha, that was funny. He failed again. lol"" and then others have been making relevant comments. This was the first comment that I saw when I logged into Facebook. This made me thi
nk that they all are now talking about my action this is including the people who participated from Facebook, Microsoft, Guardian and so many friends around the world. That day I felt so bad about it and I also felt so guilty about my work too. This is not something I would do but I had to work on this extreme act just because of my situation. It took a couple of days for me to forget this incident since in my world this thing really happened, it's an actual experience that I had and so many people around the world knows. During this time a few more strange things happened to me: i). I started having a tingling sensation on my body. ii). I started feeling a session where bugs crawling on my skin at times. iii). I had certain smells but I couldn't identify the source and technically it shouldn't be there in my room. iv). One day after I listen to a song, a clip of this song kept on playing in my head (my internal voice/internal monologue). This clip played again and again in my head and I couldn't forget no ma
tter what I do. Although the above three experiences didn't continue much, this strange thing happened to me quite often just to disturb my day. v). Then this strange event, I woke up one day but as soon as I woke up, I kept thinking of something that I thought of yesterday. For a couple of days, this happened and I started wondering how on Earth I wake up and have the same exact thought in my mind? This shouldn't happen. I clearly observed that it's like my thoughts are being replayed, the exact same thought but then this stopped completely after this day. vi). No matter what time I wake up, I noticed that the same song goes on the radio. The radio is in the kitchen and I usually could hear it from my room. My grandfather always likes to listen to it whilst working. I noticed this after a few days only and I thought how that's even possible. Just after I had this thought, this phenomenon again got changed and now as soon as I get to the kitchen this same song started going on the radio and it continued for a
nother couple of days. This made me think that even people in some of the radio stations know me, they also monitor me or they get real-time updates about my activities. And I thought there must be microphones in my kitchen too yet I couldn't identify it's the location. Now I started contemplating on talking to the friends who stayed with me in the same apartment, during this period, Hotmail also changed their signing page also with a picture (this page didn't have any images earlier, just a plain login page) then I started seeing synchronicities with this newly designed signing page too. I faced many but let me mention one thing, one day, this page changed with an image showing the word ""Script"", I wondered why they used this word and I knew they are again giving me a clue to some activity (attached the image), within 2, 3 days after this day, I started seeing synchronicities through TV. I have been watching this particular drama going in the night for some time and I have never noticed any conversations r
eferring to my life events up to very this day but after a couple of days now the meaning of the word script in the picture became clear to me, they were referring to TV scripts. These synchronicities were related to the conversations that I had at home and also mundane things such as traveling, having a haircut, my eating habits so on and so forth. This script also showed references to the conversations that my family members had in the house, this made me extremely angry towards these friends, scriptwriters and even the actors but then thereafter synchronicities related to the conversations that my family members had stopped immediately. This observation made me think that they have now decided that it's not good to mention these conversations that my family members have, so they stopped it. Looking back, I can say that this particular synchronicity stopped based on my thoughts only since I did not verbally say anything related to this incident. I only knew that they stopped since the synchronicities stoppe
d suddenly. I can still recall this particular memory because of the intense anger that I had. If I had met any of these friends/actors, scriptwriters during this time, I would have had a fight. If so this would have convinced anyone that I'm having a mental illness, however, looking back, these are all due to an extremely high number of synchronicities that I faced on a daily basis through various mediums. This created more and more distress in me but then again I wanted to fight back for these unethical acts. There were days that I was pondering in my mind from morning to evening on how I could find a resolution for this. I was thinking why my reality has changed in such a strange way, that I even cannot understand at times due to controversies. So I was still desperately looking for answers, no one can help me, cause no one can understand my claims, my experiences. I also understood that I cannot tackle this situation by having such an angry mind state, it affects my decisions, therefore, I started paying 
close attention to my emotions more than ever. But then again this is beyond belief, how they managed to get in touch with scriptwriters/actors? Well, they have contacts at Microsoft, Bloomberg, Youtube, Forbes, etc.. so why not? This was my thought or the assumption that I made to understand this particularly strange experience. Because of the way these events get manifested, from my perspective it became apparent that my friends are trying to put me mentally down, however, I'm still fighting for these unethical acts, so I was still like ""bring it on!, I'm still moving forward with my life goals no matter what you guys do"", those were my thoughts. At the same time, I observed synchronicities through radio stations too. In some cases, my grandfather would switch on the radio at random times and select the right channel so I would listen to the radio presenter giving references to my life events. Not only that, whilst I'm working on something, I would randomly have thoughts of listening to the radio, and I t
urn on the radio, select the right channel just to hear them talking about me(synchronicities - think about situations where people giving hints). These are very clear observations that I made. I did not see synchronicities just because I listen to the radio or watch the TV, certain particular times only. How I'm I getting to know such a program is going in the air and randomly have thoughts to switch on the radio or the TV? Why I had thoughts of selecting this particular channel? I'm confused and I did not find any logical explanation even at this stage. Thereafter, less than two or three weeks, I started seeing synchronicities related to my thoughts in these TV scripts. This was the first time that I noticed this perhaps due to the high number of synchronicities directly relating to my thoughts and I clearly observed the same through Facebook too after this day. This created further distress in me since now I cannot even think without all these people getting to know my thoughts and they are from all over t
he world. These were my thoughts. I immediately started suspecting NSA's involvement since they should have the highest surveillance capability in the world, so now I'm thinking even people who work for the NSA support all my friends just to put me mentally down. This is not all, now sometimes, I saw certain responses almost in real-time with live TV and radio presenters. Are they listening to my thoughts in real-time? If so, NSA is now sharing certain platform capabilities with my friends? Since I'm in the technology sector, I wanted to understand the technical side of it but I didn't find a proper logic to explain my observation but I know it's happening to me. I did not observe these real-time responses with dramas but when live programs it became apparent to me. Actors in drama also imitated my body postures, gestures even. I can also mention an experience that shows some connection to this. There were situations where people would spontaneously take topics that were in my mind at that very moment and dis
cuss it or make a statement that would correlate with my thoughts. I faced this so many times, beyond to a level that we could consider as a coincidence but nothing made sense to me in the beginning. (Now if you imagine this strange phenomenon happens to you with TV and the Radio presenters. So this is what happened to me.) When I started observing this new phenomenon relating my thoughts and thinking that NSA is decoding my thoughts using some satellite-based technology, I had the interest to know it's capabilities. Can they really decode my thoughts accurately to that extent? So I thought of a unique number to see if they could decode that too, to surprise me a friend of mine again made a status, stating the same number which proved me they can. And then on a few more occasions, I tested this, I still observed the same which convinced me that they can and I thought perhaps they mention what to write in the group so a friend of mine makes a status related to my thought. This is the group that I assumed to ex
ist just to make sense of how these communications are taking place. Therefore, my careful observations proved to me that my thoughts are being accurately decoded and they show it too. Then I also tested if they could see what my eyes are seeing, again I had to make the same conclusion because of the synchronicities, they can. How about my intentions? I thought perhaps they still cannot know my intentions, however, here I clearly noticed, that they can know my intentions too(synchronicities started manifesting according to my intentions). This made me believe that I cannot fool this system in any way due to my various observations of how these synchronicities got manifested. I had to conclude that any perception that I could consciously have/aware of, this technology is able to decode it. Even though if I do certain things without having an internal monologue(my internal voice related to thoughts), they still can know. My various tests and the various observations made me conclude this. These are again synchr
onicities. This should help someone understand that I carried out certain testings even with regard to my assumptions prior to making a conclusion. If I observed that my assumptions are becoming true or find convincing evidence with regard to the assumption, I concluded that the assumption is true. Especially when I observed that people were referring to my thoughts, I did a careful analysis just to make sure that this is really happening and later I got fascinated by the technology itself. This made me research into mind reading technologies but then again further bizarre things started manifesting. One day I was contemplating researching into mind reading technologies and then later that day when I actually started doing my research online, within minutes I faced a power cut. I got a bit scared, I was perplexed at the same time. How come that took place, is that a coincidence or are they trying to stop me? And then I observed this strange phenomenon many times regardless of the time that I start doing this 
research. Since I was thinking that NSA holds this technology, I'm beginning to think that they don't like me doing this research. How come they control me to this level? And how are they doing these power cuts? I thought they have contacts in these organizations too and now my friends are getting support from the utility companies too. If not how come? This shouldn't happen. However, then I called their call center to know what was the reason behind the power cut just to see what's going on with them, but then they told me that there was damage to one of the transformers in my area and they are fixing it. And now I'm confused, I thought they have contacts but now I got to know that a transformer was damaged. Are they lying to me? If it's really damaged what was the cause behind it? Still, this didn't make sense to me and I still thought that my friends have some contacts here too or managed to find a contact cause in my mind I already believed that so many companies are involved in this harassment. This is n
ot all, then one day when I was planning to research into mind reading technologies in an evening, this time it started raining heavily with thundering and I could not use the computer. Someone would remotely believe this claim of mine, however, let me say, from this day onwards, this strange phenomenon also started manifesting many times along with sudden disruption to my Internet. Regardless of the time, either it started raining on times or if I use the Internet, I would face issues with my Internet. I still didn't like to give up, my thoughts were like ""if you can decode my thoughts, I'm going to research and find out how you are able to do it and expose it"". I thought my friends are involved in all these. And now I'm thinking perhaps they all don't like to get caught and after all, this is not a technology that is known by the people around the world, so how can they let this exposed by using it to affect my life just because of their high profile contacts? So I'm thinking that they are doing their bes
t to avoid this happening. Whilst I'm facing these abnormal events, I also started seeing synchronicities related to my life events from a couple of other dramas too and these synchronicities took place to an extent where I could not go in front of the TV during 7.30 to 9 since my family members watch these dramas/shows during this time. I felt intense anger towards my friends, actors, scriptwriters, etc... So I always avoided this time and then started watching the TV a bit later in the night if I wanted to. During this time new advertisements also started popping up on the TV, strangely these advertisements also showed a correlation to my life events. In other words, these are also synchronicities. This made me believe that even people who work for these companies are involved. Not only that, there was this channel that was showing a Friday night movie for some time. Now when they are showing the clip related to the upcoming movie, they knew exactly how to trim the clip so the conversation will relate to my 
life. Are they watching the entire movie and finding the exact spot to trim to say something negative to me? I had no explanation about this. I thought they are using software to quickly identify these spots in movies, so they could easily trim it in such a fine way. If not why would they spend this much time to do these silly things? This is not even worth. Again all these assumptions that I made to understand my observations are still controversial but I was trying to find the best possible explanation for my observation. Therefore, no matter what my beliefs are, I was still looking for a theory or a logical explanation to understand my observations. I always used logic to understand life, my interaction with the world but my reality is so different now, it doesn't make sense anymore but I'm holding onto these beliefs due to these meaningful interactions or synchronicities. Further, my family members and I also got strange phone calls during this period, sometimes no one was on the other side but then at ti
mes, people have dialed our numbers mistakenly. At the time of occurring, I didn't think that those were mistakes, I thought those were deliberate actions, just because of my work. I thought they are taking more help to pressure me since I continued to research. My recovery: Finally, after facing all these strange events, I made a decision to directly address the issues. I thought I should contact the friends who stayed with me in the same apartment as soon as possible and talk to them about my experiences. These friends are living in a different country now and I was trying to find contact numbers. Whilst I'm trying this, I also thought of meeting friends who are living in my country. I'm making plans now to meet some local friends but now the theme behind the synchronicities got suddenly changed, people shared more posts related to accidents and deaths. Then a few days before I was about to meet this particular friend, now I was attacked (because of the way these events manifested I had to call this as an a
ttack) by a high-frequency tone. It was extremely loud, I could hardly bear its effects. The intensity of this sound made me feel like electricity running from my brain to the body but only I could hear it. The sound was mechanical and this is the exact same sound that the American diplomats heard but it was extremely high in my case, let me copy the link: Listen to the sound US embassy workers heard in the Cuba attacks I did not know what to do, I could not tell this to anyone since this would not make sense to anyone. I couldn't report to the police either even though I had such thoughts and I had to bear it for an almost a day but then the sound went down to a level that I could bear but still this bothered my day now. How come friends would involve with such an extreme act? I'm clueless but still, I believed they are doing it because of my life events. It was like they are threatening me now and it's more serious than I could possibly think of. But I still decided I should meet friends to discuss this, th
en I actually managed to meet a friend. This time, this friend that I met seriously tried to help me by listening to my story. We had a long conversation that day and I carefully observed his conversation with me because of the trust issues that I had, how he reacted to me etc.. but this convinced me that he should not know anything happening in my life although I believed otherwise. I was surprised how he didn't know yet his actions convinced me, so I started trusting this friend. And I knew this friend meet this particular friend that I thought who involve in this harassment. So now through the friend that I manage to trust, I wanted to know what my other friend(another friend that I suspected) would say about his involvement. I did not want to directly ask from this suspected friend since I thought he would still find a reason to hide the truth and avoid telling me the truth. Later that day this friend who I met( the friend that I trust) confirmed to me that not even the friend that I suspected are involve
d in this. Again now I'm perplexed. How come that be? Then three of us made a decision to meet. We met and discussed this for perhaps 5, 6+ hours and that convinced me that these two friends are not definitely involved. Since I have trust in them, through them I checked if others know anything and I got the same results, my friends are not involved. Basically, I created a chain of trust(clarify the involvement through parties that I trust) and this made me understand that the friends that I thought who involved are actually not involved. They were having their normal lives. However, now this is even more complicated to understand. I have no doubt about my observations, cause I tested my assumptions even again and again. I started having deep thoughts, how I ended up in having such conclusions? What really happened to me? Why do I see a totally different world view now when I analyze this phenomena from trusted channels or trusted parties? Did someone fool me for such a long time on a daily basis? What could b
e the purpose and if so how? These events were real, I wasn't dreaming. To address these controversies I decided to check Facebook walls too. So I started checking Facebook profiles/ their walls, just to make sure that these statuses made by my friends, the things they shared on their walls in the past are still there and I could still find it. If so did someone hacks their profiles or did they actually made these statuses? But even if this is hacking, how can I find a logical reason for all my other observations? What about dreams? What about TV/Radio presenters? What about scriptwriters or these dramas. Emails that I got? News articles? Power cuts, the conversations that I had over calls, etc. Hacking itself cannot explain all the controversies. Having said that I still thought of talking to my friends and wanted to know if they have actually made those statuses in the past and if so what made them do so since this should give clues to understand this mystery. And I called them, there I found out that they 
have actually made those statuses and shared certain posts. Certain occasions, I found out that they had random thoughts to make a status or share a post on their walls. And on certain occasions, they had specific reasons to do so. So it wasn't hacking at all, they actually had thoughts in their minds related to these actions. This mystery became so deep then I thought, so no wonder I got caught to it. How come they had these unique thoughts is another mystery that I should address now. To make a status or to share a post, they should have thoughts in their minds and they should make a conscious decision. Even at this point, I cannot take any of these as mere coincidences only, cause, this is beyond what I could consider as a coincidence since this kept on happening for such a long time and I carefully observed it. I tested my assumptions too and observed the reactions prior to making a conclusion. This is why I had to question the meaning of reality too and I was looking for logical answers to this mystery s
ince at times I clearly saw controversies. Therefore, by analyzing all, I had to conclude that their thoughts are being affected in some strange way although they never knew. By affecting their thoughts, their actions have been affected. And that correlated with my life events. However, this is completely invisible to everyone. I also realized that on certain occasions my thoughts also have been affected. For example, there were times I switched on the radio just to hear them talking about me (the synchronicities). When this happened to me beyond a level that I could consider as a coincidence, I started wondering how on Earth I had thoughts related to switching on the TV or radio at these particular times. Therefore, now I had to conclude that even my thoughts had been influenced at times. This unidentified influence on human brains/minds is the cause behind the meaningful events or the synchronicities that I have been observing on a daily basis. My observations and the assumptions that I made to understand t
hese meaningful events (synchronicities) made me end up in having false conclusions. This was the reason behind my delusions. Therefore, finally I started making sense of my reality and now I understand why my friends always rejected my accusations, why they got surprised all the time. Although I understood now that my friends are not actually involved in anything, I still needed a logical explanation to understand this whole thing. So I started analyzing what really happened to me in the past. Even at this point, I still had the belief that NSA is behind decoding my thoughts. Then I understood, I had certain abnormal thoughts in my mind which didn't make sense to me. Let me list down some: There were days that songs kept playing in my head. This was a thought (my internal monologue). There were days that I woke up by having the same thought in my mind or one particular thought got replayed in my mind every morning when I woke up. I was looking for an explanation. I had thoughts of switching on the TV or radi
o just to listen to these conversations and they referred to my thoughts and life events. How did I know? How come I had these thoughts? My grandfather switched on the radio many times and selected the right radio channel at the right time, and that made me listen to these programs that showed correlations to my life events in their conversations. All these were extremely puzzling for me at the time of occurring. Didn't make sense how these events were manifesting but by doing this analysis I understood that my thoughts and my grandfather's thoughts have been affected too. Although I thought those were my thoughts, it was clear that my thought has been affected. Even at this stage, I'm thinking NSA is decoding my thoughts, so now I started thinking whether they are capable of inducing thoughts to people too by stimulating brains? If so what about the thoughts of my friends? What about people in radio and TV stations? I had to make the same conclusion since their thoughts are also have been affected in a myste
rious way thus created all the synchronicities. Not only that I had to make the very same conclusion for the scriptwriters, but their thoughts also have been affected so the content of the script will show correlations to my life events. Therefore, now I found some logical explanation to explain the observed phenomena, at least a logical theory that I could hold onto, which is that this technology is able to stimulate brains and play games with our perceptions. I had to conclude that internal monologue is also a perception. By stimulating unique areas of our brains (_PERSON_ / other thought perception areas) could make us believe that we are thinking although our mind never originates this thought. Logically thinking, I had to conclude that there are no words in our minds, the mind is using neural networks to perceive these words simply by stimulating the right neural networks. This should happen when a particular thought arises in our minds and perhaps, this could work according to resonance theories. Theref
ore, simply by stimulating the brain (the right neural networks) related to thought perception(word perception), we might be able to exploit this process and make us believe that we are thinking. I had to conclude that an AI can be developed to handle this process so the neural networks related to word perception can be stimulated in a timely manner so our minds will perceive a thought. And this can be used to fool a victim. Of course, we don't follow all the thoughts that come to our minds but still based on the personality, we still can exploit a human being. For example, inducing a thought to a person who steals, we could influence his actions, however, inducing such a thought to a person who would never steal would be useless and he/she would start questioning why they randomly get such thoughts. Which means, extremely advanced AI's can be used to exploit even scriptwriters when we manage to decode our brain. Therefore, I had to make such conclusions to understand my own experience. What about songs that 
got stuck in my head? What about dreams? What about the sensations that I had? By analyzing these experiences, I had to conclude that this technology is able to directly stimulate different parts of my brain, very precisely so my perceptions can be altered or induced. At this time, I actually started believing that the NSA must have the technology. I can say that it was not my intention to create these synchronicities, neither any of the people who I thought were involved yet synchronicities just kept on manifesting just to bring distress to my life. Clearly, these are not just random manifestations, it took turns when it cannot find a way to interact with me. When I removed certain friends, these synchronicities started manifesting through friends that were known to me and I remotely thought that this would happen, my thinking was that by removing these friends I could move forward with my life peacefully but I was wrong, the most unexpected thing happened just to surprise me and distress me even more. When 
I started contemplating on talking with friends who stayed with me to share my experience and understand why they are doing this, it again took a turn to bring me more distress. This was a clear observation that I made. No matter what medium the synchronicities started manifesting, it always manifested to bring distress at the highest level. Therefore, I held to this conclusion for a couple of months until I started researching into human experiences around the world and I found out that these experiences are going back to the 17th, 18th century even. I also studied to understand what kind of a brain-computer interface could reproduce the observed phenomena and by researching into neuroscience I finally had to conclude that NSA/CIA should not have such a technology, neither any recent inventions can be used to reproduce the observations that I made. Such technology must have the capability to precisely stimulate individual neurons of human brains. This is not easy even if implants are used since that will aff
ect a particular brain area only. Therefore, even theories related to implants cannot reproduce my observations, therefore, by researching online although I got to know that people had such views, I had to conclude that those are all false conclusions only. With Optogenetics, today we are doing a neuron level brain stimulation but still, these are very basic technologies compare to a technology that could reproduce my observations. Nevertheless, by facing such an extreme situation, I understood the importance of having the right view and I understood that ignoring important data (due to trust issues, seeing as not important, etc..), not being able to understand the available data, not having enough data, will create delusions in our minds. What are the possible causes behind these synchronicities? Due to the high number of synchronicities that I experienced over a long period of time(around 18 to 24 months), it's clear that thoughts of friends and certain people around the world have been affected. However, t
his becomes apparent when we analyze my experience only. Without doing this analysis, this influence would be invisible to everyone. That said, I never consciously tried to affect anyone's thoughts or actions to create these synchronicities, neither I found convincing evidence to claim that my friends and people who I suspected had conscious thoughts either. Therefore, such theories can be disregarded when explaining my observations. The majority of these synchronicities were related to the past events of mine, it could be a conversation that I had, my past action, a thought that I had, etc.. which means, we can also safely ignore the view that it was my friends unconsciously affected my thoughts and my actions. Since I managed to understand that it was these synchronicities behind my delusions, I cannot agree with theories such as retrocausality either, cause if that's the case, I wouldn't be able to come out of these delusions since my recovery would be beyond my control. If so, did I unconsciously influenc
e the thoughts of my friends and people around the world? 1) By looking at my case, If I still don't find a logic whether it would be remotely possible for me to unconsciously influence people who worked at Microsoft, Guarding, Forbes, Bloomberg, Facebook, etc.. Not only that then unconsciously influencing scriptwriters for over 4, 5 months is again highly controversial. Watching these shows/dramas, I can say that the people who wrote the scripts had very specific thoughts in their minds that correlated with my activities. Their thoughts have been influenced to such an extent although they had no clue that this has happened. Even if I talk to them directly about this, they would still deny my claims. Having said that, from my perspective it's clear that, they have written the scripts just like they observed my actions during this period and also my thoughts. And the actors managed to imitate my body movements too and this convinced me more than anything. This is why I couldn't go in front of the TV. This crea
ted so much anger in me. Therefore, I still cannot find a logical reason to say that I unconsciously influence human beings on Earth to this extent. 2). I observed these TV scripts just after Microsoft updating it's signing page with a particular picture showing the word ""Script"""". This made me believe that some people at Microsoft involved in this harassment. So for me to observe the synchronicities through the scripts, did people at Microsoft influenced the thoughts of the scriptwriters? Again, this cannot be, cause the synchronicities were related to my actions and thoughts. People at Microsoft shouldn't even know that I had such an experience, if so how come they can influence scriptwriters for such a long time, so the script will show correlations to my life events? 3). Did the scriptwriters unconsciously know my actions and thoughts? If so why I started seeing synchronicities with Microsoft prior I observing scripts on the TV? Directly giving a clue that this is going to happen? Why this strange sync
hronicity took place prior I observing synchronicities through TV shows? That was a timely manifestation. 4). When I started seeing synchronicities related to the conversations that my family members were having I got intense anger then suddenly those synchronicities stopped. Does that mean my conscious thoughts stopped those synchronicities? That cannot be the cause either, cause I had no control at all. It acted on its own, it made its own decisions. It's more like I was a victim only. Clearly, those synchronicities stopped just to convince me that scriptwriters get to know my life events, they know me. Therefore, by analyzing these controversial data, I have to conclude that it was never my mind consciously or unconsciously affected anyone's thoughts or actions. Neither my friends or people around the world affected my thoughts or actions. Which means, some external process must have influenced thoughts of everyone and this affected everyone's actions. And this external process clearly used so many people 
and targeted me when creating these synchronicities. This made me end up in having erroneous conclusions thus created delusions in me. I could mention another observation that I made that should support this view. Sometimes I think in English and sometimes I think in my local language too. Except for the local friends, most of the foreign friends didn't actually know my language. i). By looking at the synchronicities, I can also state that when I had thoughts in my local language, people who never knew my language still responded in English. How this synchronicity got manifested if the friend who I had the synchronicity with had no clue of my local language? How his mind would understand this information? ii). Then again I use my local language when speaking with my family members but still friends who had no clue of my language still responded in English? So the same question, how this synchronicity got manifested if the friend who I had the synchronicity with had no clue of my local language? Therefore by c
onsidering all, my mind directly affecting the minds of my friends consciously or unconsciously, minds of people who worked for these companies directly or their minds directly affecting my mind consciously or unconsciously is another controversial proposition. It's apparent that our minds are being affected, there's no controversy on that, however, when we finding the cause behind it, the only logical conclusion that we can hold onto is that it's due to an external process that we haven't identified yet. This external process clearly shows intelligence. Clearly, it has access to our thoughts, it's interacting with our brains and influencing our minds, our decisions. It also shows that it could intelligently manipulate our perceptions, which means, it should understand human perceptions well. What can I say about this external process? 1). It acted on its own. My observation of the phenomena showed that it acted like a trickster. Clearly, when it cannot find a way to reach me, it made different decisions to r
each me. 2). The phenomena clearly showed decision-making capabilities. 3). It must be able to create these synchronicities with anyone on Earth in complicated ways. 4). Regardless of our languages, it could still create these synchronicities by interacting with our brains/minds. 5). It must record our past thoughts/actions and use that data to make decisions in the future. 6). It could stimulate individual neural networks and alter our perception. I continued my research and I clearly observed that there were times that this intelligence acted instantly. For example when I do my research and whenever I got insightful thoughts, I got sudden calls from my friends/family members, etc.., I got emails, messages from applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, etc.. just to disrupt my thinking and also instantaneous disruption to power continued regardless of where I stayed. Sometimes I forgot my thoughts by reacting to these external events but later I managed to keep my concentration and continued my work. These are h
ighly abnormal synchronicities, the theme of these synchronicities has once again changed. By considering all, can we say that a natural cause behind my experiences? I don't find convincing evidence to hold onto such a view. The phenomena showed to many synchronicities, just like it had its own mind and showed me decision-making capabilities again and again. Thereafter, I still continued my research to understand this phenomena, whenever I managed to have insightful thoughts, there were so many occasions that I got sudden calls from friends, family members and even from unknown people, I instantly got emails, I still faced disruption to my Internet and power regardless of my location. And then I started sneezing whenever I had an insightful thought at that very moment. Therefore, today by considering all, I had to conclude that an unidentified mind-boggling technology is behind this. Let me mention this strange experience also separately: A few months after I facing strange synchronicities for the first time, 
one day I literally got floated above my bed at least an inch. One could find this hard to believe but I was awake when this was happening. This happened less than 15 minutes after I go to bed, around 2.30, 3 in the morning. My bed had a plastic covering so it produces this sound when pressure is applied and releases. I was sleeping sideways and suddenly my body started floating. I instantly listened to the sound coming from the mattress whilst watching this just to confirm that this is really happening and now I'm giving close attention to my entire body, I feel less and less pressure coming from the side of the body that touches the mattress, and now I clearly know that certain parts of my body are not touching the mattress at all. I floated at least an inch from the bed stayed there for a few seconds. The total vertical movement must have been more than an inch. I got afraid to move my body and I'm still observing this strange phenomenon but then gradually my body again lowered back to the bed. Again I can 
now hear the sound of the mattress since my body again started pressing the mattress and I can feel the pressure as my body gradually falling down to the same sleeping position. Even after I go back to the bed, I kept on thinking for a couple of seconds further without moving my body to make sure that this is over. Thereafter, that night I kept on thinking what on Earth happened to me, what could be the reason behind this but I did not find an explanation. When I was carrying out my research, I found another individual who has been having similar experiences. He has been having this experience for over 4 years and once he has been treated for schizophrenia too. He believed that there's a gang who is stalking him. No matter which city he travels he observed these stalkers were there. By having a call with him, I understood that he was referring to gestures, the things they said or the conversations that he heard, etc.. when he describes his experience. He also believed that his house has been bugged and he tho
ught that's how these stalkers know him. Based on my experience, I knew that this cannot be true, therefore, I had so many calls with him and explained to him how to look at the phenomena. He kept on arguing with me and claimed that I'm wrong. After 5, 6 months, he finally understood that there are no stalkers and claimed that my explanation was right. Although at that time, I told him that the NSA has the technology, today I know that this is not true either. However, this is my question to the medical community, if this person really had a mental illness or a chemical imbalance, how did I manage to get him out of his delusions? He no longer believes that the stalkers are there in any of the cities, neither he believes that these people have hacked his house. He understood the existence of phenomena but then again he understood that the other beliefs he had are not actually true. He also started having a normal life. Therefore, not only that I managed to come out of it, I managed to change the belief of anot
her person, a person who has been treated for schizophrenia. What is the implication of this? It's obvious that the observations and the conclusions made by the medical community are also false. What could be the case if I had consulted psychiatric services? What can you do if you ever had to conclude that you get messages from TV or Radio? Or if you happened to conclude that people who are living in your city know you? Or people around the world know you? Famous people know you? Generally, you will have these erroneous conclusions by observing these synchronicities for a long time only. This will not happen overnight. This experience will be so real to you because of the way these synchronicities are manifesting, therefore, you will not listen to others even if they claim that it's not true or if someone claims that it's a mental illness. This is not a mental illness as the medical community thinks. You will also find it hard to explain your experience to another person. Try to logically analyze the experien
ce when you are observing these synchronicities on a daily basis and find out logical reasons to understand that these are synchronicities or meaningful events only this is why you would see controversies for your belief. Sometimes, people will say things, just like they know you, this again another synchronicity only. Having said that, one might think that maybe my experience could be totally different than a person who had schizophrenia or human beings who have delusions similar to what I have mentioned above. Prior to these strange experiences, I had no knowledge of schizophrenia, however, since I knew that I cannot be the first person to have these strange experiences, I started researching into human experiences. I found out many similarities between my experience and human beings who are being labeled as having a mental illness. In summary, I found out that human thoughts are being affected. In other words areas of the brains, related thought perception are being affected and that has affected human act
ions. This invisible manipulation of thoughts has created synchronicities. My observation of these synchronicities and the false conclusions that I made was the reason behind my delusions. I perceived smells which shouldn't be there in my room, which means my olfactory cortex also has been affected. I had sensations which I have never experienced in my life, which means, my somatosensory cortex has been affected. I had meaningful dreams, which means, my visual cortex and brain areas related to dreams has been affected. These are the evidence and they also have faced synchronicities. 1). The following example is from the ""Psychology Today"" website. _NAME_ is a psychiatrist and his manic episodes have started at the age of 23. This is what he has to say about the synchronicities that he had faced. Source: The Manic Psychiatrist’s Experience of Synchronicity | Psychology Today _NAME_ has made a unique observation, therefore, he makes the below claim: ""Through repeated manic episodes he observed that the vol
ume of the patterns entering his awareness and the frequency of the coincidences between those patterns and his surroundings were directly proportional to the intensity of his mania. The more intense the mania, the more synchronicities."" I can not agree with _NAME_ more. After correcting my erroneous conclusions and deeply analyzing my past experiences, I could conclude the same. Let me help you understand this. As I explained earlier: 1). First synchronicities started with the friends that I stayed in the same apartment. It was only Facebook statuses/posts they shared. 2). Then synchronicities started occurring with friends who were in the same city. 3). Then friends who were living in different cities and then later friends who were living in different countries. 4). Then synchronicities started occurring through emails that I got. Email headings correlating with my life events. 5). Then I started seeing meaningful dreams as well. 6). Finally, I started seeing synchronicities through TV shows. The scripts 
of the shows correlated with my life events and at the same time live TV/Radio presenter's conversations got synchronized with my life events. Synchronicities that I started seeing through the TV scripts were extremely hard to bear, I simply couldn't go in front of the TV thinking they act and negatively talk about me. Therefore, someone could conclude that the intensity of mania would increase as the number of coincidental events or the observed patterns increased by an individual. In fact, I cannot use words to express how much anger and distress that scripts on TV shows brought me and I was paranoid too. Yet my extreme will kept me going and I still managed to logically analyze all these anomalous experiences that I was having. Looking back, it's almost like a miracle that I managed to come up with a different explanation since from my perspective, I could not find a way to see these as synchronicities or a high number of meaningful events only that correlate with my life events and thoughts. Just imagine 
this scenario, a friend of yours come to meet you every day and give you hints related to the things you did that day or things that he should not know. It would not take time for you to notice these hints since he keeps on referring to your life every day, however, when you directly address this and clarify this from your friend, he would laugh at you and ask you whether you are crazy. (my friends literally asked me the same) You will be perplexed. Although your friend rejects your accusation, the synchronicities or these meaningful events will continue. How do you understand if your friend is lying to you or not? No matter what you do, these meaningful events will keep on occurring just to fool you. From your perspective, how can you remotely think that it's not intentional and the friend actually don't know about the daily activities or your life events that he should not know? It's almost impossible to find this out because of the high number of synchronicities that you would face on a daily basis. Due to 
this tricky situation, human beings on Earth cannot understand the truth of Gangstalking phenomenon. People who have this belief are facing complicated synchronicities exhibiting a group stalking behavior on a daily basis. Not being able to understand the actions performed by individuals are not intentional, they end up in believing the existence of the stalking group. A detailed explanation can be found in the following article: The Ultimate Secrets Behind the Gang-Stalking Exposed! – The Ultimate Disclosure Of the Man-Made Phenomena! 2).

In my research related to synchronicities, I came across with this unique human experience, however, this is something you would remotely believe to have taken place. I took this specifically since this will to show how this synchronicity connects with the experiences of people who claim that they are being targeted by phenomenally advanced technology. You will not find a rational explanation for th
e below case. I'm also a firsthand experiencer of this strange phenomenon. Source: https://tomkenyon.com/synchronicities You would how the above experience correlates with the experience of a person who believes being targeted by a technology: http://sharonpoet-ti.blogspot.com/p/...xperience.html 13). This is what _NAME_ has to say about his experience: _NAME_ says: ""I'd be a thinking of someone in my head and there they'd be on the street and it''s always. I still get it or they text me. Again ahead of the other day. I was actually talking to my friend about someone else hadn't text me for ages. They text me. And this is why my mind is like oh my god I'm on the _NAME_ show because you know all these things happen and you know song is playing in my head and it's on the radio , it comes on the radio I felt like I was being possessed by something else all the words that were coming out of my mouth it was like they weren't my own and I was sort of pointing at people and just shouting, all the cars"" - https://y
outu.be/D5XdrG5mf5Y 14). Further, this is what happened to _NAME_ delusions. Simply by challenging his views, this therapist has managed to cure the delusion. This also proves that delusions are again due to an erroneous conclusion only. (This study has been carried out at the Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)) ""Behavioural Experiment: Setting up a confrontation Next, the therapist approached _NAME_ belief that a particular policeman led the persecution of him. This policeman had worked in the drug squad. _NAME_ believed that because he had sold drugs this policeman hunted him. _NAME_ delusion was based on an actual person, so the policeman (now living in another city) was contacted to see if he would meet with _NAME_. The therapist explained the background for this rather peculiar request to the policeman, and he agreed to meet them to answer specific questions _NAME_ had prepared for him. The meeting was set up as a behavioral experiment, and _NAME_ was given t
wo tasks: To prepare concrete questions for the meeting, and to hypothesize how the policeman would look, behave, speak and answer his questions. The questions and hypotheses with the expected outcome were formulated as a questionnaire prior to the meeting. A tape recorder 17 was used during the meeting to ensure accuracy in later discussions between the therapist and _NAME_. As anticipated from the therapist's phone call with the police officer, the officer proved to be competent and understanding and had no problems handling _NAME_ questions and accusations. The meeting resulted in _NAME_ becoming more certain that this policeman could not be a part of the plot against him"" https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/_PHONE_NO_.pdf Since I understood that my brain areas related to thought perception and other areas are being affected and since I understood that synchronicities are the reason behind above delusions, I doubted about voices too. Here I made an assumption that the area related to human Auditory Cortex mus
t have been affected too if the technology is behind voices. If voices are indeed due to a hidden technology, what are the observations that a person would expect to see? Therefore, this made me carry out another specific research to understand if voices would show abnormal abilities and these are my findings. Case Study I: http://hvn.forumatic.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1203 ""I am now happy to say that I still do hear voices, yes... and we get along great (and will forever continue to do so). My voices really helped me to become a better, stronger person, and sometimes they still do the devil voice when they are in a joking mood.

Case Study IV: http://hvn.forumatic.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=551 ""The voices constantly told me they were never leaving, and that Iâ€™d have to learn to deal with it. They told me that our entire society is inside of a quantum computer, and t

The voices constantly asked me questions about my memory and asked what medications I was taking, whenever I took pills. I could hear these voices clear as day, as if through a radio of some kind. On a few occasions, I actually saw people that correlated with the voices, faint visual hallucinations. Mind you, prior to all of this, I led a fairly normal life with no history of psychosis or mental disorders, except mild PTSD and ADD."" Case Study V: http://www.intervoiceonline.org/about-voices ""My subliminal voice always kept me safe at dangerous times and safe from dangerous people. I always seemed to know most events in advance, and this protected me and my family from nasty stuff.

ate and I experienced qi cong resonance within a month. This seemed to help me a lot with my health issues.

"" Case Study X: None of these might still convince you if my conclusion behind the cause of these synchronicities that I faced or the voices, is true.

Which means, not only delusions need medications, neither voices need medications to disappear.

The Shilin District Court sentenced _PERSON_ to life in prison for the murder in February last year. According to the district

Source: https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3159226 Therefore, I found more evidence concluding the same, schizophrenia and the above delusions are due to a hidden technology that exists in the world without our awareness. If so this will address my observations, even the observations related to weather phenomenon(sudden rains), power disruptions, Internet disruptions, levitation, etc... and this must have been existing on Earth for thousands and thousands of years, it's origin would be hard to imagine. If that is true, we have to conclude that an extremely advanced artificial intelligence is monitoring human activi
ties through a satellite-grid. Way back in the past a group of human beings must have deployed this system for surveillance/control purposes. Which also mean that there must have been a highly advanced global society existed way back in the past but after some catastrophic events, these families must be running an invisible rule on Earth. Which is again like opening a can of worms thus requires more evidence. If not what could be the reason behind my observations according to your thinking? Thereafter, I continued my research to understand this mystery on Earth and this research gave me evidence that this technology has been existing on Earth for thousands and thousands of years without our knowledge. Further, I had to conclude that because of this technology, the UFO researchers also have ended up in having an erroneous conclusion to claim that aliens are visiting the Earth. This is why such theories again contradict when we analyze human experiences. Further insight into this mystery can be found here: http
s://theultimatedisclosure.com/uf...of_the_iceberg That said, even if we take the technology out of the equation, my experience should give an insight into how these patients can be treated. Nevertheless, this would be the tip of the iceberg. You may also read this experience related to Gangstalking.

The problem was was that they are addictive and I hadn't got many so I had to ration them and take half only when I was on the verge of a panic attack, which meant I was still feeling crippling anxiety. The SSRIs I was very afraid of. I read lots of bad reports online and the main reason I didn't end up taking them was because I was terrified they would give me depression or numb my emotions. I know that they work well for lots of people and that's amazing if they do! But I have anxiety about taking them and I feel my brain already has negative outlook from reading bad things online, which I probably shouldn't do. I went to the doctors and told her that I didn't want to take the SSRIs just yet and I wanted more Xanax and she prescribed me Beta Blockers instead. They slow my hear
t rate down and have a very similar effect to the benzodiazapines. The great thing about BBs are that they are not addictive so I could take them every day if I wanted. The doctor recommended that I took them every day for a month but I decided to use them the same as the Xanax and just take them when I feel panic attacks coming. This means I'm not becoming reliant on medication. Mindfulness meditation has been an absolute saviour! I did it 3 times a day sometimes it has completely changed the way I think! I have tried so many methods from life coach videos, _NAME_ talks, podcasts, apps, documentaries and one thing that I find really helpful is finding out other people's stories and how the deal with their struggles. So thanks again for your amazing help! I completely agree with what you say about not worrying when it will happen or if it will go away. As soon as I accepted anxiety as a normal things that happens to many many people I didn't feel so afraid anymore. When I can feel it now I kind of just think 
'do your worst' and I don't feel so bad. It's still scary and I know it will always reoccur and just happy I know that it will pass! I also started to realise that there was no factual evidence that I was going crazy, and this had all been my anxiety. Once I realised this, I started to relax more. I'm far from being fixed but I'm getting there Like you say I will never be rid of it but as each day passes I'm slowly becoming my old self again and its unrecognisable to those around me! I have just started CBT I actually have my second session tomorrow"

175920730,"Also weight loss tips from a science major who has taken many courses that taught about weight loss, nutrition, etc. The best way to lose weight and KEEP IT OFF -do not try to lose weight rapidly, aim for 1 lb a week, slow weight loss is more likely to stay off, this is because it gives your body time to adjust to a new metabolism and weight, if you lose weight too rapidly your body thinks you are starving and food is scare in the environment, this switches it into survival mode where it wants to store fat and the second you eat bad again or stop restricting calories you will gain all the weight back, also it is just not healthy to lose tons of weight rapidly and be in starvation mode there are many cons to health -exercise AND change your diet: as I posted recently, if you just change your diet you are emptying out fat cells but not getting rid of them, thus if you eat bad again or too much they will fill up again and you will gain weight back quickly, if you exercise and can change these fat cell
s to muscle they will be gone and your metabolism speeds up making it easier to lose weight and keep it off! -Weigh yourself every day to keep yourself accountable, the best time to weigh yourself is right after you wake up before you eat anything as you will not have any water weight or food weight on you, you can have as much as a 2 lb difference between your morning and evening weights!! And never weigh yourself while wet that can add on a ton of weight and give you an inaccurate reading, even if you’re just kind of damp."

Also I think stress is the mechanism by which my voices sometimes happen. ‘main’ or ‘faint’ they are one. Also it never happened to me before that I would get voices when stressed so this is all new to me. I was used to having voices all the time so I didn’t notice them if I got stressed.

It turned out to be exactly what I needed....I am seeing things in clarity like never before. I began to realize maybe my baseline has been mild psychosis for at least the last few years. But now, things are changing. The nurse confirmed I have been dealing with psychosis for some time now. This is so hard. But I feel like clozapine is my ticket to freedom.

175920785,"In the context of mental illness, seeking attention is a very good thing. We can’t deal with everything ourselves. We need support from outside sources. That’s the nature of being sick. Therapy, CMHT calls, pdoc visits, these are all types of attention, but they’re also the necessary treatment for our illness. Even outside the context of mental illness, all humans need attention. We are social creatures, and pretending to be overly self-sufficient really harms the human brain. Human interaction is a human need, right up there with food, water, and shelter. Knowing when to ask for help and then accepting the help offered is a sign of strength. You’re stronger when you rely on your social supports. You’ve been trying to give up drinking, and that’s not something most people manage without a strong social safety net. I personally love when people ask for help or attention, because they are relying on useful coping methods to get them through hard times, rather than self-destructing."

I slept in a back bedroom on an old mattress on the floor and 4/5 of the floor was used as a storage space for old furniture and boxes of junk. I was not happy to say the least and I called the police a couple times to take me to the psyche ward during that time. In the psyche ward they strapped me face down to a table with leather straps and some other poor guy was strapped down on a table next to me. Oh hell, those were bad times, just horrible times. But I discovered a day program at the county hospital and joined it. We played board games or Charades, or played volleyball out back and went for walks and had therapy groups. It was very informal. But a couple times after day treatment I walked next door to the psyche ward and checked myself in. Did I mention those were horrible times?

And I called them up and they fired me as a formality. Anyways, I lived with my dad and did some things in my life that really pissed him off but he stuck with me. Then in rapid succession, I moved out of my dads to a group home, I got clean and sober there, I got a job, I moved into a board & care and enrolled myself in college. I started going to AA, CA and NA meetings until I was walking or taking the bus to 5 or 6 meetings a week. I’ve been working almost steadily ever since. That is how I changed my life. Hell, I didn’t want to be addicted to crack, I didn’t want to sleep on the floor, I didn’t want to be in the psyche ward, I didn’t want to be in that day program, I didn’t want to be broke and unemployed. But I was 29 years old and all of those things. So I changed my life and changed all those things. Now I li
ve in an OK apartment, my job ain’t bad at all, I have a nice 2012 Volkswagen Jetta, I take one online class at a time. I shop, cook and clean for myself. I have a couple grand in the bank and take care of my own finances. Sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m not. But just forcing myself to do things that sucked at the time got me this place. My motto is the NIKE shoe motto: “Just Do It”. I still do a lot of things I don’t like doing and I have a few toxic people in my life, but all in all, my life ain’t that bad all the time. Change ain’t easy most of the time, it can be very uncomfortable and difficult but I’m glad I went down the path I did when I was younger. The _NAME_ Band has that famous song “Jet Airliner” A line goes, “You got to go through hell before you get to heaven.” That couldn’t be truer. Nothing good comes easy. But I showed how I was down like a 100% of us are at many points in our lives, living with my dad with zero going for me except that I took some risks. And i
t payed off. I hope someone gets something from this."

175920823,"I think of vaping like this. imagine taking a spoon and pouring splenda or sweet and low on it, then adding a few drops of liquid and putting a lighter to it wait for it to bubble then with a straw inhale the freebase. Thats essentially what you do when you vape. your freebasing sugar alcohols oh but plus nicotene. sounds crazy when you say it that way right?"
175920824,What if one hasn’t got any sz genetics? There’s no one in my family except me that has sza (or sz). And psychosis? Did I even experience any truly? Or did I just make it up? Psychosis is such a tricky word! Aren’t voices and delusions arbitrary and subjective?

175920829,"The orthodox view is that what you eat doesn’t affect the body’s pH balance since it is so tightly regulated, but they act as if you could eat any amount of acidic foods without consequence. The key here is the alkaline buffer. Most people are depleted in the minerals that comprise it due to the standard American diet, so their well-being suffers while the body barely maintains the low end of the livable pH range (around 7.35.) The body depletes alkaline calcium from bones to maintain that, too. Osteoporosis, anyone?"

175920831,"Just that sometimes its hard to find an imaginary reference that can be a valid match to the data I want to refer. I mostly use rhymes, acronyms and visual imagery to help me remember. I may not always be able to find valid examples of those for what I am trying to remember when I want to. I was recently trying to learn a new alphabet by matching the shape of the letter to a sound starting with an image ref that matched the image. Like if the letter La looked like a ‘lame person’ or ‘lake’…didnt always find a image to match the sound."

175920848,"I had the worst experience. I was going through trauma after trauma and eventually suffered delusions. Which revolves around my trauma. I was have severe panic attacks and hyper vigilance from ptsd. Was currently seeing a psychologist who tested me at the beginning and never showed signs of bipolar. I do have deep, anxiety, add inattentive type and now cptsd. She twisted my words so I stopped talking to her and she still continued to right reports that I was having delusions she had me on RespirDol and I told my therapist I was having anxiety and restless and she suggest I get off so I asked dr to switch meds well she was unethical in her Choice because invega sustenna is the essentially the same thing. I was sexually assaulted by the The janitor. I told him mail tack and he never said anything. So then I told a female nurse and she got the ball rolling but they only did an internal investigation and they told me that I wouldn’t hear anything back. When I tried to call the police to make a report 
they took my phone privileges. They did not have a sexual abuse counselor there to help me get through it so I just stuffed my feelings so I could get out of there. In my report she said I was manipulating in order to get released however there’s camera footage. She gave me my a loading dose of in Vega four days later gave me the shot and released me that same day. I went to a treatment center down in Florida still psychotic to them anyway I believe what they defined as delusions is just an interest in conspiracy theories. After the shower I started suffering from restlessness anxiety agitation severe bloating leaking from my breast emotional dysregulation defiant closed off all symptoms of extraparametal side effects from the medications the doctor there put me on two more antipsychotics so that was a total of four including Vistaril. I felt trapped and re-traumatized. Nobody would listen to me about my childhood traumas and how I was experiencing hypervigilance and arousal from all the stress bullying my 
husband taking my kids and cheating on me until eventually I went into delusions. I complained about my symptoms and was disregarded and I tried to go home and they wouldn’t let me so I walked out and they _PERSON_ acted me into a psych unit for five days that’s when I decided I had to conform and the only way I was going to get out of there and escape was to do and say what they wanted. After leaving I lasted a week with the symptoms before I checked myself back into another psychiatric unit terrified but I had no choice it was either that or use drugs to escape my restlessness. When I got there the doctor immediately diagnosed me with extraparametal side effects and prolactinoma I was at the other place for 34 days undiagnosed dismissed was handed a packet called queen baby and when I tried to leave a second time to call the police to say they were holding me against my will the director basically cornered me and you scare tactics saying that’s not gonna work out well for you insinuating that I would 
go back to the psychiatric unit. I feel abused and neglected and last week I was diagnosed with PCOS hey syndrome I may have to live with for the rest of my life. I’ve tried to call attorneys to help me however the damages won’t make them enough money to take my case. I’m considering exposing them I’m hurt confused and don’t understand howThese centers can treat me that way. I felt dehumanized trapped alone and bullying. It only contributed to my symptoms of PTSD I was so overmedicated it’s clear in the reports that day after day after day I Suffered but they just kept saying I was in psychosis and I was miss diagnosed with bipolar. Two months I didn’t get to see my children. Two months I will never get back. And JusticeI will never get. Signed irrelevant"
175920849,Had a good day but scared of my thoughts. I'm not deserving of feeling better. Not deserving of good days and that everything will crumbling down and I'll never have a peace of mind.

175920855,I would like to have some money. I would like to have some sense of security. My parents don’t have anything set aside for me—now or in the future. My father makes a decent salary and is working non-stop so I have been targeted by banks when I try to become independent. I’m being pressured to get SSI but I don’t have a car and in the middle of a pandemic so I have absolutely nothing assisting me in finding a job/work. My friends have all ghosted me I guess because I am so pathetic. But I don’t know what else to do than to live with my mom or I would be destitute and homeless. Is that normal? Is having a mental illness a good excuse to keep someone trapped in poverty? I’ve never had more than $1200 in my bank account. That is not normal and I am learning this–its not that I do not want to work nor have lack of skillsets. I just want to succeed or have some security/stability.
175920856,Are you really losing your home? That really sucks. You live in an expensive part of the country.
175920857,"This must be the case. I am only level one, so I guess with this new levelling system they’re using perhaps if you were a level 3 you must have chronic psychosis?

175920858,No interest in sex just snuggles. Oh I would have sex with the right man and I would make it be fun but I wouldn’t orgasm. I haven’t had an orgasm since I started taking aps. They ruin that for me. But it’s ok I had more than my fair share when I was younger.

Going on and off your meds too many times and they may stop working altogether, then you will have no relief from your suffering. If you are fine without meds then you’re lucky and that is a different story. However, if you are doing well with meds, and the side effects are minimal or tolerable I would recommend you stay on them"

175920900,Many of us including myself have done exactly that. That’s how I learned it was meds for life for me. The problem is there’s a danger of losing “insight” when you come off meds. I.e. getting more unwell but being unaware that you are. Also the meds take time to build up into system again (like a month) to start working. So that’s another danger.

You don’t need to disclose that the sick member of your family you were caring for was you. If pressed for info, just demur and say that you’re not ready to talk about it yet. It works and it’s close enough to the truth. Lying is a thing to be avoided."

175920929,"Are your vitals ok? Heart rate? Blood pressure? My beta blocker slows my heart rate so the first day I took it, I went up to my mom like ""I can't take a deep breath in!!"" and she said ""Yeah that's normal with beta blockers. I've noticed that too when I started mine. It took me around 2 weeks and then I got used to it"" so I got used to it eventually. And yes olanzepine and opies aren't a good mix... But they can be taken under supervision.. So your doctor should be supervising you more about your meds and giving you more information. He sounds like ... a common doctor unfortunately.. ""Pulmonary embolism is the sudden blockage of a major blood vessel (artery) in the lung, usually by a blood clot. In most cases, the clots are small and are not deadly, but they can damage the lung."" Maybe you have a small blood clot in your lung.. possibly from smoking.. Or build up of tar from smoking that could go away... I'd talk to your doctor again. It's called dyspnea. Causes of dyspnea are; Causes of short
ness of breath include asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, anemia, lung cancer, inhalation injury, pulmonary embolism, anxiety, COPD, high altitude with lower oxygen levels, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, subglottic stenosis, interstitial lung disease, ... etc... So it could also be anxiety or a form of OCD or something concerning plus that, making you worry more. I hope things turn out ok!"

174333489,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The effects of age and sex on cognitive impairment in schizophrenia: Findings from the Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS) study. _NAME_, _PERSON_ Green, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, LC _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Light, AD _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Stone, _PERSON_ Sugar, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PloS one, 2020 Recently emerging evidence indicates accelerated age-related changes in the structure and function of the brain in schizophrenia, raising a question about its potential consequences on cognitive function. Using a large sample of schizophrenia patients and controls and a battery of tasks across multiple cognitive domains, we examined whether patients show accelerated age-related decline in cognition and whether an age-related effect differ between females and males. We utilized data of 1,415 schizophrenia patients and 1,062 healthy community collected by the second phase of the Consortium 
on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS-2). A battery of cognitive tasks included the Letter-Number Span Task, two forms of the Continuous Performance Test, the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition, the Penn Emotion Identification Test and the Penn Facial Memory Test. The effect of age and gender on cognitive performance was examined with a general linear model. We observed age-related changes on most cognitive measures, which was similar between males and females. Compared to controls, patients showed greater deterioration in performance on attention/vigilance and greater slowness of processing social information with increasing age. However, controls showed greater age-related changes in working memory and verbal memory compared to patients. Age-related changes (?2p of 0.001 to .008) were much smaller than between-group differences (?2p of 0.005 to .037). This study found that patients showed continued decline of cognition on some domains but stable impairment or even less decline on other domains 
with increasing age. These findings indicate that age-related changes in cognition in schizophrenia are subtle and not uniform across multiple cognitive domains."

175920940,I mean think of all the monks that live in poverty. Obviously they arent all stupid. They just had a different calling. I think many are called for that or other things like that or other poverty situations. Poverty isnt a disease by itself.

I couldn’t use them as a work reference. I sent in 24+ job applications with no interviews. Some of my work at Goodwill was physical stuff I volunteered to do.

175920947,"There’s something wrong with that way of thinking and I know it has happened to others. Because , when you are yourself and you say you can’t, what happens to ones soul when you do it - it gets lost, right? And that lost soul is angry upon returning.

175920953,I take it for anxiety.
175920954,I’m really not that social but it also depends how comfortable I am with other people. Strangers kind of make me uneasy. I have to know the person and feel comfortable with them before I converse with them.

Get your meds right and move from there. Not being able to function is a serious sign your meds aren’t working right. Talk to your treatment team and ask for results.

175920970,"That’s unfortunate, I feel fantastic when I take it. As I mentioned earlier it has about a 12 hour half life. That means it take 12 hours for 1/2 of the medication to leave your body. After 24 hours only 1/4 will be left, after 2 days only 1/16 will be left. So it should wear off within a day or two. It takes about 4-5 half lives before most medications lose all therapeutic effect."

175920978,I have a busy day tomorrow along with intrusive thoughts and long volunteer hours. I hope I will be safe no more threats and people saying they are going to shoot or torture me. I am thankful to all those who have helped and supported me especially my family. I wish for a normal life. I hate when people say insensitive remarks or even worse.

First, I would like to apologize for my behavior, posts, and what I said before I left. I was angry, upset, and mean to those around here. I hope I can come back. I am sorry. I realize I hurt people and that I was not thinking straight. I still think about how rude I was and would like to apologize and say I am sorry. Hopefully, I can get a second chance. I hope I can come back to this site again. With that being said, I think I am doing better with my schizo-affective disorder. But I am lonely and my grandmother just died a few days ago.

I have none really. Even my only friend has not talked to me and the same goes for me. I have lost that connection. I sometimes think I don’t need people, but I do. I realize now that I was really unstable for the longest time. I still have flairups though and end up down the rabbit hole sometimes. I try to correct myself sometimes too. I use facebook only and sometimes when my symptoms flair up I go back to my old self and talk about what I thought happened to me or my theories on life, real and unreal. I try to correct myself. My psychosis is minimal right now and I’m happy and hopeful and stable. I would like to finish my college someday and rely on myself more. I hope to recover more and will ask for more strattera next time. I also am really excited and interested in ITI-007 or lumateperone, the newest AP that works

175920990,"_AT_MENTION_ I think I have recurrent psychosis too. I have had only 1 hallucination in my entire life. But I have had multiple episodes where I become unconscious but try to harm myself. Also, I dont think docs really understand the condition either. Psychologists may help with CBT but psychiatrists just want to give chemicals that Big Pharma is selling. They learn the ‘truth’ about us from talking to us but have already decided that we are deluded when they talk. How can you learn the truth from someone you already consider is imagining everything? I have found peace with my mental techniques, not the meds. I am going to ask my doc to reduce both my anti-anxiety meds next time I see him. See how that works for my mind. Still sticking to my anti-psychotics and antic-onvulsants."

Not being able to dance or listen to music in front of him. Yet we do have good times too. Cuddles. Chats. Hugs. Sharing. But things so temporary then the strain and arguments return.

175921017,"That last 15% is hard for get rid of. I want to know what normal feels like. For me its also seasonal. I dont get bad winter depression like I did years ago, I get some just because I dont like the 6 months of life/living everyday changes winter brings. Winter is a big hassle, but better than hurricanes and widespread fire- thus, Im not moving. My anxiety will certainly increase from lack of daylight, and like clockwork, its slowly knocking at my door this last few weeks losing 2-3 min of daylight each day. This used to be really bad for the decades I had lyme (from that forum), and I learned many ways to help with the nastyness of anxiety thru natural health and supplements. Lyme magnifies whats already wrong with your body , in addition to its own symptoms, becoming a complete body illness. What is does to the nervous system and possibly of developing autoimmune issues is what the lasting affect is all about in ""chronic lyme"". _PERSON_ helped many people on that form deal with this, but dealing 
with it and eliminating it are different. Ive come so close but the last remainder may (will)9 require a different approach than suppliments that only go so far and might create their own issues.

I need physical and mental space. Yes, I joke that I'm a space Cadette lol! Ive dumb downed my job choices to simplify my life, job boredom is not good, but is better than stress and unachievable modern deadlines. I have many hands on hobbies/interests which is both good and bad. With moderation it keeps my mind happy doing things I love, but I get get so much going on sometimes that I'll make my own anziety. As far as relationships, anxiety and my space requirements kills it. I find the constant effort, maintenance, and extra cost required equals more daily anxiety, so its just not worth the effort for me. Its easier for me to just be al
one which kind of sucks but thats the honest truth (wish it wasn't). I can easily entertain myself easily for free, just go outside or get lost in my shop projects (simple, logical, down to earth, ""crazy skills/ engineer"", introvert here).... with anxiety. Its funny how the better you get from a chronic condition (lyme), the more 100% normal you still crave. Its like 80-90% well is not good enough anymore. thanks for any thoughts/ideas.

( not _PERSON_), lived alone and did not appear to socialize with anyone on a regular basis. _NAME_, the fella across the street, would proactively (value added! ) do heavy work for Mr. _PERSON_., such as uprooting and disposing of a small dead sapling from Mr. _PERSON_.'s front lawn. Daily, without fail, Mr. _PERSON_. went for walks of several miles. In winter, he would shovel snow from his own sidewalk. In summer, he would mow his own lawn. He was solitary and independent. One summer day, the neighbor kid stopped by to say, ""Hi."", and discovered that Mr. _PERSON_. had died quietly, sitting in a folding chair in his driveway reading his mail. Independent to the end. After his death, I spoke with one of the firefighters who showed up for such 'events'. He said Mr. _PERSON_.'s home was, ""spotless"". * * * So, yes, lo

Although I am not Black, I am a woman of color, and did not want to incur more disapproval than my abusive mother had taught me that I already deserved by existing. So, learning to say no was an uphill battle, but I can't recommend it highly enough. * * * One thing I learned during my cancer treatment is that I fvcking loathe incompetent, lazy healthcare 'professionals' and would rather die than become a ward of the state, or enter the 'care' of a nursing hom

Web pages to that effect probably already exist."

If a normal person is drugged with AP for certain period and if AP suddenly stopped they experience positive symptoms for some period and some time it can become permanent and then require AP to manage positive symptoms. Also if a normal person is drugged with AP they can experience mild negative symptoms due to the dopamine blocking effect.

174333506,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Insight and medication adherence in schizophrenia: An analysis of the CATIE data. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropharmacology , May 2019 08 Adherence to antipsychotic medication is critical for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Impaired insight into illness is one of the principal drivers of medication nonadherence, which contributes to negative clinical outcomes. The aims of this study were to examine the relationships between impaired insight and (1) rates of antipsychotic mediation nonadherence, and (2) time to medication nonadherence using data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). Insight was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item G12 (lack of judgment and insight). Patients were divided into 3 groups based on their degree of insight impairment, i.e. no impairment (PANSS G12?=?1), minimal impairment (PANSS G12?=?2-3), and moderate
-to-severe insight impairment (PANSS G12???4). Medication nonadherence was defined as taking less than 80% of monthly pill counts. _PERSON_ survival and _PERSON_ regression analyses were performed to examine differences in time to medication nonadherence between insight groups. There were significant group differences in the percentage of nonadherent patients at 6 months (?2(2)?=?8.80, p?=?0.012) and 18 months (?2(2)?=?10.04, p?=?0.007) after study initiation. Moderate-to-severe insight impairment was associated with earlier nonadherence compared to minimal (?2?=?4.70, p?=?0.030) or no impairment (?2?=?11.92, p?=?0.001). The association remained significant after adjustment for illness severity, substance use, attitudes toward medication, cognition, level of hostility, and depression. The results of this study indicate a strong link between impaired insight and antipsychotic medication adherence. Intervention studies targeted to enhance insight may help improve medication adherence, and in turn, other clinica
l outcomes in patients with schizophrenia."

175921071,"Does anyone else remember the singularity? What it felt like to be part of an infinite zeropoint of existence. All matter, all energy, everything, as one. Pure order and connection to it all, we were all together once. I still remember the light, the warmth. It was different from oblivion. It was pleasant, but still a form of consciousness. That was before the chaos, the schism, the fracture, we all went separate ways, and unleashed our power. Our atoms forming from the heart of stars, our consciousness plucked from our wandering oblivion. All to coalesce into a physical form, by experiencing existence as a singular part of the whole we once belonged to."

Although it is hard to get into a genetics counseling program, I believe I can get into one somewhere if I try. I just have to try. I like teaching but don't believe I will have this job for a long time. The economy here is lagging and also there are too many teachers here also. I was blessed to get a job. And, I will do my best to do my job until I try to get into school again. I am so excited about these times where there are advances in science and technology. I thought about just teaching until I retire but if I can combine teaching, science, and helping others this would be amazing. I have to build my stamina though. I am always sleepy.

174333505,"Hi everyone. I saw my therapist on Saturday. In person, but we might do on the phone next time. Not sure. We'll see how the virus is doing. My therapist said she thinks I'm having more paranoia and delusions because I am working in an emotionally safer environment and getting lots of feedback which is good for me and since I am feeling safer, then it is like these feelings are coming up, only I don't know how to deal with them so they are coming out in paranoia and delusions. She's not sure. That's her hypothesis. But it sounds good. I do think I have a safer environment emotionally at work. The hallucinations have been good, like really good, since upping the Rexulti to 4 mg. But I'm out of it now so I am hoping that it gets delivered today. If not I think I have some 3 mg's but that didn't help the hallucinations as much. They are doing really well on the 4's. My self destructiveness has been pretty good lately as well. Not feeling so much ugh bad feelings. I slept a lot this weekend. I went to C

I’ve had muscle twitching also and did not connect it to medicine for 5 years. But the twitching was connected to a medicine I was taking (Mirtazapine anti-depressant).

For the first 3 years (taking 15 mg.), I made no connection between taking the Mirtazapine at 12 midinight, and by toes starting to twitch 30-45 minutes later, plus my appetite increasing to where I had to get up and have a snack. Due to circumstances, the connection dawned on me and my psychiatrist reduced the med to 7.5 from 15 mg and I thought all was taken care of. For the last 2 years on 7.5 mg, I would have occasional toe twitching but it has increased, followed by getting up and having another snack. So I get to bed at 12 midnight, and at 5 a.m. I have yet to get to sleep. Two days ago for the first time, I connected all of that, so I took my Mirtazapine not at midnight, but 5 hours earlier at 7 p.m., hoping the side effects would wear off at midnight, and they did and I slept from 12 midnight to 8 a.m.. about the SSRI Lexapro (treats anxiety and depression net says), Webmd.com says under rare side 
effects: A Feeling Of Restlessness With Inability To Sit Still Muscle Tremors Cramps And under “Side Effects, 5th paragraph: “twitching muscles”. By clicking on “twitching muscles” in the 5th paragraph of Side Effects, it said: ""Twitches. Unlike tics, the majority of muscle twitches are isolated occurrences, not repeated actions. Muscle twitches are also known as myoclonic jerks. They are entirely involuntary and cannot be controlled or suppressed."" So I would say SSRI’s can cause twitching muscles. You also said, “Recently, and even before going back on the Lexapro (after being off of that for 8 months), I’ve had the annoying and worrisome twitches and spasm in my left breast muscle.” Trying to figure out what to do after finding out the SSRI’s can cause muscle twitching I’m finding to also be a problem. I’m trying to take my Mirtazapine 5 hours early. But the twitching toes starts only about an hour or two after taking the medicine, so I maybe I can take it 2 hours before bedtime. 
You might also use a heating pad as a combination approach to working on this issue of muscle twitching. Anyway, that’s the situation as I see it."

175921151,40mg perphenazine. It’s working well for me. Definitely not overmedicated.
175921152,"For sleep, I take Melatonin from the health food store, although it may be sold in drug stores and grocery stores in the health food section. It's not a doctor medication so I don't consider it a drug. However, I also take Lithium stabilizer and Mirtazapine anti-depressant, since I'm bipolar. Without taking those two meds, and just by taking a Melatonin or two, I'm not going to sleep. With emotional issues, like bipolar, I need doctor meds to take care of that. Then, if I can't sleep, the Melatonin might and does help. So, if you're going to wing it without meds with your anxiety attacks, that also might include side issues such as sleepless nights. As they say, the lack of sleep may not be the main problem, it could be only a sign of something deeper, like anxiety attacks. If you decide you're not going to treat the anxiety attacks, you're probably not going to be able to treat the sleep problem with _NAME_ food products. I've been off meds and tried to treat my sleep problem with a health food it
em and it didn't work. You may find different. As for Melatonin, I take 4 (1 mg) an hour or more before bedtime, 1 at bedtime, and if I wake up at 3 a.m. and can't get back to sleep, I might take another one. (Although some Melatonin now comes with extended release, meaning it can slowly release over hours of time. I've had anxiety attacks and once it breaks free in your brain, it seems to set up a pattern for it to occur again. My 1st anxiety attack was from being treated with an antipsychotic med for my bipolar that did not suit me at all. My 2nd group of anxiety attacks was from being treated only for depression when what I really had was manic depression. The anti-depressant alone (with no stabilizer like Lithium which I now take) pushed me into mania and anxiety attacks. Since Lithium was added to the anti-depressant, I've had no more anxiety attacks in 25 years. I think there is a correlation. Medicine has side affects but not taking medicine can have side affects also. You're experiencing two of those.

175921155,"Hey guys, havn’t been on here for a while! You will probably remember me as ""I Like Turtles. and then the whole site crashes I’ve been doing well. I seem to have recovered/remitted from the psychotic and mood portion of my disorder. I have had hardly any issues with it since october 2019. I have been doing maintenance rtms treatments basically every 2 weeks since september 2019. That has stabilized me. Still been dealing with fatigue/ hypersomnia/inattention. Gave modafinil a go twice but no help with that one. With this whole pandemic ordeal going on my rtms treatments have been cancelled until further notice so I talked to my psychiatrist about taking something to hold me over and keep me functioning so I can keep learning and going about daily activities. Just started a trial with ritalin. So far it seems to be of help, and it seems to reduce anxiety for me, probably because it slows my thoughts down, and oddly I don’t seem to have any crash from it. it kind of feels like a better acting 
form of caffeine. the pychiatrist is pretty confident I have low probability of mania with taking it as I havn’t had mania in years. its also possible im dealing with innatentive adhd along with the bipolar stuff. so that is the next part of the brain equation… but erring on the side of caution i still have risperidone if needed, or if i want to take lamictal i can.

175921167,"Yes, it sounds much better."
175921168,"True. If you've not read it, I'd suggest you read ""Man's Search for Meaning,"" by _PERSON_. It's a relatively short book that outlines how the Jewish psychologist endured through the Nazi concentration camps during WWII. He lost his whole family but came out of the process to develop a new therapy method that would change the way therapy worked. It's main message is that of choice, but you need to have something to choose to find that way forward, which is what his therapy seeks to uncover. I think the biggest problems are not the most severe; they're the relatively common ones that just keep going, as they become exhausting. You constantly see people who go through massive trauma, losing limbs, acute illness etc, and they come out of the other end determined to climb a mountain or whatever, fighting for a cause. You can focus on that; there's a seen 'enemy' and a way forward. The sort of problems that seem to disable people psychologically are the ones where there is no time-frame and no fixing t
he issue. _PERSON_ made the observation that the prisoners who had family who were killed actually survived better than the ones who had no family to start with. There was a focus for their pain. Lack of cash, chronic pain, unemployment, poor living conditions, etc., they're not dramatic enough to get sympathy from others and there's no end in sight."

175921178,So I took Geodon back in 2018 for about 6 months. I had sleeping problems since before starting on it so I don’t know if I’m a good one to say whether is caused the sleeping problems or not. I didn’t experience weight gain on it though. At the time I was taking 80mg twice a day. Now fast forward to present time I only went back on it about a week ago and now I’m on 40mg twice a day. Trying to keep the dose lower to reduce possibly sedating side effects. I’ve been having big problems sleeping but I’m also not taking any Trazodone like I used to.

175921180,Thank you so much for your insight into anxiety and what works for you _NAME_. There are so many meds for depression and anxiety it just seems trial and error in finding one that works. I hated amitriptyline as it just made me so sleepy. I know its an older med which my GI dr said was best for IBS symptoms. The Cymbalta was ordered by pain management team. It does work well for nerve damage pain but has not helped my anxiety much. I will keep searching for something to help me. As you said having your parents moving near you and your job made things so stressful for you. I know all about that as my strong willed father in law now lives with us and he is not sensitive to any other position than his own. My wife even wishes this had not happened.

175921181,"TAK-041, a GPR139 agonist for anhedonia GPR139 (G protein-coupled receptor 139) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GPR139 gene. GPR139 is an orphan G-protein–coupled receptor expressed in the central nervous system. The expression pattern of GPR139 has primarily been studied on the mRNA level and showed expression mainly in the central nervous system. GPR139 is an orphan receptor identified from bioinformatics analysis of the human genome. GPR139 is thus a potential target for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, obesity, eating disorders, and/or diabetes. The GPR139 is expressed specifically in the brain in areas of relevance for motor control. GPR139 function and signal transduction pathways are elusive, and results in the literature are even contradictory. GPR139 agonists dose-dependently protect primary dopaminergic (DA) neurons against MPP+ toxicity."

175921189,"As someone who has studied various spiritualities for years and studies under a teacher of mysticism, I think it all comes down to the same point: “you have control of your mind”. You have the choice to follow negative thought patterns or create new, positive ones. Hallucinations, if focused in a spiritual direction, can increase your awe of the universe and gratitude to be in it, but the most important part of a spiritual practice should ultimately be how to benefit those you love and the world at large. If hallucinations make this difficult, they should be ignored and blocked. Otherwise, nothing on our beautiful Earth will change. Psychosis is only spiritually beneficial if you are focusing on love and gratitude, otherwise, you will end up riddled with delusions thinking you are Gd’s literal gift to mankind. It will boost your ego. I’ve been there. I prefer serving other people and being stable a lot more. I am thankful for medications, positive attitudes, and my spiritual teacher. I woul

The thing that worries me most is the age gap (10 years) _AT_MENTION_ Thanks. Right now i´m having the energy and will power to diet and do some exercise plus studying a bit. Which I consider the basis of my life; the rest of the time is spent allowing myself to do nothing. About the smoking… I think I want to loose weight first. I don´t see myself going through that now. Btw if you are feeling dumb, just play a music instrument! Moreover, if you can allow yourself to improvise you don´t even need to read music, just listen and play back.

175921248,"If you are looking to find the physical brain disorder, one that can be treated, and usually to the point of cure, while also being an infection that mainstream medicine will not currently acknowledge, consider Lyme. 3M people a year get it in the US, most without initially noticing, and since most are rarely diagnosed we have ongoing infections that average about a third of US Americans will be infected in our lifetimes. You want to find out early because it can progress quickly and stubbornly and be expensive. At any rate, I am experiencing anxiety lately which I don't have much of a history of until the last few years. I had cleared up a Bartonella infection and then this Babesia red blood cell brain infection then grew like a new infection. Mostly I experience anxiety, fatigue, brain fog, brain pressure and sometimes odd but not particularly painful brain sensations. There are half a dozen diseases you can get from a tick and they are collectively called Lyme. I hope this helps and if it does, 
please come back and help others."

Didn’t join in play with my brother and sister Didn’t appear to be interested… Physically awkward and clumsy. My sister doesn’t recall me having any friends in childhood. That also sums up the teenage years quite well. Was bullied quite badly during the teenage years.

175921256,"I’m a middle child. My entire existence until age 12 or so was comprised entirely of attention seeking behavior. Then I landed myself in abusive relationship after abusive relationship and learned really fast how to not bring any attention to myself. As for how it relates to sz, I did sort of fake symptoms for awhile. They had me on invega and I was super delusional. So I had this belief that if I could convince them I just had symptoms of physical health problems they would let me leave the psych ward. Unfortunately for me, I’m a terrible liar and was very visibly off my rocker. And those delusions included thinking I had the ability to kill people off they heard my voice. So I was terrified to talk. Lol Damn I have no idea how I ever thought I was sane back then. I was ??????? loony toons."

There are some truly caring and respectful people here for the most part. However. One of my red lines was that if I got to the stage where I had to ignore or mute anybody, that would signal to me that it was time to give up and leave. This is compounded further by the way in which the software hides things, as it doesn’t completely remove them from view. Anyway that’s not the point.

When I told my manager that I have schizophrenia, he breathed heavily and the first question he asked me was whether I was on medication. Months later, my manager did not tell me but he actually wrote a blog post on my company’s intranet saying how great an employee I am. I wrote an article on the intranet telling people of schizophrenia to lower the _USER_ID_ and it was sent to many departments within my bank. I was invited to speak on two separate conferences for two entire departments. I feel that my words and actions have touched many in my bank and afffected the perception of even senior executives. However, i cannot do this alone, more people will need to speak up."

174333558,"For starters, it’s saying sugar doesn’t cause inflammation, when studies show it does. Curcumin doesn’t lower the inflammation marker TBARS very much, so it might not be a useful anti-inflammatory. And it’s true that chronic inflammation isn’t the outright cause of much illness, like it just happened in a vacuum, there’s a whole pathology of bad habits leading up to it. It’s just a treatable illness vector. For instance, with mental illnesses like schizophrenia, a weak blood-brain barrier is typically the cause of chronic brain inflammation, and healing the BBB offers a more permanent solution rather than taking mass anti-inflammatories."

Would like to do 10% per month as is best practice it seems. My doc seems OK with 20% Anyway, what are your opinions on this? Has anyone here( non- bipolar or indeed BP) tapered Lithium succèssfully?

She has been throwing up or having diarrhea, sneezing a lot, she isn't always going potty in her box--so maybe urinary tract infection or kidney infection, she doesn't want to be held much or cuddled with. So just a lot of stuff going on with her. I had to cancel my T appointment for that day so I am waiting to hear back from T to see if she can see me the next week.

175921494,"In 2015, it felt like they were reading my mind or my mind was open or being accessed. That people could see through my eyes. I largely recovered years later, but that was at my worst. Oddly, I was in the hospital at the time. The medicine did not work. I think time heals everything. I still got symptoms but it’s mild. I also thought I was psychic and could hear or listen to people talking about me or knew people were planning on hurting me. Was it a delusion? Not sure about the latter. The doctor gave me adderall which I could not remember taking for years. I still dont know for certain. Maybe I did try it and it made me very sick. I also was messing with supplements like aniracetam which my doctor okayed at the time, but told me it increased dopamine. I got a flood of memories and _NAME_ and stuff. Thought I saw a clone in the hospital. Saw people coming and going at whim in the inpatient section. Did not feel safe. Heard people talking about scary stuff but was convinced it was about me. Said 
some strange, delusional, paranoid, provacative stuff back in 2015. In another life, I was so delusional from adderall psychosis and convinced I wasn’t that sick, I tried to join the army while inpatient…Thought I got sick in college or something. Luckily, it didn’t happen in this life. They were pissed off at me for some unknown reasons. Probably stems from 2011 and an alien encounter or something…no clue. In 2015, they had some scary people there. There was contraband and stuff. Some were not good citizens. Some had PTSD like my roommate. I dont like the fact they brought people from the streets and literally picked them up and brought them to the hospital. That hospital CEO was crazy and evil."

That was cool. Then when I got out the receptionest was really friendly too! And the nurse was nice, I made her laugh and I flirted with her a little. She had a good sense of humor. And then I got back on the elavator and there was a really cute woman about 30 years old and she was kind of keeping to herself but we started talking a little and she was friendly and I said something funny and she laughed and I started kinda flirting with her too and I could tell she liked it and she walked away with a big smile on her face.

174333596,"Well, you may recover and get better. But it’s not easy to ignore schizophrenia. And it’s hard to get to a place where it doesn’t affect you at all. Who really knows how it will affect you 2, 5, or 10 years down the road? It may get better it may get worse. I don’t want to be discouraging but the disease can be a lifelong affliction for many. I don’t know about your recovery personally but it’s possible to work while having schizophrenia. You may have to set your sites lower to accommodate the disease, i.e. instead of being the head prosecutor arguing felony charges in court in front of a judge you may have to be the clerk at the desk helping the people file cases in an office. Instead of being the paramedic rushing all over the city at night saving peoples lives you may have to be the security guard opening the gate for the ambulance to get inside to drop people off at the E.R. Goals are great within reason. I hate to be negative but even someone with schizophrenia has to see certain r
ealities. But on the bright side who knows? Hell, anyone looking at me at age 19-21 when I first got sick and I was at my worst would never have imagined I would ever work again or go to school or drive again or live independently. But I did all those things. For years. And at age 59 I’m still doing them. I never had the glamorous jobs but the jobs I’ve had put gas in the car, good food on the table, kept me in nice clothes, paid for my entertainment, allowed me to buy many luxuries over the years, kept me in comfortable warm housing and pay all the miscellaneous expenses that occasionally come up in a persons life i.e. car insurance, registration for my car, replacing a faulty laptop, etc. So yeah, life is a gamble at best but I came from nothing but ended up doing lots of decent, fun things in life. And an important bonus is that I’m personally not a bad guy in everyday life. People give me friendly looks all the time, strangers judge me occasionally and see that I mean well and smile. I don’t hurt 
or bother anyone for the most part and I get to occasionally help people IRL. So yeah, you can accomplish something, we see it all the time on these very boards. I hope your brother was trying to help you and not hurt you but he may be partially correct, It’s no reason to give up or quit though. He may be right but he’s not a doctor or a fortune teller. Life is funny and full of surprises, sometimes great stuff happens to us out of the blue. I wish you good luck."
174333600,"I read those other news stories online and they came up when my mindset was in anger. I didn’t even consider that paraphrasing to be a threat but more of a warning. The co-worker that I threatened didn’t conclude or comprehend what message I was trying to convey to him because he said, “What’s your point?” I rarely get angry and in particular I shouldn’t be getting angry at work because I do not deal with customers. I just lift boxes and tie them up. At that time, I wasn’t even thinking about the schizophrenia forum at all because I was caught in the moment. Your example with the audiologist and secretary doesn’t compare to the details I have left out in this thread. It’s more complicated and involves a vast group of people which I haven’t included."

Then I saw him in the coffin and people shovelling dirt onto him and I just wanted to scream for them to stop. The crunching of the pebbles felt so loud and it felt like my brain was going to explode. We got into the car to head back to the church. I didn’t want to cry but sobs wracked my body. He was gone.

The present method of diagnosis relies upon the patient’s disclosure of symptoms, the symptoms being descriptions of various experiences of consciousness. I think the main reason there is so much _USER_ID_ associated with schizophrenia is because it is described as a “mental” illness instead of being what it is… A brain disease that involves gradual loss of brain cells over time and organic abnormalities such as described in this research. If more people realized that schizophrenia is a brain disease then there would be less _USER_ID_ and greater support for finding a cure."

175921565,"From Medscape: COVID-19 and psychosis: is there a link? Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the research into the SARS-CoV-2 virus has focused on its direct effects on the body with the aim of finding effective treatments and, ultimately, a cure. However, researchers _NAME_, PhD, and _NAME_, MD, are investigating a potential secondary, long-term impact of COVID-19 exposure — greater susceptibility to psychosis. “Over the years there have been data showing an association between exposure to general respiratory viruses such as the flu and subsequent psychotic episodes. This association was especially evident in studies of the aftermath of the great influenza of 1918,” _PERSON_, assistant professor of pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, told Medscape Medical News . Against this background, the investigators conducted a 2011 study to determine “whether or not this association with psychosis was specific to influenza, or if other respiratory infections like t
he coronavirus might also have similar consequences,” said Severance. The researchers examined the response of immunoglobulin G against four human coronavirus strains common at the time. Results showed that more than 90% of adults diagnosed with psychoses had high levels of antibodies to one or more of the viruses, and that all four coronaviruses were more seroprevalent in patients versus controls. Multivariate analyses suggested that two of the coronaviruses — HKU1 and NL63 — may confer particular risk for neuropsychiatric disease. The current study will build on these earlier findings. The researchers plan to examine adult case-control comparisons of the four less severe coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) and quantify the seroprevalence of the more severe forms of the virus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, in patients with psychiatric disorders versus controls"

If it appear so appealing, tempting to respond laugh at yourself for believing it as real and simply not respond to it. Upping the AP dose is not a permanent solution as you can develop tolerance to it and require more and more dose to get same effect also APs can carry several side effects in the long run so better learn to live with it. It only becomes a problem if you start believing in it, responding to it. Consider it like some barking dog, crow sound etc. You can re tune the voice in some mickey mouse voice to make it so unappealing, funny. Can add some circus music to it etc."

175921601,"All three of my stays in psych ward were involuntary. It was better when they let you go outside of the ward for a while so one could go for a walk ,but a coffee and I even went for bike rides in one hospital I was at for some time. The food was really nice and last place I was at they let me crewchette which made it less boring once I was starting to feel better. I really liked the people I think. There were some really nice people in hospital. Some were not nice and some were violent. One girl threw a glass of water on my face because I stole her seat at dinner she said that’s where she sits. One guy and a male nurse got in a fist fight right next to me and another nurse came and pushed me into safety. Once I remember wanting to go to hospital. That was when I stopped taking olanzapine and was getting worse. I felt unable to take care of myself. I could not feed myself and I could not hydrate myself and do normal things like personal care shower. I finally took a sleeping tablet and started tak
ing olanzapine again and immediately (overnight) became better. I wanted to go to hospital because I knew I was getting worse and I felt unable to take care of myself and was having delusions and feeling psychotic. I even had my bag packed ready to take myself in but took medication instead and it helped. In Sweden they had a daycare kind of place where you could go to do pottery and sewing ,woodwork etc and then they had work groups and made things that were sold and I joined a work group that worked at a cafe in a retirement home. It was really good but unfortunately they don’t gave it anymore. The bad thing is there was no invetween for those that were not well enough to be in the work groups there should have been other options where they could come and go for as long as they feel up to . I understand the feeling of needing help with daily living sometimes not coping and then thought of a care home or assisted living . I am happy to be as independent as I am and I have my sacred neigh and myself to care 
for."

I hated some of the experiences and really benefited from others. The best times were when I was really honest and took advantage of the programs and therapy and did some healing and got a good meds change. The worst times were when there were loud, delusional patients running amok and no controls on the ward.

However, there has been little research directly examining cardiac function in schizophrenia.To investigate cardiac structure and function in individuals with schizophrenia using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) after excluding medical and metabolic comorbidity.In total, 80 participants underwent CMR to determine biventricular volumes and function and measures of blood pressure, physical activity and glycated haemoglobin levels. Individuals with schizophrenia ('patients') and controls were matched for age, gender, ethnicity and body surface area.Patients had significantly smaller indexed left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic v

LV concentricity (d = 0.73, P = 0.003) and septal thickness (d = 1.13, P < 0.001) were significantly larger in the patients. Mean concentricity in patients was above the reference range. The findings were largely unchanged after adjusting for smoking and/or exercise levels and were independent of medication dose and duration.Individuals with schizophrenia show evidence of concentric cardiac remodelling compared with healthy controls of a similar age, gender, ethnicity, body surface area and blood pressure, and independent of smoking and activity levels. This could be contributing to the excess cardiovascular mortality observed in schizophrenia. Future studies should investi
gate the contribution of antipsychotic medication to these changes."

175921691,I’m in a bad mood and it has nothing to do with _AT_MENTION_. Apologies to him and the forum.
175921692,"Just because I sound confident doesn’t mean it’s the right thing for me. From what I’ve seen, a lot of people on here feel as if they don’t need their meds. It seems to be part of the illness to think that. I feel better on meds than off them. I just get tempted that’s all"
175921693,Good luck with finding a good med to try. I know what it’s like when you ran out of options. You’ll be in my thoughts and prayers!
175921694,Did you went overweight initially while on meds before working out to keep the weight off?

175921700,"I got tmg supplements about a month ago. I started taking 500mg once in the morning. Sadly, after 3 days I developed a chronic headache. I decided not to take anymore and left it for a few days. Then after a few days I decided (as I was just about to throw the supplement in the bin) that I would try them one more time. Well, I’m glad I did. I took another 500mg and waited to see if I got a headache. Sadly, I did get another headache, but this time it wasn’t so intense. So I thought I’d stick with for a few more days to see if the headache subsided even more…and it did, the headache was much less intense. So I carried on taking the supplement for more days, and to my surprise, the headache was not there. I wondered why this happened. So I researched betaine and found out it detoxes your liver and body. Maybe that’s why I got these horrendous headaches? I also found out beetroot’s detoxify your liver and body. To my surprise, beetroots contain the highest amount of betaine/tmg. I honestly 
wasn’t even searching about betaine in beetroot, it was just coincidence. So I bought beetroot from my grocery and now add them to smoothies and salad sandwiches and burgers. I also take the betaine supplement as well. I don’t over do it though. I like it a lot. When I first took it I feel I was hyper focused to the point of migraine headaches. Now I’m focused more, but without the headache. It’s been nearly a month I think. I’m gonna see how I feel later in the year. So all in all I give it a thumbs up."
175921701,That sounds very pleasant. I’m happy for you.
175921702,"Good time to listen to music and vibe with the meaning of it all. It’s 4:30am I’m listening to Queens of the Stone Age and on this forum. I can see the viscera anger from your words emanating out of the screen, _PERSON_."

I need good friends and excitement etc.. I can't just sit alone all day and be left to my own devices.. I can't find any true meaning. Last spring/summer was good. I stayed up all night some nights. I can't remember where the time went. I'm at a point where my meds and mental health is good - So now life has opened up it's doors and imma walk through.. But I don't know where to go after that. I'm just becoming very grateful and such without even trying to be."

175921710,"well they say it’s good to be humble, but i used to believe that is what led to my self criticism and negative thoughts about myself for some time. it started out as “o just don’t be boastful” but then instead of accepting praise or feeling good about myself i became self critical compulsively now i don’t like self criticism when i see it, but it is common, and in fact i used to be this way. but grew out of it, i guess. now im rarely self critical and just accept my flaws without creating another condition entirely. i feel like im much healthier mentally these last 8 to 10 years, then i was the previous 10 years before that. now what blame do i accept today? i’d rather not think about it."
175921711,"Thanks for the recommendation - I will see if it’s available in the UK, should be! I have tried Zopiclone and Zolpidiem, but they never worked for me either Nozinan is a horrible, old anti-psychotic they give to people for Palliative care. I really cannot stand how it makes me feel. Although I have a good nights sleep on it, when you wake up you feel like you have been hit by a bus! On that I can take 25-50mg, but even cutting a 25mg tab to 12.5mg is still a hard hitter Would have to be incredibly desperate to take that stuff again"
175921712,I’m hoping the drop makes some difference other than the side effects the risperidone is working excellent for me. There’s nothing else good I can switch to that will be covered by my medical aid. I can afford out of pocket but it will be a grudge purchase.work is good and earn decent amount. Other than side effects I live a normal life hopefully lowering will make side effectless
175921713,I wonder if this is worth pursuing at some point since I’m looking to switch APs. Thanks for the link!
175921714,"I have this problem with the way that I think. I’ve tried to describe it to a doctor and a therapist and neither had anything to say about it. My thoughts used to flow freely, quietly, and naturally. Now they are less “thought like” and more like me talking to myself inside my head. For example, in the past I might have seen rain and automatically grabbed an umbrella. Now I see rain and have to say in my head, I need to go get an umbrella. Like all the words in a complete sentence. And that’s how all my thoughts are these days. Me speaking complete sentences in my head. If I try not to do it, it’s like I completely stop processing information until I start talking out loud in my head again. It’s really exhausting. Plus it makes me a really slow and inefficient thinker. Also, it has nothing to do with medication."

175921717,"I understand how you feel but it would be better to engage in this social interaction and desensitize yourself to your fears. You don’t need to disclose the fact that you’re anxious. You’re thinking about it way more than he is. Coming up with things to talk about beforehand is a good strategy, but you don’t need to say anything you don’t want to say. You’re putting the pressure on yourself."

Maybe 1% get back to normal and their cause is drugs like weed (They stop the drug, they get back normal) but many, 15% according to wikipedia, are able to work. 85% are unemployed, which is mostly genetic causes and some are homeless or in mental hospital. I am not able to work, I have a major university degree in physiotherapy and I worked a week in a gym at more than double the minimum wage, I was stressed because I was surrounded by people and I quit. I quit 15 different jobs and I quit forever now. The issue is not scientific intelligence but people and social intelligence. I took 4 Psychology courses in my university after my disease and I got 3 A’s and 1 B. My teacher told me if I wanted to switch my degree to psychology because I was in the top 5 in my classes. I can continue my studies and get a PhD now but for what if I can’t work, interact with people and function in society? I know 2 schizophrenic twins, same genes, one got his PhD in engineering a

175921736,"So I saw my psychologist yesterday and she said in future we might have to switch to video calls or phone calls. Totally get it. My doctor’s appointment on Monday is a phone call. Most people at work are now working at home with laptops. I got an email this morning I have permission to take my whole desktop home. They don’t have enough laptops for everyone so the rest of us take our computers. Haven’t been told to go work at home yet, but it’s coming sooner rather than later. Which makes me think that some of us at least might have permanent working from home status when this is all over. If everything moves to digital and there’s no paper then we would all work from home. Interesting thought. School at home. Work at home. Have no reason to leave the house. At least save money on gas and no commute."

I think once we come to terms with accepting that happiness can’t be permanent, we’re set free from some of the responsibilities of constant drive towards attaining it. Just my thoughts though"
175921795,"Sometimes getting sober is not a matter of “feeling good” or “feeling happy”. Sometimes it’s more like not feeling bad anymore. And if you stay sober there’s a good chance that your general quality of life will improve. Two weeks is commendable. Congratulations. But you’re still in the early stages of sobriety. Don’t expect miracles, give it time; the rewards will come. I couldn’t put a specific time frame on when those rewards will come. For me personally, when I first got clean and sober I became employed and went to college within the first couple months. I left the addict lifestyle behind and only hung around other clean and sober people. I stopped hanging around people who used drugs or drank and stopped going to places where drugs and alcohol were being used. The rewards for me were many and 31 years later I can look back on getting clean as one of the best things I’ve done in life."

Have u considered talking to a therapist? Are u on the right meds... I’m asking bc it took me a while to find the right meds and I’m still not convinced they are doing the trick... bc like you I live w aggravating circumstances... and that does not help a depression.. to the contrary. It does deepen it. I understand you love your dogs.. so do I. I walk twice a day to get out of the house and the pups are happy! And it gives me a lot....they seem to be your babies.

175921819,"I was going to delete this post a few hours ago, I am glad I didn’t because you have said you relate, and I hope you know that I understand, to a degree, your angst. Mental health is becoming “popular”, anxiety, especially, is at risk of becoming either, misunderstood by the listener, or, mistreated by the speaker. Meaning, I’m worried the term will be thrown about more and more, decreasing the importance. So I shared my definition of anxiety, maybe to bring it back to where it belongs, as an awful, drastic, mind-controlling, disease. -not a worry about if wether _NAME_ will be nice to you today or if _NAME_ will ask you to the ??????? dance. sorry."

Everybody, including myself, tried to change his mind but to no avail. So, he died. I’m so mad at the mental health care system that I could scream.

Same thing goes for crying around others. As for a solution that will be something hat mainly you’ll have to play around with, everyone is different. I used to journal a lot. Writer down every single thought, every single emotion. Sometimes I would cry. Sometimes I wouldnt. But a lot of the time I felt lighter than before. Paper holds emotions a lot better than humans. I would do art. Sometimes I didnt know what to draw so I would just scribble I would scribble the whole page and it’s weird but I would feel better. I would listen to songs that I could relate to, songs about things I was going through. It helped me feel less alone and for whatever reason it opened that 
emotional trap and let me cry. Sometimes I would write poems, other times i would come up with random verses to songs that would never get a finished tune. Sometimes i would just curl up under a blanket and just let myself feel. I would try to not shut down. Sometimes it would help to talk to somebody, they wouldnt even really need to say anything. It was good to just have somebody that would listen."

Prior to this slump I was doing well faking it, so much so that I was actually not faking anymore. Just doing well. But then another bout of unexpected nightmares popped up and caused me to think about things for a second too long and it all came crashing down:/ I wish I had more control over my dreams. They often haunt me. Soon enough I think I will feel okay again. For once I actually feel the love from people who have been loving me all along. That helps to keep me here.

If you’re reasonably fit (i.e. you have decent strength and stamina), and your size isn’t preventing you from doing everything you need to do, then I’d say that the weight loss isn’t worth it. Don’t rush this. You’ve got plenty of time left.

Before they diagnosed me I was diagnosed by other psychiatrist with post traumatic stress and psychosis and depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed with Aspergers but she was a clinical psychologist and not a psychiatrist.her colleague that’s a psychiatrist said I’m schizo. I would say I was paranoid but don’t remember having that word in my diagnosis. I’m so happy to be stable but found it really scary to read the question about how long we have been without a fall back to psychosis. Scary stuff to think that one can be stable and then get worse again but I’m on medication and on pension and low stress as such. You guyzzz

175921964,"So all these years I’ve been getting next to nothing for child support when it would not have mattered if I did and I still would have been getting 0 share of cost Medi-Cal and all of a sudden I start getting all this child support, against the court order, which states I’m only supposed to be getting $100 towards arrears, and it’s going to put me over income for the program I’m in (A&D) and it will cause me to get a $1000 dollar share of cost. It’s actually going to cost me money to get this child support. I don’t understand how they can get away with collecting more that what the court order calls for. If they would stick with the court order I would be fine. But no. Now I’m totally screwed. It’s going to leave me about $250 to feed myself a month. I guess I better get used to rice and beans.

Hopefully I can continue to volunteer there.the pregnant lady needs to back off and give me my space and lay off her bad behaviour and etc and hopefully I can stay.otherwise I will have to talk to the manager or quit and I want to volunteer work there.

but thankfully no blood.so happy she is alive and she is retired now. I am getting help with talking to my car insurance .i don’t understand their jargon and feel so upset trying to talk to them because I don’t understand and it feels overwhelming so the other woman who raised me talks to them for me. Also we both agreed about my rent and I’m so happy to get her help and that she agrees with me. I am very dependent on her. Her children and our father hate me. My father has a touch of love for me but he does hate me aswell. My bro n sis want power over me and don’t like me much maybe a touch reluctantly because I’m their step sister sister.they would not help me the way she does because she loves me more than my parents do. And since my bro n sis want power over me that means they can’t help me in a good way. Anyway I’m thankful to be getting help from my stepmom although she is not together with my father anymore. She has enrichened my life in so many ways and helps me so much and I am so depend
ent on her.we started having telepathy when I was around five years old and I think we have a spiritual relationship.she works from around 7 am to 9 at night yet she supports me being on the pension and thinks I should be on the pension and she voted liberal and they are in government now but I voted the greens and then animal justice party.i adore her but I’m not socially brilliant with anyone perhaps.im thankful for her and that’s definitely a positive in my three positives for today.

My primary diagnosis was chronic paranoid schizophrenia. But when I appealed it my doctor said I had schizophrenia, residual type in remission. It definitely wasn’t in remission. Doesn’t mean much really if you ask me but they don’t have all of those subtypes anymore. It’s just schizophrenia."

Mind-body exercise (MBE), aerobic exercise (AE) and resistance training (RT) will be investigated.The Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched from their inception until April 26, 2018. Randomized controlled trials comparing PE with any control group in patients with schizophrenia were included when negative symptoms had been assessed. This _NAME_-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. Moderator, sensitivity, and _NAME_ regression analyses were conducted to explore causes of heterogeneity and impact of 
study quality.We included 22 studies (N?=?1249). The overall methodological quality was poor. The _NAME_-analysis (random effects model) showed a medium significant effect in favor of any PE intervention (_PERSON_ g?=?0.434, 95% CI = 0.196-0.671) versus any control condition. MBE and AE respectively showed a medium significant effect (Hedges' g?=?0.461) and a small significant effect (Hedges' g?=?0.341) versus any control condition. The effect of RT could not be examined. The overall heterogeneity was high (I2 = 76%) and could not be reduced with moderator or sensitivity analyses.This _NAME_-analysis demonstrated that PE could be a promising intervention in the treatment of negative symptoms. However, the quality of the included studies was low and heterogeneity was high, which makes it impossible to make a clear recommendation. Therefore, results should be interpreted with care."

175921977,I have been on and off AP for 8 years. They were prescribed for sleep and anxiety and i didnt manage to get off without getting psychotic. The side effects got worse and are most definitely not worth it. I would not have started if i knew what i was getting into. Should have dealt with the ptsd by therapy. I hate how i just cant be myself anymore. Not on meds. But also not off meds because they made me psychotic and an emotional wreck underneath the AP.

It’s a freaking roller coaster ride. I hooped to make a song “almost Jesus” one day. To make irony that I’m “not Jesus yet” but one day I will be. When of course Jesus would really be born Jesus and wouldn’t have to TRY to be himself. So me living up to another mans stuff I know is unhealthy a lot.

175922072,Yeah before college I didn’t drink or do drugs. All I cared about was like sports and a few other things. Then I started smoking pot at around my 18th birthday. Got arrested 6 months later for my last bowl of shake. Always loved pot the most. But then in community service I got peer pressured into alcohol and other drugs. When I went on probation and couldn’t smoke weed anymore I became an alcoholic. And then had a bad shrooms trip that REALLY made it so I can’t smoke pot. And I drank more and more alcohol and couldn’t quit. But then I take the meds I’m on now and my anxieties and cravings and stuff have gone away for alcohol and hallucinogens lol. Because I really shouldn’t have ever mixed sza with hallucinogens when I knew i had the illness. I’ve realized now. But I’m in a pretty good place. No complaints. Maybe you can try naltrexone or ask your pdoc. It’s really helped me not drink. Gotta go to therapy. Ttyl.

174333738,"Yeah. I wish my pdoc had been more slow about it. He seemed really eager to get me off of Zyprexa. And down on Abilify too. Oh and I also got off of Klonopin in that time, too. It's been a fair amount of time to make all those changes. Probably 3 months or so. But I still think it was way too fast. I think he was trying to test whether I actually had schizoaffective or something. Which to me just sounded like playing with my emotions. I don't know. He always tends towards wanting to reduce meds. I don't like it much. He also got me out of a terrible depression though. I wonder if it's time for a new pdoc. I don't know."

174333763,"I have a friend who has been giving me unsolicited advice. He keeps telling me he had anxiety and he saw counseling for it and now he’s better. I told him schizophrenia and anxiety are not the same thing. I told him you can’t talk your way out of this and that I have this for life. Even after telling him that, he asked if I ever thought about telling my schizophrenia to “go away”. He also tried giving me work and school advice. I told him that a symptom of schizophrenia is lack of motivation, I don’t think he fully grasped what I’m saying. Do any of you deal with people like that in your life? How do you handle them?"

175922225,I’m just going to put my thoughts out there so I don’t let the sad get to me too badly. Feel free to pass this post up. I feel completely indifferent about dying. But I know I don’t want to live anymore. I won’t leave this earth by suicide because I owe it to my loved ones to stay. I guess I’m just having a moment of sadness. I didn’t ask to be born and I don’t want to stay anymore. The older I get the more often terrible things happen. The more I understand that this world is not one I want to be in. People always say that life doesn’t get any easier when you’re older but they leave out the part where it get worse. My problems compound just by me existing. I don’t wanna do it anymore. I just want to opt out of the life I never opted into and call it quits.
175922226,High range tests are usually untimed.

174333768,"This is something outside my experience to speak on. As a person with a below average wang I’ve accepted that, that’s not something I can sell myself on, if you’ve lost an inch, but you’re small I suggest looking therapy about body image and stuff and then another thing that might help is realizing that people exist out there who literally don’t have penises but are sexually attracted to eachother and still have meaningful sexual relationships. What I’m saying is…you should look at lesbians and try to appreciate that they bone, and they ain’t even got a penis. Really internalize that penis isn’t the only part you bring to a relationship. Lesbians wouldn’t exist and wouldn’t be marrying each other if it was all there was to having sex. You’ve lost one inch, you might be pretty small to start off with, but even if you are, that doesn’t mean you need to go so far as to think death is appropriate.

175922235,"I spent six months in a commune in cornwall, uk. It wasnt religous - more of a self-sufficent society. There was no actual vow of silence, but self-reflection was encouraged. I actually came to terms with alot of abuse i encountered by a certain man that used to “take advantage”. I made peace with myself - but unfortunatley over the years that “peace” slowly diminished again. What i did learn tho is, most of the time your problems are exarbated because it actually you thats feeding it and giving it emotional power. Your feeding your own misery. Take the power away from your abusers - and they have no hold over you. Someone once said most Sz’s are actually empaths in a way - people feed off your energy, but you dont realise it at the time. We are the most sensitive of people after all i reckon."

Perpetual dusk, light fading, but never going dark. Magic hour on a fading summer night. The shadow people live there, and tend to the spirits that find the way in. I find it calming, it’s one of the more relaxing planes I’ve found. I remember sitting on the edge, seeing the brink. A nexus had doorways back to other planes, but I didn’t use it, stayed put. It’s funny, the shadows still tend to live in the old ruins they once called homes. Were they like human? Humanoid at the least. Had my wings. Woke up sore too, I’m not used to using them. Phantom pain? Maybe. Got to tell myself it’s not real. That I just have trouble with telling dreams from reality. Psychotic mind flooded with chemicals, and blooming lightning across various neurons. Still feels real…memories still remain…and like always, questions. Tired of always having que
stions. Maybe I just want them to be real, because a lot of times I don’t want what is real, least what they tell me is the real world. I’m ready for more.

175922300,"I think we are operating under different ideas of what self-motivation is. To me, it is the beliefe that you can accomplish a goal combined with taking actions to achieve that goal. To you, it is the ability to not get exhausted and feel defeated. I can guarantee you I feel exhausted and defeated a lot of the time. I have days where it feels impossible to get off the couch. I have days where I think I will never be neurotypical, so thereis no point in trying. I would even say most days I feel this way. But I force myself to do at least one thing every day. Once I’ve taken the first step of starting a task, it is easier to carry on doing tasks. You think that people like me don’t experience negatives. I can tell you, I very much do. I will avoid showering until Mr. Star literally kicks me out of bed because I smell. I will look at the messy house and be parlyized with the inability to clean for hours and days. I will fall into a depressive episode and have incredible difficulty pulling myself of

174333775,"I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1985, and I still have symptoms of the illness. Overall, I think my symptoms have improved, but I attribute that, for the most part, to my environment improving. It’s a long story, but my environment improved greatly in 2012. I also entered into a relationship that year and got a pet (my first pet at age 48). And I started taking care of my mother (who is very sick now (she was living with my sister)). So for the first time in my life I had to care about someone/something other than myself. I still feel uncomfortable going outside of my house (I have this feeling that people are looking/judging me), and I have difficulty taking a shower. I don’t think I’ll ever be comfortable doing certain things, so I have to push myself, no way around it. I’ve become comfortable being uncomfortable; I have to embrace the suck.

175922320,I’m on SSDI. I tried working full time and couldn’t support myself. I had gotten off my benefits but when I couldn’t work full time I got back on them. So maybe you could call and ask Social Security what would happen if you tried working full time but didn’t succeed. Because I was told that Social Security will keep your case on their rolls for awhile so that if you need it again they will automatically reinstate you without having to go through the whole process of starting over from scratch and having to start the process of getting benefits from the very beginning. You could call whatever agency you’re going through and ask about this.

I'm not anxious enough to stop drinking a strong coffee every afternoon. But I'm gonna try and not take one for a week and just deal with the anxiety using coping techniques. I'll only take one for a dissociative panic attack if I ever have one. I don't get normal panic attacks ever (If it's normal adrenaline - I kind of enjoy it) but dissociative panic attacks can last for hours and hours.

175922337,"Someone wrote this already but AA has some pretty good advice. When you feel those cravings and you want to drink, play it through in your mind. Picture the whole process of what’s going to happen if you drink. If you have one beer , it will lead to another. You may feel good for a short while but you will want more and you’ll feel bad afterwards. You will regret it and probably beat yourself up for giving in. You will have the remorse that you gave in. If you are trying to quit for good you will run into temptation occasionally. You have to figure out what will work to successfully fight that temptation. That is what AA is good for. If you join AA you will always have a support system. AA members don’t mind giving out their phone numbers to each other so that you don’t have to fight the urges to drink alone. Help and support is available 24/7."

There are better medications in the works that don’t focus as heavily on dopamine, you can search for their names online. Until they are out we have to be patient.

175922351,"To answer the topic question. I was an innocent kid for the most part. One day at around 6 years old, I went over to a friend’s house. His uncle was watching this action movie. A lot of blood and gore. We were told to go play Super Nintendo in my friend’s room which was the initial plan anyway. Well when I was about to leave I noticed a scene on the television. It was this woman and she had her boobies out. Since then I knew I liked boobies on women. I’ve been sexually attracted to women since then. In my life I’ve been in two relationships that lasted over a year at least. One was for several years. I got lucky because both of those ladies were beautiful. Anyhow, if there is one thing i’d like you to know _AT_MENTION_ it is that it is okay to be gay! I’m not sure where you live and I do know that in many places in the world homosexuality/bisexuality is not only frowned upon but ostracized and even persecuted.

Maybe they see some of the outward signs (though not always). Then there is what they see on the media, which is of course stigmatized. But *most* people don’t understand the inner experiences. Because of a lack of understanding, in some cases people say insensitive things. (An example is telling a person with depression their life is good so they should just be happy). The comments people are making to you about them “being so ocd” are kind of similar, imo, in that they’re insensitive and also show a lack of understanding. I point these things out NOT as an excuse for others, but because I see it as a contributing factor to the problem being discussed."

Now, I don’t even want to leave on good days because of my TD. My husband has to watch me do bad things like cut myself when I’m upset (which I haven’t done in about a year- yay!!!), and he’s just doing the best he can under the circumstances.

175922446,"I believe the lack of thoughts or inability to think clearly or hold multiple thoughts in mind have something to do with sleep quality. Sleep deprivation can causes various side effects both immediately and in long run. Try to improve the sleep, if hard to get good sleep at night try taking some long nap like 1 hr nap before 4 pm. Blunted affect can also be improved with quality sleep. Many medications and supplements can affect sleep for example omega 3, vitamin b12, liones mane mushroom etc try to avoid or reduce to improve sleep quality. Caffeine beverages can affect sleep if take later part of day."

My ex pdoc stated to stay on zyprexa and ""pay efforts ""… she also stated, that I’ll always suffer… but she said, that zyprexa works the best on me and to stop switching aps, cause this wasnt helping me… gosh, I’ve tried 11 aps folks… for ten years we did only this… But I am still low functioning… I am trying currently to regain and energy and fix my thinking in order to suffer less and just have a life… but sometimes, thisdoesnt work yeah… Should we always seek more meds until full recovery? I am still not convinced about that tbh… ok, I am done with the aps but maybe I need an ad too?? But 
what if the ads increase my paranoia as it always was??? The ads also made my somatics worse before… my mom said today that theres no more meds for me… Is it a choice that I made to not seek more meds? What if I cant stand the ads for real? (my mind rushes way too much too for them)… Who here also currently fights with less meds, but gets in pain still? Do you seek for more meds?? Is it right too this in the end?? Yeah…"

175922460,Please be careful on recommending supplements. It’s easy to read on the internet that this or that works or doesn’t. Rarely do such things go through double blind studies. Please provide links or such when recommending supplements so at least we can get a handle on what is going on. It’s important to provide protection for members here and just because you read things on the internet doesn’t make things scientifically viable nor does it make it something that works for all. Medications are hit or miss. Why should supplements be anything but if even that? Please provide current publications or articles.
175922461,I know you expect more from me so sometimes I have to spend time working on it otherwise its just babbling I have got a working system I think. I purchased 2 more local cheap proxies from a completely different site. The same issue when typed into google search it doesn’t recognize it as the correct country and trying to change google search region doesn’t fix the issue either so the only option and it does work with my firefox installation as it is with good speed is to use the PIA firefox extension. That gives you that local ip in browsers while you can be doing something completely different elsewhere with a different ip. In that same browser I am using a common cheap dedicated proxy in a container tab so I can do more private stuff in that and still use google and it will be isolated I have put thought into this as through my battles I have observed the necessity for it this is it I hope you are satisfied with my results.

So I got in and I didn't care that I infected them with influenza B. My watch said that I could possibly die anyways so I took the watch off. It was like being in a real car.

174333819,Hi _AT_MENTION_. My psychiatrist says I have an unusually high level of insight into my schizophrenia. My insight started to develop about 2 or 3 years after I was diagnosed and medicated. Hallucinations and delusions create a patchwork like fused consciousness stream with unsubstantiated unreal segments merged in between real accurately perceived segments. As insight starts to develop you start to recognize which segment of your consciousness stream is real and which is unreal or being played for you like audio or video coming from your mind. Insight builds on itself. The more you come to recognize what is real and not real the more you come to recognize what is real and not real. Best of everything on your journey to wellness.

175922521,"On Tuesday we had to put my pet leopard gecko down. I noticed immediately in the hours after we put him down I was hearing really loud and clear voices unlike how my voices have been for a while now. I heard one say “why did you kill him” and it made me start crying. These voices have continued and I barely got any sleep for the first two days after we put him down so I was hoping maybe that was what was causing the loud voices, but I slept fine last night and today I heard a voice say “why don’t you kill yourself” clearly and loudly. My voices can be mean, but I haven’t heard a voice tell me to kill myself in years. I normally wouldn’t be overly alarmed that I was slipping into a psychotic break over hearing voices that could be caused by stress but I’ve also noticed more paranoid thinking. Today my mom told me she was forgetting things and it popped into my head that it was because of us living in a simulation. I don’t normally ever have thinking related to conspiracy theories l
ike that and it really scared me. Thankfully none of the paranoid thinking has developed into delusions, but I’m scared it will. I’ve never actually had a psychotic break before and I’m scared I’m slowly slipping into one because of the stress of losing my pet. I also keep thinking about my pet’s ghost and him trying to get back at me for killing him. I wouldn’t normally think like that either but I feel like it’s my fault he died because I didn’t take good enough care of him. Does this sound like the beginning of a psychotic break? Like I said I’ve never had one and I’m really scared I’m going to keep getting closer and closer to having a breakdown."

174333831,"Mainly unlike ssri, serotonin drugs no effect on memory, libido, testosterone etc."
175922529,"So here is my story. I am a male, 29, from India. Back in 2009 when I was about to graduate high school, my world turned upside down within a matter of days and it became more & more hellish as days went by. At that time I could not understand what is happening, but today I realize that I started hearing very faint voices, which became unbearable as time went by, had severe delusions, OCD, and anxiety. So, I was really embarrassed about what i had inside my mind. I quietly suffered. Never thought that I am ill. Completed my undergrad anyhow(was a lot of struggle). In 2015, I decided I need to improvise on my career and thus went to the US for Masters. You would not believe me! due to huge changes(good changes) in environment and moving away from people who control my mind, insert thoughts, make me even walk or stand up,etc went away.After 2 semesters, I had poor grades and had to take college transfer. Then in 2017, my Masters was going well. But I had taken some herbal capsules from a store/Amazon 
for my anxiety. I had a severe panic attack. Went to ER. They gave me Ativan! and it made me feel great! So I decided to see a pdoc in Seattle. He wrote me Prozac(diagnosed GAD because i always used to hide actual symptoms because I thought either they are all in at me to control & torture me mentally/they will laugh at me). Prozac gave me severe akathisia. So pdoc told me maybe your diagnosis is wrong. I decided to take break and came to India to see a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia. Then started trials of meds. Some had horrible side effects/ some didnt work. But within 3 months of treatment, Amisulpride + Abilify + Prozac worked for me greatly but I gained about 50 pounds in 2 years/ suffered severe _NAME_ and testesterone was 1/4 of normal and prolactin was pretty high. Now till 2019 I was in USA, very stable. But as soon as I returned back to India due to some reasons, I was fed up with side effects. Doctor then gave me Clozapine 50mg + Amisulpride 800mg. That was the worst decision of 
my life! In 1.5 years I gained about 35 pounds and was sleeping for 15 hours/day and even then couldnt wake up. Now I decided to quit all my meds 4 weeks ago due to all side effects. As soon as I was tapered down slowly from meds by the doctor, I felt anxiety issues. My appetite was down to 1/5 of what I used to eat. Couldnt sleep at all. But I thought I dont need schizo meds. I WAS WRONG. since past 1 week I have been living in HELL. Had the most severe auditory hallucinations and voices and paranoia and delusions. So I decided to go back to the doctor. He promised me to start some good meds. Right now I am on Abilify 15mg/day, I dont have any side effects at all! And my hallucinations are gone but delusions are still 50% existent. Doctor told to go back to Clozapine if Iloperidone/Olanzapine/ Abilify doesnt work. So anyone here help me out with delusions that I have right now, even on Abilify? And is mind control, thought insertion really true? Or is this just a symptom? Which meds worked the best for you? 
And is there any way to control weight gain on Clozapine? Sorry for such a long post:(. Thanks for reading."

175922536,"MV, Hey, that is great news! Beats taking a sleep aid and not being able to function the next morning! Thanks for the report...and glad to hear it is working for you! S.C."
175922537,My mom is incredibly annoying when she's drunk. My cat went under my bed and started scratching to get out and makes the most annoying noise and wouldn't come out - So I just sat there and let my blood pressure RISE and RISE. I took a 0.25mg clonazepam and feel a bit better. My sleep schedule is messed up now.
175922538,"I took a glass bottle and smashed in on the ground, and (TW) harmed myself and shouted weird phrases. Also I started to punch myself and bang myself on the walls while screaming in the psych holding room thing. The doctors had to come and tell me to stop. I woke up from a coma (or a deep sleep) after my overdose and I started scratching my arms with my teeth, and then a nurse came and restrained me. I was really psychotic when I was tied up. They didn’t even let me go to the bathroom and made me pee in a small basket while being tied up. That was so demoralizing."
175922539,Well I had to stop going to school at the start of February so since then it’s been the same every day and if I didn’t have my phone I would probably just sit at a window and watch the world go by.
175922540,I really don’t know about that. If required I could see the psychiatrist though. I’m on Social Security Disability and Medicare now.
175922541,"its completely unwarranted he reacted that way: suicidal thoughts are dangerous and stressful! trauma, even if it isnt in the present, can always have lasting, damaging effects. i hope that your pdoc provides you more support! be safe and well, you deserve it c:"

175922544,I think meds dont always completely rid of symptoms but help to alleviate the issue as much as possible to be able to function as best as possible…
175922545,"It was in 2015, I was unmedicted. Now no issues on meds other than severe negative and mild cognitive symptoms."
175922546,The past traumatic event reason for this dream. You like to have sex but not want to give oral due to the past traumatic event. In that past event you did only oral so that event influences you to think that men only want oral and not like to have sex with you. You not suitable for sex etc. Anyway its just a bad dream just like bad hallucination which occurred in a dream.
175922547,yea i got cut back on stimulants it causing alot of side effects that i dont need to feel. I want to feel good inside.
175922548,my meds has a calming effect. but i still have to ”tell myself” to be normal everyday.
175922549,But if I don’t talk about my so-called delusions I think it will say I’m fine.
175922550,"I kinda dont feel good. I wonder if I may be getting a cold. My boss was sick past 2 days and ugh, I'm probably gonna get it."
174333827,Medical News Today Schizophrenia: Restoring brain circuitry to improve symptoms Researchers finally zero in on the brain network that drives the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia and suggest a noninvasive treatment.
174333818,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Childhood infections and schizophrenia: the impact of parental SES and mental illness, and childhood adversities. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Brain, behavior, and immunity , Jun 24 2019 Childhood infection has been proposed as an important etiologic factor for schizophrenia. However, it is unclear to what extent the association between childhood infection and schizophrenia is confounded by parental socioeconomic status and mental illness, and childhood adversity, and whether the association is explained by familial liability for infections. We used a historical, population-based cohort design, selecting all singletons born in Denmark between 1981 and 1998 (n = 882,813). We identified exposure to infection as having been hospitalized with an infection in the Danish national registers. Data from a range of population-based registers were used to construct a childhood adversity index. The index included the following adversities: family disruption, p
arental incarceration, parental chronic somatic disease, death of a parent, parent permanently outside of workforce, childhood abuse and placement in out-of-home care. We also assessed parental socioeconomic status and mental illness. Multiple admissions with infections during childhood increased the risk of schizophrenia with an Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.19-1.38) for 1 infection to an IRR of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.30-1.58) for 2-3 infections and an IRR of 1.95 (95% CI: 1.66-2.29) for ?4 infections. Parental socioeconomic status and mental illness, and childhood adversities increased the odds of acquiring childhood infections and was associated with schizophrenia, but did not explain the results. Similarly did familial liability for infection increase the risk of schizophrenia, but did not explain the association between infection and schizophrenia. Parental mental health modified the association between childhood infection and schizophrenia (p-value 0.02), and we found no significant effect of c
hildhood infection in those with propensity for psychotic disorders."

174333823,"_PERSON_ Zyprexa makes you gain weight fast, I was on it for a couple of months. It also made me sleepy during the day. My psychiatrist and in my experience the best with least side effects is Abilify but I developed side effects like gambling, compulsive shopping and hypersexuality. If you don’t get these side effects then Abilify is your best med. I am currently on Latuda."
175922557,Maybe when we die we find out some more answers though. Or maybe we just die. Who knows. I know I don’t have the answers yet but sometimes I consider this possibility. Life just has so many coincidences or I just notice them more. I believe there’s like divine meaning in the world but it’s crazy. Some things I don’t think “god” is capable of. Only man that made himself god by creating a simulation
175922558,Congrats on getting your work done for the day! Reward yourself with some enjoyable leisure time! And then back to work tomorrow!
175922559,Commission would be they give me something to draw and then they buy it off me? Or is commission just people asking for the art and I give them a price?
175922560,I get the best results from a combination of the two.

175922576,I’m only sneaky when I’m stealing food off of other people’s plates! Lol
175922577,"Hello all, was hoping to get some advice. I will try to make a long story short. I started lexapro at 15 mg about three years ago. Had worked pretty well until a about 4 months ago, when I started to get some anxiety and irritability, and mood swings. Basically the way I started 3 years ago before major anxiety and depression settled in. I tried CBD oil, to supplement the lexapro, and it worked well for a couple of days, and then seemed to make everything worse. I tried ashwagandha for about 3 weeks now and that seemed to help in the beginning, but now I seem to be very shaky and irritable. Went to my doc, and she wanted me to go to 20 on the lexapro. Did that for 2 days, 1st day was good, second day, I was shaky and anxious. I wonder is the ashwagandha has anything to do with that. So my plan is to eliminate the ashwagandha, have already eliminated the CBD. Do 15 mg of lexapro again until everything else is out of my system. Basically start over. Then my plan is to go to 17.5 lexapro for a week or 
two and then possibly 20. My questions are, has anyone tried CBD or ashwagandha with their ssri? Does it sound like I'm doing the logical thing? Fortunately I have some klonopin, but don't like taking it everyday. Is it possible Lexapro will not work for me, even with an increased dose? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks."
175922578,"Maybe I’ve been in hell for sins in a past life. And, I have visions that I’m stuck in a hell forever, not in my right mind."
175922579,If that’s directed at me- I’m on Invega trevicta.
174333828,"In the beginning my negatives were excruciating and severe. Now, they are manageable with Vraylar. I tried different meds that were hell and did not work for 7 years or so. I also used supplements that may have improved my negatives temporarily like Sarcosine and Sodium Benzoate. I stopped all supplements due to the dangers and cost. It’s also a hassle and nobody knows if they interfere with the meds and it just complicates the situation even further."
175922580,"And guys, sorry to dwell always on the same thing, but I am just alone here. I think it became a symptom to dwell, cause my thinking is bad yeap. I am just afraid, that the efforts wont be enough, but my pdoc said I am a heavy case and they tried on me 11 aps with no help, so they say to pay efforts now… with the Zyprexa in order to not be really, really ill…"
174333835,My pdoc thinks I have borderline personality along with my schizoaffective disorder. I heard borderline personality disorder can cause brief stress related psychosis but only transient. If psychosis not only in times of stress but at normal times and symptoms longer then it’s most likely not personality disorder but schizoaffective or schizophrenia. But check with your pdoc
175922581,I used to buy packs of wafers like that they were 50c a piece
175922582,Yes to both 151515
175922583,"You say it is Captain _USER_ID_’s tache but perhaps others have seen a similar phenomenon too. I can’t see it but I think that _NAME_ is looking at the same thing when he pouts in for instance, the “Get it On (Bang a Gong)” video. The Iranian symbol, the Faravahar is said to depict wings but I think that it might be a moustache, especially because the little guy in it has a moustache and is holding a circle. The ancient Chinese Taotie, and the Japanese Shishi and Koma Dogs have nothing or little in the way of bottom jaw, again emphasising top lip."
175922584,Grandiosity? 15
175922585,"Ha! Unique idea, _AT_MENTION_. You’re right, those shows are ludicrous and really do make it seem like a real haunting is impossible. What passes for “evidence” in those shows is laughable."
175922586,I'm from that section of the country and was just curious. Are you taking any medicine for that?
175922587,"Thanks for sharing! I worry how it’ll be as I get older too, past I wasn’t sure. I’m angry with my dad, I feel (right now) that he ruined my high school…it may pass as I get more well. Even today. I’m currently worried my siblings might surpass me too far, I’m 23, but I might just end up being that angry uncle who’s jealous. I’ve never treated those uncles great. I feel that when I’m great w/ inhibiting myself, I don’t manifest my narcissism, which I believe to be genetic. That’s my dad’s thing, my mom is ocd, both of them are really backward…I never made it out… I would like to though. My sister can help me assess what I should do soon, but she’s busy, so I need help to get out and get started."
175922588,"That’s not the first case of death, my teacher said that there was cases of coma and death back in 2014. It can use ketones but that’s no where near the efficiency and stability of glucose. I think long term keto makes you tired. Really the best way to lose weight is low fat low-moderate carbs high protein diets coupled with lots of physical exercise."
175922590,so its easier when off medication
175922591,I feel sorry and i have not been doing horrible things for last 2 years. But still i go through toughest time of my life. No one respects me anymore. Even my wife does not respect me. I lost my character. I guess i am done with my life.
175922592,i wrote this over a year ago before i was even posting or going on this site.
175922593,"Glad you’re moving forward with your life, I wish you luck going forward"
175922594,I’ve never been to mental hospital. When i started hearing voices i called myself my pdoc even though i didn’t think i was ill. I knew that he was a person who could tell me what happened to me.
175922595,"My only concern about my manners is that I say ma’am and sir. Nowadays, that might offend someone because they may identify as a different gender. I don’t want to hurt anyone by doing that. I think I am a very polite, well-mannered person, though. It is one of my rare good qualities."
175922596,"I was in panic, though. Normally I don’t take them. what do you take for panics?"
175922597,I drink coffee and te quite a bit but I avoid soda and energy drinks. Once drank a bunch of soda became extremely manic. I take my pills and I push myself to do chores
175922598,"it could be akathisia, my worst enemy. sounds like it is. ask your pdoc if your meds can cause it. also ask for ativan, it’s the only way I can treat akathisia although if you don’t catch it early it can be a long wait for it to kick in."
175922599,"I was offered psychotherapy but i was at a peak of my depression and i barely could talk, so i rejected it…"
175922600,"I spent too much money and have a $5 a day food budget. I took back bottles and got eggs, bread, Orange juice, oatmeal, brown sugar, milk and grated cheese for my popcorn. I don’t think I made eggs and toast in years."
175922601,Managed to do pump. Got Botox between my eye brows but that’s the only thing I can afford. I can’t afford fillers and thread lift etc but something is something and appreciate that something. Said g’day to people at salvos and got a painting and my dog walked a whole lap around the block which he hadn’t done in months because he refuses.
175922602,What I’m experiencing seems so real. Idk why it couldn’t be real.
174333854,It probably means we respond better to medication
175922603,Well I couldn’t wait longer than 16m so I have just had a go about this as I am super pissed off about this for some reason this morning
175922604,"Oh that’s so good! That must help that depression, too! You’re a fighter! How often do you help there?"
175922605,I had Haloperidol tablet 3mg prn it was good stuff really chilled me out but I would ask for double sometimes and it got to the point where it locked my tongue up so I had to remove it from prn
175922606,Can’t you integrate advertising in your channel?
175922607,Not sure where I was going with post Sometimes I have paranoia and describe it like it actually happened. I guess I had paranoia the Dr didn’t like me that’s why they put me on the wrong medication and diagnosis Which I know to be silly and stretching but it’s I dunno noones perfect I guess wonder why they didn’t see the real diagnosis begin with . But it’s not my job and it’s not easy job that’s why they make good money?

175922613,"SP, you're past few picture posts have really moved me!"
175922614,Yes. Unless someone has access to your computer or account it’s private.
175922615,Pretty sure I had OCD off meds.
175922616,I know I spill a lot. I forget to be careful. So the provider had to do a whole load of dishes about it because she’s afraid somebody will get the flue if I just wipe them off.
175922617,I’m sorry to hear
175922618,"You should ignore those voices and try to find meds that help you get rid of them. I don’t know you, but you are probably not a bad person. Smoking cigarettes? 1 billion people does that, and you are not bothering anyone except for maybe second hand smoke. Youre voices have absolutely no foundation what so ever."

175922656,Medications work over placebo and mental health costs a lot of money. Psychoanalysis wasn’t too effective in dealing with mental disorders as they have a structural/genetic base. Treatment with medications is the most proven course. Yeah. We could always use better medications and better treatments but at our current technology meds are it.

Most of us here have been through psychosis and come out the other side. You seem to always be asking people to justify or confirm your delusions. It always bothered me when I was unwell why no one acted on my stuff. ASIO were after me then helping me and everyone should have known. I couldn’t figure out why the doctors weren’t concerned…Then later I could see why… It doesn’t really matter what your psychosis is telling you. Pretty much it’s all the same because it’s not real and it’s delusional. It matters to you but it’s not something feasible to anyone else. They don’t have thought insertion or telepathy. They can’t find a cure for sz yet they can talk to other people with their minds? No. It’s still science fiction and whatever website is telling you this is current you should avoid. It’s just abs
olute rubbish. I know it’s hard. But take your meds and if your still struggling with this tell your doc and take another med or increase your current with their supervision. Your lost chasing shadows and it isn’t healthy for anyone. You very much sound like you’ve plain old paranoid schizophrenia. I know. I’ve been there.

175922676,"The anxious/excited combo is such a confusing feeling! It’s so good and bad together. Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplane
s or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like you’re just daydreaming to observers."
175922677,? have hernia too. Then just buy some books.
175922678,"I got my Aspie DX after the SZ DX, and it was too late for it to be useful to me. The time when I needed accommodations was in grade school and that’s well in my rear-view mirror now. Yes, there are social impairments, but being an Aspie also gives me a singular focus on tasks that neurotypicals lack, which means I can pile through things that bore them and cause them to lose their concentration. Overall it’s a win for me now. I need ongoing treatment for my SZ, heart, and diabetes, but being an Aspie isn’t an issue for me any longer."
175922679,"I can’t feel nicotine anymore, not even 50mg/mL Nic Salt no matter how long I vape. Did I fry my nicotine receptors from too much nicotine? 50mg/mL is the maximum in the market and doesn’t hit me at all."

It also isn’t universal, This antioxidant protection is reportedly aberrant in schizophrenia, with some patients having a notable reduction of GSH in the brain [4,5,6] and others with relatively better outcomes having higher than expected levels [7]."
174333852,"I keep reading both at this forum and elsewhere about the experiences of people with sz and I just don’t qualify. My so-called negative symptoms could be down to depression and the meds. My positive ones are puny compared to what others seem to have. And yet several doctors have already endorsed the original diagnosis. My pdoc has referred me to a psychologist for additional therapy. I think I’ll try to convince her that I’m not sz, and take it from there."

175922720,"A good start would be not eating junk food or sugar. And a good start with that would be not bringing any into your house. Read labels when you shop, there’s sugar in many things that you would never guess; ketch-up for example, or beans. Try to avoid those frozen dinners or entrees you see in the frozen food section. Most of them have too much salt and preservatives and other nasty ingredients that aren’t good for you. Eating fresh food is usually preferable to eating frozen food. Fresh vegetables and fruit have all kinds of great healthy nutrients in them and are essential to any diet. Fresh meat isn’t bad for you in moderation. Avoiding red meat is usually a good idea though but having chicken a couple nights a week is OK. And seafood is healthy, stuff like salmon and cod or whitefish have a lot of protein and low fat and are highly recommended in most diets. Dairy is OK if you buy non-fat or fat-free. Fat-free milk, fat-free cottage cheese, fat-free cream cheese, fat-free sour cream, all 
in moderation are OK on most diets. Don’t eat foods with lots of fat in them. Again: read labels! Something like refried beans may sound healthy but they’re loaded with fat. Avoid sugary cereals, usually they have no nutritional value but tons of sugar. Just avoiding too many carbohydrates is a good rule of thumb. Reasonable size servings of pasta is not terrible but try to stick to whole grain, it’s healthier than regular. Pay attention to how much and when you eat every day. You may be snacking or grazing a lot more than is good for you. A snack or two between meals is OK but don’t overdo it and don’t snack on unhealthy stuff like chips, cookies, candy etc. Try to eat a piece of fruit or some yogurt or some unsalted popcorn. None of this is extremely hard to do, it’s mostly common sense, and just getting into the habit of watching what you eat."

Then my parents started to say, “You are only interested in your friends and in Catholicism, but you’re not interested in everything around you. You need to have broader interests.” Is it possible to be interested in everything? I don’t know if this is possible and I’m sitting here feeling hurt.

174333872,"It has occurred to me that at this present moment in time and as the title would suggest, being the best description of what I am experiencing right now. I know through my experience of participating within hearing voices support groups and of my involvement within a few volunteering roles that there are many who would resonate with this description (even though a bit _NAME_) I have attempted to break down all the consistent parts of analyzing the condition of Schizophrenia by way of personnel experiencing of living alongside its many potholes and of the public spectacles displayed to a few of us, by way of street theatre, group gaslighting attempts, the reality of 'voices' in our sub-conscience or mind being like a malicious tormenting broadcast, dead set upon screwing us up, and the laughter of the 'voices' as they take pleasure within their assaults. I have even compared this experience to other more tangible things like revenge for hire, molka, cyber hazing, frapping, and workplace mobbing. As 
they all share the very simple characteristic aspect of torturing a singled out victim for the consumption of the baying mob. I have even spoken to a few private investigators with knowledge of electronic harassment and they explain the general dynamics of GSM or BAN systems, coupled with very real acts perpetrated by very real hateful, sly people, so with all this knowledge and observing the slow tidal turn around within mental health industry towards detrimental medications, welfare cuts and talk therapy, along with the growing TI movement out of the ashes of youtube groomer agent provocateurs, is still there as some of us redefine our life experience and 'voice' hearing experiences. Websites like RecoveryintheBin, Mad in the UK, Freedom for Targeted Individuals, and AskaPatient.com have contributed towards this newly emerging landscape of new views and service user shared experiences. I take some inspiration from _NAME_ plight and brick wall like stand against hidden abuses with the local communities where 
by voices were never acknowledged. It would be great to hear some view's with regards to how you feel about genuine targeting, organized harassment acts like baker acting, gaslighting, and the age of digital Zersetzung."

I’m not sure what’s going on yet, but it has me concerned. I was at the ER and followed up with my PCP before the sleep hallucinations started. Once I got those I went for a mental health assessment. I was just given information on where to find help elsewhere. I’m thinking I may need to go get checked again somewhere else."

174333874,This is just a heated beanie for wearing outside in cold weather to keep your head warm. It has nothing to do with treating schizophrenia symptoms.
175922786,That sounds like a bad decision on your doctor’s part. Idk what I would do.
175922787,Nagging: My definition: The constant repetition of unpalatable truths.
174333877,"For the record (regarding the previous post), I do not believe that I am a god. These are just some strange interactions I’ve had with people since I’ve had this schizophrenia. About me being delusional, neither do I believe that I’m going to be tortured after death - I simply can’t, because my schizophrenia controls my belief now, and I cannot have paranoia since I don’t have any thoughts. What I wrote about the torture is me simply relaying what the voice or/and the fake thoughts are saying. And whether you consider the likelihood of me being spiritually possessed (or in other words my “schizophrenia” being a spiritual condition, rather than a brain based) to be impossible or not depends on your belief system; I understand it is not in theory impossible because the possibility has not been scientifically disproven (nobody has done a brain scan on me, and the medications I’ve received so far have not had any effects or side effects whatsoever). I don’t believe an exorcism could h
elp me, and the “spirit” (or “me”) already tried to join the congregation of a local church, but that may be impossible, because the requirement is that I should want it - I can’t want anything apparently, since it seems I lack free will. Or in other words, if my body would go and get me baptized, that decision may be made either by me (if it’s me, it would have to be an “invisible” decision, not a conscious one), or by the process that makes my body behave in unreasonable ways: I cannot know which would make that decision - me, or the process. A fake thought just told me they won’t let me make that decision, so according to “them” the decision will be made by the mentioned process, and therefore I won’t be baptized. I do know it would be pointless to do it regardless, because I’m missing my entire inner world (including thoughts, ideas, beliefs, will, emotions, etc), which is essential for any spiritual or religious ambition. There is only the fakeness (fake thoughts, concepts and f
eelings) produced by my schizophrenia, and there is nothing to do with that. There is one more thing I remember, related to this “process”: I had a dream. I was playing a computer game in that dream, and I liked it - it was as if in the old times. That indicates that my “anhedonia” is also under the control of that same process that controls the voices , which is being maintained by my “schizophrenia”. For what purpose is my schizophrenia keeping me from enjoying the life, and making it unpleasant by applying foreign feelings - I have no idea."

174333900,"Psychiatric medications can really make a huge difference in the lives of those dealing with mental illness in a good way. Some people can't survive and function without them. But they all have their trade-offs. One common side effect of many psych meds is that they can cause your hands to tremor and shake when you get nervous. I used to be on pills that made my hands shake unusually bad when I was anxious. However, now I'm on a pill that makes my hands shake sometimes, but not as much. But I still don't like my hands to shake because then everyone can tell that I'm nervous. With the Clozaril I'm currently on, sometimes when I get nervous my hands shake, while other times when I get nervous my hands don't shake...and I don't know why. Fortunately, if you get on medication(s) that cause your hands to tremor like mine sometimes do, they do have medication that can help stop that problem. Also, taking Vitamin E may help. So if you have shaky hands due to psychiatric meds, talk to your doctor for more 
information to see what you can do about it."

It just means your sick of your current physical/emotional situation - and you want to change it. Its your brains not so subtle way of telling you its had enough. Think about the coping mechanisms that you have learnt.

I too have had similar thoughts about neighbours, making the mistake to interpit that every noise I heard from others had something to do with me. I attribute this to having a racy mind and spending too much time in my apartment, contracting cabin fever. People have their own lifes to live, it would make as little sense for them to put me in the focus of their attention as it would for me to care about what they were doing.

They’ll say my insecurities, but not my truths. And it will hit home. And I will say “they said that because they knew it would effect me so they’re intuitive but in a spiteful/harmful way” I’m not sure if people are not perceptive or intuitive. But psychic??? They are most definitely NOT that. But I think they have more “psychic ability” than I used to think. That said they do not fit the bill of “psychic”. No one does.

I’m terrified of sickness and this f***ing coronavirus crap around is freaking me out. Is there any hope out there that it will stop??? I’m scared of driving and going to do repeated driving lessons and tests scares me. I procrastinate with everything. My motivation to do things is nil (except for reading books which is an escape for me). I think of suicide longingly. There doesn’t seem to be any way out of this life except that.

174333929,"Is it normal to not be on meds for like 7 months, and not feel any different? I’m starting to wonder if I even have this illness. Ironically, the only thing that has helped me was taking an Antibiotic(that crosses the BBB) when I have insane amounts of fear, and different sense of what’s going on. Ironically, my symptoms(Positive) get extremely worse, then I feel literally sick(physical symptoms), throw up(I think)within like 10 minutes, and have to immediately take a Zypreza, which obviously has never helped(nor as any AP). I did feel somewhat better in the morning. My Chronic physical illness got some better. My positive symptoms were less, as well as my OCD(which happened as soon as I got my current physical illness).The Positive symptoms started a week after I had a minor podiatric operation. I think it all correlates but, usually I only had like one pill(I took the rest during off times, but to no avail). Honestly, looking at all of this, I think it is Toxoplasmosis. This can cause of said 
symptoms."

I’m also going to be asking for help with my living situation, because my mom is seriously stressing me out being a bîtch to me all of the time. Hopefully, we can work something out, like maybe finding a place that’s close to a college or something so that I can work towards my degree. I’m starting to feel the need to assert myself and begin gaining my independence. I want my own money, my own transportation, my own space. I asked my mom when I was getting my ID because I wanted to get a job, but she said that I wasn’t ready to work because of my mood and cognitive symptoms. Then I asked if I could start having an allowance for doing chores, and the bîtch said no. Like, really? She’s always talking about how I need to be more independent and adul

I want to start playing clarinet again. I have no issues living with my mom, really. I don’t even take issue with her helping me manage my money. What I do have an issue with is being treated like I’m still 14 and newly psychotic, like I’m nothing more than a glorified punching bag. I am a human being, and I deserve to be treated as such.

In particular, individuals with schizophrenia are subject to _USER_ID_ and have greater clinical (e.g., positive symptoms, negative symptoms, etc.) challenges. In addition, on average, individuals with schizophrenia experience greater socio-environmental (e.g., poverty, low rates of employment, low rates of marriage) difficulties , and are objectively less integrated within their communities although their perceived sense of belonging within the community may not differ from individuals without schizophrenia living in the same community. Recent surveys indicate that self-reported annual rates of loneliness among individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (76 to 80%) are approximately 2.3 times higher than those in the general population (35%) .Highlighting its clinical importance, loneliness has been repor

I was doing something positive. Best trick I ever found was 15 minutes intervals. When I get a craving I will do something stimulating for 15 minutes. That’s often enough time for the craving to pass. Or at least get my mind off of it. Figuring out why you use is also a boon.

175923075,"sweetheart... I am so sorry to read this... I know you cannot just pick yourself up and be bright if your body and mind do not allow it. I know the struggle but seem to be much older than you, so might know my body a bit better... first, let me tell you that it is real what you feel, and also, you should not feel ashamed of what you are going thru. Many people do and it is a real affliction! Its not something you can just not manage because you are ""weak', it is real! You might need to talk to your doctor and see if you are on the right medication.. So now, to me, I am 54 have two teenage daughters, and have been thru two bouts of depression, first after the birth of my second daughter 15 y ago and recently because of marital issues. It has been the hardest I have ever experienced. But you need to be persistent and just continue what you are doing with therapy (I do that too - you can continue via video, especially if you have known your therapist previously, I promise, it takes very little to adj
ust to the platform), and then see a psychiatrist. I was put on Zoloft initially but after 6 months I was still not myself... so they suggested a gene test GENESIGHT - and it determined what I would tolerate best, now I am on a drug that does both serotonin and norepinephrine, which seems to help a lot more. It is a long struggle. But I promise you you do not have to suffer. Also, have a close friend you can open up to - and DO talk to your parents. Tell them how you feel, physically, and how that affects you, and the symptoms you have. Please, promise me. There is help. And talk to your mom. We love our children, we want them to be ok and live to their fullest. If you cannot talk to her, please take an appointment with your GP and have him refer you to a psychiatrist or a psychiatric nurse. They will help you. I promise. You need to stand up for yourself. Not sure how old you are, but I know you do not have to suffer thru this alone. Write any time. I am here - and I have been thru hell and back."

175923083,"The first time I remember feeling brave about my disorder is when I came out of the bipolar closet online. Very few people knew what I talked about when I said I was “sick” on an old personal blog. I titled the post “Be Brave, ElainaJ,” and out it came – hospitalizations, medications, loss of friends, therapy. It was there, in all the stuff I felt ashamed or embarrassed of. And how can I be embarrassed by a chronic illness? _USER_ID_. No one will talk about it. But let’s go back, way back, like so far back I am just about to get sick. The day (or night. I don’t know) I woke up in ICU I was brave. Those days meeting new psychiatrists and workers and patients in the ward, I was brave. Having to move back to Oklahoma and not care what people thought about me losing (resigning) my job in California was brave. Waking up every morning during one of the worst depressions I ever had after that move, was brave as hell. The bravest thing I know how to do is to live when all I want to do is die. 
Bravery is not the same as confidence. Confidence comes along with pride. Bravery comes from fear. The next brave thing I did was write book. There Comes a Light: A Memoir of Mental Illness was/is just that. The story of my struggle up until I finished writing coupled with my few mental illness. I wanted to write it so that someone, somewhere, would not feel so alone. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/06/18/my-brave-disorder/"

They acted like they knew how to take better care of my diabetes than I did, and as a result, my blood sugar was all over the place!! I’m terrified of going back specifically because I don’t want them to ruin my blood sugars and cause damage to my body.

But they never gave a diagnosis other than, I dont have any neurological disorder! They said I have functional symptoms due to past traumas! They all seemed to think I have a psychiatric problem. Then I was diagnosed with somataform disorder. It’s all so frustrating and confusing. I saw several neurologists albeit they are all known to each other here in Ireland, so they were all aware of my case. They all agreed I do not have a neurological disorder. Some days I think I do because of my symptoms. I’m hoping my meds will work. My head is so woozy today, and I get sleepy a lot. It’s my head that’s the worst, all foggy and woozy. I’m not sure what’s going on with me. Its probably right my diagnosis, somataform disorder.

175923110,"Hello, I have always had difficulties with my sleep. Sometime I felt like I could not let go of a particular thought and it would keep me up late into the night until i finally let it go and could get some rest. The more I tried to get it out, the longer I would be up. It would be something irrelevant, like going over an exam I had taken earlier in the day, over and over. I also have this problem that I don't sleep straight through the entire night. I usually get one solid chunk or sleep, followed by tossing around, in and out of sleep. I was always very sensitive to any noises I heard during this period of time, if i started to hear birds chirp, there would be no chance of me going back to sleep, because my mind would concentrate on the noise. I would concentrate on any minor sound.... I recently moved into a college dorm room, and I live directly above a work facility (terrible location for a dorm). There is this high pitched beeping noise that starts exactly around the time my sleep breaks ~4am. 
It is an intermittent, really loud echoing beep, every 10 minutes, that lasts for about a minute. For a while it would just wake me up and I would be tired throughout the day. After about a week, I started to get sleep anxiety before bed, I already worried about this sound waking me up, I anticipated it, and even if i hadn't started yet, i could no longer fall asleep. I don't really know where the sound is even coming from, I would look around, but it is echoing and hard to pin point. Over the last 10 days, I have been hearing this noise even when I go home and sleep in my own bed. I went home for 5 nights, and only on the 4th and 5th night did the noise seem to dissipate a little. But then I had to go back to school, and everything started up again. Now i feel my like my mind is constantly searching for this sound, it is unable to just function normally, kind of like i have been hypnotized. I have experienced great anxiety over this, and panic attacks at night, thinking about if I am going crazy. I created e
ven more anxiety by using google, and thinking I might have tinnitus for the rest of my life. Since then, I don't really hear beeping anymore when i go to bed, so I dont think i have tinnitus, lol. But now I feel like this thought of ""do i hear this beeping sound?"" is stuck in my mind, causing me to be hypersensitive with sounds and constantly check my ears to see if i hear a beeping noise. My concentration in school has been affected. Thankfully, I am probably going to change rooms and get away from this sound soon - within a week. Hoping A change in environment will help me forget. However, I am almost always alone, causing me to keep this though in my head, and i have also have dealt with depression for a long time (since my UC diagnosis). Sometimes I am depressed enough, to where I have bad thoughts. I don't really have the money to receive cognitive behavior therapy or anything like that, but would I benefit from any medication, like an SSRI or something? Anything I can do to help me stop obsessing and 
turn off this super sense of hearing. Thank you, _NAME_"

175923112,"It’s not! The “chemical imbalance” story is just a (bad) metaphor for why certain psychoactive substances work (sometimes!) as treatments for psychiatric disorders. The discovery of the effectiveness of the drugs happened through serendipity. Certain drugs happened to work, and then researchers came up with the imbalance story as a post hoc explanation. Nowadays most neuroscientists and psychologists recognize that the chemical imbalance metaphor is pretty much useless as an insight into what is going on in the brain. There is no way to measure chemical balance in the brain, and the concept may even be meaningless when applied to the brain as a whole. Levels of neurotransmitters vary depending on the specific brain area, the specific behavior of the person or animal, and also the time of day and other contextual factors. Moreover, even speaking of a level in the first place is misleading: the level is different depending on the timescale at which you look at the system. Attributing problems i
n the brain to chemical imbalances is like attributing problems in the world to imbalances in temperature, rainfall, or wind. The idea is too vague to be of any use. These kinds of factors vary quite a bit even within a single town or city. In fact the word neuroscientists used to convey this variability is borrowed from climate science: microenvironment . Just as nearby neighborhoods in a city can have different weather patterns, adjacent brain areas can have different neurotransmitter patterns."

175923208,I managed to lose almost 20 pounds since Christmas. Changed my diet and walked a couple hundred kilometers and also weightlifter last 4 weeks too. I did a bunch of 7-10km+ walks some were speed walks. I was powered by mania lol
175923209,I subscribed 666/999
175923210,I did that. Mother kept thinking I wanted to pee.
175923211,I took the prescribed & a vitamin C.
174333999,"At first I puzzled over this, thinking I must be really special or something, but then as I got a more firm grasp of the underlying objective reasons it seems like this is the case: A schizophrenic’s brain is chronically stressed. The reason for this is a weak / faulty blood-brain barrier allowing for the intake of reactive oxygen species, that causes oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in parts of the brain. That inflammation provokes the secretion of adrenaline by the adrenals, to provoke your “fight-or-flight” reflex, to get you out of danger (but the danger is everpresent, owing to a chronic brain injury.) That adrenaline then pools in the brain and oxidizes, forming adrenochrome, which is the same compound that causes LSD to be a psychedelic. So you have a large amount of adrenochrome in your head 24/7, which causes you to “trip”. This is where it gets metaphysical. That constant “trip” is like a spiritual “gate” to the “realm of consciousness”, which is the place w
here consciousness is formed. There are coherent beings there, but they appear to oversee the thought process of multitudes. When you “gate” to that realm, you’re basically standing out like a sore thumb there, and the beings lock on to your “signal” and interact with your reality, causing all kinds of interesting synchronicities. These are beings that have transcended time, so the signs that synchronize with you might not even be immediate. Some of the connections you make (most of them) will be self-made, but others will be blatantly obviously pointed at your living situation. It’s usually the worst with live audio. Makes you feel like everybody’s watching you, but that’s not really true, at least on earth. So basically, your brain injured state is causing you to “trip”, and you’re producing a surplus of spiritual “signal”, so the powers that be are making the best of it somehow. But they don’t really know how to heal you, so they’re just going to mess with you. Worst case scen
ario, you don’t make it, and on the other side you’ll have a nice big payout, from all the donations people gave you for your suffering. Best case scenario, you heal the brain injury fully and feel like you did in the before-times. But not really. Since you’ve made an impression and “they” are still interested in you. So you’ll be a little “crazy”, hearing secret messages here and there."

175923216,"My son was a chemistry major and worked in biotech for about 4 months before he had his worse psychotic break. He is now homeless and in and out of places to get help. He's has a 140 IQ but the best job for him was working in the warehouse of a flower show, total manual labor. He could chose to interact or not. Not a ton of money, but was a good fit for his diagnosis."
175923217,My diagnosis have been consistent since 2013. SZA. and ID… It upsets me that they changed them before from Bipolar mixed affective disorder to SZA. And also they said I had BPD traits which has been taken off now as well as ASD traits… I feel they made a mistake with all them before and I’m questioning the current dxes of SZA and intellectual disability dxes as they’ve made mistakes before. I don’t feel I have a mental illness and they say I lack insight?
175923218,"I thought I had just a normal 6 monthly appointment with psychiatrist on Wednesday just gone - to discuss my community treatment order. An AMHP social worker turns up. In the meeting she asks me about my thoughts around my current CTO, I told her I was indifferent, told her I like it but don’t like taking the depot medication. She asked me about my last hospitalisation in 2016 and the psychosis which I seriously harmed myself cutting a microchip out my armpit. They decided to renew it for another year. I’m not that bothered really. I have been on a continuous community treatment order since 2011. I believe I haven’t got anything mentally wrong with me, does this prove that I do? Do you think when you cross over into self harm from psychosis they’ll continue renewing CTO every year as they are worried if not on medication I’ll cut microchip out again? I have been on a continuous CTO since 2011. Is that the longest a persons been on?"

175923220,I was thinking an energy drink app – pros and cons of each one and the local prices at stores…lol That and a dsm-5 or health app sort of thing where it lists all the medical symptoms and conditions and treatments. Could be useful for doctors.

There’s two cats here who visit, one is more shy than the other, and we feed them well when we visit but the sad part is the shy one has to be present for us to feed both, otherwise the more comfortable of the two just eats both helpings.

175923231,"Although there’s been discussion of it there’s never been an actual diagnosis of it. Well today the clinician I saw said he officially wanted to diagnose me. I’m not sure why he did but he did. Maybe he wanted me to work on it more or get some validation on what I’ve already worked on. Maybe he just wanted me to know he knew I survived it. Because you know, I survived it. And for anyone struggling with past trauma I want you to know you can get through this. For me in the end it was about putting in down and that was ended the torture. That and my abuser died. That really helped a lot too."

175923239,"Fully agree. I found out after getting discharged from the head injury clinic that they were fully shocked I made it that far. They thought I would be a lifer lol but at a certain point I was like “Okay what’s next?” And the doctors said “Nothing. There’s no extra steps. You are at 100% functioning level.” I tried to convince them to keep treating me anyways, to see if I could become even better, but they said insurance wouldn’t cover it and I couldn’t afford to pay OOP"

I cant stand this anymore… I almost have only her and she keeps saying, that i’ll always suffer… Maybe she smashed me more than i think no??? I ended up by not saying her all and i should keep the hope for feeling better only for me… I feel like my mother is the only one on this earth, who says that ill always be in pain… Why she keeps believing it? If i argue with her on this, she says, that she knows better and that she is realistic… Why is she like that for god sake???"

Most people have probably have some sort of issue with loud neighbours or when living many people in a household we have to compromise and just let things pass as to not make a hostile environment. They put up with me, so I have to put up with them mentality. I guess the most important is that he doesen’t play loud tv when you are trying to sleep. But if it is a big problem for you then maybe try to explain it, otherwise I would try to just not get annoyed by it."

175923265,That’s tough. You could talk to him about how his classmates might need encouragement to enter the world outside of high school. They may need some kind of saying to think of when it gets tough. They also could be encouraged to remember to have fun and enjoy life.

I’ve never acted on these feelings but it’s a worry. I’ve been writing myself loads of enraged emails to get some relief. I read them a few days later & they sound raving mad.
175923274,lol is that sarcasm
175923275,I struggle to respect anything I perceive none-the-less how I feel. The world proves me wrong over and over again as does what I see. I envy your confidence in insecurity.

It is most likely still schizophrenia, leave diagnosis to professionals. The mistake I made I thought I had drug induced psychosis, the initial diagnosis was that because I told them the drugs I used over couple years, but they forgot to ask what I used hard-core drug previously. So after my schizophrenia diagnosis I had fetish like thinking that I had just drug psychosis and I would be fine without meds, turned out that I was wrong"

175923311,"One of my favorite quotes is by Mark _PERSON_, he said “comparison is the death of joy”. I think that also can mean comparing yourself to another version of you who doesn’t exist. Dealing with this disease is harder than med school or law school, it’s harder than a lot of jobs out there. It’s a hard illness to recover from, and you’re doing it! You are a superhero to those who still have a long way to go with recovery. Try to remember when you wish for someone else’s life or even another version of your life that there are people who wish for the life you live right now. That’s an awesome feeling, in my opinion.

No. It's more about being allowed to cry, than it is about crying in itself. Not being able to cry feels worse than crying. Often i feel there is ""something"" right under the surface of my awareness but it's eluding me. It's nagging that something isn't right but I can't get to what is not right. My life feels empty without this something. I almost never cry when I am with other people, that would just feel horrible (inner critic beating me up). And then there is also the risk of getting ""comforted"" by them. Such horror"

175923330,I’ve not had luck on sims on play station but it was much easier on pc. I suggest playing it on pc

175923332,"A few years ago, I visited my _NAME_ mater and where I spent lots of my time, the library. Here’s what it looks like: image1024×764 257 KB It is a concrete and glass behemoth. On my visit, I perused the psychology floor. There were seemingly endless amounts of books, so I began looking for something simple to read. I found a book with psychological medical terminology. It hounds me to this day that I did not write down the title or author but my best guess it was from the late 70’s early 80’s. I copied each definition word for word in a journal I had. I like to share information, so here it is.

175923333,Really? That’s great
175923334,That’s really strange. It’s never happened to me though.
175923335,"Well, you’re not."
175923336,What kind of psychiatrist was that ?!?! I’m completely shocked. That’s a pretty disturbing thing to say.
175923337,"LS! I have two laptops. A twelve years old Asus with Bang and Olufsen sound. It has an i7 processor but is real slow. I installed some expensive software on it: a dictionary, Office Professional. And I have a two year old 14 inch HP with 1128 GB memory. I needed memory for my music, Apple iTunes with 100 GB music. If you buy a new laptop my advice is to check whether you want to carry it around. Does it fit into your bag and is it not too heavy?"
175923338,"I am struggling too, you are not alone in this. I’ve had to buy a few diffusers for my house and play calming music quite often. Just remember, there’s millions of people out there looking for support and to help support all the same. We are here with you."
175923339,I have that! I just don't always mark it off lol
175923340,"Yeah, i start to think it too… Our cognitive deficits dont help either… So you somatize as well with this, isnt it?? The numbness can cause heaviness too… our brain is like clogged i guess from despair and not thinking well… Its a poor health too now from the inactivity. Thats why its imperative that you start to move. You’ll feel better after time, believe me… The negatives can be beaten by efforts, believe me! Well, youll see but try to fight a bit yeap."
175923341,"Hmm?. Fine, , , Since _AT_MENTION_ Said You Can Stay _AT_MENTION_, You Can Stay. But!, Seriously. I Haven’t Delved Into _PERSON_’s Discography. But!, ‘Only Time’, Is A Masterpiece!. And She Even Got It Onto A Commercial Lately. Which Is Rare For Such Song’s. Last Time I Heard A Very Noble Song On Television Was From ‘The Flaming Lips’. It Was Quite The Trip. . .

174334024,What others are you on?
175923342,"You just got aggressive out of nowhere, You’ve got a problem, man."
175923343,I’m sorry you are in anger. Hope you will find peace with it all. My closest family I love most I left and I was with them daily and since I moved away from them I am alone with my new dog and I miss them so much and am trying not to live with so much regret for leaving but embrace the present and appreciate all the good I have here. I have a good life here. But I was happier with my x n girls in sa. I appreciate my former stepmother calls me and that makes me happy. I need my alone time but every now and then I long for lasting relationships and someone to hang out with or chat with. Can you try meditation? I started listening to guided meditation two days ago. Difficult when you are angry to have the patience to listen but you can try. When I was a child I experienced and felt incredible anger. Very intense but it went away thankfully. I’m more peaceful now. Wishing you a happy peaceful existence.
175923344,is that _NAME_ merchant?

174334026,She also said something along the lines of it may have gone undetected cause of the schizophrenia. Something like that anyway.
175923351,I sent an email to my past psychiatrist to see if we could have appointment to discuss a possible mistake of diagnosis. I sent him a scientific article attached to the email. 5 days passed and he didn’t answer. Today I sent him a WhatsApp message and I know he read the message because WhatsApp let me know when someone reads my messages. He didn’t answered as well. I’m confused. He didn’t took so long to answer my messages when I was his patient and I’m willing to have a paid appointment with him. I’m not sure if I’m too anxious and should take some air or if he is ghosting me.
175923352,"I see, that is worth looking into. That’s an awesome suggestion."
175923353,That’s true. I’m still grateful I get to spend thanksgiving with my dad so I don’t have too much more to complain about.
175923354,That’s a good sign. Well I guess just keep a open mind. What you are experiencing might not mean something. I guess the best way to go about it is to consider yourself healthy and just see what happens. If things go relatively well then you probably don’t have anything to worry about. And remember there is no such thing as being normal in this world anyway. If you feel that you are different somehow than others it might not mean that you have a mental condition by any means.
175923355,Yeah feel your pain. I give most of mine to dad but I still have enough to have a bit of fun. And yes…it’s payday today for me as well.
175923356,To be honest i think people with mental illness should never be exposed to social media there is so much harmful content and but so is the news people are exposed to more violence from social media and the tv its even affecting young people and there mental health but 30 years ago we didn’t have this or things where traumatic like 9/11 or things like school shootings but as we got closer to the 2005 its got worse and worse and made more people get away with picking vunrable people and making there lifes hell have lost a family member died by suicide id never want someone else to go through that there are always people out to get vulnerable people make them more of a target they can scam my partner e mail get spam and he is mentally well unlike me who is vulnerable but he can see that the e mail is fake and that its click bate but if i was unwell and send my details they can con you and make your life a living hell where all your money is gone if you don’t know the person personally dont add them 
or even message them back keep safe online everyone
175923357,"Personally, good hygiene and keeping the apartment clean. But since I live on my own, own a car, work and take classes the basic responsibilities pile up. So a basic thing is keeping my car clean and in good running order; that’s a must. Keeping food in the house, another must. Going to work clean and on time. Completing class assignments on time. These are the basics for me. Once I got those down pat I can occasionally cook a good meal, go to a drive thru restaurant in my car, relax on the couch in my living room, and sit here in the park and eat crackers in my car like I’m doing right this minute and as an added bonus for my health I’m going to take a walk. Life is way more difficult and complicated than I’m making it sound but it’s a beautiful sunny day with a nice gentle breeze and I can’t worry about crap 24 hours a day so I’m going to take it easy for an hour or so. and sit on a bench and enjoy the peace and quiet."

175923361,Counting from when _PERSON_’s was an official dx -1992/1994 (not sure which) .It took 25-27 years for me to get a dx of _PERSON_’s syndrome . Having a severe mental illness is certainly a barrier to getting diagnosed sooner rather than later.
175923362,i feel wonderful nowdays so i am not here alot but i have something may help you losing weight that is home digital scale it is features and technology are accurate and it is italian brand you no longer need to weight on different scales which is not good of course this techonology is good and no longer expensive at all you can watch out your progress even day by day i lost so far after i bought it 2.5 kg in very small period notice not to weight yourself after drinking or eating have nice time i ask god for you to be fine and in good shape! you see it is so cute !!! i was struggling becoz of scales different and go to weight in the right time and even laziness

175923365,Every 3 months. They can’t do anymore for me so it just seems like a waste of time.
175923366,I do think psychosis can utilize this method of thwarting one’s own comfort. But it’s all internal. it’s between you and your illness. You’ll never find any valid external factors. Good luck.
175923367,"Sounds like you do need to go to rehab. I’ve been. It’s not bad. They give you medicine for the withdrawals and it’s like one long therapy session. You should make some calls and try to get in as soon as possible. At the very least, go to the ER and make sure what you’ve taken wasn’t laced."
175923368,I’m learning that I’m ok as long as I don’t get my expectations too high. If I am socially feeling awkward I just excuse myself and others can do the same to me without fear of a bad reaction.
175923369,Okay I’m glad you don’t want to carry through. I hope you start feeling better soon.

175923372,Well I talked to the finance lady and the max I could probably get is $50 to 80 grand so that’s 4 to 7 machines so I would keep my job and this would be part time. I really want 14 or 15 machines so I could quit my job but will have to work up to that. So I will still be working for the man.
175923373,Sorry I don’t mean to encourage this relationship I mean I personally wouldn’t unless she actually meets up with you soon and stuff like that? And tells you why the number is from Hong Kong lol. But it seems shady actually. She’s not even from Hong Kong. So u know… _PERSON_

I’m currently a nurse student (in Romania nursing is teached in college along with pharmacy and medicine, it takes 3 years and a lot of theory) and have a basic knologe of medicine. I’m thinking I will finish college and try to get a job in a hospital wich pays four times minimum wage after taxes. And then see how I will like it after a couple of years then maybe try something else. Or not, maybe it will grow into me"
175923376,"I’ve experienced dreams of my head being run through wood saws, my brain being impaled by long stilettos, my body being hacked to pieces by serial killers wielding butcher knives, of being shot through the head by a single bullet at point blank range, to being bomblasted by a torrent of bullets. All of these being fully felt in all their pain and leading to my death and then my sudden awakening."
175923377,That sucks! I finally got a refill on my Flonase so my nose may finally cooperate with me soon... I hope you start to feel better quickly!

174334025,I'm doing well. The day started off rough but I adjusted my attitude and mood. I also took a 4 hour nap.
175923381,"I wasnt on 20mg back then, its after I relapsed off meds that they put me on 20mg. Maybe psychosis did damage and I needed a higher dose to be stable after. I was on 10 or 15mg. I dont remember the steps but at the end I was on 5mg pills then 2mg pills then nothing."

175923389,"Yes I’m okay, planning what should I buy tho"
175923390,I’d agree. Color them and see how you go! I’m not a bad artist. I can do things like buildings and trees. People escape me. I just don’t have an eye but I can do a still life pretty good. Art is fun. My first depressive breakdown I did a lot of oil paintings. Most of those I don’t have as people in my life kept them. To me that is cool.
175923391,Thanks juke. How long has she been taking perphenazine?
175923392,I dont feel well and I dont totally know why. I think my ear is infected and I'm scared it has spread to my jaw and nose because those have been aching all day. I also have a headache coming on.
175923393,Thanks for the kind responses you three.
175923394,I get Invega Sustenna injections. It’s going well so far.
175923395,"That is such a good idea to record sessions or take notes from them. I am definitely going to try that. Also _AT_MENTION_, as for something you can do remotely, could you try audio transcription? I am currently doing that and it doesn't pay great, but it pays... I am starting this week at it. It's just an idea; you don't have to give it second thought if you don't want to. But it's an idea. Ha."
175923396,"Thank you so much for that kindness, I needed that and appreciate you very much. I just feel like seeings and hearing things doesn’t nessesarly make you mentally ill. I feel enlightened and want to explore it and figure it out."
175923397,Ever since I became sza and even before I had trouble sleep I think always had low melatonin i baught 120 capsules 10mgs each tielme release and I’m going to take two I also heard that it can help protect tolemeras witch is good if you want to live longer I’m trying to get to 100 years old

175923401,"Yup, was a hair washing day too."
175923402,I would guess that our next upgrade will fix the problem. I know some sites have unsupported formats for shadowboxing.

174334038,"So my priority is to stay sane. I have never managed more than six months sanity in the last twenty odd years. Staying sane for five years would be a miracle. I want to complete two courses over the next five years, a three year course in shiatsu and a two year masters (part time) in health economics. I started the shiatsu course (term one) and only managed half of it before I relapsed and had to drop out. This year does not look promising for starting either due to the COVID lockdown. With regards to the masters, even if I have no positive symptoms over the two years, my negative symptoms will be a problem as study at that level is intensive. I want to read the core text for the masters and also around the subject for at least a year before applying, so that I can lessen the load of actual study when I’m doing it. If I can basically learn the material of the masters before doing it, then it might be possible to complete, even if I experience relapses. As I said, my priority is to remain sane. Th

175923405,"Thanks, yeah, I just now ran out of regular coffee after this morning and won't be buying any more regular, I'll buy some decaf next week. I'm sure it wasn't helping things. I was only drinking it because I had it and was out of decaf"
175923406,I knew something was wrong when I began to hear a voice in my head that would insult me constantly at times. It’s hard to resist a diagnosis when that’s happening.

175923409,"Yeah suppose your right , I had to tell someone it’s the only way I could’ve rationalised it, counsellor would’ve thought I was mad if I got one"
174334030,Thanks for giving updates regularly! Awesome stuff.
175923410,I never had that issue I guess. I don’t know if its because I didn’t have an overwhelming need for attention or if it was just because I always got it when I needed it. I was never one of those people who got upset when the attention wasn’t on me though.
175923411,"First of all, genes can be dormant. You can have a gene for something without it being active, therefore your parents can carry the genes without having the disease themselves. Also, brains aren’t fully developed until around age 25. Therefore, some deficiencies only show themselves later."
175923412,That is very cool!
175923413,"I think when I was younger I would have been more open to that, but I feel more vulnerable mentally now. Weaker. I do like that feeling when your half asleep though so maybe. I don’t know, maybe. It’s cool you tried it. It’s really interesting that you heard music."
175923414,I’d like to say that I was on to this charade a week before anyone caught up. User is asking about symptomology again…leading to medical advice. Go look at the threads of hers that were locked and you’ll see what I mean. NO FREETHINKING ALLOWED
175923415,Woke up thinking this about the person who used to wake me up to go to school.
174334035,"Mostly on abilify and store a,low doses.I been on antipsychotic for total of 10 years,two years culmulative off them.My official diagnosis is schizo,seen it on doctors paper,but I don’t believe it…"

175923420,"I was on Loxapine (I think it’s chemical structure is similiar 2 perphenazine) and I was completly dead on it. Didn’t wanna move, talk or do anything at all. Like a friggin horse tranquiler or something."
175923421,i think a lot of people end up homeless there and/or kill theirselves.
174334037,"For sure. My cognitive decline was first diagnosed as ADHD, and a later Pdoc prescribed the meds but didn’t articulate the disorder. Full years went by, before I looked up Schizophrenia on Wikipedia. The silver lining is that I worked longer(by hook or by crook) and my SSDI is probably higher."
175923422,Congratulations!
175923423,I deal with that a lot. I find grounding helps a bit with it. But I haven’t found anything that makes it go away completely.
175923424,I hope it goes well!
175923425,Went to my course and this woman came and I just immediately felt connected with her and that I love her and that we were laughing together but that might have been my imagination. I made a birthday card . I had a bath and shaved and had chai tea.
174334034,I’ve been allowed to try Abilify Maintena. Hoping it will activate me.
175923426,"I know everyone is different, but I’ve been through many traumatic events at all stages of my life including serious head injuries, for me I’m convinced it’s trauma based, but from what my mom tells me my dad was in and out of mental health hospitals and may have had it but was unmedicated or something so I have the genetic side too. I think _AT_MENTION_ posted this a while ago that being born premature increases sz risk which I was and he was too."
175923427,Glad you and _PERSON_ are ok
175923428,As much as I find this an important topic to explore I myself find it very uncomfortable to express my views on it. Thanks for sharing though.
175923429,O.K see what you mean.
175923430,I start a job soon. I’ll be making 3500 a month for nine months. Job + ss. That will be the most I’ve ever made in my life. I know this is a poor outlook but I don’t think it’ll last. I’m too paranoid. When I went for my interview I was paranoid and almost left. I’m hoping and praying it works. I gotta pay for my kids braces.
175923431,I took my prescribed & a vitamin supplement.
175923432,"I hoard stuff because I don’t have the free headspace to organize my stuff. Too many forced thoughts about stupid things that aren’t relevant to my immediate needs. Basically inflammation is pushing on too many parts of the brain and making me think too hard, making me overly analytical and aware, to the extent that I hallucinate meaning on sounds and such."
175923433,What do you want it to say? I think I can do it from my phone

175923435,"I agree. But there are people who genuinely need all that treatment, and I think it’s good for them to be able to receive that level of care"
175923436,_AT_MENTION_ What fears do you have?
175923437,I’m sorry you are in so much pain _AT_MENTION_. It’s a good idea to have it medically checked. Best of luck!
175923438,I am so sorry for your loss. It is a process. I recommend reading “On Grief and Grieving”. The author is a Dr. and also lost a child. Stay safe and be well.
175923439,"Yeah, i have heard that too. My plan is to stay on antabuse for a couple of weeks and then stay sober without afterwards."
175923440,I want a black forest cake

175923445,"Copy/Paste from another thread Very depressed. Grief, shame and guilt kicking our ***. Been having sui thoughts for a while. The IOP T and our pdoc both brought up the hospital. Pdoc was a little more pushy about it but after giving mom one of our meds and pdoc talking to Mom, she felt a little more comfortable with not calling the police to come check on us. At this point, we are most likely going to tell the IOP T tomorrow that we need to go to the hospital. We've been making stupid decisions (IOP T knows)... We keep telling everyone that we can stay safe, but honestly we really can't. When we leave IOP, we don't know if we'll be there in the morning. (Don't worry, right now we are not intending on doing anything to hurt ourselves like that. We will be at IOP tomorrow.) We're just tired of everything... We want to go to sleep and never wake up. We want to be with someone who is already gone... We just want to not be alive anymore."

As long as I don’t expect myself to pull in 6 figures and settle down into a family anytime soon like I did before I got sick, I’m able to stay happy. It’s also important to stay away from prejudiced people. That’s kind of a personal one for me."

It is great to hear that the panic attacks are gone and that you have reached your wean goals...but maybe this has caused some increase in your IBS and symptoms? I hope that by keeping a food/symptom diary you can maybe spot some patterns and learn how to best manage the issue. Great to hear also that you are working again. I do hope that you are enjoying your job and finding satisfaction in it as well as meeting people and having new experiences that are positive!

Idk how I go from routinely taking it to forgetting 1 day and then forgetting other, different, days too. I suspect when fiancé’s friend came to stay for 2 nights it threw me off my routine and I’ve forgotten some days here and there since then... which probably made me sick., again. I can’t leave my house anymore. I physically am Afraid to. And my paranoia is extremely high snd I’ve been somewhat having delusions off and on and a lot of hallucinations. Depression and very severe anxiety too"
175923486,I'm so sorry about your hospitalization. I've learned to be really thankful that hospital support is there though. I agree with _PERSON_. You can learn to manage it with some effort. I've learned to accept every bit of help I can get that will help me to manage it. You can definitely get a handle on it for periods of time. I'm currently in a stretch of almost four years with no hospital stays so that is great progress for me. It seemed like I was going in back to back for a long time. I'm pulling for you to get better and to have stability.

174334046,"Ya some of the side effects of schizophrenia are called negative side effects as opposed to positive, one of which is called anhedonia I think, I may have spelled it wrong. This sorta encompasses some of what you may be talking about. Also it can feel like cognitive issues when one isn’t getting the positive symptom of racing thoughts (positive meaning additive not beneficial). So. A slight slow down in reaction time seems to just go with the territory of meds. That being said, overall I think you will prefer the medicated experience to that of the symptomatic schizophrenic experience."

175923494,Why it makes us do dangerous things then?
175923495,I was attacked very badly last night for the first time in ages. It is so scary being met with such a malevolent force. At one point I fought it off enough to fall asleep and I woke up to it again which almost never happens so it was very scary and I had to pull out big guns to get it to leave. It was a massive relief when it left. I didn’t wake up my boyfriend for any of it which he would disapprove of. Why? I dont really know. Thinking about what happened makes me a bit too anxious to sleep now. It’s only 6 am though.

175923504,"Where did caged go? I don't think I normally unjustifiably push people away; however, I recently did something like this. I made causal friends with a peer who I have a lot of differences with but our interactions were often quite enjoyable. Our differences and everything that I found not valuable in her got louder the more other stressors, retraumatization and grief came up in my life last fall - and I no longer saw much benefit or ""pay off"" to the friendship. I displaced some of my stress and grief onto her. She was surprised, concerned, hurt, yet tolerant. Seeing her patience/tolerance showed me that she really did have some level of value in the friendship. ^ Especially since most women are miserable ######6 bitches. So I started backing off further and further and further. I'm completely distant now. We only talk if we're at the same place at the same time and even then, I still do my best to avoid her (and all my peers in this situation). Polite though and cordial with her. Part of it is I'
m ashamed that of all people I could get like that with, it had to be with one of the fair and few inbetween females that aren't @@@@@@@. I'm never the person to be ""that person"" I'm the one who ######6 hates ""that person"" Part of it is I've forgotten how to be the more dysfunctional person within a dynamic. I have too much pride to be the more dysfunctional one. Part of it is I can't guarantee I won't be an bitch right now and I don't want to have to take others into account. The last reason is maintaining the friendship is too much work, and as valuable as she's shown her behavior to be, there's still not enough payoff (at least for now) - I place some moral judgement on myself for this. I like when they're all at a distance. I feel like I can breathe again."

175923508,"I got TD symptoms for about six weeks after I stopped a 30 mg daily dose of Haldol. My tongue would move around in my mouth (it didn’t actually stick out) and I would get tics in my feet and hands. My pdoc recommended Benadryl at night to help with the tics and it helped a little. It stopped on its own once the Haldol was out of my system. I had switched to Zyprexa at the same time, but my pdoc said she didn’t think it was causing the TD symptoms since I had successfully been on Zyprexa before. She was right that it was coming off the Haldol. I am so grateful it stopped!"

I had the grades to transfer to medicine but sz hit hard my grades before I finish the required amount of courses to do the transfer.

175923577,Thanks Jukebox
175923578,I got munchies on the pot way back when I was a skinny dude. I get munchies on zyprexa and I really got them on risperdal. It’s not easy to deal with but I try to exercise as much as I can. Sometimes it’s hard but I’m getting better all these years later. Still. I don’t mind a treat and every now and then a morning tea of cream donuts is the bomb! It’s hard but eat healthy. Snack on low calorie and thus bland foods if possible!
174334060,Maybe it was 12 I don’t know exactly I bought them in 3s nonstop
175923579,I see ok! That actually makes me feel a bit better. _PERSON_ I don’t wanna like cheat on my taxes or anything. I wanna be a responsible citizen. I have a optimistic belief that my writing business will likely boom within a year to 2 years tho!

175923581,My first full on psychotic episode which lasted for many months began at age 16.
175923582,Good to hear man!
175923583,Dont you think its expensive?
175923584,I surprised that they started you on such high does.
175923585,I’m happy for you that you found something just right.
175923586,"The original Kemetic hieroglyphs of the tombs of the Nile are embossed. The ones of _NAME_ are inscribed. Egypt is a foreign name for Kemet apparently, the Egyptians were enemies who submitted to the intelligence of the Nubians, again labels may be problematic. The Greeks tell of how _NAME_ was anointed, the Rastas dispute this as pure propaganda, the Arabs I am told are not looking after the relics, the origins remain a mystery, I’m sure Cleopatra was the Sphynx."
175923587,Gremlins is a kick ass movie for sure. I am pretty fond of gremlins 2 - the new batch. Have you seen it?
175923588,The fact is you can do it but appear like can’t do it. So the only way to manage it is by forcing yourselves to do it.
175923589,Machines don’t bleed.
175923590,"I think that’s absolutely bonkers, no offense. It makes zero sense. Telepathy doesn’t exist. And even if it did, there would be no reason for someone to orchestrate such a ridiculous plot against you specifically. Our illness lies to us and tells us we’re the center of the universe. But the truth is, you’re just a guy. Nobody would go through such great lengths of spying on two people you know, monitoring the speed and flow of traffic in your area, then telepathically mimicking their voice to you to convince you to leave the house at the exact time to get you to pass them at an intersection. It’s not possible to predict traffic in such a way, and it’s not possible to predict human behavior in such a way. If this was a plan by people, 9/10 times you would leave at the wrong time, or traffic would be slightly too slow or fast, or your coworker or _PERSON_ would be turning a different direction, and you’d never run into each other. Therefore, this must be hallucinations."

174334058,"Schizophrenia, a complex, [chronic brain disorder that affects around 3.5 million people in the United States, is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, lack of motivation, and cognitive issues. It’s not talked about as much as other types of mental illness, such as depression and dementia, and misconceptions are rife – which may be partly due to how it’s been portrayed in the media. So what movies get schizophrenia right, and what ones get it wrong?"

175923634,Are there any support forums/support groups for depressed 80 year olds.
175923635,Well having nothing to lose does give you a certain advantage. But if you’ve lost your mind you’re not really going to be able to utilize that advantage. So I find this statement kind of silly. Just makes me think of those old people who have dementia and die alone in nursing homes with nothing. Depressing.
175923636,"some people have it better than others. i envy the people on here that don’t hallucinate for example. life is what you make of it. But some people do have it better than others. i also envy the people where medication works for them to take the hallucinating away. look at people in extreme poverty or worn torn countries. They might have a better attitude than a lot of americans and make the best of what they have. But americans no matter their income level, if they hallucinate or not, or illness would probably have it better."

175923641,"I think guys and girls can just be friends in a scenario where they grew up together. That is really the only case where I have seen successful, long lasting straight guy girl friendships. The other scenario I see it in is when you have mixed gender friend groups. However often people who start out as “friends” in these groups end up dating. However my boyfriend is in an online friend group with guys and girls and they don’t date each other. Most likely because most of them already have partners and in reality they don’t live near each other so a relationship wouldn’t go anywhere anyways."

175923663,"Everyone is at least a little bisexual. Everyone has different types. That means that some people associate in certain situations, masculine as feminine and vice versa. Like how pink used to be a male colour in the 1920's. To me, you look very female. Some males and females are androgynous and can be both and can be perceived as either or. It goes deep into the realms of reality where you can even have masculine and feminine personalities. Anyways I'm a demi-heteromantic demisexual (Asexual, gay, straight, bisexual, etc) and confused. Someone in high school called me gay because a likely gay guy kept hitting on me and I said that I didn't want to date a girl that liked me. We're all basically multiple gender mushrooms because no one looks the same so right now, there's 7.5 billion genders and they change and morph with time and space."

Who else went through the hard sedation of the meds? But I can be agitated and paranoid from the illness, but in this illness I am also kind of a dead zombie on the other hand.

175923687,Where does it say that taking Melatonin causes dependence?
175923688,Hi welcome to the forum. Never a good idea to stop psych meds abruptly. Does your psych know? Pot can give you psychosis all of it’s own and it’s wise to avoid it and other streets. If you get side effects let your doc know. Trying to deal with these sorts of issues going solo usually isn’t a good idea.
175923689,I hope not. I take250 mg every month

I'm a 105lb female and I have to take 6 to 10mgs (depending on other factors like my pain level/other meds ive taken)for it to have the desired effect of actually helping to put me in a sleep that lasts at least three or four hours. 3 mgs makes me slightly drowsy/I might fall into a light sleep for an hour two.

And then when your other medication reaches it's full potential, reevaluate and take less if you're able."

Psychoeducational programs are state-of-the-art interventions that consist in delivering stabilized patients with accurate knowledge about their illness and its treatment. Evidence suggests a significant relationship between levels of illness-related knowledge and insight in SZ patients. However, the effect of psychoeducation on these related outcomes needs to be explored further.In this open label study involving 30 French-speaking patients with SZ, we propose to compare levels of knowledge and insight before and after the French P.A.C.T.® psychoeducation program to investigate how this approach affects both outcomes.

174334110,"During my teenage and early 20s I did not exercise at all. Well, I have been forced now to exercise and eat well, if I want to keep my cognition. This is the third month I have been running, and as the research studies suggested should happen around this point with schizophrenia and running, at the third month mark I am seeing a cognitive resurgence. I doubted the running was doing much, after all, I hadn’t seen any changes for a long time… This week I am exploding with creative fervor. I have returned to the novel I wrote before I was diagnosed and am reworking it into a short story. I am also working on a book of poetry for a competition. I have also been trying to complete a coherent narrative about my experience with the disorder for years, and I completed it smooth as butter in four hours (on the second draft now). I even did some digital art! Writing is the one thing that I was really good at that I could no longer do well because of cognitive issues. I still have trouble responding and u
nderstanding socially, but I think that will also improve with time and practice. The most important part is I have the thing that is my greatest skill in life returning. I wanted to be an author before the damn disease caught me. Most of the time I don’t even want to run. I certainly have skipped days. But I always go back and run more. Much to my surprise, it is making a massive difference! The studies I looked at said any intensive aerobic exercise made a huge difference in schizophrenia and cognition. I doubted it, I admit. But I can’t credit this change to anything else. I thought I might share here, to inspire. If anyone else is trying and thinking of giving up, try a little longer! I waited what feels like a long time but really wasn’t and the results are stupendous!"

175923839,"yea even people are telling im going to be okay, my brain is still not convince, i have very stubborn brain that doesnt shake it beliefs its so strong it makes feel so real. _PERSON_ i will talk to a therapist today thanks, i hope she can help me."

175923842,I’m happy to hear you got a good sleep in leafy.
174334119,My body is recovering and so is my mind. Schizophrenia is knowing nobody loves you. I have known that for far too long. To know that my parents only love me because I am their son.
174334113,"I was living in _NAME_ with my dad who physically abused me as a kid. I found out through memories resurfaced and from my dad when I escaped that situation that I was raped when I was six years old. My dad is not a horrible person, but he is a broken person who has hurt a lot of people. He got me addicted to crystal methamphetamine, which absolutely destroyed my life as a person pretty naive to drugs and because . . . schizophrenia and meth do not ??????? mix, to say the least. When my dad cut me off I started having sex with strangers to get it. I escaped back home to San _NAME_ to live with my mom and brother, but was struggling to maintain sobriety. I then found out that during a poker match where my dad invited random tweaker strangers into the house, I was raped in the spare room, age 6. Don’t remember by who, but I know my dad was complicit. I totally lost my mind then. I was completely unable to cope with the intense pain. My 5250 reads: “Patient attempted to cut out his tongue and jumpe
d out of a moving car in the setting of suspected medication noncompliance and methamphetamine use.” Well I am out of the hospital and am 40 days clean and sober. I met with my sponsor today, and I’m on the Fourth Step of Alcoholics Anonymous. I am clinging to hope of a new way of life. I am undergoing Lacanian psychoanalysis, which has been amazing for processing the trauma that induced my schizophrenia in the first place. I am also seeing a psychiatrist for medication management who practices in the Jungian analytical psychology school. I am exploring the deeper reasons why I have always struggled with medication noncompliance and substance use. I am scheduled to start IOP to cope better. And the doctors at the hospital were SO encouraging (to say the least) of my recovery. They truly saw the uniqueness of me as an individual and saw how much potential I had. It is my long-term goal to become a psychiatric nurse practitioner and receive postgraduate training in the Lacanian psychoanalytical school. And 
THE ONLY WAY to get there is substance abstinence and compliance with medication. When I left the hospital I told the doctors: “I am ready now to fully commit myself to the world and its imperfections.” And that is what I am doing and what I will do. I am taking my dual recovery one day at a time. I believe that my trauma has molded me into a more beautiful person, who MUST carry the weight, and make something out of it. I am trying, really, so hard. I am trying to remind myself that everything is as it should be. I will update this with more details later, but I’m glad to be back."

175923844,"I use a modified form of the exercise where I drape my head off the side of my bed until it touches the floor, then I bend my legs so the feet point up. That way I don’t need to put too much weight on my neck, and I still get the blood rush to my brain."

175923847,Be careful with supplements. I read somewhere that combined with antipsychotics ginkbo biloba can cause seizures in people taking antipsychotics because antipsychotics can lower seizure threshold.
174334130,"No, I live with my mom, brother, and step-father. I am on a waitlist for an apartment that is cheap and nice, but it’s like a 5 year wait list in california and I’m on year 1.5. There’s a shortage everywhere in california. That and I wouldn’t be surprised if I turned it down because I cannot function on my own. I would try it though just to see. Before the schizophrenia, I lived independently 500 miles away from home while in college. I lived in a dorm and a cooperative with 150 people… I think people have it worse than me because we are considered high functioning because we can use computers and the internet."

175923850,"You seem to be managing quite well at your current dose. I would not risk lowering your dose at this time because you could lose insight and land in the hospital. That would not be good during the COVID-19 pandemic, so just keep that in mind if you find yourself tempted to lower your dose."
175923851,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ . You’re really in a bind. I support your decision to not go to the place you think is cursed. I just wish you could go to the next town or something. Can you save up to take a lift or Uber? Or is money just too tight for that?
175923852,I tried some cbd oil for a while (with and without thc). It didn't have a significant impact on relieving my anxiety. I didn't have any negative reactions (worst of it was that they weren't very tasty).

175923857,"Yeah, ColorWare makes some awesome stuff. I've always wanted their NES switch and their NES switch pro controller, but they're sooo expensive. I wouldn't be surprised if they did something for the switch lite. I wonder what they'd do, though. They already have the NES and SNES switches. Not sure if they'd repeat that or do something totally different, but I wouldn't mind a DMG game boy theme. I would also like a kiwi lime one. Not the greatest color, but it's the color of my second game boy ever."

174334125,My old psychiatrist though I had schizophrenia and said that to my mum but because of my age she didnt want to diagnose me because it’s a scary world to live in when you have schizophrenia especially where I live. I am more aware now and that’s why my new psychiatrist doesnt think I am.

175923883,"I looked in my area and can't find a single support group for people with paranoid scitsophrenia. I am trying to learn coping skills, but at the same time talking to others helps me out. This site has some very kind people on it who have helped me, so I was wondering what other either groups in person or online groups there are for people with this illness. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Besides learning coping skills and taking my meds, and seeing my doctor/therapist, I think talking to others who have this might help me. Besides sharing, I want to learn from others who have this. I'd imagine they have some good ideas and want to learn their perspective on things. I'm trying to do everything I can to walk the path I intend to walk, so anything that helps me is a positive thing. Thank you for any help you can give me. You guys are a kind group of people and I could learn a lot from you all."

175923885,"It's interesting to look back and recognize how one might have 'turned out' differently. In my mind, this resembles a game of pool--all that interaction and indirection. Being a cerebral narcissist seems to have no redeeming features. A life fraught with pain. Possibly because the color felt oppressive like a brick wall or red dirt (as a child, whenever we drove past an embankment with that color of soil, my mother was wont to say, ""Red dirt means the soil is poor.""). However, now that you mention it, it's closer to what's called ""Venetian Red"", a color of oil paint that easily overpowers and ruins a composition. I have a painting downstairs in which I ran amok with that color. Made me leave off painting for years now, come to think of it"

I feel good. The day will be hard. I can see my cognition when I read. I forget most of the things and because my day contains always the same things, it makes me forget what I’ve done yesterday. But most of the time I don’t forget my appointments. If I look at the clock or the calander I forget instantly after locking at it. Like time would be just some random sort of thing. Because of the Tv program and having bright light at the room from outside, I know what period of the day it is. Talking and being social are the things I avoid, because can’t build up a conversation and when in it I burn out after couple of minutes hearing the other talking."

175923906,"Not all of the people you describe were always any of that. Many of us worked and lived just like normal people while dealing with our illness. Personally I supported a family of 7 for years. A better example would be someone with no life experience, never worked, always taken care of by someone else. But even then, those people have their own stress. The real issue is people jumping on the MI bandwagon yet who aren’t ill and making actual sick people look like jokes. Making MI look like something that can be cured in every case with a pill or walk in the woods. Making light of MI. When every person around begins claiming they are mentally ill then it makes the rest of us look like attention seekers and dilutes our chances of real help."

175923908,"Can you check through a mental health organization or local health or religious facility whether there is a support group that you could join? You would benefit from this in so many ways. There are very complex and opposing issues at play for you. You are a dependent adult, which seems to give your parents ""permission"" to give you instructions as if you were a minor. That's unfair on their part, but it is what it is. And you have a love relationship that puts you into direct conflict with them. So there's no easy solution, except working toward financial independence and moving out when you can. For now, find that support group. Don't do anything rash. And try to calm yourself down as best as you can. Tell your parents you need more time to consider their desires, while you keep any news of information about your boyfriend from them. Don't lie, but don't share. Good luck."

174334135,Welcome. We aren’t doctors and most of us hit the health system pretty hard with psychosis. Insight is rare but not unheard of. It’s basically about function. Are these symptoms causing you problems with function in your day to day life? If so then you need to get a referral to a psychiatrist from your local doctor. Psychosis isn’t pleasant and periods of it or depression are most likely brain damage. That is reason enough to seek some help.

Both can do it though. I’m pretty confident in saying any med that blocks D2 at all is gonna have some chance for akathisia. So there’s no antipsychotic without restlessness but some have lower chances of giving it to you."

174334153,"I agree with those that say it’s very common . I wonder how much this is something that occurs after psychosis/schizophrenia is present, or was present before psychosis/schizophrenia . I have very little interaction offline with others outside of that with my stepdaughter and granddaughters . My father lives in _NAME_ so I see him very infrequently. I’ve not seen my brother and sister since moving here 23 months ago . Even as a child I was not very proactive when it came to socially interacting with others …"

She’s got millions of fans worldwide and it’s especially likely someone would be wearing a _PERSON_ t-shirt if this was between 1985-1995.

175923988,Yeah the system here (at least for me) is that you usually see a pdoc for meds and a psychologist or therapist for therapy. I pay for both. Sometimes you can get good docs through insurance but my plan is pretty dismal so I have to pay for the services out of pocket. I have been seeing my psychiatrist like every 2-3 weeks (because I haven't been doing too well lately) and my psychologist like pretty much weekly.

Or just talk to a dr on the phone, that's what they're doing here in my town, so you don't have to leave and sit in a germy office. Also, I know how you feel. I have a weak immune system, don't know why. I don't have any disease that would cause it, it's just always been that way since I was a kid. I was sick for a month, finally feeling better and I had fluid in my lungs and cough and fever. I thought I had corona but when I had my phone appointment with the dr and told him my symptoms he said it did not sound like corona. He told me to use a different nose spray and now I'm fine. So yeah I think some of it could be paranoia and stress rather than actual corona. Try the yoga again, it really does help. Go along with youtube videos. Also, the weight loss sounds like stress, I don't know but doesn't sound like corona. I have a friend in Italy

175924027,"I used to occasionally have pretty hectic visual hallucinations years ago. Pretty much under control now. But I always think back to this one time I went for a stroll at night through my small town and I could see jet black looking humanoid creatures on all the rooftops around me. They were bending over and around,scurrying , contorting freakishly and jumping from rooftop to rooftop. They would notice me and whisper loudly about knowing that I can see them and that I was special somehow for being able to. I actually wasn’t scared at all. I felt completely at ease at the time. Anyway it’s a memory I frequently return to ponder on. Its quite amazing to think we have the ability to create such experiences unconsciously. Anyone else have interesting hallucination memories?"
175924028,"When I was 20, my pdoc did just that, he gaslighted me. Took advantage of my youth. He was definitely in it for the money."

175924182,"First post and exploring the set up here. I can't ask a Q until I have five comments. I like that I can say anything in my first post, it's an opportunity to just get it out and write out my thoughts honestly. Talking about all this openly, for what it is and all that comes with it, is new and hard. Living with a partner with hidden mental illness is isolating, and the partner unwittingly adapts and adopts while their world gets smaller and smaller. I wonder how hard it is sometimes for some people to be diagnosed if they have a covert personality -- along with a long list of other behaviors. When there seems to be such tidy checklists for diagnosing this illness or that but what if they cross so many of those neat lines? They can hide themselves so well that the world at large, and even their nearest and dearest, would never suspect or have an inkling of the real person, the darkness of their history or their internal workings. Their outward mask is so shy, sweet and gentle that people who meet th
em actually voice aloud how that person is so relaxing and calming to be around that they 'glow'. Every public or social interaction can turn into a challenge for me as the world gives me feedback that says one thing while the truth is entirely another. I come off wrong instead. I am still rather new to the dark reality of what was really going on for half my life. I did not know illness like this existed. I did not know someone could hide every moment of their life. I did not know what a psychotic break was. I did not know about obsession and pornography addiction. I did not know how blissfully blind a partner can be while thinking they have worked hard for and built one thing but it was something else the whole time -- and that all the clues are there looking backwards (if you know what to look for!). I did not know how easily people can be tricked. I feel frustrated, disoriented, dazed and more than a little unsettled. I'm trying to learn how to build support systems based on this new reality.

175924191,"Hi There, We are a family of 4, me and my wife and my 2 daughters (16 and 13). We live in australia. My 16 year old daughter has got serious anxiety and depression issues, developed over time, to an extent now that she gets all kinds of nightmares including thoughts on taking away her life. Over the past 3 months she has attempted it twice. WE have been very lucky as we have been supported by MH and Hospital Emergency support systems so far. We have been doing everything possible, CAMHS, Psychologist, Psychiatrist, Haemopathic meds etc. She is currently on anti depressant med (escitalopram 10mg) as well as seroquel (10mg) on a daily basis right now. While it seems to be helping to keep herself a little calmer in general but it does also keep her a bit dozed off as well. Historically, she has been a very introvert kind of a person, she wouldn't say much about her feelings to us as parents. As we know now, In her disclosures with psychologist and psychiatrist, she has admitted that she has been very 
unhappy with her schooling as she never had friends and felt mostly left out and bullied at times. We come from indian heritage. She was good academically and she had very high goals set for herself. She has been at a private school since childhood until grade 10 and has been among the top 10 students throughout. However, her anxiety and depressive moods got worse and worse year after year. To the point in grade 10 where she would skip classes sometimes and sit outside and cry. She would come home and cry at least twice a week if not more at times. She didn't want to be at that school and chose to go to a public school in grade 11. That public school is also quite competitive academically. She has been much happier at this new school this year as she has lots of her own friends now and she enjoys their company. That being all well and good, she still has got that same competitive mindset and any event related to academics, is enough to get her impulsive very quickly where she gets uncontrollable. This is all 
recent, in the past 4 months or so. One such event happend about 3 months ago and she lost it, left school and tried to walk through the traffic. Since then there have been another 2 incidents where we had to call upon ambulance/police to get her to Emergency and get looked after in psychiatric ward. We have been trying all we can and would appreciate any thoughts/feedback from forum/parents who are or have been in a simiilar boat to us. We need help to lift ourselves so we can deal with it positively. Main issue right now is that she has been in and out of hospital a couple of times lately and she has been on meds at the same time, she has lost about 3 weeks of school now and she is very very worried and scared as she has fallen so far behind already. I have been trying to get her to try/accept and drop subjects/school if she can accept that.....i am hoping for anything that could help her relieve her stress. Regards"

175924351,"I’d go if I got to pick the hospital. I’m told I’m stuck with the same one since they bill medicare, and it’s a really crappy hospital two hours’ drive to the south. It literally is the worst hospital I’ve ever been in. The local ones are kinda nice. Fortunately a voluntary stay at crisis care works just as well and is very nice. I often stayed in crisis care as long as possible because I just liked the food and the company. Every morning at Crisis Care I would be the first guy awake and down at the kitchen at 6 AM, eating my hard-boiled egg and cereal and waiting for smoke break. Usually there was good conversation during the smoke breaks, too,"

When she got into a 12 step program she admitted to me that she put coke in my bong hit and watched me turn ghost white. I never really noticed at the time but I suspect she could have done that more than once and I never knew the difference.

174334235,"So I am starting up my attempts at dating , this is obviously not the optimal year for it but a woman liked me on match and I have been messaging her for 4 days and I think it is going pretty well. So far I have been just discussing interests and backgrounds and I feel like we have quite a few things in common and it just feels good so far. I went through a divorce over 3 years ago, shortly after being diagnosed which wasn’t due to a majority of schizophrenia related happenings. I bring this up because 2 years ago I tried dating a girl I knew from a while back, didn’t even get the chance to bring up schizophrenia as she was talking to someone else at the same time and trying to move forward pretty quick. I have had some off and on attempts at online dating but nothing really went past a day or so of talking, I just hadn’t been able to previously conversate well enough but I feel like my new antidepressant is really helping me talk and enjoy it more. Plus I think I am in to this woman, she see
ms like my type and that is not an easy feat ha. I just told her I thought she was pretty and she said she thought I was handsome, I really hope things can move in a good direction. I don’t plan on bringing up mental health issues until after I know things move forward more, I just don’t know the way to do so. How have any of you who have had success in relationships handled things? Any suggestions? I hate that I can’t be who I used to be preschizophrenia, but I would like to live as full of a life as possible and that includes finding someone I guess."

It’s unhealthy, but I just can bring myself to have the motivation to cook if it’s just for me. I only ever cook for loved ones. Don’t you also have two jobs? That leaves little time to eat properly. Hope you’re doing well freak buddy."
174334234,My last medication paliperidone had a weeks leeway. Like if it was given a week late it was not so much of a big deal. However I know some medications like risperdal MUST be on time. Just wondering where aripiprazole falls into this category. I liked having a bit of leeway.
175924394,Love comes creeping like a stalking cat in the silent dark

175924411,People don’t generally go after important peoples ex girlfriends/spouses. Look at _PERSON_ for example. Lots of people are out to get him but do you hear about anyone going after _PERSON_? I’m sure your fine. You didn’t participate in anything as far as I can tell so I see no reason why these countries would be out to get you. I don’t know what else I can say to reassure you.

174334236,I've gotten a genetic test and no antipsychotic medication will work for me. I'm currently taking risperdal and that's doing nothing. Possible trigger: I still have plans on harming myself and others. They're only getting worse. I want to die. There's no point in life if I can't do the things in life I always wanted to do. Possible trigger: I'm considering buying/stealing a gun just so I can go to prison for the rest of my life where I belong.

Humans are capable of anything. That is to say: You’re missing out on a great song, BUT (and this is the important bit) you never have to do anything you don’t want to do Ever. It’s just music. What i think? I’ll send it privately. If anyone stumbles on this thread, let’s keep your dignity and mine too. That’s a helluva thing to live with inside your brain. I’ll look for a link with just the audio, if you’re willing to hear the song by itself. But it’s just me sharing music. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to trigger you."
175924416,"I would say hauling hay was my toughest job. This was way back when they had 67 lb. bales that you had to pick up and stash in a barn. For one thing, it is hot, and it’s about 7 or 8 degrees hotter when you’re tossing the bales in a barn. There is all kind of dust and hay in the air, and after you’ve gone home you’ll be hauling out giant pieces of hay and snot from your nose. The first day I was on that job the guy I was with was drinking a ton of ice water after every load. So that’s what I did. That was where I found out that drinking that much ice water on a very hot day made me feel really bad. The next day I adjusted by drinking much less ice water, and hauling hay wasn’t nearly so difficult."

I guess it’s nothing new but I still feel sad seeing this"

I smoked k2 and that brought me completely over the edge, Had a complete psychotic break and started hearing voices, my concepts of reality were delusional, Was diagnosed right after the psychotic break. I was absolutely out of my mind for the first two-three years of my illness, Until I got my grounding back and I’ve been working to recover from this ever since."
175924434,That’s a tricky one. Maybe talk it over with your pdoc or caseworker and see what they recommend. Full time work can be very rewarding and help with maintaining a healthy routine for some people. It can over stress and burn out others.

I worried he would judge me for the mix up, but he just looked over his glasses at me and jested, “So you did an experiment, and it didn’t work out....but you lived through it anyway.” You know I am so frustrated that I saw a rheumatologist once, a GI specialist twice and my nurse practioner five times in the four months I was sick and not one of them with all my symptoms thought to check my thyroid. It took a very, very ill patient to think of it all by myself. It is so frustrating isn’t it. The only thing I forgot to discuss with him today was the anxiety, panicky feeling I get sometimes, mostly at night. It feels awful. I read thought that it is classic with hypothyroid. Especially since mine was so severe. It says it can take up to 8 weeks or more to level out. I know it has only been about two-three weeks and I am already much be
tter. Have you had your TSH, T3 and T4 checked? Mood symptoms are often diagnosed inappropriately as depression or anxiety when it is a thyroid issue. I do know the feeling of feeling unwell and getting no answers too. It can really break you down mentally. I had my best luck through all this with the ER physician. Maybe you could try that?

175924468,Having symptoms either physical or mental can be hell. It’s a good opportunity to take good care of yourself. For some reason tea gets rid of anhedonia and makes me feel better sometimes?
175924469,"I hear voices all the time. Mostly they are friendly but it wears me down. If I think the name of an older voice they will suddenly show up! Why it works that way, I don’t know."
175924470,Hang in there. I’m 55 years old and have suffered with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. There were times when I thought I would never get better but when I talked with my doctor I was able to change meds. Be honest with your therapist he/she will be able to guide you in the right direction. Remember this to shall pass

174334253,"Stratterra looks better than Wellbutrin as it only increases dopamine/norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex and not the whole brain, meanining less psychosis and no addiction. I read that low prefrontal cortex dopamine causes negative symptoms. Not sure if that’s the case for everyone with negatives though. “In rats, atomoxetine increased prefrontal cortex catecholamine concentrations without altering dopamine levels in the striatum or nucleus accumbens” en.wikipedia.org Atomoxetine Atomoxetine, sold under the brand name Strattera, among others, is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It may be used alone or along with stimulants. Use of atomoxetine is only recommended for those who are at least six years old. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects of atomoxetine include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, feeling tired, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include angioedema, liver problems, stroke, psychosis, heart prob..."

175924480,"I never had a big problem with drugs, but I used to drink very heavily. I quit in 2013. Since then, I went from being homeless to getting an apartment, then getting a job, then getting a better job, then meeting a partner, then getting married, then buying a house, then adopting a child, then going back to school for my PhD. I don’t miss alcohol at all, compared to all those things. I haven’t had a hallucination in 3 years."
175924481,"does anyone know if cbd hemp flower carry any risk for people with psychosis, i know high thc weed does but cbd flower has like a 30:1 cbd:thc ratio and is low enough in thc thats its legal, also some research i found that cbd actually blocks the negative mental effects of thc. im making this post because ive tried cbd and it calmed me down and i feel actualy helped with anxiety but at the time i was on a med that the dose is greatly reduced by any kind of smoking because of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons so i stopped. so i think if i used it now on my new med that isnt affected maybe i could stop taking klonopin, it seems to be only good things said about it and i cant find anything that says it has any bad effects of mental illness, just wondering what you all think"

175924488,how much is it the medication thats doing it or is it the disease?
174334248,"On Saphris I stayed on a low calorie diet and exercised regularly and still gained 100 lbs in 6 months. It was awful. I’m like that, though not quite as extreme, with pretty much all atypicals. The older meds I don’t really have much weight gain."
175924489,I know but I was told to stop so waiting for the blood results to do anything
175924490,"If you haven't heard of her, you might want to do a search for _NAME_, she went on to be pretty successful in spite of the illness. I think in general the sooner it is treated the better your chances are. I didn't get treated for at least 4 years and did a lot of damage to my life, which I feel is the biggest obstacle now. I am not self sufficient."
175924491,"It’s interesting, but I doubt there is an across the board agreement on what ‘wisdom’ is."
175924492,"Ive spent some of what ive saved on fibre-broadband for the PC, and and external 6tb Drive. I intend to start getting back into gaming. That was my treat to myself."
175924493,"No clue. I only use 0.5mg haldol now and i forgot it for a while. I didnt notice any difference at all, but i will take it again today just to be sure and not scare my family. But i prefer not to take a maintanance med and to use haldol or a benzo prn when im fearful. Or maybe an SSRI in the last week of my period to try if it kills psychosis too (it did before). Im very much not sure, i think i will ask the nurse next week, i trust her. My psychiatrist wanted me on wellbutrin as an only med. I like the guy, but i think that is a superbad idea."
175924494,"I’m on 2.5mg haldol now. All I need is the 2mg pills to come back and to have a 6 month supply, then I’m confident I can completely ween myself off haldol (I can cut the 2mg pills into halves and quarters to cut down the dosage slowly). I don’t think there’s any excuse for cutting off this drug from people abruptly, the withdrawal is downright nasty, worse than quitting smoking."
175924495,"I’ll buy homeless food, but no cash. Donate to a dog rescue. And occasionally I’ll donate my hair"
175924496,I felt that way for a few years...then I took fish oil/omega 3 and my mind restored....I wasn’t st the mercy of my adhd or whatever it was.

175924499,I abused benzo for 2 month then stopped. No withdrawal. Now I'm really careful with how many I take. Maybe one every week to two or three weeks if I'm feeling slightly anxious at a social gathering I'll take one in the washroom like a mall or a bar or something or to sleep. I don't believe benzos should be taken every day. My mom takes an Ativan every night. I say it's bad but she won't listen. My sister takes Ativan PRN and I said that it's not a good idea because her panic attacks go away by the time that the benzo kicks in. I'm extremely conservative with benzos. Idk why.. I just know that they are dangerous. Best to get off them slowly and use rescue doses 1-2 times a week while in withdrawal.
175924500,"No one?? I had more than enough of being unhappy for 20 years, people… but one pdoc even thinks, that I tried too many meds… I went dumb also with the isolation and the loneliness… Can I get better now faster? Or it’ll take me another ten years??? I start to doubt , that efforts can make a recovery from sz, so I am left alone in this… My current doc didn’t offer more meds the last time. I am on zyprexa since 5 years and no one likes me… can I feel better just by trying it? Yeah… I dont want more meds either, none of them didnt work for ten years, that I made only this… meds for 10 years without a help… some of them made me crazier - seroquel, clopixol, leponex, abilify… with the zyprexa, I am not crippled in bed though, that’s all… You dont believe in efforts for sz either, isn’t it? My pdoc insisted on them still but idk anymore…"

I nearly crapped myself earlier from a panic attack in town, cos i had to go out and pay the credit card bill. Im sick to the teeth of feeling stressed and not being able to relax. Its worn me out. Im getting tired of it now - and im reaching my limits of coping. At least im not drinking. I just wanna relax and laugh at some stupid vine Youtube videos.

175924506,"Well, we gave the month of Belsomra 10mg a chance, didn’t do anything. 2 days I took 10mg at 8pm and another 10mg at 2am. I did that on days _PERSON_ could watch me for reactions and note any changes he saw. So me and _PERSON_ (hubby stayed home cause now he’s having a swollen hip, but couldn’t miss work as they’re short tonight staffwise) decided to try 30 days of 15mg Belsomra, which insurance is pitching a fit about cause well, that’s MercyCare insurance. But hopefully it goes thru and gets filled tonight, but it’s not like missing a night is gonna do anything cause it’s the weekend, and kids have no friends, lol. And then we decided since my GP is a dick and won’t see me before my 6 month maintenance check for A1C and triglyceride levels, we agreed that maybe adding another 0.5mg if xanax a day will help my blood pressure. So now on 1mg if xanax 2x a day. I took that extra o.5mg when I got home from appt and slept from 11:30am-2:30pm, that is the longest straight I’ve slept. S
o hopefully between the added anxiety med and upped sleeping med, i might sleep! She’s still waiting for info for the new FDA drug that’s gonna be on market end of March. She was told that Mercy is waiting for a drug rep to show up from the pharma company and give samples. She said I get dibs on samples, that way we can try med right away, lowest dose, and she’ll hold samples of all dosages for me. But at least with samples I won’t have to wait an extra 3 weeks for insurance to approve, etc. Cause they demand records for all drugs I’ve tried to be reassured that yes, all options have been exhausted. And my copay could still end up being 40% of the cost, but because I’m also disabled we’re able to fight them a bit and might be able to get a year free of lowest dose. But i’m glad we’re working on things slowly instead of what so many procs in the past did and just throw ???? at me and up the dose every 2-6 weeks, regardless of allergic reaction or bad reaction. This pdoc is awesome, and she ta
lks to me about my kids and takes their health into my health. As I told her how the district is threatening us with fines now for kids being sick and ????. But that’s a ???????? for another time."
175924507,_AT_MENTION_ . The only reason I tagged you was that I thought you’d posted that your boy is an intellectual but I think the lumosity site that I posted deals mainly in math but it does exercise the brain. He may not like math. I think lumosity offers a free trial though.

175924510,I also have palpitations at times. My holter showed some PAC's years ago. The strange thing is that I have been on a treadmill hooked up and had what I perceive as a palpitation and the EKG showed nothing. They couldn't tell me what I felt so I suppose other things could feel like them

He is a great advice given _PERSON_ - unfortunately he is the bearer of my traumas and self hatred embodied _PERSON_ - he is my logic center and helps me with useless information and memorization
175924526,Religion is both a trigger and a helpful thing with me. I need it in my life - but not too strictly or else I back off. My mom was strict religious and triggered my first delusions. So I avoid strict religion. Rather I focus on spirituality
175924527,"Yet again, for the millionth time. Having trouble with school. I feel like WastingAsparagus a bit (I mean no offence. Just relatableness). College is...great. Do I go or do I not go? What holds me back is the price even tho I get pell grants for most of my schooling cost. What holds me back next is the time it takes. But if I don’t do it now, it’ll never be done. At this point I have settled on my dream major. That’s the most I can comprehend in this decision. Not comprehend but idk. Stuff like this, like college, is a major decision and idk what to do anymore. I can’t help but listen to others. Idk. Some people around me say I should not go at all. Some say go. The HES would take forever to do just cuz their classes are a full 16 weeks compared to other online college campuses. It’s either Asu or HES. If it’s about cost and time then it’s Asu. If it’s about quality, it’s HES."
175924528,It’s a tough cop. It really is. There’s no easy avenues and for most it continues and getting better is an issue because even years later your getting symptoms. It does get easier I think and if your young enough then better treatments will come online. When I first joined this website in 1999 there were people who lived in institutions. Their mailing address was the mental wards. I started playing cricket with guys in 1996 and we played games near an old mental ward. They still had memories of the “crazies” watching cricket from the fences… We’ve moved a long ways since then and it’ll get better. Meds are a big industry and worth heaps. You’ll get better treatments but you’ll probably find they are side effects of other research. Alzheimers and other old age disorders are a big deal so money will pour into that research. We may get a break from that. We are damaged souls for sure but that doesn’t define us. Our lives do that.

175924572,"Background time > my father was an abusive one : mentally, physically, and verbally. He also was an alcoholic and done drugs. I knew of marijuana, recently been told he was popping pain pills. He used to do cocaine. I don't know much history on him and extremely little info on his side of his family b/c his parents passed before I was born and never met any of his other children. Any ways, he passed away when I was 12 years old. about 1.5 months ago, I had a major mental breakdown. That was on a Thursday. I went to visit my brother who lives an hour or so away from me on a Sunday. He told me prior to my dad's passing, I was not so emotional and/or angry. He told me I was mainly one happy camper. I noticed my mood change almost instantly after my dad passed away. I was so flipping angry. I would throw anything in front of me at my mom and tell her I would not go home (stayed the night at friend's place A LOT). Because my mom was in an abusive relationship for 12+ years, she let me get away with anyt
hing. She never really disciplined me, it used to be my dad with his belt hits and other means... although my brother got the short end of the stick on those :'( When I was 15y.o I'd get some nasty migraines (still do til this day). My mom took some action and took me to the doctors. The doc did no tests and told me I just suffer from them and I should just take otc meds for it. At 16y.o my mom took me to see another doctor to help with my mood swings. At first he kept saying I needed no meds, but I needed to be more active i.e. Kayak, Swim, Rowing, any kind of sport to keep me going. My mom was a single mom at the time and had no time nor money for that. Then that same doc prescribed a anti-depression. I don't remember which one. What I do remember, though, was that I had a mental breakdown and tried to suffocate myself. I think subconsciously, I knew I wouldn't follow through. But it still happened and I blamed that on the meds. So i stopped taking them. I take pride that I have never hit any one!!! BUT, wh
en I am extremely down AND mad at myself I have hit my head on what ever is around. I used to pull my hair quite a bit. I do hit my hand on counters ans walls. One time I smacked one hand on a washer three times as hard as I could and bruised two fingers. That was two years ago. I never want to do that again. I much prefer to be in physical pain rather than mental pain any day. I don't know why but I felt compelled to tell you all this..... MainerMike >> For the past 6years, I have thought about suicide more than I can count. Thankfully I physically cannot. I do not like death one bit.

174334280,It’s long been associated that an event in uturo like a virus may be a causal factor to sz developing. I think just based on data on winter births and prevalence of flu in certain seasons. My understanding is it hits a genetic trigger. Something like chicken pox can come back as shingles and that can be pretty serious. I got chicken pox when I was an adult and it wasn’t easy to deal with. Our meds work on dopamine systems. Not viral ones. I don’t think there’s anything other than the possible trigger in your theorem. Virus are pretty interesting entities for sure but not everyone has that problem…and thus…why do we basically appear as 1 % across cultures…If it was as simple as a virus we’d be much more prevalent. If it hits a genetic trigger…which could happen why the 1 %?

I also had a psychologist entertain the idea of acute stress disorder. Not sure why the government would stage a fake alien abduction scenario on me while studying at college unless it was real aliens. This was back in 2011 and I had no knowledge of this until about 2015. In 2016, I saw a small fleet of these guys (same type of craft) over my house and they electronically attacked me which resulted in a 5150’d. They got into my head. They said I helped design them I think. I have vague memories of building the UFOs. But maybe I went to space or some ????. I’m watching TV shows about why the government abducts its own people and it’s: to instill fear, to exchange technology for human beings, and to experiment on them. I guess that’s why. I don’t know. I always assumed it was something I did wrong because I remember the police coming in
to my room while I was smoking pot back in 2011 but I’m not so sure…it could have been a different life. Where’s the outcry and proof you say? They must have been some Men in Black type guys I guess… See I remember being told on the telephone in a past life they put in me Monarch project. Then I remember being convinced and compelled that I was in the Montauk Project. It all started with a hunch and a feeling that things were not right and things were off like MK-Ultra or something sinister but not all too bad. Like MK-Ultra IS bad but what I went through was worse. Furthermore, I also remember them telling me about the SSP and that they could take me to Mars and the Moon. I don’t know if this all comes from dreams or past life recollections or my missing time. I’ve time traveled and met Illuminati people and aliens too in my past lives. I’ve even been a Super Soldier. I guess they’re all parallel universes and different dimensions. I’m guessing it’s all alien stuff mostly because we still 
can’t figure out how to get back to the moon or go to mars… I figure we live in a simulation but who created it? God?"

Right in the middle of all these wooden pallets was a tank filled with propane, with all these pools of oily solvent around it. Talk about a fire hazard. It was on the edge of a neighborhood filled with dry, wood frame houses. At the time I interpreted it as being deliberate. I thought someone had put it there knowing I would head that direction when I got out of jail. I told the fire department about this hazard, but they didn’t do anything. It is probably still there.

175924703,"I guess I have had several good psychiatrists over the years. But when I needed to change, I was disheartened by what I found. I was unable on several attempts to find a good psychiatrist on the internet. They either got very bad reviews, did not treat sz, were too far away, did not take my insurance, or required that I change my social worker. I thought no one cared about sz. Today I found a new psychiatrist and he is great. This has renewed my faith in good people."

175924707,"It is recommended that LAMICTAL not be restarted in patients who discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If the decision is made to restart a patient who has discontinued LAMICTAL, the need to restart with the initial dosing recommendations should be assessed. The greater the interval of time since the previous dose, the greater consideration should be given to restarting with the initial dosing recommendations. If a patient has discontinued lamotrigine for a period of more than 5 half-lives, it is recommended that initial dosing recommendations and guidelines be followed.

175924712,"I would put it in obsessive-compulsive category myself, more than odd beliefs, even though strictly speaking, they are odd. But they all stem from one specific anxiety, which is helped by rituals. I have read similar things in the literature about it, in relation to schizotype personality, although not the intrusive thought proper. So I can't tell for sure. What I can tell for sure, it would fit well with OCD. But the move from ""possible"" to ""actually happened"", that could fit. So maybe a mix of both. So its a reluctant maybe. yes. What is part of the culture, or the zeitgeist of the time by the civil society. But this gets encoded in an unconscious part of the brain, so people are unaware of it for the most part, especially in themselves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/_PERSON_(psychology) Its like having a sieve with bigger holes, or more holes. I don't think so. Its different. It has nothing to do with hormones. If it does, it is very indirect. It short-circuits the grooming, but does not rep
lace it. But that has more to do with anxiety, not the filter I was talking about. So yes, someone can be over stimulated and get psychotic, but it is different than the actual odd beliefs which are part of the personality, although the result might be similar in kind, but not in degree. Basically, anti-psychotics are tranquilizers. They work best when they stick to the filters. If they don't, they get complaints and boycotts. People want to be told what they already know, or they ""secret"" needs fulfilled and articulated. Yes. Of they will just ask about aliens, and get a ""yes"" as a confirmation or their desired outcome. No, I meant the first one. The psychiatrist is the embodiement of the filter, the filter made flesh, and he or she represents the moral order and normality. He would fail if he wasn't, although I am sure some think themselves as open-minded and would try such a feat, to no avail most likely. Its just not something they are trained to do, and in fact are trained not to do. Yes, that happen
s. But it comes from the Enlightenment originally and the idea of Man, so humanism and the rights of man. I happen to be reading on the subject at the moment.The current forces of darkness are a particular brand of dangerous though for this. As soon as man defined himself as a sovereign individual, the first thing he did was censure himself, so it is history repeating itself. It comes with political emancipation, or is a result of it. So democracy creates that. Right. It is especially bad when they are negative. Yes, those are issues. But without the filter, it is pretty much impossible, so it is catch 22. You are bound to stumble at some point, and you won't even realize it until years later and lots of introspection and spying on others and their cultish practices. I know. It can be physical as well. Once I wanted to ask someone something out of the routine, like a piece of meat, and the sounds would not come out, and the ideas jumbled. I was able to get it though, because polar bears are apex predators, an
d always get the meat. Its intelligence, not everybody has it. Maybe a lack of filter as well. Seals, sometimes a cow if available. Salmon in the season, before they breed. Fresh from hunting, you never know what the animals died from otherwise. Life itself. It can be those things and more. I think in the present context, it was those two things, mostly ideas, but ideas form connections, especially ideas of emotions, it is what connects, but the idealization of the emotion disconnects, so another catch 22. Its ever changing, although I tried in the last few years to stick with some concepts, to create an identity of sort, that can be shared, perhaps in the hope of getting out of the circle of the catch 22."

175924717,Yes I do its normal now. Off meds its high and on Abilify it was extremely high even painful psychologically and physically.
175924718,I’m successfully tapering down from the Depakote. I’m currently at 500mg and going down to 250mg in a couple of days. In about 12 more days I’ll be completely off my mood stabilizer. Hopefully I’ll do well. But I’m still on the 4mg of Risperdal. Something tells me that I need to be on an AP but in due time I’ll ask to go back down to 3mg once again. I sometimes struggle with taking meds but I always end up taking them.
175924719,I can’t say exactly. When I was in school I was always tired but that was because I had really bad sleeping habits (took me several hours to fall asleep so I only got 3 to 4 hours of sleep each night and was basically chronically exhausted). The timetable at uni was a lot easier on my sleeping habits so I was finally able to get enough sleep but did notice that my motivation and concentrating really suck. So basically these issues either started when I was around 18 or I’ve had them years before that but didn’t notice because I was constantly exhausted anyway and attributed any problem to that. It’s still ungoing though. What’s weird is that it’s barely noticeable to people on the outside. I’m just now finishing up my degree almost a whole year early and already found a full time job that I will be starting soon. On the outside I look like I’m productive and overachieving. In reality though I have to force myself to keep going because I know what will happen if I stop. If I’m not i
n constant overdrive I become completely lethargic and I fear once I let that happen I won’t be able to get out of it. Kinda like someone who is completely exhausted and only keeps walking because he will fall asleep if he stops.

175924728,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo
u’re just daydreaming to observers."

175924744,"Hi everyone. Ugh, I’ve been struggling the past week. Sorry in advance if this is _PERSON_. Last Monday I went to my drs office and saw someone other than my regular dr; it was for a common infection and planned to get a script and be on my way. For whatever reason, she started looking over my bloodwork and noticed my protein level was slightly elevated. She ordered a blood test that day and got results 3 days later. Of course when you do the terrible thing of looking online for causes of elevated protein levels first thing to pop up is cancer. ????? With having anxiety for so many years I should know better, I do know better but can’t help but look. So needless to say for days I was in a constant state of worry, not interested in eating or doing anything other than thinking. not to mention the stress and worry we are all already feeling from coronavirus. With all of this I’ve noticed lower back pain. I’ve had tinges if pain before but it’s gone away. This has been going on almost daily s
ince my drs appt last week. The more I think about it the worse it gets (of course). She finally called me with the blood work results and the protein that causes cancer was negative which is great, but she still wants to do some other blood work to rule anything else out. She said it’s fine to wait until all this coronavirus is over to go get it done and said not to worry or loose sleep over it. Easier said than done for someone with anxiety I know anxiety can cause body symptoms but has anyone experienced this before? Another bit of important information would be that I’ve been working from home and spending a lot of time laying around watching tv. Looking online this shows it’s not helpful for back pain to lay or sit around a lot. Sorry in advance for the long post but could really use some reassurance and help right now ?? thank you so much everyone. -M"

174334293,"I recently read an interesting article (https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/celooser/files/wheatleykangparkinsonloosercompass.pdf) by _NAME_, a social psychologist from Dartmouth college, talking about a theory of what actually causes people to feel a “connection” with one another. Here’s a quote: “People seek meaning in life through the company of others. Yet, as anyone who has ever felt lonely in a crowd can attest, company alone is not enough. What people really seek is connection, the pleasurable mutual engagement between oneself and another mind… Connecting deeply with another mind is as enigmatic as it is fulfilling. Why people ‘‘click’’ with some people but not others is one of the great unsolved mysteries of science. However, researchers from psychology and neuroscience are converging on a likely physiological basis for connection – neural synchrony” The article then goes on to say that “neural synchrony” relies on being able to predict other minds: “First, we revi
ew evidence that the perceptual systems in the human brain are tuned to seek other minds and predict their behavior. Second, we suggest that the ability to dynamically predict behavior affords synchrony.” Well one of the symptoms of schizophrenia is “impaired mentalization”. (This video talks about social cognitive deficits, including impaired mentalization, in schizophrenia if you’re interested: The Human Social Brain: How It Goes Awry in Schizophrenia (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4DwtiTSkwA). And mentalization helps us to predict other people’s behavior. I used to think that I was just “awkward” or “weird”, but I prefer this explanation much better."

Not as severe as what you’ve described but enough that I feel I understand what you are going through. For the thought broadcasting, as real as it feels, just calm yourself down and remind yourself that no one can read your mind. It’s not scientifically possible. Just keep telling yourself that. I know you said you tried a bunch of medicine and it never made you feel better but there is a medication out there that will work for you most likely you just need to keep trying meds until you find it. I know the process of finding a med is long and hard, but when you find the right med it’s worth all the hard work because your symptoms go away with very little side effects. I would encourage you to try meds again for the thought broadcasting and intrusive thoughts."

174334323,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effects of 6-Week Use of Very Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes in Smokers With Serious Mental Illness. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, SE _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and EC _PERSON_, Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco , Dec 23 2019 The US Food and Drug Administration is considering implementing a reduced-nicotine standard for cigarettes. Given the high rate of smoking among people with serious mental illness (SMI), it is important to examine the responses of these smokers to very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes.This trial compared the effects of VLNC (0.4 mg nicotine/g tobacco) and normal nicotine content cigarettes (15.8 mg/g) over a 6-week period in non-treatment-seeking smokers with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder (n = 58). Linear regression was used to examine the effects of cigarette condition on cigarettes per day, subjective re
sponses, nicotine and tobacco toxicant exposure, craving, withdrawal symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms.At week 6, participants in the VLNC condition smoked fewer cigarettes per day, had lower breath carbon monoxide levels, lower craving scores, and rated their study cigarettes lower in satisfaction, reward, enjoyment, and craving reduction than those in the normal nicotine content condition (ps < .05). Week 6 psychiatric and extrapyramidal symptoms did not differ by condition, except for scores on a measure of parkinsonism, which were lower in the VLNC condition (p < .05). There were no differences across conditions on total nicotine exposure, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, withdrawal symptoms, or responses to abstinence.These results suggest that a reduced-nicotine standard for cigarettes would reduce smoking among smokers with SMI. However, the lack of effect on total nicotine exposure indicates VLNC noncompliance, suggesting that smokers with SMI may respond to a reduced-nicotine standard 
by substituting alternative forms of nicotine.Results from this trial suggest that a reduced-nicotine standard for cigarettes would reduce smoking rates and smoke exposure in smokers with SMI, without increasing psychiatric symptoms. However, noncompliance with VLNC cigarettes was observed, suggesting that these smokers might respond to a reduced-nicotine standard by substituting alternative forms of nicotine."

Not everyone that claims something is unbearable is capable of making a life and death decision. Far from it. And I can bet everyone on this forum has had ""unbearable "" moments, yet here we are. Bearing it. Making better decisions and realizing things can get better. That’s also why places like this exist. To inform others of treatment options. To educate. To inspire.

I’ve also heard that there are very rare cases of MS that are not diagnosed because they’re too rare and don’t have enough of the characteristics of MS.

175925132,"So in other news, I'm finally going to build that second giant bird cage I bought for the birds. It's been sitting in a giant box in my bedroom for god knows how long. The birds have four cages, though they roam freely. There's the first big cage, which has all the essentials in it. Food, water, toys, perches of all shapes, sizes and materials, plus a bird bath bowl hanging off the side of it. Then there's _PERSON_ cage. He's my lovebird, who I rescued, kind of. He and a female lovebird were rescued by a family member of their original abusive and neglectful owner. They were dropped off at a pet shop, where I got them for free. Sadly, the other lovebird didn't make it. They were both in pretty rough shape, and he's doing tremendously better, physically, but he's still not in good mental health, and he may never be. Because of that, he has his own cage, with his favorite toys (he loves bells), his carrot slices and blueberries, and his own wooden plank perch. The other birds will walk on top of it, 
and there's a bridge/ladder attaching it to the big cage, because he can't fly because of the abuse he suffered, and he's able to climb from the floor to the very top of the big cage. His cage sits on a stand. The other birds respect him. I've always said birds are the smartest pets any human could ever own. They're proven to be smart animals naturally, but they pick up on things, eve amongst themselves. _NAME_ doesn't attack the other birds, and he never has. The other lovebird did at first, but _NAME_ never did. _NAME_ also has a breathing problem, which the vet said he'll have for the rest of his life, but will not kill him. Birds breathe through their nostrils. If they breathe through their mouths, it's either because they're scared (usually if an unexperienced owner tries to force the bird to love them the very first day they're in their now) or if they're sick. _NAME_ still breathes through his nostrils, but it sounds like he has a nasty head cold. He's a cool bird, and an absolutely beautiful one too, 
but he doesn't trust me. I don't know if he'll ever trust another human, but he loves the other birds. He wasn't too shaken up when the other lovebird died. I thought he would be, but I was there, changing their food, when the other lovebird just plummeted off the perch, slammed into the bottom of the cage and was dead. That was the last time I cried. My other birds knew I was hurting, and they came to comfort me. As for the other cages, there's a play cage that's loaded with all sorts of toys, a rest and relaxation cage, that has all sorts of perches in it, and the second big cage if going to be a replicate of the first big cage. I already have the food and water bowls bought. I’m going to get the perches soon. I have a lot of backup toys that I rotate out of the other cages that I’m just going to put in there so that way they have all the toys to play with. I’m debating on getting a second bird bath bowl to attach to the outside of the cage. If you would have asked me a month ago, I would have said no
, but in the past month, both the cockatiel and the one budgie started to use it to take baths. Before that, it was only _NAME_ and the two green cheek conures used it. I have a photo from the first time the cockatiel used it. I’d never tell any of them this, but the cockatiel is my favorite. I had given him baths in the sink, which he hated, but had to be done for his physical health. Now he bathes himself like a good boy. Yes yes"

Used to, I would take 0.5mg and it'd not only stop a panic attack but also knock me out for half the day. Now, I take 1mg twice a day and it does nothing to me, like I'm taking a sugar pill.

175925164,"I was diagnosed with severe depression at 15. Panic and anxiety disorder around the same time. About a year ago, I kept returning to my psychiatrist, telling her “I think I’m bipolar.” I explained my mind-I’m driving down the road, jamming to music, then I think of hitting a telephone pole. I’m enjoying the sunshine and all of a sudden, I’m thinking about how to die. How to make it easy, relatively painless. She kept insisting I was not bipolar because of ONE missing symptom- not sleeping for days. Finally, she agreed to start me on a bipolar medicine. It has been the most efficient yet. And so, the diagnosis followed. Tonight I am frustrated. I’m on a “high.” It’s midnight, I’m full of energy and hope. I want to steam clean the carpets and scrub the baseboards to prep for painting this summer. I want to organize the closet. My spouse and I plan to move within the next few years, and I’m already planning the layout of our home in Texas. And I’m frustrated because I know wh
at is to come, most likely tomorrow. Tomorrow will bring a storm of sadness. It will bring relentless tears and horrifying thoughts. It will bring exhaustion and restlessness. I’m stuck on this _USER_ID_, and I’m afraid of heights (so to speak). I have tests tomorrow, for a medical problem going on for 6 months. 6 months of excruciating pain, surgery, a cancer diagnosis, being cleared of cancer, more tests. Still, they cannot figure out the source of this pain. To say I am frustrated is putting it nicely. I’m in college and I have no motivation to keep pushing forward. I’m uncomfortable 24/7. But I will. I have an angel watching over me, the most amazing, sweet man I’d ever dreamed of. I have my chapter two love, pushing me to follow my dreams and supporting me in any way he can. I have a career I’m going into to help people like me. Take the high. Fight through the low. Allow yourself to feel. Recognize each emotion as it rolls in like thunder. Sit with it for a while. Shower. Wash your face. Dee

175925169,"That’s a fair point. I actually felt that way (even though I wasn’t cured) after about 6 years on medication when I started doing well. It was like I felt as if I was expected to just join back in to normal life as if nothing had happened, which wasn’t possible. It makes things hard. On the flip side though, I think there for some of us, there are parts of our personality (for lack of a better term) that we are aware of that is lacking, and that the focus along with the ‘magic pill’ will make us catch up faster that we otherwise would. Also, an increased ability to deal with stress means we can take on more growth than with sz."

174334423,"When I was first diagnosed I was told by the psychiatrist that the lower doses of anti-psychotics are better for long-term prognosis.

She’s afraid she won’t take the medicine if she weren’t on the injections. I’m told that people with schizophrenia need injections to maintain. I’m taking 25 mgs of Strattera now to counteract the effects it feels and to boost my energy. It’s working really well, but it is causing mild hallucinations at night. I’m frustrated. I tried to tell my psychiatrist over the phone I want to switch to anti-psychotic pills at a lower dose. You know what he did? COMPLETELY IGNORED ME. He didn’t even answer. He pretended I didn’t ask it or say anything about it. The other side effect of Abilify/Aristada at high doses are vision changes so severe i feel I am going blind and severe weigh

Honestly, what’s helping me besides APs (abilify and decreasing risperidone) is a natural treatment that _PERSON_ used with his patients and said to cure 90% of them. It consists simply of Niacin (vitamin B3) and Vitamin C. The initial dose would be 3 grams of niacin and usually the equivalent of vit C. Since I started taking these vitamins (+ vit D and omega 3) I haven’t gone to the hospital and I’m thinking clear. It has been two years and I plan to take niacin forever. My lack of motivation is still there but it’s gotten better with the decrease in risperdal. I will continue taking abilify, probably forever as well."

174334425,"I was in need of a dopamine enhancer, due to my neural activity being below normal. The dopamine enhancer they gave me is what triggered the schizophrenia symptoms. All this happened about 24 years ago. So there was no way that I could take a dopamine suppressing schizophrenia drug, since that turned me into no more than a zombie. But when I went on the Zoloft med, holy cow, it doubled my intellect, enhanced my color vision and the sense of taste, among dramatically improving other things as well. Sadly, over time, its effectiveness faded. So the doc would take me off the drug for a while and then try again. But each time, the effectiveness was less and less, until it had no effect at all. It was similar to the effects you see of L-dopa in the movie called Awakenings, starring _NAME_ and _NAME_. When I think back about the movie, I keep recalling seeing _NAME_ as the _NAME_ character, standing in front of a fan and smiling as he could for the first time in decades feel the air touch his face once a
gain. Take everything away for a while and then, when it comes back, it seems 100 times better than before. What everyone else takes for granted day after day, you now see as 100% of its true value. In the movie you also see one guy who is extremely interested in one of the tires on a buss, and the nurse clearly does not understand what is going on. She can not comprehend what it is that he is now seeing. To her, it’s just a tire. To him, it is so much more.

Please do read it. Fractals are what this is about, THIS IS NOT LOGIC 10 - 18 - 64, 64-18 = 46 10 - 18, 46 64 64-46= 18 weird coincidence lets try some more 10 18+18, _PHONE_NO_ 64 , 10 26 10 18(because 46 - 36 = 10) 10 18 = 180 / 14.04 = 12.82 26 10 = 260 / 13.10 = 19.85 19.85- 12.82 = 7.027 , - 0.02 = 7.007 0.02*13.18 = 0.2636 means 26 36 insert _PHONE_NO_ 64 = 36 36 36 46 64= 36 36 36 110 = 108 -110 = 2 means 0.02 DID I just have a ZEN moment."
175925273,"I feel like I'm in psychosis. I'm gonna take 5mg of olanzepine, try to sleep and start a new day. I thought of taking Vyvanse and phenibut to stay up all night but bad idea"
175925274,Great painting. Good job.
175925275,"I am contemplating of switching my taking medication form to injecting.Should I take antipsychotic via injecting or oral,which is better?"
175925276,Pretty much everyone I know knows I have it now. They still talk to me but understand when I want to be left alone. It used to just be two friends.

175925278,good luck hope you find new work
175925279,Here in Oklahoma I got a lot of help I didn’t want. It’s okay now. Right now I live in an assisted living center for the mentally ill. I’m very grateful for the help I got now. If I wasn’t on med’s I would be that crazy homeless guy standing on the corner raving about space aliens. In my case I’m being well taken care of.

175925282,I am very envious of your healthcare system. I can’t tell you how many times I have had to wait days to get treatment for severe ailments because I couldn’t afford the emergency room. Cost me 2 ??????? grand every time I go.
174334432,doc checked my clozaril levels and they are within range. other than that im tired. how are yall.
174334431,"It’s a true story Possible trigger: I met this girl that had the same first name as me on a different schizophrenia forum website back in like 2014 or so. She was talking to a 40 or 50 year old guy who lived in like _NAME_ or Missouri or something and she was in _NAME_ at the time. She traveled up to see him in Missouri in a _NAME_ she bought cheaply. I thought this was all a joke. She ended up moving in with him in a cabin he lived in in the woods of Missouri or Arkansas or one of those places. She told me one night he didn’t take his meds and chased her out of the house at night with a knife, into the woods. She called the police and all that. Then he was in jail and she bailed him out and they went back to living together. One day she ghosted me. Never heard from her again. She was a sui person and wanted that or state hospital. She was 20. He was like mid 40s or 50s. I’m trying to find them online. When I heard about the incident it was on the news. They both had paranoid schizophrenia."
175925283,"Do you like _USER_ID_? He’s a member of The Glitch Mob, but he also makes his own stuff. I really like his music."

174334438,"they say half of schizos have an anxiety disorder too. i wonder how often their anxiety is better classified as its own disorder, or as an underlying symptom of the psychosis disorder."
175925286,Same here. I took medication. I also had stomach issues growing up. It was constant.
175925287,It’s sometimes just in the language. You wouldn’t know it _AT_MENTION_ .
175925288,Doing well
175925289,Sounds like my father.I don’t have supportive mother anymore.
175925290,"i have some deep delusions that just seem unprobable that it is really that way. I keep hearing new voices that have never seen me but its like they are just passing by and see me. First they are like who is that then they get closer and dont like me, sometimes they like me for a little while but they usually turn bad and say im a demon. They watch me take a shower and go to bathroom. Now im trying to be rational and say is in the spirit realm really random people that can eves drop on any life, Like where are these voices are they in heaven looking at people on earth, or some other dimension where they can see us but we cant see them. Like how can they go about living their life in the spirit realm and at the same time see me on earth. It doesnt even make sense and seems impossible. I try to think rational and it just doesnt seem like in reality it would be that way. Some random spirit walking or what ever who can see earth people and everything they are doing. I cant stop from hearing the voices 
but i can choose to believe what i am believing is just not rational and most probable just a delusion that isnt really real. Usually id talk to them in my head and try to reason with them, but am i trying to reason with something that is not even there. So i think the best thing to do is just try to ignor it the best i can and dont believe the delusion. Although i am experiencing that random spirits who dont know me or just discovered me the rational side to me wonders if it even makes sense and is ludicris. What am i believing…im tired its stupid"
175925291,"I also have a bunch of things I’ve been misdiagnosed with, I mean I have symptoms of those disorders, I have symptoms of a lot of disorders and it sucks but at least not enough to meet criteria for most. Autism sza ocd and cptsd."
174334435,"No, autism and schizophrenia are not caused by viruses. Imagine they were caused by a virus. They would spread from person to person and you would have clusters of schizophrenics (or autists) - this has never happened yet. Instead schizophrenics are uniformly distributed across different countries and cultures. The best we know so far is that there is a genetic predisposition and an epigenetic (environmental) set of triggers."
175925292,"My dad let some people come over to our house today who had been exposed to coronavirus and we have a 1 week old baby living here so my sister in law said that no one can see there baby for 2 weeks because the people my dad invited over were just hanging out so now she's worried that we could get it and give it to her baby. So then my mom was really upset that she won't be able to see her grandchild for two weeks and they got in a fight because he's the one who let the people come over knowing that they had been exposed to the coronavirus (they usually don't fight because my mom doesn't like confrontation) and she ended up saying ""well why don't I just go get coronavirus and die"" and he said, ""I can find some for you."" I literally wanted to punch him in the face. Now I don't know what to do. I'm so overwhelmed. I have really bad OCD and anxiety in general and I can't take it anymore. Now my mom is just really upset but she's still just sitting there in her room with my dad and I hate him and I 
feel bad for her and I'm so stressed and I havent eaten or drunk anything for a day and a half."
175925293,_AT_MENTION_ do u know if the meds help homicidal thoughts or not _AT_MENTION_
175925294,I’m feeling very anxious about the world forever changing
175925295,_AT_MENTION_ I hope and think you shall be ok it is only one dose. It normally takes 2 dose to really mess one up on those two meds from what I have read.
175925296,What did you go on to?
175925297,question if your girl are attracted to the opposite sex or same sex. if you dont want to answer its okay. i know its kind of personal.
175925298,I was so deficient in vitamin D at one point that I had to take prescription vitamin D to get back to normal. I made a point to go outside way more often after that (and I take vitamins regularly now). Lol.

175925301,"You find my thinking is improving by my posts? Tbh, I really try now to become more rational, but my body is fighting against this too… I try to get more ‘‘alive’’ in fact, but its fighting with my illness too this… Maybe I feel my brain like this, cause I lived too much in my head for loong… I find this a reason tbh… It can happen, isn’t it? Idk for the inflammation… I had such a terrible past with my family, that it can be traumas too… So, what do you advice me, to keep going? This brain can be relieved too? I walk with the pupils wide because of it, it makes me crazy… anyway, I guess I have no choice… Ill keep going with this painful feeling of my brain in the head… Maybe I can get better on this with time?"
175925302,Yeah problems are hard to discuss and having sz is a major problem in itself.
175925303,I haven’t noticed autism in you
175925304,They seem pretty average to me. I’ll get the same kind of disorganized intrusive thinking from time to time.

175925309,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ your replies came long after my post but I still appreciate it. I’m doing much better now. Had a relapse in October to November but from December things ok again. Feeling relatively stable. Alien comes on occasion but not bothering me much at moment. Depression at bay. Only thing I have had to deal with now is my anger problem which negatively affecting my marriage. Had pms recently which stressed us both out. Trying to work on my temper. Is a bad temper linked to sza do you think? Or is it just my personality?
175925310,I don’t know about 20 years to be exact but yes the meds were on shave off a bunch of years to our lives.
175925311,"_PERSON_ used to think that But I’m guessing everyone is just thinking the same thing, that’s why they told me harsh crap or treated me bad. Only to protect themselves."

175925313,"I haven’t found any cameras, but I have this deep belief"
175925314,I mean I don’t know about high blood pressure effecting the brain but I do know that stress raises your blood pressure. If you want to take care of higher blood pressure I would recommend eating healthy and exercising as much as you can. I’m sure you already know this.
175925315,Please see a psych doctor and be open with them so they can prescribe some medication for you or change to a different med if you current ones aren’t working. I’m concerned for you and want you to get help.
175925316,So I read the first five pages of the first chapter for a third time today and took some notes. It is amazing how much more you glean from rereading complex material.

175925321,"These are all delusions and common. Being followed and targeted is seen all over this forum. You see men and assume they are after you. No, anyone following you wouldn’t be that stupid to be seen. The xamera thing is also common. How ofteb do you see people saying they tore apart things because there were cameras inside? A lot. Ask any military man or woman. They are trained to never be noticed."

175925330,_NAME_’s wort can cause hallucinations and really bad headaches …if you take too much of it. Talking from experience…I didn’t want to take medication so I tried it.

I’m not a biology fan or nerd, but have you heard of micro-tubules? en.wikipedia.org Quantum mind The quantum mind or quantum consciousness is a group of hypotheses which proposes that classical mechanics cannot explain consciousness.

175925339,"The Doctors have consistently said no more than two APs, and the full dose must be taken once a day. But with some arm twisting, I was able to get 3 APs, and they are taken throughout the day to increase effectiveness. Taking Zyprexa, Letuda and Seroquel. Seroquel helps with the depression and anxiety. Zyprexa helps with the paranoia, but it has a max of 30mg, and it’s just too weak to do a lot of good. Letuda adds to the Zyprexa and Seroquel effects. The worse issue is more APs mean more side effects."

I find this list to be super helpful. :) Personally, I try to meditate for 10-20 minutes a day. I focus on what I love, or what I am grateful for during that time. I used to be a non-believer, but it really does help. No distractions - no phone, social, TV or anything like that. Sometimes, my meditation is taking a walk in nature. You can create a practice that works for you, that is part of what is great about it. Hope this helps, _NAME_"

I scraped ice off the sidewalks but it just keeps snowing and melting on the sidewalk and turning into ice. It pissed me off. But I did the dishes for my mom because she's at work and I cleaned the litter box. I took 5mg olanzepine, 60mg CBD, 50mg atenolol, 0.5mg Xanax and 10mg melatonin to sleep. No heart palpitations. Then 50mg Vyvanse, vitamin D and 50mg atenolol to wake up and then took 750mg phenibut but I think I'm tolerant to 850mg phenibut so I took an extra 500mg. Tomorrow I'll take 850mg phenibut then slowly taper. I failed a few times because I needed to be social. And when I'm social on it, I'm reallly social and everyone loves me instead of me being apathetic and moody."

One option was to say, “To sleep, perchance to dream”. But that would sound like last words before I die. Anyone have anything cool, short and funny I can say before losing consciousness?"
175925351,It was so sad when _NAME_ took a job at the Marriott (we were near broke) thought he was a maintenance guy basically a cleaning boy put up a fuss. He ironed his pants shaved and went into work and they let him go.

175925360,I experimented with marijuana in high school but was never really a user. I joined the military at 17 and didn’t retire until I was 42 so I never got into drugs in my adult life. Probably would have still smoked occasionally if it weren’t for that. My illness is pretty severe but I am high functioning despite the illness.
175925361,You sound so typical in your suffering. I think we here have all been through it. Here’s hoping you make your way.
175925362,How to get them to agree to the test
174334449,Last night I tried asking them math problems I didn’t know the answer to with a calculator up. They were wrong 100% of the time. They aren’t real spirits because otherwise they would probably have supernatural knowledge and be able to do any math problem.
175925363,It’s possible the headaches were from stress-- I was unmedicated and working 40+ hours a week. But the tactile hallucinations started early on for me when I was first slipping into psychosis. It’s not uncommon for us to experience anxiety with this condition-- CBT has been very helpful personally in dealing with anxiety. This video does a nice job explaining some concepts: I hope you have a peaceful rest of your day!

My new computer is great but the keyboard and mouse are terrible. The keyboard sticks constantly so it takes me twice the time to do anything cuz I have to delete 10 zillion letters. It has done this since I got it. I contacted HP support twice and they jerked me off. Today I contact them and they tell me I have to go thru the retailer cuz they only support the tower. WTF??? Contact Staples...they tell me it’s past 14 days. I signed up for everything. I have like tech support/warranty until I f’ing die. But I gave my husband the paperwork so I didn’t lose it and now idk where tf he put it. I call him at work and the whole mf’ing maintenance dept is out of the office. They work for the state.

I came back and I must say I was a belligerent idiot when I first came back too but I’ve worked hard at being more easy going which I am in real life. It’s a great place and it holds a special place in my heart but I’m much more balanced now in life which helps my work here.

175925384,"When I was a forming being in utero, so content to stay, I knew on some level what I had signed up for and i didn’t want anything to do with that. I know why. It was one hitting and yelling fest after another. There was also the manipulative, frenetically busy silent treatment for good measure, just in case you didn’t get the message “you don’t deserve to be here” and “ you’re the cause of my suffering”. There’s more, And I’ll spare you for now. When I ask myself the question when was the first time I felt safe, I go to a time of a rebirthing experience I call the “ dance of the womb”. No big surprise to know that I slept for many many years under the covers, waking if my leg or arm stuck out and quickly jerking it back in, not want to be exposed to “out there”. As a child ( I lived with 7 attention starved beings, the two adults included) I climbed trees to escape, during the day, hoping to not be found and also to be found. Wanting to hide, yet wanting to be important 
and vital to another, not just a pain in the ass. Another question I ask myself often is what makes me feel safe, now. We’ve already established, quiet, dark spaces, and trees. Yet at 63, I’d like to be more easeful in the world...interact somewhat, being physically distant is a must for me. And what I am is lost, insecure, untrusting, lonely, and grieving. I know it’s not all of who I am....it’s just an overriding theme again for me these days. I’m looking for ways to reconnect...and work my stuff without scaring folks off ( if my shadowy self shows up, because it does.) Thanks"

It’s not your fault, nobody in high school realizes how important those days are until many years later."
175925408,"Hmmm. There was a point when I’d watch porn almost daily. Then I stopped watching it completely for about 3 years. I felt much better. I didn’t really think about it as a porn issue but I just felt more willing to go outside and didn’t feel like people would look at me and judge for that. Sometimes it felt like people would before. During that time I was off meds too. I started going to school, talking to a couple ladies who found some interest in me. Anyway, now I watch porn maybe twice a month and I’ve been trying to reduce in that as well. From what I have read online, according to some articles, too much porn can be unhealthy for the mind. I guess I just want to you to know that it is possible to reduce or even stop watching it altogether."

As an adult I committed a bad crime because I wanted revenge and as a punishment I was sent here amongst humans in order to live a bad life and live the cycle of karma and learn to live without that lady who took care of me in this universe.

This time last year they were really loud. This time of year is usually bad for me. Sept 2017 was the start of my psychosis. October 2018 was the start of them after I came out of hospital and sept 2019 I started to hear whispers. Other factors include that I had a cow that was about to calf and I was stressed out and worrying about that. Also around the same time I had actually wanted the voice to come back as I saw from one of my posts around that time. So I wonder which one of those things actually brought them back?

Most women I’ve dated back when I was dating expected me to pay for the first date, and I had to start going to coffee shops instead of restaurants to save money. I agree sexism is a problem, but there are differences between men and women (some of them cultural), and merely acknowledging those differences in itself isn’t necessarily sexist in my opinion.

They say sz is not an excuse to be lazy and be in bed. I am seriously thinking of drugging them with my Risperdal like they did to me in the past, its fair. I was working full time on Abilify, going almost daily for 2h to the gym and still had less money than now due to shopping addiction side effect. I think Abilify might be worth it as the addiction side effects gradually got worse after a year or two. They were only dangerous after 8 years. Its only after that time that I emptied my bank account and had debts. But my family said they won’t help me and pay my debts if it happens again."

I think family environment has a big impact on self esteem and personality. Abilify did destroy my self esteem though but I was strong enough to stop the Abilify. Abilify changed my personality, made me impulsive and compulsive with many addictions. So chemicals and family environment had big impacts on my self esteem."

I feel sort of bad but I do need that furniture now. The chair never sold so that’s fine. I was just getting started on unpacking stuff so that I could finally have access to my things here but I stopped that. I think it won’t be long before I move.

Trust her more. They call it ‘intimacy’ but You probably know that already.

They are a charitable not-for-profit organization that treats people with severe and persistent mental illness. You have to meet their admission criteria. It took me maybe a month to be accepted.

174334489,"Yeah, well, From the age of 17 to 19 I had about 15 different jobs. None of them lasted more than three months and I got fired from at least 7 of them. Out of all those jobs I literally never gave notice at any of them. I either got fired, walked out, or just stopped going. Cut to: age 19. I got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I didn’t work again until I was 23. But my first job after getting diagnosed I worked at for four years. And from the age of 23 to my current age of 59, I’ve had about another 14 or 15 jobs. I worked another job for four years. I’ve lasted three years at a couple more. I was a Park Ranger for two years. The rest I lasted anywhere from two days to 8 months. I’ve been at my current job for 7 years. My point is that things change and you may very well find a job that you last at. If I looked at all my jobs and the fact that I only lasted a very short time at most of them, you might predict that I couldn’t make it past 3 months. But you would obviously be wrong. 
Things change, people change, seasons change. Everything changes. And with a little luck, some hard work and maybe a little help you may very well find yourself at a job that you can tolerate the work, you can tolerate the people and you find yourself staying there for a few years. It ain’t impossible."

175925517,That’s a long time to suffer in silence. I remember when I was using meth I thought I was hiding my use from my family. I would stay away from them when under the influence usually or try to act straight when I was around them if I was using. But when I finally quit all those years later and started talking about my drug use it turns out my family knew all along. I think keeping it to yourself keeps you sick.

So I discussed with my case handler today the option of having my position cut down in hours so it was only 50% and then apply for the flex job. I am dealing with mixed feelings about this because I just applied to get more work hours and like to feel like I am contributing. I really fought to be able to get this job at 75%.

May be not much in the scheme of the world but I do ok in my little sphere! I enjoy life… You can get there too. So. It’s a disorder that affects your thinking…your thinking can be suspect to everyone else but you. If you don’t see that it becomes a problem which leads to first point…take the pills… I was diagnosed at 29. I’d lived a lifetime of odd behavior! Getting medications was an amazing thing eventually for me. I’ve done some pretty far out things and some really ordinary ones too.

Makes you afraid to do certain things and is scary. I’ve been dealing with some of the same feelings sometimes it happens when I’m anxious and I make myself believe that I can’t calm myself down so sometimes taking a step back and realizing how your feeling and just allowing yourself to take a break to connect with your own body really does help. Hope that helps and hope you feel any better times like these aren’t easy .

175925608,Hi First of all welcome back to the forum. I think that this could of been a result of high anxiety after you had been feeling emotional for a period of time. Anxiety can be the cause of a whole list of symptoms to many to list here it may also of been a side effect of the Escitalopram I would just keep an eye on things and if you continue to have problems go and see your doctor just to be on the safe side. I used to have a serious drink problem were I was drinking a lot on a daily basis basically self medicating with alcohol which was a slippery slope and I ended up in a right state. I stopped drinking completely for a good couple of years but now occasionally have a drink but only a few as it doesn’t mix well with medication so I think it’s something you need to keep an eye on and it sounds like you are aware of it. I like to use mindfulness meditation to help me relax in the evenings and find it really helps but you do have to be committed and set aside a period of time on a daily basis to re
ally have an impact so maybe something to look into. I hope you start to feel better soon keep us posted we are here for you. _PERSON_

I can find very little written about it and even less about how people deal with it, in fact next to nothing on the subject. All I have found is a description of the symptom and a review from Cambridge which talks about how the definition is not really well-defined, i.e. what people call “thought broadcasting” can actually take on different forms. For me, thought broadcasting, is seeing people respond to my thoughts in a negative and controlling way, almost as if my ego is being broadcast and reflected back at me. I feel powerless and overwhelmed by other people’s conversations that seem to refer to me indirectly and be controlling and judgmental. How do people deal with this if they experience it and how do they overcome it? Thank you."

In nanomolar concentrations, S100b is considered to be a neurotrophic factor, but in micromolar concentrations, it is thought to reflect CNS injury and inflammation. Seen as a potential biomarker in traumatic brain injury, _NAME_-analytic data from several studies report that S100b levels are significantly higher in persons with long standing schizophrenia, but also among first-episode patients compared to healthy control subjects. However, ethnic or racial differences are typically not mentioned when reporting levels of S100b. We assessed serum S100b levels in persons with schizophrenia (n?=?136) who were participants in two independent research studies

175925792,"It was right near the end of the day at work. I was making good time mopping the cafeteria so I paused to just check out the internet for a second and I saw an ad for a pizza. I was hungry and it crossed my mind to get a pizza after work, but then KFC sounded better. So it was right near my house and I stopped there and hit the drive thru. I was looking at the whole menu. I realized that fast food is not the same as when I was young. It’s neither fast nor cheap anymore. Used to be in the seventies that when you go to McDonalds or _NAME_-in-the-Box and got a hamburger and fries you walked away feeling happy and like you got a good deal. I can’t think of any place now that I feel like that. Anyways, I looked at the menu at KFC and the cheapest meal was like $6.00 for a couple pieces of chicken, a biscuit and medium drink. And I thought I might crave chicken more than I thought and looked at the list of buckets. What caught my eye was that a big bucket of chicken started at like $30.00. I kept rea
ding and another one was $40.00. Then I glanced and saw $50.00! That’s half a hundred dollars for friggen chicken at a fast food joint! Who goes out for fast food and drops half a hundred dollars? It strikes me as ludicrous. I guess the prices might be related to the COVID crisis. Anyways, I ended up getting the four pieces of chicken, biscuit, small drink and mashed potatoes for $13.00. It used to be that cheap, fast food was an American nstitution. I guess that went out with the hula hoop and the Edsel."

175925805,"It all begins with a group of people. This group is very tight such as found in could be a gang, work environment, cult, religious organization, political party, sorority/fraternity, or really any organized group or close family unit. There is a leader, usually set at a higher level then its members and some type of exclusivity such as a ritual and/or financial commitment to join. On the surface, everything is fine. But this group is different. People who try to leave or do leave the organization are ostracized, threatened, stalked, and/or tortured. The leader demands complete loyalty and any deviation from that is punished. Anyone outside of the group who criticizes the organization is treated poorly and/or threatened. So how does the group maintain its membership when outsiders are treated so badly? They use group psychological abuse. Often, it’s not obvious such as a punch to the face, name-calling, guilt-tripping, physical isolation, and neglect. Rather, it is more calculated or even secretiv
e. Sometimes the abuse is conducted within a group setting which causes the member to feel even more alone and ashamed. This idea of the individual versus a group could happen in a variety of settings. For instance, it could be a new employee entering an established team, a spouse coming into their in-law’s home, or a new believer approaching a church. Whatever the environment, the unit is pre-established with its own set of rules and standards. https://pro.psychcentral.com/exhausted-woman/2019/08/what-is-group-psychological-abuse/"

174334585,Psychiatry doesn’t have a good history when it comes to talking about and understanding homosexuality. This sounds like an artifact from when they treated it like a disease. The otherwise straight men who enjoy relations with other men in prison are probably either bisexual or just like abusing others.

174334574,"Though I’ve never been married. I accepted my disease pretty well. Insight that I was very ill from schizophrenia came soon in my life. When I was diagnosed back in 1980 at age 19, I was living in a group home called Soteria House. Soteria was a world famous, experimental home for schizophrenics. It was an alternative “treatment” for schizophrenia instead of hospitals and medication that the people who started it hoped would catch on in the psychiatric world. Instead of people going into hospitals, they put people with schizophrenia in a big house in the middle of a neighborhood and staffed it with people who had no training in the psychiatric field. The staff was picked for being friendly, accepting, open minded, intelligent and non-judgmental and their job was just to mingle with the clients and talk to them and be empathetic and just be there for us clients and support us. During semi-frequent crisis’s they would talk a person down and they listened to anything you wanted to say no matte
r how crazy or delusional and empathize and try to help. Almost any type of behavior was tolerated except no drugs or alcohol and no violence. You could run around acting crazy and saying what you want, as long as it was roughly still in societal bounds. Soteria claimed their clients had a recovery rate higher than hospitals who medicated people. They dragged out statistics to prove it but there were other prominent doctors and researchers who dragged out statistics to prove just the opposite. All this history is irrelevant at this moment. I just wanted to say that I spent a year there and it might have helped some people but it didn’t help me at all. I accepted my illness. There were no PCs back then so I knew nothing about schizophrenia; now I can research it all I want. And I do. Soteria did nothing for me, the subsequent 8 month hospitalization put me on meds but I was really not aware of any improvement for quite awhile, for years even. But it’s funny because from the very start I knew the goal was t
o recover and though no one could help me for the first 2 1/2 years of psychosis, in my own way I did things for recovery. And once I got past the 2 1/2 years of Soteria and hospitalization hurdle and moved into a therapeutic environment, recovery started in _NAME_. That was the goal: fight this thing, do what I was told to do for my recovery, co-operate and let people help me. And here’s my point: I did this for years and during my early twenties I co-operated. But I was living in this home in a nice neighborhood in an affluent city and I had my routine. I wasn’t working at first but I got a $75.00 check from SSI at the beginning of each month and I would cash my check and we lived downtown and I would always walk down the main street and buy a donut from a small eatery. I would then go to a popular ice cream shop and buy a banana split, then I would go into See’s candy and buy two caramel suckers I liked and they would give me a free sample of a piece of chocolate candy. This was my ritual that I did 
for 8 months every time I got my SSDI check. One day I was walking by myself downtown to get my donut on the crowded sidewalk and the thought hit me like a ton of bricks and I had a revelation right in public with all those people around. I knew nothing about schizophrenia but I was 24 years old and I realized that I was not going to recover from schizophrenia–ever. This whole time leading up to this I believed if I took my medication, did what I was told, saw the psychiatrist regularly, go to the groups etc, that schizophrenia would “go away” or that it would be just like any other disease and I would take my medication and I would get better and I would be cured and get on with my life. I didn’t consciously walk around all day thinking this but I just assumed this; that was my belief. But then I had that epiphany downtown and I was shaken and I realized I would not get better, and I would have this for life. I guess the weird part was that this did not throw me into any serious depression, I didn’
t freak out or tell anyone. It didn’t really change my life. And incidentally, my brain is funny because when I first heard my diagnosis years before, it did not phase me either. It surprised me for sure, but I never went through any trauma or crisis. I just took it in stride and went right back to living my life exactly the same as I was doing. But I’m just full of weird musings today. Most people think I’m full of something else but that’s a whole other story."

174334584,"It’s a good article, I agree with it premise. I know in my case I heard voices before I ever touched THC, and the THC doesn’t make my symptoms worse. I will say though that my addiction issues were due in part to the symptoms and a desire to cope, in an unhealthy manner. I know I’m not alone in being the only one who desired a buzz to handle. But that doesn’t make the illness a precursor to addiction issues on that basis alone. Plenty of folks stay sober or even blame the drugs. Good one EH!"

I still couldn't sleep. My heart would beat weirder and weirder every 20 seconds and then I'd have to toss and turn then it would go back to normal. Idk if that was all in my head. So I took 0.5mg of alprazolam and it started feeling better. I still couldn't sleep (It was 6am by this time - 6 horrible hours of complete torture) so I took 1mg and fell asleep until 12pm. I'm ****ing fed up of being tortured. I'm gonna ask my doctor to use a diazepam taper on this small dose. I had slight depersonalization before I went to bed as well.

175925945,That doesen’t sound pleasant. That hasn’t really happened to me so I don’t have much advice. Maybe try to focus more on your surroundings than the actual work? If you don’t like the work it might relieve you to do it without focusing on it.

Also, I too must use almost every ounce of effort to get out of bed in the morning (like for work or for an appointment). For me this is distressing. Aren’t there plenty of things I could be doing? Have I completely given up on life? How long must I go on like this? Every once in a while I do find enough to keep busy, but not often. In addition, I am not finding satisfaction with my work Monday through Thursday. But at least it keeps me out of bed. It is bad enough that I wish I would die. But I don’t feel like I am anywhere near suicide."

Personally I am sensitive, so one drink a day is enough for me. More than that and my mind goes a little bit crazy. Some days I just skip caffeine as well. It’s definitly worth checking out for people though if it affects the psyche negatively or not, especially for us with mental problems. I used to drink a lot of coffee out of habit and never thought twice about it. When i started thinking about it and worked out my threshhold my life got a lot better and more managable."

175926051,"Sorry in advance, I type/talk too much! I also get fairly odd changes in my mental state living around so many people… but when I am with a person, and ONLY with a person, that I feel SUPER comfortable around, it’s like all of that vanishes. Then when my mother gets home, it just shifts the tone… Perhaps it’s because both of us are kinda tired of each other, a bit? She MUST be tired of dealing with my symptoms and helping out with ALL of these many, many medical appointments, picking up meds, when she’s already SO tired, and SWAMPED with work… especially the symptoms piled on top of that… On my side, when I’m NOT suffering from many symptoms in that moment, I go up to her and try to engage her in conversation and such, and she’s still irritated about a previous moment of weirdness and STILL WORKING on her OWN stuff… Maybe our vibes are mixing up (including the neighbors, not just my mum) and we have a bunch of unconscious stuff bottled up? I know the whole “vibes” thing is k
inda New Agey… But I DO feel weirdness from the neighbors when it’s just me AND when it’s just Mom and me… Maybe something like that is going on with your father? The only thing that seems to shield me from feeling that (whether it’s vibes being exchanged OR just something going on inside my own head… still feels that way!) is being with a friend I’m very comfortable around. Of which I have ONE, and maybe a second (though he’s always working, we might hang soon), that live nearby. Even being on voice-chat with another friend I have online seems to REALLY help. Maybe having company over (if your father is okay with it) or doing some voice chat with some folks? If you play online video games, could join a guild that uses Discord for chat, some really relaxed, casual guild, and that group chat might occupy your mind? Too much typing! Anyway, maybe that will work to make you comfortable. Or music in earbuds? Seems more effective at improving my vibe than listening on speakers, especially when I’

175926059,"Those are the ones I wonder about. I don’t know if those are truly hallucinations. Yes I get delusions unfortunately. Always a little there, about people following me. Used to be horrible constant fear until the meds. Thought they were following me to the point of where there were cameras and recording devices in my home and car. Only safe place to talk was basement. I thought my office was bugged and that my friends were spies and I took them off facebook. Etc. I would call the police on cars parked. I would approach people who were sitting in cars. I would follow people around the city for following me because I was fed up. Scared one senior citizen real bad. Convinced my husband and coworker a little because I am normally logical. Wouldn’t let my son walk to school on his own because the people who follow me would take my son. At that time, Have tasted bleach in my water at hospital, husband had to bring water bottles in. Everytime I put my water bottle down it tasted like bleach. Has to tak
e them to the bathroom. No one knew about this one. I have a lot of fears about just about everything but feels real. Especially at night. We have video cameras everywhere. I have a mirror in my work out room so I can see behind me. My husband has offered to put the video monitors in there but I’m ok with the mirror right now. I mostly feel the dark presence at night. I sleep with the TV on the whole night as a distraction. Yes there are actual people who do follow me. Now and then they hack my phone and my tv, I have proof. However when I am really sick I get carried away with it. There are others but a lot to write and gets my mind rolling."

175926072,"Same but at 21, I tried to kill myself twice to prove that I am immortal God."
175926073,Your meds really should control the hallucinating. I get visuals that I can also hear and they are quite scary because they seem real to me. I can’t really tell when I am hallucinating usually but my meds control them. I would be mad otherwise. You need to get with your doctor and get an increase or try something new.

175926211,My therapist specializes in dealing with neurotic clients. Lots of anxiety and depression issues. She doesn’t have a clue about psychotic disorders. It’s frustrating but most therapists are like this.
175926212,"I think i might have been hypomanic before march, but I told my therapist that between covid, losing my job, and the race stuff, I’ve been on such a low. Like so far down low. I’d rather not even say how bad I’ve been or was. My recent poetry even speaks to how low I’ve been. Only past few days I’ve been picking up slight speed with getting things done again. Smoked a couple of cigarettes. Ugh I know. _PERSON_ and I had one of the biggest fights we’ve ever had last night and I had a cigarette. From him. I don’t have any of my own. Weirdly or surprisingly, IMO, we seem to be doing ok today. I told him things I haven’t told him about what I been dealing with since March and some things about my past. I opened up about my fear of men and specifically my fear of white men. After we fought with yelling for straight 30-45 min, we both had a cigarette and I did some post-crying. we’ve never fought like that before. Most of our “fighting” is very passive, at least on his part. I have 
a good feeling that my mental health is affecting our relationship. I mean since I told him what was in my thoughts about that, and hearing it back to myself I started to realize that it’s not just him, it’s largely me. Not only that but this is the same stuff I fought my dad over when I was living with him. I have abandonment issues, but more like because I wasn’t spent time with as a kid like barely at all. My mom actively ignored me. So when people don’t spend time with me I feel like they don’t like me/love me. That’s why I think I call people so much. On the phone. I need to know they are still there for me. That and getting upset when people don’t want to hang out. I feel _NAME_ I’m being abandoned. My dad worked 3 jobs and my mom drank all the time. It’s a good thing I didn’t move out from his house solely based on wanting to spend more time with someone. I moved out for so many reasons, mostly my personal reasons for learning how to live independently. But at this point, I need to 
address that in therapy."

175926239,_PERSON_ yes valerian works by raising melatonin but … It’s better than melatonin because i think it makes the brain produce it on its own. When you just dump a munch of melatonin in your body it’s not the same. Also if you use too much melatonin I think toucan evoke desensitized to it. Therefore id say valerian is better long term.

175926334,I think it’s the illness. I don’t think everyone would be against you at every job.
175926335,Ahaha! - if I colored my hair bright red it would also look like it’s on fire.
175926336,"We must each carry our own ass. Unless we “laugh our ass off”, in which case I’m not sure what happens."
174334672,"I'm looking up ""Astral projection"" Possible trigger: Because me, thinking anything is possible, finds that people's souls switching bodies (Like in the Netflix TV show Sense8) doesn't exist. Unless we do it with thoughts and don't realize it. The only proof leading way is that people with psychosis claim it. I'm interested in altered states of consciousness because many people have gotten great ideas from being in that state - Something they wouldn't find by looking within their sober state. A message is always portrayed which is why people like psychedelics and that's why psychedelics are good at treating depression and anxiety. This is why shamans say that western society has ""Lost their connection with spirit"" so instead we prescribe pharmaceutical drugs made in a lab. The shamans don't worship drugs (For example, 5-MeO-DMT like in western society and call it ""The God molecule"" from the toad or DMT, ""The spirit molecule"" from mixing two plants), they worship the animals and plants that c
reated the poisons. Psychosis is like a bad trip that persists (Until you take antipsychotics which desensitize serotonin receptors, the opposite of what psychedelics do) so that's why most people with schizophrenia also have depression and/or anxiety. I don't mean to scare people with my thoughts so I just put it in a trigger.."
175926337,I hope you are okay. Are they still going to let you take Geodon? I am worried about that one day. I already had one scare and had to quit cold turkey for a week. But I take the highest dose.
175926338,It varies from day to day depending on the weather. Today I walked for an hour this morning and half an hour this afternoon. If it’s pouring down I won’t go out. Whilst if it’s too hot I won’t either cause I only walk cause of the dog and sometimes it can be too hot for her in summer
175926339,"Yes, we do. The first week I was there I thought we would all help each other. I thought, “Well, we’re all in this together.” The actual reality is that most of the time it was every man for themselves."
175926340,really nice to hear you good at your job and you like doing it!
175926341,That is how I did it. I got to about 2 weeks in and just stopped buying cigarettes. Didn’t feel any withdrawals and haven’t had one since. That was over 10 years ago now. Sounds like your doing it properly. You just need to set a date and stop.
175926342,which plan you on?
175926343,Good that you found something that helps you!
175926344,Mine is losing my money and then becoming homeless.
175926345,I wish I had this. Please keep the rest of us updated as to the course’s effectiveness.
175926346,"I don’t work but I probably could handle 10-15 hours a week. Maybe more if the job was like a pizza delivery driver because it seems low key and all just driving around with food and stuff. But I know if I had to be on the clock working for a boss on a m-f 9-5, I’d get really stressed and paranoid and symptomatic and over thinking everything. In public too long sounds kind of scary to me. I could manage but it makes me uncomfortable."
175926347,"yes, Wave. I wrote a book four or five years ago. It’s no longer in print, so kind of hard to get a copy now. I didn’t market it as it should have been, because I can’t travel etc. Plus the expense. All the reviews I got on it were 5 stars. But i don’t feel like I could do that now. Thank you for your faith in me"
175926348,Doing my best to not end up in the hospital. I haven't been for 3 years and would like to not end up there over Christmas. I'm doing what I can to cope
175926349,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ . I am just worried because it is at night. But hopefully they will like the snack I brought them. Thought a lot about it for some strange reason. I said may be they will like french bread with brie and salami.
175926350,"It seemed both of them are neutral to my mood. I don’t have anger nor aggressive. But I have great difficulty to get up in the morning, although I go to bed at 11 at night. I didn’t gain more weight, nor did I lose significant amount of weight. It seems my weight is unchanged after 2 months of dual p-meds taken."
175926351,"Hello _AT_MENTION_, I find your post very interesting. I too have had beliefs about my close relationship with aliens and it goes back many years for me now. But when I was acutely psychotic my mental interactions with aliens happened every day several times a day. But after I was diagnosed and started taking anti-psychotic medication I started to develop insight that maybe I was mentally ill and maybe my memories and experiences with aliens weren’t substantiated by the real world. As years passed and as I got lots of sleep and continued taking my meds my insight grew stronger and I became firmly, not slightly convinced that my interactions with aliens were delusions. I learned that my memories about it are real but the truth about it is that it was delusional. If you continue taking your meds and get lots of sleep (if you can) the power of your insight will grow stronger and your mind will heal itself as a byproduct of its ongoing goal of seeking the truth (when healthy). Please have faith in th
e process of healing and try to control your anxiety about your situation with deep breathing and other techniques for anxiety control. Alcohol doesn’t work, I know, I’ve tried it big time and it doesn’t work it just makes you sicker for longer. What is really encouraging is that you have lots of insight and that is the mind’s most powerful tool for self healing. Just relax, sleep lots and take your anti psychotic meds every day and if things are going to improve then things will improve over time. By the way its ok to have memories about delusional thoughts or experiences because the memories are an accurate record of your past. Best of luck and everything on your journey to mental wellness."
175926352,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_, I really appreciate your responses!"
175926353,I struggle with staying awake… I think all I need is coffee or tea though
175926354,Also finally got a follow up too on that mental health streamer application I filled out like wayyy back in maybe...idk maybe February or March. They want me to go into the first round.

174334660,"I was hospitalized in 2018 for 5 months. It was the worst experience of my life… I was attacked 4 times and the staff did absolutely nothing to the people who attacked me. I was thrown into the seclusion room countless times and for no apparent reason… They would give me Zyprexa injections and I would get seizures from it. They were giving me meds that I don’t even take… A very large dose of Zyprexa, Invega, Depakote, Cogentin and several others. I’m supposed to be on Clozaril but they are giving me Zyprexa which was a med I tried in the 90’s and found it didnt work. If they had just put me on the med I’m supposed to take I would have been out in 2 weeks… But no they give me Zyprexa for 4 months… After 4 months I started yelling at my Doctor to put me on Clozaril… I was there for 5 months and I had no counseling whatsoever. It was terrible… They didnt communicate with me at all… Not even for small things like for example… I would get up at 3 AM and tell the people at the d
esk that the unite we were om was a Insomniac unit… I told them this every night for about 3 weeks… and youd think they would say “This isnt an insomniac unit.” instead they just let me tell them that it is. Or also they would lock all the bathroom doors. Every day I would yell at them about them locking the bathrooms doors… Nobody came to explain to me why they did. Instead they just let me yell about it every day. I mean come on! Everyday at breakfast I would yell at one of the nurses because I thought I was reading his mind and I heard him thinking really bad things so I yelled at him for it. Nobody came to speak to me about it. No “Why are you yelling at him?” Instead 4 hours later while I’m just walking around not doing anything they grab me and throw me in the seclusion room and shoot me up with Zyprexa. To make matters worse was that sometimes I would black out completely and I had no idea what I was doing… To the point that I somehow broke all my toes and I dont know how I did it. In 
the 30 years of having SZ I have never blanked out like that. And to top it all off I’m suffering from all the delusions and hallucinations I was having. I pretty much had no correct care at all. I mean the wrong meds and no counseling for about 5 months. So when I finally get out I’m slapped with a 2 year Conditional Discharge and put under the care of a Guardian which I found as uncalled for and insulting because I didn’t do anything that was irresponsible or negligent to end up in the Hospital… My Doctor took me off my meds… My Doctor is the one who took me off my meds… and they are punishing me for it. I am now suffering from PTSD on top of my Schizophrenia because of my experince at the Hospital… I have now been out of the hospital for a year. I’m still complaining about it… I find myself yelling at recalling scenarios of experiences at the hospital… Everyday I think about it… I find myself angry a lot because of it…and its been a year. I need to do something about this… because 
it’s starting to become a problem. I should be over this by now."

174334658,"Dear journal I am currently almost 4 months off my of invega and I am unhappy to state the fact that my life is still pathetic I am subhuman compared to the rest of the world. I wake up feeling as if I’ve been hit by a 18 _NAME_ everyday and wish that I could dream my life away because in my dreams I am content. In my dreams I can play music again. In my dreams my hormones aren’t imbalanced and I feel like a man again. In my dreams I am not drugged up and impaired. In my dreams I have creativity and an imagination. I am very tired of this life that I have been living for almost a year. Every day brings suffering and frustration. I am frustrated with the fact I can’t read a book for more than 10 minutes before loosing interest and focus. I’m frustrated with the fact I can’t feel nostalgia or create new memory’s. I’m frustrated with the fact that I can’t even cook a meal because standing in one spot drives me insane with restlessness. I’m sad but also I know my sadness is not genuin
e for I don’t experience any real emotions. My life consists of discomfort, being agitated and depression along with the occasional feeling of contentess when I manage to get rid of my symptoms for a precious moment. For a matter of fact writing this entry gives me that moment of peace. My most comfortable activity is to watch tv while pacing back and forth because that way I can stay half entertained while beating the restlessness. This experiencice has felt like the opposite of mediating and mindfulness because the moment I stop stimulating my self with something mindless is when the negitive energy takes over. This negitive energy started 11 months ago and never left. I know in my heart and in my head after talking to hundreds of people that invega is the root of my problem. I have seen at one time happy people become severely depressed, impaired and no longer full of life due to the hands of invega. I have talked to people that have lost there careers and are no longer able to work, Ive talked to simmil
ar like minded people who lost there fine _PERSON_ skills and not be able to skateboard, detail cars or play music anymore. The most common complaint that I hear from those who are on invega is the complete numbing that takes place. I have talked to mothers who no longer feel love for there children and religious folks who no longer believe in a god or believe that god has forsaken them to a hell on earth. For me if you were to ask anyone they would tell you that I used to be the most passionate person they’ve met when it comes to music. It’s because I dedicated my life to respecting my influences and spreading there beautiful music with passion and proudness to be able to hear it with the ears I heard it with. For me I didn’t loose the love for my children or my family I lost my love for music. I have had people tell me not to worry about loosing my ability to play music because I still have the gift of hearing it. But the truth is is that I don’t hear it anymore. I don’t hear the weight it has to 
offer. I don’t hear the quality of tone that a skilled musician brings to the song. The only thing I hear is my own voice telling me that I don’t feel a thing. That I’ve lost that spark in me that made my connection to music so special. So…. I don’t listen to music not actively anymore. I should say I’m no longer intimate with music. when it’s on in the background that’s fine but when it’s just me and the music all it does is make me depressed. I have a feeling that this may be the hardest time in my life. I pray to god that none of my family dies during this period because I wouldn’t be able to mourn properly. I wouldn’t be able to cry. I feel like a freak, like a psychopath without any intent to kill or harm anyone. My doctors tell me that I will return to my full self and apart of me believes them but another part of me is sure that they can’t know if I will for sure. The only possible way I can see getting my full self back completely is being drug free. And the reason I know this 
is possible is because I’ve talked to so many people who have gone off invega and slowly got everything back. There motor skills return, there ability to critical think returns, there emotions return and the other big one that people complain about is the internal dialogue which comes back but when your left without your emotions and without your thoughts then who are you really I feel like no one, I feel faceless I feel like I died 11 months ago and I’m in purgatory although I don’t think purgatory would be this bad. Will Abilify be better? From what I read yes it should be but will I get my focus back? My passion? My personality? My ability to work…? My ability to read a book and have my imagination run wild instead of suffocated with what feels like a plastic bag. These are the things Ill find out over the next year. The other thing is that what if it doesn’t bring me back to _NAME_…to me on one hand it’s just another year wasted while everyone else is living healthy lives progressing In ther
e fields while I am stuck frozen in a place where no progression happens. On the other hand it’s a step closer to finding out my diagnosis and seeing what type of life is going to be possible for me to live."

But the psychosis continued even after I’ve stopped smoking cannabis. I doubt that it’s Cannabis-induced-psychosis, for it lasted about two years, then diagnosed. It’s possible that lead me to it though"

175926378,This is amazing news!
175926379,Yay! Good news!
175926380,The way you communicate so much feeling in instruments is astounding. It really sounds like the embodiment of determination. Glad you’re feeling more motivated today. Anything we can do to help?
175926381,You want to have a better life working and that include a car. Reap the rewards of working.

175926394,"When you put that maybe they are there for a reason it makes me worry about you. There is no reason for them to be there. You’re just ill and that’s so hard to accept. I know we want to have a reason why they or other delusions or hallucinations occur because we as humans need to justify things, especially things that we can not control. For example if the voices are saying cruel things to you or telling you to hurt yourself or others there’s no reason for that, it’s just a horrible unfair illness! Scream into a pillow if you have to, but never let the voices control you!"
175926395,It’s a horrible feeling when there’s no emotions

I gotta focus again on moving as we will be moving out of the area in idk how long; short time. This was last minute as I thought we would stay here after looking at places in the summer. This is extremely stressful. 2. School is approaching and starting next week so that’s something I’ll be doing. English and a philosophy class. 3. I got car issues and I need to resolve those. Big, money issues. 4. Financial issues. Kinda really big issues but I should have my financial aid here soon. Just don’t know how much I will have just yet. 5. Dealing with my mom. It’s a nightmare, really. It’s a nightmare for her to be in this area with her new rental pr
operty. And why did she buy here? I’m not gonna be in this area forever. Maybe she thought I was, but things happen like now that we have to move. Plus other crap with her. 6. Work. I don’t have a job yet as an employee somewhere but I have a freelance job I was approved for, so will start that when work comes in. 7. My mental health still suffers since I lost my regular job in March. Severely. Idk what to do. May have to change medicines or idk I really don’t. I’d hate to go up on the medicine tho. 8. My prospective career: I’ve got like 3 or 4 projects going on with the writing career I want to have. One on Etsy, ko-fi, SoundCloud, (I will put my spoken word poetry on Spotify/Apple Music) and my blog of course but that’s not so much a project.

It was indicated that meds are not voluntary and that they would calm me down one way or another with or without cooperation.

I don't really know what to do other than just keep plugging along. It's not like I really wanted a MA degree in the first place. My true passion is writing fiction, and nobody validates that in real life. I wish someone could put together all of the thoughts I've had in the past and determine what I should do. I've always had serious doubts about school in general. I guess I could quit. School is not something that has come easily for me. Through psychosis and depression and whatever else, school has never been good to me. It's always unforgiving and demanding. That's why I always want to quit. If that could just penetrate the skulls of anyone I talk to, perhaps they would understand what I'm going through. People point to the concrete achievements I've had in my life. I don't particularly care about those. It took a lot of effort to graduate hig
h school. I feel like I don't fit in at school. I never fit in. It's still this same stupid dynamic. I have had to put forth so much effort to keep this train going. Maybe if I were a doctor and already had an MD degree or something, then I could do life the ""correct"" way. But if I quit, then people will say ""oh, you didn't finish your MA. Why?"" I want to just tell them no reason at all. Why should I have to justify this stuff? I am weird no matter what. You can't get me without weird. Anyway, I don't know what the point of this is, other than complaining."

Having your son and his family moving far away is just enough to make you feel so down....especially when you don't get out to see other people. However, let me assure you that there are reasons to keep on living! Just being over 70 is enough to make us feel sad at times,(I am 79) when we don't feel like doing the things we used to do, the hair is getting thin, and all of the other stuff that happens....but, you will find that there are folks here who will love to meet you, and to become friends. For starters, tell us a wee bit more about yourself, and let's get to know you. I assume you have physical issues which keep you at home? That is the case with many of us. I have psoriatic arthritis, and a few other things, and do not walk very well, but I manage to do a bit around the house each day, then come here and talk to my friends.

Next drop will be 100mg (50mg of morning and 50mg off night) Then another 6 weeks, repeat and stop at 400mg which is the lower dose range for Amisulpride.

I do take vitamin d prescribed once a month and am going to get my vitamin B12 injection on Thursday. Will try to eat more healthy once I’m back on track. I’m being prescribed zyprexa as an add on booster medication with my antidepressant. My pdoc said I need something to kick start me, just to get me moving and doing things. I think it should help in that aspect hopefully. She referred to a me as kick starting a dead battery:) I’ve been in a bad way these past two years in particular. I definitely need help medication wise, but also have to push myself too, like motivating myself to do things, so its 50/50. A lot of work I must do to help myself. Will definitely try some of the things you suggested. Thanks for that, appreciate it. I’m hopeful zyprexa will do the trick at 10mg. It will take few weeks or longer to kick in, so for now my pdoc ha
sn’t reduced any of my other meds. I’d say she will once she sees an improvement in me. It’s not good taking so many meds, but different psychiatrists prescribed different meds so I have to be weaned off gradually I guess. All the best and thanks for the tips on diet."

I've been depressed for like a month. I keep arguing with the ""soldiers"" in my head and struggling with not wanting to live yet being too scared to die. I feel like even my family doesn't love me. The meth house thing is getting me down as well. I don't have the strength to deal with it because I feel lifeless like my existence has no meaning and I'm just like a dog being dragged through life (Hell) by a leash. My mom was shaking a jar of green liquid and I said that it could explode but she didn't listen to me she was just like ""What's this green paint stuff"". Well apparently it's a meth lab in that room and the cops said to leave the house - But we still have to clean it. People keep trying to break in because rumor is that theres a big bag of heroin in the house. And I can't focus on my future. I'm feeling like I ju

I honestly don’t even feel like I have SZ right now thanks to my Geodon/Amlyobann/Sarcosine regime. Haven’t for months. It’s more a case of me wanting to make sure there are some positive examples of recovery kicking around for the newly diagnosed. I had none to look to when I was first DXed and that was horrible. People need hope that things can get better and that their lives DON’T have to be centered around SZ."
175926540,I think you’re more likely to get out sooner if you don’t plead insanity...the conditions might be better too. Imo people who are insane should not be at fault if it’s a first episode of psychosis or they are taking meds regularly and they stop working suddenly. This of course isn’t how the legal system is set up.
175926541,I don’t know. Views like this seem so reductive. Most people just rather believe depression could stem from physical causes to potentially avoid the root of the issue. It’s much better than getting real about it.

The question; what is the nature of the phonetic material that a person listens to in isolation from all external listeners ? For him,it is a realization process of the idea’s concept by a new audible phonetic mechanism,that it is planned and implemented by independent transmitter called hallucination “Hearing voices” in reality is a perception of the mental concept by stranger audible-phonetic mechanism In practice,it seems as a phonetic reading to the cognitive text meaning which is implicitly in the elctrochemical signal which was received by the receptors The hallucination’s pathogen has repeats the idea that you understood in the current time throughout an audible-phonetic mechanism that does not occur in 99% from the mankind The phonetic material,auditory process, perception and storage in the

Don’t get me wrong, most of them are cool but sometimes they act like dic*s. It bugs me that they act like they have to win no matter what. I don’t buy it. I have to learn my limits, how far I can go. I was vacuuming and mopping the gym today and one guy was just bugging me, he wouldn’t let up. Trying to intimidate me, just being irritating and slamming weights down loudly, one of their favorite tactics. There was one other soldier in there, working out and when the guy bugging me was acting like an as* I looked at him and I’m not entirely sure what happened, I think he thought he was being a man by acting tough but he was just embarrassing himself and I turned away to ignore his petty ass and the other soldier was watching and grinned and gave me a thumbs up. It was very satisfying. It felt good to have someone on my side. But I talked to my co-workers today

175926570,"Well, here is the update for the near 2 month mark. A lot of my symptoms have had breakthroughs, but not geodon alone has helped with this. For now, the voices are nearly non-existent with hearing them only three times in the past three days for 10 minutes each time. Before them they were becoming less and less and now if I consider them being there I can’t hear them. My derealization is slowly diminishing with day to day perception slowly becoming clearer. My delusions are somewhat fading in and out of my perception of reality. Each time I think I’m having a conversation with people in my head the next thought is an apiphany that the conversation is not real but instead my anylizqtion of what we might talk about with what history or judgment I have from them. The point of that is the delusions are becoming less. I’m still having cognitive deficits.

H _PERSON_, NE _NAME_, D Samaroo, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia bulletin, May 2020 16 Little is known regarding optimal antipsychotic doses in the acute phase of schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to employ the concept of minimum effective dose (MED) in examining efficacy and tolerability within this population. MED was identified for each antipsychotic through a previous systematic review. We then identified double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials that involved fixed-dose antipsychotic monotherapy in acute schizophrenia and compared the identified MED vs higher doses of the same oral antipsychotic. Studies were selected from a recent _NAME_-analysis examining dose-response relationship of second-generation antipsychotics and haloperidol. We extracted the data on study discontinuation, psychopathology, extrapyramidal symptoms, and treatment-emergent adverse events. For each antipsych
otic, we conducted a _NAME_-analysis to compare outcomes between MED and 2-fold MED, and MED and 3-fold MED. A total of 26 studies involving 5618 patients were included in the _NAME_-analysis. In terms of study discontinuation, significant differences were found in study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy between MED and higher doses, in favor of 2-fold and 3-fold MEDs. Regarding psychopathology, both 2-fold and 3-fold MEDs were superior to MED for total and positive symptom scores. As for side effects, 2-fold MED proved inferior to MED for parkinsonism scores and diarrhea, whereas 3-fold MED was inferior for akathisia, somnolence, and vomiting. Findings suggest that clinicians can dose an antipsychotic at 2-fold or 3-fold MED for patients with acute schizophrenia but should closely monitor side effects."

I too worry about bad things happening in the world and i dont think that is strange or something to deny. But if you look f.e. at beautiful aspects of nature and how it was originally created, or love and kindness between people or animals, or feelings of loving connection people feel with God and how this inspires them, i think what you believe is impossible. Sorry, im really not good at finding the right words.

I’m on my 17th day without cookies or sweets. I’m so proud of myself.

Sexual problems and prolactin aside, this is a good drug from my experience. I have been on 6 AP’s and this one works without a high propensity for diabetes, I have no movement problems like I did on Haldol, and I am not getting obese and being a complete zombie as I was with Olanzapine.

175926717,"Concerning marijuana for sleep: I got to thinking about that reply concerning marijuana for sleep, and I remembered the one time I took one swallow of alcohol while I was on an anti-depressant. It was like I was in two different worlds, one going in one direction and one going in the other. I never tried that again. So I was wondering about marijuana's affect on doctor medicine. Not good. It's like alcohol. It's like two forces going against each other. docmj.com says: Will Medical Marijuana Affect my Other Prescription Drugs? The short and simple answer is “yes!” Drugs interact with other drugs. Even foods like grapefruit can react with drugs. Natural compounds found in medical marijuana can also affect drugs. Because medical marijuana has been illegal for about 80 years, a lot of time has been wasted. Studies that could have examined this issue have been very scarce, since it has been out of the loop. On top of this, most orthodox doctors have little or no knowledge and experience in medical 
marijuana. That is why it is so important for you to include a Medical Marijuana Doctors Florida physician that has the experience to safely incorporate medical marijuana into your treatment regime. Click on this link to find out more about them: https://docmj.com/. What are drug interactions? A drug interaction is an interaction between a drug and another substance that prevents the drug from performing as expected. They are of concern, because they can reduce the desired effects or increase the adverse effects of the drugs. Interactions can be either an additive effect or a synergistic effect, where the effect is greater than the sum of the two parts. It can also be a negative effect, such as inhibition. 12"

174334736,"I think that's why I made so many friends in the psych ward. They liked talking to me and some said ""You're not schizophrenic"" lol. It's because I understood what they were saying. Things people said sounded ""crazy"" but it's like the psychiatrists don't understand. They didn't understand me and labelled me. I was kind of talking in metaphors without realizing it but who knows. Maybe just being the way we were wasn't ""normal"" and the whole reason why people are admitted is because they were a danger to themselves or others. I've met a perfectly sane drug dealer there and he was the one injecting my roommates with morphine and sneaking drugs into the ward in a mcdonalds bag. It was all madness. After I was admitted for having 20 or so different research chemicals on me, I told the psychiatrist everything. They've never seen a case like that before so they wanted to test my IQ (Of course, I didn't want to do it without the Concerta and was out of my mind after tripping. My pupils were still real
ly big) and I didn't get the results. I probably did bad. At the end, the head nurse said ""You should be a doctor or a pharmacist. I know you can do it and you'd be good at it"". When I look back at all of this, I don't know what to think. It's like what my dad would say when they were going to cut out his stage 2-3 cancer, ""I was just lying there on the operating table *Hands in the air while he's saying this*.. I thought I was gonna die.., And it was a funny thing"" cuz it was a third world country (He paid the top doctor in the country a lot of money) and they were all speaking Spanish."

This study investigated the peripheral levels of MMP-9 and its association with cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia to see the possible involvement of MMP-9 in pathophysiology of schizophrenia, especially in cognitive decline.We measured the plasma levels of MMP-9 in 257 healthy controls and 249 patients with schizophrenia, including antipsychotic drug-free patients. We also explored the possible association between plasma MMP-9 levels and cognitive performance in healthy controls and patie
nts with schizophrenia using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS- III), the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), and the _NAME_ Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT).We found that the plasma levels of MMP-9 were significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia, including antipsychotic drug-free patients, than in healthy controls. We found a significant negative association between plasma MMP-9 levels and cognitive performance in controls and patients with schizophrenia.Together, these convergent data suggest a possible biological mechanism for schizophrenia, whereby increased MMP-9 levels are associated with cognitive impairment."

175926769,Cigs are activating and a horrid drug. It acts on nicotine receptors which you have. It’s a perfect storm. Dopamine activation and not is a complex business but antipsychotics don’t affect your kidneys. It’s not all about dopamine because if it was you’d simply stop dopamine and you’d be cured. Dopamine agonists work over psychosis. It’s better technology and it’s better than what it has been. Antipsychotics don’t damage the whole system. They aren’t pouring fire on a system out of control or whatever. That is a limited and political view of just what they do and it’s rather a stupid explanation to be honest. I’ve seen old papers about the pre frontal cortex. It’s notoriously inactive in sz and nicotine is activating for that region of your brain. That would be different receptors than dopamine for sure but I’m no rocket science. Please. Don’t believe what you read off the internet from some people who have an agenda. Ap’s work well for a lot of the community.

Even if it’s not psychosis, you’re obviously having problems that need to be addressed. You shouldn’t have to live with this sort of stress. Yeah, the ER probably won’t help unless you’re in crisis (which is what they’re meant for, to be fair to them). It’s rough because you want to address your symptoms before you have a full break, so really your only options are psychiatrists. If you can’t find a psychiatrist then at the very least your should see a regular doctor and tell them what’s going on. Also you could probably find someone who’s willing to do video calls."

My dad has told me several times hes amazed that I never gave up and is very proud of me. He was sure I was just gonna end up on disability eventually and just be done with it.

A blonde lady about my age was standing next to me and I tried to be friendly so I said, “We do this in AA too.” I looked at her face and it took me a millisecond to realize I should have kept my mouth shut. She was a little embarrassed and a tiny bit shocked. That was not what you want to tell a stranger the very first time you visit their church.

175926836,"Abstract Introduction: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling illness that is associated with significant functional impairment. Although evidence-based pharmacotherapies exist, currently available medications are ineffective in some patients and may cause intolerable side effects in others. There is an urgent need for new treatments. Discussion: A growing body of basic and clinical research has showed that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a role in anxiety, fear, and repetitive behaviors. At the same time, some patients with OCD who smoke cannabis anecdotally report that it relieves their symptoms and mitigates anxiety, and several case reports describe patients whose OCD symptoms improved after they were treated with cannabinoids. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ECS could be a potential target for novel medications for OCD. In this study, we review evidence from both animal and human studies that suggests that the ECS may play a role in OCD and related disorders. 
We also describe findings from studies in which cannabinoid drugs were shown to impact symptoms of these conditions. Conclusions: An emerging body of evidence suggests that the ECS plays a role in OCD symptoms and may be a target for the development of novel medications. Further exploration of this topic through well-designed human trials is warranted. https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2018.0049"

Exactly a day later someone here on this forum was posting something about that topic exactly and it made me feel like that person was plotting to sabotage my plans. Im getting tired of the recurrent theme of someone studying me to gaslight me or maliciously anticipate what i want or fear to offset my improvements. For the past 10 years ive been under the notion that someone profiles my life and reports to newspapers or church sermons… or other propagandic outlets. Im thinking my suffering is well past its deserved duration. 10 years! Ive never committed a crime or engaged in political activities for _PERSON_ disruption or gaslighting. Petty theft is 2 to 3 years in prison. Murder is 10 to lifetime. I havent done anything. Its time for it to stop but hasnt. Have i overreacted to a mere coincidence?

working for them but i dont have the talent or skill for it.

Now I got some more of a balance with reality and non delusion but still my ego is not very strong in reality. But that could be an assistant to enlightenment. Not success. Which is fine with me. As long as I have something going for me I am content. I want to have an ego. I want to succeed. That is my ego hoping to breath.

The voice also told me not to worry about it too much, that it was an empty threat and that nothing would come of it. That was true as well. This was before I understood that I was mentally ill. This incident led me to think the voices were real longer than I otherwise might have. It felt like proof of what they were saying, sort of, and it fed my delusions. It still puzzles me, actually. How did the voice know I was going to get that letter that day? It definitely warned me before I checked the mail."

175926887,"Update Llama updates! So My case manager sent me over a list of potential Pdocs within the system. I got to go over their profiles and pick the one in my area that I liked. She focuses on Psychosis, and the associated anxiety, depression, and PTSD caused by such experiences. Goal oriented approach. Doesn’t look shady. Animal lover. I’ve already filled out the intake paperwork and am expecting a call in 2 hours. I hope this doctor works out! I was with my old first Pdoc for almost 2 years. Nervous to start over"
175926888,So - no positive impact from L-theanine for you? Or does it help after the initial depression. Do you get the depression every time you take the L-theanine - or only sometimes? How long have you been taking it?

175926892,What a good nurse!!
175926893,I fought back. I created 4 phone numbers using an app through a VPN (so no one can trace it) and I 411ed my neighbours to get their number. I call at least 5 times a day from the different number and the noises have stopped. Now well see what happens. (I dont encourage this behaviour hah)

175926894,"Were they qualitatively different for you? For me, my first psychosis was dramatic – like I was have spiritual experiences and being guided. I am wondering if something like that would happen again or if it would just be a decline into delusional thinking . . ."

175926896,Oh my. I will keep you in my thoughts!
175926897,"I mean, if he wasn’t intoxicated and had sex with you while you were, then yes, it’s definitely rape. The issue here is that I imagine he was high as well, yes? In that case, then it may not have been rape, but I wasn’t there, so I don’t know. Legally, I think you’d have some trouble because there’s no way to prove that he wasn’t high as well, and waking up in the middle of an alleyway after having blacked out with a vague memory of a strange conversation isn’t exactly proof of a crime. Do you think maybe there was any security camera footage that may paint a picture of what happened? Did you find anything on your phone that may help? Have you been to the hospital? You may want to have them check you out, get checked for STD’s, the like. I don’t really know what to do in this situation, honestly. I’m not sure what I would do. But if you were raped, know that it wasn’t your fault, no matter what. Just because you were intoxicated doesn’t mean that you’re “fair game” a
ll of a sudden. You’re still a human being with rights, including the right not to be violated. And even if, in the end, no one can prove that the rape occurred, you’ll still want to mention this to your pdoc and therapist, because it’s still a traumatic event that needs to be addressed. Actually, maybe you should call your pdoc right now? Or, in the morning, I suppose. Leave a message, maybe. I’m sorry that this is happening to you, _AT_MENTION_ . It’s unfair and, I imagine, frightening. But you’ve got people on your side, no matter what. I do hope this situation is resolved justly."
175926898,Didn’t sleep well. Kept waking up and then just stayed up after 4:30am. It’s probably cuz I stayed up til 3 two nights ago. Then slept from 10am to 12 yesterday and rested a lot after. So my schedule is all messed up. Was very upset about the decision yesterday. Like sad. I have some ideas about what to do next.
175926899,I have a bad memory in general. I have horrible working memory too. It makes working impossible.

175926916,"I gotta disagree with you. I think severe depression is higher up on the list of bad things that can happen. Between the suicidal ideation, the cutting, the hopelessness, and the feeling that I was worth nothing, I would rather be full blown psychotic the rest of my life than deal with severe depression. Sign me up for Ebola, I’d take that over severe depression. When you already feel like dying, theres not much that can be taken away from you."

174334777,"It’s on scihub! sci-hub.tw/10.1089/scd.2019.0265 Selected quotes: Early studies in this field demonstrated the remarkable ability for MGE interneurons to survive and migrate[131] and enhance inhibition[132] when transplanted into an adult brain. Therefore, the first proof?of?concept studies transplanted fetal MGE tissue into the ventral hippocampus of rodent models of schizophrenia. Using the methylazoxymethanol (MAM) model of schizophrenia, _PERSON_ demonstrated that MGE transplants into the ventral hippocampus reduce pyramidal cell firing rate in the vHipp. Further, these cells also normalize firing of dopamine cells in the downstream ventral tegmental area (VTA) and reduced amphetamine?induced locomotor activity, a behavioral test that is used as a correlate of positive symptoms[133]. Similarly, in a genetic model of hippocampal disinhibition, the Cyclin D2 knockout mouse (ccnd 2 ?/?), MGE transplants were also able to normalize hippocampal activity and dopamine cell activity in the VTA. Furth
er, amphetamine?induced locomotor activity was also normalized by MGE transplants in this model. Interestingly, _PERSON_ also found that MGE transplants improve contextual fear conditioning, one type of hippocampal?dependent cognitive function that is disrupted in SZ[134]. The primary interneuron subtypes that have been implicated in schizophrenia are parvalbumin? and somatostatin positive cells[135] and these experiments found that the majority (56%) of transplanted MGE cells mature into PV?positive interneurons while about 35% become SST?positive interneurons[136]. To better understand the role of these specific interneuron subtypes, more recent work has used a dual?reporter mouse embryonic stem cell line to grown enriched populations of PV? or SST?positive interneurons. These cells were transplanted into the vHipp of the MAM model of schizophrenia. Both PV? and SST?positive interneurons were able to decrease firing rate and increased sIPSC amplitudes in vHipp pyramidal cells. Further, both cell types reduc
ed hyperactivity in the dopamine system and attenuated deficits in dopamine?dependent cognitive function[137]. While stem cells hold the potential to help us understand and better treat neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia and autism, multiple questions remain. The first is the validity of 2D or 3D cultures for understanding complex disorders that involve multiple cell types and circuits. Both schizophrenia and autism have been associated with dysfunction of the immune system and to date, stem cell models do not include the primary immune cells of the brain, microglia. Further, epigenetic mechanisms, or non?permanent alterations to the 3D structure of DNA that causes changes in gene expression, have been implicated in both schizophrenia[149] and autism[150]. The process of reprogramming somatic cells can erase the epigenetic signature. However, newer processes reprogramming, called transdifferentiation, may be able to get around this problem As stem cells move into the clinic as potential therapies
, multiple issues will need to be addressed. First and foremost, extensive testing will be required to determine the safety of cell transplants and the duration of their effect. Although MSCs for the treatment of autism have already begun to make their way into the clinic, multiple questions still exist related to this highly controversial cell?based therapy[154]. First, MSCs are an extremely heterogeneous population of cells with no specific cell markers[155]. In addition, without targeted delivery, it is impossible to ensure that the cells will reach the target site, especially in the case of autism where there is no overt tissue injury[155]. Further, little is known about the behavior of these cells in vivo, specifically the immunologic properties of the cells. Finally, although MSCs are thought to have their beneficial effects through their ability to suppress immune signaling, promote neurogenesis and plasticity, and to release neurotrophic factors, their mechanism has not been completely elucidated. In 
addition, highly standardized and efficient protocols for growing stem cells will need to be developed. In the case of using interneurons, for example, techniques for generating a highly pure population will be necessary to prevent the possibility of tumorigenesis. Further, the process or growing human interneurons in vitro is currently in line with the time course of human development, suggesting that more efficient protocols need to be developed."

175926942,If you are not willing to see a psychologist then maybe you could study on the subject yourself. I’m sure there are tons of books on this subject that may be able to help you work through this issue on your own. That’s probably what I would do in your situation if I didn’t want to see a psychologist.
175926943,Maybe or you could just be scared because your around a bunch of strangers… it sounds like your very paranoid though I don’t get paranoid anymore on my current med Invega but when I was taking risperidone I was very paranoid all the time
175926944,thanks that’s kind of you _AT_MENTION_ I actually don’t believe in God But I just feel like maybe it’s our mental energies that will go on afterlife and what if it reverts back to that psychosis ya know? Before becoming ill I NEVER thought omg wat if I go to hell wen I die but now I do. Its unlikely in my mind but the possibility of it perhaps happening does exist in my mind sigh.
175926945,Yeah the voices to want to torture me to but it’s not the government they say its god cuz iam week and stupid and they say they can keep me alive forever and inflict unlimited amounts of pain on me I keep thinking that iam not that speacle and it’s just a delusion but they keep saying that no one would have done the things I did with their threats being so grandiose and all the coincidents they show me. But I try to ignore them and the truth is the CIA or any body for that matter cannot communicate though the mind it has to be demons or brain issues doing this so I also think god wouldn’t do this cuz why would he create something just to torture doesnt make sense

175927009,"If you often think of death and dying, and therefore stress about the afterlife this might be something depression medicine can help with. I had a lot of thoughts about dying and depression medicine fixed this. If your faith, or varying levels of faith are a point where your voices pry at your insecurities, I would try to find something that you feel very strongly about maybe a principle within your faith or beliefs, over a period of time, that you’ve consistently thought or go back to, and try to start building an infrastructure around that belief that supports your emotional state, and your ability to withstand the voices or delusions that might cause you feelings you do not like. I’m an atheist, and I do not believe in religion strongly, so my delusions come about through a scientific context and makes me question principles, that revolve around perception, the basis for how a hyper dimensional entity would influence the world, and whether or not my altered perceptions represent such an infl
uence. This also comes with a sort of physical stimulus that elevates my mood and a sense of disorientation. I don’t particularly believe my delusions after they happen, but this mood and emotional state of disturbance all but assures that I question the state of reality. I hope that even if my lack of faith doesn’t mirror your own situation, that you might find some kernel of similarity that helps you deal with your problem as I deal with mine. I’m not here to question your faith, and I don’t want to cause you more concern emotionally by making you question yours. This is a hard period for anyone, regardless of faiths."

175927042,"New Genetic Mutation Discovered in People with Schizophrenia Scientists at The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, in collaboration with Columbia University, say they have identified a gene mutation that could result in schizophrenia, a chronic brain disorder that affects nearly one percent of the world’s population. Their study “Novel ultra-rare exonic variants identified in a founder population implicate cadherins in schizophrenia,” published in Neuron , could lead to novel treatment strategies, according to the team. “The identification of rare variants associated with schizophrenia has proven challenging due to genetic heterogeneity, which is reduced in founder populations. In samples from the Ashkenazi Jewish population, we report that schizophrenia cases had a greater frequency of novel missense or loss of function (MisLoF) ultra-rare variants (URVs) compared to controls, and the MisLoF URV burden was inversely correlated with polygenic risk scores in cases,” write the invest
igators. “Characterizing 141 ‘case-only’ genes (MisLoF URVs in ?3 cases with none in controls), the cadherin gene set was associated with schizophrenia. We report a recurrent case mutation in PCDHA3 that results in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates and failure to engage in homophilic interactions on the plasma membrane in cultured cells. Modeling purifying selection, we demonstrate that deleterious URVs are greatly overrepresented in the Ashkenazi population, yielding enhanced power for association studies. Identification of the cadherin/protocadherin family as risk genes helps specify the synaptic abnormalities central to schizophrenia.” The research team, led by _NAME_, PhD, with _PERSON_ Pe_PERSON_, PhD, _NAME_, PhD, and _NAME_, PhD, of Columbia University, carried out a genetic study identifying a single letter change in the DNA code in the PCDHA3 gene that is associated with schizophrenia. The affected gene makes a type of protein called a protocadherin, which generates a cell surface “ba
rcode” required for neurons to recognize, and communicate with, other neurons. They found that the PCDHA3 variant blocks this normal protocadherin function. The discovery was made possible by the special genetic characteristics of the samples studied by _PERSON_’s team—patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers drawn from the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The Ashkenazi Jewish population represents an important population for study based on its unique history. Just a few hundred individuals who migrated to Eastern Europe less than 1,000 years ago are the ancestors of nearly 10 million Ashkenazi Jews today. This lineage, combined with a tradition of marriage within the community, has resulted in a more uniform genetic background in which to identify disease-related variants. “In addition to our primary findings regarding PCDHA3 and related genes, we were able— due to the unique characteristics of the Ashkenazi population—to replicate several prior findings in schizophrenia despite relatively 
small sample sizes,” said _PERSON_, professor in the Institute of Behavioral Science at the Feinstein Institutes. “In our study, we demonstrated this population represents a smart, cost-effective strategy for identifying disease-related genes. Our findings allow us to zero in on a novel aspect of brain development and function in our quest to develop new treatments for schizophrenia.” “_PERSON_’s research into the role of genetics in schizophrenia offers a major advance,” said _NAME_, MD, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes. “This work may open new avenues to developing therapeutics, which are sorely needed.”"

It analyzes the economic practices of various so-called archaic societies and finds that they have a common central practice centered on reciprocal exchange. In them, he finds evidence contrary to the presumptions of modern Western societies about the history and nature of exchange. He shows that early exchange systems center around the obligations to give, to receive, and, most importantly, to reciprocate."""

Ive taken medication before when I was going through a bad breakup. I dont know why i am in a ""superstate"" as you called it. I am not sure if you mean why am i feeling so emotional? I tried to find the definition but I couldnt. I guess because I have the same negative thoughts...on a negative thought loop. I think that happens because Im not funtioning well and im just recycling past garbage over and over and not monitoring my thoughts. Its easy to say but its really hard for me to break the loops some days. Some days I drive myself crazy in the loops lol.

174334813,For what it’s worth I got diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic with just delusions and negative symptoms. I was in the military and pretty much felt like I had to take my meds but I asked to stop or come off at every visit. My doctor always said no but he did dose me down until I got to the lowest dose you could take. Again I kept asking to come off and he refused. So finally about 4 years into being sick I quit taking my meds. I made it four days and I was in an ER and hallucinating like a champ. Had never hallucinated before until I quit my meds. And now I take the maximum recommended dose of one AP plus a low dose of another. Long story short things can get worse before they get any better.

Your doing nothing anyways…do some exercise. Seriously. Don’t accept poor function. You need to fight for every single thing you can with our disorder and our meds! Start now and just do it!

174334822,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Cognitive-behavioural therapy for personal recovery of patients with schizophrenia: A systematic review and _NAME_-analysis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, General psychiatry , 2019 To date, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) trials have primarily focused on clinical recovery; however, personal recovery is actually the fundamental aspect of the recovery process. The aim of this study was to summarise and synthesise the existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of CBT for personal recovery in patients with schizophrenia.This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of CBT for personal recovery in patients with schizophrenia.A systematic search of the literature in PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Embase and Web of Science (SCI) was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials reporting the impact of CBT interventions on personal recovery in patients with schizophrenia. The estimated effect sizes of the main study outcomes were calculated to estimate the 
magnitude of the treatment effects of CBT on personal recovery. We also evaluated the CBT's effect size at the end-of-treatment and long-term (follow-up) changes in some aspects of personal recovery.Twenty-five studies were included in the analysis. The effect of CBT on personal recovery was 2.27 (95% CI 0.10 to 4.45; I2=0%; p=0.04) at post-treatment and the long-term effect size was 2.62 (95% CI 0.51 to 4.47; I2=0%; p=0.02). During the post-treatment period, the pooled effect size of CBT was 0.01 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.15; I2=33.0%; p>0.05) for quality of life (QoL), 0.643 (95% CI 0.056 to 1.130; I2=30.8%; p<0.01) for psychological health-related QoL, -1.77 (95% CI -3.29 to -0.25; I2=40%; p=0.02) for hopelessness and 1.85 (95% CI 0.69 to 3.01; I2=41%; p<0.01) for self-esteem. We also summarised the effects of CBT on QoL (subscale scores not included in the evaluation of the pooled effect size), self-confidence and connectedness, and all results corresponded to positive effects. However, there was insufficient ev
idence regarding the long-term effects of CBT on personal recovery.CBT is an effective therapy with meaningful clinical effect sizes on personal recovery and some aspects of personal recovery of schizophrenia after treatment. However, the effect is relatively immediate and rapidly decreases as time progresses. Therefore, in the future, more studies should focus on the mechanism of CBT for personal recovery and the factors that influence the long-term effects of CBT.CRD_PHONE_NO_."

Was so depressed yesterday, I considered giving up. Just not sure how much longer I can do this. Just being honest. I am safe, not to worry. I would guess I have had maybe 120 major depressive episodes since birth or so. The cumulative toll of having to try to keep myself alive over the decades is getting to be more than I can do."

It didn’t support Atmos or DTS though so I went with the Sony. Still, it looked like a really cool sound bar. This is a small room I’m in, and I think it’s easy to fill a room like this so full of sound that it doesn’t really matter what direction each individual portion of sound is coming from."

Ibuprofen works pretty well but I don't know if it is safe to take it every day. I don't see my PCP until December but man my shoulder is killing me. I'm actually not sure if it is the shoulder or some muscle attached to the neck and collarbone or something. I think because I sleep on my side, plus I have scoliosis and some other bone issues. Right now I am resting my elbow on my desk and putting a pillow under my armpit to support it."

175927240,What happened?
175927241,"I am hearing voices inside my head. They are not coming from anywhere, including my head but more like thoughts or inner voice that I cannot control. I do not hear them, I cannot hold a conversation with them but they mostly talk about what I am doing or thinking on. Would this be considered hallucination?"
175927242,Mostly delusions. Had some hallucinations but not a ton. Also I had anxiety to the point where I was always scared. Like intense constant fear.
175927243,"and humans cut the grass so it shows how bad we really are. Grass genocide, Tree Genocide. Flower genocide makes me feel really bad about how we tree our mother nature I think that is the decent thing to do, they provide us and help us whether it be fruits/oxygen or even just helping the birds and insects keep safe, trees have a true dignified uncompromised purpose on this earth, humans however atm a lot of us are good but bc of sin we falter, i think we need to find a way of keeping to the good and negating from doing bad whether that is on purpose or by accident. thatt is why i truly believe that a tree or even single blade of grass is better than me in so many ways."
175927244,"It kept my delusions, depression and sleep in check for 2.5 years"

I think it’s ‘action/ reaction’ in my case. _AT_MENTION_ and I did a collab which kinda took off…and then my head got all screwed up. I’ve told my psychiatrist this. That I make an action, then connect random dots that have no business being connected…to a flawed result."

175927253,It is. We simply cannot rationalize supernatural stuff.
175927254,"So, I had an appointment with my shrink today. I am glad he listened to me and understood where I was at. I am at the point that I think about suicide all the time. But, there is no chance that I would actually do it. The suicide thoughts are more like that song you cannot get out of your head, not an actual wish or desire to act. He said I feel stuck. That is sort of true, but I told him it is more that I am not stuck, as jealous. I am jealous of my friends, family, twin sister who do not have these kind of thoughts. I feel sad. that is fine. The actual issue is the thoughts... the negative self talk that comes so much. I do the coping mechanisms I learned to challenge the negative self talk. I can do that... I just can't get the thoughts to stop. Knowing and identifying them as flawed does not do anything to get rid of them or the feelings that comes with them. But, like I said, he understood that my thoughts were not going to change to action. I am not suicidal, I just think about suicide a lot.

175927260,"I had these things and couldn’t function properly. I cut my hair weird, cut my arm several times, danced down the road, wore my pyjamas all day and talked to pictures and believed evil spirits were trying to infiltrate my mind. I don’t think that was mild."
175927261,i want to wish you well with your application. From what you are saying it sounds like you’re looking for a job to help financially rather than feeling ready (correct me if I’m wrong ). If this is the case maybe discuss other options with your pdoc?
175927262,Thank you so much Maaaaaaaaalik

175927267,"There have been only three cases thus far, and a published call for more evidence. It’s very interesting."
175927268,Then I would take the meds for 2 years. Why can’t you switch drs?
175927269,It’s very common and nothing to be ashamed of. Your dr has heard a lot worse than _NAME_ issues. It’s nothing to them. Just go ahead and tell her.
175927270,"Yes, all four units have mentally ill people. But she was not doing this a year ago, and she has control of it, it conveniently stops and starts at certain times."

174334858,As far as I know there aren’t any meds specifically designed for help w negative symptoms though if you found one that did help thats great!
175927273,I’m very proud of you _AT_MENTION_ Great job!
175927274,"I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself It's all I hear right now It's all I hear right now I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself It's all I hear right now It's all I hear right now I wanna break my vows Wanna neglect my health How can I trust people If I can't trust myself I wanna scream and shout I wanna cry and pout But I can't make myself Why can't I make myself I always seem to make the same mistakes The kinds you can't go back to fix, that start to weigh Until I'm dragging 'round a body made of clay I'm just dead weight, I'm just dead weight I wanna feel it all again to have somebody hold me in place Tell it to my bruised face that I tried But it was juvenile to think that I ever had a good thing Going with a good being So I'll go fvck myself 'Til I'm too lonely to feel Dance like a court jester Just for a film with no reel And I'll lose all of my friends When I'm no longer ideal And then get scolded again Just to come home to no meal"
175927275,"Still, I am worried about how early I will die. I want to accomplish something before I die. My disease is very cruel and in some types of it, it kills people as early as in their 30s. I’ve been told I have a good prognosis but I am not so sure."
175927276,"Eating healthy and exercise help for me. But it takes time until you feel the benefits. I’ve been slacking on eating healthy, I feel tired easily again."

175927278,"I read the textbook and did the workbook both called, The Courage to Heal, about healing from sexual abuse. I went through pure, torturous, suicidal hell for 15 years after doing that workbook. I don’t think I’d recommend it. But then again, my suicidality could very well have been due to something totally unrelated."
175927279,A lot of data entry jobs had openings when I applied through temp agencies. I got one where you just input numbers all day long. It was very low stress but it was FT and eventually the hours alone got too stressful for me.
175927280,"It’s hard to be polite when you’re stealing a friends pot plant. Oh man, she was furious but couldn’t prove it was us."
175927281,"You’re doing great just by being on here and making this post. The voices will try to be jerks. You don’t want to listen to their junk. Ignore the voices. Don’t engage with them. Try to keep your mind occupied with whatever you like(books, movies, friends, etc…) it’ll help a lot. You ignore them by focusing on something. If you ignore them, you’ll feel better. They’ll get weaker too."
175927283,Today I had eloquent voices.
174334860,"It seems I get less voices when I’m busy watching documentaries or listening to podcasts, but I need to find something to fend off the unpleasant feelings as well. More than a week ago they got very bad and my schizophrenia forced me to write a suicide note. They went away when I called my sister, but it could have been a coincidence and anyway she couldn’t come here at any time."
175927284,I think she’s a woman. I hope I’m not wrong. That would be embarrassing
174334856,My memory is pretty poor. I’m not sure that is related to clozapine. It took a few months to really feel the effects. I have visual and auditory hallucinations but mostly gone. I am really paranoid about the government but that has improved a lot. It hasn’t helped a lot on negatives which kind of sucks. I don’t have suicidal thoughts like before but I still hope I don’t live too long. I’m just not going to do anything about it.
175927285,It’s easier to say that people are fake in a matrix than take responsibility and relate to them
175927286,"Thank you for the nice reply. You said, “I hate how emotional I am, but I love how I am in general.” As for the emotional, that’s great also. There’s a quote from Great Expectations (1890) by _NAME_ that says, “We need never be ashamed of our tears.” Other quotes concerning that are: Even though the world doesn’t understand you, it needs you. It needs people like you because you give it balance, you give people hope and you remind people that it’s okay to be real, soft and vulnerable. You remind people that it’s okay to be a non-perfect human being. — _PERSON_, To The Ones Who Are Tired Of Apologizing For Their Feelings At the end of the day, you’re entitled to every one of your feelings. Don’t allow anyone to belittle you for your sensitivity. Vulnerability does not make us weak; it makes us human. — _NAME_, To Anyone Who’s Afraid Of Being Vulnerable Strength comes from your vulnerability, and being able to step outside of your pride, your protective shell, your fear an
d say, ‘I need help.’ — _NAME_, It’s Okay To Ask For Help, You Know It takes true strength to be vulnerable. It takes real strength to open up about the things that make you uncomfortable. It takes real courage to admit you’re having problems and struggling because it’s hard. Hiding your problems and pretending they aren’t eating you alive is the real weakness. — _NAME_, You’re Allowed To Have Moments Of Weakness You said, “Just think, you wouldn't be who you are if it wasn't for all those (crappy) experiences. I have to think like that. I wouldn't be me without going though what I did. I hate how emotional I am, but I love how I am in general.” Along that line we have: Perfect purity is possible if you turn your life into a line of poetry written with a splash of blood. — _PERSON_, Runaway Horses: The Sea of _PERSON_ “And as the ax bites into the wood, be comforted in the fact that the ache in your heart and the confusion in your soul means that you are still alive, still human, and 
still open to the beauty of the world, even though you have done nothing to deserve it.” – _NAME_ Happiness can't be found , wen u seek It for urself But wen u give to others , It 'll find its way back to u ...

We also have: “You can lead a horticulture, but you can’t make her think.” — _NAME_ “Just because your version of normal isn’t the same as someone else’s version doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with you."" —The Terrible Thing That Happened to Barnaby Brocket by _NAME_ “If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving one be me.” —_PERSON_, “The More Loving One” “I sing myself and celebrate myself.” —_PERSON_, Leaves of Grass All the Light We Cannot See by _NAME_ Favorite quote: ""open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.""

175927287,Yeah good. Had to go into the city this morning and sort out some stuff at the cricket club for a game on today. Got to leave early which was cool and my little brother bought my gorgeous little niece _PERSON_ down to the club. She is like 14 months…precious.
175927288,I haven't been playing any video games lately.
175927289,"Yeah, the side effects are kind of an issue. If I didn’t have to take meds I wouldn’t."
175927290,No. They just lie a lot. They do try to influence people against me.
175927291,I really don’t think children keep people in marriages. Go to a family court room and you will see how the previous loving couples absolutely hate and despise each other.
175927292,I like it. Good job!
175927293,I feel very uncomfortable with people I don’t know very well. I tend to selfisolate.
175927294,I’m waitin on a new roommate. I’m looking forward to it because there’s no one on earth who could be worse than my last one.

175927297,My parents did a lot for me. Now I’m taking care of them. But man its burning me out!
175927298,I slept like 24 hours
175927299,"Just pulled into work. Just another day in paradise. Or is that phrase used too much? I have ten minutes to sit and wind down from the commute before I go in. So sipping a soda and listening to “Stairway to Heaven”. Wait a minute! I have a weird feeling. Can’t quite figure out what it is. Wait a minute, I think I’m actually happy. Go figure."

175927301,"My voices made me very ill they could do this thing called the insanity curse which would give me very strange sensations in my head and all over. It was like my CNS went into hyperdrive and I couldn’t focus on anything else, very crippling. They saved it for special times where I needed some reminding of how bad it could get. I also felt like my heart would jump out of my chest and a heaviness in the chest some nights. They can’t kill you but they can make you feel all sorts of weird shite"
175927302,I see my pdoc today btw.
175927303,The only thing killed is the bad feelings.

175927305,"Drinking water can help if you keep it up. Besides dehydration, there is the idea that you might be punishing your thoughts or that they are dare devil thoughts that are making you tense.

175927306,"_PERSON_ is asking an awful lot. Reminds me of “I never met a man I didn’t like. But then, I never met a man.” Will _PERSON_. That’s an opposite idea."
175927307,"Big oof _USER_ID_, I’ve tried to leave pride at the door. When my pecker stopped pecking I said right well this chicken doesn’t caw, and I value my Caw Caw, so lets get thinking. Eventually it worked itself out, but I think my doctor took it seriously, and tried seeing if there were any drugs I was taking that had sexual side effects, and we worked through several until it worked itself out. I know I’m being glib, but honestly, I was just blunt, it was something medically wrong with me, and I was talking to people in charge of my medical well being. They’re absolutely the people to address this stuff to. I can’t stress this enough, medical people are people, yes they might find something we did in our predicament funny or something humorous about how something is said but thats on them to control those urges, and to be unfettered sources of help. Get the help they can offer you, because they have a means of putting things in motion that will solve your problems."

175927328,"At first blush it all sounds obvious that parent(s) with Sz would have offspring with higher chance of sz. I suppose the study is valuable here because they are digging into implications on offspring performing on a large assortment of tests like the speed processing test… All I took in was the abstract, but I feel like they are illustrating (or trying to) a ‘Sz lite’ or ‘un- full fledged sz’ and that may be a fascinating read for some."
175927329,"Thank you both for your responses! I’m hoping that ill have another long break between flare ups of this but if I don’t I might consider the Botox. I’m not sure if I’m able to take it though because the neurologists I saw when I was having daily attacks said that because of the health issues and meds I am on there was nothing else they could really do for me and sent me on my way. Left only with Tylenol and that only provides a bit of an effect. Might try someone else if it becomes an issue again. Some nausea from the pain in my neck last night but not bad. Some confusion but that’s normal for me with migraines- I mess up words, can’t find the right ones and takes me a lot longer to get thoughts across around the time of a migraine attack."

This type of employment wasn’t my first choice but rather out of convenience of being part of the workforce instead of receiving disability for doing nothing. I’d prefer to be employed doing some sort of Information Technology, Finance or desk job but sometimes you have to accept the fact that we as schizophrenics may not have the option of working at our desired or ideal employment. You may only be able to work at what’s available to you and not what your ideal work is. The requirements for the warehouse I am working at is to be able to lift 50lbs. and so I’ve gained some muscle on my arms."

Goodness knows my physical health has been steadily deteriorating largely due to the fact that I’ve become obese and have been for the past 5 years. I’d say more but 5 years ago I was losing a ton of weight while off meds. I nearly got down to 220 which might just be shy of obesity for my height. Not 100% sure about that though. Anyway, I’ve lost a total of 7 pounds in the last three months. It sure as hell isn’t much and I would have lost more except that I splurged some days like on my birthday, my sister’s bday and such. I weigh so much right now. Jeez. I never thought I’d be this fat. At least when I was thin I didn’t make fun of fat people. Hah."

174334871,"Where does positive attitude come from? It’s a part of your character, which is determined by past experience and genetics. “Intentional” actions are merely actions with a feeling/sense of will applied to them. With schizophrenia I lost the feeling of intent/will; now it feels like my body is moving on its own all the time, including writing this text. It’s not a delusional feeling, it’s a lack of feeling of intent. On a few occasions my schizophrenia has made me feel like I did something, while I actually didn’t (they were some strange things I would never do). This is how I realized that free will is merely a feeling."

Took me a long time to get that right. Went through a lot of meds and even went off effexor because I thought I could do better. Dumb move. Took me twice as much to get there again but that is life with sz. I don’t really get sad but I really don’t get too happy. It’s middle of the road but I’d take that every day over sadness!

As long as you have those things you wont have to suffer extra. You can be low income and happy. But being impoverished is horrible and causes tremendous suffering. I’m low income, but I still have a home and a family and while we can’t do anything like vacations or eating out or putting the kids in sports etc we are still happy in our marriage"

175927379,I think I have pretty strong traits of odd thinking compared to general mass. The thing about this that people in general exhibit lots of magical thinking when it comes to unknown things. How to improve this area is of course done by studying science in general terms and not in terms of tiny specifics ( and do some serious cross referencing! ). I can nowadays reason myself out of many things and solve problems where people jump on gun but funnily enough while was not the case in my early childhood with my peers. Even today some common things get me off guard where I really see my own difference when compared to others. Logical exercises like math should improve critical reasoning skills. I talk about something like learning to orient your mind in terms of set theory and stuff. When you feed connective mind with care it repairs itself via neural network sort of thinking. This of course means that you have enough cognitive capacity to do it. My general way of approaching the world is from up to bottom 
whereas for many it is bottom up. I usually refer myself as thinking backwards and in the end I can meet people in the middle. So what is actual psychotic break cognitively? Is it when when you have nothing to lean on in your cognitive tool-bag? You need to connect your mind to something and all you have is bunch of nonsense. Does your thinking style change erratically?

I do think though that there’s a stimulant out there with a nice enough effects profile that could be used to help with cognitive and negative symptoms, I just don’t think it’s been trialled yet or discovered possibly. The problem though is that a stimulant for such an application in this special group of ours is going to be a hard sell, it has to go through a lot of hurdles and I doubt there is enough profit deeming such a medication worthy of being made."

175927392,"Well, sounds like not being medicated at all would be best for that. But I don’t recommend it. I think they better the med the less you’ll feel compelled to look for codes. Healthy people don’t try to find secret codes in everything."

An overdose on either drug can have serious and even fatal ramifications, including significant organ damage or brain damage due to a lack of oxygen as both drugs suppress breathing.The amount of alcohol that can lead to an overdose is significantly reduced when one drinks alcohol with benzodiazepines, and the dose of benzodiazepine that can result in overdose is significantly reduced as a result of taking the drug with alcohol.”"

I don’t think either one of us will ever find someone else if/when one or the other passes. I told him I would hope he would try, but I am his first and only girlfriend, so he has no dating skills.

Maybe if I die because of lack of care the drs will all stop being jerks.
175927404,"That’s been debunked too and is controversial. LDL is just a liporotein that’s responsible for carrying triglycerides (fat) as energy to your cells. It has to increase for it to do so. Your liver decides how much you need. It also increases during fasting as your fat cells release triglycerides and LDL has to carry them as energy to other cells. It’s present in the atherosclerotic plaques, but doesn’t necessarily cause it. There are different new theories about atherosclerosis, and one is that the quality of LDL matters and HDL matter more. Small dense LDL particles are bad and indicative of poor metabolism, but fluffy large particles are not. Oxidized LDL is bad and it is thought that it also causes plaques. There are new blood tests that show particle counts and types. The old simple calculated numbers test is not enough to show risk anymore. Also the triglyceride to HDL ratio is a very good indicator. What’s also found in the plaque by the way are polyunsaturated fats among other thing
s that are new to our diet in large numbers. Industrial seed oils. These are to be avoided (corn, soy, safflower, grapeseed, etc.) These oils are highly unstable and oxidize easily creating highly damaging peroxides."

It’s been every day; some of it is severe like matrix theory. It was like a light switch came on and never turned off and went away. I truly hated it. I suffered. It’s been 9 years so far and I’ve been delusional every day. Nothing has helped. Caffeine makes it more amplified and weird. But deep down I still believe certain things. Some of my delusions are stupid like I thought tv shows and some movies were based on my life like tv show characters. They resonated with me. I became obsessed with ‘Lost’ and a few other shows. Some more than others of course. I have missing memories or time. I have confabulated or false memories and pseudo-amnesia I guess (all self-diagnosed). I feel like I have trauma. I often blame certain people or entities or groups but deep down inside it could have been grey aliens and possibly some reptilians. I really don’t know what 
happened to me but I am serious and convinced something happened to me. My biggest concern is going back in time like ‘Groundhog Day’. It’s an infinite loop that never stops and always repeats. The future changes but I am concerned I am not alone and things are changing, although only slightly. No one gives a rats ass anymore. I’m invisible and a nobody.

Lovemaking with the father of my unborn son was intimate and extatic. We came together and I cried on his face. I have never been that intimate with anyone else. Sex with my boyfriend is or has been extatic and best but has been worse lately for some reason. Last time we had sex I felt so distant to him and asif he was spiritually with another woman and not really with me but cheating on me in spirit? It was previously so great I was genuinely shocked . I have had so many men but most of it’s been bad for me. All boyfriends were more like friends really that I had pretty bad sex with. Sometimes it was pleasant or nice but not great at all. I want to be intimate with my boyfriend but his x wife is in the way? Or is the father of my unborn son because I never felt that close to another I don’t think. I want sacred union in sex. My boyfriend made it clear I’

Because of my trauma history, I have a tendency to interpret actions as passive aggressive shots at me, when they are really just normal behaviors. Have you talked with her about why she might be feeling angry with you? My solution for when I think someone is being passive aggressive towards me is to entirely ignore it. It takes a lot of conscious effort but I act as thouth I do not perceive the hostility at all. If the person really is angry, this forces them to be more direct with me about their feelings. If they are not angry, they will respond pleasantly to my friendly overtures and I will know I misinterpreted."

I always thought I never hallucinated in my entire life in every category listed, but I dream a lot when I sleep and it confuses me when I wake up like I was somewhere else in another life or some crap. I get thought or mind intrusion, and inserted thoughts into my head – stuff like that. Like one dream a long time ago, I had visions or memories of being in Canada. I get delusional and start questioning my reality like I was cloned or something even though I’ve never been in Canada and would never go there. I sometimes think it was a past life, parallel universe or some crap. It really affects my ability to enjoy and live life. I really do believe I experience constant reincarnation and soul transference into different exact copies or duplicates of myself back in time to the year 2013 or a few years earlier than that.

I feel like I’m chronically delusional and my treatment team said I have a vivid imagination and live in a damn fantasy world my entire life since psychosis back in 2011. I feel like my life has been worse than hell and thus I have skipped most of it. I think I made a deal with the “devil” in a way where I wake up in 2013 via a chip or soul/consciousness transfer and resume my life indefinitely for eternity in a time loop or according to big bounce theory. It sucks to have to relive a life again from scratch where randomness and variables are at play and you could “reroll” a far worse life.

Then we left him to go do another property and he called me later moping saying “you cant treat me like this!!! Blah blah blah” then he quit lol.

Everything shuts down for the weekends and there is little support. I stormed out of A&E earlier and the police called me as I was reported missing. Now I cannot deal with my case manager I cannot get meds or any other support. HE lied to me and I have no trust for him anymore. The voices are making me so angry and I am trying to just ride it out but I am sick a tired of my existence in it’s current form and to be honest, there is absolutely no reasonable way out of my current position.

The mental health team have known for weeks that things are not working out, and I was assured that they were going to be doing something about it. Well the first thing they said they were doing is a lie. I was supposed to have contact this weekend but that has not happened.

When I had voices I would hear my family talking badly about me that they pretended to love me, don’t love me, got paid to pretend to love me, want to kill me , think I’m ugly inside and out, etc I thought my grandma wanted to kill me and I was her favourite grandchild she was devastated but to me it was very real and agonising. I felt so betrayed that she didn’t love me when I loved her and then so much. My parents have always hated me and I still sincerely believe that they have hated me and still do but they have a touch of love for me too. I have a complicated relationship with them. They are not easy going people.they are complicated and difficult people who do have a lot of hate for me which makes our relationship difficult. I decided to appreciate my relationship with them as it is and just keep loving them even when they are hating me. When I thought my family wanted to kill me and heard awfu
l things it was agonising. (That wasn’t my only delusions and voices but it was a lot of it was my own family) Even just recently I did not believe my parents were my real parents. I was a Muslim for one year because I had a delusion a Muslim man was my real father and I even changed my name.first name and last name. I felt this Muslim man loves me more and is closer to me and doesn’t hate me so much. He could be a best friend of mine now. I still have delusions about my parents and family not being my real parents etc There is this woman who could be my closest. She loves me so much more than my parents do. My parents hate me and never loved me much but I appreciate the love they do have for me and appreciate them just as they are.they have their charm just as they are.maybe it’s not a bad thing to keep a healthy distance. I have to stand up to them and not be a push over. I love them but our relationship is complicated and to this day they still have so much hate for me . My mum tried to drown me in a 
bathtub and her husband suffocated me with a pillow and strangled me. My mum is coming to visit me for a few months and I hope it will be nice and that we can keep the peace. Last time she visited (a few years ago) it was really nice and we did not have that many fights.we Actually had some really nice moments together. I had so many voices and delusions about my family but I nolonger have voices and since the medication increase I don’t really have delusions anymore either.pretty stable. Ones family is usually ones support so to have delusions about ones loved ones is just awful. My parents truly do hate me. That is not a delusion. But they love me a touch aswell. _PERSON_ When one has delusions, paranoia etc about family one may want to isolate from them and avoid them. Thankfully my voices and delusions went away. I can live with my parents hating me because I know they have a touch of love for me aswell and because I know they are difficult complicated people. Wishing you good relationships with your fa

175927540,"I talked to a Pdoc at the time. I told him about the angels, the reason I did a bad thing, he sat with me for about 5-10 minutes and put me on Zoloft.

175927543,"Hmm. I See That You Have Chosen Not To Smoke Marijuana Anymore _AT_MENTION_. I Still Think What I’m About To Share With The Community Is Important. I Experimented With Weed Many Years Ago. Before I Was Diagnosed. But!, I Heard Voices As A Much Younger Individual And Only Heard Of Schizophrenia From Olde Stories My Mom Would Share About A Much Older Relative. Who Lived In An Asylum Her Entire Life. I Still Had No Idea What An Asylum Or Schizophrenia Was. Although As A Young Guy I Studied Many Different Countries Governmental Proceedings Within The Sphere Of Propaganda. And Of Course Military Proceedings And Violent Metaphorical Paintings Of War. A Few Years Before 9/11 Became Etched Into America’s Consciousness. Now You May Be Wondering What All Of That Has To Do With Marijuana, SZ, And American Government Issues. Well…, To Me, After I Began To Grow Into Becoming Someone Who Loathed Hatred, And Loved Art, All Mixed In A Batch Of Undiagnosed Mental Illness. It All Tied Together Of Turning Me In
to A Philosophical Bleeding Heart Filled With Passion To Discover Ways To End Any And All Wars Be It Psychological And Or Physical. And Strangely Enough, I Thought Marijuana Could Be A Key. Although During Those Days, The American Government Disagreed. And Now It’s Being Legalized, Slowly But Surely. No One In Their Right Mind Would Of Thought That To Be A Reality For Legal Issues Here In The States. And Of Course Issues On Being High Or Sober Within The Legal Stratosphere. Either Or, Smoking Even Marijuana (I Have Found), For People With Thus Illness Could Be A Treacherous Pathe To Wander On. Not So Much Dangerous Physically. But!, What One Experiences During Trips, Could Imprint A Negative Affect In The Subconscious State Of Affairs In One’s Clean And Yet To Be Understood Issue Of The Mind. Although Even As I Say That, I Am Being Reminded That One Can Get Some Really Great Rest After One Falls Asleep. Waking Up Feeling Refreshed, Recharged, And Ready To Tackle Anything That Might Come Their Way During T
he Day. Unless Of Course, The Individual Gets High Again Too Early. And Well…, Paranoia And Slight Bits Of Odd Confusion May Occur. I’m Kinda Wandering. But!, If One Uses Marijuana As A Tool For A Good Night’s Rest. Instead Of Trying To Peer Into The Void Of A Darkness That Cannot Comprehend Light. Well. Better Safe Than Sorry, As Arcade Fire’s Song Goes. Take It Easy!."

Is your ap an obstacle to feel and think? Or its more my illness now and the consequences of the loneliness and the inactivity? I just hope I didn’t make a mistake to raise the ap… 10 mgs is not a big dose, but still… Maybe I need time to feel less dull, what do you think? How much time after the sedation of the ap? Were you dulled in the start of your ap, did you recover despite this without being numbed after some time?"

175927577,"I had an experience with gaslighting, but it was a little different. A couple of years ago, I was so unwell that I required a caregiver who would come into my home to clean a bit and make sure I was eating, and she also served as a bit of an anchor for me when I couldn’t tell what was real. Then she started borrowing clothes. And calling my mother “mom”, and then cut her hair like mine. And then dyed her hair like mine. Then she started speaking like me, which was weird… she’d use my phrases and tell my anecdotes as if they had happened to her. It was Single White Female (the movie) type scary. And after awhile, she stopped cleaning or doing anything to help, as though she was just there to hang out. She wanted me to adopt one of her pets. At one point, she even had me go over to her house to help HER clean it. She convinced me I needed to help teach her child to read, and she took up all my hobbies. It wasn’t until a friend of mine was over visiting while she was there that I was pulle
d aside by my friend, who was like “what the heck is going on here?” The caregiver had made me feel like this was all my fault, because I had allowed it. My friend had to remind me that I was the patient, and that I wasn’t the one whose job it was to set boundaries. He told me, “you’re mentally ill and SHE’S the professional. This is NOT your fault. You need to report her.” But I was scared she would come after me, or tell others private things about me (she was my caregiver for 3 years. This happened over a long period of time), since she would say terrible things about her OTHER clients. She seemed threatening. (My friend did point out this little maneuver was against HIPPA, her talking about her other clients.) The people at the agency were horrified when I told them about her, finally. She was fired. So yeah, that happened. I think the moral of the story is that it wasn’t my fault, and now that I can recognise what happened, I can stop it from happening again…I hope. I’m more aware of 
people’s motives, but it soured me on having a caregiver ever again. It’s sick what some people will do to take advantage. But I’m stronger now. I’m more aware."

When I was in my psychotic break, oh boy, that was a nightmare. I was so close to killing myself EVERY DAY. I missed all of my meds (Vraylar, Lamictal, and Zoloft) on Saturday, and that was a wild ride. I almost went to the hospital after just one missed dose. I think it depends on the person and also depends on the time in their life as to label it as severe or not severe. Mine isn’t so severe when I’m properly medicated, but off medication I am extremely ill."

175927594,"I've experienced similar - although maybe not the same I experienced it when I was on high doses of antipsychotics. As well as high doses of lithium. I've wondered if, at times, it was a result of ""negative"" schizo symptoms I've experienced it after isolating too long Nowadays, I experience it when I have to be available for others for too long and I'm worn down, burnt out and not having enough enjoyment and payoff in my life. ^ That being said, I am an introvert, so do people drain me and are a lot of work. If I can't retreat, I find other ways of ""shutting off"" despite myself - including becoming ""sluggish and unmotivated"" For me, it's more about ending up with a flat affect and listlessness and mind fuzziness at that point and becoming semi-involuntarily disengaged. My psychologist says I have so much $#%^ going on that I drain out faster than most people because I'm practically ""leaking"" energy all the time anyways.

Like...I don’t have energy or motivation to do anything whatsoever. I just wake up and feel scared. Like I don’t want to leave my house at all. At all. I notice the past 2-3 days all I do is MAYBE think about what I need to do. My mind isn’t racing, it’s just completely blank from fear. I just sit and sit, for hours, past 2 days or 3. I just sit and stare into space. Usually the day goes by slow when I do that. But it sorta feel fast right now, like it’s going by fast. I have been sleeping a lot of the days tho. And I wake up and I just stare into space for the rest of the day. I don’t even remember what I’ve been doing past few days. Some but not much. I think I’m supposed to see T today."

175927620,But then again it’s easy for me to suggest what I did because I’ve always had a low sex drive.

175927630,"Hi, that must have been so hard for you growing up with such circumstances! That would be so difficult to see many parents every single day, when you lost yours at such a young age. It would be very hard for anyone that has lost a loved one, and I’m proud of you, for being strong enough to still work there. I still have both parents, and I can’t even imagine how hard it must be for you to not have the extra support from them – even though sometimes they aren’t as supportive as I think they should be, at the end of the day, they are always there. How is this job affecting your mental health, though? Sorry for the direct question, but it’s important to stand back and see if the job is good for your mental health, or if it’s infrequent that you feel bittersweet about it. Another thing – What does your support group look like? Sometimes, being with friends around your age, or even a bit older than you as well, it can help to relieve the feelings you’re experiencing. Thank you for reachi

175927631,"“I am going to leave the forum, do you like me?” That it’s always a good one. But you shouldn’t use it."
175927632,True. My amisulpride took me from a self-harming depressed and psychotic and unable-to-cope woman to a lighter more confident and clear-headed woman - in two days!! And pretty much keeps on keeping me going

175927634,"Sometimes the Seroquel hits me super hard. Some nights nothing. I haven’t had that experience with other meds apart from Latuda. But the seroquel helps. _AT_MENTION_ do you ever get racing heart with the seroquel? I do, not often but when I do it’s horrid."
175927635,I noticed that I’m less paranoid off of Depakote I’m also more alert off Depakote. But don’t get me wrong if you suffer from severe bipolar symptoms then Depakote could be a good choice.
175927636,"I mean to me, someone who is delusional is suffering obviously. But looking at peoples delusions I think back to when I was kid. As I rode my bike or wrestled or fought with my friends or had water balloon fights or whatever, none of these grand delusions manifested themselves in any way. It was simple: I got on my bike and peddled, I threw a football, I played in the dirt. I came home and my mom fixed me soup and a sandwich and I ate it and then went outside and romped with the dog. Even when I got older and smoked pot all it involved was passing the bong ( never, ever, drink bong water lol.) and feeling high and going to eat ice cream and then sitting there listening to Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith in the first phase of their career. I hope I’m not insulting anyone but delusions aren’t giving anyone special answers. Realty is driving to work, coming home and fixing dinner and cleaning house. This is how life works. Like I said, I have delusions too and I include myself in this mess of life. But 
my delusions don’t mean anything once I step out of my house. If I’m shopping at Safeway or getting stamps at the post office why doesn’t any of these grand delusions manifest themselves in any way? I’ve never seen god at Rite-Aid, I see vitamins on sale for half price or ex-lax- buy one-get another one half off. Now that’s reality in spades. I don’t know the answer except if you see someone is delusional, at the very most try to talk them down or something. At the very least, don’t feed into their delusions."

175927670,Perhaps the third variable could be that the D.E.N Is making the AP stronger . Which is a win because you need less But if you were to stop the AP there would be nothing like an antipsychotic to strengthen… Idk… Just a theory… Since I also took D.E.N And it was a negative experience due to dopamine sensitivity. I have about 10months now off of my AP My dystonia at night has subsided By I get melt downs fail due to autism And I have anger problems and obsessions I get paranoia at night filled with distrustfulness of the people I care and love . My diet consist of organic vegetables and fruits Drinking hydrogenated water with distilled water I like fermented foods with a probiotic mixture Im also going to the gym every couple days I am doing mantra and mediations. I am currently taking magnesium l threonate Cbd 30mg 3x a day Brahmi Holy basil Gaba Ltheanine Relora blend 5htp at night I will be ordering some lions mane and shilajit soon… But to be honest I think I might just end up getting on a 
small Antipsychotic To help with the meltdowns I’ve been having… Maybe the fact that I’m autistic doesn’t make it easier on me… The stuff I do in my life and the things I’ve been taking have drastically helped a lot! Maybe a small AP will be the _NAME_ on the cake I wonder if there are things I can take to lessen the impact on my body from the antipsychotic.(if I decide to take it anytime soon) Some part of me really wants to try the new one coming out Lumateperone

It has my initials, it has the word ""faith"" and the word ""recovery"" and 2020 because that is the year I got serious about recovering from SH. (300 days tomorrow). On the inside of the ring you could engrave it. So I put ""Don't give up!"" And ""God's Got You!"" I'm excited. It was kind of expensive $300 but if/when I make it to January 25, 2021 it will be a year. I figured that was worth it. Less than a dollar a day!"

After the onset and in particolar when she recovered from the onset of schizophrenia, she said to me that when she was a teenager (10-16 years) she just had sometimes visual disturbances and blurried vision. Basing on the actual knowledge of the illness and basing on all theories about schizophrenia, is possible to say that maybe stressful Life events preceding the onset may not have been a trigger factor of the illness and the causes of illness are maybe others?"

175927698,No you’re not triggering me. It’s helpful. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ I just have seen things. Said things that I didn’t mean. But they got twisted interpreted and heard differently as a prophecy. The reason I pretended I was black on the internet from 14-19 years old. Well a lot of reasons but _PERSON_ was one of the main reasons. And _PERSON_ said “I’m not saying I’m gonna change the world but I guarantee I will spark the brain that will change the world”. I don’t realky desire to be famous often. I think I used to desire it but now I just desire to make art and improve my health and insights. But I sometimes feel I’m stuck on a path I can’t escape. My progress has been incredible. I don’t see it slowing down soon. From 0-25 I was blank. My birth was a miracle like Jesus. My name starts with j. My mom was 43 coming off 4 miscarriages and had a blood clot and I got the umbichal chord wrapped around my neck. Despite that I was healthy but no I wasn’t I think that tr
iggered some mental illness my traumatic birth. My dads jewish. Sometimes I think I am Jesus half brother or something. Someone suggested that to me. Sometimes I feel I just have a story to tell. I know that some fishy stuff is going on though. I have some purpose. Someday. Somehow. Somewhere. I know it. We all do. But I have more of a purpose than I originally thought.

175927701,Do you find that drug combination works well for you otherwise?
175927702,"_PERSON_, you’re okay. We all have those thoughts sometimes. I generally try to keep mine private, because it can trigger some people, OR my “reality” (which i might add is very real to me), is invalidated. Then I feel invalidated. Which is the mistake there… Try not to think of the very real feelings you have about your theories as being the things we have trouble with. I don’t think any of us want to invalidate YOU. YOU are real. YOU are here. YOU are one of us. It’s just hard for some of us to separate what’s real from what’s not real. But while the ideas might be “false”, or different, your experience isn’t, and your feelings aren’t. Like I said, all of us here think and say some pretty weird things now and then. I know I do. And I think of you as a member of this community, and you are. This is a safe place for you, I’d hope. Your input is valued, though a few people might find it difficult to relate to it. This doesn’t mean you’re “crazy” or “bad.” I didn
’t feel triggered personally by your post, even though your reality just doesn’t match mine. I hope your thoughts on the subject – whatever they are now – bring you the feeling that the world makes sense to you somehow. That’s all that matters, sometimes. You matter too. Shake it off. You are appreciated."

174334981,"Anyone else do this? My mom insists that most of or all my delusions come from the TV. I guess some of it’s true like I told my mom I can remember being born in a dark room. She said the room was very bright. I guess I could have got it from the TV. I also told her about the movie Groundhog Day (time loop). After watching a YouTube video on _NAME_ (time travel physicist), I told her I remember meeting my grandfather. Mr. _PERSON_ wanted to visit his father who was a TV repair man. My grandfather was one too. In fact, I remember meeting both my grandfathers who are both deceased. I guess this is very common with schizophrenia. I still believe it to be true but I realize my memory is not okay at all. It’s not perfect. I laugh when my mom says I was born because I feel like the guy from groundhog day reliving my life over and over again for eternity as a paranoid schizophrenic. I sometimes wonder if there is another version of me out there… I also think my mom is kinda slow, but I love her and s

The fact that I tripped after being diagnosed with schizophrenia and took chemicals that not many people have taken - Must have changed my brain. I know I'm not too stupid or too smart - But there's something wrong with me. I hope this is just a phase. I want to read but I'm either not relaxed enough or too tired to do it - Or most things that I want to do. Every couple of weeks or months, it's like I'm a completely different person - And I forget what happened to how I felt previously. I don't know if anyone that posts here - Or even my family are in all the same state - Or if I'm in a transition to becoming like everyone else and I've missed the whole point all of my life."

175927825,"My newspaper had a large frontpage article about the lack of good care for chronic psychiatric patients. It said - again - that about half the people got a wrong diagnosis. Often people were diagnosed with sz when they actually were autistic and just getting psychotic because of being overwhelmed. Problems like trauma or addiction also went unrecognised mostly. Also other issues like with finances or housing. These people need help in several areas of life, and with it 30% could recover. They dont because mental health organisations arent doing their jobs. Was the conclusion. Many of the sample researched could do with much less meds than prescribed and thus much less side effect. People arent getting psychotherapy, where it could be helpful. I have been shouting this at my pdocs for years and they declared me difficult and ill and crazy because of it. Sorry for the frustration. But i think people should stand up for us."

175927899,"Good morning, woke up at 3:30 in the morning and couldn't get back to sleep"
175927900,I wish I was just burying the grass! Had to dig it all up by hand and throw it in a skip. Even snapped a metal shovel!
175927901,"Funny. Yeah, I was dumb enough to have signed it as well. That’s how I got caught."
175927902,"I did so much work in 4.5 hours today that it felt like an 8 hour day. I was constantly washing dishes, pealing and chopping carrots, white and red onions, big and small potatoes - Oh crap I forgot to lay out bacon.. I wasn't listening to any music or podcasts because I was focused on my past and thinking about childhood memories. I try to make time to remember my memories so I don't get as much amnesia.. But it's hard. I felt different today - Time was going incredibly slow. But anyways yeah I had a shower when I got home, organized, etc.. Then I smoked some high CBD weed, took kratom and a taper phenibut dose.. I then attempted to read the rest of roll call but I when I was finished reading any line, my brain wouldn't absorb it - So I took 10mg Dexedrine IR. Not sure if that is kicking in or weed wearing off - But yeah... I did feel very relaxed with the CBD weed it's what I needed to wind down. I might read today or try and do something, listen to music, chill... Hugs to all"
175927903,You have insight so that’s a good thing.
175927904,Yeah true. I’ve been painting since last September/October I think. But stopped for around 6 weeks due to surgery. So I’ve been painting for around 4-5 months only.
174335009,That must be horrible to suffer for so long…What negative symptoms do you have? I never had any negatives.
175927905,"I checked my weight, I gained some since stopping the metformin. I hope the 29th comes quick. I have an appointment to discuss alternative appetite suppressant meds with my psych. I'm kind of upset I gained a few lbs."
175927906,"I went through 4 or 5 other medicines with rough side effects until I landed on Zyprexa. Had akathisia on 20mg and 10mg, but when we reduced it to 7.5mg the side effects went away. I’ve been taking 7.5mg Zyprexa daily for over a year now and it’s really helped me."
175927907,"I noticed that the threads that get the most attention are the creativity threads. Do you think that people with sz are more tuned into creativity, or is it just that anywhere artistic threads get more attention and if anything you have no creativity?"
175927908,Oh you must not be in the US. I forget it works differently elsewhere
175927909,Don’t give up hope. It’s possible you can have a significant other in the future.
175927910,"I used to be on amitriptyline, which also had the side effect of not being allowed in direct sunlight. I was fine as long as I wore sunscreen. Even at the beach, or playing volleyball out with friends. The only time I ever had trouble was when we were helping our friend move, and I forgot to put on sunscreen. I was sick for two days."

175927914,I take 80 mg twice a day. Before that I was just taking 20 mg at night but I was really unstable on that dose. The 80 morning and night quells my hallucinations but I have visuals that also talk to me more than voices but I did have voices too. I also got text messages in my head. The voices and visuals are all strangers that I know of. It’s not easy to tell when I am hallucinating because it’s very realistic. But the text messages all come from people I know. It says who it’s from when it pops in my head. The last one I got was from my wife and that’s been several years ago now. So long as I don’t miss a dose I don’t hallucinate anymore. But occasionally I forget my morning dose and I get some visuals. I also take 40 mg of Latuda a day.
175927915,"Yeah the only problem with that is that I need to meet some of these bigger goals such as getting a paper done for grad school, etc. I don't know what small goal I'd set. Write a page? I don't know."

175927917,I get them quite often and it's stressful. I'm worried that it's psychosis or something.

175927919,"Slowly and overtime. Please dont quit cold turkey, you’ll get horrible parethesia and it’ll be really hard to breathe."
175927920,"It’s constant and bothers me a lot. I can’t just ignore it anymore. The experience is so pronounced, it really does eat away at me. In my head my voice fights back sometimes, and that makes it worse as they have started answering me back, and I don’t feel that I am in control of it anymore My doctor has to sign off my driving once a year at the moment, and if he says no, I lose it"
175927921,"It sounds like your condition is quite chronic and you could benefit from working with a therapist or team of mental health professionals that specialize in chronic depression and anxiety. You might also have some personality traits that lend themselves to holding you back as well. If you haven't already, you should definitely consider medication. Medication could help to mitigate some of the biological factors that contribute to anxiety and depression. Regarding your boyfriend, it sounds like he might be getting frustrated and tired with the situation as well. Although you are the person experiencing this inability to meet goals and thrive in life, it's also difficult for him. It can be challenging for loved ones when they've tried everything they know to do and it's still continuing with persistence. I can appreciate his words might be upsetting but maybe turning outward to hear him and hold space for this thoughts and feelings might help you experience the situation with more compassion for your
self and him alike. Just remember the opposite of support isn't frustration or anger, such as you experienced in your boyfriend's comments. The opposite of support is indifference. It's when people do nothing and say nothing they truly neglect to support us. Best of luck in your journey and I hope you find the path that shed's light for you."
175927922,It is easier than being married.
175927923,"Do you know what has pulled you up from prior bad bouts of depression? Is there anything that, in a better moment, you might wonder why you didn't try this or that? You seem extremely self-aware, so to give you guidance that you could give yourself hardly seems like what you need right now. Maybe you need more externally imposed structure than you're getting. Maybe an adjustment in meds. Whatever it is, it'll not be a silver bullet, but a way of chipping away at daily life until the depression starts to lift. I hope that comes soon, and you get some relief. Also some hugs."
175927924,"That’s incredible! I think I would die if I tried to do that. I couldn’t do that, who am I kidding? I just got back from _PERSON_’s. I am trading in my size 3X clothes for 2X now. I bought some tops to wear to a job and two pairs of pants. The pants are size 22, down from a 26. I have two tops I really love that I bought in a 3X in April - I bought them again on clearance in a 2X and 1X so I have them for my entire weight loss journey. They were marked down to $8 each so I couldn’t say no. I am still job hunting, but I’m volunteering any day now after my background check comes back, and I need nice clothes to wear there. I feel much better in the smaller size. It will help me be more confident when I rejoin the job market."
175927925,"Oh cool your diagnosis was recent! Mine was 5 years ago (that’s when the voices started). I was so happy when I recovered from delusions between the third and fourth year, I wanted to spread that good news that it was possible. I really do think the first 5-10 years is an optimal window for recovery. The fact that you haven’t had it long is a very good thing and should keep you hopeful for the next several years! And even if things are still rough then, new medicine is a possibility. I still hear voices but they don’t have much power over me, since I have insight. I love to chat with people on the forum here. Some people say they have had their voices disappear, I would love that but am not sure it’s possible for me. The disorder is different for everybody. It took me a couple years to land on Zyprexa, which is the only antipsychotic that I can really tolerate. It’s been very helpful in keeping me grounded. Hopefully you find the right med for you soon! It’s hard to find because every m
ed can affect people differently, but finding the right one is awesome. Welcome to the forums!"
175927926,I was watching comedians stories about psychedelics so now I feel like nothing is real and a bit scared. Not going for a run in this mind state. My mom is stressed about work. I don't know what I'm doing. I feel alone. The only thing grounding me is a podcast with a nutritionist. _USER_ID_: Took an olanzepine. Feeling a bit sad.

And the whole time I still heard the screams of my loved ones being tortured by demons. Believe me, no matter how hard you pray, your symptoms won’t go away. If you believe in God, believe that God guided humans to develop medications and therapy as His tools to help us get better. If you don’t believe in God, no reason to start now."

174335011,"Computer related works like web designing, coding, data entry etc this doesn’t require much interaction with people face to face so if you have issues like anxiety, social anxiety, OCD, schizo, bipolar etc it will not interfere much with the work. Library related works like sorting books and placing books back to shelf etc. In grocery shops, grocery arrangement like works which does not require interaction with customers. These are just few but many there what to look for in jobs is which doesn’t require much interaction with people face to face."

175927952,"_AT_MENTION_ , I think I can relate. Just recently I’ve been chatting on and off with a couple people from my high school. And one of them told me that the other person I’m talking to was saying nice things about me. And I’m thinking to myself “Why would anyone say something nice about me.” I’ve even convinced myself these two people might be playing a prank on me. I suppose in reality, most people generally mean well, even though they have flaws and problems."

I definitely have a tendency to seek the agreement of others on issues that I feel emotional about, but now I am wondering if such a tendency is in reality destructive and counter-productive to my mental health. I think emotionally investing in the opinions of others leads to emotional instability, whilst seeking to change someone’s mind without emotional investment is insincere and fraudulent. I am wondering whether one should ever try to change someone’s mind, or simply be the best one can and bring other’s along by example. Thank you."

I’ve since been on medication for schizophrenia and depression. I found that once I got my drinking under control through Alcoholics anonomous (5 months sober!) my symptoms of schizophrenia and paranoid thinking lessened. Is there anyone else in this forum in AA?

175928024,A hooker? xD I’m not wasting my money on that
175928026,Yeah thats the complicated explanation. New research is finding that you don’t actually get much cholesterol from food sources your liver makes it from trans fats and the like. It is still present in food it just doesn’t contribute a lot to your overall level or something like that? Its confusing. I am struggling a lot with controlling my diet as well. Fast food addiction is really really hard to overcome so I feel you. You have to treat it like any other addiction really.

175928039,That’s what you say every time you do/say something offensive. Why don’t you just not post things that upset people and maybe you’d have a better relationship with people on the forum. Or don’t and accept that some people won’t like you.
175928040,I started having sleep problems when my psychosis started. I kept waking up having horrific nightmares and dreams for a good while and eventually it started to go away. Then I kept waking up over and over again throughout the middle of the night. I tried 6 different medications and nothing was working. When I stopped exercising is when my symptoms eased up. I take .75 mg of Clonazepam and 50mg of Benadryl at night to sleep and get a good 10 - 12 hours of sleep. I wish I would sleep less but I feel good when I wake up so it’s working.

175928048,"So been a bit lapse in my study program the last few days, largely due to dysfunctional sleep patterns. Today I only really did my t’ai ji and read a little. I’ve finished the physics book I was reading which is great. I want to start reading a health economics text book. I started it before, but couldn’t keep it up as it got too technical. I’m going to start from the beginning again and try and read it again. There is a possibility if I can stay sane for long enough that I could get funding to do a masters in health economics. I’d like that very much, but so far I’ve never managed to stay sane long enough for the idea to be viable. Sanity is my top priority. I also want to finish the first chapter of my complex analysis notes, I only have one more section to do, and go back to analysing the diseases of the heart each day. I might try and finish the complex analysis note this evening. There is still time. Thank you."

175928057,Yes lithium can be harsh on the kidneys and thyroid but as far as finding a potent mood stabilizer then lithium becomes an option. Topomax is a very weak mood stabilizer. Have you considered trying out Tegretol? It’s less harsh on the body and is more effective than Topomax.

174335038,I also had severe side effects on clozapine so I switched to risperidone. The only thing is one must come off clozapine very gradually or the withdrawal symptoms will be severe. I had a pdoc who switched me to risperidone drastically and I had a severe crisis and had to go to hospital for a few days till the meds adjusted in my system. So yes you can come off clozapine but make sure your pdoc helps you off it gradually. I’m on amisulpride and olanzapine and got good results on it. Never tried abilify so I can’t say how that is.
174335042,"Actually, I have noticed that my negative symptoms seem to get worse whenever I am deficient on just about ANY nutrient.

175928097,That’s ok. 1515
174335039,Yes I still have mild psychosis - occasionally voices and thought insertion but not too bad on meds. And my delusions are long there. One I had for eight years and another for five. But I settled on amisulpride and olanzapine because they quietened my mood swings and agitation and self harm urges and softened the voices. I could take double the dose and feel even better but I prefer to take minimum dose to cope and if I get symptoms worse then I take higher dose temporarily.
175928098,Or you missed out on some Chlamydia

Maybe I'll just try some Robitussin"
174335037,"I got myself all worked up with the idea that I might be able to come off the meds, and I might get to ditch the Schizophrenia label. I am not sure I am cut out for the exploratory nature of psychology and therapy. If I can get myself tied up in knots over a 45 min session and be in a mess about it for over a week now, I don’t think I should continue it. I am being told it’s all part of a process, but I do not understand what direction we’re going in, or what it is we’re actually trying to achieve. It’s all very confusing for me. If I did have autism, or at least some traits, it makes me angry that it has been missed for 32 years and I can’t help but think now about all those times I have been taken advantage of because of my lack of social understanding and whether I was just a gullible idiot or had some reasonable explanation for it."

I’m around higher functioning people with no mi at work and it stresses me out to the max. I’m not a talker, I’m a thinker and this really seems to bother some of my coworkers. I’ve never understood what other people get out of socializing. I’ve always been an introvert, it’s just the way I’m wired.

174335057,"Mental abuse as a child, and 19 years married to a mental abuser. I had no psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms until middle age, although I did suffer anxiety as a child and all throughout my marriage."
175928158,What symptoms do you have? I hope it will do well for you.
175928159,What? No it isn’t.
175928160,I’m down to 97kg!
175928161,I have no idea what you’re talking about.
175928162,"Antipsychotic “brain damage” is a complex unresolved scientific issue. The science points to it somehow being involved in/mediating illness-induced damage, but frequency of psychotic episodes themselves are the most correlated with increasing damage, and the damage is also seen before medication, even before clinical symptoms, and can sometimes progress although usually remains stable after illness. So I would tell you that since antipsychotics prevent episodes, they are a good thing. But this cognitive issue can be a side effect. Talk to your doctor about switching medications if it is intolerable."
175928163,"I’d say taking pot at a work party. I lost my marbles for about twenty minutes. Thank goodness it was a goodbye party (we were all laid off), I would’ve been too embarrassed to show up to work again."

I remember she was a Latin woman and I was speaking at length and I asked her flat out If she spoke English eventually in a pure hearted way. Also I gave her my bar of soap brought by my folks, which I mistakenly thought smelled like ‘paste’ from kindergarten. I think she showered and caught respect from the nurse, I felt good anyway. We spoke once more at length after that."

175928167,Fuuk that is a lot of calories in one go. Cool
175928168,I think it depends on the website. Try and find one that is popular in your area. I met quite a number of nice women on Dating Buzz which was very popular in South Africa. I met no one on Dating Buddies and Zoosk cause they were mostly global with few local women. I tried Nolongerlonely but there are less than a handfull of people from South Africa. This was done in my pre-diagnosed years more than ten years ago. I’m not interested in a relationship anymore
175928169,I used to for sure. I thought I was a deity of some sort. I would have thoughts that I could read other's thoughts. I could think really happy things or really sad things on command.
175928170,Sorry you have been through that. I wish you luck with finding a new job. I cannot go on disability. I doubled down on working without realising how boxed in it would make me. I would have to commit financial suicide to get disability to help me
175928171,"I lost a lot of friends after I had my first psychotic break. I blame it on the 2 months in the hospital and the year or so it took to be semi-recovered. During that year I had basically only contact with close family. It was the period where high school ended and college was just beginning, but I never had that post highschool summer to say “goodbye” before everyone was going to college."

175928180,"https://www._USER_ID_.org/Blogs/_USER_ID_-Blog/December-2016/The-Impact-of-Music-Therapy-on-Mental-Health When I worked at a residential treatment center, I was notified that a child refused to continue meeting with his usual therapist. Even though he was initially hesitant to meet with me, he soon became excited for our music therapy sessions. In our first session, we decided to look at the lyrics of “Carry On” by FUN. I asked him to explain what it means to be a “shining star,” which is mentioned serval times in the song. I was expecting this 8-year-old to tell me something simple, like “it means you’re special.” But he surprised me when he stated, matter-of-factly: “It means that you are something others notice. It means you are something to look up to, and you are something that helps others navigate.” And just like that: This lyric offered the opportunity to discuss self-worth, resilience, and strength. Music provided him with the structure and opportunity to process in an en
gaging way. Soon, his therapist began attending our sessions to help build a healthier therapeutic relationship. His family and teachers reported improved emotion regulation and social interaction skills. Music therapy had provided countless opportunities for building healthy relationships, just as it has for thousands of others. Try it for yourself! Check out the American Music Therapy Association to find a board certified or licensed music therapist near you. There’s a couple of songs I really relate to. Nothing as deep as this child’s perspective though. Music really gets the juices going for fitness related things. Good stuff. I’m sure it probably helps you more than me because I really don’t know that much about music. I don’t think anyone has anything bad to write about it."

175928194,I would like to try it but I am stable and working full time so I am afraid to experiment but I can tell you that a shot of that and some Ativan at the hospital had me feeling the best I have ever felt while sick. It took a few days for the psychosis to go away still but 3 or 4 days later and I felt great for a short while. Once I got back stable on Geodon though the blah all came back. Good luck with it.
175928195,"Going for walks, energy drinks, ibuprofen"

175928207,"Hi. No, you are actually not the first one who noticed autistic traits in me. I just wondered why I fely so off during my childhood years. I was constantly bullied and abused for it. I thought it was a shameful thing, or something that should never be talked about. That’s why I never talked about any of it in the forum because I thought I was being stupid and off. I always hated that I couldn’t stare at people in the eye when I was younger, take things super literally, have occasional meltdowns, and why I was stopped everytime when I tried to calm myself. So please don’t feel guilty or feel the need to apologize. To be honest, I’m never coming off of my antipsychotics. They are lifesavers. Sz stays with me."
175928208,"That's a very tough decision. I don't know what meth is like, unless it causes sz. But usually after the first time, which is apparently very stimulating, the more use the more you're just chasing after the dragon you'll never feel again. I would say he's probably addicted... I mean... Who does meth ""recreationally?"" Plus it ruins teeth. Usually I say as long as people aren't waking the horses up with whatever they are doing then whatever, it's their prerogative. But there are children involved. I honestly think he needs an intervention if this is a regular thing like you said he does it. Maybe suggest to your friend that he might need one, and that it's coming from a place of love friendship that you say this."

174335070,"I now exactly how I could have prevented schizophrenia. It was, in my case, due to behavioural considerations. People forget that schizophrenia is a very human condition and the psychology of how you behave is in my opinion, directly correlated to how you feel. I’ve had a number of bad habits and they serve as a trigger towards anxiety. For instance, I’ve never had a hallucination, not that all people with schizophrenia have. So I’ve definitely had schizophrenia, but it was of my own making. Throughout my early 20’s I would go out on walks with my iPod and not come back till the morning the next day. So I crashed. This was compounded by bad habits, which now I’ve quit, mean I now feel much less anxiety and can begin to do normal tasks again E.g. chores etc. Yet one faint positive I can get out of schizophrenia is that it’s made me more determined than ever to succeed. I want to become an entrepreneur. I’m 32, so still have a bit more time. I take 400mg of Clopixol each 4 weeks."

C Oyku Memis, D Sevincok, B Dogan, C _PERSON_, M Ozbek, A _PERSON_, B Cakaloz and L Sevincok, Rivista di psichiatria , Jul-Aug 2019 The primary objective of this study was to compare the adult-onset and adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients in terms of the subthreshold autistic traits.29 adolescent, and 45 adult-onset OCD patients were assessed by Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ).The ratio of males to females, the frequency of ritualistic compulsions, and the mean number of lifetime compulsions were significantly higher in adolescents with OCD compared to adult-onset patients. Adult-onset OCD patients had significantly higher scores on total, social skills, attention shifting, and imagination subscales of AQ than adolescent OCD patients. The mean number of compulsions, attention shifting scores of AQ, and female gender significant
ly predicted the distinction between adolescent and adult-onset OCD patients. In adult-onset patients, there were significant correlations between the mean number of lifetime obsessions and total, social skills, attention switching, communication, and imagination subscale scores of AQ.We suggest that subthreshold autistic traits may play a significant role in the occurence of obsessive-complusive symptoms (OCS) in adult-onset OCD. Autistic traits seemed to be higher and had an closer relationship with the frequency of lifetime obsessions in AO-OCD patients than in adolescent patients.

175928279,"lol _PERSON_ Cotton, I came across a Tedtalk of an author of a book about psychopaths. He says that there is this guy beat someone up, then subsequently faked being insane because he wanted to be sent to the mental hospital. His original sentence was 5 years. Because he faked his his insanity, he was diagnosed with psychopathy, he got sent to the highest security psych ward called Broadmoor. Then he stayed there for 12 years. I think this is what’s happening to you now. You originally just have autism, but you faked your psychosis too well, now everyone believes you are a psychopath."

175928281,"I've had severe anxiety attacks in the past, and I needed medication to control it. Anxiety usually comes from deeper issues. You can't really dismiss it, you have to work thru it and understand what made you feel like that to begin with. Your feelings are real and valid. If you are able, try to find a therapist to help you work thru it. I found that talking about my feelings, to someone that could actually listen, was a big help. And it took some time."
175928282,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. You can take over for a while if you would like. I’m going to nap and hope I feel better in an hour or two.
175928283,That’s too bad to hear. Take care at this dangerous period of time and just wait for the vaccines for COVID to come.

174335081,"I never wanted children. It was like a sixth sense telling me not to have them. Then I got diagnosed with schizophrenia and it all made sense. I wouldn’t be able to look after them. I’m 51 now, so I don’t need to worry about ever having them I guess."

174335083,Whether it is bipolar or schizoaffective (working dx) I’m gonna have to accept it as I can’t change it except for how I deal with it. I guess I can still get psychosis for bipolar with psychotic features so treatment is basically the same. I’m gonna have to accept I’m stuck on antipsychotics

I told him to go up in price and he’s like “I already told him 60...” He never listens to me. Never about anything. Not this, not the mask/COVID situation. not about school, work, spending time with me. He doesn’t listen to me at all. He wants to do what he wants to do in life. And then he has the nerve the complain about things or say I’m nagging about spending time together, when I’m at my breaking point of loneliness. I’m closer to my fckin dad at this point for god sakes. I tried to get him to take care of school for 4 or 5 months now. “I’ll do it tomorrow I promise”. Etc etc. me: can we be intimate? “Tomorrow”. Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow. Put this shyt off. Put me off. Fck around and I’ll get up and leave. Sorry..."

175928302,"Hello, Sorry if i make a mistake or seem confused i am new to this haha. My name is _NAME_ and lately i’ve been struggling. I’m not sure when it started but whenever i go to school specifically I get very anxious when i sit in the classroom and I get a very irrational fear that I feel i can’t tell a whole lot of people because it is embarrassing. Recently, I’ve started taking days off of school and last week i tested out not eating very much during the week to see if it helped. I’m not sure if it really helped or not but besides the fact that i was hungry idk if i felt less anxious or if it was all in my head. Therapy is very expensive and whenever i talked with friends about this I don’t really know what to say so i just sound kinda awkward and dramatic. I’ve also lost motivation for my future and sometimes i feel like i’ll have no options and won’t amount to anything at all and that I will just be unhappy. I don’t really know what i’m doing on here and if you read through al
l of this my apologies, but i had some sort of hope that maybe a support group or such could help some."

They look so good, I think I’ve literally bought two cakes in my entire life just for myself. I want to buy a huge chocolate cake and bring it home and take it out of the box and grab two handfuls with my bare hands and just cram that stuff in my mouth. Then just take all my clothes off and just smear the rest all over my entire body and then roll all over the carpet. THEN pick up the mess and put it in my hair and massage it into my scalp like some kind of obscene, decadent shampoo. HELL!! I’m worked up now, I’m going to go watch me some porn."

175928313,"I feel completely out of sorts this morning. I talked about switching psychiatrists here, and what happened is the new psychiatrist wanted to reduce my Xanax XR by half.

I personally think after what happened the first time it’s a dangerous thing to do. I was very psychotic, and losing complete reality and being sedated like that just is not a good mix.

As a child I was broken down and molded to conform. I now feel dysphoric on and off. I remember not wanting to exist at 10 years old but didn't really know what suicide was. Then I played the game of life and went numb two years later. I trust people because I don't care if they screw me over. I'm not even potential. Just ****_NAME_ up emotions and no thoughts. I can be happy but really everyone expects me to think a certain way and continue to play the game. I'm not a real person. I don't want to hang around people that glorify their failures and poverty, drink and judge. Everyone else has it all together. They aren't tortured by demons like me. I feel like someone that isn't really me. I don't care enough about common things that people do. I can't stand talking about irrelevant things because everything is irrelevant. There's no point in living like 
everyone else. I see no joy in how everything is always a problem caused by evil people. Humans are shallow and technology has ruined everything. Everyone is scared. People argue constantly over issues that will never be solved. The world will end. I can't stand who I am. I don't know what I want. I hate myself. Everything is not ok. I go up and down. I break down once it all gets too much. I can't pay attention to detail because I don't want to. But I can, deeply and focus harder when I'm forced. Then I'm a product of the fear. A machine. They want me to be a machine. Everyone does. My step dad did. No one seems to understand that order doesn't exist. There's always rules that don't make sense. I'm not one of them. I would lead the world into truth if I was even able to take care of myself. But I don't care about myself. It's like entities of certain emotions are ripping my mind apart and I'm tied to chains in a prison. I miss the calmness and crave the destruction. If I didn't have people that cared about m

175928349,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Serious Games, Gamification, and Serious Mental Illness: A Scoping Review. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.) , Oct 23 2019 The use of serious games and gamification to promote learning has a long history. More recently, serious games and gamification have been used in clinical settings to promote treatment and recovery. Yet there is little evidence to support their use with populations that experience serious mental illness.A scoping review was used to answer the following research question, What is the current state of knowledge about how games and gamification are used to promote treatment of serious mental illness? Scoping reviews clarify, define, and develop conceptual boundaries within a topic area. Twenty studies were identified and reviewed by using thematic content analysis.A range of game types, formats, and technology were assessed. Six themes emerged from analysis. Serious games and the use of gamification to promote treatment have potential 
to engage persons with serious mental illness in game content and promote treatment outcomes. Game design that supported clear instruction, a coherent narrative, a smooth interface between mechanics and play, and service user involvement early in the process of game design were important for the successful promotion of engagement and learning. Games reviewed offered the opportunity for problem solving, collaboration, and goal-oriented activity that supported the delivery of therapeutic outcomes.The use of serious games and gamification to promote treatment of serious mental illness had high levels of feasibility and acceptability among both users and providers. The potential treatment value of games, however, is dependent on key features related to the games' design, operation, and rationale."

I also notice I pick up wifi that’s not in order like the closest one will be at the bottom and stuff and it shifts around and then some seemed fixed points. I don’t know. I know I’m reading too much. I think it’s gangstalkers and harassment. I even seen names pop up that I googled or heard about, which is strange. I’ve seen UFOs and aliens and even experimental drones and crafts over the years. I’m glad it’s a prank. People suck. I can hear people talk about my schizophrenia and I pick up conversations through the wall like a mutant or psychic I think. I might have also read minds in a past life with other life and had my mind read many times… Seen green fire in the sky which is 
a astronomical phenomenon too. It spooked me. This stuff scares me for years. I’m still trying to recover. I’m traumatized. I think pranks like that should carry hefty fines and jail time. I think people know I got some schizophrenia going on – I never change my clothes and I smoke cigs and don’t work. I think some of the neighbors talk about me and hate me. I just wanna move. It was worse by my dad’s place. I really enjoy my family."

175928395,"Let me tell you what war has done to my family. My grandmother was just a teenager when her home was hit during the Korean War. She and her mother fled but were captured. However, they managed to escape. The war led our grandmother’s family to live in poverty, but they were not in extreme poverty. This led her to marry a man that she didn’t know well. She lost my grandfather to cancer when she was just in her 50s. My mother wed my father when my grandfather had terminal cancer. Now, she’s 80 years old and she still remembers the war- the horrific memories of escaping the war and the poverty afterwards. It lives on with our family and I won’t forget her sacrifice. May my grandfather rest in peace."
175928396,"The medication label says don't drink at all, and I know that would be safest. But there is a ""quality of life"" issue for me, because I enjoy drinking in moderation (one or two drinks, never more). I asked my primary care doc and my pdoc, and they both said that, in my case, it should be fine to have a glass or two of wine, or beer, when I feel like it. I find that when I drink beer, it does not affect me. But when I drink wine, my sleep is impaired. (I don't sleep so well to begin with). Does anyone else here notice a difference between wine + SSRI and beer + SSRI? I am drinking, in each case, about the same amount of alcohol, but the effect is different."

I heard about it awhile ago. I wonder if they still exist in Japan. en.wikipedia.org Satori generation Satori generation (?????) is a Japanese language neologism used to describe young Japanese who have seemingly achieved the Buddhist enlightened state free from material desires but who have in reality given up ambition and hope due to macro-economic trends.

174335117,Hmmm I thought the difference was if you had mood elements triggering the psychosis or if thy occurred independently?
175928403,I rock a lot too. It calms me a bit.
175928404,It's gonna be a 2.7x increase in dose so be careful. You might feel a little stimmed. Unless 24hr is just taking it every 24hr and extended release throughout the day and the blood concentration is very low while you sleep. _USER_ID_: Nvm the half life is like 35 hours but I think 3x the dose still kind of applies. That's why it takes weeks to kick in.

175928408,Never good to worry about what might happen. Just deal with the now. Talking is good. Communication is the start of good relationships and making an effort is a good thing. You don’t have to do much to say some nice things for example. It does help in the long run.

174335106,"After years of my family not willing to slow down their style to adjust to an invalid daughter, the diagnosis of sz didn’t help any. They didn’t understand it. Neither did I, actually. I was a stranger to myself."

174335114,It’s just a crapshoot. Abilify has done wonders for me but it mightn’t suit you. Meds are just personal trial and error. Best of luck.

175928416,It sounds like you are already at the place where you need help. I understand not wanting to bother anybody but it might be time to go to the ER. Better to let the doctors decide if you need the hospital or whatever. Please don’t let this go on for too much longer without getting help.
175928417,I’m a bit tired right now.Let the thread be open as long as people feel like posting about it.I think I started a thread where people can open about their experiences.I read it in the morning.Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ for support.

175928420,"Oh I’m sorry you have experience with it too. No I don’t live with my daughter. In fact when I moved here I left her behind, but she recently followed to be near me. I’m not happy about it either. I told her not to come but she didn’t listen. I can’t stop her from living here. You’re right distance is helpful, but she put an end to that by coming here. It’s her way of trying to get the upper hand again. But I’m not playing. So she’s pretty miserable. It’s so sad but I have my sanity to think of and Coronavirus to contend with. That’s good advice there with the protector wall and preparing myself for the pain, I wish I would have had that advice years ago. And the acting, OMG I’m finally to where I can start to see it, she’s so convincing though. Thank you for your words and your obvious experience on the matter. I hope you have support dealing with your family members too."

I love food too much so now I am just eating whatever and drinking wine and beer. I guess I have given up you can say. I might as well just be happy fat. Food is my only pleasure.

175928424,Weird question do any of you work and on this medication just for inspiration
175928425,"Thank you all for your responses!! HT - The comment about bipolar not showing affection doesn’t mean they don’t love you meant so much! Thanks for stating that. Needed to hear it! Any suggestions on how I could find a Dr that specializes in BP? Seems like all psychiatrists treat all the mood disorders, so don’t know how to find someone who actually specializes in BP. MainerMikeBrown - Zoloft is an SSRI antidepressant. It seems to be keeping my hubby in a constant manic state. I think as long as he stays on that, it keeps him from getting depressed but in a constant high. I hope you’re right about the love and affection returning once he’s in the right med combo. At least we are still intimate 1-2 times a week and during those times he’s pretty loving. It’s just that as soon as it’s over, affection is over too. _NAME_... it’s a little complicated medicating my hubby bc he’s a dentist and needs to have steady hands. Many of the mood stabilizers like lithium cause hand shaking. I t
hink that’s why his Dr. is trying the antipsychotics first that are less likely to cause that. My hubby’s mom takes lithium and it works well for her and it probably would for him as well, but she does have pretty bad hand shaking. The problem with him is that he enjoys being manic and didn’t want to be treated until I forced it by calling his Dr. Now I feel like he’s ok with a med as long as it doesn’t take away too much of the mania but just controls the outbursts. I’m having a problem with his Dr. I walked out of his appt last time because the Dr was really aggravating me. She said to me that Im judging my hubby’s Bipolar! All I was doing was telling her how he’s been behaving so she can properly treat his symptoms. I would never judge my husband especially that I deal with depression myself! She has me state all the things my husband does that I feel is out of his norm in front of him, which makes him upset and he lashes out at me. I really feel that I should tell her how he acts without m
y hubby present. It just causes unnecessary fights. He takes it as a criticism and he’s very sensitive to criticism in his manic state. All I want to do is tell the Dr accurately how he’s acting. He often denies behaviors bc he’s not always aware of how he acts, and his Dr listens to him and not me. Now we’re in a bad situation bc I don’t know when his next appt is and I really don’t want to deal with this Dr."
175928426,Tea and cigarettes.
175928427,I will have a book Tuesday
175928428,i wouldn’t worry too much about if you have sz or not. Just try to get your life together and keep taking your meds. I have had several diagnoses. I think they just try to identify what problems you have and then give it a name but that can change. My diagnosis changed several times over 15 years.
175928429,"Oh eeek. But still. They haven’t complained or asked you to stop so that’s good. But if it’s bothering you , there’s really no technical solution that would help. You just have to learn to be less reliant on this person I guess. Somehow."

I’ve already queried it on Google a few times and yesterday while I was waiting for music therapy to start at the recovery centre, I listened to Automatic for the People by R.E.M. While I know it’s one album I’ll be leaning on in the near future, I need something new and am almost finished listening to Young Prayer by _PERSON_ Bear. Keep in mind I’m also looking for something melodic and mellow with decent enough lyrics. I also might email a friend who’s a reference librarian at the central library here in Saint _NAME_ and ask what he might suggest."

175928436,You’re welcome! And thanks for the support you have given me. It has helped me for sure

175928443,"What a terrible therapist. I think you should look into getting a new one, It could really help you cope with your grief and get some of your delusions in check."
175928444,It’s not really anxiety. It’s like agitation/distress. “Just” anxiety would be welcome at this point as I can handle that. I drink coffee. Maybe I can see if cutting that down helps.
175928445,The subconscious is a powerful thing. And the voices are probably plugged into your subconscious. Your mind is aware of lots of things are aren’t your focus of conscious. Having said all that. It would still disturb me a bit if that was happening to me.
175928446,Hey peeps. My pdoc prescribed me 25mg promethazine as prn for sleep. Does or did anyone else here take it? It’ll be delivered to my home in a bit. I didn’t want to take quetiapine because it’s too weak for me and it also inhibits SERT. So… yeah. =P

I feel like I always have to go to a different place to read, watch a movie, listen to a podcast (Outside), anything.. My room is for bizarre thoughts of listening to music, sleeping, tripping, etc.. I feel trapped like I have to wait 1-2 years until I can move and get a bigger house so I can have my own study room or something.. But now it just feels wrong.. I feel claustrophobic.. Help???? How do I change my mindset to work with what I've got??"" Person: ""Well I guess you could say that you are more familiar with your room than any other place.

175928466,I took risperdone 5 years. 2x a day 3 mg morning and night. As for the half life… usually on the third day of no meds I’d start having ‘issues’
175928467,Yes that’s so true. As I grow I find my voices growing along side me. They already know certain things rather than me having to teach them. It’s so much easier now but that makes it harder to get rid of

I feel blessed about this although while I was taking olanzapine, I had no auditory hallucinations. I prefer Abilify because it has minor side effects as compared to olanzapine. It is a give and take situation. I am less sleepy and have less weight gain with Abilify but it is not 100 percent effective in taking away the voices. I deal with them when they come by continually taking Abilify."

My concern is I have a piece of food lodged in and will randomly start choking any idea how to tell difference I have had a full on food impaction, which means it will not clear the esophagus on its own. Not even saliva will go down. I never had a feeling of choking, just food being stuck. I had to be hospitalized for an emergency endoscopy to clear the blockage. That's a telltale sign of EOE, which was later confirmed through follow-up endoscopy and biopsy to see if eosinophils (which cause the throat to narrow) were present. It's a kind of allergic reaction to one or more foods like dairy, wheat, eggs, soy, peanuts/tree nuts and fish/shellfish. Below is an article explaining the condition you might find useful. But no doubt go to your doctor and speak about your symptoms. They might refer you to a specialist like an ENT who can check your throat in a simple office procedure.

So I’m applying to jobs. I hate days like this. Where it’s gloomy and I’m sad, at the same time. I want my love to be next to me. But he has to work. Tomorrow is supposed to be a sunny day but tomorrow for him to be here is not the same as home needing him for today. I always seem to think like that. Even with other people like my dad. _PERSON_ was in the shower and I was singing. Singing like I haven’t ever before in months. Maybe 2 years.

175928480,"Well, when a person starts believing the devil causes things to happen you are entering a world of psychosis and delusion imho. If you can’t let go of a theoretical philosophy and intellectualise it too far in that you apply it, thinking there won’t be consequences in the real world it could be a dangerous path. You are over thinking and ruminating needlessly and pointlessly. It serves no purpose in the real world where you eat, feel and sleep. Racing thoughts and hyper thinking are all signs of psychosis. Time to learn to meditate slowly and peacefully and slow those thoughts altogether. Perhaps, if you cannot function in the real world possessed with such thoughts then the meds might help. If the fabric of reality has become too blurred, don’t you think you are entering mania or other things of such ilk?"

She pushed me into af minor psychosis, i thought i was not existing anymore, like dead, or like I disappeared in to my self and couldn’t get out. At the ward, they measured my BAC test to 0.04 and even though i wasn’t drunk, the took away med meds (two AD’s) and gave me librium instead -because you cant mix my meds with librium… Now i’m back at work and the boss is very nice and shelter me from my colleague"

175928492,"The risk is very real, so ""sheltering in place"" is essential. But you can take walks in nature, away from people. That's the reality. Also, there are two kinds of people: those who want to be informed, truly up to the minute on breaking news; and those who are more stressed by it. For example, I have a brother with Parkinsons, and he doesn't want to read about it because it depresses him. But I have anxiety, and I try to read everything I can to get ideas for how to help myself. So I would figure out which kind of person you are, and limit or expose yourself to the news accordingly. Sometimes there are small realities that we blow up into major worries; this is not one of those times. This is a real threat. However, by paying attention to the advice of medical experts, you can act on your own behalf. You must limit exposure. That is the most important thing you can do. If you do that, you will help your anxiety, knowing that you did what's critical for your health and for that of others, especial
ly those with greater vulnerability. Secondly, you can use all the techniques you know of to calm yourself. Breathing, walking, nice and slow meal preparation, watching TV, talking on the phone or emailing. Writing is good. Give yourself a moment to write down your worst fears, and then try to stop yourself from dwelling on them. BTW, all that I'm telling you, I'm telling myself."

175928508,"I felt devastated, stupid and various other things when I admitted to myself I had been psychotic and delustion. Which come to think of it, doesn't sound good. However, I also thought about geing hopeful about getting help. Since I realized I had been unwell, I felt confident that I could talk about it with care providers. It was the first positivity. Now, I still feel inadequate experience the symptoms, but I would think about how lucky I was to acknowledge the unwellness, and proud to be strong enough to get treatment. I felt like I must actually be a strong person after all, and I had positive feelings around that. But, everyone is different and what I describe I certainly don't claim will help you. I do feel for you though, they were hard days for me when I first accepted it. Regards"

174335131,"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01124-8 Abstract The imbalance of prenatal micronutrients may perturb one-carbon (C1) metabolism and increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Prenatal excessive methionine (MET) produces in mice behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of human schizophrenia. Whether in-utero programming or early life caregiving mediate these effects is, however, unknown. Here, we show that the behavioral deficits of MET are independent of the early life mother-infant interaction. We also show that MET produces in early life profound changes in the brain C1 pathway components as well as glutamate transmission, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism. Bioinformatics analysis integrating metabolomics and transcriptomic data reveal dysregulations of glutamate transmission and lipid metabolism, and identify perturbed pathways of methylation and redox reactions. Our transcriptomics Linkage analysis of MET mice and schizophrenia subjects reveals master genes involved in i
nflammation and myelination. Finally, we identify potential metabolites as early biomarkers for neurodevelopmental defects and suggest therapeutic targets for schizophrenia. Introduction The necessity for a finely tuned one-carbon (C1) metabolism activity during pregnancy is supported by the role of micronutrients such as methionine, choline, vitamin B12, betaine, and folate in brain development through involvement in methylation processes1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. C1 metabolism encompasses two complex pathways, the transmethylation (methionine) and the folate cycles, through which a carbon unit is transferred from one to the other metabolic pathways. Dietary or supplementary methionine is converted to S -adenosyl-methionine (_NAME_), the main methyl donor that is used in almost all methylation reactions, where it is converted to S -adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) (Fig. 2d). SAH is converted to homocysteine (Hcy), a potent neurotoxin, which can then be recycled to methionine by receiving methyl group provided by the fola
te cycle. Methylation mediated through the C1 pathways is a universal reaction that plays a critical role in numerous biological processes and metabolic pathways that are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and other cellular functions10,11,12,13,14. Fluctuations in the methyl-donor dietary intake during pregnancy have been shown to cause changes in the components of the C1 pathways and in the levels of DNA methylation15."

175928526,"So we are into the second week of cold snowy-ish weather here in Kansas. Gotta say it is impacting my mood a bit more so than I had expected. I still do like it more. Just the list of inconveniences continues to build. Takes 20 minutes to get my car warmed up. That sets back all the small plan; grocery store runs the key among them. I don’t mind being cold. That part is refreshing. Unfortunately though, my brain doesn’t quite keep up with the mood end. I do miss having a sense of wider vista to explore. The association crops up when I step out side The intention to linger dwindles as the mind starts seeing feeding the impulse to return inside. Definitely different without the cigarettes. I hope you all are finding the transition comfortable and the winter isn’t too daunting by any means. Take care. I was just checking in. Stretching the fingers a bit."

175928530,"The reality is that the human brain and body are far too complex for humans to understand, so it is silly to say that we understand the capabilities of a specific brain and body. Humans don’t even understand that fruit fly brain that they took nanoscale images of yet. So, it is silly to say that just because one person can push through negatives, another person can. We just don’t have that level of understanding. The silliness doesn’t keep people from making such assertions though. This whole idea of using some ethereal willpower to accomplish anything appears to be just a silly fairy tale that was popularized by silly western movies. Sure, it is fun and crowd pleasing to watch _PERSON_ or someone win a contest mainly by willpower, but it is obviously just a silly movie. Some people are so conditioned by such fairy tales that they try to tell other people to just decide to use their willpower to power through things. That isn’t how it works in real life for many people. Movies aren’t real

174335144,"I mainly suffer from severe dissociation. When I drink energy drinks I think I get mild psychosis. It’s been an every day thing. It does something to me. Seems to be rare for people, but not for me. I have a strong, big heart. I don’t exercise because of the energy drinks, which is pretty stupid of me. I need to quit them. I only had hypnogogic hallucinations. Even when I was really ill and off meds I never hallucinated or heard voices, just had paranoia and dissociation. I wasn’t abused as a kid. I had a normal loving family. So I must have got the dissociation in college from trauma or my dad’s verbal abuse growing up, which looking back wasn’t that bad. People had it worse. My step-father was a jerk and neglected things. He used to ignore me growing up. When I’m severely dissociated from DP, I lack free will and think the universe is deterministic and I feel robotic. It has given me philosophical insight. It was horrible though and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. I’m going to try 
harder in life and quit them. I need to do something with my life. I decided I won’t ask for an increase in Strattera. I think it’s working enough and I’m doing well. So far, only positives for me. I often felt like a puppet on a string, literally. The caffeine increases the dissociation. Prior to 2015, one of my psychiatrists said she didn’t think I ever experienced or had psychosis. But she later changed her mind and backtracked. She said things changed. She gave me adderall at the height of my paranoia, which caused an emotional break from reality. At one point, she thought I had a severe personality disorder. Not sure which one. On online tests, I score high for avoidant personality disorder. It’s true. I avoid people when they piss me off and I get stressed out. I also don’t like conflict. I used to get intrusive thoughts, but not anymore thanks to prior supplement use and high dose of meds. I finally found the right cocktail of meds. I often think (my theory) that my schizophrenia is caused 
by a breakdown between realities. Basically, I think I remember things from other lives (have you seen Man in the High Castle?). It affects my thoughts, feelings, emotions, delusions, and behavior. I hypothesized delusions don’t exist because they come from parallel universes. But they have to be possible even if they are extremely unlikely. They have to obey the laws of physics. I’ve seen some weird ???? in my other lives like teleportation and ????. It’s possible, we just haven’t figured it out yet. It’s like other realities bleed through for me in this life. Sometimes when I am dreaming or awake. It’s bizarre but it has a quantum aspect to it. People don’t understand it but I think _PERSON_ talked about it. He’s a world renowend physicist who is also a futurist."

175928553,Your mind is playing tricks on you. The most likely explanation is that you saw a similar car and your delusional mind filled in the guy’s face.

174335128,"That’s a lot of meds. You should be tapering off with a doc’s help, if you’re really fixated on stopping. Ideally though you would remain on some level of antipsychotic. I’ve tried going off antipsychotics a few times, and each time I have a resurgence of voices, and each time I gain a little more appreciation for those lovely little antipsychotic pills. Right now I’m on 2 mg Rexulti, and the only noticeable side effect I have is it’s somewhat hard to breathe through my nose. You could also consider Amyloban 3399, a supplement that has helped a half dozen people on this forum further stabilize their schizophrenia (on top of taking antipsychotics). I used to take it, but I ran out. It was good while it lasted, made the voices so quiet."
175928555,"This study aimed to investigate the role of baseline levels of peripheral inflammation when testing the efficacy of antidepressant augmentation with minocycline in patients with treatment-resistant depression. We conducted a 4-week, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial of minocycline (200 mg/day) added to antidepressant treatment in 39 patients selected for elevated levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP ? 1 mg/L), n = 18 randomised to minocycline (M) and n = 21 to placebo §. The main outcome was the change in _NAME_ Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) score from baseline to week 4, expressed both as mean and as full or partial response, in the overall sample and after further stratification for baseline CRP?3 mg/L. Secondary outcomes included changes in other clinical and inflammatory measures. Changes in HAM-D-17 scores and the proportion of partial responders did not differ between study arms. After stratification for CRP levels <3 mg/L (CRP?) or ?3 mg/L (CRP+), CRP+/M patients showed 
the largest changes in HAM-D-17 scores (mean ± SD = 12.00 ± 6.45) compared with CRP - /M (2.42 ± 3.20, p < 0.001), CRP + /P (3.50 ± 4.34, p = 0.003) and CRP?/P (2.11 ± 3.26, p = 0.006) patients, and the largest proportion (83.3%, p = 0.04) of partial treatment response at week 4. The threshold point for baseline CRP to distinguish responders from non-responders to minocycline was 2.8 mg/L. Responders to minocycline had higher baseline IL-6 concentrations than non-responders ( p = 0.03); IFN? was significantly reduced after treatment with minocycline compared with placebo ( p = 0.03). Our data show some evidence of efficacy of add-on treatment with minocycline in MDD patients but only in those with low-grade inflammation defined as CRP ?3 mg/L. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-00948-6"

Actually people who are diagnosed with dementia can’t take most ap’s if any, it’ counterindicated because then they would really really lose their minds. I think it’s important to provide the brain with extra vitamins and other supplements to combat the degredation from the meds. I have really only been on zyprexa so I can’t speak for other medications. But I can definitly feel it’s taking it’s toll on me, but I imagine some ap’s are better than others in this regard.

175928647,"Minipuff: You are so calm! You need to give yourself a pat on the back for taking your medicine, and for calling into a help line for assistance. It was you that started that process and you that took it step by step all the way through for the last 3 months. You just stuck it out. You are quite a remarkable person. Did you learn any of that from your parents? There seems to be 2 situations: one is your child’s being home from school and trying to learn via a computer. The 2nd is, retraining your brain as you put it. I think they are both important but I think retraining you brain will help with that other, and also the 3rd situation of when someone bothers you, “Instead of getting upset or agitted, I’ve been trying to stop my brain and force it to think of something wonderful about that person and blessed I am to have them.” That’s positive thinking right there. You deserve a gold star. Going back to the woman who wrote the column on being positive, she said, “Believe in yourself—no 
matter what. If you believe you’ll be able to solve a problem, your chances of solving it double.” You said, “Retraining brain isn't as easy as I had hoped. When someone, does something that bothers me, instead of getting upset or agitted, I’ve been trying to stop my brain and force it to think of something wonderful about that person and blessed I am to have them.” You’ve already retained your brain. Class dismissed. (This is similar to your earlier post of your newly taken Buspar anti-anxiety medicine, that it needed to be increased, but then you backed out of that thinking. It turns out, you were right and that’s want did the trick for you. But your above positive thinking doesn’t back out, it carries through with the positive.) The following is the way I interpreted that above sentence about “Believe in yourself.” After I read the column in my daily newspaper, I thought. “this woman is reaching every part of my brain.” I thought, ""Put this column up on your bulletin board, and the 
next time you have a problem, get the column down and read it. The problem is not the problem, the problem is your negative thinking. Let the column clear your mind of negative thinking, and only then think of the problem.” A few days later, my teenage son came in and said, “The car won’t start. It’s in the back yard,” and walked out of the room. I thought, “I don’t know what to do, we have such a narrow driveway, how could a wrecker get in the backyard?” I then thought, “I’ll wait till my wife comes home from work and I’ll ask her what to do.” That is the thinking I had used all of my life, for that’s the way I had been taught since childhood. I then thought, “Wait a minute. Get down the column on being positive when trying to solve problems, and read it.” I got the column down. I put it on the bed in front of me. By the time I got to the 4th paragraph, still not having thought about the problem, I said, “_NAME_’s.” What was _NAME_’s? It was a garage up the street which 
had a small wrecker that was able to get into our narrow driveway and get a car out of our backyard a couple of years ago. Why hadn’t I thought of it before I read the column on being positive? My unconscious--hidden from me--was set on negative, to not find solutions, and was only obeying orders. It was set on negative because I had been taught since childhood, “You’re worthless. You can’t solve problems” And it had turned my hidden unconscious onto negative. As soon as I started to read the column on being positive going into a problem that you can solve it (“Think positive, think positive, think positive”), the switch flipped to positive and it opened up my unconscious to look for solutions, on its own, before I finished reading the 4th paragraph. You think you had a miracle. I had one, too. 1234"

175928651,Do you have other family members who can maybe help you confront him and get the abuse to stop? He sounds kind of like a bully. My parents hated each other after their divorce and never talked again but us kids were already in our twenties so we could see them separately and they had enough class so they didn’t bad mouth each other in front of us. But there was a lot of anger on both sides. Have you told your psychiatrist about this? If this guy is verbally abusing you or doing rotten things that you can’t handle then there’s no shame in getting help from someone. Your ex-husband needs to be taught that he can’t treat you badly. He needs to learn that he can’t take advantage of you and mistreat you.

The way the card ""fails"" is when it gets too hot and physically burns out. (You can see burn marks on it. The shiny ""gold"" plating on the underside of the micro SD will turn to a dull, non-shiny brown... sometimes even BLACK.) If you're using something like a Switch, that card is being read constantly and thus gets a little warm. The amount of heat a fake card can tolerate is much less than a legit card. And if you want to see for yourself (once you get a micro SD card), just play a game on Switch for an hour, turn off the S
witch, and right away open up the micro SD slot. You'll feel that the card is warm to the touch. A fake card would feel VERY hot, almost to the point it burns your fingers. I would say that you should only buy microSD cards from places like B&H, Best Buy, Target, and Wal-_NAME_ (but make sure on Wal-_NAME_ that the item says it's ""shipped and sold by Wal-_NAME_""). Also, Amazon has been having issues with people getting fake DualShock 4 controllers and Xbox One controllers, so I just buy from B&H or Best Buy instead. It may cost more money, but at least I know they're not fake. So I really avoid buying any kind of video game hardware from Amazon. I'll only buy games because other video game stuff is hit or miss with Amazon. Sometimes you get legit stuff, sometimes you don't."
175928719,Psychosis is seductive in that what you are experiencing makes sense and is real to you but not others. That is the problem as it’s usually quite obvious to everyone else. So. Yes. It attacks the core of your being/thoughts so for most it is helped by medications.

My electrolytes get checked every three month by my GP, there was never anything wrong with them. My kidneys are fine, my EGFR is 82 ( My age is almost 62), it was 71 when my diabetes was worse. I just had Yunnan green tea a pot, herbal tea from Lemon Balm and herbal tea from Sage, and two cups of black coffee."

175928725,"It takes a long time to lose 50 pounds. Trust me, I’ve done it. Also, you wouldn’t want to lose it fast. Generally (but not always) the longer the weight takes the come off the more likely you are to keep the weight off. This gives you time for your ‘habits’ (eating/exercising) to change. This is the worst part really. Changing habits is a really hard thing to do. Start slow. One other good thing is when you exercise it’ll release the ‘feel good’ chemicals in your brain. Exercise had changed my life."

175928732,I sit around a lot but I always just think about how nice life is. I sit outside and watch the bugs and leaves. Life around us is beautiful. We just have to learn how to appreciate it. When I first got out of the hospital I was suicidal. I kept thinking of different ways I would kill myself. But after some rest and time I kinda grew out of it. I just started playing guitar again. Taking pictures with my phone. Just little activities when I feel desperate throughout the day.
174335174,"This is really interesting. About half the people in their schizophrenia sample had high levels of ubiquitin. The researchers identified 20 brains of schizophrenic people that had more proteins and that were not able to dissolve in detergents, consequently. In comparison to the healthy brain controls, ubiquitin, a small protein, indicated that there’s protein buildup in neurodegenerative conditions. It was also found to be at an alarming level. Even if that is just a contributing factor in half the cases, how great would that be if they could target it."

What I actually believe is that schizophren
ia is caused by low amounts of gaba valproic acid increases gaba in the brain been doing research since 2016 when I was diagnosed. By the way the doctor prescribed me 300 mg valproic acid in the morning and 300 mg at night I have been symptom free since August 2018 that’s ten months maybe someone else can recommend valproic acid to your doctor it worked for me and by the way I’m on no antipsychotic I stopped taking aripiprazole when I noticed it did nothing till they gave me valproate"

174335176,"Is leaving a family home where you struggle a good idea? I am aware that there is a system to help with costs of rent upkeep and I believe I qualify for this: As a student it is possible for me bc I am registered as disabled on a particular registry. I won’t name for personal reasons. Basically, my two side of situation is. In my home, I cannot get along with parents due to friction in a)belief in the condition of schizophrenia or psychotic disorder being either non existence or daily questioned b)remarks or judgement due to academic failings and previous history of substance use and c) “personality or behaviour” I think first two are fair. They were educated in a different culture, one which is foreign to the uk - which makes it logical for them to be like this. From where I stand. There’s no intention to empathise (i am not asking for sympathise) with sz/psychotic disorder’s effects I deal with. I have tried to do my part as otherwise “disabled”, I have contributed financially, not 
out of force ofc. I have regularly helped when in a position to do so over the years, maybe not so much with direct utility, but through other means. In fact. The effort I put into one of the younger siblings, gets suggested to be bad influencing or jeopardising. A direct complaint that I am supposedly ruining or potentially inviting ruin. Idk. I would strongly disagree, all I am doing is helping independent thinking and better grasp for real world situations. Something I did not have growing up and did not receive from _NAME_ siblings, neither either parent - As much as you’d expect so at least. The result is obvious. This sibling, has good grasp of friendships he maintains, he’s created a study habit or ethic, he’s engaged new hobbies (much funded by me, truth) and then he’s also doing his own “life planning” and exploring through resources available to realise his tastes and wants in life The influence as far as I can tell, this is what an older brother does. And In this case, I’d even boast 
I’ve been doing it really well, within reason The likely location would be a town roughly 20/40 minutes away from this one. This would (for now) be temporary. I would do it for as long as I am still a student at university. I just want to be able to get the grade I need to get into a doctorate programme for economics; I feel leaving would be a way to bolster my mental state to fight towards the goal?"

175928754,"For me paranoia and delusions are worse than voices. Paranoia meant that I was in fear and on adrenaline 24/7 and couldn’t sleep or relax, I was tense. Delusions like believing that I am Jesus almost killed me as I tried to kill myself to prove that I am immortal Jesus."

175928766,"They do the same thing for guys, at least in my experience. Here’s some of the medical “advice” I’ve gotten when I bring this issue up with my pdocs. “Maybe your problems are psychological.” “You just need to get some more confidence.” “Why don’t we try increasing the dose.” - yeah because more of this ???? is going to get things moving and not just make it worse. And then they wonder why you have passive suicidal ideation, amotivation and anhedonia. And if you have severe aniexty issues, they’ll give you some babyshit vistral, instead of something that actully does something. I’ve basically had to strong arm my way into getting med changes multiple times. And I’d say more than 80% of the time, the issues have gotten better within a week of switching. Anyone else ever feel like a hot potato when your at your pdoc appointment? Its like they care more about keeping you pacified then actually fixing any of your issues. I think I need to find a new clinic instead of ???????? 
about it. ???? this disease. _USER_ID_: Almost forgot, they’ll offer to give you Viagra instead of running a hormone pannel to see if you have any endocrine problems."

175928773,"Okay, now I’m almost certain that that was a slight. I didn’t ask you to justify anything that you said, and I don’t expect you to justify anything that you said. All I did was ask if I was reading too much into things, being paranoid, because at this point, I’m not sure. It’s just fishy to me that recently, I’ve felt that that most everyone I’ve interacted with is being passive aggressive, facetious, or blatantly rude and mean. It can’t be everyone, can it? The issue is clearly in my mind. Sometimes. Because people really do act this way. Everyone acts this way. How do I remain impartial when taking in information? Because right now, I’m seeing everything through paranoid eyes."

174335185,"That I have it. Diagnosed at age 19 in 1980. I hate to be depressing but at age 24 I realized I will have it forever, it will never go away. Up until then I just kind of unconsciously thought that it was like any other illness and that if I took my medication and followed what my family and doctors told me that I would get better. Well, I’m 59 now and it has gotten better but it still effects me in everyday life and a cure would be nice but I’m not counting on it. I’ve learned certain things and one thing is that I learned that having schizophrenia was not the end of the world. I learned I could still get something out of life, that I could do stuff like travel, work, live independently, have some fun and have cool experiences. I leaned that life ain’t hopeless and solid suffering. I felt that way early on, maybe the first several years, and as life went on I still had bad symptoms but I could still have friends and have fun and hang out."

175928807,I don’t trust anyone at all anymore. Only my family. I’ve felt like Jesus or one of the disciples in that I was betrayed by Judas. Not saying I’m delusional or anything. I just think it’s my illness and possibly warranted given that I was messed with really bad. It’s probably typical. I’m a good guy. I messed up a few times and had problems with my judgement temporarily. I think I got some damage to my brain (SZA) and symptoms of frontal lobe impairment like poor executive functioning. I also have Aspergers.

Over time since then (13 years or so) Ive slowly gained more and more weight to the point where I’m now 18 stone (250 pounds). Even in the last 5 years or so I’ve gone up a _NAME_ size once, and if Im honest I need to go up a _NAME_ size again to wear comfortable clothing. I just dont know what to do. I don’t feel like I really eat that much food or have any crazy habits. I eat a fair bit of chocolate here and there but not every day or even every week. I don’t munch or crisps or drink soda. Every time I get hung up on it I look at fad diets. It worked once before for me where I cut out all carbs and lost a _NAME_ size or two. But I don’t think they are really realistic long term. I don’t really do any exercise at all, and Im sitting down through most days. My mum suggested that because Im not active I need to eat considerably less than most people do. Maybe only eat twice a day. I might 
start doing that. Some part of me wants to stop taking my medications because Im so overweight I can’t stand it. I definitely eat less when I get depressed. And anti psychotics and anti depressants are both meant to cause weight gain generally."

Toxic effects begin to occur at doses above 10–20 mg/kg of elemental iron. Ingestions of more than 50 mg/kg of elemental iron are associated with severe toxicity.[9] A 325-mg tablet of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate has 65 mg (20%) of elemental iron

175928869,"Hello, I am so sorry to hear about your father. We’re here for you – you’re not alone! It would be very traumatic to live with someone so unwell, especially when it’s so often that he is. I am very impressed that you are so strong, it can be very emotionally draining to live with someone like that, I am very proud of you. It’s understandable that you would worry that cancer has returned, and likewise worry about his health and if it would be life-threatening. Just a question – does he agree to go to the doctor and get it checked out? This would relieve some of your anxiety, to know everything’s ok, to get to the bottom of why he’s in so much pain. It must be so hard to feel this way so often, and I’m really glad you reached out. If you’re from the US, you can text ‘hey’ or ‘hello’ to the crisis line, 741741. I have the number to text for a few other areas of the world as well – not sure where you’re from! But it connects you to a professional, a textline counselor. T
his would help you to be able to remain calm until you can see your counselor again. My other suggestion is to do things to relieve the anxiety you have. Things like praying for your father (if you’re spiritual), meditating, having a bath with a bath bomb, using some essential oils in a diffuser, listening to calming instrumentals, do some journaling, just to name a few. Things that relax the tension that you’re feeling. I’m glad you reached out – it’s been weighing on you for too long. I highly recommend talking about this to your counselor when you next see her – I’m not sure what the circumstances are, but the stress and worry of his health is affecting your sleep, focus, productivity and your overall health. Using Inspire is definitely a good way to go. It shows how strong you are to reach out like this. We’re all here for you, keep strong – you’ve got this!"

175928890,"I wrote this before about two months ago to you. I was in the same boat you are in now when it came to women when I was 19. I was 19 with schizophrenia and I believed a 100% that I would never date and never have sex. Women just seemed so unapproachable to me. I didn’t think I was desirable either. I got put in my first psyche ward. I’m not sure what happened but there was this 26 year old blond woman I liked. She knew I liked her and one night I was alone in the kitchen and she approached me and next thing I know we were making out. We heard somebody coming so we split up. Later I was in the gym alone and she came in and we talked and then she kind of invited me to have sex with her. Me! The guy who never said two words to any girl in high school! I was average looking at my best. Anyways, we came about as close to having sex that you could be but a nurse walked in and broke it up. I still talked to the woman when ever we passed in the hall but we never had sex. I’m not going to give you my 
whole sexual history in all it’s glory (I’m being sarcastic) but I moved into a group home and a couple months later I lost my virginity to this 22 year old, hardcore Mexican woman in the home. She was a knockout, built like a brick you-know-what. But I want to make a point that one cool thing about women is there’s always women out there who will give you a chance. I’ve run into them in my life and seen it in other guys lives too. If you are half way decent and nice and you treat them decently there’s a good chance you’ll find some woman who will give you a chance and talk to you and eventually, you may get a date out of it. If you’re looking strictly for sex, there’s a possibility of that too, I had fun doing it but it was largely unsatisfying. Anyways, I’m not setting myself up as some worldly expert on women and sex. But some things are obvious. If you act like an ass to women you are not going to get very far with them. Man, when I was 19 I thought about sex all the time. At age 60 I ha
ve many other things besides sex on my mind. But to get back to my point, yeah, despite many handicaps besides schizophrenia I was so sure I would never have sex or a girlfriend. But somehow I dated a little and later when I lived with my sister she had a circle of friends and I never dated any of them they still tolerated me and a couple even liked me and my sister is an extravert and very social and she went out almost every night with her friends or invited them over to talk and hang out and I was included in most things. I kind of took it for granted way back then but thinking back, considering how I grew up, that was huge to be hanging out with all these women. And I haven’t dated in years but the women at work are friendly and respectful and I enjoy making small talk with them and getting along with them. You’ll find some woman who likes you for some reason when you least expect it. I mean as you age you will just be around women more just by being alive. And you’ll learn about them and see that t
hey just want what men want. They want to be liked and treated with respect and have fun. You can’t help but learn about women after you are around them as you get older. You don’t have to trick them or have cheesy, corny pick up lines. Just be yourself. You don’t have to bed a lot of women, you can just find one you like and get to know her and things will develop naturally from there."

Latina/o is a term that means anyone from Latin America, not sure where it came from originally as a word. Latinx is an all gender-inclusive term that means anyone from Latin America. Chicana is a term that means she/her who was born in america of mexican descent, and usually they are familiar with the chicano movement and/or chicano culture. mexican-american is another way of saying chicana, minus the cultural context. it usually means a mexican born in america, but now and then you’ll hear it as a mexican who has become a us citizen. generally, it refers to family descent, not what language you speak. my cousins and i all grew up with my mexican, spanish speaking grandparents, but only i speak any spanish, still we are all Latinx, or whatever 
they call themselves. a lot of the terms are mostly created by the us gov for stuff like forms and taking the census, except for chicana/o/x, which was actually a slur used at one point by mexicans for mexican-americans they didn’t think were mexican enough. those same mexican-americans reclaimed the word and made it a positive identity for themselves."

I just have to remind myself of how stressed out I used to be. I did make it. It doesn’t feel quite like I wanted, but it’s there. Waited 3 years for it. I forget that covid has totally altered my semi-out-and-about lifestyle. That’s probably something I should remind myself about more. It’s also been 90 + degrees Fahrenheit for about a month every day. America is in _USER_ID_ no doubt. But I’m still well employed and being in the second most depopulated region of the US does stage us to dodge quite a few of the bullets zinging around in the American gumption. All sorts of ???? I’ve never seen have all occurred this year. 
Purely madness. It isn’t all bad though. There is a lot of very difficult but positive movements occuring. Covid just reminds me of how globalized we are becoming. I mean it’s a unifying factor regarding human experience… The whole world will remember this together… And that’s machevellian but… At least there is a silver lining. The unified experience inherent dissipates the notions of overt incompatibility. All in all it’s just a strange time to be alive. I love you all… I’m out here hacking it the best I can I want to encourage you all to keep trucking with it. My positive symptoms are still with me at all times… Like my brain is a dirty kaleidescope at all times… Muck and weird colors… But I know it’s just my illness. My imagination works just fine these days. Used to have to miss that… Just being able to see what I was thinking about in a while. I don’t think the presence of the illness will ever go away… But I can actually like just chose when I want to force myself to sle
ep. I can invoke my own sense of peace with things when I need. … I don’t feel ?????? out of life like I used to since the first break. Progress can be found and its worth fighting for. I’m hoping the best for you. The worlds and population at large all have their problems… We get overlooked… But I’m thankful for each one of you being in this existence with me… Cause I could not have gotten as far I have if I was left with nothing but the trap of feeling like I was the only one. I think we’re just temporally displaced. Born to the wrong kind of time… Cause this world sucks… And it’s hella stubborn… And somehow it’s entirely in love with itself at the same time. Total ????????… Sorry that last bit was too proclamative to go without being labeled with the “delusional beliefs”… I only mean it as an exagerrated portrayal to sort of demonstrate my emotion sense of things… As I peril on through the ongoing tide of mishmash that is global assininity. Take care y’all"

174335220,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Real-time fMRI feedback impacts brain activation, results in auditory hallucinations reduction: Part 1: Superior temporal gyrus -Preliminary evidence. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, C de Los Angeles, _NAME_, EC _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research, Feb 2020 10 Auditory hallucinations (AH) are one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ) and constitute a significant source of suffering and disability. One third of SZ patients experience pharmacology-resistant AH, so an alternative/complementary treatment strategy is needed to alleviate this debilitating condition. In this study, real-time functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging neurofeedback (rt-fMRI NFB), a non-invasive technique, was used to teach 10 SZ patients with pharmacology-resistant AH to modulate their brain activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), a key area in the neurophysiology of AH. A functional task was designed in order to provide patients with a specific strategy to 
help them modify their brain activity in the desired direction. Specifically, they received neurofeedback from their own STG and were trained to upregulate it while listening to their own voice recording and downregulate it while ignoring a stranger's voice recording. This guided performance neurofeedback training resulted in a) a significant reduction in STG activation while ignoring a stranger's voice, and b) reductions in AH scores after the neurofeedback session. A single, 21-minute session of rt-fMRI NFB was enough to produce these effects, suggesting that this approach may be an efficient and clinically viable alternative for the treatment of pharmacology-resistant AH."

175928953,"I've been in therapy most of my adult life. For most of that time I've gone twice a week. I've struggled to understand why I feel the way I do. It is hard for me to believe that it's because of my childhood. My parents were in my eyes better than everyone else. They always communicated that to us as we were growing up. And told us how lucky we were to have parents that put us first. So I'm convinced that there is something wrong with me. My therapist says that my parents were neglectful. My father was an orphan and raised himself. He was not able to share his emotions or love and nurture me. He had to be the top dog. My mother was just not there emotionally. She wasn't even aware that she lacked in that area. They adored my older brother. He was a cute red headed little boy that got a lot of attention from people when we were growing up. And to my parents our family's appearance to the outside world was very important. I was more awkward. I tried to be popular like my brother and father so that I c
ould get attention too. But I usually just ended up making a fool of myself and feeling like a jerk. I felt (feel) horribly inadequate. My parents either also saw me as inadequate or just were unaware. They couldn't help me. They couldn't provide a loving and nurturing home. But there was no physical or sexual abuse (although my therapist suspects that there may have been sexual abuse). Sometimes I think it might have been better if they had hit me. At least that way I could see that they were doing something wrong. Instead I have a really hard time believing it's not just that I'm an inferior shit of a person. I wanted to post to this community because I have a very difficult time around people. Either because I am shit or because of my childhood. My mind can't decide which is true. I was invited to a co-workers house for Thanksgiving. I was afraid to go because when my ""issue"" arises I get very awkward and make everyone around me feel uncomfortable. My therapist says it's a kind of PSTD - that some situat
ions can make me feel like I did as a child. I never feel OK around people but some situations can be worse than others. I can't describe how horrible that feels when it happens. My mind and the struggles with people have made it so that I live a life without people. I'm devastated and am not sure that a life without people and relationships is tolerable or worthwhile. So I'm posting to this site in the hopes that I might create - at least online - some contact with people and make my life feel a little more worth living. If anyone knows any chat groups or sites or any other ways to initiate some online contact with people I would love to hear about them. Thanks, _PERSON_"

Having been bullied and ostracized as a young kid, I became obsessed with social status as a teenager. As a young adult, I definitely had AvPD traits, but they went away. The push-pull effect regarding other people that exists in AvPD and SPD is, I think, similar and dissimilar at the same time. I think schizoids bury their feelings whereas people with AvPD retain their emotionality so they obsess over how they perceive others think of them. My latest dx is a mixture of schizoid, narcissistic and OCD-PD traits."

Adults didn't even talk to me about philosophical things - Except this one time my friends and I talked about how we didn't believe in God..

Don’t rely on others, and don’t rely on gym memberships or buying equipment or any of the other common shortcuts. Those are all terrible ways of starting out. You can’t bribe yourself and you can’t rely on external motivators. Also, don’t reward yourself after a workout.

175929011,"The effort to populate the new world was a succes… Nobody really knows how many people live in South America, since there is a need to emphasize their cultural values when they describe why they are succesfull in sports or have a stable economic system. What we know however is taht there are some megacities down there. Try to watch the amssive buidings and cheer size of the city. It must have taken its toll on its population and cost many man hours. See Sao Paolo for your self: There are so many big buildings but the city isnt bustling with life in the sense that asian cities are. There however a well developed public transport system with busses and trains that make people get around quicker. There definately is a ghost city feel over it, whoch could be explained by its perhaps over ambitious construction policies following the rise of global capitalism in the 80's. _PERSON_ proves that you need to actually stop and consider people first I believe. Anyway heres a video of the traffic there. I do
nt know much about the night and streetlife of Sao Paolo but I will add a video to show you that the ambitions to populate this city certainly shows in the nightlife. _PERSON_ is so unbelievably big, and unlike anything I have seen in Europe or Asia. It must have taken a lot of planning but it isnt really what we know from videos from Brazil. It must be the worlds best kept secret megacity and even the inspiration for the city of _NAME_ in the movie Matrix I believe. It is so because I believe the city is an attempt to create a big civilization there, but I doubt that these houses are actually occupied. Im gonna post a linkt to craigslist Sao Paolo if anyone wants to join the the Brazilians in their effort to become a economic superpower, or simply want a bit of fun at the beach: New Condo 500$ Only I would like to go to Brazil, and maybe should have instead of The Philippines. This seems to be the ideal destination for a holiday for me, but in the mean time Im just going to be in Scandinavia. One of the good 
things about Brazil is the way they look at their bodies. they are really physical and unlike asians interested in actually dancing and doing things. Its also a really gay friendly destination. There is however also conservative values, which I know from a friend in Mexico. Thats why I included this tweet from someone I know in the lesbian community: *On my first year in UP, I was so in denial w/ myself to the point that I joined in a religious org that promotes heteronormativity. * Funny how this institution has its own set of extremes. I’m just rly glad that I learned to embrace my truth. ?:?? PM - ?? ??????????, ???? Sunken Garden ???? ""Cuban LGBT activists defy government, hold unprecedented indie pride parade"" Some higher-quality screencaps -- that's definitely a trans pride flag I really like this expression of the LGBTQI envoriment because they remind me of my jewish grandmother . The girl in the picture above is someone I met online who also reminds me a great deal of a filipina woman I met in the 
philippines. I was a student in the Philippines and still have friends on facebook from that country. the Philippines is really a tolerant country for the most part. When I came back I actually experienced hate crimes from muslims because they saw me as a homosexual. Well everythings relative, and they just wanted to exploit me. I guess anti gay movements are still the problem with Turkey and the arab world perhaps including Japan and Malaysia. I used to be overweight because psychiatry forced me to get female pregancy hormons, which they told me were relaxing pills. Look at these people who take pride in going from obese to fat."

Wildflecken, Germany, and the rest of Germany were heartbreakingly beautiful, the Colorado Rockies is very beautiful, except that they’re too prone to forest fires, the Ozarks have a lot of beauty, my friends and I used to go backpacking there every Spring and every Fall, the Grand Canyon is awesome. I’d like to see the giant Sequoya trees before I die, and I’m thinking about going sight seeing in Europe before I kick the bucket."
175929017,"As someone who struggles with depressing thoughts and the ability to function on a regular basis I'd like to share a bit of advice. Try changing your mindset. I know it's hard, and it won't happen over night, but make yourself lists and give yourself an attainable due-date for them. Then set up milestone rewards. For example: Sunday morning make a list of 12 things you want to do by the end of the week. Each day, try your best to do two of them. Don't do them for anyone else, do them for yourself. For example: ""clean the livingroom"" could be one for Sunday as well as ""start a new book"". If you do those two things on Sunday, take a relaxing bath at the end of the day. At the end of the week on Saturday if you get everything done throughout the week that you wanted to, get yourself something small you've been wanting or buy yourself lunch (it counts if you finish your list ON Saturday, that's your catch up day). When you do little things to appreciate yourself, you'll start to feel better about y
ourself."
175929018,"I just share my ideas, I don’t encourage anyone. It’s obvious. I don’t understand the censorship"
175929019,I pay $4 per month per prescription so $12 total but I’m on all generic older medications. Newer name brands my insurance “might” cover up to 50% but for something like Vraylar that would still be like $600 a month(oh and they actually don’t cover Vraylar at all so that’s great) but if we add the cost of my insurance plan my employer pays about $550 a month and I pay about $60 of that. American healthcare sucks. If you qualify for Medicaid that’s great but then your choice of providers is so small and your wait lists are way too long.
175929020,this is frowned upon on this forum. We’re not fodder for you.
175929021,"I’m stressed. My landlord, who is also my moms fiance, bitched at me today for not working and just sitting around all day doing nothing. I have never missed rent once but that doesnt satisfy him. He wants me working. I have a hard time holding jobs due to my mental illnesses."

175929025,I’m lucky. Many middle aged people with chronic mental health issues in the UK don’t have that support . The input of family is so important in ensuring a person gets an adequate/good level of help and support . 30 years or so since the care in the community approach began we still don’t have a system fit for purpose . Long term lack of adequate funding hasn’t helped .
175929026,I might try sleeping in the chair tonight. Might be easier for me to breathe sitting up
175929027,"Thanks _PERSON_, I’ve always have had a psychiatrist and have had several psychiatrist. It has been off & on. I’ve been through 2 divorces, I strive for protection, caregiver and people pleaser. In August I had a change in companies and issues transition because of my old employer. And as a people please, I’ve been under a lot of stress. Then this Covid19 and my parents have compromised health issues. I been taking care of them, was working from home and when there was office hours I’d have to go in. Then furloughed on 4/3 and I’ve been spiraling out of control. I think the change to my routine, hearing about all the cases and deaths, caring for my parents, my family.... I’m sorry to ramble on..."
175929028,Are you willing to try to overcome the feeling that it was real? To learn to accept that it was part of the sz?
175929029,I don’t have much med side effects right now either. Just negatives and cognitive symptoms.
175929030,"Town pop is 5500, with a fairly dense pop in the surrounding area. The town even has a hospital and mental health clinic like the city i lived in. However im not sure if its because of my flat affect, lack of emotional IQ, and/or everybody been talking…but i think people dont like me. They act like they want me out of their town. Idk, people i dealt with in the city were very friendly. Worried they’ll slash my tires because i dont know how socially F’d i am. Thoughts?"

175929035,"I oscillate with this “offense” of mine and it’s weak of me. I guess I just got hurt by girls in my lifetime! And it’s harder for a male to say… which sounds fair in my mind; and bare minimum it’s raw; and reactionary of me, which I view as a boon on most occasions."
174335260,"Academics got worse due to negative and cognitive issues. No carrier, no job. Negative symptoms is a slow poison."
174335257,"So using this doctors theory, the millions of people who had (or have) psychosis for months or even years since schizophrenia was first recognized, it was all just one big illusion? Damn, I spent 8 months in the hospital because of something I made up? Silly me, my mistake."
175929036,"I don’t know what makes my mom so upset with these things but I rub my hands repetitively a lot. I also rock back and forth but I mask it a lot because my mom would be like “stop that!” I just mask myself constantly because I’m afraid of someone pointing it out, and I’m so ashamed that I can’t make eye contact with people. I’ve been so ashamed of these things ever since I was younger. Should I do these things- like anything I try to hide? Is it a good thing I do these things? Or is it something I should hide?"
175929037,I think many of us feel overmedicated But going off meds can be disaster unfortunately What medicine do you Wanna quit with?
175929038,"They’re men in the neighborhood. Why they’re obsessed with me, I have no idea. I’m pretty sure, they’re younger than my daughter. Unless they’re speaking on behalf of another stalker. They are always trying to brainwash me. I went out with someone 3 years ago. People started telling lies about it. I don’t know if it’s him. He knows I wouldn’t have gone out with him, if it was the situation everyone’s lying about. Now people act like I’m someone’s property. I know it’s not the guy I went out with, because he’d be calling me."
174335253,"Try Latuda? I heard that its best for cognitive symptoms, I was able to work full time a low stress job while on it. I stopped it bcz I had some positive symptoms on it but maybe you won’t. I was on Abilify for 8 years but could never work more than 1 month."

175929040,Nothing at the moment but i have only been taking it for 1 year and some months i hope it doesnt do that.
175929041,"The world is a dangerous place, I often get friendly laughs at work because I’m so naïve. I say my stupid jokes to my supervisor for example who spent 4 years in the Vietnam war and a total of 15 years in the marines. He’s a good sport most of the times and doesn’t take me too seriously. I’m a late bloomer but I’ll catch on."
175929042,Yeah I took it for a decade when I was Bipolar but we’re thinking it might not be good for the hallucinations. Really hoping I can tolerate it though because it was an important part of what got me out of bed in the morning… I was on it all through college and I didn’t smoke.
174335254,"Nobody has a right to know. But a good idea would be to wait until a sense of trust is established, and then tell them. Like I said, nobody has a right to know, but keeping it from a partner isn’t fair on either of you. They should be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they can/want to handle it"

175929044,"Oh I would full well prefer someone to get help as soon as possible, even if it without the click. Maybe they can find it along the way. At least I hope they do. In my case, I knew what I was, addict madman. But I also didn’t care, I didn’t care to live or die, nor did I care about the destruction I caused. For me personally, my recovery didn’t truly start until I had that fire inside of me, that click"

174335264,Just to give different perspective. I was on clozapine for a year. I slept most of the time upwards of about 15 hours a day. I drooled. My mood was ok on it during waking hours. Constant blood work. Its worth a shot. It can be really helpful for some people although know about different side effects could help you make an informed decision about commencing treatment.

174335273,I didn’t agree with my diagnosis in 2016 either. So I went unmedicated. I felt good for the most part. When I would drink I would talk about everything being fake like I was in a movie or something. I lost a few jobs due to paranoia and just up and quitting. Finally this year I had another really bad bout of psychosis that ended up with me on disability and living at home with my parents. Schizophrenia is not something to mess around with. If you have trouble accepting you have it you need to find some way to deal with it. It took me a while but it’s better once you recognize you have it

Apart from that my thoughts are not racing and I’m not paranoid. What could this be?"
175929116,I showed up to an appointment with a clinician and there was an ambulance waiting for me. I go to the mental facility and I guess the governor signed something that forced me to take injections of Risperdal. There is a chance it will happen to you if you quit your meds.

Personally, I never hear voices or hallcuinate. I just have unsual beliefs too that no one believes. I just call them delusions. I’ve been beat down over time by many folks even here who say I’m delusional. Hell, I even had an idiot doctor say I heard voices even though I did not. He said I hallucinated too. Gave me NMS.

174335290,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Cytokine hypothesis of schizophrenia pathogenesis: evidence from human studies and animal models. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences , Jun 2010 The pathogenesis of schizophrenia has yet to be fully characterized. Gene-environment interactions have been found to play a crucial role in the vulnerability to this disease. Among various environmental factors, inflammatory immune processes have been most clearly implicated in the etiology and pathology of schizophrenia. Cytokines, regulators of immune/inflammatory reactions and brain development, emerge as part of a common pathway of genetic and environmental components of schizophrenia. Maternal infection, obstetric complications, neonatal hypoxia and brain injury all recruit cytokines to mediate inflammatory processes. Abnormal expression levels of specific cytokines such as epidermal growth factor, interleukins (IL) and neuregulin-1 are found both in the brain and peripheral blood of patients with s
chizophrenia. Accordingly, cytokines have been proposed to transmit peripheral immune/inflammatory signals to immature brain tissue through the developing blood-brain barrier, perturbing structural and phenotypic development of the brain. This cytokine hypothesis of schizophrenia is also supported by modeling experiments in animals. Animals treated with specific cytokines of epidermal growth factor, IL-1, IL-6, and neuregulin-1 as embryos or neonates exhibit schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities after puberty, some of which are ameliorated by treatment with antipsychotics. In this review, we discuss the neurobiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia and novel antipsychotic candidates based on the cytokine hypothesis."

Participants newly diagnosed as schizophrenia were defined as incidents. _PERSON_ regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the schizophrenia incidence rate between the two studied groups.Results: PC
OS patients were at increased risk of incident schizophrenia compared to non-PCOS controls after adjusting for age, CCI score, comorbidities, and different treatment options (0.49 versus 0.09 per 1000 person-years, HR: 6.93, 95% CI: 3.25-14.7). After adjusting for above-mentioned covariates, metformin treatment had a protective effect against the incident schizophrenia compared to non-users (HR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.06-0.41).

Now SO usually notices earlier than I would’ve on my own and helps me not spiral so much. I still loved it though because I could do whatever I wanted. I struggle with OCD and so I don’t often slack with housekeeping things like cleaning or bills. It’s a good thing because I am on top of things. But also frustrating at times because sometimes my fingers crack and bleed from all the compulsive cleaning. I am better about it now that SO lives with me. TLDR: I like living alone very much but it requires a lot of work to stay on top of things. My mental health is better now that I have someone to share my home with.

175929260,"I used to have olfactory and tactile hallucinations as a child. I would smell things that others didn’t smell all the time. Food smelled bad, people smelled bad… at one point I couldn’t eat, I always covered my nose with my palms to not smell things or I would hold my breath. I was so scared of the olfactory hallucinations for some reason. I would also perceive random smells, aromas and scents/fragrances. I also would feel things like insects crawling on me or strange sensations as well. I had problems sleeping at night too. I would hear sounds and have really bad and evil thoughts only at night. I knew something was weird because I was the only one at home who had issues with sleeping."

I broke my diet yesterday and had hot chips from Kentucky fried chicken because my boyfriend bought us a big pack each for lunch. Hope that doesn’t make me put weight back on. I hope I will lose this last weight in a healthy way and that it won’t take long. I don’t eat that much in my opinion and I’m vegan and exercise a lot. I work hard for it and think the results should be better than they are. Back at it! Love n good wishes to us.

174335321,It’s rare but not unheard of to self diagnose schizophrenia. Most of us go psychotic and end up in emergency or in other situations. Saying that. Family history can be indicating things but it’s not everything. People here have no family history and still get schizophrenia. As previously stated. If your losing function it’s worthwhile seeking treatment. Medications can help anxiety and depression and make a big difference. We aren’t in the position to diagnose and although we have many similarities in our journeys you need a doctor to have these conversations and a psychiatrist is that.

Now the longest stay is 28 days, and most commitments are much shorter than that. I believe the atypical antipsychotics should get the credit for this because people tolerate them so much better than the typicals. If they were going to put me on Haldol again I don’t think I could face it. I would rather live on the street in wintertime with a bad case of pneumonia than take Haldol again."

An uncontrollable need for love is probably the single thing that makes most victims. I had a pretty strong need for love, but at the age of 60 I outgrew it. I’ve also seen people who had an uncontrollable need for love not be able to grow up, because they couldn’t figure out how to get the love they wanted. Sometimes they don’t ever outgrow it. If you want a relationship look for ways to meet good people. Maybe at church. Maybe at art classes. Maybe in a literature discussion group. Maybe in a twelve step group.

But if you're ever feeling hopeless, don't be afraid to reach out. You can always call the suicide hot line. They will talk to you anytime and listen to what you have to say.

175929402,_AT_MENTION_ I grew up in the Bible Belt of the American South. There were no black kids in my elementary school and 3 total in our middle and High schools.

They intermingled until you have lots of black Lumbees today!

175929432,"I'm not going to pretend that I haven't had a big hand in the problems I face these days. I've been a fool, a dumbass, and many, many other names I call myself in the dark of night. But those problems were personal, easy even. These days, the things that vex me are others' problems, things I have no control over. Things I cannot change without hurting those I love. I am the sole caretaker for both of my parents. They are in their 70's, and both are health compromised. My dad had a major heart attack six years ago. He spent over 20 hours on a surgical table, and had almost every artery in his heart bypassed. (It's called a 5CABG if you want to look it up.) I stayed with him while he was recovering from the operation. His kidney function has made it up to barely low normal, and the docs called it a great victory. He's got diabetes and complications from Agent Orange in Vietnam. If it wasn't for the VA, he would be dead. Of course, that meant a year of listening to him complain about how he wished he 
had died on the surgical table, and his regrets and failings as a father. My mother, well, she's more complicated. In so many ways, she is just broken. She used to be an administrator in a children's psych hospital. She made good money, has a good retirement, and did a lot of good. But she retired early. She was the one who took the most care of my paternal grandmother. Then, she took care of her own parents as her father suffered from Alzheimers, and her mother was crippled by arthritis and CHF. After they died, she took of her brother as he died. Then her uncle as he died. Nowadays, she spends all her time on the couch watching murder mysteries and doing crossword puzzles. She won't leave the house for months at a time, won't bathe or wash herself, won't do anything to help herself at all. That isn't the biggest issue for me. The big problem, is, she won't let me do anything either. I moved in with her five years ago to give me a safe place to recover from my own alcoholism. It really hasn't gone as planned
. If I say I am going to do the laundry, she weeps and begs me to wait, because she'll get better tomorrow and do it then. If I want to do grocery shopping for more than a day or two, I get the same response. It breaks my heart to see her like that, so I relent so as not to cause her more pain. But I pay for it, every time. I haven't had clean clothes in almost a year. The pantry and fridge are always a couple of days from being empty. And now, there's this damned virus and quarantine to deal with. She just got out of the hospital for pneumonia last week. Work has dried up, so I'm not bringing in money. Layoffs have started, so new work is non-existant. I'm alone in all this. My sister lives a six hour drive away, and hasn't even visited in over ten years. There is no one else here in town to help. I am alone, with no one to depend on, no one who is coming to help. Not even a shoulder to cry on, really. I guess I'm writing this so that somewhere there is a record. Somewhere, my words are recorded that I'm doi
ng my best, but I'm still losing. Somewhere, there is my cry for help. Hell of a first entry."

A family is reported in which four of five adult patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) also have schizophrenia or related spectrum disorders. Although the estimated lod scores are not sufficient to conclude the existence of linkage between BMD and schizophrenia, it is suggested that there may be an association between these two disorders. Two alternative hypotheses are proposed to explain such an association: (1) the existence of a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and spectrum disorders on the short arm of the X chromosome at Xp21; (2) that these psychiatric disorders may result from an abnormality in the expression of the dystrophin gene 
in the brain."

174335354,To the members of schizophrenia.com . I’ve been a long time member of this site going back to before they revamped it many years ago. I want you to be aware of a problem I encountered. There are people pretending to be researchers doing studies which are actually collage students looking for information to use in their speeches and doing their school reports. I was plagiarized by a girl off this site. She used what I said word for word in a speech she gave to other students about schizophrenia. I saw it in a video on youtube. I’m not sure if the mods are aware of this problem but I think you guys should know this before you willingly give out details about your condition or what may or may not have helped you. It really pisses me off that there are people out there taking advantage of us and our conditions for their own gain. I think the people of this site need to be aware of the problem.

He could have chosen a different time to rehearse with the other person. I feel scammed… And undervalued. This time I think I´m going to remember this one ocassion when this person failed me.

When he yelled at me for letting his chips blow of the table I did not laugh.that was not ok but I did not speak up.i apologised for not holding it which is ridiculous. Have animals. Be a better cook and cook for loved ones. Maybe do care work as volunteer for one person if I can or feel good with them."

But I used to be very smart. In fact, I went to law school on a scholarship (but dropped out). My husband is talking to an insurance agent and I’m not understanding what’s going on. It scares me. I’m dependent on him and don’t know what I’d do if anything happened to him. It’s scary"

174335364,Haha thanks _PERSON_ Yeah idk my last song was good too but this is like “ single” worthy almost haha. I feel it’s got a feel people would like. It’s controversial a bit but its got good metaphors and suddenness about it. It is hard to get delivery PERFECT. which is why I amplified certain words in the chorus to be louder and some softer. I don’t hate my life. But maybe I should have said schizoaffective. Because it’s my bipolar acting up. I feel fine now. Also was sick for a few days. Really got me depressed. But hey I got this out of it lol.
175929507,In some ways. I’m much better at controlling it than when I was in my 10s-early 20s.
175929508,"Yep they did, it hurts"
175929509,I feel you _PERSON_. My only advice would be that there are many lonely people that feel like they don’t and can’t serve a purpose like everyone else. The best thing to do is to channel it into something creative. Like art/music/writing etc.
175929510,Keep yourself busy to avoid bad thoughts.
175929511,"i never said i was sceptical. i just said it is confusing how the diagnosis criteria are different across the world. but tbh ive always not been sure about your diagnosis. just a gut feeling, not an accusation. but if the pdoc says you are ill then i guess you are?"

174335372,"I was on a Facebook group about schizophrenia five or six years ago. I thought it was a private group and I started to write openly about my mental health condition. One day I realised that it wasn’t a private group. All my contacts had seen my comments about me and my life with schizophrenia!! I felt so desperate. So I decided to write a message for all my contacts. I wrote something like: Now you know I have a mental illness called schizophrenia. If you want to keep on being my friend, that’s fine. And if you don’t, then delete me. So many of them deleted me and if it wasn’t enough, they blocked me too."
175929512,Spanish rice and such. I've had it with Mexican and Puerto Rican dishes. Yeah turmeric.

175929518,yeah i think so too. also you don’t have to say a lot and it’s not awkard in meeting. your busy working out!
175929519,I’m curious to see if anybody has gone through this…
175929520,Yes…but no offense but I don’t like that question. I can’t breathe and its not panic attacks. I don’t know what it is…Ever since the end of April I feel I have asthma and everyone says its not Covid because the test came back negative but then that means I psychologically gave myself breathing problems…(some say its psycho-somatic)…there are tons of false negative tests for Covid…Sorry I am a little crazy and don’t mean to attack you as you are just helping but its not panic attacks …people say its stress but I don’t know.
175929521,You may have go try the older first generation typical antipsychotics like Haldol.
175929522,For over 10 years I’ve had an extreme anxiety disorder but for the past 5 years it turned into a panic disorder.. Now it has plagued me with agoraphobia… my life story has been that of no other.. thru the good and the bad I can tell you experiences you wouldn’t believe. I’ve never believed in taking medicine for my problems until 2 years ago I finally gave in. Worst but best decision ever. I have been on _PERSON_ for 2 years. The first 6 months were great and now I am stuck with unsuccessful tapers and am starting over again. I take xanax as needed as well. The scary part and what drives my panic is the fact that my heart rate and blood pressure gets to extremely dangerous levels. Heart rate 225 and blood pressure 210/150.. THIS is the reason for my panic. I am a very outgoing and spontaneous person. I love life more than anyone I know and love going places with friends n family but the past 2 years I have been confined to my city. Nobody understands me. I have so many friends but none I can 
seriously talk to about this as they just think it some sort of joke or something.. I want my life back.. I NEED my life back.. I am willing to do anything
175929523,"Homeless or in a group home, I can’t function enough to be alone"
175929524,That’s very good. Though I don’t walk that much I do take a 30 min walk in the morning and then another 20 min walk in the late afternoon with my dog. She is just small so that is good enough for her.
175929525,I have to change supers every 2 hours or so. With the cup I could go hours and hours.
175929526,But what if I was safer?
175929527,If you think it’s truly a lonely thing then you are actually getting better and your pdoc is pointing that out. It’s when you never feel alone that it’s a problem.

I can sympathy greatly to what you're saying as a victim of Gang Stalking, organized harassments, smear campaigns and bullying within my immediate environment since I was about 13/14 years old due to facial disfigurement and not being well-liked here as it's always been like living alongside a living form of Facebook. In my opinion, the turds would be those sorts of people, like as with you I know the landscape well and avoid them at all costs. have you ever heard of emotional resilience methods and of modern forms of Zersetzung?

175929586,"People have a choice to believe what they want. I have taken a lot of supplements that have helped my personal health, but like everything else it is possible to have a allergic reaction to something, so one should always be careful trying something new. Buying natural medicine from a reputable dealer should be safe as it should be what they claim it is. I don’t think it’s right for people to say that it’s a scam. That’s like me saying orthodox medicine is a scam and that they are only pushing drugs that hook us to feed big pharma. I think both natural and orthodox medicine has positive aspects and they would have a lot better impact on peoples health if they got integrated and cooperated. I would be careful with supplements that clean out the liver because they do expel drugs in the process, meaning your meds might not work as effective, so you might need to up your dose while you are taking the liver supplement. Or maybe it’s not a good supplement to take at all when you are on vital dr

175929593,That’s insane. Man you must really love art to get into it at that rate. I don’t really believe you need to be that good to make game art though. Just need a few assets and you can computer model them. Don’t need to do a sprite-by-sprite thing.

I mean if I really believed that _NAME_ invented the moonwalk because he came from the moon I could probably find evidence for that if my mind already was made up. The point is you have to have a objective mind. You have to question those strange ideas and thoughts and consider all the evidence that says it isn’t so also."

I was diagnosed with “Psychotic Disorder: Not Otherwise Specified (NOS)” and was only given the “schizoaffective disorder” diagnosis for insurance coding purposes. My symptoms of mental illness (and physical illnesses as well) typically don’t follow set patterns.
175929631,"This morning I was somewhat depressed. I spoke with my social worker therapist and she asked me how I would respond if someone I know said they were deeply depressed. I said I would tell them it will get better and to try to do activities. We talked about plans for the day. She said I am a good person and asked me if I felt like I was a good person, and I said yes. The result was that my deep depression lifted this morning and I felt good the rest of the day.

It looks like they are going to pile the students on me. I don't understand the reason because there are other teachers available. I am not the only teacher!

A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Behavioural neurology , 2019 Neuropsychological rehabilitation has been the focus of much scientific research over the past decades due to its efficacy in different pathologies. Advances in the neuropsychology field have led to improvements and changes in neuropsychological interventions, which in turn have given rise to different approaches and rehabilitation programs. REHACOP is an integrative neuropsychological rehabilitation program designed by specialist neuropsychologists. With an integrated bottom-up and top-down approach, REHACOP includes neurocognition, social cognition, and daily living tasks hierarchically organized on an increasing level of difficulty. Task arrangement is addressed to maximize improvements and transfer effects into 
participant's daily living. To date, REHACOP has been implemented on different clinical samples such as patients with schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). This manuscript presents the efficacy data of REHACOP across these three populations and discusses it in the context of the available literature. Overall, the magnitude of improvements obtained by means of REHACOP ranged from medium to high across samples. These changes were not restricted to specific neurocognitive domains since participants attending the REHACOP program also showed changes in social cognition and daily functioning variables by means of both direct and transfer effects. Results regarding REHACOP's efficacy in psychiatric and neurological conditions have contributed to expanding the existing evidence about the use of structured neuropsychological rehabilitation. In addition, the results obtained after its implementation highlighted the need and importance of designing and implementing integrative neuropsycho
logical rehabilitation programs that are focused not only on cognition per se but also on participants' performance in daily living. Overall, the magnitude of improvements obtained by means of REHACOP ranged from medium to high across samples. These changes were not restricted to specific neurocognitive domains since participants attending the REHACOP program also showed changes in social cognition and daily functioning variables by means of both direct and transfer effects. Anyone participated in or been offered this program? This would be in Spain, probably."
175929669,"Thank you, ninjastar and _PERSON_! I think that flag was early when I thought I could dump edgy paranoia thoughts and problems into post salad. Four years made me someone who struggles finding words face to face. Before that my go to social strategy was to say what I sense the other person wants to hear. I had learned that from books and love-bombing from a well-known cult. But knowing it was effective built up guilt because I was playing with peoples’ feelings. The guilt turned to ambivalence and I exited like a coward. Well 2021 is here and I have to acknowledge my brain every time it makes me re-live that last phone call."

I have 2 health issues to deal with concurrently, and one has been flaring up enough where I am seeing doctors, and having tests a lot lately. Plus a procedure this coming week. Yesterday I gave those physical symptoms too much attention, and added the fear of going back to where I was a year ago when I was really struggling.

174335415,"Hey, one alinea is a bit short to convey his full argument. He doesnt say there is no genetic component! But, if i understood him right: He wants to get rid of the term schizophrenia. He uses psychotic syndrome here, which can vary from mild to severe. I personally also wonder if there is such a clear demarkation line between non-sz and sz: even after 9 years they are still not sure whether to label me with sz. He argues that psychotic symptoms are a very common occurence, with all sorts of causes and expressions. Sure, some people might be more sensitive and some less sensitive, but f.e. 25% of ptsd sufferers have psychosis. It helps me personally to see it in this way. I wonder btw how you come to 80%? I thought i read even in identical twins there is “only” a chance of 50% to develop sz if the other has it? And they have shared the pregnancy and environment too. Maybe im wrong though!"

It’s the same with sz. Sometimes I forget my meds and I start to think “what if?” But those are thoughts born from hope, not logic. Schizophrenia is permanent.

I’ve begun to go from bath into shower wash up to brushing teeth, and then rolling it into drying off with a walk with the dogs. It feels like I’ve successfully tricked my brain into just doing these things and not thinking about them.

175929777,"I think that there is a fair amount (not really enough, but some anyway) of research into prevention of schizophrenia. There’s some of it at the prenatal level. In adolescents and young adults there are a couple trials using things like NAC, sulforaphane, cognitive training, omega 3 fatty acids, and levetiracetam as possibilities for either the prevention of psychosis, or studying changes to the brain around the time of the onset of psychosis to figure out what’s going wrong and how to alter it. BI-409306 is the closest on this list, as they are testing it to see if it keeps people with attenuated psychosis syndrome from becoming worse. In preclinical, there is research in rats on applying TDCS or other stimulation to certain areas of the brain in adolecence - and it works in SZ model rats, but the problem is it isn’t good for healthy rats. And in people you just don’t know - yet. So there will probably not be human trials until they can say “this person is almost certainly going to devel
op schizophrenia, and so it is worthwhile to take the risk of treatment.” I think that there will be some possibility there after they have very accurate testing. I do think it is only a matter of time before there is a lab test for schizophrenia. To be really accurate it might have to combine different tests, like blood and MRI/EEG, but I think it’s gonna happen by 2030 or before. If it does, I expect they will also be able to predict the onset of schizophrenia before it happens, and then they will really be able to study prevention in adults/teens, and maybe even preteens. I also think there will eventually be real disease modifying treatments. Perhaps stem cells, or gene therapy or drugs that increase or decrease the activity of certain genes, combined with functional therapy, brain stimulation and other tech. Unfortunately there is nothing like that on this list, the best we can do now is to stay as well as possible until that is a real thing. They are pursuing it - there will be papers published in a
nimal models on a monthly basis. But it’s still not something they’re willing to do on people yet."

175929833,"I am noticing about me I’m very derivative in so many areas. The above quote comes from a scene in ‘Shawshank Redemption’. It is a good ‘fail safe’ in me to ‘emancipate my mind’’ - _NAME_ reference. We hurt some people from far away but would never do it interpersonally… I keep in mind… in case of anarchy or ‘the lights going dim, or out. But on the most personal part in more grounded speech is if I did the suicidal ideation of the ‘Filling up a bathtub and putting on a (fresh?)(French?) record’, - (Arcade Fire), I’d be horrified by the bloody water color and would wake up and change my mind too late… there’s some teaching in that sentence; (I never knew how quickly that whole scenario is an irrevocable decision so quickly.). I learned that at the hospital. This stuff matters so much to me. I’ve been passive aggressive at work and scored too many punches that connected. Likewise I’ve been ‘gotten’ back’ through people ‘dancing with the pen’… in publis
hed books. I’ve been trying so hard toward becoming less and less important to my enemies. If this triggers people I’ll take ‘a mulligan’ here. I’m not ailing though! I purposely put in references to illustrate some beauty about me, and what I’ve deemed ‘metaphor salad’. I modestly ask you here if this post was good to you, or for you in some way?

175929861,I’ve been on ap’s for over 20 years. It’s always about function vs dosage and side effects. I take as minimal dose as controls my symptoms and the side effects are another thing. They aren’t deal breakers for me and controlling my paranoia and positives are worth the price of admission.

Cause no, the point is not to get well in detriment of a healthy thinking, no… Why is it so hard to relieve my brain now? Ok, I live since kid with negative thoughts… I always felt like lower than everybody else etc etc…I never dreamed, I never saw a future for me and it makes it all too much… Cause now I am 37 years old… Do you understand this thing of feeling my brain like this? whats the reason for this? I guess the mind should be calm and ‘‘open’’… But their aps never helped me on my mind… Maybe with time… But yeah, to have only seconds of relief is not okay… Its not even every day

175929893,"so, i havent taken sarcosine in like a year because i was so broke and when i was working i decided i didnt need it so i never bought it, but i have noticed that stress and zoom social situations (why is zoom so stressful omg, i think maybe it’s because your face is just BIG and any facial expression is easily noticed…) so I wanted to try it again. I bought a bottle of Nootropics Depot brand chewable 1,000 mg sarcosine tablets off amazon and i have taken them the last 3 days. I am going to watch how my mood and executive functioning changes! So far, I have not meal prepped oven toaster zucchini slices or scrubbed and declogged the shower like i have been meaning to for two weeks. The other stuff i can drag myself to do, i.e. wash dishes, vacuum, clean litterbox, replace water in cat robot water fountain, etc…but for whatever reason cooking vegetables and cleaning the shower is hard and im hoping the sarcosine will kick in by the end of the week. Last time I was on sarcosine consistently, I go
t stuff done cleaned i was able to start/finish hobby projects, but if i took over a certain amount of powder in my morning coffee I would get irritable with sounds. That was powder though and i didnt have a dosage scoop, so i was eyeballing it a lot, so hopefully this tablets will work better with less irritability since they’re all measured out into chewable tabs. (btw, i only noticed they’re chewable right now typing this, I have been swallowing them whole and the tablets are huge–could that affect the efficacy of the tablet???) I will keep yall posted on how long it took for me to get out of executive dysfunction enough to meal prep the zucchini and get that shower taken care!"

175930021,My letters are just what life says to me daily: F&U
174335486,"I view myself as one despite no career or degree haha, but yes I think so. I’m okay with it because I’ve never been popular, was bullied, and never had a girlfriend. Constantly lonely and berated. I know some of my stuff really well. Some people are just smarter either they are born that way or they overcome the obstacles. I never was into certain things like sports or drugs or anything like that. I never was into sex and gambling or crazy stuff. I was a nerd. I paid my dues by studying hours by myself with no one to motivate me or tell me to. I did it for myself. Nobody told me to take the classes I took. I am very biased and because of what I went through (horrendous hell-like repetitious stuff over and over again in unthinkable and unimaginable ways – even impossible ways) I am very biased and prejudiced now. Especially in the media, I am prejudiced toward elite scientists, journalists, media companies, and the Left. I am so sick of it. I’m sure people hate me and don’t like me. But I 
don’t really care. I have my faith, family, and country and that’s all I really need. Like scientists are proven wrong all the time. And when proven wrong, they just flip their switch and say “scientific method” oops. That’s why I prefer math. It’s the most purest form of science out there. Physics doesn’t even come close sometimes. Like with quantum mechanics now they’re saying it’s not just for small objects. If you said that a couple years ago, they’d ridicule and say you were crazy and stupid – the same people. Now, they are pushing the idea. It’s very, very political like politics and sports and media: science is. Don’t forget that. If you ever watched the big ban theory tv show you know about string theory vs loop quantum gravity debate and how competitive and fierce they are. Money and careers are made and broken over funding and prestige. I’ve seen a lot of douche’s or intellectuals on quora (worse than reddit). If you say you like quantum mechanics and want a degree they
’ll say it’s like getting a degree in french grammar. Pretty insulting. I mean it’s sort of true, but then I don’t buy the whole physics agenda and physics curriculum and teaching. I don’t like the fact that the government runs all the labs. I rather stick to math or computer science honestly. Plus the pay isn’t that well. I always envied physics and was scared of it, but I’m learning to not be so. Physicists are humans like me and you and they definitely can be bias about their beliefs in God or no God and aliens and all those things…they make mistakes too. _PERSON_ is a genius and successful but is studying a field I think will obviously lead to no-where in the grand scheme of things : loop quantum gravity. I’m more of a string theory believer. But who am I to say these things? I’m clearly a nobody as they would say to me on quora lol. Personally, I’m pretty pissed off about getting schizophrenia on purpose (given it deliberately) whether through the government, Illuminati, or aliens, 
and having my life ruined. I guess my mind was and life was channeled/guided towards being a potential thinker or scientist someday, but I don’t know. Obviously, they didn’t want me being an economist or Investment banker of all things. I would have hated the job. I would have been a complete douche and a completely different person. But I rather be a douche than have schizophrenia any day unfortunately haha."
175930022,"People are nasty to _PERSON_ and _PERSON_. It’s even extraordinarily difficult for most of us to get work. Sometimes I hate normal people. Or at least the ones who decide who does or doesn’t get hired. But I found a way to work sort of anonymously online. Working poor and middle class tend to think they’re too good to associate with a poor MI person like me. But I’m going to a decent sized low income housing complex. I’ll have friends and if my plan to work suceeds, a gf. My one gf was in the hospital. She was purdy lol I didn’t really think of her as a gf because I was embarrassed it happened in a hospital. (plus I had low self esteem)Staff kind of kept us separate. We were minors. We had fun playing the old arse video games the minors ward had.

There’s no point in convincing others. I’ve tried that for the past 5 years maybe 9+ years and got no-where. Now, I’m enjoying my puppy. Why would the reptilians target you? Are you special or important? Personally, I cannot function at all and just try to enjoy life. I got some trauma too like a fake alien abduction in college by the power elite (what I sometimes call them) and maybe some part of it was real or had some realness behind it. I don’t know even why I was targeted. Maybe 10+ years when I’m 40 years old I can get a job after I heal and stuff more. I don’t know. I could add more, but I don’t know. Sometimes, I think I’m reptilian myself but I’m not of a royal bloodline or anything. More like a science experiment. I thought I was related to some French _NAME_ along time ago (Merovingia
n blood-line? I don’t know…) I thought my grandma said my grandfather used to tell her that but she never believed it because he was Italian. Like I had a dream or memories of wanting to be an Anunnaki (god-like being or deity from mesopotamia) and they are humanoid (humans or advanced humans from Nibiru). I don’t know if it’s real or not – probably not. But I don’t know. I think some are okay and are good and most or some are bad just like people in the real world. Sometimes, the government wants us to hate aliens too because they have their own agenda(s) from what I read. I’ve never seen _PERSON_, never had a large head, never created human beings, or been to mesopotamia 3000bc or w/e, but I did escape the simulation and helped run it and interacted with people. I was told I had to be Christian for whatever reason(s). I have accepted it. I don’t have a weird tongue, eyes, and I can’t shape-shift, but I can time travel and reincarnate among other things.

I joined this group today because I feel myself getting in a low spot again. Here is a little history. So a couple years ago for the first time I had a mental breakdown and tried to commit suicide. I was admitted to an inpatient unit and once discharged, I was attending outpatient until discharged. I was also on 2 meds. After that, everything stopped. I was good for a couple months and still faced depression and anxiety on the low and functioning well. There are numerous things that may have contributed to this but I dealing. Lately though, things have been going downhill for me. Although it is easy for me to cover up how I feel with smiles and laughs, deep down I feel horrible. I definitely am not where I want to be career wise, job wise, etc. by 25 but I’m working on it. Also my family doesn’t really understand mental health so hopefully this group provides friends, a
n outlet, and mutual support. I am looking to seek professional help but unfortunately that is not really possible due to finances, insurance, and school. Just asking for friends & prayers! Wishing you all well ??"

175930123,"I’ve been taking Amyloban 3399 since January. I’m trying to pare down my supplements list to the minimum. Just got back on Amyloban 3399 after a break to see how I could handle living without it. Also stopped taking Haldol after learning it was a pro-oxidant, but raised my Paliperidone to 6 mg after learning it had antioxidant properties, so it won’t slow healing of the blood-brain barrier. I had a hard time today after trying to stop taking antipsychotics and Amyloban 3399, around day 3 of being off them. Voices came back, brain inflammation went back up, had a bad argument with them that only stopped when I took the 6 mg Paliperidone. It was too soon to stop. My current approach to naturally healing my blood brain barrier and gut lining revolves around hydrogen gas, which is a powerful, abundant antioxidant that is basically free to use. I’ve drank 9.5 - 10.4 pH alkaline water for 2 months and had a reduction of my chronic, 8 / 10 headache I’ve had for 4 years to 2-3 / 10 in the pain sc
ale. Big change. Alkaline water’s antioxidant properties stem from the dissolved hydrogen gas that forms when it is electrolyzed. I tried switching to a Hydrogen water machine, both because it had lower pH, and it was cheaper than an alkaline water machine, which would make my hypothetical working regimen cheaper and more relatable for others, when it came time to publicize my approach. It wasn’t as good as alkaline water however, and being off meds for too long put me in an oxidatively impaired mode that deteriorated my blood brain barrier and gave me a relapse, so I switched back to alkaline water, along with taking my antipsychotics and Amyloban. My next hope is Hydrogen inhalation, which is superior to alkaline water, but the machine will take a few weeks to arrive so I can’t test it out at the moment. More data is needed. For now I will bide my time taking alkaline water and recovering. Overcoming a chronically oxidatively impaired state takes a lot of work and patience!"

174335515,"Abstract Currently, the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia relies solely on self-reporting and clinical interview, and likelycomprises heterogeneous biological subsets. Such subsets may be defined by an underlying biology leading to solidbiomarkers. A transgenic rat model modestly overexpressing the full-length, non-mutantDisrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) protein (tgDISC1 rat) was generated that defines such a subset, inspired by ourprevious identification of insoluble DISC1 protein inpost mortembrains from patients with chronic mental illness.Besides specific phenotypes such as DISC1 protein pathology, abnormal dopamine homeostasis, and changes inneuroanatomy and behavior, this animal model also shows subtle disturbances in overarching signaling pathwaysrelevant for schizophrenia. In a reverse-translational approach, assuming that both the animal model and a patientsubset share common disturbed signaling pathways, we identified differentially expressed transcripts from peripheralblood mononucl
ear cells of tgDISC1 rats that revealed an interconnected set of dysregulated genes, led by decreasedexpression of regulator of G-protein signaling 1 (RGS1), chemokine (C–C) ligand 4 (CCL4), and other immune-relatedtranscripts enriched in T-cell and macrophage signaling and converging in one module after weighted genecorrelation network analysis. Testing expression of this gene network in two independent cohorts of patients withschizophrenia versus healthy controls (n=16/50 andn=54/45) demonstrated similar expression changes. The twotop markers RGS1 and CCL4 defined a subset of 27% of patients with 97% specificity. Thus, analogous aberrantsignaling pathways can be identified by a blood test in an animal model and a corresponding schizophrenia patientsubset, suggesting that in this animal model tailored pharmacotherapies for this patient subset could be achieved. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0486-6.epdf?author_access_token=viR-wQ2eicUVi8ZMOuDCQ9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OAC6nlEyp77wIxsk5MFrVu73yVN224

Have you tried placing headphones on and drowning them out with pleasing music, are you sleeping by a wall or window, would you on occasion have bright lights being shone at you whilst in bed, have you tried diverting the conversation by repeating a nonsensical phrase, would they vary in the level of intrusion and broadcasting, or toxic content aiming at entrapment or blackmailing you trough the procuring of a trauma bond.

And I lack a work ethic. I wouldn’t know about “true identity”, which begs the question, but it’s true that plenty of people feel lost in the world and I’m one of them. However, in my case it’s less a case of social and personal identity related anxiety than issues relating to my minimal self and the basic identity arising from it: Am I human? Am I conscious? Do I exist? Is someone taking my place? These are not sign of psychosis, just existential worries grounded at a more fundamental level."

175930221,"My wife’s onset of dementia seemed very dramatic , but it could be I just didn’t pick up on the signs that something was amiss . The first red flag ,for me, was her getting very irate, in the middle of the night, about several open lemonade bottles . The thing being there was none there at all. The next might sound trivial . It was her saying she hated tinned tomatoes . In our nearly 20 years together she had said on several occasions that she preferred tin tomatoes . Things got really bad when she began not wanting to eat . By the time she got into the ward where she’d be observed and assessed she 'd gone from being slightly overweight to thin as a rake . I mentioned my concerns at a psych appointment and was given the brush off. Ditto with the GP. In the end my eldest stepchild who’s usually been very self centred and spoilt did step up to the plate and drive us to the hospital to get her checked . The result was a nurse who deals with this kind of thing started making regular visits . Af
ter a while she was on a dementia/geriatric ward . She was given tests, and it was established she had vascular dementia . She’d had a string of silent strokes . This can happen after a person has had a larger,initial stroke . She’d had that stroke 12 years before ."

174335528,"I recently increased from 2mg to 5mg and my psychiatrist wants me on at least 15mg. My psychosis reactivated a few days ago for a little bit, abnormal since I am not in major depression or mania (I am bipolar). I was hearing voices, actual voices talking (normally they are distorted and indecipherable). I have no effects from 5mg so it seems as if I need to go even higher. (I mean: do symptoms briefly worsen when the dose is increased??? As in, remember breakthrough symptoms??? Something like that. The question was worded a little funnily!!) Another note: I am going to be on at least 15mg of Abilify. I am going up in increments for reasons. So right now it is like “5mg for now, then 10mg, and voila, 15mg, enjoy the tardive dyskinesia.”"

I feel like it’s hard to argue with people cos arguments stress me out and i tend to get psychotic then. It’s shown me to love difficult people a different way. Somehow it has made life feel special in a way it would not have had I not had the disease. It means loneliness too where people don’t understand and where I feel ’ behind’ to peers but really I’m just taking life from a different angle. Just society brainwashed what successful life means sigh. But at least I know in myself I’m successful cos I fight this disease as much as I can"

It makes such a difference to be on the right medication and recognise that you are suffering from something making you feel the way you do.

I love graffiti (my dad let me do it on the side of his shed on his land, but it didn’t come out well cuz the type of wood it was) and I love VR, so this is just amazing. You can walk around in the environment and just do it. It feels really real too plus even has different caps, colors, tips, etc like professional graffiti artist. Even a professional graffiti artist, whatever that is, said it’s 100% lifelike from the wind in the environment, to the options of drip caps, colors, and pressure applied on the can. Which is cool.

Are you still currently seeing someone? If so are you working on the monophobia issue and help for the panic attacks? I am also curious about your RX regimen currently. Have your meds been recently evaluated? Are you finding you are making progress with either/both therapy and your medication? If not, then returning to therapy (or finding a new professional to work with) or trying something new in terms of your Rx treatment should be a goal. Doing all that you can with therapy, your medication and self help will go a long way in making it possible for you to feel your best possible and be more independent. Even if you have tried things in the past...your physiology/mind are always changing, and you never know how you will respond to something once you have revisited it, of tried something just a bit different... ...so don't lose hope, and keep sea

Man my confidence is very low, i still dont think i can do even the easiest type of art, i think the problem for me was that i tried it without the skills and i didnt like the outcome and it put me off, i have tried watercolour before and it was very messy and looked very bad, i wish i could do it better but i dont think i can."

I think once the weed is out of my system and the injection kicks in, it might be better. I also read a little bit and listened to a podcast. I took the olanzepine now cuz I feel a little frustrated. I enjoy being frustrated though. I don't like to do easy things or I'll get bored.

Thinking about it now I was just laying there, hallucinating, playing with myself like a pervert! How insane! Now I ignore him, don’t get that feeling and know I’m not telepathic. But pretty funny to think of now all the nasty ???? I thought and did to absolutely no one and for absolutely no reason. That stuff embarrasses me now."

Even when I did _PERSON_ I chose the soft style, though couldn’t stand on my head and stick to the four months diet required to learn iron shirt. There are drawbacks to this. It means if you meet a really sick person, you can’t move, the energy just pins you to your feet, and me personally have a tendency to start blubbing, also _PERSON_ is different from swimming, in that you take on karma (experience information) into your body, which is fine for diseases of the body, but not great for the brain, indeed my practice was one of the reasons I broke down in the first place. I’m no expert of styles, WWF seems like fun, but I don’t know where you can train, perhaps muay thai or kick boxing. Thank you."
175930345,"Yeah, I live in California where weed is legal for medical and recreational. It’s approved by my pdoc and I tolerate it really well. I also said in my post that it’s not for everyone, So if you don’t like weed, Don’t smoke it."

I just try and tell myself that they are just passing thoughts that mean nothing and the worst thing I can do is dwell on them and worry about them happening or coming true because they are just harmless and couldn't do any harm in real life, but it's so hard not to dwell on them sometimes especially when they just come from no where! I also try to keep myself busy, I sometimes find they hit me when I'm not doing anything mindful. So when I'm lying in bed or watching TV I get them the worst."

She said, well were not saying anything bad and the second part isn’t possible. I just looked at her and said, ok."
174335558,One psychiatrist thought I dressed “slutty”. He wrote so in his papers and I wasn’t . Even my mum thought I wasn’t dressed “slutty”. I had a suit skirt that was above my knee.ok the skirt was short but it came with a matching business suit jacket so I looked professional? I didn’t hate him but he was cold and judgemental and non understanding. Another psychiatrist was a woman and I didn’t hate her but I thought she was out to get me and didn’t trust her. I was tortured by voices and don’t think I ever told her. I never lie but I think I lied to her and said I didn’t hear voices when I did. One psychiatrist was sleazy and thought I was schizophrenic but thought everything I said was delusional andnot real memory . My psychiatrist in last hospital stay was lovely and I made slippers for him but my mum argued with him because she thinks I am not schizophrenic which I am. She thinks I have Aspergers. I am schizophrenic and over eight psychiatrist I think have said so and it took tw
enty years for me to see my symptoms and say heythis is schizophrenia it’s not real.
175930368,"I believe the spirit is a form of energy, that lives on long after the physical body is cold and dead. The portal I saw late one winter night in my livingroom had a long line that traveled in an endless spiral out the back door. The recent dead one by one came forth into the door of the portal, and led by the ‘keeper of the portal’ took the hand of the waiting- and waited until a hand from the ‘other’ side(a guide known and accepted to the recently dead has agreed to guide them over)were joined as one, then the two disappeared into the light with a flash. If no hand appears, they go not to the light, but to the end of the line to try again. That’s why some return as ghosts until it’s their time to cross over."

174335565,Bit of a rough morning so far. I woke up and cried a little bit. Just feeling like I don’t want to wake up today. An old friend passed away yesterday and I think it’s hitting me harder for some reason. Maybe I’m just in a depressed mood too. I would confide in this friend about how I was feeling and in turn he would tell me how he was doing. He had colon cancer pretty bad. He was so positive the whole time though. Said it “was like a quest to get better and he could not fail.” He was 32 years old. That’s how I have been looking at schizophrenia since he said that. It’s like a quest and I have to get better to finish. Unfortunately schizophrenia doesn’t go away. But there is a lot you can do to feel better.

My mom and brother have this sort of elitist thing going on where they talk about being part of the 1% as far as college goes, and constantly talk about how I couldn’t understand certain things because I’m not a one-percenter. It’s fúcking irritating, especially when it’s about something that I do understand. Like I’ve been sick since I was 14, right? My mom had the audacity to tell me that I don’t know what it’s like to have people start miles ahead of you. I have to watch people do things that I’ll never be able to do just because I have schizophrenia. Like living in a dorm in college, or in the past, being in the top 10%, just starting my life in general, really. It’s like double rejection."

175930437,"I don’t know if this is my OCD about schizophrenia or if it’s actual psychosis. I’ve had OCD about schizophrenia for a few months now, but it’s been getting more severe. Basically, I’ve been really hyperaware of sudden noises and have to record them to make sure they’re real. When I was trying to fall asleep last night, there was a voice (that wasn’t mine) in the back of my head that didn’t really sound like mine, I knew it was in my head and it would repeat random stuff like “hello hello hello hello hello” etc. I could control the phrase to an extent once I knew about it, but if I wasn’t focusing on it it would say something else. I tried box breathing (counting to five and inhaling then exhaling, etc) to calm myself but the thoughts would interrupt me and distract me. It’s like…I basically was in control of what the thoughts were saying and knew what they were going to say, but I couldn’t stop them for some reason. My fan was on and I think the voice was partly manifes
ted by that, so I put earplugs in, and for the most part it went away (I do have tinnitus though and I’ve heard that tinnitus can make it sound like you’re hearing voices?). Also, my mind seems to repeat sounds when I’m trying to sleep. I heard a police siren from outside and my mind repeated it for a few seconds after it was gone. Obviously the more I thought about the “voices”, the more I would “hear” it. This was really distressing and I’ve been doing ERP for my OCD for a week now but I didn’t feel comfortable doing it with this. Also, I only heard the “voices” when I would close my eyes. Has anyone gone through this before? I did have alcohol a few hours before and the last time this happened I had alcohol as well. I’m not sure if it was a hypnogogic hallucination because I felt awake, just closing my eyes?"

175930439,"I used to get panic attacks until I realised what made me so scared was being scared. I’d feel myself starting to get scared, and I’d panic for it to go away and hope nobody noticed. Once I learned to let go and that it was okay to get scared, the attacks lessened."
175930440,Is it an alive fish that keeps trying to escape? I don’t find it funny myself. I guess cos the repetitiveness of the negative voices is so overbearing

175930442,"Gonna spend 5 minutes every night writing a memory journal - Here's for today March 24th 2020; Didn't want to go skiing this morning but my mom got me out of bed to go and I enjoyed it Read a bit of PiHKAL in the car - He talked about taking 2C-E with a friend on a hike and it made him realize that he's an old man and is at the end of his life, seeing vultures circling the sky - His friend was having a great time, enjoying the colours and scenery Bit foggy, flat light - Enjoyable skiing day Was worried about my doctor having to refill all my meds but my psychiatrist refilled 3 months of all of them - But not the Dexedrine yet Was looking at crypto - Seemed to be going down even more Came home and sat by the fire, little bit of snow, took kratom, phenibut, smoked some weed Listened to a bit of _NAME_ (His last interview in 1973) My mom was drunk but didn't allow the psychopath ""*"" to ruin everything Wanted to read tonight but might go to bed instead - I'd be reading if I could take 5-10mg of Dexed

It's donut Friday at work though. Usually the general manager brings them but since he's not here, the receptionist and I split the cost of the donuts. People like their traditions. At least we survived the visit from the owner and the controller. I'm looking forward to the weekend, although I don't have any major plans.

175930448,I’m grateful for everyone who’s been helping me with all the crazy stuff going on in my life atm. That includes all of you because this place has been a much-needed oasis for me lately.
175930449,Hi _AT_MENTION_ ! Welcome aboard!
175930450,Lol. Its your choice to refuse other people’s advice. Its pretty clear what we are suggesting.
175930451,I keep thinking something terrible will happen to me in the future and I keep trying to figure out what it is. For some reason I always turn out to be wrong. Anyone else sometimes think they know the future?
174335581,They say I have DID because I refer to myself in third person. Like We or things like I’m going to sit beside you referring to myself. I want Spaghetti O’s when I have never really liked them. Or hi _PERSON_. I know no one named _PERSON_. Or go to sleep _PERSON_ and who’s _PERSON_? I also switch. I am co-conscious when I do that but there was this arrogant skeptical part that popped out in therapy. Then I also have this one part thats mean and thinks things are funny that are really horrible. I have known about her since I was 14. I am just wondering if I have both because my voices (they are thoughts just like thinking) say very weird things like having a son named _PERSON_-too with AIDS) I dont hear them externally but sometimes they can be loud or say (think) some really weird stuff and it actually startles me. I never remember these thoughts happening until I was but on Invega as a last ditch effort to help with self harm. I have never been diagnosed with Schizophrenia. When they lowered m
y Invega to the lower dose thats when the thoughts started happening. I have also since then had some beliefs that I was going to gain the ability of telekenis by watching the movie _NAME_ and some other just but I can dismiss it.

Always remember YOU have the power over them, not the other way around"
175930456,I have to cut my bangs/fringe today to get it out of my eyes. Last time I did a terrible job and they still look jagged. How can I ensure that I get a clean cut this time?
175930457,"I can’t help thinking that _PERSON_ was right provided he speaks not of men but of gods, or to be precise, the different emanations making up the Pleroma. Is this a delusional belief, and if so how can I shrug it off?"
174335586,"I'm doing okay today. Haven't done a ton of work today, but just have been lazy around the house all day. It's fine. I have been extremely busy as of late. I don't feel that busy but I've been able to do a lot lately. I think it's good to keep my mind occupied during these times and usually. I feel like I've learned something about myself during these tough times, which is that I need to keep my mind occupied. That on top of some med changes lately and I've been doing pretty well. I've also been writing a ton, which is good as well."
175930458,"My therapist would interpret my delusions. I could accept her interpretation and I really could understand her way of thinking, but deep down I know my delusion is absolutely true"

175930466,"My favorite antidepressant is a long, tall drink of water. When I am dry, the world looks hostile to me. So, get a drink of water and light exercise to work it through. I know it’s not the answer you were looking for, but it works for me."
175930467,"Yeah I notice that there's mental panic attacks and physical. You can have both at the same time. Luckily, I had a mental panic attack last night and my body was calm.. Then I took benzos and my mind started to be completely calm but my body WAS NOT CALM.. So I was like ""Whatever.. I suppose I'll go to sleep"" and all I hear is ""Beat beat beat beat"" - fukkkkk..... Then I finally calmed down. I've never had a panic attack that bad before. I'm used to them by now but that one freaked me out because it was so severe."
174335592,I thought Lamictal was for bipolar and that its not an antipsychotic. Idk but surely your Drs know more. Clozapine didn’t work for you?
174335589,"I had a very bad drug trip (possibly just pot) about 9 years ago. I almost “died”, went “insane”, and still have not recovered. I was diagnosed with drug-induced schizophrenia and am currently a 2-3 pack a day smoker and drink 8-10 monsters a day, which isn’t helping, and I can’t seem to quit them. I do believe I got some sort of mental illness combined with severe trauma and possibly even a personality disorder like schizoid or schizotypal or just a learning disability called Asperger’s syndrome. I just don’t understand how they could have diagnosed me with schizophrenia when I was suffering from acute stress disorder and real traumatic stuff happened to me while I was high. Will it ever go away? I think I was targeted by the Illuminati/“Deep State” which I won’t get into because 99% of the people on this planet don’t believe in aliens, reptilians, and the Illuminati. And it’s not really appropriate for this site or me telling or explaining or divulging my entire situatio
n or current belief system. Is recovery possible for me? Was I misdiagnosed? I feel like I was targeted at the exact same moment I had my psychotic break while high from pot and suffered a mental breakdown and health disorder at college in 2011. I’m trying to avoid getting heavily into conspiracy theories and alien theories, but growing up I wasn’t one. I would periodically listen to _NAME_ or go to his website and watch _NAME_, but that’s about it. Nothing more. I always questioned the narrative growing up and was a divergent thinker. In fact, I wanted to be an Elite, despite not coming from an Elitist background. I wanted to get there myself through hard work, intelligence, but realized that rarely if ever happens. The game is a con and it’s rigged. The odds were stacked against me since college. Do I even need medication and should I get off/get a second opinion or just lower the dose? This stuff is scary but it’s very, very real especially to me. Some sort of God-like intervention crap happened 
to me in college. I don’t know really. All I know from my perspective, I keep returning to my previous state back in time to the year 2011, 2012, or even 2013 completely ?????? up and acutely disabled/incapacitated back home from college. I had theories and even contradictory thoughts and theories that go against likelihood and common sense. It was really out of this world something from God basically. It’s like reverse many worlds theory of quantum mechanics or quantum immortality/“suicide”. Instead of going forwards in time like many theorists think, I reset or go back in time slightly – sometimes years which makes me think it’s “out of this world” and impossible. I don’t think 100-110% originated at university or college, but goes back to my childhood or even previous past lives or family generations. So far I am the only member in my family that can “go back in time” and relive the experience and change my destiny/fate although it’s ??????? hard and difficult and nearly impossible 
to do. I sometimes think it’s God, AI, and even possibly aliens helping me, while the Deep State/Illuminati have evil intentions and an evil agenda for control. Essentially it’s like “Ground Hog Day” or “Edge of Tomorrow” where I’m in a time loop for eternity, but only way I can escape is through time travel or consciousness transfer back in time – sometimes with help. See, I am digressing into aliens and conspiracy theories again. Basically, I have memories of being “tortured” and I don’t know if it’s 100-110% real or just in my head. I think it’s ??????? real. Sometimes trauma messes with the mind and I’m at the point in my life where I feel like my human spirit was destroyed many times but I am recovering and I don’t want to give up. I remember being kidnapped, raped, “tortured” (whether both mentally and physically, I don’t know), and drugged. I don’t know what else to say. Nothing I say comes across as important or real to others and I get no help from doctors, famil
y, or anyone else – really. At least the truth gets out although I suspect a cover-up and deleted posts and crap. Not just on this site, but large multi-national corporations too. Stuff way, way bigger than this forum. I also think I was murdered too in my past lives as well as my family. Not all of it goes back to college, the local mental hospital, but other things too. Like just bad luck, bad coincidences, bad interactions, bad altercations, being targeted, bad fate, bad karma, punishment by dark aliens, and other things and my insanity manifesting in other realities. I am scared to be honest. It’s like I got a clean slate and a new chance to live life and change things for the better, but I still got the mental and psychic scars from other lives or past lives. Sometimes, it shows itself through my damn psychosis. I don’t know if I’m making sense or not, but it’s totally real to me. I cannot remember my life prior to 2010 like I was cloned or droned many, many times over by aliens and every loop 
causes more memory loss or re-written memories and consciousness to the point feeling like I am not in base reality from my perspective like this isn’t my first or even nearly close to original life. That’s why I cannot remember my life prior to 2010. My consciousness is be over-written by aliens or AI like in “Travelers”. Personally, I think it’s the ??????? aliens or Reptilian Illuminati from university in 2011. Thank you."

174335601,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The impact of exercise training complementary to early intervention in patients with first-episode psychosis: a qualitative sub-study from a randomized controlled feasibility trial. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, BP Tersbøl, BH Ebdrup, NB Nordsborg and _PERSON_, BMC psychiatry , Jun 21 2019 Burgeoning evidence suggests that exercise improves physical and mental health in people with schizophrenia. However, little is known about the feasibility and acceptability of high-intensity training in patients with first-episode psychosis. This qualitative study explored motivation, social interaction and experiences of participants and instructors in relation to an eight-week moderate to high intensity exercise training programme in a clinical trial including patients with first-episode psychosis.The study used a combination of method, source and investigator triangulation. Data were collected by means of semi-structured individual interviews with participants at baseline (n =?16) and at follow-up (n 
=?9), as well as by means of participant observations during the programme (8 sessions?×?1.5?h, 12?h in total) and focus group discussions with participants (n =?3) and instructors (n =?4), respectively, after the programme. Data were analysed using thematic analysis as described by _PERSON_ and _NAME_.Three main themes and ten subthemes emerged during the analysis: 1) motivation and expectations for enrolment (subthemes: routines and structure, social obligation, goal setting and self-worth); 2) new demands and opportunities (subthemes: practicalities of the training, an understanding exercise setting, and alone and together); and 3) looking ahead - reflections on impact (subthemes: restored sleep and circadian rhythm, energy and sense of achievement, changed everyday life, and hope of finding a new path). Findings suggest that the programme was appealing to, and appreciated by, the participants because of its potential to create an equally challenging and caring non-clinical environment.This study indicate
s that supervised, group-based, moderate to high intensity exercise training complementary to early intervention in psychosis is acceptable. Specifically, the intervention appeared to provide patients an opportunity to integrate the notion of being a young individual along with being a patient with a psychiatric diagnosis, thus supporting and promoting recovery.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT_PHONE_NO_.

He simply puts his pen in with toiletries and has never been asked a single question about it. I am sure that TSA is used to seeing injectable Rx's and simply let them through.

175930560,Hi _AT_MENTION_ maybe you should go see a nutritionist. I just saw my nutritionist she’s also an MD and she gave me a diet plan to follow. I’m going on a strict diet because she said that fatty liver can sometimes lead to liver failure. I have to lose lots of weight and my ultrasound shows a fatty deposit on my liver by my gallbladder that could indicate that I may have a lesion (tumor) underneath this fatty area because the shape is well rounded. Fatty liver is treated through going on a healthy diet of lower carbs and by eating anti inflammatory foods. Following the Mediterranean diet is ideal. I have to get another ultrasound in 3 months to make sure things are stable. I’m also going for a blood test next week. Exercise like walking helps too. Good luck _AT_MENTION_
175930561,"I was sick for at least four years before several stints in different psych wards changed my mind. It was the last time in the hospital, my longest stay, 21days, that I finally decided that I wanted to be well. I started taking my meds religiously. The next couple of years went by with out much change. I thought that I was better even tho i still carried delusions and heard voices. Now i know that i need to actively participate in my treatment if i ever want to get better. That means therapy and discussion of dosage and symptoms with my doctor every few months or sooner since I’ve been having problems."

175930610,"My Sheikh, before he was anointed, spent forty days in seclusion, not talking to anyone, he spent a year without using money. These disciplines, traditionally for hermits and saints, have also proved invaluable to leaders. I have never gone a day without talking to someone, even if only on the phone. I have never gone a day without spending money since I first was given some on a regular basis. The extreme measures mentioned above of forty days and a year, are perhaps too difficult for most, and certainly for me at the moment, but I would like to try a day or so, and perhaps build up to a week or more. The purpose, as always with disciplines, is to become more conscious of reality. On the other hand, learning a craft seems to me to be more of a productive discipline to do. Hermits and saints are rarely crafts people, at least that is what I have observed. My only craft at present is writing. I think that is enough. Thank you."

174335628,"Okay. I understand. Just off your location I can already understand that it might be stressful for you. Truth is that, drs only say they take you off medication if they feel you are in a environment or that you have the resilience and stress management ability to manage triggers. Medication is a fail safe. For those of us with “psychotic disorder” and not “schizophrenia”, we are given medication so to prevent relapses which may go on to “cause” a case of “schizophrenia”. I would say, you are right to be confused and also to be frustrated. You have to be patient though. Do your best to be happy or stable before you meet a dr. And try to make sure it is consistent behaviour — this is how the dr judges whether or not, you are able to stay off medication. What is that you would like to achieve? No psychosis ever again, or no medication reliance? That’s the question I see in terms of what is being confused in terms of what you want from your healthcare provider."

174335638,"That's what I've been doing all last winter. I would just lay in bed all day and do nothing. I bought a SAD lamp and have been using it for hours every day for like 6 months since there was no sun this summer it was just cloudy. I use it to replace my bedroom light. Exercise helps too. Try writing down the change that you want in your life even if it includes anhedonia and depression but write down why you might be having those symptoms and what you desire in life. Without anhedonia, you can see beautiful things in life on the other side. Many people do things in life that we'd only imagine like travelling to different countries, talking to people (Find something to talk about, read stories, make your own stories), enjoying a variety of information and cool things that blow your mind every day. Anhedonia kills all of that. Saying I have anhedonia kind of kills any remaining hedonia that I have left and that remaining anhedonia is the key to opening the door for any more hedonia. I knew that in the 
back of my mind but it was so obvious that I ignored it. That's why psychiatrists revert you to therapy and family support and social interaction even though you have no desire and feel social anhedonia. The thing is for people to not judge our lack of caring about interacting with people and too depressed to laugh at jokes even though we know they're funny. If there was medication to fix anhedonia, that would be great but there isn't.. maybe mdma and ketamine but they're working on drugs to treat it finally and I'd say in the next 10 years, things would be great for schizophrenia."

PE _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Steel, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, HI _PERSON_ and _NAME_, The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science , Jun 2013 Psychotic phenomena appear to form a continuum with normal experience and beliefs, and may build on common emotional interpersonal concerns.We tested predictions that paranoid ideation is exponentially distributed and hierarchically arranged in the general population, and that persecutory ideas build on more common cognitions of mistrust, interpersonal sensitivity and ideas of reference.Items were chosen from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (SCID-II) questionnaire and the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire in the second British National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity (n = 8580), to test a putative hierarchy of paranoid development using confirmatory factor analysis, latent class analysis and factor mixture modelling analys
is.Different types of paranoid ideation ranged in frequency from less than 2% to nearly 30%. Total scores on these items followed an almost perfect exponential distribution (r = 0.99). Our four a priori first-order factors were corroborated (interpersonal sensitivity; mistrust; ideas of reference; ideas of persecution). These mapped onto four classes of individual respondents: a rare, severe, persecutory class with high endorsement of all item factors, including persecutory ideation; a quasi-normal class with infrequent endorsement of interpersonal sensitivity, mistrust and ideas of reference, and no ideas of persecution; and two intermediate classes, characterised respectively by relatively high endorsement of items relating to mistrust and to ideas of reference.The paranoia continuum has implications for the aetiology, mechanisms and treatment of psychotic disorders, while confirming the lack of a clear distinction from normal experiences and processes."

I’ve know people with very high IQ’s who suffered some kind of social or moral deficit. I heard one guy say one time, “For someone who is supposed to be smart, how come I am so dumb?” There was a book written a few decades ago called “Emotional Intelligence”. It said that traits like perseverance, altruism, social grace, and respect for authority make more of a difference in your potential success than raw intelligence. I once met a guy who had an IQ of 158, and he was totally dysfunctional. I believed him when he said he had an IQ of 158 because he knew a lot of vocabulary that I didn’t, and I have a pretty good vocabulary. He wasn’t a nice person. They say that serial killers generally have a high IQ. The main thing is to find some kind of way in life where you are doing something you like at your job and you h

Then at 18 or 19 while in college I got a job at Hardee’s. Also in college I worked as a telemarketer while I was pregnant with my daughter. After she was born I always worked 1 or 2 jobs at a time since then. When I became disabled I was working full time and had a really good job.

If you’ve a history of addiction then it’s probably not a good option… Then there’s ssri’s. Not as effective in moments but better in the long run if they work. That is the problem with them. Can be good for long term anxiety and depression but not good as take as needed or prn…Talk to your doctor.

In Reason 10 we got a Grain sample-manipulator device that can turn any wav into something totally new/different. I have got 43 new clients in this year. It’s rewarding to get some cash for my hard work. Anyway, the basic process is just tweaking those knobs, faders and buttons til I get something cool and then just save the patch. Or if I make Loops and samples, I layer, automate and process something and then render into audio for the further tweaking. Then I just pack my patches and sounds with a refill packer and put them on my site for the people to buy."

She doesnt understand that all these lectures are way too much for me sometimes. Later on, i feel as a bad person too, cause i am not good enough to her and to even my friends. Well, its mostly my pain, who makes me act awkwardly so i probably am terrible with the people around me… But we should keep in mind, that to live ourselves as bad, is just a suffering… Maybe the cure against it, is to love ourselves more and just try to pull our heads out of the hole.

I am so thankful that I didn’t kill her. It could’ve been sooo bad. That ???? haunts me
175931038,I am sorry that nothing seems to work for you. The best you can do is tell yourself what they say is meaningless. They are just noise. I argue with my voices a lot but that doesn’t get me anywhere and usually just riles me up more. I have witnessed this in others as well. It is best to ignore and disregard. Disengage. Don’t fuel the fire. That doesn’t mean you have to ignore how they make you feel though. I encourage you to write about this or talk about it so you can vent those emotions.

I couldn’t handle my voices being gone, it really upset me. I feel very attracted to my voices and see them as many ways and one being my husband’s. So when they were gone, a huge part of me was gone. I told them and myself I would rather be sick and have you than well and not have you."

175931065,"Four score and seven years ago I was at work. Well actually, it was only just four years ago. I was emptying wastebaskets in the warehouse and all of sudden it hit me like a thunderbolt. I work in an Army Reserve office building amongst soldiers and our crew. And I thought, “Everybody here hates me.” I was a 100 percent sure of it. It was a really bad feeling but I had to just keep doing my job. And so I finished the wastebaskets and just kept going to work but I walked around with that feeling. And so a year went by thinking this. And I don’t think anyone deliberately took advantage of me but people were treating me different, a little condescending, a little superior. But funny enough, there were about three of the office workers who always greeted me and were always friendly during this time. But in my state of mind I thought they really were acting. But they were consistently nice. After a year, one day I was on my break sitting in the lobby and a woman who I had seen for the past two yea
rs saw me as she walked by and looked at me, gave me a big smile and said hi. And somehow it dawned on me that she was sincere. And I perked up and started looking at people closer and I realized that many people actually liked me. I came out of my depression and started smiling to people and saying hi. And I realized I had been wrong the whole year. And I started talking to people and cracking jokes again. Life turned good at work. This ending is kind of anti-climatic but now I thought that everybody liked me. And that’s how the last two years have been. I get to talk with everybody and be friendly and make people laugh. My friend at work even noticed the change and commented that I’m a lot friendlier. The anti-climatic part is that for the past week I’ve been thinking the reality might be that maybe 4 or 5 people might really like me and the rest are just polite or maybe just think I’m just OK. I know quite a few people dislike me but I get along with most people including my co-workers. So I don’

Life only has loose rules and we find our way among all those other things society gives us… What do you like? If you like something and your good at it then try to do something that brings you pleasure/happiness. I was paranoid for a long time so I did menial work. It gave me money etc but it wasn’t really a purpose…unless I was simply living the moment…not sure that gets you there in the end either

After spending about ten minutes with anyone my body goes into fight or flight mode and I have to leave to the situation to be alone. I can’t concentrate on something like the TV or magazines when sitting around with other people. My focus goes to where I’m looking and I can’t keep my gaze off other people. People in public cough at me like something’s wrong. Drivers make signs or press their brakes to alert me to my state. I tried to attend a class and I had to get up and walk out because I start to lose focus and focus on other people and I don’t want to make them uncomfortable. I try to look away from them but my peripheral is too strong. Diagnosed with schizophrenia in the spring when I had my first psycosis. I took olanzipine for four months now on Vraylar low dose. Are these signs of sz or what is wrong with me?

174335734,And is there any other medication besides ap and benzodiazepines that can make me feel less crazy and less depressed? The most depressing part about schizo is finding out that everything you believed is a lie.

You just got to laugh at that gerbil inside and not let him bother you or show signs you’re so excited I don’t think I’ve ever had pure mania to the extent I couldn’t control it and did tons of impulsive stuff.

For this, I keep a heating pad plugged in and laying on my bed and can just cut it on and apply it. You might want to buy a heating pad and apply it to your chest while laying down or sitting up watching TV. A moist heating pad might work better, by moistening the insert that comes with the heating pad, by putting water on it and squeezing it out. If there is no insert, you can take a small towel and moisten that. I think your doctor would have mentioned by now if it was your heart. After all, this happened right when you went off medicine. A warm bath could help, also. Heat expands the blood vessels, including those in the chest muscles, and that extra flow of oxygen and nutrients to the injured area could be a benefit."

174335746,"I have not heard of this, no. I would imagine if it were real, it would be rolled out across the board."
175931170,I used to take extra Zyprexa when in need. But now I am stable so no more need it. I think its a good idea when switching meds to prevent relapse.
175931171,No problem. 151t16261
175931172,Locked thread today… I am Mod.
174335756,I suggest you read _NAME_ Clear_PERSON_ book Atomic Habits. It’s a life changer.
175931173,I thought other people could read my mind. So I thought myself “mind control”. Pretty amazing what the brain can do
175931174,"When I weighed 96kg, I swear, that, the ap had an interaction with my obesity and low self confidence and that drove the negatives, in combination. I seriously believe that but I’m honestly not sure. Lol. I am now nearly normal weight and my negatives are less. But having SAID that, I am also on a lower ap dose."
175931175,I was on keto for like 5 days. Was very therapeutic. First 3 days was just liquids no protein. Got super nauseated from biofilm. Then nausea broke and I started eating meat. Day 6 now and I ran out of meat so I’m going fruitarian now. Downside is not optimal mood and oh the diarrhea.
175931176,I have an appointment in an hour.
175931177,I’m 59. But live and make descions by thinking “What would I have done when I was 17?” far too often. It was my last sane age. I can rise to the occasion and act like an adult more than I let on.
174335754,"Some pdocs give bupropion for sexual dysfunction. Try that. But dont if u have history of seizures. My libido is zero as well but I have decided to ignore it since I am more sane on current meds. I take paroxetine, clozapine and clobazam."
175931178,I get hiccups every week at least once. Does it have to do with food? Its annoying and sometimes its hard to breath. How do I stop it?
175931179,"I only know 2,mirtazapine and trazodone. Antidepressants is also for anxiety so If ur having anxiety insomnia it may help. Im on Mirtazapine and Valeriana myself."
175931180,In my early days of posting here i asked a question about the ccu ( community care unit). Looks like theres talk of me going here. My understanding is that it has 24/7 support with an almost hospital like treatmemt method though in a less restrictive setting. I wonder if anyone has been to this or equivalent during there life. Input would be cool. There are housing units which typically house 2 people. Regular psychiatric review. They typically work with people with dual diagnosis substance use disorders. Sorry just typing here. Let me know if u have heard anything about these rehab places This is in _NAME_ australia. Cheers

174335762,"I first saw a pdoc in the 4th quarter of 1973. I was put on Anafranil . First admission and being put on APs was May 1975. I’m supposedly in remission now, although how that gels with some breakthrough psychosis I don’t know . My situation has been complicated by _PERSON_’s which is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disability but was not diagnosed until this year."
175931186,"I always felt ashamed after looking at porn and regret it, I agree it’s damage to your spirit and soul"
175931187,I sleep well these days but used to sleep too long. I went from sleeping 10 hours or more to 8 hours or less by adding some decent exercise. I think that is pretty normal so most days I get 7-8 hours. Some days if there’s little happening and I’m still a bit tired I’ll have a 30 minute nap but not everyday. I feel guilty sleeping too much. I would rather the time awake for sure and I think 10 hours is too much compared to most.
175931188,My Depot was last week. When the nurse took the needle out there was a large jet of blood. It had nicked a blood vessel. Am starting to wonder if my meds were in the blood that came out
175931189,I have to budget carefully and live frugally but it’s worth it not to live with family or with someone helping me out.
175931190,I don’t feel any dumber with sz than before I had it I’m just now lazy as sh!t
175931191,So proud of you! Kit
175931192,_AT_MENTION_-Cotton … You’re under 18 yes they can you’re not an adult yet until then you’re at their mercy just saying
175931193,"Yeah we have this video feature....can I just say my webcam is ?*?? So terrible. Ok that was supposed to be facepalm but a girl, apparently they don’t have that option lol."
175931194,sorry if I’m repeating myself here… have you tried supplements? I find L-Theanine helpful and have sarcosine coming in the post. I know they’re just an adjunct to ap’s but I figure even a small improvement is significant to my quality of life.
175931195,"Sometimes I like to look back on how I was on this forum a year ago or two years ago. I remember back in 2018 I wanted to be more like a older friend of mine who was an accountant and married with kids. They lived in a nice home in the city. I wanted to work FT like her and have free time to go on outings or running at the beach, and to drive. I still want those things one day, but my functioning used to be so much better before my latest episode. Now I just look up to the people I meet at Women’s Group. Most of them work despite mental illness. I like how they talk about finances. I’d like to hustle at my job and buy a car and afford things like my own gas money every month. I’d also like to get on ssdi one day instead of ssi. I see single moms from group with mi and I feel like having kids would be worth it no matter what, one day. But for now I just want to be like the women in Women’s Group and really be able to take care of myself and pull my own weight at home and in life in general."
174335751,But they still diagnosed you with schizophrenia.
175931196,Thank you _USER_ID_
175931197,The boyfriend?..……….
175931198,I had tmj for years. I got braces and it went away
175931199,Definitely my divorce and losing my R.N. license.
175931200,I don't have any around but I can see about getting some to have just in case it happens again
175931201,previews on news or in your head.
175931202,"Prostate cancer risk is because these improves libido, increases semen volume, improves testosterone etc. Thus too much of sex hormone activity increases prostate cancer risk in some individuals that too in old age. Also you can find in internet that if not ejaculate regularly or masturbate then there is an increased chance of prostate cancer risk when reach old age. Can’t believe such reports fully as these only occur to a few so can’t generalize for all."
175931203,"No, I haven’t really had any conflicts. We have neighbors with a pair of kids living in a one bedroom so there’s lots of noise and even crying late at night. The older of the two kids likes to sprint across the apartment, we can hear him dash several times a day. I suppose I just tune it out. Happy cake day _AT_MENTION_!"
175931204,Best to go to gp ASAP about this one so it doesn’t spread
175931205,"Thanks, hon. I thought you thought that I thought that. Did that make sense? Lol"
175931206,Do you gain weight on risperidone ? What dosage do you take?
175931207,I like it _AT_MENTION_. Good stuff. Really communicates the essence of those experiences.
