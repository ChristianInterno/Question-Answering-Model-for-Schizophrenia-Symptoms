176170658,you really sound delusional to me…if you are taking meds and are in contact with a psychiatrist please say so…I think you need a med adjustment…tell your psychiatrist what you tell us and he or she can help you…trust the doctors…
174385786,"I found Abilify to be activating when I was on it, so I took it in the morning. Could that be keeping you awake? Also, I take 6 mg of Melatonin at bedtime, and it works for me. Zyprexa is activating for me, and I can’t get to sleep without my Melatonin."
176170659,Good job. Looks great.
176170660,That’s significant. You could bring that up if you ever want to seek a diagnosis
176170661,_AT_MENTION_. Can you ask your pdoc to review your meds with you and let you know what each med is for?
174385781,Abilify doesn’t interact with coffee like other meds so I’m not sure why I felt so good. I’ve used up all the coffee pods. They’re expensive though so I probably won’t order them again for ages. Because Im cheap. But at times I felt almost normal. I was drinking maybe 5 espresso shots a day though.
176170662,I’m just not feeling great. And I can’t sleep. It is 2am here. Watching my son playing “Fallout 4”. And listening to music.
176170663,Welcome to the forum!!! (Even if it is a belated welcome ). I’m glad it helps you
176170664,Interesting. Maybe it’ll help create more effective medications.
176170665,I took some Ibuprofen last night before bedtime. Maybe that’s the trick to not hurting in the morning when I get up.
176170666,"When I switched off Zyprexa last summer, it did about the same to me. My pdoc put me on just 5mg of Abilify. I’m now taking 15mg and doing fine at that level."
176170667,Happy to hear you’re getting some relief from your symptoms.
176170668,Let the drs figure it out for you
176170669,When I was about 10 I snuck a peek in my parents closet and found out what my gift was early and felt bad for looking when I opened it and found a PlayStation exactly what I had wanted but it wasn’t the same

Independent Lens Bedlam | Examining Our Mental Health Crisis | Independent Lens | PBS Examine the mental health crisis through intimate stories of people in-and-out of ERs, jails and homeless camps. "" About the Film To get to the bottom of the current mental health crisis in the U.S., psychiatrist and documentarian _NAME_, M.D. chronicles the personal, poignant stories of those suffering from serious mental illness, including his own family, to bring to light to this epidemic and possible solutions. Shot over the course of five years, _PERSON_ takes viewers inside Los Angeles County’s overwhelmed and vastly under-resourced psych ER, a nearby jail warehousing thousands of psychiatric patients, and the homes — and homeless encampments — of people affected by severe mental illness, where silence and shame often worsen the suffering. _PERSON_ follows the lives of three patients in particular who find t
hemselves with a chronic lack of institutional support while weaving in his own story of how the system failed his late sister, _NAME_, and her battle with schizophrenia. Featuring interviews with experts, activists, individuals living with a mental illness, and their families, Bedlam builds on historical footage and commentary related to mental health, exploring the rise of this issue on a national scale in the mid- and late 20th century."""
176170674,I think he’s saying that you need to get comfortable with holding yourself accountable. Do what you think you should whether or not anyone is watching.

174385783,I’m the exact same and I’m on abilify too. I wrote a poem about it today in fact! The best advice I can give you is to quit coffee. I felt the cycle was broken when I was off coffee.
176170676,Are you _PERSON_? Did you kill anyone? What have you done so awful? What is so wrong with you? Now if that same thing was wrong with another person would you forgive them? Would you still like them? Would you still see their value? Are you holding yourself to a higher standard than other people? Do you think for some reason you should have to do better just to be accepted and loved? Do you think that you should be more responsible and accountable than other people? Or do you judge everyone so harshly? Do you have a hard time having positive feelings towards other people too? These are some of the things you can explore to start with to find out why you don’t like yourself. I struggle with not liking myself very much. I’m flawed. I’m lazy. I have to try to be nice. I’m self centered. I’m weak. I was also abused as a little girl and I think that really effects the way I see myself. But since my abuser died I can also see that I have good in me too. I always try to be a better person and to b
e kind and I think that’s important. Maybe when your abuser is brought to his ultimate justice you’ll see you deserve to be happy.

176170679,Maybe you should talk to your doctor about a med. change. The symptoms you describe sound like tardive disconesia. (spelling?) You shouldn’t have to endure that if there are alternatives.
176170680,Same here. I’d rather meet my psychiatric team in person. Perhaps the drug needs to build up in your system but be careful. Not eating or not feeling thirst is a bad sign. Also if you stop sleeping then you need to go to the ER.
176170681,Thanks for the replies everyone.

176170694,"Watching TV used to be very interesting because I would see the eyes of the people changing colour regularly, from a vivid bright blue to almost neon green, to golden and reddish-gold, to reddish black and then completely all black, with blackened eye sockets too. I did think that someone was messing with my TV and was suspicious until I started seeing the same eye colour changes happening to people around me in real life, but sometimes to only half their faces. I felt the energy of another entity in those instances, which made it a bit hard to communicate sometimes because I didn’t know whether it was the person I was directing my conversation to sometimes or the entity/spirit superimposed over their face. I also had words morph into sigils/symbols and other languages on the TV and in any type or media, like books and magazines. These actually turned out to be real and relevant because they were sacred geometry (the building blocks of the entire universe) or actual ancient alphabets/languages li
ke the Enochian alphabet and ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, which I discovered when I researched some of what I’d been seeing. I think this was all partly due to a spiritual awakening, and the universe was trying to show me how we are all connected to everything."

If you’re worried about fitting in, well, the other addicts are in there for a reason and probably don’t have a great background or history either. But you all have a common goal. In AA they always used to say in meetings, “Stick with the winners”. I’ve never been in rehab myself but I’ve met many people who have. Sometimes you have people in programs who aren’t seriously trying to quit. They may be in there because they are court ordered or they are trying to get their family off their back and aren’t serious about quitting. Avoid those types and hang with the people who are seriously trying to quit and change their lives."

176170802,"I’m from Poland. From above 4,5 years I have something which may look as delusions of reference or (and) messengership and grandiosity. In September 2014 I started to experience notorious coincidences. First ones may look as relatively “weak” in comparison to younger ones, for example those with Big Hole and Giant Egg from last months. 19.9.2014 I made relatively large number of photos using smartphone. They might be useful in MSc thesis (but I not used them in that finally). On some of them there were Jewish matzevahs with Hebrew letters, on one there was fragment of Catholic cementery with crosses. It was day of the week which is the day of Crucifixion of Christ and the day of the week which is considered most important by many Muslims (what I knew at 2014, I also knew earlier that number 19 is considered special by some Muslims, the coincidence was associated with facts from 19th day of the month and from the date two numbers 19 can be formed, it is only one such day of week which is 19th 
in month and has digits for two 19s in its date during some thousands of days). September is somewhat specially dedicated to Holy Cross and 14th day of that month is Feast of the Cross, it was 14th year in 21th century. So the coincidences associated with 19.9.2014 were associated with three biggest monotheist and abrahamic religions: Christianity, Islam, Judaism. I might have an idea that I am the apostle for followers of these religions especially (but rather not only, also to for example atheists, Hinduists, Buddhists, animists). What is more about events of 19.9.2014, I used the same smartphone to look at posts of certain aspijka (woman with _PERSON_’s, ASD or similar condition) about 11 p.m. the same day. In some of posts there were photos of… Jewish or Catholic cementeries! There were matzevahs with Hebrew writings and crosses. In addition, the youngest post of that woman which contained word “cmentarze” (“cementeries”) or maybe “cmentarz” (“cementery”) was from 19.7.2013 (in summer 
time which was used 19.9.2014), it was the same day of the week, exactly 14 months earlier! Again 14 [14 became pretty coincident number later]."

Your treatment is your choice. I cannot force you to seek treatment. I’m some stranger on the internet who are just concerned about your well-being because you seem to be around the age of my onset. I want to tell you this: when I did not seek the help that I need, my condition deteriorated, and I was wrapped by the thought of paranoia and delusions 24/7. I was hearing voices that were telling me to harm myself. I could not study and I was in hospital for a long time. Please, if you do not want to go down that route, I just want to help you to seek the treatment that you need and get treated right away. You’re in a safe environment right now, and you are in good hands. People are not out to get you. You’re just having symptoms and you deserve a safe space.

So I was thinking I wouldn’t clean so I could get kicked out into the street and jump into the river. But now things are really looking up and I see I have an opportunity to make something out of myself after all. But I’m used to having no responsibility and can’t get off my butt and clean.

The other thing is I am tingly, my hands feel tingly when I touch things and even when I don’t I am aware of kind of a static field around my entire body. This is something I haven’t really felt before and didn’t feel during psychosis when I was going through it way back when. I want more examples of distorted perception so I can compare my own state to it and be able to say “yes, its like that”. I haven’t found many discriptional examples of thought distortions, if anyone has examples I would appreciate it if you could send them my way.

While my boyfriend is at work during the day I sleep because I actually can and there’s nothing else I want to do. The few happy hours of my day are spent with him. Then its bedtime and the cycle repeats itself. I can’t stand the not being able to do anything. I’ll think of literally any of my hobbies and they all seem so unappealing. Life seems boring and unbearable. All I want to do is sleep and dream. I guess I am depressed.

Instead of trying to talk to me once, even by phone, one of my half sisters called a family meeting without me and talked about putting me in a group home. my half siblings are very much on the antisocial spectrum. luckily my father shut down the idea. seeing as I’m very stable and doing well, possibly will be working within a couple more months of stability, can they without much evidence have me locked up?

Opiates, marijuana, and psychedelics actually create a decrease in violence it seems. But opiate and marijuana WITHDRAWAL can cause increase in violence. But a lot of it seems to be based on the area and type of user. A lot more urban cocaine use than shrooms use for example. And typically more violence in urban areas There are a lot of flaws I’d say in any of these studies (in regards to the idea that one statistic can be manipulated a certain way to influence biases) Maybe as a whole drugs increase violence. But if most our population of drug users were middle class hallucinogen users, they’d be calling drug users “too passive” rather than “dangerous”."

174385887,"It’s saying that the _PERSON_’s first-rank symptoms (listed in the abstract) were misused in the DSM and ICD, where they were defined as delusions, when they actually are subjective experiences that can’t be reduced to just delusional behavior, and that while it may have been correct to remove them from the diagnostic manuals, the actual first-rank symptoms as _PERSON_ conceived of them and _PERSON_’s own criteria for categorizing them have not been sufficiently researched and may still be useful in improving the diagnostic accuracy of schizophrenia. _PERSON_’s first-rank symptoms as they were used in the DSM and ICD were special cases of delusional behavior though to be more specific to schizophrenic psychoses than to non-schizophrenic psychoses, and only one of these were required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as opposed to at least two of the other symptoms listed."

176171121,"Within ten years, the first aging reversal therapies that actually work will have passed their final stage clinical trials. They may only add five extra years of so to life, but they point to a future in which humans can potentially live for much greater extended periods of time. I find the issue of healing fascinating and far from obvious about what is the best course of action. Within sickness there are lessons and within lessons attachments. Death is the ultimate form of transcendence from attachments. Is the idea of healing to ensure a good death or a prolonged life? I know two people suffering from dementia at present, one is _PERSON_, and the other, a family friend who was a doctor. Dementia is a loss of self-narrative. Psychologically it comes from failure to adapt to changing accounts of history with reference to self. I see it as coming externally from the world reinterpreting itself in a way that excludes the sufferer who finds they cannot hold on to their interpretation in the face of su
ch change. Of course there are biochemical changes too, but fundamentally I see the spiritual dimension as a resistance to change. Change is a part of life, but there can be constructive change and destructive change, and it may be that for one person the change is the former and for another, the change the latter. Thus dementia can be viewed as an injustice if it stems from changes that benefit someone else at the sufferer’s expense. However, dementia usually affects the old, and dementia is usually the result of the new generation making changes that disrupt the older generation. This brings me back to the question of aging reversal, and whether the aim of healing is to ensure a good death or a prolonged life. Maybe the answer is both. Fundamentally, healing is about removing suffering, helping people learn the lessons of their sickness and transcend them."

This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Volunteer Moderator _AT_MENTION_"

176171174,"There’s a lot of rights being broken every day. I’m a US citizen and my ancestry goes as far back as the civil war. Why should I be treated like a terrorist in my own country if i didn’t even commit a crime? The fear of “mass shootings” is doctored bs. You wanna know how many mass shootings there were since 2000? About 60. Out of all the guns in this country, that’s astronomically low. And given the fact that people with mental illness are more likely to be victimized in a violent crime than perpetrators, disarming them is only gonna make it worse. Especially when the offender has a gun. Breaking the law if it’s unconstitutional isn’t really “breaking the law” is it? If the law is at odds with the founding fathers then it isn’t “the law” at all."

They would just look at me and say, "" I never said/did that…"". I would insist that I had just seen them say/do something but they would counteract that with being sure that they didn’t. It seems these beings can mess with each person’s own reality. This includes all senses in this “dimension/reality/universe” and other inner senses that may correlate with the ether and other dimensions/realities/universes, etc. This is just what I have experienced and have felt is what makes sense from what I have gone through in combination of daytime entity phenomena as well as wh
at they do to me on other planes of existence during the night. It is extremely hard for me to explain more in depth a lot of what they do, but it is aggravating because I can’t open up to the average person about this. It is very real and not a hallucination. I’ve seen hallucinations before and they are nothing to the wide range of phenomena these entities manipulate day in and out.

174385947,"On 24 May 2018, quite out of the blue, a guilt ray pierced through my soul and I knew almost immediately that I was undone. The day had not been a particularly stressful one, things were going well. A week later I was in hospital down with severe depression. A few hallucinations and a full-blown, albeit, brief psychotic episode later, I was diagnosed first with schizotypal disorder, and then schizophrenia. Everything I’ve experienced since then seems to hinge on this original guilt -which I identify now with the sinful creation of the universe. I don’t hear voices or believe in paranoid conspiracies, but I do believe, or a significant part of me (please see “double bookkeeping in delusions”) does, that the universe is but an illusion brought out by my fiery dialogue with the devil very much like Jesus in the desert. I’ve been for 3 months at hospital, up to my eyeballs with APs but the guilt has remained constant. The psychologist gave up on me arguing that she’d rather wait for the APs 
to kick in, as there was in her judgement a psychotic dimension to my guilt. And yet my guilt is based on real events that took place in my life (disclaimer: nothing illegal). What “voices” has been to others, guilt is to me, always there, viscose, unravelleing. What’s your take on “guilt of delusional intensity”? As you can see I’m grasping here at straws, desperate for a closure none of my medical carers seem able to provide. All feedback is welcome. I promise this will be my last post on the subject."

I wont get into it too much and start preaching on the forum, but at this point i do not respect the modern technological society or the people who mindlessly keep it going. Im young so i may be a fool (very possible). But i just think its more important to do what makes you feel alive. If you feel alive, you will not hunger for that 100k/yr salary, or whatever it is that causes jealousy specifically for you. Idk. We each have our own path. I believe humans have the ability to appreciate the ongoing ‘wow’ that is life more than other species, yet as animals we experience it the least of all of them. Why do i think this? Because people go home from work and drink beer while watching tv and tell themselves thats good enough for them. Though, again, I could just be a fool.

When I dream, I wake up thinking I’m a Cylon lol, but I relate more and prefer _PERSON_ lol. It strokes my ego of course… You should watch Travelers on Netflix. All that stuff triggers me, but I feel like it’s all real or could be real…at least some of it…in the multiverse…which is why I just watch clips and trailers on youtube. I also don’t have the attention span. One of my favorite movies is the original “Matrix”. I felt like “Neo” before, even though I am not him. I relate to too many fictional characters. I think I come off misunderstood and delusional. I feel sad and embarassed because of it. Like I don’t really understand “Me”. I had a mental breakdown 10 years ago and just feel like I’m in a endless timeloop/causal loop via mind travel into my body – same body – living the same life ad infinitum restarting back to 2011 when I got my 
schizophrenia. So I always am schizophrenic in every life and I don’t know what it’s like to ‘not be schizophrenic’ which is saddening to me… I had dreams that schizophrenia was caused by the norovirus, but I don’t know really. It was just a dream. Maybe God told me or it was a gift to humanity. They’re coming out with a vaccine. Maybe I’m wrong. I also have the intense delusion I live in a computer simulation and escaped it and even ran part/some of it before in a distant past life. It’s all crazy stuff."

176171333,"In other lumateperone news, phase 3 results for Bipolar Depression are expected the week of July 8-12. “ITCI has a number of binary events ahead this quarter, some of which are only about a week away. In week of July 8, there are top-line results for 2 phase 3 trials in bipolar depression (BPD) (one U.S. only and one international). We feel that there is a lot of uncertainty in these readouts for the following reasons: First, although there is some data on depression-related readouts in some ITI-007 schizophrenia trials (see e.g. CDSS scores in Table 2 of the Phase 2 trial publication), there is no prior BPD data for ITI-007, which is unusual for a molecule in a phase 3 trial; Second, ITI-007 has a very complex mechanism of action that to us makes it more unpredictable in an indication where there has been no prior human clinical data for this therapeutic candidate; and third, we are concerned regarding a high placebo effect, which has been difficult to control in CNS trials and which ITCI saw re

I have a son who’s grown and living far from me now, but I’m his mother and I will not leave him a legacy of desperation and loss. He may see me struggle but he’ll never see me give up. He will see me stay through each cycle of depression over and over. He’ll see me win every time, even if it’s winning a life of hardship, it’s still winning. You can do this. You love your kids.

Before sz I used to do night jogs. I’ve always had social anxiety and also difficulty in reading social cues. I’m paranoid. It’s terrible. I can’t coordinate myself. I take trileptal and lamictal. These two anticonvulsants have calmed me down…still I’m delusional. I wrote out 2000 words of my delusions, because _AT_MENTION_ does that. Reading or thinking about them does not make them go away. It’s traumatic. I have intrusive thoughts. I’m putting faith in trileptal…I’m at only 900mg/day today. I’m impulsive and mad at times. There is no filter. I feel like the center of attention, that’s okay because I’m a good center of attention and everyone loves me. I believe that when I enter depression, that I’ll not be able to get past the hard thoughts and realities. I can’t read social cues, I’m not pat
ient, I can’t lie. I say “I’m not impressed, dad you’re a liar, mom you’re an unusual lady”. That ruins my social standing in the family. I’ve lost parts of my autobiographical memory in something called “anterograde amnesia”. I think things can get better for 3 reasons: -I’ve withdrawn from ativan in april (benzo withdrawal can cause lasting cognitive damage (memory and focus…emotion) which will get somewhat better over time -I was manic and untreated for 7 months (since november) and if one can achieve euthymia (somewhat uncommon, I think) or some degree of stabilization then they may find that cognition improves -I am on 2 anticonvulsants, these medications can adversely impact cognition. One of my hopes for cognition is that I can rebuild within the year and after, by just letting my brain heal from some of the stress which may contributed to the cognitive impairment -fish oil -vitamin d -exercise -sleep -anticonvulsants -gradual return to normal social activities -social activities 
which don’t involve reading social cues or stress memory, also online education resources I got 4 new games at the bottom there, I read that they can help with cognition (action games) IMG_3195.PNG.jpg 750×1334 206 KB My other hope is that these medications, especially trileptal at 1200mg, will help me stabilize, and hopefully without getting on atypical antipsychotics (seroquel) as they cause intrusive thoughts for me"

Vitamin C causes an increase of TGF-Beta activation (potentially causing bone spurs,) and Niacin reduces TGF-Beta activation. You probably shouldn’t megadose them individually, and if you’re going to supplement both you should do it within a reasonable amount. Dr. _PERSON_ recommends 1 gram 3 times a day of both."

That place had come to stress me out terribly; I dreaded going to work. I might do it, though, ask him if I can work Thursday and Friday nights. It would most likely be short-term, since I hope to move away from this area and closer to the old college soon.

174386016,For me it’s more of a social _USER_ID_ for us physically disabled folks. We are often very conscious of ourselves. Being in a wheelchair or walking funny can sometimes gather unwanted attention. Oh people also ask really inappropriate questions. My schizophrenia kinda adds onto it as well. I thought people were using me to extract ideas or something.
174386017,Yes my negatives improved after lowering my dose. It took 2 months for me to notice significant changes.
174386021,It was the alcohol that made me vomit on my friends. I can control myself now and I was drinking while on Abilify but now on Risperdal it gives me bad headaches so I don’t drink at all.

176171516,I think I am going to begin brainstorming a fantasy novel.
174386025,"I had a CMHT in the UK. I now live in France but this is relatively recent so have some points to add. The treatment was quite good, until they decided to send me for a second assessment by a senior doctor. He changed my medication to Abilify and this led to me having a violent relapse. They used to come to my home, did you have this setup? Made sure I was taking my medication, which I was. One of the dangers of having a Community psychiatric nurse (CPN) is that they often have their own agenda at play, for instance my CPN tried to get me sent into rehab. Yet seeing as I’m compliant with medication, rehab would make no sense. I had to win a tribunal to get out of my last stay in a psychiatric hospital. Otherwise I would now be in rehab."
176171517,I might have suffered from a mini stroke like 2 years ago. I was lying down on my bed and trying to exercise and then when I got up I was partially blind in one eye and suffered a headache. The blindness lasted for hours. I eventually got better hours later. I really should have seeked out medical attention but I didn’t.
176171518,"I have a lot of bitterness about my situation that I’m working to resolve. Psychosis completely upended my life and sent me into a world of needing accommodations and intensive treatment that I never would have dreamed of requiring prior to falling ill. Was a massive blow to my pride, admittedly. I’m slowly reaching a point of acceptance about it all though."
176171519,Me too. My only fear right now is death.

You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn’t get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don’t get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree. The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying “You’re too this , or I’m too this .” That judging mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.” - _PERSON_"

176171523,"I am doing it with the NHS too. I waited a very long time for it, but I am not sure it’s working out well at all. I have an autism assessment now as the psychologist thinks this may be an issue. She is the first person in 32 years who has suggested that as far as I know."

176171525,"Yeah it could be, honestly it’s a complicated symptom imo. But I can say this cigs make medicine less effective, atleast its what I heard and the doctors don’t know _NAME_ on how to help me with it.

Eccentricity is contrasted with normal behavior, the nearly universal means by which individuals in society solve given problems and pursue certain priorities in everyday life.

One way or another, meds or therapy, you have to break the pattern. Whenever i ruminate, i try simply to stop it and listen to the silence, the emptiness that follows. Another way to weaken the negative thoughts, is trying to avoid thinking about the future and lost failures. A banality, yes, but live from moment to moment."

I ran out for two days and they let me do Appt over phone real quick. The nurse didn’t want to up my dosage as I seemed or related to her that I am sleeping finally through the night and not hallucinating or having delusions. I thought I was fine But…I notice when I’m alone I still talk to myself. I still have a running commentary on everything and music plays it’s just the shouting went away. I am not having full on hallucinations anymore but my eyes may still be playing tricks on me. I felt peaceful and am still very creative. But am I on the edge? I have misplaced something of value to me and I’m having paranoid thoughts about 
my family or someone else taking it. I don’t trust easily and well, their responses aren’t very convincing. I’ve just began to realize I have a bad habit of charging everyone guilty until proven innocent and I’m going crazy inside with doubts and suspicion. Would a medicine increase help with this? If so should I burden my doctor with a phone call? I just got my script filled it seems. I am trying to be more aware of my illness.

I haven’t gained any weight on it but thats because of how my body metabolizes medications. I have been happy with being on clozapine. I have schizoaffective disorder mixed bipolar type and it has helped a lot. There are still lingering psychotic symptoms but it has helped so much with having episodes. note that this medication will knock you the hell out. If i take my clozapine at night, with no plans or anything for the next day i will sleep like…12-17 hours at a time (or more). Getting out of bed is the hardest part on this med. I take vyvanse to help wake me up because i cannot stand the lingering grogginess that i often

176171651,"Thanks! I haven’t felt comfortable to share my music on the hip hop forums till lately. You get some harsh critics there. But I felt comfortable feeling this and a few others. Getting some rough criticism at times, others are encouraging but I try to take into account all criticisms. Only way to get better."

176171653,Sometimes I get this very uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. It is a very uncomfortable feeling and could be described as a sort of anxiety. I wonder if this kind of uneasiness/fear is part of the illness or what. Does anyone else get this?
174386068,"Try niacin(vitamin b-3), 1g three times per day with each meal, and 1g vitamin c with each meal too. Based on treatment by a psychiatrist called _NAME_ who used to treat schizophrenia with these doses of niacin. I take more niacin, he said its possible to increase to more than 3g per day. Seemed to help with my negative and positive symptoms but tried to stop medication and ended up back in the hospital. Still really helps me though, i dont think I would be nearly as functional without it."
176171654,That does sound pretty stressful? Glad you made it through the day!
174386067,Yes exactly this one most potent for reducing blunted affect. Its hard to get when compared with other brands. It contains Sharp-PS brand phosphatidylserine which is the best. Other brands uses different versions though all labelled phosphatidylserine.

174386079,"https://hms.harvard.edu/news/biological-origin-schizophrenia I wonder how this factors in with the immune system, norovirus, and drug use. I lived lives where I had schizophrenia in high school. Makes sense when ‘they’ told me I’m in hell for substance use. In this life, in college, I tried marijuana and other stuff 8 years ago and got severe psychosis. I never recovered. I wonder if my life will be different and be better and change in 1-2 years if I’m cured. I don’t know. I’m going to take the vaccine anyways even if there is little to no evidence. I think I have that c4 issue stated in the article. I guess I’m very unlucky. It rings a slight bell."

My community nurse suggested yesterday to see if I could have one on the NHS and he already knew the answer.

I’m not saying my goal is to get rid of the internet, but I’m trying to stay offline certain times of the day so that I get other things done. If I need to check something out on the net I just write it down and check it out when I’m “allowed”. At least that’s the plan."
176171671,i am afraid he take risk and give me potent meds to cause me strong side effects or even disturbing side effects that happened before
174386074,I switched from Abilify to papperidone. There were no side effects or drawbacks.
176171672,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ she picked a really bad time to turn up
176171673,Some people have no ability to care about others. On top of it that get a thrill out of killing.
176171674,"I’m the same as _AT_MENTION_! I definitely remember the torture I went through. It was a hard labor and I tore completely on the inside and outside. I also swore never again. It was pure hell. I think you should speak to a counselor about your thoughts because they sound imbalanced and unhealthy. You need to be honest about all your thoughts with the counselor too, or you won’t get the help you need. First focus on getting healthy and then you can start making efforts to be with someone."
174386082,That’s good news. 10mg is the minimum dose for schizophrenia.

I am on Invega but I am not on it because I have been diagnosed Schizophrenic. I was put on it as a last ditch effort to stop self harming and because I was having psychosis. I actually never noticed my voices until they lowered my Invega dose from the highest dose to 78mg every 30 days. None of my treatment providers seem to think that has anything to do with anything. My voices are like thoughts just like when you are thinking. They just say random stuff, some of it repetitive, some seem childish like I want Spaghetti Os when I haven’t liked them in a long time. Some is referring to myself in third person. I also get in fights about things in my head between some thoughts. Like I am battling with someone who is not there. Or parts of me are fighting. I was wondering if any of you were familiar with this. Somet

I find, that i have some slight progress, but it should be really much better… I somatize a lot in fact and i wish this goes away… But somatization is linked to thinking i guess and for this, i should be patient? My illness was old, maybe thats why the ap didnt work in months… I am here, waiting for the ap to work, once i am used to its side effects too, but i wonder if aps work on this even physical pain? Well, i am in physical pain cause i have a soul disease i find too, but the ap will end up by working, isnt it?

176171683,I posted a similar post tonight. I don’t have any advice but I wanted to reply because you’re not alone in this. It’s hard.
176171684,"Yes. Most of the decisions I’ve made have turned out pretty bad. One of the worst was back in the summer of 1982 when grandfather died. My uncle _NAME_ thought I should be paying rent, and he put my grandmother up to asking me for rent when she was emotionally distraught after her husband of over 50 years died. I refused and moved out, having to pay rent to a real estate company and buy furniture, pots, pans, dishes, linens on credit. Then I moved in a really bad roommate. I lost my job in September, but they paid me through December. I could only find a job out of state. I would have been much better off if I stayed at home and paid grandmother rent. I wouldn’t have gotten in all the trouble I did, and I would not have had to move out of state."

176171687,I drank her cup of coffee and nothing happened.
176171688,I feel for you _AT_MENTION_ .
176171689,limited not to a minimum.
176171690,I haven’t been on here long but I like it. It’s been good for me seeing posts and comments so close to my own experiences. I feel much more “normal” knowing that I’m part of a group of people who experience life similar to me. So thanks for all that you share. I don’t feel so strange of a person any more.
176171691,I’m guilty of being a bad friend due to my drug use. But I had one or two who stuck by me and really that’s all I need. What’s formula one? Is that like nascar?
176171692,What scares me is when I was at the hospital I heard an internal voice that said I was being transferred to a certain hospital with a certain name. That ended up being true. This is why I worry that I will be sent to North Korea in 11 years because of what I heard and how one of my voices ended up being true. I never heard of the hospital name so this is hard to believe as being my subconscious.
176171693,"Because of covid-19, I was tested for it while in hospital, I was sure that they planted something in me as I didn’t have a close look at the tester. I am worried about being tracked. I also did hallucinate a dodge muscle car, it showed up and I went back inside my apt building to get my fake gun. But it just rev’d its engine a bit outside my window and then floored it. I went looking for it for some reason and decided not to, but on the way back to my parking spot, I noticed two guys with machetes hiding behind a truck. I drove straight to the hospital… I am planning on going to a rehab recovery program in the bigger city next to me that is thankfully still open during covid-19 restrictions. Right now, If I could I would be using it. It’s the best feeling on earth and I truly hate that that is my answer. Hopefully I stay away and get into treatment for my addiction before going back down the rabbit hole. Meth is truly powerful, but is entirely evil."
176171694,Always be 100% honest with doctors. They can’t help you otherwise.
176171695,I dunno…I would think you would have more freedom? No?

176171698,"I doubted people were real because I thought I was a tiny quantum seed constructing a reality for the purposes of finding the flaws within my real life’s journey. Basically a pre-planning stage which outlines what I will do in the real life. Still think this happened, but I’m pretty sure now I’m actually living the “real” life not the pre-planning one. Be careful thinking people are not real. If the’re real then you might hurt others with the idea that they aren’t. (BTW people are real) Act as if every simulation is real, then you can’t go wrong."

176171701,"How well do you do cleaning your own house? My wife refuses to do housework. She is just lazy. I don’t particularly care for it but I keep the kitchen clean, vacuum the floors, wash and dry the clothes, empty the litter boxes and do the trash. I also dust. My wife says I don’t do the dishes or the laundry well enough but it’s not bad enough that she does it. I turn all of our socks pink. Don’t do colors and whites. Never have enough whites for a whole load. If I was doing it for someone else and for money I would probably have to do a better job. You might even be able to make more money if you also prepare a meal for the people for when they get home from work. One of my wife’s best friends is a neat freak and keeps a house worthy of being in a magazine. She cleans houses for a living and loves it. She does a good job."

176171709,"That’s an incredibly naive way of thinking about self-control, _AT_MENTION_. While our self-control is only minimally under direct conscious control, it is under significant indirect control. When we believe that we can do things, and make up our minds to try, we can make conscious changes in our lives that make those attempts much more likely to be successful. We’re not just passive recipients of what life decides to do with us. We have control over some things, but only when we also believe that we have some control over those things."
176171710,What do you mean _AT_MENTION_? What’s going on?
174386095,If benzos reduce negative symptoms my pdr would have already prescribed it to me. He said there is no meds for negative symptoms yet and I trust him.
176171711,"I did the editing re-write excerpt. I have a headache now. Whittling and re-writing are not easy tasks. I suck at it. Lol! But, I was reviewing my peers’ writing. They are terrible too. So, all I can do is moan and groan. I was tired for most of the day. I moved around and felt better. I am glad I turned in the writing assignment. I am doing fine now. I prepped for tomorrow’s lessons. My editing skills need a lot more practice. I will do my best. Does anybody else like to write? What do you write about? I want to write about facts. I am not creative so I want to just deal with non-fiction writing. How about you?"

174386090,That’s caused much more by schizophrenia itself.
176171713,It took me a long time and many pills till I got on top of my depression. That wasn’t an easy time of my life but I got through and found something that worked well. Modern psychiatry can be hit or miss but it’s worth trying things to get improvement. I’d be talking to your doctor and maybe trying something else to help.

176171718,Some days _PERSON_ does nothing for me. My intrusive thoughts are intense.
176171719,I am suffering from intrusive thoughts too. I hate them. Maybe try to do something you enjoy like go out for an iced coffee or tea. I fear people can read these thoughts and they are not understanding. I am mortified when people can do things to me.
176171720,They should put that song in a movie like The Soloist. It really describes us well. People who don’t have SZ would understand more just by listening.
176171721,Is this a symptom of schizophrenia? For the last couple of years this has progressed. Now I’m at the point where I rarely talk.

Today for instance, i saw my mom in the evening, which didn’t happen since years… I went out also to the pharmacy. I need my time. Cause one of my symptoms before was to rush and it was crazy too… I cant hide from myself. Even if i change the environment, i wont hide from myself… I was just asking if its possible to have more anxiety and paranoia as a side effect?"
176171731,"Yes, it is scary. I worry about being mistreated too but just because I’m considered schizoaffective."
176171732,"My brother-in-law has insomnia as well. He said, that when he worked out(exercised) his insomnia got better."
176171733,"You need to stop worrying so much about the voices. First of all, others can’t cause your voices. Second, the voices aren’t real, they’re in your head. Third, you’ve been voice free for a while now. If you keep fixating on them like you do you’re gonna bring them back. And last, you need to try to fight your delusions and instead of defending why they’re real, try to defend why they might not be."

176171741,80 sounds like a ton. I only had 6 sessions.
176171742,I am sorry to hear that.
176171743,Yes I feel under threat when I’m paranoid. I’m scared and feel threatened by my mother in law whom I believe is waiting for the right moment to poison me. Even though she acts ok around me and isn’t unfriendly I still am scared of her. And once I believed the two men who were sitting in the ladies section in mosque were gunmen in league with the imam. Needless to say I was terrified of them.
176171744,I don’t think you can get testosterone here in the US without a doctor’s prescription.

The people in this universe are unique and separate from me, doing their own things. I no longer think they’re all “linked” to me and my thoughts. It took successful treatment to feel like this."
176171750,my point is that they ask useless questions
176171751,"I imagine the reason that the studies only happening at universities, is that large pharmaceutical companies stand to lose so much money They would be fuelling their own demise"
176171753,I think you could talk to your pdoc about possibly increasing your dose of sertraline to help with your anxiety. That is prescribed for anxiety disorders. What dosage are you on?
176171754,Yeah after so long they know that they’re not going to get their money so if they get a portion after tax time it’s better than nothing. I don’t know exactly how write offs work

176171761,Are there restrictions on leaving and going where you want to go?
176171762,"Hey _AT_MENTION_. Personality disorders are curable or at least treatable, but only if the person suffering from it has insight. With insight they can participate in behavioural adjustment programmes which will work on their attitudes and behaviour. However, if they don’t have insight, then unfortunately they are just going to continue their usual manner. What can you do about it? Well, that’s a hard one seeing as she shares the same housing as you. All i can suggest is that you try to avoid her as much as possible."
176171763,idk she was hospitalized
176171764,"Funny, some propose a person’s thoughts can be recognized through technological advancement. I suppose it is true such as a person paralyzed from the neck down using ocular movement to express simulated thoughts for fear of being left alone or abandoned."
174386105,i have positive symptoms more that affects me than negative… I do have negative though.
176171765,"We had an employee let go from one of the branches in our hub late last year for negative posts about the company. I checked out her profile after the fact and she was full on whackdoodle. She was publicly attacking everything and everyone, harrassed people online that she disagreed with, and couldn’t shut up about using weed. Her posts about our employer were just … wow. No employer is going to be able to keep everyone happy all of the time, but mine actually does a pretty good job of working for the right balance. They’ve handled the COVID crisis extremely well and have gone out of their way to be open and supportive. They also recently really improved our benefits and lowered the cost for us. Finally, at the start of the COVID mess, they announced they were going to move ahead with performance bonuses despite knowing a financial hit was coming. It shows that they value their staff and want to keep them in the long term. So what this lady was posting, yeah. I can see why they bounced her. S

174386106,_AT_MENTION_ says it pretty well. You don’t think much of us before you even know us. I read your whole post and tried to understand but it was almost as if you weren’t saying anything. You weren’t ranting but while reading the main body of it it was like you were spinning your wheels and had no point. Which is OK. Mental illness and especially schizophrenia in particular can cause that in a person. We’re here to support and we can overlook a lot of stuff in a person as people overlook our delusions too.

176171787,"_AT_MENTION_, I’ve never heard of a sz person being prescribed dopamine agonists as it could produce other physical effects. I mean, talk to your doctor about it but this seems like a bad idea. The reason why my doctor prescribed L-DOPA/Carbidopa to me is because I had spasticity that couldn’t be resolved with standard muscle relaxant, i.e. baclofen. I’m also on another parkinsonic med to solve my spasticity issues. And despite that, I still get stiff muscles here and there. Because my doctor knows the risks associated with the medicine I’m taking, I’m taking very little amounts of it (he’s very familiar with Parkinson’s disease-related neuropsychiatric symptoms) and he told me to report any unusual side effects. It could also cause movement disorders so it should be very carefully managed. But seriously, please don’t take L-DOPA without doctor’s opinion…this could turn out very bad."

176171827,Some mental health clinic have policies about meds. One I’m in now is you have to see the therapist 3-4 times before your first med clinic appointment. It takes forever to get in even for just an evaluation. I waited two months last time I transferred back to get an evaluation. I wish you good luck
176171828,No. _PHONE_NO_

174386111,"I’m not sure, but I was accepted in senior housing when I was 40 or so years old. I had been declared “disabled”. I think you have to be officially dx’_NAME_ as disabled. I didn’t last long in that place. I was off my med’s, and I saw a policeman near the entrance as I walked by, and I thought he had come for me. I was out on the balcony of my ninth floor apartment, with my hands on top of my head with the fingers laced, pacing back and forth and bellowing, “Help! I want to talk to an attorney.” I did that for about thirty minutes. Needless to say, it got a lot of attention from the police. It took them a while to get me off that balcony. They were out in the hallway, and I’d try to sneak in and lock my door. Then they would run up and try to catch me, but I would run back onto the balcony, and they would go back out to the hallway, and I would try to sneak in and lock my front door. That went on for about 20 - 30 minutes before they finally caught me. They took me to the mental h
ospital, and I was no longer welcome at that building."

176171835,"Remember that 1g of fat = 9 calories. Word diet within itself really means nothing if you aren’t creating actual deficit, so that your body can finally tap in those fat reserves. You need to create calorie deficit each and every single day so that you can start losing body fat progressively. Even in scenario where person eats nothing, zero caloroes for 7 days, she/he would still lose very little. Maybe 2lbs fat per week. But that’s having zero food for 7 days. Maybe first week person would lose more due initial water bloat. Cronometer app is a fine choice to start logging in each and every food item you ingest, so that you can have a broader picture. And start making an adjustments from there. Eating calorie surplus = weight gained Eating calorie deficit = weight lost"

176171838,"The APA just released an official statement after Mr. _PERSON_ blamed mental illness for the shooting.

176171851,Somehow you need to reach out so you have a few people in your life for fun times where you go out together but aren’t totally focused on your problems. Maybe try meetup? It’s an app for people to meet other people with common interests. It has platonic groups that you can join and have fun with. It might take your mind off your separation anxiety and onto fun you can have.
176171852,I don’t know… I’m new to seeking treatment on purpose. The latuda wasn’t getting rid of some of the stronger voices I really needed help with so he prescribed the haldol to take more or less as needed. I’ll ask him next time I go in.

I see myself as being on the same level, mostly normal usually -that is the real delusion."

176171856,"Yeah, maybe I was at the final stage of the sz… for a time… I didnt even know before, that there are stages in this… one pdoc told it to me… For my meds, I think that I need them yeap . But one doc was wondering why not any ap didnt make me happier… I tried them all for the last ten years, 12 aps here on the market , I’ve tried 11 of them, really… the zyprexa seem to be my med though. With its side effects maybe… Does the psychopathy appears in the final stages? They told me, I am a severe case also yeap… but I got used to be alone in my loneliness… it turned to be inhuman too when I think it now… Terrible family tragedy for me, I still need lots of support and strength to continue my fight but yeap… it was hard, very hard… Illness till a life time, isn’t it? But maybe I’ll be happier one day for the first time in my life, yeap Hard thing all this… my thoughts go to all of you who knew so much pain too…"
176171857,I’m still dealing with delusions but they are becoming more manageable as my AP was just doubled. Now just dealing with feeling tired and groggy during the day.
176171858,"Insight, it’s very important, cultivation of that is immensely helpful. And agreed. When I hallucinate, but can tell it’s not real, when I have insight, it isn’t a huge issue. When I lose insight and the delusions that the hallucinations are real start to confuse me, make me fearful, turn me against the world, that’s when it’s dangerous. Do you have a crisis plan Incase that happens?"
176171859,I got a new vape device in the mail the other day but I didn’t realize it didn’t come with batteries. So I ordered batteries for it and they are on their way. It looks awesome and seems like it will hit really nicely.

176171865,"I don’t say this anymore, think it sounds too dramatic, but this was an expression of mine from back in the day: ""If a person could look inside my head, what they would see would give them nightmares."" I’d say it’s pretty accurate for me, with all the trauma I was put through as a child, and as an adult. Hell, my psychotic breaks were traumatic experiences for me. PTSD is another diagnosis of mine, stemming from childhood abuse (sexual, physical, psychological, verbal). Anyway, do you agree with my statement, that if someone could look in your head what they would see would give them nightmares? yes no 0 voters Idk if this is more of a PTSD thing or a schizo thing."

Not for lack of ambition or anything, it’s like there are too many thoughts, and I can’t just bear down and hammer out something coherent. I’m pretty sure it’s a physiological thing though. I read that brain inflammation is tied to negative symptoms, and the suffering schizophrenic just can’t argue away / mentally outwit the physiological process. That’s part of what makes schizophrenia so frustrating, this idea that you can just out-think it, when it appears to be a simple physiological issue, some tissue damage causing chronic brain inflammation. Emotional stress does worsen the inflammation though, so that part is somewhat psychological."

I picked the stitch out i will use a milder tape such as masking tape to hold the two sides together which will come off easy and not leave residue. Tacking down to seat does not leave residue it comes off clean staying to seat What is used here is plush blanket material there is heavier types such mink blanket etc, but I favor plush because my brain says it is good.

176171878,"It all started when I posted on husband’s family whatsapp group that he’s in hospital and so prayers appreciated. Then his eldest sister phoned me and I made mistake of telling her that I’m thinking of leaving him. Stupid me! I unleashed a Pandora’s box… His sister said she wants to send me a gift so that I can relax and have strength to stay with her brother. I said no its not necessary but she insisted. So I was half forced to give her a list of what I wanted (including the _NAME_ book I so badly wanted). So I told my mom and she was very angry at his sister and said how dare she bribe me with her gifts and that I mustn’t accept it. But cancel it. So I told hubby sister to cancel it but she said she can’t, and called me “indecisive”. I said there’s no need to hurt my feelings but she said she works so hard so is “understandably annoyed” So the gift came today and I opened it and it was the coffee and biscuits I ordered and book will only come in two weeks. Then saw message 
from my mom saying do NOT open it. Oh God! But I told her I didn’t eat of the food etc yet. She told me to give it back to hubby’s mom saying I won’t accept bribes. So she phoned my husband’s mother and somehow she must have blabbed it out to her daughter my husband’s sister and his sister sent me a flood of these unspeakably rude messages saying I’m spreading rumours and that im twisted and have sick mind and need help and am a silly woman and she called me a “sickbird” (a what?..) lol it was actually hilarious in its profanity. I told my mom as she had said I must relay if they say anything. Waiting for her reply. God, she’s going to blow her top! She’s already so angry that my husband’s sister bribing me. My husband’s sister claimed later that it’s an appreciation gift but it was more a bribe as she first intended to give me gift to try to change my mind about leaving hubby. I’m getting paranoid not only about hubby but about his family as well. God I can’t wait to leave his f

176171879,I’m really happy for you
176171880,it’s always possible but hard for us to say if it is or isn’t… you really need to talk to your pdoc about it. But i think it’s more likely that you got both than that it’s one of them…

174386129,"Yeah! I’m glad you’re thinking about it. You should try Saphris, it’s great. Works really well for my sza bipolar type. It’s kind of mild as aps go, you might like that, I think it has less side effects too."

176171902,Hello and welcome
176171903,I suggest to play some sport where you get to challenge others or workout a schedule with some one you know. For me workout is a repeating task I feel I m being punished.
176171904,It seems so obvious now that it’s been researched. I’m surprised nobody thought of it before.

176171910,"Thanks everyone. I’m doing much better today, I think that the culprit was food related. I bought some almond butter for the first time ever and had some last night, then the swallowing issues occurred. Going to keep an eye on things."
176171911,"It’s been so long…since diagnosed or young I dislike seeing people,I just can’t see eye to eye and turn negative whenever I have to engage in a conversation.Its not able to solve,at least in the near future as I tried therapy,taking more medicine…it’s just there as always"
176171912,"Sounds like this person has some legit problems but potentially is exaggerating some (probably not all) of her problems. Also she could be naive and doesn’t understand the difference from dissociation and forgetfulness (for example). I would not hold it against them or be hostile to them. Point out what they are doing and urge them to self reflect and honestly assess what is a problem and what is considered normal. Then suggest they see some sort of professional help, maybe with therapy as from what i hear most are no bs types and will tell her bluntly some hard truths. I think a lot of schizophrenics (or depressed people, people w minor mental health problems and such) have at one point or another been guilty of seeking sympathy through exaggeration. People i know with depression do this a lot in my experience. Ive been told on multiple occasions by different individuals that sz and depression are on the same level. People naturally want attention that is safe, sounds like this woman is addicted 
to it."
176171913,I’m still waiting for the tablet that you take once and it lasts for ten years.
176171914,Great work fade _PERSON_!!! keep going!
176171915,Woke up late but well rested. Took a cold shower cleaned up and put on some nice clothes and was smelling good. Today is my day off. Went to the mall with my mom and sister. Ate some good food and I paid for everyone. Shopped around and I bought 3 - T.shirts for roughly $30. Ate some ice cream and later drank some coffee which I paid for. Shopped around some more. Went home. Relaxed and listened to an audiobook. Read for a little bit. Went to sleep.
176171916,I have a vitamin D deficiency as well. I take vitamin D supplements daily.
176171917,"Nope, very possible. You’re just finding excuses not to."
176171918,because I can…
176171919,"I kind of agree to some extent. I’ve seen friends who will literally be vaping constantly while they are doing other things (like driving or gaming etc). Where as a cigarette wouldn’t go on for undefined periods of time. That said I don’t feel like they are an apples to apples comparison. Even if volume of one is much higher than the other, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the smaller volume is better for you. But I do think you’re right that people should be aware of how much they’re vaping because it’s very easy to do it passively."
176171920,Good stuff! Congratulations!

176171925,It’s like saying about professors of literature that they can’t get rid of their academic point of view. Most great authors and poets were not professors. Talent is irrelevant to years of study. Study makes you a critic. Not an artist

I had a telemedicine appointment with my primary care physician on Tuesday to discuss my increased anxiety and stress levels as well as the issues with insomnia and the flare up in in my irritable bowel syndrome. I also had a telephone appointment with an on call psychologist (she had a last minute cancellation and was able to squeeze me in yesterday). Unfortunately, my health insurance is chronically short of mental health service providers so it’s difficult to get good regular mental health care.

I left a message on her answering machine and told her that I’ve decided to move on and see a different therapist that specializes in CBT. A few minutes later she called me back and said goodbye. I thanked her for her services all these years. I must admit, she was very professional about the whole thing. Now it’s time to move on. My search for a new therapist begins. But I may take a break first."
176171950,Tell your husband that we’re not exactly catches. Its annoying to see you being pressured to alienate a support group for this “potential” problem. It shows a lack of trust. I think your husband just needs to rethink why he’s worried. We’re just people online. We aren’t doing anything other then trying to be supportive.
176171951,I showered this morning
176171952,"Sounds about the same rate I gained weight as well. In 4-5 years I’ve gained about 30 pounds. I’m down 13 pounds in two+ months with strict calorie counting and exercising. Like I said before the only thing I really hate about the med is how much it makes me sleep. But all APs have side effects, I’m just glad to be functional and able to attend college and live a relatively normal life."

176171958,"When I did my keto diet, I had dramatic weight loss the first week too. I think it has to do with glycogen levels (whatever that is) and then once off the diet I put on the weight again a couple of kg less. Now 5 months later I am back to original weight. I lost a kg last week back on the 1500-1600 calorie diet, plus as I can’t do cardio I am using my 5kg dumbells more. I don’t have problems having a restrictive diet so noom wouldn’t benefit me much I believe. I just have to face that if I eat anything over 1600 calories I gain weight. Sucks, but being on aps is a diet for life anyway."

It’s like a formula or script they’re reading from (more like a computer program, since the main voice is fairly artificial and tireless.) The only time I am not so annoyed is when they call me by my actual, legal name. It’s not corrupting me or anything, just annoying the ???? out of me.

176172026,"The first story I ran passed them which is absolutely true and they agreed is true is this one. A long time ago I went to a night club and didn’t get any women (I would say because a lot of things are fake). After the club finished everyone went on the street outside. In revenge I had a conversation through which I encouraged the local women to leave their boyfriends and join the black guys. The women I worked with agreed what was said and the theme from a woman’s point of view. It took three goes but all of the local women (a very large crowd) in the end left the men they were with and went home with the black men. The thing that is significant about this true story is that once established, it is pretty obvious that all of the average guys who lost their girlfriends that night would definitely say I am mentally ill to protect their inadequate relationships. If they were on here they would all be shouting for me to go to ER and say I am in crisis. In fact I have just got a higher ability with 
women and have higher intelligence than average. This is what’s causing (usually) men to say I am mentally ill."

Am taking no cold meds just in case. Have some Tylenol but only if things get real bad. Have menthol rubs I am inhaling in case it is sinusitis.

To avoid that potential side effect, drug developers may have to refine the chemistry of fenofibrate or discover new agents that activate PPAR?. “To test the therapeutic strategy in people, we need more drugs that penetrate the brain for clinical trials,” _PERSON_ says.

176172099,"I got in some situations in high school where I just didn’t belong. It was awkward as hell. One time in particular. My downstairs neighbor was friendly. Too friendly I later learned. But for a awhile he was a family friend. And he happened to be friendly with this family of 4 brothers who went to my school. The oldest brother was in 11th grade and he was starting quarterback for the varsity football team. Which meant he was one of the most popular guys in high school. He was good looking too. My neighbor used to visit his house and he took me over there one time. I was like a fish out of water. I had no business being over there. It was just crazy. The whole family was good looking and popular and I don’t want to put myself down but I wasn’t popular or good looking. And here we all are in their living room and I wasn’t talking to anyone or being friendly. I was just in over my head. I felt crazy as hell and nobody probably liked me or thought much of me. The other time that sticks out in my 
memory was when my friend took me to a basketball game at school on a Friday night with his friends. His friends were all these really cool, good looking people with girlfriends and everybody knew them and once again It was in over my head. I was squished in the back seat with a couple of them.

176172123,"It’s more complicated to explain it as I see it. For the most part, people’s association with ‘ego’ and ‘being selfish’ as ‘bad’ causes people to assume a false identity - usually associated to being ‘good’. Usually those associations are projected onto other people so as to avoid owning them within ourselves. i.e. “Look how egotistical that person is.” “Look how proud that person is. I can’t understand that.”. Qualities like pride and self-esteem are actually good, but nearly worldwide they are perceived as ‘bad’ and as something that causes ‘narcissism’. Narcissism itself is also associated in a way that pride and positive qualities are considered ‘bad’ rather than healthy. After all, feeling good about yourself is actually healthy and the reverse isn’t. It actually leads to self-deprecating. And who would tell a flower that it’s wrong for being anything other than what it is? That makes no sense. But back to the original point: most people are concer
ned with ‘goodness’ (which is not founded in a genuine place) in a way that is actually what our ‘ego’ is concerned with. Our ego is concerned with appearing ‘good’ and by finding people that are ‘bad’ we can be ‘seen’ as ‘good’ while the other is deemed ‘bad’. This kind of thing is what I’m talking about which is detrimental and its spread without consideration. But because most people think ‘ego’ means something other than a facade or a sort of false identity that we grow accustomed to? They believe the response is to avoid being ‘selfish’ (and self-interest) and do what others have deemed ‘good’ which is actually just a social convention that people follow. And this is to avoid the consequence of facing rejection from a social group. I mean, do you think anyone authentically and genuinely comes into this world and says, “I can’t wait to work at Wal-_NAME_ to check receipts!”. No. Kind of hard to relay how that relates to the subject… I can see that. But in 
general I swear I struggle falling into the negative side of things because of a common misunderstanding of meanings that are rarely questioned with honesty. It causes you to doubt yourself and it can be painful. Which… is why most people prefer to keep their present perception of reality as fixed as possible since opening the door to questioning means opening the door to self-doubt - and that can be painful and confusing. Well generally that’s because most people perceive people as ‘other’ and therefore as a threat. They do this - because as I’m trying to explain - most are operating from ‘ego’. People may ‘think’ they are ‘good’ because of some actions they do, but they rarely ever realize that it isn’t genuine. It doesn’t come from a space of love or compassion. It’s more or less programmed into people and is therefore not genuine. I’m just frustrated because I get treated like a criminal at times and I want to argue its because how ungodly stupid people have become. How littl
e people understand has a lot to do with the structure that we’re indoctrinated into. It creates so much unnecessary pain and isolation. It wouldn’t have to be this way if people were just more honest about themselves and what they really want. Most don’t realize it can all change according to what we want. But to do that means breaking away from old programmed beliefs."

176172129,"I will never forget the time when I was in the hospital on my own in a waiting room when everything turned black. All I could see was what looked like a brightly lit TV screen. On that screen, was a news broadcast. When I got home, I watched the news, and bingo, I saw the exact same thing, the exact same thing hours later. So I had seen a news broadcast that had not even happened yet."

176172133,"I’m not sure if it’s still a thing, but my ex husband was declared legally insane in the state of _NAME_ because he had done lsd. That alone made him legally insane. And he hadn’t done anything wrong while on lsd. It was enough that at any point in time in his life he had done it."
176172134,"If it’s a sunny day and I have somewhere to be I’m happy. If it’s lousy and I’m stuck inside just surfing the internet and looking at screens all day I become depressed… at least if it goes on for several days. I can’t get a car until I move. After that I’ll make plans like every other day and post about them here, like I try to do when I’m visiting."

176172137,Also I would love to be working in the morning or day at a tea shop or clothing store.

Know it isn’t true and that people here and in your life care about you."

176172147,"That’s great news. You’re lucky. At least you don’t have that trauma on top of all the other traumas. I’m doing a workbook for trauma, and then discussing it with my therapist. Are you doing a workbook or just talk therapy?"
176172148,"Stay and play. Guidelines are good for a community with psychotics. You just have to appreciate that some topics aren’t good for others who may not be doing as well as you. In fact, some topics, can be quite triggering in themselves."
176172149,I think it’s a good idea to get more books on a topic since they after all are not the same. Authors have different ideas on how to approach things if that is what you are indirectly asking.
176172150,ok we won’t discuss it here
176172151,I think psychosis is a disease and a spiritual thing. I think everything is a spiritual thing. Spiritual just means meaningful to me so yea everything is meaningful.

176172154,"I think if a person with sz takes an autism test, it will tell them to get tested."
176172155,"I don’t accept that. I will get better in some ways. In other ways I’ll get worse. I feel like giving up sometimes when things get frustrating but I always feel good again eventually though it may take a good nights sleep and a few hours in the morning for the eventual good things to happen. I’m 59 and still teachable and not dead yet and I’m having an OK day and that’s good enough for me. I had my little adventures today met some both friendly and unfriendly people and later I’ll go home and have a good dinner. Things don’t always go my way and life ain’t easy but that’s the breaks. I reluctantly accept that too. If I have a heary attack tomorrow and I’m on my deathbed at least I’ll know I dated a few women who were way out of my leaugue, I scared some soldiers, I saw and did some cool things as an addict (I’m not endorsing drug use, it almost killed me) that many people have not seen or done, I flew across the country, watched a girl in shorts roller skating in the hospita
l, been chained to a bed in a mental institution, (which may be bad, but it’s a helluva life experience) and had lots of laughs and good times despite having one of the top ten disabling diseases in the world.And that counts for something. My wish for you _AT_MENTION_, would be that you keep going and you learn more and get better. I can’t give you those things except to say that as I aged I got better and I could have given up easily but I climbed some mountains and got to the top despite being laughed at or treated condescendingly by idiots who want me to give up. I can’t advise you perfectly on this topic but things tend to get better right after things look bleakest. I wish you luck in your life and I hope you catch a glimpse of some hope in your life. Now, back to my diet soda and I have to get back to the neighbors from hell."
176172156,I have complexes on my complexes
176172157,"In my early hospitalizations, my parents found the hospitals and got me in there. I didn’t object or put up a fuss or fight. My first hospitalizations were in 1980-1982. I was 19 and in no condition to take care of myself or function. I was depending on my parents and I co-operated fully. While I was in the hospital or the group home they were working behind the scenes talking to doctors and trying to get me in the best places. Back in the eighties the psychiatrists tried to get people into hospitals as much as they could. Now, I’ve heard a million times how hard it is to get into those places. Personally, while I was inside I wanted to do anything to get out! I got out of an 8 month stay in a hospital in 1982 and in the ensuing years I got pretty stable. I stayed out until a nasty relapse in the late eighties probably partially due to a drug addiction. I was hospitalized several times. My psychiatrist at the time usually checked me in. The hospital was right near his office and we walked over 
together and he talked to the staff and helped me fill out paperwork. Back then, there was an office with a room where if you were in crisis you talked to a couple nurses and they got you inside the room and the staff talked to you and evaluated you to see if you needed to go in the hospital. Basically, it was a screening room. People in there were really sick but the screening process was really slow and the room wasn’t meant to put people up for more than a day or a day and a half. So if they didn’t get to you soon, you could end up spending the night. There were no beds though so we had to sleep on tiny, uncomfortable couches made of fake leather. The last time I was in there was 1990. Lol, I remember one of my last stays in there. There was this 30 year old Mexican chick in there. She had a hard, tough look but she looked great in a tight pair of jeans. I couldn’t stop looking at her. I kept checking her out. I was 29 I think. I thought I was being sneaky and I didn’t think she noticed until all o
f a sudden she turned to me and said, “If you don’t stop looking at me I’m going to punch you in your fat nose”. I was totally embarrassed (and a little scared, lol). It’s funny now but at the time, I wasn’t laughing."
176172158,"Hello there. _PERSON_ I went away to a nice farm about 3 hours from cape town for a nice weekend. These 4 brothers i go far back with so it was good seeing all of them. One of the brothers is transgender, Its the first time ive seen him in about 2 years and he is now a woman. We spoke alot about it and I really enjoyed her company. She was always negative when he was a man and now that hes turning woman, shes so much happier. We spoke for ages about _USER_ID_ and stuff like that and learnt alot about being transgender, and I really learned so much. Anyways I think its so cool that she is happy and found her path in life. I actually felt so proud when she was talking to me about how hectic the _USER_ID_ for transgender is, and what people have called her etc… and overcome it !! Anyways I had a great time with all of them. Stay safe"

Luckily my mom fought it and I was able to graduate on time. Almost all of them were mental health days, even though I feigned physical illness. It makes me sad to remember how it felt like no one was willing to help me. I’m glad my mom understood in the end. I really loved learning, still do, just not in that environment."

176172179,Hey it is so good to hear from you again!
176172180,I’ll say that attitude is important too. People can be prone to going down negative thought spirals that stress their body out. Me included. I enter critical spirals that make my head literally hurt. I’m going to try self hypnosis to break out of that pattern. Gonna buy and try this: http://www.selfhypnosis.com/downloads/emotional-calm/
176172181,I know what you mean. It’s not your fault. You’re not a bad person. You didn’t put those thoughts there. It’s just the sz talking. I have to remind myself all the time. It’s ok.

176172190,It’s good to have some space and both think about what you guys want to do with the relationship. Maybe when you are ready to talk to each other. Sorry to hear you’re going through difficult times. I been through separations with my partner of 20 years. Once we were separated for nearly a year but we got back together and are happy now.
176172191,"As far as I understand it integration sort of makes all the identities mix to together as a sort of melting pot. But I tend to avoid looking into it cause it scares us. And as far as thinking about them more than me I wouldnt say that. I care about them like family. They are important to me and I love them. They are people too which is something many fail to realize. Their happiness is my happiness, their health is my health, their struggles are my struggles. They protect me they care for me they help me through so much. That is why my belief is so strong. I cant imagine life without them. Without them I truly believe I would be unable to cope with things and probably die. I am a being with DID I do not dwell on the past or the what ifs. To ask if I wish I never had it is a question with a lot of weight. I do not wish to answer."

176172193,"If you really want to “teach your girlfriend not to cheat” you are too dense to find a nice girl. And girls who look faithful are usually a bag of worms. But, of course, people often get what’s coming to them in my experience. You need to establish trust, listen to what she’s saying and not just what you want to hear, don’t fall in love. Relationships are like a battle, at least that’s how I see it as a girl… You need to learn how to dance and psychologically analyze your partner. falling in love right away is suicide. I learned that from western culture and I’m not even white. How do you even expect to get a nice white girl with an attitude like that? Look for traits that aren’t superficial in a girl. Like where she grew up, what the secret passwords are, and definitely if you can meet the expectations of her mother and father."

176172195,I hated high school. I hung out with people who called me ugly every day. They also called me dumb and a wh ore. At a few occasions they physically abused me even. If I relived that time I would rather be alone than hang out with those people who treated me so badly. It’s better to be alone or I might have found nicer people to be around. I later had voices call me ugly 24/7 and I wonder now if it came from the bullying back then. I didn’t fit in with any group. My friends in onsala hung out with the bullies and now I think they were bullies too for hanging out with them and allowing them to treat me that way and they disrespected me.everyone did. I wagged but by myself. Hated those years n was really depressed and no one understood me and I would get ridiculed if I tried telling anyone I was suffering they would mock me.my step dad and girlfriends specially did . I was also raped many times and sometimes I had bad disrespectful sex when I was drunk and other times it was full on rape.

176172201,I had this microchip delusion long time ago. Then I had voices telling that there is X in my forehead and that I was with Satan and I should be in Moscow. They were just delusions and voices.
176172202,Worry about things is common. Your not anyone different from what you describe. Be cool. Listen and learn and ask them about these things. Why do you need to be on injections? Why do they consider me a risk? I think questions like this will help you. Here’s the thing. You only have things to gain from playing the game so to speak in your future. It will help you normalize in the health system. It will help you not seem a threat to those in the system. If you have to go in with a list of questions like you do here. Keep them on point and ask those questions about treatment you ask here…we are just internet people. You need to ask this to your medical professionals and you have an outlet to do that… Use it.

174386217,I’ve had 20 years to learn how to hide my illness. For all outward appearances no one would guess I have schizophrenia. I had to learn how to hide my illness when I was working. I met a guy that had a sister with schizophrenia. I knew him for 6 months before I told him I had it. He was blown away and asked how did I appear so normal? I haven’t had a relapse in 20 years. I take my medication every day. When I was working I had to learn how to hide it. Put me in a room with 5 people and play guess the schizophrenic. It took me years for me get better. I dress well I take care of myself I just don’t talk about what’s going on in my head.
176172210,Yes thanks _AT_MENTION_ I have a feeling that more meds is not the answer.

It kind of seems like you don’t trust any of them and that you may be reading something into their behavior that may not be there. Wasn’t that you about a year ago who complained about your therapist rubbing your back? It seems like there were a few other incidents too. Maybe I’m wrong."
176172223,For sure. The doctors thought I had _NAME_s disease…ugh. They finally realized it was uncontrolled arthritis. It took so long to figure out. I was like stop telling me what I don’t have and tell me what I do so we can fix it. Sometimes the medical team is too much. I’m so glad you don’t have dimentia.

176172225,The reason for why I want to know is because I am on Amisulpride on a low dose and when you are on a low dose Amisulpride it actually help most with the negative symptoms. I have perceptual problems (some visuel distortions). And before I talk to my Pdoc I want to know if it is a positive symptom cause if it is I want to be upped in dose so it can help on these problems too.
176172226,I thought many times I faked sza too. Must probably be the lack of insight that comes with the illness.

174386222,"None that I or my parents know. Its still genetic though, its just that sz genes weren’t active in other family members. I learned in university that genes can be programmed to be on and off. Sadly scientists don’t know most of sz genes so no treatment."

Don’t worry though, because cachexia isn’t painful as far as I’m aware. It just happens, and then it’s over. I’m so sorry this is happening to you and your family, _AT_MENTION_ .

176172236,"I don’t think therapy would make OCD disappear completely. You can work on trying not to act like you have OCD, but afterall you’ll still have it as there’s a chemical issue. It’s like people with _PERSON_’s syndrome. You can learn how to hide it, but in the end you’re still going to deal with this issue. My opinion has always been that a patient should at first treat its OCD with drugs, meanwhile going to a therapy to acknowledge that its compulsive disorder is pointless and you shouldn’t do that. When you finally get rid of OCD, then you stop taking antidepressants and it should be fine after that. Benzo helps just a little with OCD, it isn’t a remedium. There are many antidepressant out there that you probably have never used. Psychiatry is like a lottery, sometimes you have to change it a couple of times in order to find this one drug that suits you well and helps you with your OCD."

174386223,"Thanks everyone for the feedback. I have never had someone with schizophrenia to talk to before, so it’s hard to know what is normal, whatever that might be _PERSON_"
174386209,"For me I know for sure antipsychotics cause me negative symptoms. My diagnosis is bipolar (which my psychiatrist is questioning because of this). Yes I have been psychotic, mostly just delusions but they are definitely there. I fight taking antipsychotics because they cause negative symptoms, every one that I have tried and I have tried a lot of them. It is true that some people get negs some of the time but it isn’t prominent. I have a few times off meds but they were tolerable, I mostly just avoided people. On APs I get negs. They call it NIDS when it happens from meds. My psychiatrist claims I shouldn’t get negs as bad from APs and that is more of a sign of schizophrenia (predominately dopamine imbalance). So I am fighting the diagnosis only to avoid APs if I can and see if what he says is actually true or if he is trying to get me on a new AP for the kickback. I doubt I have schizophrenia, I was only on an antipsychotic for 10 weeks from November through January and before that it was years 
and nothing bad happened. It does bother me when I hear other people with bipolar say “yeah I stopped taking that antipsychotic, I gained too much weight”. Are you kidding me? That’s the only bad side effect you got? No akathisia or inability to enjoy anything or not being able to talk or finish brushing your teeth? You’re able to get out of bed? Actually do something productive? Really?"
176172250,It could be natural phenomenon that I attribute to people. Whatever it is I want it to stop.

176172260,"I read about gray matter loss with Haldol, but I guess it reverses after you stop it? I hated Haldol. I’m super sensitive to meds and I like Vraylar a lot. I tried Geodon but didn’t see much use of it and it was hard to get on for some reason. Psychiatrists are too conservative in my opinion and pick and choose their favorite meds to give people. Not sure if they’re being paid and used to promote certain drugs or they just have their favorites that work. I had 1 CAT/CT scan that turned out normal. I had 2 MRIs that showed white matter marks or damage in my brain. Nothing about ventricles, gray matter, or anything including my hippocampus. I have a large white spot (3mm) on my right frontal lobe from ‘migraines’ and then a 9mm pineal cyst, which I have no clue how that crap happened or why. It’s rare and seen more commonly in women or when people die. I have a thought pattern that Dr. _PERSON_ said I have a small brain but a big heart. I guess it’s a delusion because I never met or tal

174386221,"Dont stop your meds especially since you were worse off meds. Talk about it with your Dr. From my experience there is no meds that made me happy. There is always downsides.

Personally I believe my negative symptoms are permanent brain damage. Everytime I tried fixing them like by changing meds I got worse."

I’ve heard plenty of people make such comments when I’ve been sitting on my rollator or using my wheelchair. It’s so disheartening.

174386233,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Reducing antipsychotic drugs in stable patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: a randomized controlled pilot trial. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience, Feb 2020 15 As the course of schizophrenic disorders is often chronic, treatment guidelines recommend continuous maintenance treatment to prevent relapses, but antipsychotic drugs can cause many side effects. It, therefore, seems reasonable to try to reduce doses in stable phases of the illness or even try to stop medication. We conducted a 26 weeks, randomized, rater blind, feasibility study to examine individualized antipsychotic dose reduction versus continuous maintenance treatment (Register Number: NCT02307396). We included chronic, adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who were treated with any antipsychotic drug except clozapine, who had not been hospitalized i
n the last 3 years and who were in symptomatic remission at baseline. The primary outcome was relapse of positive symptoms. Symptom severity, social functioning and side effects were also examined as secondary outcomes. 20 patients were randomized. Relapse rates in the two groups were not significantly different. No patient had to be hospitalized. One patient in the control group dropped out. The mean reduction of antipsychotic dose in the individualized dose-reduction group was 42%, however only one patient discontinued drug completely. There were no significant differences in efficacy or safety outcomes. This randomized trial provides evidence, that reduction of antipsychotic medication in chronic stable schizophrenic patients may be feasible. The results need to be confirmed in a larger trial with a longer follow-up period."
174386234,It seems that meds stopped working and we were increasing the doses constantly

176172313,I do a similar thing when overthinking things. I think it’s a left over from my central voice/thought that comments on what i do if that makes sense. I usually start to think negatively and I verbalize that. It’s usually swearing and derogatory on my person. ie I call myself names. Talking to oneself can be a symptom of sz. I’d say it’s in the ballpark if a little unusual.

Those with a 
main diagnosis of mood disorder had a significant increase in odds for an inpatient treatment order if there was an additional substance use disorder diagnosis (AOR = 3.81, p=0.006).Having an additional diagnosis of substance use disorder was associated with increased likelihood of being placed on an order.

176172363,"Yeah depression sucks. I’ve been there. I’ve been so depressed that I couldn’t even motivate myself to try to meditate. I just laid there on the couch. Sometimes there’s nothing you can do. If you can, try to write down a list of things that make you feel better than choose one and do it."
176172364,"I am by no means a doctor, but I have been through 7 AP switches Olanzapine was my very first, and I felt just like you do now Unfortunately you need to be prepared for disruption if you wish to switch to a less side effect harsh drug It will take a while, but for me, it was a price worth paying to feel as I do now"

176172376,"I wouldnt look up on meds overall, they are definetly going to help you have a better quality of life and you will have a better chance of a complete recovery, I would look up certain medications and see what side effects to expect and things like that. Basically your brain is getting overloaded with dopamine and the meds help regulate the receptors in your brain so you can think more clearly."

I think ill go back in it usual dose… Idk, I look like a very worried person… All this somatization… But it feels like its all in my head idk… Cause, no, I am always worried just about myself… At least, my mom says it so… But I am scared of how hypersensible am I.

176172472,"I wrote about my voices in a Discord channel, and some of my voices took offense that I didn’t introduce all of them. So here’s the text I wrote about my voices: In order of appearance: _NAME_: She’s negative and always comments on overyone, especially me. She mirrors my insecurities and things people have said to me in the past, and I’ve come to realise she does it to prepare me for when it happens again. She used to take over my body and control my actions, until I got on the right meds and was able to make compromises with her. She also sometimes gives me orders to do ”less pleasant” things. _PERSON_: He’s a priest. He talks a lot about how God will punish me or disapprove my actions and thoughts. I’ve come to learn through therapy that he represents the christian community I grew up in, and the shame they made me feel for not being one of them nor conforming to their standards. The Audience: a collection of 32 indistinguishable voices who yell _NAME_ or _PERSON_’s words and co
mmands at me to amplify the effect. _PERSON_ is their leader. Azelia: She is a good girl. She’s friendly and helpful, and calms me down when I’m upset. She’s my voice of reason and was born out of a desperate need for someone to tell me my feelings were okay and valid. Someone to be on my side when the world was against me. Blank: They’re anhedonic and pessimistic. They’re the voice of my depression, and often tries to take over when I’m down, though I rarely hear from them anymore as my depression is under control. What they typically say is ”nothing matters” or ”why even bother” _NAME_: _NAME_ is such a good guy. He’s care-free and cheerful, and just wants everyone to have a good time. He’s a ‘bro’ type of guy. He often encourages me to be myself. He went away for a good while, because I was in an environment that required me to supress those personality traits. _NAME_ told me he was dead, but I’m glad he’s not. I know I’ve kind of stolen his name, but he said it was alrigh
t and he was kind of honoured. _PERSON_: He’s kind of a bully. He’s solution-oriented, but his solutions are often extremes. ”Punch him in the face, that’ll shut him up” or ”jump out of the car, that way you won’t have to sit there and be uncomfortable”. He sometimes gives commands, but he’s accepted that I’m mostly not listening. … Except for when I play _PERSON_. _PERSON_ is a football fan and my game actually improves when he can be bothered to help out. _NAME_: He is my newest voice, I’ve only had him a few months. He worries about everything, and is very concerned for our well-being. He seems to be the only voice that recognises the body he’s in is mine, and that if it gets hurt, so does he. I think he reflects my anxiety and my tendency to over-worry about things. At the same time, he fills a need for someone to care for my well-being, and for that reason, _PERSON_ has taken a liking to him. Also, _PERSON_ sometimes talks about God loving me. The first friend I told about wanti
ng to change my legal name to _NAME_, offered to help me with the paperwork, and immediately, all the voices started yelling at me to do it. I even heard a “God loves you regardless” from Aamund And everytime someone calls me _NAME_, my voice _NAME_ squeals or laughs happily So there you go, there’s all of them. Feel free to post yours and/or say hello to mine!"

174386277,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov GPS mobility as a digital biomarker of negative symptoms in schizophrenia: a case control study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, PD _NAME_ and _PERSON_, NPJ digital medicine , 2019 Mobility is an important correlate of physical, cognitive, and mental health in chronic illness, and can be measured passively with mobile phone global positional satellite (GPS) sensors. To date, GPS data have been reported in a few studies of schizophrenia, yet it is unclear whether these data correlate with concurrent momentary reports of location, vary by people with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects, or associate with symptom clusters in schizophrenia. A total of 142 participants with schizophrenia (n?=?86) or healthy comparison subjects (n?=?56) completed 7 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports of location and behavior, and simultaneous GPS locations were tracked every five minutes. We found that GPS-derived indicators of average distance travel
led overall and distance from home, as well as percent of GPS samples at home were highly correlated with EMA reports of location at the day- and week-averaged level. GPS-based mobility indicators were lower in schizophrenia with medium to large effect sizes. Less GPS mobility was related to greater negative symptom severity, particularly diminished motivation, whereas greater GPS mobility was weakly associated with more community functioning. Neurocognition, depression, and positive symptoms were not associated with mobility indicators. Therefore, passive GPS sensing could provide a low-burden proxy measure of important outcomes in schizophrenia, including negative symptoms and possibly of functioning. As such, passive GPS sensing could be used for monitoring and timely interventions for negative symptoms in young persons at high risk for schizophrenia."

176172622,Occasionally and I’m not on anything any more besides a couple of anxiety meds on the occasion. I think alot of my paranoia is just self conscious insecurities that I’m beginning to work through with counseling at this point.

It gave me horrendous hallucinations… I was extremely turned on to the point that I was moving uncomfortably around in the bed and even touching myself at points, stamping my feet around in the room,… Whilst the neighbouring patient was wailing… All while the policemen were just sitting there not knowing wht to do with me. So I don’t ever want to go on anti anxiety meds. It cudda just have been my hallucination playing up but the effect was so immediate once they gave me the iv drop, and I’ve NEVer experienced something like that before or ever again."

176172642,Was listening to the radio and a program about health conditions was on. People phoned in and spoke loads about their various health conditions. It occurred to me I would never speak to someone so frankly about what I am going through. For instance I was at a dinner party in January and a woman there was telling the table all about her depression and anxiety. I would never have the guts to do that. Actually is not just guts maybe it is also my skewed view of dignity. Apart from with family I think I believe it more dignified to not talk about my sz. Not sure if this is healthy or not
174386321,"It’s ok because no one knows what your up to. You can watch whatever you want. Relax because your privacy is all yours man. You have schizophrenia and it makes you think other people know what your doing, when in fact, no one has a clue what your up to. I felt the same way with my schizophrenia. I thought people knew what I was up to when I was alone, but it’s really just the symptoms of schizophrenia. You should try a different medication, like Abilify. Abilify will stop them thoughts."

176172650,I’m not sure we have the same views on everything so I’d rather keep a lot of my opinions to myself is what I mean because I could see how opinions can be harmful on a message board for tons of diverse people to read. I try to avoid expressing opinions that may offend people these days. We may not agree on everything but we should try to agree to not say things that people take too personally/get offended by. Do people need to lighten up?? Sometimes. But I can’t change that so I’d rather just avoid opinionated stuff. Like the transgender stuff you were talking about. There’s people passionate about those rights I respect what they have to say and rather just listen than make judgements on something I don’t 100% understand. That’s all.

176172655,"Yeah I get that too. It’s hard for normal people to believe but I have to define it as something external to get by. Back when all this started I thought it was just me being a loner and creating them out of necessity to combat my loneliness but that meant that it was part of me. In the beginning it was ALL good. I never had a single negative voice from 2010 to 2016. Suddenly on April 20, 2016 my voices snapped and it went from Gods & Angels, the beauties of our universe, life, love, unicorns… you get the picture. It was ALL good stuff, never evil until April 20, 2016 when I spent the day speaking to a voice who had been in my life from January 2014 and still stops in to torment me to this day. His name was _NAME_ until April 20, 2016. I was writing… documenting because to me this information I had been fed was significant and needed to be shared with the world. So suddenly _NAME_ said as I was typing “You spelled that wrong.” I looked up and perused my document “No I’m not. Besides t
here’s spell check.” “Not a word.” He said “My name. It’s L.U.C. As in Lucifer” That’s the last thing I remember before coming to while stopped at a red light that had apparently turned green just before I came out of it because I looked up and all the traffic in front of me was a block down the street. I was thankfully the last car and I drove straight home only to black out at my front door and found myself out driving again. That day I fought hard and I remember being told I was being tested. That night I went to sleep and had a horrific dream that my husband of 20 years raped our daughter. She is the only girl out of my family’s 11 grandkids. I was raped, molested, physically abused… you know… just the worst humans in existence in charge of my destiny but whatever. I’m over it. I have LIVED my hell. My baby girl I thought I had protected from that fate until that night. I dreamt he raped her and I woke up from that dream stuck in that mindset that sometimes happens when you wake up 
from a very vivid dream and feel like you are still in it. I was still experiencing the feelings of disgust from the dream when I blacked out again. Looooooooooong story short I beat my husband bloody and he called the police. I spent months homeless before he found me and asked me to come home to my wonderful family. You’re not Lucifer _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ himself is the only thing in existence that can break a person’s mind like that. Now that I KNOW that angels and demons exist I am much more capable of fighting this off for my sake and my family’s. I do not believe that I am capable of that much hate and even though he lies I have love for Lucifer because his Father does. Lucifer is REALLY good at making people believe his lies. He gave me that dream specifically because nothing else would hurt me. He had been trying all day and towards the end of that VERY long day I was fighting hard and winning more than half of the time when he tried to take over. He KNEW his time with me would be limited to on
e more day at best and he had to act. My daughter experiencing my childhood horrors is my worst nightmare and for it to be her own father… my OWN mind probably played a big role in the blackout that bloodied my dear innocent husband. I don’t know if I really had a point but I am pretty positive that Lucifer is indeed in a human vessel BUT!! He is NOT going to out himself like schizophrenics are so apt to do. Lucifer wants to hide under our noses and get away with murder. He is not going to give up his anonymity. Here’s what I think. I think Lucifer left hell and all hell is literally breaking lose. Some of those demons aren’t actually bad. Look at it like this. Not all humans are good and they aren’t all bad. Lucifer, the fallen angel, is proof that not all angels are good. He took a handful with him but 2 Corinthians 11:14 says “For Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.” Meaning he will do just what he did to me and come as an angel of light and not something evil. Not all demons are 
bad either. Based on MY voices I am under the impression that any available celestial entity is currently in attendance of one of the most spectacular of celestial events and that is our very own apocalypse. Entities from the universe over are here in human vessels and that includes demons to witness the inevitable win of humanity over evil albeit this won’t happen completely in a single lifetime so don’t get too excited. What I personally think is that those of us who think we are some sort or demon may in fact be actual demons in human vessels. We dont know where we come from. It’s just a theory and says nothing more than there is good and bad in all aspects of our universe and we can’t help all the bad that comes our way but we dont have to be who we were created. We choose our destiny. Choose well _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_"

When I stopped it all of that irritability just went away."
176172663,Haldol sounds like a popular one too. Many members like it here. Maybe it is strong and weight neutral. What dose are you taking? Does it give you any side effect?
176172664,If you already eat enough protein you don’t even need whey but you can take the recommended daily dosage. From my memory its 0.8-1.2g of protein per kg of body weight. Too much of protein is bad for the liver.

Your bone marrow also does make stem cells, including neural stem cells I believe. It’s not clear that that was the mechanism - doctors say bone marrow doesn’t make a great deal of neural stem cells. It’s also possible that this guy’s symptoms were a result of his cancer and were misdiagnosed as SZ. I don’t know whether that is the case but it can’t be ruled out."

In the emergency a psychiatrist diagnosed me with psychosis NOS bcz I was sure that I was Jesus and that I saw Jesus for real.
176172678,"Oh ok cool. I should add that I if you are free of wants, that could be a good thing, I’m like that too, and have amassed some cushion/abundance but now I have questions.

We cater for all people here and it’s not cool to hide behind things like political correctness and say that is the issue. Just be civil and supportive. Your an adult. We all have opinions but being kind to others who are different isn’t a hard thing. _AT_MENTION_ . Stop digging yourself a hole. It’s not cool to think others who are different aren’t human. That is the problem and probably why your suspended a lot. Take onboard that perhaps it’s your ideas of humanity that is the problem rather than those who suffer the whiles of people who just have no idea.
176172682,I take perphenazine. It is a good drug for me!
174386334,"What would you choose? I would choose Invega since a lot of people need that injection since they get court ordered and it keeps them out of jail. Second, Haldol since that’s used in a lot of ER settings.

They are too intrusive, and why after a year, where ive been left to fend for myself. The previous one was a total snowflake anyway and was more interested in telling me about his dose of sertraline he was on. Im tempted to leave a crappy message on their answer-phone and tell them exactly what i think of them. But no im just gonna ignore the lot of them.

I’ve done it numerous times. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it was a failure but I always strive for best function on the pills I can get. It’s a marathon and not a sprint.

176172717,No unfortunately I don’t with mental health you’re pretty much stuck with the team you have. Psychical illness is different you can go any hospital. That’s why it’s so frustrating. Unless I move which seems like an option in the future.

176172722,"I believed CIA/Mi5 were trying to kill me due to what I learned about God. Since I believed that we are created by the words of God, I believed all my words were spirit creations, I believed the hair on the beard should not be cut because it represents a life of a child spirit. I believed that flesh was female in gender and I was a male spirit. I believed my body was spirits that agreed to be in my harem as wives. I believed each cell in my body was having a conscious life on other planets and my feet were various companies. I believed I was the Royal Mail spirit. The next delusion might be hard to understand. I believed that I could manipulate the life of my spirits by changing my orientation. I believed my life was the associations of a higher spirit and I was in the brain of that spirit."

176172754,I wouldn’t expect acceptance and I don’t see how it would help anything. I’ve gone years with little support and it hasn’t mattered. The support I’ve gotten here in the group home has had little to do with symptoms. More like when I confessed terrible abuses on the part of my mother starting from early childhood. And how I didn’t use to see value in myself because of it. Seems like bad advice to me. The illness is such a small part of knowing me. My hospitalizations tended to be because of an abusive M.I. mom and not crises. Like she would have me hospitalized and the ward doctor made up the excuse they were “Adjusting my meds.” Hardly. More like getting me sicker and sicker. They won’t happen again.

I first claimed disability benefits when I was 17 years old, back in 2003. Back then I was awarded DLA, high care, low mobility with a face to face interview and stayed on that until earlier this year. That was just for learning difficulties, I had my social worker sign the form them. In 16 years I have only had to attend one assessment for ESA, and I was only in there 10 minutes and the assessor said I needn’t of attended.

176172832,"About Giant Egg : I saw Russian film with Giant Egg encounter in it 20.6.2019 at morning , about 9 a.m. About 9:45 -10 a.m. that same day I saw two egg shells (probably on the ground), before 2 p.m. I saw many ants on the ground and in the encounter there was egg on the ground and six ants (or less)! I noticed certain 21 7 features in sums of numbers associated with triplet 7, 29, 139 . Sum of numbers in that triplet is 175 . Sum of numbers of sums of digits in 7, 29, 139 is 31 : 7+(2+9)+(1+3+9) = 7+11+13 = 31. Sum of numbers of sums of digits in 7, 11, 13 is 13 : 7+(1+1)+(1+3) = 7+2+4 = 13. We have received triplet: 175, 31, 13 . It consists of 7 digits and the sum of these digits is 21 . Arithmetic mean of sum of digits in triplet 175, 31, 13 is 7 : (1+7+5)+(3+1)+(1+3) = 13+4+4 = 21 ; 21:3 = 7 (3 is the number of numbers in 13, 4, 4). Triplets: 7, 47, 139 and 7, 83, 139 produce the same features, but with other three-digit numbers (which are additive primes, unlike 175). They are rather not as co
incident with 21.7 and 3, 6, 9 as 7, 29, 139. From first digits in triplets 7, 47, 139 numbers 21 and 7 can’t be formed (but product of 21 and 7, 147, can be formed), 21 and 7 together also can’t be formed from first digits of 7, 83, 139. Sum of digits other than first ones from numbers forming 7, 47, 139 is not 21 (it is 19 (7+3+9) and has not 7 as its arithmetic mean), that sum of digits in the case of 7, 83, 139 is 15 (3+3+9), it also has not 7 as its arithmetic mean (although it is formed by digits from 3, 6, 9 group (more precisely, 3 and 9 and 3 repeats oneself). Product of digits of 7, 47, 139 is not divisible by 3 6 9 (it is 5292, 5292:162 = 32,(6)) and the product of digits forming 7, 83, 139 (4536) is not 162 (3 6 9) times larger than product of digits in 7, 11, 13 (which is 21), but it is 216 times larger, 216 is not divisible by 162. “Giant egg” - 5, 23, 421 and 7, 29, 139 have the same sum of digits which do not repeat oneself in six numbers forming these triplets (7+2+1+3 = 13, 5+3+4+1 = 
13); 7, 47, 139 and 7, 83, 139 have other sums of non-repeating digits (4+1+3+9 = 17, 7+8+1+9 = 25)."

176172845,I got my flu shot this year and thought I was good to go. 2 days ago I got sick as hell. Today is day 3 and being a smoker with pneumonia royally sucks. I know it’s pneumonia because I got it once before about 20 years ago. I’m not going to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. I hate when they lecture me about smoking. I seriously hate hospitals. I’m not going to the hospital unless I’m on deaths door. I’m just going to tough it out. My lungs were full of fluid when I woke up. Coughing it up felt like a 300 pound man was kicking me in the chest. I’ve got a massive headache from gagging when coughing. I went to bed at 2 pm and slept until 3 am. All night I rolled around in cold sweats. Last time I had pneumonia it scarred my lungs. It showed up in some cat scans I had done. I don’t need doctors to lecture me on smoking. I’m fully aware of the consequences my mom has lung cancer.

Monthly injections are difficult because you’re stuck with them if you get bad side effects for a few months. I take one 234 dose and then a week later I get the 156.

This type of external power may perhaps provide for an outer illusions of security, but it does nothing for the inner security that we as human souls crave.

176172863,"My sleep schedule has been all messed up bc of my boyfriends house renovations. It gives me anxiety to be at his house w a bunch of strange men around working on it when he’s not there so I feel the need to leave before they arrive, and they come quite early so I just leave when my boyfriend does at 6 am. But the whole process stresses me out and my fast makes me hungry which keeps me up as well and a lot of nights I just end up not sleeping at all. I play videogames until I can finally eat then pass out until my boyfriend gets home from work. We play more videogames and then the cycle repeats itself. I’m not a big fan of the no sleep thing or the renovations. (House renovations have always stressed me out, the last time we had them done at my house I had a major depressive episode and was suicidal-I am handling this considerably better). But I like the relaxing during the day and doing what I want. Unfortunately that is about to come to an end as I have to start studying for the nclex and look

But then all elaborate “it looks real you “know” the table exists cause your looking at it and you see no reason to doubt that. Thats why its so hard to convince yourself that it isnt real.

176172950,I feel lonely today too. I would love to have friends I could meet or even just chat with. I have difficulties socialising . I like to think I have friends in spirit and even best friends in spirit but I have not felt them lately and I really miss them and am feeling down and depressed today. I am having breakfast with family tomorrow which is nice but even there I am not relaxed but it’s a bit awkward. I love them but they try to think they are superior somehow and I don’t agree.im not in the army and I don’t want to salute anyone ever and it doesn’t suit me.not who I am and what I believe in.i don’t want to be suppressed or bossed about in any way I don’t approve of. I feel so sad today. Before I was so happy because I was feeling loved ones in me saying I’m their best friend and I haven’t felt them lately and miss them. I miss cuddling. I want to find a vegan partner but it may to soon to do so before my mum n grandma have been here because I can’t date while they are visiting n 
they will stay a few months I think. Activities can help. Weekends are more difficult for me I think. I get so sad I just want to sleep and I’m in bed tired at 7.30 pm most nights including weekends. I can’t think of any advice because I need some myself perhaps. But activities can help and you can interact with people then which can be nice. I talk a little with those I volunteer with. I think they see me as “simple” and weird but they are patient and kind to me and we say a few sentences to each other when we volunteer together. I am socially awkward though and I think I may come across as strange and “simple”.
174386402,I’m on Prozac. I guess it helps but I still get sad about being schizophrenic. It’s just not a severe sadness while I was.

I drank 9.5 - 10.4 pH alkaline water for 2 months and reduced my chronic headache that I had for 4 years from an 8 / 10 to a 2-3 out of 10. I have to keep drinking it though, to stay out of the “oxidative impairement” state and allow my brain and body to heal. My issue with it is it might negatively affect digestion, so undigested proteins might pass through my intestinal wall and cause joint pain. My workaround is hydrogen gas inhalation (alkaline water’s beneficial effects are due to dissolved hydrogen)."

I could see how taking it with a therapist could be so helpful for ptsd. It’s seriously psychotherapy. Honestly if I took ketamine before meds it wouldn’t have been good. Its the only drug that mixes with meds at all. I think I’m balanced from it. Need to lay off it for a while because of the mania but yeah I feel pretty incredible

Of course I take the lowest dose you can take and only take one a day. My wife has a friend though who is always asking us for Xanax. That’s the only med I don’t have extra of because my wife and my sister in law will steal it from me. When I quit Geodon cold turkey a couple months ago I had a whole bunch of extra anxiety and my doctor gave me .5s of Klonopin. I only took one of them. I still have the whole bottle left. She said Klonopin lasted longer than Xanax. I still preferred the .25 mg of Xanax. It really helps my anxiety. The Klonopin was okay but I don’t have a use for it anymore.

I heard you had some troubles but your a new member for posting ramblings and things like against bad pharma. It’s not our behavior but yours. It would gladden my heart to see you as a positive and active member of our community. I’m not sure that is possible with your antagonism against everything that seems to help everyone else. It’s medications that lead to better outcomes for most. Just onboard the bus. Just don’t complain that the world is against you although I know your doing it hard.

Normally measures for compliance are so they can look after people who are a lot worse off than you, but they will still try to get you treated even if you are possibly ok to look after yourself. Being new to it, things like meds seem a bit scary, but they will have an overall improvement on your life if you take them. Maybe doing research on how the meds effect you and their side effects would help you feel more comfortable about taking them."

176173073,_AT_MENTION_ has never posted anything misogynistic or otherwise untowards that I’ve ever seen. I seriously doubt this is the case.
176173074,"I hope you have a good Sunday, everybody"
176173075,"Hi everyone. I have gained 13 kg since I started my meds 3 years ago. Can’t afford to go any higher. Has anyone experienced weight gain on Quetiapin? I’m taking reagila, quetiapin and lithium. Have a szad. I’m blaming quetiapin for that. But I’m afraid to quit because I might get delusional again…"
176173076,"I read somewhere that pms lowers dopamine in the brain, so if you have things that depend on that, like SZ, it can temporarily worsen the symptoms. I’m guessing sza comes with a mood component? I can understand your husband’s frustrations too. When people take their anger out on me, I always want to scream in their face that maybe they can’t help how they feel, but they should at least control how they react to those feelings. Of course I know it’s not that easy. But I bet that’s how he feels, like you somehow chose to let loose on him instead of finding alternate paths to get rid of your anger. Is he in the mood for a heart to heart?"
176173077,I made my profile private for many reasons but mainly bcz I received traumatizing pm from psychotic users that I won’t name. They had to do with my previous delusions and paranoias. I don’t want anything making me remember my psychotic days.
176173078,"Yes, like everyone is eyeing you. It is a weird sensation. I usually try to act as cool as I can and move as quickly as I can."

176173080,What you gon- what you gon-
176173081,actually i got 14 level by using memory technique. by grouping squares to bigger ones.
176173082,"It has been about 10 years since I was first diagnosed. The first 5 years were tough. I wasn’t exactly compliant with medication. I was first placed on injections. The first two years I was heavily medicated with an injection and some tablets that would dissolve under the tongue. After the first two years, I switched medication and was compliant. Still was on injections. After the first five years I grew more experienced in dealing with the illness. I wouldn’t say it got easier as much as I’d say I learned how to better live and cope with the illness. Somewhere around the 6th year I realized that the first few years I just wasn’t on medications I responded well to. After switching to a different medication, I began to feel more stability. By the 7th year I had switched to pills as opposed to injections. Feeling stable I tried life without medication (with the blessings of a psychiatrist) for around 18 months or so. I did fairly well and returned to college. Unfortunately, somewhere down the 
road I lost touch with reality again and ended up being hospitalized. Since then I’ve been back on a medication that has proven to work best for me. All in all, I’d say 8t has not worsened but being off meds for 18 months, I do feel like my brain was fried during psychosis. Slowly I’ve been recovering from that. My story isn’t necessarily inspiring or successful but at the very least I have tried to be a good person."

176173088,"Ive done cbt , dbt, act, for months and months it only helps force perpetual motion in getting things going and dealing with certain thoughts/actions, but as soon as you stop applying it then its easy to fall back into doing nothing. there really is no perfect treatment. med/ therapy whatever its a combination of it. i actually was able to get referred to a university for rTMS and its free on going for all the initial sessions and maintenance. im massively skeptical by nature of most things, and have my doubts about it, but i just did my 9 and 10th session and it definitely is starting to work. It doesnt last very long so far but honestly even a small break from hell is amazing progress for me"

A lot of what we recall depends on our current mood anyway, so there’s very little absolute truth to it all."

I stayed there 4 years through thick and thin, through psychosis and paranoia, through med induced fatigue and crack addiction. Through whatever they told me to do. I had never driven anything bigger than a car before but when they got a dump truck from somewhere and had me help load it and then they told me to drive it to the dump I got in by myself and dutifully drove it there. When they needed 10 huge bags of towels washed and dried, I loaded up the bosses car or my car and went to the packed laundromat on a Saturday morning and put 11 or 12 loads in the washers at once and then used 10 dryers at once while people complained about me. When the bosses had 10 bags of salt delivered in back that weighed a hundred pounds apiece for the isolation tank, I carried them from all the way in back of the building to the fr

(And wtf…I tried to Google to see for you if there were any studies in animals to see if prolactin caused homosexual behaviour. Google apparently saw my innocent search term as an interest in sex WITH animals. That was a part of the internet i did not want to know about. Sorry, not trying that again. )"

I guess thats when my problems all started and I want to regress. Or sometimes I want to just get out of my head and be somebody else. But, the pdoc says it’s just my sza diagnosis and not anything else like dementia or dissociation."

There is nothing wrong with having a kid and giving them up for adoption, either. It is an incredibly brave and selfless thing to do. Of course I feel that way as an adoptive parent, but it’s true. There are tons of folks like me out there, who want kids but can’t or won’t go the biological route."

174386464,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Features of schizophrenia following premorbid eating disorders. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research , Jun 21 2019 Eating disorders (_NAME_) and schizophrenia are frequently comorbid and schizophrenia shares genetic susceptibility with anorexia. Many factors associated with schizophrenia can disrupt eating, but _NAME_ can present years before schizophrenia. If premorbid _NAME_ distinguishes a particular subtype of schizophrenia, then phenotypic features may differ between schizophrenia cases with and without premorbid _NAME_.This secondary analysis used data from an inpatient schizophrenia research study that comprehensively assessed life course psychiatric disorders (DIGS interview), intelligence (WAIS), global assessments of function (GAF) and assessed symptoms during medication-free and fixed dose neuroleptic phases (PANSS).Premorbid _NAME_ was identified in 27 of the 288 schizophrenia cases (9.4%). This group h
ad more females than the group without premorbid _NAME_ (74.1% vs. 30%); premorbid _NAME_ was 5-fold more common in female than male cases (?2 (17.9, P < .0001). Only the premorbid _NAME_ group had gustatory hallucinations. They also demonstrated significantly more severe psychotic and disorganization symptoms during medication-free and fixed dose treatment phases, despite similar negative symptoms and GAF scores, as other cases. The premorbid _NAME_ group had significantly better cognition overall, but relatively lower nonverbal than verbal intelligence.Premorbid _NAME_ may define a specific subtype of schizophrenia that is common in females. Their more severe psychotic symptoms and better IQ, despite similarly impaired function and negative symptoms as other cases, suggests a distinct pathophysiology. Premorbid _NAME_ should be considered in evaluating risk states for schizophrenia, and as a relevant phenotype for treatment resistant schizophrenia."

Also at another point I felt like I was in a dimension of earth that didn’t feel so real. Another time I felt like God put me in hell. The first stage anyway. Another time I felt God put me in a kind of other weird dimension where I had to stay away from people or else cause serious harm to the planet.

174386466,"Agreement reached with FDA on submission of additional non-clinical information for NDA review of lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia Lumateperone PDUFA goal date extended three months to December 27, 2019 Conference call scheduled today at 8:30 am ET NEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ITCI ), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that it recently met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and reached agreement to submit additional non-clinical information in connection with the FDA’s ongoing review of the Company’s New Drug application (NDA) for lumateperone for the treatment of schizophrenia. The FDA has informed the Company that the planned submission of this additional information constitutes a major amendment to the NDA, resulting in a three-month extension of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date to December 27, 
2019 in order to provide time for a full review of the submission. “We are pleased with the productive dialogue we have had with the FDA,” said Dr. _NAME_, Chairman and CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies. “We intend to provide the FDA with the requested information in the coming weeks and we believe this information will be sufficient to address the FDA’s requests.” The Company has agreed with the FDA to provide additional information related to toxicology findings in previous animal studies with the objective to further substantiate the Company’s position that those findings are not relevant to humans due to species specific differences in the metabolism of lumateperone. The Company is performing a limited number of in-vitro analyses, including the analysis of animal and human plasma samples from previous studies to confirm that the metabolic pathway, and the metabolites formed, are different in animals and humans. The Company has commenced the requested analyses and expects to complete them shortly 
and provide the information to the FDA."

Furthermore the distressing areas of my life that are complex and so, sound a little strange I do not expand upon.

Thx for support ya’ll, it really is so hard when in the midst of it and hard to know when its happening but just warning/be careful with anti-depressants. I had no idea I was so sensitive to them. My pdoc said there’s no magic pill to make you happy, and that I shouldnt have asked for it if I was not depressed basically. I feel like it was my fault.

176173348,"I found it an interesting dream. The ferry was going to the island part of my city. At the beginning, I found my cousin there and he was talking to some girls. After he talked to me, he went away. I tried to talk to some people, but everybody didn’t stick with a conversation when I answered back. At least I was not feeling alone because I had myself. But the travel on the ferry was still peaceful and gave me good feelings. After I quit the ferry, I remember I left my t-shirt there and I run to get it back. After I take the t-shirt from the ferry and go back to land, I wake up. The internet is full of different meanings for this kind of dream. I have the feeling this represents my willing to change and to become a better person, even if relatives go away or if people don’t like me. There was a guy in this dream who talked to me and I can’t remember who he was, but he seemed to be very intelligent and strong. _USER_ID_: there was also a moment when I talked to a little boy on the ferry. He was 
saying how much he liked the peaceful life in a farm. I’m not sure if this boy represents myself (well, I think he represents myself)."

The people teaching CBT, coping skills, and behavioral activation at the outpatient program I attended were all Occupational Therapists.

174386525,"Yesterday I was working 10 hour shift and my mom texted me that she got a date at a restaurant and I thought that she will dine and go home alone or very least rent a hotel room. When I got home from work all stressed and managed to sit down for 10 mins (I was standing the whole 10 hour shift) and thought about thought about to have a ciggg outside and met my mom and him in the stairway. So my initial thought they gonna have a snack maybe some coffee and call it a night. So I had my smoke and prepped them coffee, gave them chocolate and said that I am going to the gym for a workout (P.S. I was really exhausted and the only reason I went to allow them to have fun in one hour) and before I packed my stuff the dude was talking some trivial stuff about politics and economics and my eye started twitching from stress and anxiety. So I hurried and left asap. When I got home I thought he left because my mom was alone in her room so I went to the bathroom and went into a naked stranger in the shower. So to 
distract myself I started doing some chores but that dude kept me stalling from bringing my dog for a walk talking about some trivial stuff. So after doing everything I needed for the flat I sat down in the kitchen and hands were not only shaking but it looked almost like an epileptic tremor and my eye was starting to close from twitching. So I had some cereal quickly and went for a smoke. I got back in the flat and my room is across my mom’s I had to walk past it and when I was walking it seemed my mom were jerking him off! ( even though my mom said they only were gonna sleep) so I felt really uncomfortable and while being in my room I started hearing moaning and put on some music. My chest was pounding and tight, painful as well, hands and fingers shaking and jerking, eye twitching, sweating and almost starting to have hallucinations. In my last attempt I put my headphones and played some music but I wanted to have rest but I couldn’t. In two hour they had sex for like 3 times (dude probably had viagra 
or smh) and they started talking loudly after sex and only in 3 am they calmed and was able to sleep. But wait! At 5 am they started talking again and having fun as well so they woke me and was as much or even more stressed! So I had shower and smoked then managed to get some sleep while they were in the kitchen. I am pissed at my mom, she no we that I have schizophrenia and I am really anxious and it can bring up my SZ and I also put a lot of effort at work and now I can’t even relax at home! She knows that I have _NAME_ from medication and told her not to have sex at home or at least when I am not at home. My mom made her look badly to have a guy at hers for a first date and have sex, she’s not in her 20s anymore! I know sex is healthy and recommended but I wasn’t that stressed when I started a new job in a foreign country. Today I slept whole day, i feel like paralyzed and unable to do anything, I just lay in bed at stare at a ceiling. What I ate whole day today was a bowl a cereal and that’s it al

This study aims to determine if SCZ patients are at increased risk of incident OSA.A total of 5092 newly diagnosed SCZ patients and 5092 non-SCZ controls matched by gender, age, and index year were included between 2000 and 2012 and followed to 2013. Participants newly diagnosed with OSA were defined as incidents. _PERSON_ regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the OSA incidence rate between the two groups studied.SCZ patients were at increased risk of OSA compared to non-SCZ controls after adjusting for gender, age, comorbidities, and duration of antipsychotic use (2.12 versus 1
.01 per 1000 person-years, HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.36-2.85). Also, this study confirmed the existence of some known risk factors for OSA, including male gender (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.14-2.37), obesity (HR 2.62, 95% CI 1.19-5.80), hypertension (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.06-2.47), hyperlipidemia (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.04-2.38), diabetes (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), and antipsychotic use (duration?"

You could scientifically prove it if you could have a medical team scan your eyes or brain or whatever else. It could be proven false, and would be.

176173431,"I read a diagram of four quadrants dealing in procrastination. It talks to what’s ‘important’ and/or what is ‘urgent’ So to me it says ‘quitting smoking’ is important yet it’s not urgent. Which is why it’s such a difficult thing to do. Another one is where you are, I would say your situation is urgent and important… but maybe that’s not what you’d want to hear!! Still not the most difficult quandrant though… it’s a hot seat through and through… still you can disagree etc And another aspect is some things are simply neither. And lastly, some things are urgent but not important, such as actually ‘doing the smoking’. Hope this makes sense; writing it out helped me remember it all, plus I’m trying to quit the nicotine at the moment!"

All APs I have tried have given me _NAME_, hoping my current medication I’m taking (Saphris) to not be a culprit.

174386542,"_PERSON_…I went off the deep one day and wrote about 2,500 words into my phone. Was probably experiencing hypergraphia. I did one better and ended up pasting it to my “about me” section on my public Facebook profile. This is something I _USER_ID_ often to pass time and have tried to be as honest about myself in it as possible. I suppose I’m looking for like-minded people to give me an opinion and I happen to find this forum quite interesting. Do I do anything with this? Do I keep writing? Might consider starting a reddit account but I don’t have the guts. This isn’t the first time I’ve cranked out a few pages on my notepad and I’m not even sure what kind of writing style this is. Anyways, here’s my “about me”. -“I’m writing this as a public service, you’re welcome. If a psychologist were to coin me from a mile away, she would probably say I’m a selfish, narcissistic, sociopath. She might be right. Growing up as a tiny white boy in the Pacific Northwest, I could also be 
a racist, homophobic, misogynistic bigot. I don’t have any gay or black friends, but I’ve treated every woman I know like complete ????, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I did them as well. Thankfully, I was raised by video games and Ritalin, so I grew up with a slightly open mind. Being spoiled didn’t help my issues, I received everything I wanted from my rich father who worked his life away. Now I’m a control freak and It’s incredibly easy to piss me off, but can be hilarious fun. These are all things I’m slowly growing out of, just pray for me. There is a long string of depression, sexual abuse, addiction, and suicide on both sides of my family. we’re all very smart, but very ill. My ???????? must have started from the abuse of a babysitter, leaving me with this “beautiful” mind. Ever since then, I couldn’t be left alone with someone else. Thank GOD it wasn’t my parents or family. I got lucky there. Mom, dad and sis, ya did good by me, thank you. I still love and trust them for that an
d I’ve carried good morals from them. I haven’t hurt or stolen from anyone and that might be all I can say for myself other than being my daughter’s best friend, next to her grandmother, of course. I guess I should be proud of myself for that? I don’t even like children, I mean at all, yet they seem to love me for some reason. Cash me outside screaming my face off in a heated argument with an eight-year-old over which Pokémon type is superior while everyone else talks about everyone else. I’ve somehow become the kid whisperer, but honestly, I’d rather just be in my own world high as a kite somewhere. My depression is nothing short of embarrassing. Let’s be worthless. Useless. Let’s be an agoraphobic mess one moment, jumping on furniture the next. Let’s call an ex. Let’s call the president. I believe this started when my cousin _NAME_, who was my best friend, killed himself when I was sixteen. I don’t think I realized how much I loved him, even now, but that mother ?????? was my favorite 
person on earth. I at least knew that. And then he ??????? died. Shot himself with a .300. I think this was my first real taste of betrayal. Abandonment. Nothing is permanent and nobody can be trusted. The world looked completely different after finding out I’ll never see him again. A bit traumatizing? Shortly after that, I cheated on my first lover with a friend of hers in school and broke both our hearts. I really did that. Trauma for everyone. Maybe I can blame my infidelity on the depression? ADHD? My depression now stems from my infidelities and life choices. Hm. I was pretty much stuck in my own hole after that, I had an excuse for everything I did wrong. I would blame anyone else for my shortcomings and I still do to this day. Let’s just say I have a highly toxic, highly addictive personality and female attention is my drug of choice. Inflate me, admire me, cherish me. Look at me while I wave my feathers for you. I’m an egotistical, loud-mouthed show off. Kiss me. ???? me. Love me. I was wired fo
r the rush at a very young age and the results are in. I’m a freak. Not just any rush, mind you, but one that scares the living ???? out of me. Drop me off a ??????? cliff, please. Lock me in a dark room with a stranger. Send me to the nightclub high on acid. Let me watch you screw. Life hasn’t been so calm, guys, it’s been a violent, reckless nightmare. Bloodshot eyes and gritted teeth. You’ve never seen anyone so happy yet so sad…I’ve been an insane fool. I’ve ridden, driven, drank, ??????? sped and spoke as often as I possibly could. I survived on the smell of gasoline and hair spray. Just ???? my brains out honey, you look beautiful tonight. Maybe I’m psychotic? You tell me. I have what they call “Red Cross track marks“ on my left arm from a completely different addiction. This is something I’ve never explained unless asked about, and I’ve never been asked by anyone other than medical professionals or officers. Their reactions are priceless. Think I’m proud of myself? I might sou
nd like it, but these aren’t bragging rights, these are mental scars that will haunt me for life if I don’t buck the ???? up. I have a daughter now, for Christ’s sake…If I were being honest (and let’s just keep this between us), I’m afraid of my own goddamn future. My high school sweetheart and I took each other’s virginity which didn’t help my possessive attitude in the slightest. I became obsessed and the idea of her with anyone else would soon drive me insane. Cheating on her immediately set in the “lockdown” mentality and made all my preexisting problems multiply ten-fold. I tried to control every aspect of her life out of fear of her cheating back on me. I was the most insecure person in my class. The end of that relationship was one of the most miserable and humiliating sites I’ve ever seen, as well as the rest of my break ups and love styles. My mother knows this best because I’ve probably shortened her lifespan through worrying the living ???? out of her with my self destructiv
e behavior. I’m either schizophrenic as ???? or just plain socially ????????, but I couldn’t get a grip when I was near girls. My life has literally revolved around women since then but at least I remember every single one of you amazing individuals. To all of you…I am so, so, so, so sorry. I am sorry. God. ???????? _PERSON_ I am. My behavior, my attitude, my petty, chauvinistic demeanor…I was a ??????? nightmare to you. Especially you. A savage ???????. Downright mean, greedy and disrespectful. Cruel. Honestly, who wouldn’t have cheated on me? Some of you have seen me in darker times than any of my friends or family. Some of you I’ll never see again in my life and you’ll never know how I feel today. That might be a good thing. I’ve had other women, I’ve been the other man, I’ve caught them and they’ve caught me. I’ve had my heart broken six ways from Sunday and so have they, it never ends well. Each and every one of you has a spot in my heart that some hurt and some heal. Addiction no
. 1? Cheating is one of the biggest rushes I’ve experienced in my life but causes an energy-sapping slump that might never end until the relationship does. Be careful. Fast forward to 22, I went into a very legitimate hypomanic phase that lasted for a year. Holy ????, best times of my life. Believe it or not, I truly thought I had what it took to ride my motorcycle to LA and become an actor. I worked for eight months at a car wash and saved 5,000$ with this idea in my head. Everything was in motion, including the idea that I could handle alcohol. ????. Before dying, my cousin _NAME_ was what they call “straight edge” and we all looked up to him for that, so I remained that way up to six years after his death. I was sober even past my 21st birthday. Drinking any amount of alcohol was a huge deal and these were my first experiences in an altered state. 2011 was quite wild. Acohol…Not surprisingly, my most dangerous addiction. Any other drug I’ve ever taken, from MDMA to ketamine, has not only been saf
er than booze, but even beneficial in treating alcoholism (I’m especially looking at you, Lsd). I didn’t drink everyday, I would just black out at least once or twice a week. I never enjoyed the taste of alcohol. Any of it. It was just a very effective tool for momentarily ridding fears of the future, but create more trauma from within. Despite how much flack my family gives me for my fascination with mind-altering chemicals, drinking is what slingshotted me through the next decade of cheating, riding, jail, failed relationships and several near-death experiences. I’ve changed the shape of my body multiple times. I’ve gone sober for consecutive weeks, months and even years, always to relapse. I’ve lost my memory on countless occasions. I’ve woken up with my motorcycles inside, outside, on their side, in pieces and even missing. I can honestly only remember half the miles I’ve spent on the road and the only thing I haven’t forgotten is who I’ve had sex with. When I think about the kind of stu
pid ???? I’ve done and said over the last ten years while drunk, it frightens me, I want to puke. The combinations of words that have exited this godforsaken mouth of mine…I paralyze in horror at the memories that manage to slip back through the threshold of these intense blackouts. If alcohol can be avoided then avoid it, but it can’t, so ???? the world. Because of all the boozing in 2011, I was too fat and lazy to give the silver screen any real attempt and instead rode my motorcycle all over California and the rest of the eleven western, partying my ass off like the future didn’t matter. I eventually came back from Los Angeles with a new addiction and started growing pot. Glamorous. Selling pot from my father’s spare house was a good way to meet many different girls, but learn zero responsibility. Perfect for the womanizer I am, little did I know, I was the one being stalked. One of my customers apparently had an eye on me for a couple years and finally got her way. Probably the most attractive w
oman I’ve ever met, she’s also eight years younger than me, so I honestly never took my chance until I had no choice. I actually knew this person for a few years without objectifying her and just ruined other good women instead, but one fateful day she showed up to buy pot and never left. I had no idea she enjoyed my company as much as I enjoyed hers. She spent every night with me since 02/02/16 and became the mother of my child and the first woman I’ve ever been faithful to in my life…Ironically. Now, when I said alcohol was my most dangerous addiction, I lied, it’s obviously her. Maybe the smartest woman I’ve ever met? Maybe the most vindictive? Maybe I was? How can I tell the difference between love and addiction? Did I ever really care about her like a normal person should? I was absolutely out of control with this one and spiraled back into the land of obsessive hell. I can’t ??????? tell who took advantage of who and that might be the point I’m not getting. I was on cloud 9, twitter-pate
d, dumbstruck. Eyes, lips, hair, skin…Ruin my ??????? life, PLEASE. And she did. Full system shut down on this one, guys. The relationship I’ve had with this woman has changed me as a person more than anything I’ve ever done, seen or heard, for better or worse. I was actually on my longest stent of sobriety when we started dating, but I missed her too much when she would disappear and I started drinking yet again. So sorry, you sad boy. Maybe get a job? Move out? Pay your bills? Stop surviving off daddy? I certainly didn’t treat her like she was worth it or show any ambition to better myself. My vicious cycle just continued and I got very good at ignoring warning signs for this beautiful face. Maybe she just enjoyed a free place to stay and I was too whipped to see it? There were unsolvable issues in her own life and I didn’t want to pay any attention to anything else but how I felt. I didn’t want to believe what I knew, instead I would believe anything she told me and I washed those red flags dow
n with a spoon full of sugar and vodka. My mouth would run for miles on the topic of her whereabouts when I was drunk, the fights were like nothing I’ve ever seen before. The jealousy and projections, the suspicions, the gaslighting…and violence. Until she admitted to it. Damn, four years? So I wasn’t accusing, projecting or being possessive? Of course I was, I’m the biggest piece of ???? on the planet. Right? After all my arguments and being made to feel like I’m sick in the head? My bad. Why would I let these fights go on for so long and not just…leave? Easier said than done, mental abuse is no joke, but a hidden killer. She had me convinced that I was the luckiest guy on earth to have her, especially how well she put up with my “sickness”. My jealousy. I would believe anything for this face. So I’m sick now. Awesome. I just wanted to believe her so badly, I would have been such a fool to leave an angel like this after all she’s put up with and done for me. Yeah. Can anyone imaging what 
this has been like for our daughter? There is no energy left for her once another man comes into the picture. She gets ignored, neglecting, makes messes, gets in trouble. It’s ??????? heartbreaking. I just wanted to focus on other things instead of all her mysterious behavior. I was happy with just her, our daughter and my horrible job. What had to change? Oh that’s right, I was too “sick” to handle and she has everyone including my own mother convinced that I’m an unbearable monster. Here’s the bottom line; if you cheat on your man, whether or not he finds out, it’s going to be ??????? miserable on your whole family, especially your daughter. It looks like my karma has finally caught up to me for all the women I’ve treated like ????. Here we go, the world is completely changing shape and appearance on me again. I didn’t mind when she was giving/receiving attention from other men, in fact, it was sexy. Male strip clubs anyone? Hot. Dress up and flirt nights were my favorite. Could I get a re
al man over here to slap this girl’s ass so ??????? hard I can see that handprint in the morning? Ah, thank you very much, sir. I would just tell myself “she won’t if she loves me” and smile. We’ve been through enough. No more questions, no more accusations, it’s time to start believing this girl you’ve been telling you love for the last four years. It’s time to get down to some real ???????? I was getting so close to defeating my insecurities and becoming someone a woman could actually stand being around, but I guess I was the fool…now this? The mother of my child and love of my life? Just hang me. Of course it’s all my fault, I mean how could anyone blame her after getting knocked up by a low-life like me? I ?????? with her and she changed my life permanently. Goddammit, I am a ??????? idiot. She really is smarter than I am. With a lovely combination of obsessing over her and self-medicating, I managed to destroy three or more vehicles in a matter of months, go through a dozen friends, w
ake up in and out of jail, hospital, home and hell. I can honestly say I’ve never seen anything like this in my life. Not in a movie, not in a book. Write about it. I will definitely say she has given me an incredible daughter, though, and I intend on making a machine out of this child. I was so afraid I wouldn’t love my kid like a normal human should or that I wouldn’t find interest or grow attachment. Now I want to teach her how to protect her emotions and how important trust is. How to help others, learn who needs help most and how to help herself. Teach her not to give a flying ???? about what she drives or how big her house is. Teach her wisdom and self sustainment at a young age. Confidence, esteem, love. I don’t want a dead-beat like me controlling her life when she’s my age. She’ll be untouchable in this modern battlefield of materialism and psychology we have created, mark my words. It’s guess nice to know there’s an actual point to my life now, even though I ??????? hate being alive. 
I was able to do a lot with just a little bit of that love I keep talking about. Since this insane romance has begun, though, I’ve literally isolated myself from every one of my intellectual friends out of fear of judgment… Please forgive me guys, for I know not what I have done, let alone what I am about to do. Just keep those fingers crossed for me, would ya? Oh, and ???? dating. A woman couldn’t stand me right now if my life depended on it, I talk too goddamn much and I’m neurotic as ????. There is way too much of me and I’m still a possessive control freak for that extra pinch of toxicity. I still want to own your body like some kind of trophy, I still want, want, want. I don’t listen either, just shut up and let me see you naked. I suppose nothing really has changed, I’m either a complete child or a truly paranoid psychopath. Maybe keep your distance and try not to say I didn’t ??????? warn you like they all do. Until I pull my head out of my ass, hang onto your boyfriend for me, he’s m
y favorite place holder.“"

It really can make a difference and it’s very common to have sz and depression together.

174386581,"Affirmations is a really good idea I think. Remember we are each on a journey in life, and it is not the destination that counts, perfect health is an ideal that can always be improved upon. When I started doing affirmations (which I don’t do nearly enough) I was very sceptical, but even though they didn’t always manifest themselves, if at all, and didn’t “cure” me, they led me to knew perspectives on life that helped me a lot to progress, particularly in love. I got my first and only girlfriend for one thing. She was also schizophrenic and it was tough. It only lasted six months, but it taught me a lot. I still relapse, but I’m getting better, and still moving on along this journey. I can only imagine what your pain feels like, I really do hope you get better. Anything is possible, and that can be something good to remember when you do affirmations."

176173622,"_NAME_. Come on. We’re a bunch of schizos, just like you. Of course we understand. It’s not us that are disillusioned to your pain, it’s you that’s disillusioned to ours. It’s annoying when you talk about how you’re not getting better because you’ve been ill since you were a child because many of us were. You act like your illness is so much worse than ours and therefore you can’t do anything but wait for meds to work. Only you can. You can do something. You can talk to your pdoc, you can try therapy, you can gradually expose yourself to your fears, anything. But it doesn’t matter what I say, because whatever it is that I tell you, you just ignore it, or stop replying altogether. Like just now, you say you don’t want a lesson. What lesson? The last time I replied to you, all I did was suggest that you get a pet. I mean, what exactly would you like for us to do? Tell you that you had it so much rougher than we did, tell you that you’re sicker? Because you didn’t, and you’re 
not, and I don’t quite see the point in lying to you about it. I told you that I’d help you recover, no matter what it takes, and of course that offer still stands, but I’ve got so much on my plate as it is, and I can’t do it for you. I won’t do it for you. Look, I don’t care if you use this forum, if you use me, as a recovery tool and nothing else, because I can be that for you. You don’t need to care about me or my life for me to be willing to help you. That was never part of the deal, for you or anyone who PM’s me for help. But you’ve got to be willing to help yourself, to push yourself past what’s comfortable or expected. You need a second opinion on your symptomatology, you need someone to help you with some introspection, you need someone to help encourage you to change your attitude. These things are just as important as your meds, which, now that I think about it, could probably use some tweaking as well. That said, I’m not suggesting that you’re not putting any effort in at al
l, because if you weren’t then you wouldn’t be going out or talking to your friends at all. But _NAME_, you’ve got to understand that we all have issues to overcome. You’re not special. Not in this sense, at least. And if we didn’t care about you, we wouldn’t bother replying at all. Just because you don’t like what someone’s saying, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t need to be said. I love you _NAME_. Hopefully, tonight will be better for you."
174386597,My friend is only 33 i think but man he’s a really bad alcoholic especially because he mixes it with his clozapine and abilify. He also wants to use any drug that he can. Ambien?? He snorted a whole script in one night. I’m really worried but there’s little I can do. He’s also pretty overweight and he talked about someone seemed fine then died a few days later and he was shocked. And I just think that could happen to him like geez he puts so much stuff in his body and stuff and it’s just frustrating. I’m sorry. There’s really nothing I can do. I can cut him off?? But then he’d take it really personally and just start drinking more. I know him.

I’ve switched to hydrogen gas infused water, which has an even lower ORP, but doesn’t raise pH so high it disrupts digestion. Hydrogen water machines are $30-150, you can find them on eBay. There are multiple brands though, so I can’t vouch for each one, but you can get a 450 ml model for $30-ish, just to try it out. If it’s only a 3 minute infusion, do 5 infusions. My model does 13 minute infusions at the strong setting, that’s what I prefer. I’m getting an ORP meter soon, and I will measure the ORP of my hydrogen water machine at the strongest setting (mine cost $120 CAD.)

Early on in my illness My old work colleagues voice made me feel like I was on camera in my house, they knew what I looked like etc. I honestly thought there were five cameras hidden somewhere in the house. Sometimes I would leave the house to escape his voice which worked because I wouldn’t hear their voice when I left. However here’s the thing. Every time I left in my car and came to a junction, I would see my old work colleague driving by me! Or if it was ‘ownies’ Voice (I met him in real life) I would see ownie in his car driving by me at that same junction! It’s as if they left the house they were monitoring me from because I left. How is this possible? How did I meet these people in their cars minute after hearing their voice? Whosever voice I heard I would meet them in their car minutes after!

174386600,"Yeah. “Around the block a few times” is a very accurate epitaph. I’ve been struggling with SZ from age 16 until now (58 in a couple of weeks). I’ve been on every psych med in existence I think. When I was wanting to get pregnant we were, naturally, concerned about what meds to put me on that wouldn’t harm the baby. There was a new 2nd generation med on the market which had not yet been tested in pregnancies. (Loxitane or Loxapine) Since all the others AP meds had warnings against pregnancy, the doctor put me on 5 mg of loxapine. Well the response i had to that tiny dose was astounding. I got well!! Not 100% but maybe 95%. And throughout the past 30 years, that med is really the only one I have responded to (although now I take 300 mg instead of 5!!)

176173689,It’s your mind playing tricks on you. It’s a delusion. Most of us have them. Part of you knows it’s not true.
176173690,_AT_MENTION_ Thank you for sharing your TEDx talk. I watched it and it was very well done. It’s really wonderful that your friends have sent you supportive messages.
176173691,"Part of the modern day treatment of Sz is normalisation, i.e. the realisation that many of the things we experience as patients are also experienced by normies. This relieves a lot of the burden of self-_USER_ID_ and makes us realise that we’re not such bad people after all."
176173692,I’m so sorry _USER_ID_ i don’t know what to say. just sorry for your loss. There is more progression to an end by the day here
176173693,"I just took my first dose of Amyloban 3399 this morning, and I’m feeling some low blood pressure symptoms I haven’t had in months. Does this have a side effect of lowering blood pressure?"
174386598,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ i know you are indeed special
176173694,it sounds like you are very sick _AT_MENTION_ how do you think you stomach would respond to something like ginger or ginger root tea?
176173695,I like you. You’ve been very kind with me
176173696,"I was only a few months on APs when I had a CT scan with contrast. It also showed I had a fatty liver. I couldn’t blame the APs. It could have been my binge drinking for over twenty years and tons of junk food. Don’t be to hard on yourself and the meds. I have read somewhere that somehow the effects of a fatty liver can be reduced. My dietitian said I have a lot of fat around my organs, including my heart. That’s not good news. Fortunately I’ve lost 23 kilogram in the past 4 and a half years. Currently I’m losing about 3 kilo’s a month."
176173697,Sounds like paranoia.
174386606,You’re always welcome!
176173698,"I’m still afraid of going to hell but people here seem to be afraid of that. I just feel like I’m different than everyone here. I feel like my therapist said that God wouldn’t punish me for something I was forced to do. But my other friend said that I would still go to hell if I became the dictator. Basically, I wouldn’t kill anyone, they would just use my presence as verification to kill others? Does anyone think I would go to hell for that? I just feel like this verification thing seems pointless and unreal when I think about it."
176173699,"Yes the serious paranoia was ongoing for I can’t remember how long now I was not keeping track. People were initially just really pissed off with me in my store where I was working like annoyed that I existed and I was a waste of space, then it got more to just hating me to the extent they wanted to kill me cos it was now me in another dimension where that’s just the level of their mindset. I was going thru different levels of hell dimensions apparently that’s why. I can’t remember about relief periods during those worst times. The mild paranoia involves around having a bf and sleeping in the same bed, amongst other things related to a bf. This is one reason I chose not to have a bf atm. One other mild paranoia that I don’t even like to mention. What about you have you had paranoia for a long time and why do u think those people are following u in ur paranoia."
176173700,"It may be. But there’s a lot of people who need protection. You may be living in a dream world, but I’ve had people trying to make sure, for years, that I didn’t have a penny, just so I couldn’t protect myself from a bunch of phony a-holes."
174386601,"My mother also had schizophrenia. She was violent when not medicated, which was every time she got pregnant. She died of Chronic Granulyetic luekimia. My father developed Alzheimer’s when she died and lived another six years and died of a massive heart attack with a cigarette in his hand. I don’t miss either one."
176173701,I count calories. It works really well for me
176173702,No. It makes me feel the opposite of high. I smoke regularly to make myself feel anything at all. It takes a lot for me to laugh anymore. I feel like the emotions in my brain are all messed up. Not to mention I think these meds zap any motivation I may have. I find myself on my phone in bed a lot
176173703,Hope this new med helps you _AT_MENTION_ . Hang in there!
176173704,No problem! Hope it helps you.
176173705,"Sometimes I guess I celebrate my dad on here which feels right to do, too, or simply independent of our differences. Relevant to me here is he said out loud: ‘you can’t live your life as though you’ll be lucky all the time’; which I thought was for my ears. It’s because I’m smoking and hoping for more time on this rock. And because I like risk in the markets. I would say back now toward him, ‘you can’t live your life as though you’ll be UNLUCKY all the time’ additionally. Your poems are really special man… if I were you I’d organize them somewhere if you haven’t already!!"

176173707,Haven’t the meds helped with this?
176173708,"Part of the lost insight is chemical, and part of it is willful. I had an imbalance that gave me rushing thoughts and made me come up with numerous ill-conceived conclusions, but I chose to adopt those conclusions to my worldview."
174386605,You should consult another pdoc as i think you are needlessly prescribed antipsychotics. Antipsychotics if take without positive symptoms can worsen your negative symptoms.

During the school year, I work three part-time jobs, two of them teaching at community colleges, and two days/week at the gas station. I’m hoping to get an interview at a third community college; I seem to have passed the phone interview. If I get that job I’ll just teach at three schools and drop the gas station. I don’t think I could handle teaching full-time at one college. The stress would probably do me in."

176173714,"More typically good making aquaintances rather than close friends, most people just use me anyway"
176173715,That stinks. I like the parade.
176173716,"Thank you, it’s all so terrifying."
176173717,I take 60mg a day and it has helped me out.
176173718,sorry to hear you not feeling well. I hope your meds kick in soon. If you keep getting worse then talk to your pdoc for sure!
176173719,Many you need some time in hospital it might help you.
176173720,Well I’m sorry it’s not working anymore. I’ve been taking Invega for about a year started on the pills then a few months later got Invega Sustenna injection and before you know it I’m on the highest dose 234 mg. After 8 months of no voices the voices are back but pretty faint. I suspect that I have developed a tolerance to the medicine but I still have poverty of speech.

176173724,"Hi, _PERSON_. Long time no see. Glad you are stable and working a good job in Thailand. I believe Thailand is a nice country to live. Please say hello to your girlfriend."
176173725,"For me it caused more problems than just brief paranoia while I was high. It caused my previous symptoms to come back. I would start looking for messages in things, and had a harder time reading situations etc. Also - if it does make you paranoid while taking it - why are you taking it? Ideally it should make you calm/relaxed etc."
176173726,I’m glad you didn’t mean to be mean. But asking an adult if they’re just playing kids songs will hurt their feelings and it takes away from all they’ve accomplished. But you say you didn’t mean it that way so I believe you.

176173731,Did you take any med for Extrapyramidal side effects?
176173732,Never heard of it. Is it supposed to help positive or negative symptoms?(or both?)
176173733,"I was cooking food for my crush to bring to work, then all of the sudden I started hearing voices doing commentary like I was on TV broadcasting or some sort. It gave me commands to feed the homeless people instead with it. Which I did… Didn’t see Sz coming"
176173734,It’s state paid medical insurance. I don’t have any co-pays and they even pay for my medi-care which is federal medical insurance.

176173741,"I took invega sustenna ( paliperidone) it was my first ap, it made me really slow, sleepy, dizzy restless, it made my legs feel really heavy too. I had a lot of other symptoms though can’t remember. I lost 10 pounds on it but some people gain weight on it. It wasn’t working too well for me so I had to change meds.

176173750,i use to think i was close to my siblings i don’t anymore. my brother and sister also don’t like my other sister. and she doesn’t like them. my other sister doesn’t like me either. she’s really cold and distant not only to me but my mom too. i’m alone on the fourth and i told my mom that i wouldn’t go to my sister’s and she agreed. my two sisters will put me down to their kids and that’s what hurts the most. they don’t want their kids to like me. but it is what it is i just can’t focus on it and go on with my life. it would be easier except i live with my mom and have to deal a lot more with them than if i lived on my own. but my mom is starting to need me more now too.

I asked my dad to book her a hospital appt so that she can get tested. I’ve been sitting here, working and crying back and forth wondering what will happen to her. Last night I was crying because of pain, and then night before I was crying because of pain also. I’m so nervous that I’m constantly touching my hair and rubbing it on my skin (a habit I had since I was a child) and rocking back and forth. I feel like ???? for saying bad things about my mom. Yes, she treated me unfairly when I was child but that’s no reason to say ???? about her. She’s still my mom and I love her. I feel like I’m an abomination for going to therapy and saying things about her, when she was an amazing mom. I fee

I feel like, you know, all the whole google or government is spying on me bullcrap and I don’t care that you have to turn it on for it to be working I just want to cover it up. So what can I do to cover it up but still be able to use it to facetime when I want to. Would a sticker hurt the lens? I was going to put nail polish on it but I have nieces and nephews and soon to be grandchildren to facetime with so I can’t do that. So sticker? Or what?"
174386629,I think you’re right. I have paranoid schizophrenia still. It doesn’t go away. I’m taking medication and so far have maintained it for the past few years after years of treatment. My diagnosis was for chronic paranoid schizophrenia. I was so afraid of the label I think I successfully convinced them it was something else. Maybe it’s harder to assess because of the symptoms being primarily delusions and paranoia and thought related ? i know I wasn’t misdiagnosed. I know I resisted taking medication for a long time and when I finally accepted it it helped me a lot. I still have bouts with paranoia and delusions on a very mild scale. I just keep a very calm life. Like I’m eccentric so it’s hard to discern my crazy thoughts being imaginative creative or delusional.
176173824,"Yeah, it’s vital for existence. There’s a lot of talk about securing the basics now during the pandemic. No panic in my country though. People are not stockpiling I think."

174386624,"I know I’ve been here before, but despite the insistence of doctors, nurses, and my own wife, I’m still resisting the diagnosis.

176173827,Some of my delusions and voices I get only sometimes but a few are continously there If they are continually there does it mean I have psychosis almost all the time? And if I have voice attacks for 15 mins at a time about once a week does that mean I have more than one episode of psychosis? Because if it means that then have I had multiple separate episodes?

176173831,Yes. I just have to wait until thursday
176173832,I was waiting for someone to post this!
176173833,_AT_MENTION_ what do you think of this https://youtu.be/lZiZJUX7GLY I haven’t written anything much for it yet but I think it fits both our styles maybe I can save some room for a verse for you to put on my ?????? _USER_ID_ damn it he didn’t make it free. So I can’t use it but let me find another one for a potential collaboration …
176173834,"The separation of care that exists between prescribing and therapy bothers me in general…a doctor is expected to be the expert on their patients condition and know how to adjust their meds when they only see them for 15 mins at a time once a month? I don’t think so. Mental health is too complicated for that. I believe that either therapists should be allowed to prescribe (they are in 2 states) or doctors should have to work closely with the patient’s therapist if not offering therapy themselves. When i become an NP I am going to offer therapy in addition to prescribing so I will really know all my patients. The reason why doctors stopped doing therapy too is because they make double the money that way since they have time to see way more patients. Pathetic, choosing money over providing quality patient care."
176173835,PubMed Peripheral immune markers and antipsychotic non-response in psychosis - PubMed Higher levels of IL-8 are associated with a poor response to antipsychotic treatment. Increased cytokines levels are specifically associated with more severe negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses.

176173838,No they only do it when the TV is on.
176173839,"I’ve experienced this as well but it didn’t feel like they made me dumb, more that they slowed me/my brain down too much to function where I couldn’t do anything but sleep and got severe cases of what my friend calls “medicine head” where you can’t put your thoughts together properly or coherently from having to fight through the fog, either way it sounds like either your dose is too high, you haven’t adjusted to the med or the wrong med altogether"
176173840,I was just joking on the Bigalow. Did you ever see the movie Duece Bigalow? It might be before your guys time. I can understand why people do pay for sex though… I actually think I would pay just to go out on a date with a guy and practice chatting and talking and socializing and just feeling connected with someone for one night. I know I could do a date too. But sometimes they might not like you or not be real nice or whatever too. There are good guys out there. it’s finding them that’s tricky.

176173842,"_PERSON_, sorry that statement is so hilarious to me. I literally laughed out loud. Reminds me of the time I was in the Walmart fitting room trying on bras where they have the full body mirrors. I’ve gained some weight from the medicine and I had the same reaction (minus the evil eye part) when I saw myself in the full body mirrors bolted to the wall. Hey gotta laugh to keep from crying!"

176173847,i hope you not saying you gonna end yourself =/
176173848,Well I can say you definitely have sz. Paranoia and anxiety are highly interlinked. If you want the best outcome stay on your meds.
176173849,The psychologist just did tests again…
176173850,You are not specific about what is happening so I’m not sure what to think.
176173851,NAC isn’t a med. Just a supplement. If you truly have a mental disorder you need real meds. Only a psychiatrist can help with those.

176173859,Yikes. I hope you get well soon.
174386632,I really don’t know. I think most of what I wrote angrily was during the breakdown. One thing I’ve heard said was I could no longer take care of myself. However some things I wrote during the breakdown may have retroactively harmed me. I also think they were angry that I was making no effort to work. I am afraid of all the evidence that the Ticket to Work is designed to get me off of Medicaid along with fears of physical disability if I do work because I am actually weaker than I look.
176173860,"It depends on how good the novel is. I admit the idea of Hercules _PERSON_ becoming self-aware is a terrifying prospect. Still, do you take this self awareness business seriously?

176173864,It’s good that you are able to leave for a while. I did that a lot with my old neighbors. It shouldn’t be that way but in my experience it’s difficult for a-holes to get the message. I had to move. I tried to like the people but I needed some peace of mind. Hopefully something affordable will open up for you. I’m sorry your neighbors are d!cks.

176173866,im looking for mental health or schziophrenia forums…i tried googling but nothing but this site is showing up
176173867,Had breakfast and shopping with my mom and sister. Was very nice. Went to pick up my christmas hamper and it was amazing! Hockey game tonight. Go jets go!
176173868,I had difficulty speaking on both _PERSON_ and Invega. So I know how it is like. Definitely bring it to your Pdoc.
176173869,I take risperidone also. Generic

176173872,"Sometimes, you need to have the “feeling better”, sensation; to heal or move forward. By what you say, you were “replaced for proving yourself unworthy”; would be great to start a talk with a therapist. Therapy might be a good avenue, since you don’t take medication."
176173873,I cant distinguish between belif and delusins. I can swear that all that happened to me is real. And it makes my life very hard
176173874,"Thank you all for the answers… tbh, it’s one of my main symptoms. I do it since a teenager and maybe this low activity and the oversleeping too kill neurons too, idk… Maybe this is a negative symptom of sz? none of my ill friends never slept like this, I lost my life to be like this… It was very upsetting to see my life going by next to me tbh idk why I am such a sz… Tbh, now I am left to heal a bit more only by my efforts, which is a lonely battle, but we’ve tried many meds and they never got me some life. I now prefer to fight with efforts too… idk if I am alone in this… Do you also know if there would be some bad effects too of oversleeping on a normie too? What kind if you could guess? Take care all"
176173875,"Yes, I thought I was getting td for a long time. Either that or some sort of dystonia. I was finally referred to a neurologist by my PCP . The doctor finally diagnosed me with a benign movement disorder that is currently being treated with an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer. This was one of the scariest and troublesome things that has ever happened in my life! Thank goodness it is doing the trick!!"
176173876,"I don’t mind. The pharmacists I have dealt with actually show some compassion, as these meds are not tic tacs. AP’s are heavy duty meds."

176173879,I hope you get to see a therapist enough to sort out your feelings about the divorce. Wishing you a speedy recovery!
176173880,Wow thats amazing. Great job!! I pray for the strength and motivation to keep a job.
176173881,I don’t have to take _PERSON_ now. Partly because it’s summer and partly because I am feeling better. He said if it is too difficult for me to just call him and he’ll put me back on it. I am excited about this.
176173882,"I’m currently on 1mg of Risperdal, which despite it being a low dose slows me down a lot. Are there any other APs that don’t slow you down so much, and don’t make you gain excessive weight?"
176173883,That certainly sounds creepy.
176173884,"I dont think it wont be that bad, im taking care of myself, eating healthy, drinking my fluids, drinking vegetable juice, getting my fiber and protein and good carbs. Taking my vitamins and supplements, also excercise 30-45 mins a day keep your heart healthy, if you take preventive measures your body should could handle medications just fine. Thats my opinion. dont take to heart though. I might be wrong. lol"
176173885,No attorney _AT_MENTION_ I didn’t even appeal those two times I was denied.
176173886,"All of my suicidal ideation and attempts were the direct result of psychosis and OCD, not depression. However, they did result in some depression, fear that I was ending the world by not dying. Do you think this may be happening to you from OCD or psychosis? Like, the depression being the result of such ideation rather than the cause? Because if so then you might need your AP adjusted."
176173887,Yes I’m sure it is psychosis.
176173888,I haven’t tried that. I always take Tylenol and Ibuprofen separately.
176173889,What is your diagnosis? Were you off of work for a while before you applied?
176173890,Most likely she is
176173891,Psychosis is bad but it is possible to overcome it without medications.
174386631,"To be fair, the people who are prescribing medications (whether injectable or pills) are not the ones developing medications. I think psychiatrists do want better meds. _AT_MENTION_ there’s also a theory that some people’s gut bacteria interfere with absorbtion of pills and if so the injection might get around that. I don’t know much about it but I guess it kinda makes sense since the gut also makes neurotransmitters and has a strong connection with the brain."
176173892,I love this! 1515
176173893,"I’m supposed to take 3 10mg diazepam daily. Usually, I only take them at bedtime. They help to calm my racing thoughts. Otherwise, I either can’t sleep or take forever to fall asleep. I’m glad your benzo helped you. I know they can be bad, but I think sometimes they are necessary."
176173894,Not neccesarily true that people will hate you.

176173896,I was nothing but sedated all day. My 2nd AP is reaching steady levels in my system and I want off it. So sedated. I lost my personality

174386644,"When we talking about the schizophrenia . What we meant by the word ""schizophrenia "" ? 1-We are not talking about any of the symptoms /defectives or disorders called schizophrenia symptoms under any name or medical term ,rather we do not give any important to them at all 2- we talking about,the health condition which suddenly materialized in the basic nature of the person in the third decade of his life , this new health condition has independent existence about the inherited biological health condition or the psychological health condition 3- The person can feel,hear,touch and perceive an existence of a new independent health condition inside his inner nature during all period time of waking the person feels the new strange health condition by a mechanism that is similar to the automatic mechanism which make him perceive him self -the new health condition is represented in the inner manifestations of the living strange psychological existence of the things that you called them the hallucinations 
! Therefore,when we say Schizophrenia ,we meant the hallucinations ONLY ,which they are vary different about the personal behavioral characteristics outputs of the human being which you considering them the symptoms of schizophrenia The hallucinations is the (substance/ body /structure /component ) of the condition that you called it the sz ,and it is not a symptom for any condition,disease / illness /disorder …etc ANY person with sz has knows the nature of the sz’s nature by the action of the nature itself without needing to theories ,definitions or medical concepts ,this is true even if the person has expresses about this nature throughout misunderstood words regard with the perceptions of the external listeners ,because the hallucination express about themselves to the person throughout spoken transmitter (audible-voices ) !!"

176173931,Today is difficult. One thing I want to address that I feel like others could sympathize with is the feeling like you have to be responsible for what the voices say in some capacity.

How do you guys feel about this?

I only used it once and was able to punctuate the entire back & forth which was looking quite bad for me. It was an eBay thing which is how I thought of it. You can buy on eBay but don’t try selling or selling anything that valuable. That’s been my take."

174386647,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Correlating cognitive functions to symptom domains and insight in Egyptian patients with schizophrenia. AH _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, The International journal of social psychiatry , Jan 2020 13 Cognitive impairment is one of the fundamental features among patients with schizophrenia. The relationship between schizophrenia symptoms, insight and cognitive domains remains controversial. We aimed to study these relations in a sample of Egyptian patients with schizophrenia.A total of 109 patients with schizophrenia were assessed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th _NAME_.)) Axis I diagnosis (SCID-I), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Scale to Assess Unawareness of Medical Disorder (SUMD). Cognitive functions were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). The cognitive function
s would be distributed to cover six cognitive domains: attention/vigilance speed of processing, verbal learning, visual learning, working memory and reasoning/problem solving.There was a significant correlation between all cognitive domains (except attention) and PANSS subscales. PANSS negative and general psychopathology subscales were significantly correlated with five cognitive domains: speed of processing, verbal learning, visual learning, working memory and reasoning/problem solving. PANSS negative subscale was significantly correlated with verbal learning (verbal paired association 1) and visual learning (visual paired association 1). There was a significant correlation between all cognitive domains and SUMD, except verbal and visual learning domains assessed by verbal and visual paired association 1 subtests, as well as attention assessed by failure to maintain set subtest. Only visual learning (trials administered), working memory (percentage error), and processing speed (perseverative responses, and 
trials to complete first category) were significantly negatively correlated to SUMD.Cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia is most likely to underlie negative symptoms, general psychopathology symptoms and poor insight, suggesting that treatment strategies minimizing these symptoms would improve cognitive impairment."

176173960,I have Vivid dreams and I keep waking up throughout the night. Sometimes my mind shuts off and I wake up in peace. But since I started meditating it has been helping me stay calm and relaxed. I was also have severe anxiety and depression but since I stopped watching porn my depression and anxiety are gone. I didn’t realize how damaging porn was until I started doing research on it. I hear random internal dialogues and voices here and there. I remember I was taking a different type of Clonazepam and it stopped all my racing thoughts but my memory went to sh!t. I also have random flashbacks of abuse that I went through as a child and other odd memories and instances that I keep seeing. The thing I’m most scared about is becoming delusional again which the medication has gotten rid off. When it’s raining and there is no Sun is when I get depressed sometimes. Other than that my psychosis is still lingering in the background.

I have my low, low points with neighbor problems or clashing with other people or depression and symptoms but enough good stuff happens to keep me going. I don’t feel guilty about feeling good, I’ve certainly paid my dues. And I keep paying in many ways. I make myself unhappy when I don’t need to, still working on that. Just some thoughts and reflections. Tomorrow may be the day when everything in my life goes to hell but then again it might be a good, pleasant day. IDK.

I could give you a list of what’s good in life and what’s positive but I will just say one: your kids love and need you. Kids are pretty accepting and forgiving and you’re the only mother they have. Life is not a 100 percent bad. You will see this when you start having the inevitable good days. No matter how good life gets there will always be occasional bad days but just the best part of life is always around you like getting out in nature or enjoying a good meal or smiles from kind strangers etc. You just have to plow through the bad times the best you know how and there is light and good times at the end of the tunnel. Good luck and Merry Christmas."

176174062,Has anyone dissected the data or is there any data on _PERSON_? I don’t know what a higher placebo response means.
176174063,I dont know what EPS is man. But i need some benzos or something !!
176174064,I hope it stops for you. I started taking new medication and most of the voices stopped. But every now and then it’s not always voices but a paranoid thought
176174065,I know how you feel but you gotta realize that we all go through treatment at different pace. Those people in high function groups probably went through what your going through right now. You will get there it just takes time!
176174066,"I took seroquel, But I’m not sure if my experience will be like yours. I was on a very high dose and it made me like a zombie. All I did was eat and sleep. Gained a ton of weight. I don’t think it’ll be like that for you being on a low dose. Good luck with it!"
176174067,"I have no idea how the software on your phone operates with this site. Im on a pc, but I do know that the _NAME_ isn’t reading your mind and popping up threads to coincide with them. Even if mind reading and all this were possible, do you have any idea how hard it would be to coordinate the timing of a thread popping up with your thoughts would be. The CIA couldnt do it…the KGB couldnt do it and Freaking Santa _NAME_ couldnt do it."
176174068,Yes. He knows who we are. He can’t express himself. He is down to yes and no answers. It’s hard seeing him like this.

176174070,Basically my question is should i worry about prolactin elevation on amisulpride ? Is prolactin elevation on amisulpride equivalent to paliperidone/risperidone ?

176174072,wow is it that cold in your house? That’s really cold.
176174073,Are you doubting your illness?
176174074,"You may be right though, because you’ve read research, and I haven’t. But intuitively I feel like in some cases (my own) external things contributed to at least some extent. But yeah, I may be wrong."
176174075,That’s my point! They are biased opinions and it just seems studies are pointless if they all contradict each other
176174076,Do they change your meds from the ones you were taking before you got admitted? Do they sedate you if you’re heart rate is high and you’re freaking out?
176174077,Congratulations _AT_MENTION_ and Mr. Star!
176174078,"Don’t forget depression that suffers about 25% of population throughout all their lifespan, there is bipolar that suffers about 3% of population, then generalized anxiety disorder that suffers about 3-4% population. Also dementia is a real problem in elderly that suffers like 20% of Elderly. Then is mental retardation that suffers also few per cent of population. Then is down syndrome. Also dependency on a substance sufferers like alcoholics, crackheads that suffers about 8% population. (when I was at the hospital they have a whole hospital section for themselves). Then there is accidental psychosis sufferers. Also some people are sensitive to stress, anxiety and insomnia that require medication."

Sometimes even then it’s not enough haha…like last year I got stuck on the bathroom floor for 2 hours & missed my morning class. I have to laugh about it now because…well idk what else to do. ;p I just remember thinking “what a s****y place to spend the morning.” Long story short, I dunno…I think what you’re currently doing sounds like the right track. Maybe just amp it up a bit so that you have more (but not a stressful amount) of an external schedule. Have you considered actually taking an auto mechanics class? I know it can be expensive though…"

176174096,Honestly talk to your husband cause sexual assault isn’t ok you deserve better. If he resents you for being put in a horrible situation like that tell him to ???? off. Like you shouldn’t have to put up with that. Regardless of if he’s grieving or not. Like he should be there for you
176174097,"I’m jealous of the life I had before I got sick. I was an academic all-star and my family was always proud to brag about me. Now, they tell me they’re proud of me for being out of the hospital for more than 2 months. It’s sad that their expectations of me have diminished and even sadder that I’ve had to lower my own expectations of me. But I try not to dwell on that former life too much, jealousy over what might have been is just too depressing."

176174100,"They took the edge off, this was years ago like 2006-2009 before more of my chronic pain and conditions worsened. You have to see a pain specialist now to get it if they will at all. I’m seeing one in April to see what I can be put on, I refuse the nerve deadening injections cause I’d be rendered unable to walk or drive and that is unacceptable at age 35. I’ve also tried Lidoderm patches, those are expensive, don’t stick well and my pain area requires 4 of the 8x11 size pieces, so no insurance pays it. I even tried medical taping them on but they still didn’t stick, and I don’t use lotion or anything that puts a skin barrier on."

176174110,I know. But telling your pdoc and following their direction is the most likely way to get well. It wasn’t until I was medicated that I was able to ditch that long list of delusions I showed you. Medication really does work for most people. I can understand your fear of meds though. I use to have the same fear. I’m lucky and have all mine under control with a low dose of Abilify (10mg). I use to be on invega shot and hated that.
176174111,"I don’t shower as often as I should, but I do have a nightime routine where I wash my face and put on creams and also brush my teeth. So at least I’ve got that going for me.

176174112,Call your drs office and ask them about it

176174125,"I think it’s still difficult to tell between childhood imagination and delusions at that age. I was dx at 13, and had symptoms including delusions way before then. I differentiate the two between good and bad. If it was good, like jumping on floor tiles in a pattern because I think it will unlock a secret door, then it was my imagination. If it’s bad, like sleeping in the bathtub because I thought my room was full of carbon monoxide, it was a delusion."

176174141,"Sorry _PERSON_, Sounds like you have some pretty nice parents that you can check this stuff out with them. Always do that don’t go around in the dark. and I had another thought- that your mind may have been preparing you _AT_MENTION_ for being on your own in the hospital by saying that. A little separation from them for a while. I hope certainly that you trust them as they seem trustworthy thus far."
176174142,I am not saying the mentally ill is violent. The mentally ill can be more violent than normal ppl in some circumstances.
176174143,Did I fake it all? Lately I’ve been feeling so weird. Off. Like happy in general but panic attacks about death. I feel like j could die at any moment. Maybe I faked it. I rarely had hallucinations that were vivid. Most were barely there and j made a big deal out them. Maybe my weird ideas were just over valued thoughts like in OCD. I dont know how to not fear death. I dont like talking to people in real life about my thoughts because I know they sound crazy and I dont want anyone to be pushed away.
176174144,I recommend not taking medical advice from anyone here. Your insurance should have a nurse hotline you can call if you have a medical question.

176174160,my values seem to be family and doing the best that i can each day it’s all kind of rolling into one at the moment meaning ‘housewife’ to my husband We just moved an hour or so away from my mum we were so good together - me and her - so long we were best friends most of my life on and off. now i actually do my own cleaning etc. it’s a shame i have to move away to feel more independent
176174161,Everyone has been wondering where you’ve been. Are you ok?
176174162,I would. I would deserve it.
176174163,Thank you? _AT_MENTION_
176174164,"it my second tatoo, this was pretty painful lol. it took 3 and half hours to be finish i dont how did i did it. Artist wow you did pretty good. Omg there so much skin coming off its gross."
176174165,"Thank you very much for the advice, I’ve found it really helpful. I definitely did start thinking on specific things, becoming paranoid, and reading to much into coincidences. The signs in my thought processes and feelings were definitely there. I am due to go back to work, which is a concern but I have bills to pay. I don’t believe there’s any chance of a relapse whilst on medication. But if my Dad who I work with feels slighted whilst I’m not on medication he will start his trouble without any concern for the consequences. I’ve also felt the same kind of break, or feeling in my mind from being around and disagreeing with both my father and nephew who I also work with. So I think going forward I have to very careful around them and reduce interaction with them. Both times this break happened at work after being shouted at by my dad, who becomes very difficult if he’s egos threatened. Unless you do exactly what he says and acknowledge he knows best in everything he gets very angry. He
s behaviours are very narcissistic and he will never acknowledge any fault. With this second relapse all of the exact same triggers were in place in both of my work and personal life."

My main concern is that he will never able to enjoy his life since his mood will depend on what med he is taking. Especially he is so young, the illness will has big impact on his future."
176174168,you’re really sick. Have you tried inpatient? Are you on meds? You’re going down the rabbit hole fast…
176174169,"I hate to break it to you, but you are a nobody and you aren’t on any kind of camera. We all tell you this day after day after day, but you don’t believe us. Talk to your doctor about a possible med change would be my advice. The one you are on is clearly not working."
176174170,"I live a life of solitude. My parents turn the TV and radio off when I enter earshot, and I rarely ever listen to video or audio of people in a busy, outdoor area that people in the background can make mumbly “secret messages” with. That was how I coped with thought broadcasting, just minimizing the circumstances in which it would happen. Now my brain is doing well though, after an alkaline water regimen for 2 months. My voices are fully off, my brain feels more comfortable, but I’m still afraid to test for thought broadcasting since I feel it might break my fragile peace."
176174171,That was around 7 days ago. It just how i feel sometimes. I try to find something good about it.
176174173,I love this. It is so calming and peaceful. Nice job _PERSON_.
176174174,"I guess we’re all a little crazy tbh no offense. I had a normal life I think until the schizophrenia. It’s like my life is so crazy that nobody believes it. It’s mainly memories or in my head. Of other lives. Worse than this one – much worse. Like a different sim or parallel universe, I guess. One that was evil. Maybe I have a genetic anomaly – stuff of fiction. I loop back in time all the time. I would like to find a girlfriend some day. I don’t know. I want to get money first."
176174175,Same thing to me. If I don’t have any strange or vivid dreams which it means the dose is too high to suppress it however daytime sedation would carry on for all day long. So I grew to accept lucid dreams and somewhat learn how to let it go and did not bother me much anymore.

176174181,"I’ve been racking my brain today all day about stuff. Got to talking to my mom about my dad and how he made bad choices with me and drugs. Well 5 min in she’s like giving me the cold shoulder like she’s busy which she was and someone pulled in and was like it’s not good to talk about it all the time, but I’m talking about something serious and need support. I just got off the phone then and said goodbye. She doesn’t understand then all the issues came up again with my dad making bad choices and my mom just giving me the cold shoulder while I was doing drugs. I’m sure she cared but didn’t really show it. I’m getting a real bad time right now and noone to talk to. I’m just lost. Really feel like ending it sometime soon with all these issues coming up again and being alone by myself although I won’t do it I thought"
176174182,I’m more of a seasonal video game player. In the summer I rarely touch the Switch or PS4. When it gets colder I’ll be playing more. And of course my frequent bouts of mini depressive episodes can be a factor as well.
176174183,I hope you don’t have to deal with delusions like that anymore… you’re a good guy and you don’t deserve it. I’m so glad mine stopped. I spent a year believing I was in purgatory and none of the people were real anymore. That’s dangerous on so many levels.

176174188,I hope the therapist helps. You’re not going to die. Your numbers are good. Your heart rate is elevated a little but it’s still in normal range. It can be explained by your anxiety. And it doesn’t need to be explained really because it’s still in the normal range.

176174190,I really think it’s fine to act like a child. It’s just bad I guess when you do it because you are having a mental breakdown.
176174191,"I’m so proud of you, _AT_MENTION_ . Congrats on tossing it! And don’t ever apologize for reaching out for help. That’s what we’re here for. To support each other. Don’t apologise for needing help and being strong enough to ask for it."
176174192,why is it negative if you use it as an escape? Isn’t it good to have some way of coping with how things are even if it is through music?
176174193,I’ve lived in about 8 senior places. It’s no different than any place else. Anything goes. I wish I still had my house. Too bad you couldn’t rent your house until you’re sure. You might hate it.

If I choose to go off the typical AP, and I get hallucinations, am I going to get brain damage? _AT_MENTION_ , ive seen you write many posts about losing gray matter. Right now I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either have spoken word go over my head and forget two seconds later because of being over medicated or be off the medicine (typical AP) and have hallucinations telling me negative things making me paranoid but not have problems with short term memory?"

174386752,"Did you try Abilify? If you want to try it start by small doses and watchout for addiction issues because some ppl get addictions to gambling, sex, eating etc from it. The secret is to find a balance between effectiveness and side effects. I had side effects at 25mg but had much less negative symptoms like anhedonia. Now I am taking 3mg Risperdal and will add 5mg Abilify this week. If Abilify alone gives you side effects, try taking a smaller dose with another antipsychotic."
174386763,"“These “negative” symptoms are so called because they are an absence as much as a presence: inexpressive faces, blank looks, monotone and monosyllabic speech, few gestures, seeming lack of interest in the world and other people, inability to feel pleasure or act spontaneously. In psychiatric terminology: blunted or flat affect (emotional inexpressiveness and apparent unresponsiveness); alogia (poverty of speech); asociality (apparent lack of desire for the company of others); anhedonia (apparent inability to show or feel pleasure); and avolition (lack of will, spontaneity, and initiative).”"

174386756,"My schizophrenia can apply a “filter” to the entire visible area of my view that applies a certain vibe or emotional state to it. It can be “terrified”, “mocking”, “cruel”, “disappointed”, etc. Apparently this filter can be applied to both me, or “another person inside me”. For example the “cruel” or/and “disappointed” filter would seem to be applied to the “another person inside me”, apparently to express their attitude towards me (this often happened when I was being constantly accused by the inserted thoughts about things I’ve done wrong in my life, perhaps to connect those inserted thoughts with that “another person inside me”, as if to express that person would be thinking such thoughts about me). It does not make me believe there is a person inside me - I can see that person is only theoretical, or imaginary. Sometimes it starts physically messing with my body (such as doing faces, and/or swinging with my arms all over the place) and displays related 
mental images right after displaying such “filter”, as if trying to annoy me, or to express that I should be annoyed by such doings. Often it uses such “filter” to express emotions/situations that are completely alien to me - ones that I can’t even name, but somehow am able to understand. In other news, the pleasant taste turned on again for a while, but it turned off as soon as I took the first bite of a cake and felt the delicious taste. The voices said they did it."

I’m only taking 10mg Abilify. Should I talk to my psychiatrist? I told my therapist yesterday when she called that I was being paranoid. What do you think?"

174386799,"She might not understand. She can’t see schizophrenia so she assumes that if you look OK and act OK most of the time then you are capable of living a normal life. A heart to heart talk about your symptoms and how schizophrenia affects you might be helpful and clear the air. When professionals talk about “acceptance” it is usually in regard to the sufferer. Maybe she needs to read some online articles to get an idea of what schizophrenia is about. There’s lots of information out there, although unfortunately, a lot is still not known about schizophrenia. Uh, I seriously doubt she hates you. Your family may have been blindsided with your diagnosis but if they loved you before you became schizophrenic they will probably like you still after your diagnosis. It’s just that having a family member diagnosed with schizophrenia is a lot to take in. You have to remember, at the end of the day you are both on the same side and she probably wants the best for you because you are her child."

176174458,"My mom thought I had add as a kid. Nobody saw it because I had above average IQ as a kid (120ish). My sister denied it because I played video games all day and focused on that for hours at a time. My grades sucked. My mom comes off as a hypochondriac sometimes, but I don’t know. I struggle focusing on certain things like I couldn’t study math at community college until I drank caffeine (energy drinks) and tried really hard. I believe I ended up re-wiring my brain for mathematics. Luckily, that happened before 2011 (before schizophrenia) and at a young-ish age… I had invisible aspergers and there might be a high comorbidity with add-inattentive type. I’m never hyper-active at all. I think it could be schizophrenia exacerbating my cognitive deficits for sure."
176174459,"Hell ya. I always hear the “voices” like “you are the weakest link, goodbye”. lol. Or something about survival of the fittest, except it’s survival of the weakest in my case. It probably has to do with me being on benefits and living at home. The world can be cruel…"
176174460,Like my therapist would give no response to my major delusions. But if I said something less about myself or very unrealistic sounding she would tell me that it’s a delusion. So she wasn’t crushing my delusions but she was trying to Bring me back into reality too.
176174461,"I have this, it is absolutely awful feeling like everyone can read your mind and that people are playing your thoughts on the TV or radio. When I was in the hospital things they said on the TV correlated with what I was thinking, it freaked me out and made me have a panic attack. The radio has also done this. There have also been very strange “coincidences” that happen right when I’m thinking a certain thing, and it seems the universe is responding to my thoughts. Klonopin helps a lot when I’m having an episode, and I have had less problems with it since getting on antipsychotics. When it was happening I would sometimes get angry when people would ask me questions because I thought they already knew what I was thinking. Sometimes I wonder if it’s still happening, but the meds just cause me to not notice it. I often wonder if older people have the ability to read minds, particularly old men, and it’s just a well kept secret. (I’m a young woman)"

176174464,They think their everyone or should i say i sometimes think i’m everything and they play along. But they did make a story where reality is a simulated reality in that its a computer simulation… that resulted in quite a few interesting conversations and if it turns out they were telling the truth all i can say is that i trust none of the brains and yes that includes you mom. I also had one voice act like he was a reality shaping devu and then there’s god who i’d guess does the same thing so they may not be reality but they sure influence it.

176174467,"Im not sure. But for me personally i found rolling tobacco to be very high in nicotine. My brother and I use to buy tubes and pouch tobacco. He often would only smoke half at a time. Unfortunately i dont know much on this though. Its worth trying im sure. Have you looked into sub ohm vaping at all? You can get all set up for about $100 and juice is pretty cheap. If you smoke for more than the nicotine, the flavour etc, then vaping can be difficult as it doesnt offer the same arrangement of taste you get from tobacco."
176174468,Do you remember your BMI on abilify and latuda?
176174469,Good to keep the practice up. I’m determined to keep my exercise up. I would like to pick up a guitar again but not really in the coin to get one. Anyways.

176174472,I would wait for it to arrive in Canada It’s coming out soon there.
176174473,"I was in a CA meeting years ago, a big one, more than 75 people. I kept to myself in meetings for the most part. People recognized me and I talked some but not all the time. A lot of those people were hardcore: many had been in jail or prison, been homeless, dealt drugs, were violent, the women were often hardcore too. But at some meetings, some of them would take a shine to me and greet me or be friendly. I could have made friends with them if I would have put out the effort. I got rides home sometimes from various members. But AA, CA and NA have great diversity in meetings. The Big Book even says it, To paraphrase: “We are people who would normally not meet or sit together, we are very different but we all have a common purpose, to help each other get clean and stay clean.” So yes, it was an odd assortment of people sometimes. Wow, this is the longest I’ve gone, just to make a joke. One night I was in this meeting and I was sitting in my chair waiting for the meeting to start. There happen 
to be three rather tough looking guys in the chairs in front of me talking among themselves. I couldn’t help but overhear their conversation and they were talking about Texas. I forget what they were saying about it but I had a joke I learned years before. (Which I’ve actually used on here a few times). So they were talking about Texas so I leaned forward and I smiled and I said to them, “Hey, I heard they found a new use for sheep in Texas. Wool.” It’s an old joke. I expected them to laugh or be friendly but they all turned around and gave me a real unfriendly, cold look. They looked mad and I even thought for a split second they would get up and hit me. I stopped smiling and they looked at me like I was crazy and turned back and ignored me and started talking amongst themselves again. It seemed funny later but I knew I made a mistake at the time. I mean most people are nice in AA or CA but you still have to be careful and remember where they came from."
176174474,"I’ve been on AP’s over thirty years. I’m starting to see things out of the corner of my eyes. I’ll see a shadow, and I’ll think it is a cat. I’ve been doing things like that for about a year now, I guess. I’m wondering if I should talk to my pdoc about them. He might put me on other med’s, but I am happy with the med’s I’m on now. I don’t want to change."
176174475,"Good advice, thank you. I will recommend to my doctor that I start on a low dose. I always ease into using any drug."
176174476,No one’s contacted me like that. I had a call from the FBI because a peer of mine wanted a recommendation. I did not call back. My ex-boyfriend worked with someone who was a GOP operative and he once told me that he thought his grandparents worked for the CIA. I’m worried about my situation because my current boyfriend who I thought was a spy before but now think is the devil (crazy as that sounds but the devil does exist in religious records) says that I’m not delusional because my thoughts are founded on logic. So now I’m paranoid that the things I’m afraid of will happen. I’m scared I will go to hell as a result of being taken away since I will be coerced to do bad things and since these bad things constitute grave matters I can still be held responsible and sinful for them. Not a good situation to be in and the only escape seems to be death but killing yourself is bad too. So what can I do?
174386811,Sounds like too much dopamine was still getting through on abilify. What if you added invega ? Would this keep your addictions under control and ease up your negatives
174386810,I’m an alcoholic. Nearly 6 years sober. Let me tell you that the day will come when you want to quit booze but won’t be able to. When that day comes you’ll realise schizophrenia isn’t that bad.
176174477,No we don’t. We are not doctors and that is the point of it. We just deal with our lot and suggest things as we can. You seem hung up with credentials. It’s peer support here as you know. We just advise as we see things that affect us. Please. Lose the agression.
176174478,Is this really true? I want to try quitting my meds sometime in the future.
176174479,"They’ve taken away every single good or pleasant feeling there is. Often they apply a ‘fake’ pleasant taste and say if I enjoy the fake pleasant taste it’s going to have a bad effect on my soul, and that it’s going to help in torturing me after death. There is nothing I can do if I feel the fake pleasant taste while eating, and they say I’m enjoying it. There are different kinds of fake pleasant feelings. Some of them seem to have the purpose of making me not understand whether something tastes good or not. Then the voice(s) tell if I can’t tell the difference it’s going to affect my soul and help torture me after death."

Have you been whispering inside your head excessive self criticism? Sometimes the depression is short lived while you need to experience it to learn something. If this is true, you will need to try to be patient. Sometime depression seems to last of weeks. I don’t have any simple answers for that. I think “ifeelblessed” gave some excellent advice and I think you should give her ideas a chance."

Cauliflower rice is good stuff-- such an easy side to make for dinner. Oh, and blue stilton is smelly and delicious! Your resting calorie base seems low, so not a lot of wiggle room if you’re trying to lose a few pounds. Pretty sure mine’s around 1100, so that’s not very high either, unfortunately. Best of luck!"
176174522,"As I said in another thread with _AT_MENTION_ , failures are steps on a pathway to success. I failed a lot of engineering classes in my degree due to massive depression and anxiety. Some of them twice in a row. I felt hopeless, worthless and an overall piece of human sh!t. My family thought so as well. But you know what? I snapped out of it just in time to get back on the right track and, with the help of a therapist and medication, I finished my degree. What was my GPA? Not good. But I worked my ass off and Im damn proud to call myself an engineer today, one on track to getting his masters in the nuclear field. You can do the same. You failed. So what? Own it and step back up to get knocked down and down again, so that one day you can stand up and take the hit without blinking. It will be work, but getting down on yourself wont help you.

176174527,One thing I do before I hit crisis level is to work in my art journal about what is on mind and after looking analysis what I see what is really on my mind and then journal about my thoughts.
176174528,"No, that was my point. You don’t know, which means “nothing” is an assumption. In fact, you don’t even know if your memories are real.

This is definitely a good thing that people are aware that “mental health” is a priority."
176174540,I rent a apartment that my former stepmother owns. She is one of my closest and I get cheaper rent. It’s a somewhat expensive neighbourhood so I could not afford renting with out help. I have family near by that help me a lot. I was living in a perfect home with perfect dogs and perfect boyfriend but left to become vegan. If I was kicked out and had to take care of myself I would move to SA around area where I used to live. It’s more affordable rent there. Cheaper to live. In Sweden I lived by myself in a apartment the government rented me. I lived with my former stepmother for six months last year before this apartment was available. I was in bed 7 pm and she was getting home from work 9pm. I had my own bed room and stayed there mainly. I would hate to live with my mum and dad because we fight so easily. I annoy them I think. We would fight constantly. We couldn’t stand living together. It is not ever a option to live with my parents. Even if I was homeless I would not live with my parents. I 
don’t think. I buy ready made meals. I am pretty independent but get lots of help from family and government.

176174542,"I never owned a business. I wanted to but never worked out. Some people are crazy smart and have high energy and can do school, work, and start businesses. I was never like that especially after I transfered. I got weak or schizophrenic and just saw everyone fly past me in life. I was never the same. It would be nice to have an electrician company or something, but I’m 31 years old and just starting out in life again. Like how to use tools and stuff that I never picked up. I was hitting the books too hard for years and the past 10 years was just staring at grass trying to figure out what the ???? happened to me and smoking cigs and trying to decipher things like reality and what and what isn’t real…"
176174543,Yes something similar has happened to me
176174544,They share similarities though Also there is a reason why autism was called childhood SZ back in the days

174386833,I thought you were teaching in Thailand?
174386829,"Well, it wasn’t blasphemy. It was an interesting listen. I guess it has to do with how your brother is quiet and controlling, and you wish he’d talk more, and you want him to reach out to you so you can have some fun times. I can’t just put the words in a mental vacuum though, I keep connecting them to my crazy schizophrenic narrative, so that kind of messes up my interpretation of things."
176174546,I take Lunesta. I recommend that or Ambien but you need a prescription. If you don’t take it often _PERSON_ will work until you can get in to see your doctor. But I take 50 mg a day for tremors. It doesn’t make me tired anymore but I have relied on Lunesta for years. It will put me to sleep suicidal. Good stuff. It doesn’t work for everyone though.
176174547,"I don’t mind having my emotions dampened a bit. I used to be a very emotional person, others would say I was too emotional. Now I have better control over myself. I did miss being able to cry when I was on Invega, though"

176174551,Good luck _AT_MENTION_ . You deserve some more positive things in your life and wish you well with it all.
176174552,i hope they won’t cancel the appointment. good that you ask for some clarity!
174386840,"Yes _AT_MENTION_. Here is my history. Olanzapine to Abilify (weight gain), Abilify to Risperidone (excessive risk taking and impulsive behaviour), Risperidone to a very low dose of 50/50 Abilify/Risperidone (severe negative symptoms). I guess he thought the severe negative symptoms were worse for me than the risk taking since all my money was gone. I don’t know what rationale my psychiatrist relies upon when making his decisions but I trust his professionalism and sense of duty of care. There’s always complex outcomes from the use of anti-psychotics and sometimes lose-lose tradeoffs. Now that I’m on the lowest possible dose of risperidone I feel that my negative symptoms have improved somewhat but that may also be partly a result of my blood sugar becoming better managed as a result of my Metformin dosage having been doubled."
176174553,I’m still alive! But I didn’t notice any significant changes yet.
174386831,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . Try an antidepressive with stimulant qualities. I have been on a combo of Effexor and Mirtazapine - the compo is called “California rocket fuel” because it’s very potent and it does not affect dopamine - so you would have no problems with psychosis. It helped me quite a lot, but in the long run i had to switch to an MAO-I, but that increases dopamine."
176174554,"I understand…the emotional abuse can be devastating as much as physical abuse. Can you prove any of the threats? Did you record anything or saved e-mails? Has he ever been psychologically tested? Do you have a good lawyer? Is there anyone who can testify? Dont lose hope and always stand for your children. If you want to know what helped us (legally, emotionally) or need to vent, feel free to pm."

176174560,"Wow, Fkn A Wow."
176174561,So many people afraid of what we might do Nobody bothers to find out what we CAN do
176174562,"Well, you know that my father was beating my mom and sister till death all his life and we lived in an very awkward environment with this… But he ended up in depression and even psychosis and died from it So maybe he was sick too… For my family, they think that my illness is just genetic. They deny that i suffered from traumas, cause they think lots of people had it bad, but didnt turn sick and overcame the traumas… I start to believe lately too, that its genetic… I was very unhappy kid too btw, in a real pain even… Which is strange to be so unhappy and somatic and sick since kid… Is sz genetic? mostly genetic mostly traumas -both no one knows it, not even the docs 0 voters Tbh, my docs always asked me if we had other sz cases in my family…"

176174569,"I told a new friend that I lived in a home and his reply was “oh, they don’t scare me.” like maybe a denial a little. We do get hard to live with here, most of us damaged from less than happy childhoods that suffered neglect. So we tend to need attention like kids and tend to fight like kids. I call it being snatchy because if there’s attention to be had we will fight to snatch it up."

176174572,I hear you loud and clear. I recently quit a gas station/fast food job. I hated it; only lasted eight months. I wish you the best in getting out of there or cutting down your time there.
176174573,I see that you have a bunch of stressors.
176174574,Sounds like a panic attack
174386845,I had hypersexuality on Abilify. They say dopamine agonists like Abilify increase sex drive. Now I have hyposexuality on Risperdal. I wonder how I will do on Zyprexa.

174386841,"Hi Schizoaffective here. Tried Cibiday CBD paste 25% & I swear went from psychosis symptoms twice weekly to twice a month (5 week period before switching to oil.) Cibiday is kinda outer stock in UK & other brands are not effective. My psychiatrist was skeptical & is quite right in saying it’s not regulated like pharma. My psychiatrist got me signed off his caseload on the strength of my experience & lying that about the frequency as thought had it in the bag. My religion preaches we can always control how we react if not our circumstances, but believing in the Devil can trip one out. Anyone attest to the efficacy of CBD for Psychosis? They are trialing it in London & it is more effective than double blind placebo & is genuinely creating excitement with those crazy medical boffins!"
176174595,I’m pretty sure the medication tries 2 reject it. I got high a couple times on medication (stupid I know) and I sneezed a couple times. People say that they use it for anxiety but I think it causes more anxiety than it prevents. Weed is a definite no-no for SZ on meds.
176174596,"I also feel like it increases my cognitive function in moderation. 2-3 cups a day at most. Any more than that and my mind moves too fast, I get anxious and restless."

Unfortunately I also went bonkers, so I have to stay on my meds. Not sure what the solution is, maybe Cialis or Viagra I guess. Anybody have experience with those drugs?"
176174608,Kind of a tautology there in the thread title. I think II understand your question. I’m prone to violence. I’d say I’m no more prone to violence than a neurotypical who is prone to violence is.

176174611,"My mom was in this one too. I was supposed to be home (with her for some reason, even though I was adult) but I was out with some people and my cousin and my meds kicked in and I couldn’t drive safely back. So I had to wait. While waiting I went on this journey, of sorts that was trippy. One of the people that was with me was my daughter and she wanted to leave with some other people to go party, I was trying to get her to open her car door to tell her I couldn’t drive because of my meds and when she finally, finally opened the door the car had been moving onto a busy street and we talked quickly and slammed the door fast so they could get out into traffic and I got stuck in the door and dragged alongside the car for a good stretch of road. The stretch of road was all old gas and service stations and everything was shut down. We came to a large highway and that’s when I realized I had to get back to my cousin who was waiting in the car for my meds to wear off and for me to drive home. So I sl
id back down the road and wasn’t feeling better yet to drive. But I had noticed down that road there were truckers carrying empty oil containers heading to _USER_ID_ and I was concerned that the hadn’t heard about the oil deal so I went back to make sure that everything was ok with their mining. Eventually I made it back home from _USER_ID_ and after falling on the ground and not being able to see I finally was able to drive us back to my Mom’s house. I went in there at 3 am. My Mom woke up at 5 am and got up and all dressed to go to the store and got out a bunch of money. I was sleeping on the couch and she was laying a guilt trip about having to go to the store. I said I would go after I finished my coffee. And she gave me a look. So I got up and started to get dressed to go to the store."
176174612,To _USER_ID_: did you ever try taking cough syrup in. high doses. It’s called DXM and they even offer it now at offices. Maybe try that. When I’m on DXM I’m happy.

176174616,I like that they think I have psychosis NOS instead of schizophrenia it suggests to me that they think I have more chance of being able to come off meds. And not relapse. But ya never know
176174617,I am afraid of getting personal with women for the same reason that rejection is very likely. The bottom line is that I don’t have a good story to tell. In spite of that personal reluctance I would advise you try to talk to her and see how it goes. You won’t be any more lonely than you are now if she rejects you.
176174618,I hope your side effects subside quickly. My side effects subsided within 24 hours except for a lingering headache (the headache is milder than it was yesterday).

The staff were really friendly and we shared a laugh about the bad parking and how narrow the parking spaces are when you finally find one. It was mostly women around my own age. I got to the chair and the doc was really friendly. It took 10 seconds for him to see how it healed and it was fine and on my way out the receptionists were still friendly and all in all it was a good visit. Now, I’m back in my apartment in the dungeon of the evil and sadistic neighbors. I would tell them to go hell but that would be a compliment."

There are books that claim to teach some wisdom, like _PERSON_s Thinking Course: amazon.com _PERSON_ Thinking Course (new edition): Powerful Tools to Transform Your Thinking 4.1 out of 5 stars, $16.71 There are also people that try to increase intelligence, like Dr. Win _PERSON_: winwenger.com Project Renaissance with Win _PERSON_, Ph.D. I’ve looked at many techniques for trying to increase wisdom and intelligence in myself. Eventually, I put reminders for many of those techniques in my 432 line personal wisdom poem. I think that this is a journey you may have to take for yourself, though."

176174636,"Everything in my life is going great right now. So I don’t understand why I am so incredibly stressed every day when I get home from work. I do have a very high stress fast paced job. Probably about as high stress as a job gets. I cannot turn off that nervous energy when I get home it just keeps going. The only thing that seems to stop it is alcohol or Ativan and I don’t want to become dependent on either. I have tried everything else, short of exercise as I have a knee injury though once that recovers I do intend to try that as well. I try snuggling with my boyfriend, watching silly fun shows I like, reading, playing videogames, showering, playing with dogs, watching asmr, spending time with family, listening to music, i mean i have tried it all. Nothing gets rid of this horrible tension in me except alcohol or ativan. I don’t know what to do."

176174642,It depends on the mood. Online friends doesn’t count at all in my perspective
176174643,"Yeah, I get sort of the same thing. If I bring up my condition they are like: “You’re still taking your medication right?” So from now on I won’t talk about it, unless I would need help because of a relapse, but that’s not likely to happen as long as I take the meds."

176174657,"That I want to leave my husband. I had posted on family whatsapp group that he’s in hospital and she phoned me and after I told her what happened with him, I confessed that I want to leave him. This upset her so much - she said I can’t leave him that he was there for me in my breakdowns and hospitalisations that we’re made for each other that we balance each other out hormonally that he loves me deeply, even though he doesn’t tell me that we’re the best thing that happened to each other that I’m going to regret leaving him that he needs me and I need him that marriage isn’t easy - there will be sacrifice that being single isn’t easy and I’ll be alone when I’m old that his family don’t care about him except to give food that he was very handsome when he was younger and the girls were queuing to see him or call him. When I asked why he didn’t get married sooner, she said one of the rejected girls could have put black magic curse on him (?!) his siblings and mostly his brother 
probably jealous of him Etc etc… She wants to even send me gifts from UK (where she lives) to get me to stay with him. So I was half forced to give her a list. Oh God! She doesn’t understand it’s not his illness that I want to leave him for but his insidious negativity over the years that eroded me away. He’s a good and loving person but I feel depressed just thinking of how argumentative he can get and how I have to conform to his strict religious views. I can’t practice Islam in easy way around him. She said he loves me deeply but I just feel so suffocated. If there’s one word to describe my marriage it’s this - claustrophobic She doesn’t understand I need to look after my own mental health right now. This isn’t about just taking a break, this is about making a break. Wtf to do???"

174386862,"I recently came across a study in which the ratio cortisol/DHEAS was found to be consistently higher in persons presidposed to repeated bouts of heavy depression. It was not affected by psychotherapy and drugs, even when the particular bout of depression went away, the ratio stayed, and the higher it was, the more likely the person was to fall into depression again some time later. Not a huge study though, and when I tried looking for some review or _NAME_-analysis I found a review that said that the accumulated evidence so far is not conclusive. But it’s still very interesting."

176174682,"hmm im not too keen on my drugs yet so it wouldnt be right for me to comment on that. I want to say its an AP ans thus interatcs with your hormones and all that ????, and being an ap well its either that or insanity. Diet is very important because if you use more than you eat you can lower the levels. Thats great your getting adequate exercise, its hard for many of us particularly me. I do 2-3mile walks in the mornings during the week for the past three five months but havent been losing weight, at least I havent been gaining tho. My friends and family say its because I drink all the time but when I do I usually skip a meal cuz I ll drink like 3-4beers. I think its from my AP. So I guess we can say we have one thing in common, lifes dealt us bad cards, but at least were proactivly doing something about it trying to get healthy. ‘good on ya mate’"

174386864,"Ya, you’re sensory perception is probably off. Your brain is struggling to make sense of things because you have schizophrenia and psychosis. The voices, don’t help. Don’t entertain them. Focus on positive things like productivity and what will move you ahead in life. I should do the same too. I’ve been reading books that interest me and I’ve been planning on taking a class on Coursera. Maybe challenge yourself by taking a free online class with other people. But remember to think rigorously when you say things because otherwise it could be viewed as a delusion."

It is heartbreaking to see some get worse, but then when they get back from hospital and post with a little more life experience it seems that things work out. I try my best to keep things positive, and motivate others to try and go for what they want. It’s takes a lot to push yourself with this disease. I was really excited when you took that class this past spring, as its always great to have other college students here on the forum. best wishes"

We definitely don’t want it totaled out because it means we’d have to give him my husband’s car, and my husband would have to take my car.

176174720,Hello I was very embarrassed to tell me doctor about this but I have had to google it a few times and tonight I have finally seem several articles about increased sexual desire on it. It is actually an unwanted side effect for me and puts me off taking it as it feels frustrating. This may be a potential breakthrough for women like Viagra was for men. Its great we can share our experiences like this as the drug companies aren’t doing enough research yet. I only take 75mg. Can people tell me if increasing it might settle the feelings?

174386884,"I now take paliperidone and it’s pretty ok. My disease was activated with a very big scare, i thought that i would die(it happened after a big effort in heat, at tennis) and i was wondering if an opposite experience, love, happiness and gentleness could heal that scare and heal my disease. I mean, i wasn’t hearing voices before. I read on the power2u website that recovery is possible."

176174802,"My sensory problems were nonexistant until schizophrenia. Then it turned into hell or worse, but i cured my sensory stuff. I figured it was a bad drug trip, schizophrenia, trauma, and aliens…i have a diagnosis of aspergers and schizoaffective disorder. Its like after the drugs and trauma, i retreated back into my shell/head like severe autism again. I got out of it 10 years later. I figured it was evil people with power like illuminati or even just bad actors…"
176174803,What beautiful positive words. Thank you I want to lose weight this year and get back to the gym and get another little Tattoo and start saving for a big one of my sacred neigh I want. I want to improve myself inside and out. Hopefully I can afford some maintenance of my body that makes me happy. I want to lose about ten kg. Possibly more but in a healthy way. I would be happy with eight kg or even five. I want to drive more independent and date go to a shopping centre by myself.tattoo
176174804,"Just speaking for myself, I break it down like this. Depression for me means a hopeless attitude, my thoughts often turn dark and suicidal, heavy sludge of a hole, and an emptiness. Negatives tend to be my dulled emotions, my lack of wanting to bother with this life, my lack of enjoyment, my inability to notice goal driven activities. They can certainly overlap with symptoms."
176174805,i feel the exact same way.why bother living if im not happy.and i dont enjoy anything.

176174812,"Back when my daughter had a dog, I wound up being the one walking it. Challenging as heck when you have a dog allergy that requires an epi-pen. I wound up wearing a hydration pack for the longer walks that kept water cold. It was for the dog. I had a collapsible water dish I could keep in my pocket for the pupper. It needed a drink every so often on warmer days."
176174813,"Vape, take a bath, listen to music, go walking outside or pace inside, play the piano, paint, watch funny videos, talk about things with myself, hang out with my sisters, brother and my mom. See my dog. All these things help me cope"
176174814,What is a mirror? I searched for it on Google and couldn’t find any results? I’ve never heard this word before. Is it a new technology or app that isn’t popular yet? Just kidding of course. The mirror recognizes my face as I pass.
176174815,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176174816,_AT_MENTION_ that’s super disappointing to hear. I need positive results now or else I’m afraid I’m gonna hurt myself or someone.
174386892,"Yeah thats what it means, none of what you were thinking is logical fits well into a fiction book maybe but when you have psychosis you lose your mind thats why its important to take your meds."
174386897,I once got risperidone for treating OCD-like symptoms. It made me tired and seemed to stimulate weight gain. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) is also regarded as particularly good. Amisulpride is one of my favourites; I am taking sulpiride which very similar both structurally and in terms of effects. -_NAME_.
176174817,Excessive feelings of guilt are common among SZs. This is one instance where therapy really can help.
176174818,"I did 20 000 at home when I lowered my meds myself but I was going to get psychosis, started hallucinating and hearing violent voices."
176174819,Just when I thought I was doing ok on my low Seroquel dose (200) which my pdoc seemed to forget to raise to 300 like she said she was. This was Tuesday last week. She lowered my amisulpride to sub-minimum dose (150) and was supposed to raise the Seroquel. Did fine this past week. No delusions of control from the evil spirit in my head. No voices. No agitated feelings. But then tonight I started re-fantasising about killing squirrels and rodents. Taking a knife and…“aaaah! Ha ha!” That’s how I feel. Alien is trying to control me again it seems… I feel at the moment like laughing manically and talking loud and laughing more. But I don’t want to scare my beloved husband so I’m trying to hold it in. Maybe the lack of amisulpride (and Seroquel) is starting to affect me… But fortunately next Tuesday I see my pdoc again. Hope I can control Alien till then
176174820,That’s so unfair _AT_MENTION_. I wish people wouldn’t do things like that
176174821,"That sucks that you don’t seem to be enjoying your holiday much. I have had some horrid holidays too and it’s awful when others don’t understand or don’t care and force you to do things against your will making you suffer even more. I suffered so much swimming with dolphins at sea world while psychotic. It was a gift and they forced me to go although I said no and told them I don’t feel well and I really suffered. I am upset that I did not say no to them. I’m such a pushover. Worse is I feel like I’m in restraint and it’s awful. Like I’ve been in restraint my whole life.like a invisible leash from my “wing” and I don’t want to be everyone’s bi t ch .i don’t want to have anyone do such against my will. I don’t go to the beach despite living close and I don’t seem to stay long or enjoy it much when I do either. The waves are too big for me but I can really enjoy a swim in a rock pool where there are no waves. I loved the gentle waves where I used to live in Queensland 
but did not go for dips often then either it was like someone did not “let me” go for dips or go out and do things often. I was supposed to do activities today but didn’t. I don’t think I will ever fly again. I plan on driving interstate with my mum when she comes from Sweden but I told her I do t want to be gone for long and I need her to try and be understanding and not expect to much from me and expect things I can’t do etc. Hope we don’t fight and that we have a nice time together and that she does come . Worse is when others don’t understand and force you to do things you don’t feel well enough to do and by doing so make you suffer even more.mych more and make you even more psychotic so you need hospitalisation but can only just manage to shower,eat etc Hope you will enjoy things again soon."

174386902,Is this a delusion? I feel dizzy again… Should I call my psychiatrist?
174386899,"I’ve just read this full conversation. I have the same symptoms as you for the most part _AT_MENTION_ but I draw a different conclusion. I had 10 years of severe hallucinations and delusions and other symptoms before being diagnosed and treated with Olanzapine. I responded very well and was able to go home in a few weeks time. It took about 3 or 4 years for the delusions to wash away whereas the hallucinations stopped within a few days. I was left with pretty strong negative symptoms but no positive symptoms. But then after about 7 years I relapsed despite taking my meds every day. Too much stress and a complete lack of sleep for two weeks was the cause. That development convinced me that although I felt pretty healthy I still was living with a monster in my closet. As a result, despite the fact that I detest the side effects of being on anti-psychotics I know I can never go off them. I’m now 65. Good luck with your plans to go off meds. Some people succeed. Most don’t. Try to have a plan set 
up with support from friends and family to help you if you need it. Absolutely don’t try going off meds unless you’re under the supervision of your psychiatrist. Again, best of luck. I hope it goes well for you."
176174823,"thx Italy, Its just hard just now, idk if i can keep this dog, i want to try but i am worried about him, and my friend is a really good guy and i have been trying to help him its just sad, I feel like i’ve wasted a lot of time with my ex gf who i’ve known for ages and it was not worth it, I got loads coming up, Mannn it hard I mean i’m usually ok but it can still get on top of me."
174386893,"Have not be properly diagnosed yet, but looking like psychosis mania ups and downs possibly schizophrenia going by what others have experienced but have been offered medication, ive read through a few posts but would be very grateful if I could have some personal advice,I am currently taking citalopram for anxiety and depression, and have been given the choice of Aripiprazole, Quetiapinre, or Lamotrigine. I’ve read through the information leaftlest but a quick google brought me to here as I would like to know other people’s experiences with the medication."

It’s because my therapist said don’t come if you don’t think it’s a mental health problem. But now I am off my meds and the little blue happy.

I did use an AD for a while. I was much better then. When i quit the AD i was a mess, huge mood symptoms, paranoia and psychosis. Now i really struggle what to do. I hate how meds make me feel and im also still frightened of them subconsciously. I fear they make me less alert to abusive situations, among other things.

176174861,_AT_MENTION_ Funnily enough thats why i didnt pursue the mobility componant on my PIP. In case it screwed the whole claim up. I have difficultys rarely going out TBH - so thought i would be dead honest and not go for the extra money. When i got the decision back - it was agreed by the assessor anyway i had no mobilty issues.

I want to tell everyone that you’re not alone in that feeling, I’ve heard a few people discuss it the same. We like you, you have a place here, and you belong. I’m sorry you feel this way.

176174871,Relatable. I feel if I was to have a slightly better care or support network. I wouldn’t be in a position of feeling like leaving my work. It’s so important because it alleviates the stress or pain of working. And I’m only part time. So I’m not as strong as you are but I’m about half way there — coffee and cigarettes do help.

176174881,"Did you also have this kind of thinking, where you didn’t trust your thoughts? They also race often, they can be partial too… I guess this is hard to recover isn’t it? I find that the paranoia worsen my thinking too… My pdoc was saying, that I lack calm of mind . But if I let my thoughts completely free, I will start to make ‘‘crazy’’ things too… This balance to find is delicate I find… I wonder who also had racing thoughts? Its still some inner dialogue for me… I have some progress in the day, but its slow. But I cant switch anymore my meds and I guess I should be patient. My illness is strange, I wont recover in two months no… I made my peace with this a bit . Did you also get better intellectually, because of the meds? Its good to know . My meds work I find, but I even don’t feel them…"
176174882,"Yeah, you’re right, it’s a craving I’m just going to try forget about it. I have modafinil so I’ll try forget I wouldn’t mix it with anything either (and yes I know sellers mix it anyway but generally risks are like that so idm)"
174386912,I don’t know what my health condition is either. I accept psychosis. But I also claim it was all avoidable and also reversible. So I ping pong between psychotic and non psychotic. Which is enough for me to say I do have a form of schizophrenia that is currently managed relatively well

I’m not as fit as I was before I started, but I lost some weight, and now its on me to diet and exercise. Unfortunately I only really took to swimming and the only place that has a pool open is public so Covid threw a wrench in that, and now this summer is pretty much a wash. I’m hoping to get started back up next year. I wish I could walk but these darn knees just don’t like it, and it takes me most of the week to feel like doing a short walk. I hope you realize that you still have freedom even if its more limited, and the internet isn’t something you get in prison.

I think he’s 26 now and he’s just really recovering but I’d say he’s ahead of me in recovery. He got put on meds at 10 years old. But got put in programs at those ages too. I got put on meds at 20 years old. Now I’m 30. So less time on meds for me. I understand why he’s at a more stable point in life. It’s not like he didn’t so drugs. But i would contend my lsd and magic mushrooms use to a reckless extent was more damaging than what he was doing as far as drugs go. Buuut. I take naltrexone every day and I believe that heals you from drug mental inflictions. Just an FYI there. It’s worth a try if anyone’s suffering from that. Well its helped me And a doctor even told me it helps with it. My cousin may be younger than me, but he’s someone I kinda look up to for his history of mental health and recovery."

174386918,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression and used alcohol to cope before diagnosis, consequently making everything worse. It’s hard to comply with meds and quitting substances at first but they do work better in the long run. Be honest with your psychiatrist about side effects should they arise until you’re on meds with minimal side effects and stable and productive moods and attitudes. Remember though not everyone wants help sadly so as much as you bust your gut trying to help someone, it cant be helped if they never respond. The purpose of your existence and recovery shouldnt be about someone else"

176174954,Zyprexa is a good med for me. Side effects are usually early when you start them and may subside over time. Either way these are the things to bring up with your doc.

176174994,"Ok. I have been struggling with sleep also. I find it helps to keep the apartment dim lit in the evening. I actually use the older model lightbulbs with 15-60Watts, instead of the new power saving ones because they emit blue(unnatural light) which might interfere with sleep, while the old ones have a much warmer colordepth. The only problem is that if you have modern lamps they won’t handle the old light bulbs because they will get overpowered(too much Wattage) and short circuit I guess. The same is true of light from computer monitors, so I use blue light filter on them and try to use my computer and mobile minimal after 9.30pm. Tv is slightly better because you have a passive role instead of a active role like on computers and mobile. The brain gets less stress before bed from having a passive role.

176175038,"Oh I meant in your mind speaking, not out loud."
176175039,Fascinating isn’t it
176175040,I’m currently off meds.
176175041,I live in a house my dad bought me but I still pay him back.
176175042,ECT seems barbaric to me. I feel as if it is very risky and that it is dealing with things we don’t understand. A refined and more exact process in the future may be viable but for now it feels as if we’re just taking a taser to a brain and hoping it works
176175043,"Could be, all you really need to understand or be able to accept is psychosis. Labels like sz or sz affective shouldn’t matter too much at this point bc it seems as though you’ve only had the condition for less than the listed diagnostic criteria. Hopefully it gets better, talk your thoughts out and try to reason things and do lots of reading if you can, it’s taken me a long time (couple years on and off) but I feel like recovery really is possible and within reach if you’re lucky."
176175044,"I take a combination of Clozapine 325mg and Ziprasidone 80 mg. However, the Clozapine has been the best for me. The only major side effect I get is drooling when I sleep. Some drowsiness also but that is if I don’t get myself up and have a coffee to get me going."
176175045,_AT_MENTION_ Can you explain the impotence thing ? Was she joking or … I’m worried now.
176175046,But aren’t we all humans with one soul? Anyways its getting into religion lol
176175047,"15 characters,…"
176175048,You just want to manage the paranoia.
176175049,I have trouble swallowing pills so idk if it would work
176175050,"I could quit for two months with a stop smoking medication. Now I vape and smoke tobacco. Yesterday I tried to quit. After a few hours I had taken the bus and went to the vaping store. Maybe I can get champix in june. I’m unable to quit, everytime quitting fails it drags me more down."
176175051,"If i were you, i would hightail it to the nearest hospital and check yourself in. You sound as though you’re going through a really rough patch, and you’ll need some support. I hope you feel better soon."
176175052,"Sorry reality is shaky for you right now. For what it’s worth, we both can’t be alone here, I know I’m real, and you know you’re real. So why can’t we both be real here in this world? If we’re both real, how many others are real? Maybe everyone is real?"
176175053,"You may want to consider how much $100,000 is in California. When we moved here we thought we were going to be rich because the offer was so high, We were shocked at the cost of living. We’re comfortable, but not rich by any means."
176175054,Not trying to exercise more when I was first diagnosed. Truly. It makes such a huge difference to my now life. Everything else just is or was. Not trying to exercise for years is my only regret.
176175055,they can do to us whatever they want.
176175056,"I vape. it’s gotten me away from cigs. I really am put off by the worse elements of them. The smell. Having to go outside every hour… I don’t really even miss chatting with the other smokers everywhere. Vaping still isn’t healthy, but I know it’s bad press is mainly just propaganda to try to prevent teenagers from picking up the habbit. The was a huge tide of teen vapors… to a way higher degree than cigarettes had held. Gotta be 21 in the states to buy nicotine products… They even outlawed flavored variants… Just to make it difficult for teenagers to enjoy it. ?????? it up for all the adults (damned kids shakes fist.) I plan on quitting but knowing myseld and where I’m at in life… nows just not the time. i got 6 months rent left to pay before I get my own place again. My own place means more control over my comfort… more peace of mind without interruption… and the capacity to actually take advantage of the space in my apartment the way I want to (hobbies) without stepping on 
peoples toes or having to ?????? talk about everything… any time I do anything. I had to struggle for months just getting used to being bothered every time I was trying to cook. Good food… good food is key to transition away from nicotine. This is week three of only allowing myself one coffee while at work… no more… that’s only 4 coffees a week… but I’m already pulling that off. Gotta make sure I get used to that and just make that my permanent rule on caffeine. I also have been trting to replace my bar outings with spiked seltzer waters at home. They cure the itch… really that is more of a financial pressure behind it. Also a financial reward. Certainly has its health benefits as well. And beyond that I’m 3 days into a no meat approach to food. This is my third attempt at transitioning to veganism. It was something I also wanted to put off until i moved so i could have more control over my enviroment… No meat, milk, cheese, any of that in my apartment all… Just veggies to slice and dip 
in hummus or things of that nature… My own little produce rack that I don’t worry about other people touching or clustering with their own produce. I’m ranting again. I used to love cigs… but after about a million nights of insomnia… or just midday onset of hatred and anxiety… The love died… Smokes always wound up leaving me cast out into intense thinking land. I don’t need to be thinking that hard all the time any more. I’d rather start learning that the moment, and it’s associated impulses, aren’t all that important. Smoked for a decade. Had a lot of good times… bonded with a lot of folks just over cigarettes alone. However, it didn’t get me anywhere regarding more important things. A decade of smoking a pack a day is like 30 grand… I could be in my own house at this point (granted I don’t want to live in this ??????? town.)"
176175057,I pull my hair out frequently which is a form of self harm. I usually am unaware im doing it
176175058,I wanted the day off. Had to work! Boooooooo.
176175059,"My Dad was a drunk, and as such, I often experienced abuse from him. He stopped drinking when I was 13, but he didn’t get better all at once. When I was 24 and came back to the home because I had no where to go, his behavior was better. I apologize for the delay in getting disability. It is almost a cruel situation that the disabled adult gets such a long delay in settling things. _PERSON_"
176175060,"They said “we need objective measures” I said in a _NAME_ challenge to all opposing opinions of the world ; There is an eternal failure to diagnose the existential / functional cause which responsible for creating the sz condition itself or its clinically diagnosed symptoms ,because of the wrong idea that driving the diagnostic process or which lead strategies to search for the causes The belief in the existence of a physical factor that precedes the sz ontological and causes its symptoms functionally ,it is that which made diagnosing the sz condition with current diagnostic methods / tools are impossible task and a long-waited dream,a transformation into a tangible reality ! The _NAME_ diagnosing to the casual factor itself will remain the dream that cannot be turned into actual reality ,because the searching for the cause of sz needs to distinguishing between the 2 different phenomena; 1-What are the changes that occur in the human basic nature and cause the sz and its symptoms? -the searchin

174386953,"What can you do and what do you do everyday? I listen to music all day, it helps me."
176175064,"I think it is important to distinguish between being antipsychiatry and simply criticizing the shortcomings of current treatments. It is good and important to voice valid concerns. Side effects, lack of proper care, and over-pathologizing are very real problems that have failed to be addressed effectively. Deciding the whole field needs to be thrown out and replaced with shaman and healing crystals is a whole different thing."
176175065,Yeah thats why I want a job at a supermarket next. They provide vehicles for you so you dont have to pay for the wear of your car. Do you make money on petrol?
176175066,"I felt like this Universe was one consciousness, and I collided with it, but it wouldn’t let me assimilate so I was an outsider from their Hive mind. It was a horrible feeling. I had it during in psychosis."

176175069,"You missed the entire point I was trying toake guys, did you even read what I did write. I tried to make it simple. Here’s another try. Based on what I’ve read until now, the totality of mentall illness would be close to 100% meaning that either everybody has some sort of mentall illness or the percent of these mi are based on the people who go to the doctor. Meaning if 100 people from a town of 1.000 go to the doctor there will be 1 sz (1 % of pop) based on the people who go to the doctor. Until now everything good, and from then on the incredible minds at the statistic board or whatever make up a statistic"
176175070,Not really. Am I missing out?
176175071,Poverty sucks. Not having food or shelter security sucks. Not being able to sleep because you have no idea how to meet your needs in the next day sucks. Not having access to the dental or medical care you need sucks. Being poor sucks.
176175072,It does not factor into the diagnosis at all except that it is used to screen for and exclude other brain abnormalities like tumors or epilepsy. So you should just ignore your MRI results and be glad they are normal. It doesn’t mean your diagnosis is wrong (if anything it makes it slightly more likely to be right).
176175073,thanks _AT_MENTION_ I realize now after this thread that I shouldn’t reopen the spirit portal barrel of monkeys again…keeps me stressed and I am already stressed which is probably why this flare in a residual belief I’ve fought for many years…thanks everyone…

176175083,I glad you’re doing so well _AT_MENTION_ . Happy Holidays!
176175084,It sounds like the therapist with the extensive background in cbt may be very helpful. It’s definitely worth a try
176175085,Did your doctor approve of you going off your meds?
176175086,"I don’t tell people my diagnosis. Not even my own dad. My mom knows, my best friend, one sister, one daughter and my husband are the only people who know. I plan to keep it that way. A long time ago, I was diagnosed with psychosis. I told my dad, and he wouldn’t allow me to see my family. So I lied and told him it turned out to be a reaction to a medication. I’ll never tell him again."
176175087,but brain according to some people very complicated most complicated we need bypass digestive system and medication go to blood by pass liver this called first pass effect and go to brain bypass blood brain barrier around brain target specific areas in brain know the right place in brain and the right receptor we need to target and we need this knowldge to be right we also need to guarantee this drug reach its place not another place which cause side effects coz human body is also very complicated avoid side effects as much as possible in short term and long term sorry for your suffer and my suffer
176175088,"good luck with the change _AT_MENTION_ I got fed up with lurasidone side effects & the constant anxiety of worrying about side effects so I tapered off it in early dec. I felt great for a week then the terror engulfed me. I realised that off ap’s I’m paralysed with constant terror. Now I’m back on a low dose of lurasidone and the terror is taken down a notch to high anxiety. I still worry about cholesterol, diabetes & obesity.

176175090,It definitely sounds like you need a change. I hope your job search goes well
176175091,Who did you met?I presume it’s someone new.
176175092,Yeah i understand that. You have to be emotionally ready or either that or forced into it. i know a few people who quit when a doctor told them they had too.
176175093,My mum has nothing left
176175094,There’s some kids on my block. They run the streets. I can’t figure out how they can hear me when they are two buildings away. How sensitive can people be?
176175095,Come out at ur own will. Don’t fall for these ideal equality type situations u see on TV or the internet. I’ve been out since I was 13. First as a gay female. Then I came out as trans. I dropped out of school twice. Severely bullied. Sometimes it’s easier to be in the closet. I’m 24 now but coping with my life as a woman. Being rejected by girls or being used as sexual exploration or one night stands. I know it sounds really negative. But the real life of lgbt is painful.

174386962,"That’s why I am staying put. this time when I go back I need to keep reminding myself that I am the problem, not other people.

176175098,"I recently learned that my pdoc is moving to another VA facility out of state. I’m going to miss him. He was a good pdoc and a nice person. I’m afraid that because the new pdoc won’t know me or my history, he’s going to change my diagnosis and then I will lose my benefits. I’m really afraid of this. When he evaluates me, I will just tell him the truth from beginning to present and he can take from all that what he (or she) may."

176175122,I’m only on one device _AT_MENTION_ I only use one

176175124,"Im sorta respectful to my Landlord - cos its the local council, so try to be a good tenant like sweep out the back and recycle, and only put the rubbish out when its due. Some private landlord had it in for me tho when i was in some dump with mold up the walls. I was paying more rent for that studio flat - than i do now on a one bed council flat. Im sure she was rigging the electric - it was costing me 6 pounds a day just to run a fridge and a tv. She wound me up one day, so i launched the heater out the 2nd floor window and aimed for her flashy car. Good job i missed in hindsight tho. Flaming old tart. I told her so as well. Ive done my stint with putting up with loud parties and smackheads - with the landlord not giving a toss. But scared? Never."
176175125,Visuals are rare for me but i just remembered all the shadow people last winter no wonder there is real fear of the dark
176175126,It’s time and distance. You get the pills to work enough you can put some distance to them. Still. I’m stable for years and years but still have my moments. Rule of thumb. Six weeks minimum to bite into the crazy. Hang in till then at least. Side effects can be deal breakers but weight gain versus efficiancy is probably the hardest. Keep positive and keep in touch with doctor. Early days you should be seeing a doctor once a week but these days its so hard with mental health system!
176175127,Whats the difference between unrequitted love and that? I never been in love though lol.
176175128,_AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ good luck on the interviews!

174386964,Negative symptoms are extremely bad too.
176175130,"Yes, spot on. I go ahead with what I need to do and tell myself I don’t want to hurt them. And in doing so that helps in some unknown way. I have some faith that it will work and it generally does. I’m having trouble describing it, because it is irrational and only comes up now and then."

176175169,"_AT_MENTION_ , You are 19 years old. Which means you don’t have much work history. Which means you will not be able to go on SSDI. You will have to collect SSI which is different from SSDI. SSI is more of a welfare program. SSDI is an insurance program for people who have a longer work history. My son was on SSI. When people are on SSI, the government does not allow them to work and collect SSI at the same time, generally. Or, if they do, they cannot earn very much at all. My son was only allowed to earn like $50 per week on his job, for instance. But he lived in a group home and resided in Nebraska so it might be different for you."

176175188,"From what I’ve read nicotine can speed up the usage of antipsychotics via the kidneys for excretion. I’ve read a study that said that clozapine is most sensitive to nicotine intake, reducing the amount of the drug by up to 40-50%. This is why it’s commonly known and researched that schizophrenics that smoke are usually on heavier doses, or split the dose/have earlier times for their injection than non smoking patients. All studies strictly were talking about smoking cigarettes. but using basic logic, obviously its the nicotine doing this (look at and compare the pharmacology of nicotine with antipsychotics to see for yourself). so it stands to reason that nicotine replacement to a lesser extent causes this effect too, while vaping, specifically high mg dosages such as that contained within nicotine salts, have more of this action on antipsychotics than does smoking cigarettes. I’m curious if it’s only specific drugs that are sensitive to this interaction. from what I’ve read, as I state
d, clearly clozapine is most sensitive. but what about abilify or invega or zyprexa? what’s their sensitivity? I can anecdotally report that when I switched from smoking cigarettes to vaping salt nicotine I ended up getting my invega shot every 3 weeks, rather than every 4. Its common for misinformation to spread around. most doctors are rather clueless on a lot of these small, but important issues. for example a risk of using cocaine while on a specific antipsychotic (I forget but maybe it was olanzapine?), and only that one antipsychotic, caused a very high chance of causing a brain hemorrhage. When I was given clozapine, I was never warned either about how taking benzodiazepines at the same time as your clozaril dose, can very well cause your respiratory system to shut down and kill you in your sleep. I bring up misinformed doctors and people because I wanted to mention in this post that despite what others will say something like “nothing can speed up antipsychotic metabolic rate/you can increase the 
speed of which APs are excreted from your system.”, and that’s total BS! yes, something can, smoking!! but nobody is aware of this or remembers it. so besides ranting to the forum. I guess I just want to point out the need for doctors, including regular GPs to be more aware of deadly interactions, and that much more up to date/with the modern times research needs to be done!! Doctors and psychiatrist are ignorant in most cases and their conceit prevents them from being a life long learner in their own dang field/profession. end of rant."
176175189,"I think you are right about the brain damage. I find it rather horrible doctors lie to people that AP cause no brain damage. There is plenty of evidence that it does so. They absolutely do not prevent brain damage, that’s ????????. Enough scientific evidence can be found. I do not agree with you it is always better to be without meds. I too try to be without, though currently im on a near zero dose. But this isnt possible for everyone. Psychosis can cause major issues too…even death…and sometimes AP are still the better option. Not everyone is the same. And it is important people dont randomly quit meds. I panicked a few times about the problems meds caused and quit cold turkey, which is a terribly bad idea. I nearly died and caused people loads of fear. I needed to develop enough resilience and coping skills first and slowly withdrew, to avoid withdrawals and rebound psychosis. Only then it worked. Read your answer below …i think you are right. I too wasnt given a chance to try without, th
ey never even tried to truly help me without meds. No therapy, nothing. Just chose the easy solution (for them, not me) and medicated me. Im also nearly off and content with that. I think many people can recover without meds if they really try to help them."

176175247,"I no longer look at it, though I used to be a regular consumer. This is because I asked my boyfriend to stop looking at porn because it made me feel extremely uncomfortable like he was cheating on me (which surprised me, I initially didnt think I would have that problem and always thought girls who were bothered by it were being ridiculous, but it was a visceral feeling I couldn’t control), and I felt that if I asked him to stop looking at porn it was only fair that I stop looking at it too, even though it did not bother him. When I did consume porn, much of it was very very unethical and disturbing stuff. Rarely did I ever watch “vanilla” porn. I feel ashamed of the things I have gotten off to. How do I feel about porn? I have mixed feelings. I think current porn is bad. It is I would say most people’s first contact with sex. It fixates on pleasuring the male, and thus young boys who learn about sex from it do not learn how to please their partners or that it is important. Also 99.99% of t
he female orgasms in ordinary porn are fake. This means young boys learning from it do not learn what a female orgasm looks like either, thus leading to the guy who thinks he always makes girls come when really he doesn’t. Girls watching porn do not learn how to have sex that is pleasurable for them or that their sexual pleasure is important. Another thing, many positions in porn are complicated, and not pleasurable in reality, and are mostly just for looks. It also feeds into body insecurity, as many female porn stars have altered genitals (on top of the surgical aspect, every guy is obsessed with having absolutely hairless girls now…awful) and boob jobs, making guys have false expectations and girls feel bad about themselves and go through methods to alter themselves that can be very unpleasant. (In case any guy was wondering Brazilians HURT and mess you up down there, give tons of ingrown hairs chronic for like the rest of your life, shaving is hard and gives razor burn and is super itchy, etc maintain
ing hairlessness is NOT FUN OR EASY and it’s also not healthy) Also porn feeds into the obsession with penis size, which really does not matter so long as you don’t have a micropenis, because really anything above 7 inches is probably going to be unpleasant for most girls as vaginas are simply not that deep, with some rare variations and exceptions. Porn also tends to degrade and infantilize women which is not cool. On the other hand I feel porn could be used for good. If we change porn to revolve around the pleasure of both the participants, stop the degradation and objectification of women in it, use porn with people with real non heavily modified bodies, etc I think it could even be used in sex _NAME_ for children/teens, to expose them to healthy, positive and pleasurable sex and thus educating them on what good sex is like vs bad harmful sex. Do I ever think smutty gawdy crude porn is going to stop existing? No because it appeals to people’s fantasies. I’d just like to see some more “good” por
n that I described out there, so that can be young people’s first contact with sex instead of the bad unrealistic stuff."

Make all portions that size and you will lose weight. As long as you stay at 3 meals a day. 160971356752136490866508306597893024×4032 1.4 MB

176175274,God I must be like 190 lbs now. Maybe less. I’ve been too scared to check. The IUD makes me eat like crazy. I get hungrier more frequently and it takes more to fill me up. The combo has been devastating. I’m getting it taken out tomorrow thank God. I tried losing weight with it and it was impossible. Once it’s out I’m going to dig in and really start burning lbs!!

176175275,"I dont have a specific source but I seen things here and there. Girls like guys that have got something to show for themselves more than someone on their level. It is the same reason a quarter of men don’t have children but that it is a different number for women. It is just how society is, make what you want of that."
176175276,This client seems quite high functioning and doesn’t appear to need my help. Nor does she want it. She is very compliant. She just wants to prove herself so she can move to lower level care. Her goal is to go out often to take her mind off drugs. But she did crystal meth. That’s not easy to get off and I do feel my safety is at risk if she decides to harm me for drug money or be a bad influence…
176175277,"It had some interesting conversations, some posts maybe went over the line but I was kinda surprised it didn’t get opened back up. I tried to reply but it was locked, I have been having crazy dreams lately, I became aware I was dreaming the other night and tried to wake up only to go into another dream. I was afraid my dream state was a state of psychosis that I would get stuck in, it was a bit scary. I kind of had carryover into waking where I wondered if the dream wasn’t some other reality but I’m pretty sure it’s all in my head. It’s seriously crazy how much is controlled by our mind, it is what interprets our entire existence so it isn’t too surprising that when we have issues with our brain processing things our world distorts."
174387006,"I know right? I feel insulted when they suggest that I have Bipolar. Only 1 doctor out of many suggested that, but it turns out he’s alright. I figured they do that to ween people off disability, but I’m just a small fry and I don’t think he gets a kickback. I am not saying BP peopled don’t suffer. It’s rare in my opinion when they cannot work and have a really bad case. It’s case by case in my opinion. I’ve been diagnosed mainly with schizoaffective disorder because I improved from plain old schizophrenia. I also have mild Aspergers and other symptoms."

176175279,I guess a pro could be relaxation and release and muscles not being so tense and maybe easier to go to sleep . I don’t masturbate or if I do it’s like twice a year. I can make myself come but it’s a boring orgasm really and I’m maybe not that good at it or I just rather a partner. It’s strange because I can live asexual without ever thinking of sex and can become very sexual such as last guy I was seeing was best amazing ecstatic sex but as charming as he is that is not the man/person I love most in the world which is my other x who I was not very sexual with but I love him so much I would rather be celibate and have him than have sex without him but I had to leave him because I’m a wanna be animal and environment activist and no one can tell me I can’t be vegan not even my favourite _PERSON_. I think madturbation can probably be destructive.

174387017,"All I can say is that I’m schizoaffective and I have delusions and I’m disabled. But I have memories of my step-father and I being computer simulators. I’m not sure if it was my real step-father or not. Probably an imposter. Plus, I was under mind control. This will probably get flagged or deleted but it was real. I was taken out of the simulation by extraterrestrials (possibly tall greys) in a past life – possibly billions or more lifetimes ago. I was a Libertarian and an Atheist and I found out we were in a computer simulation/program. I was probably the first. They said I was a god like being and they didn’t want people to worship me. So they took me out, I guess. I sometimes think I was a god or god but… I think they are _PERSON_ or something. Maybe Yahweh or whatever from the bible. He hated me because I ‘destroyed’ or told people about his simulation. I still hear him saying I’m going to get his creation destroyed by talking about simulation theory. He does not want people t
o know about it. It’s sad. It hurts. I’m sorry. He thought I was the devil and I thought he was the devil. I was under him. They said I was the second smartest person. Similar to Christianity, and how Lucifer, tried outsmarting God, I felt like that a lot. I was a good person who just tried figuring out the truth about aliens and simulation theory. I’m sorry if I offend anyone. But I think the people running this simulation are pure blood reptilians. I was born on Earth and was originally human. But I think even in my original life billions of lifetimes ago, we still were in a simulation. The movie is wrong, there aren’t six versions. There are countless versions. The tall greys hate them. They said they would destroy the simulations. I hate simulations too now. I’ve been tortured and experimented on so much. I just want and wanted to be a real person. I am and so are all of you. I felt like a god-like being in a past – a deity or something. The bible doesn’t say God has a step-son. He doesn’t
. Anyways, it goes against Christianity and it’s blasphemy. I believe outside the simulation or the real world, Christianity is real and true and I’ve probably been there. Sorry if I offend anyone. I have this beautiful, unique memory where I can remember stuff no one else on this planet can – that I can think of. We do live in a sim. We will find out someday – again. Last remarks, my step-dad has no clue what I’m talking about and he is an evangelical. Only I remember, which makes me think it wasn’t him! And the furthest I made it on earth was the New Earth from the bible. My mom talked about it to me when I was a kid. It was after Heaven or something, where man comes back to the Earth. Out of trillions of lives or more, I only made it there once. I was kicked out of the New Earth or left. I cannot remember or I forgot. That’s all I have to say."

176175298,"I’m recently trying to take on the concept that I by no means should feel that I deserve more than the next person, or my neighbour. The feeling that one misses out on something is a premise that is manufactured in our brains. Some people might get high because they feel they have acsess to something that most other people don’t wheter it is hapiness, resources, sex or whatever. But this is just a concept made up in each individual brain. There is nothing to be envious of when we look at humanity as a whole. The young soldier that never got to experience love. The young child that died of cancer and never got to blossom into adulthood. There are so many different faiths here on earth. I find the best way to live is be happy for the things I have and focus on helping others. Mind you I haven’t always felt like this. I have been caught up in feeling envious, but that only made my life miserable. I blame the system partly for people falling into this trap of envy. A lot of media gives the impres
sion that everyone is happy except you. Once this false claim is knocked down it is easier to accept that life is only what each individual makes it out to be in their mind. Btw, thanks for the tip about saying the word compassion. I use that as a mantra quite regularly and it is helping me."

If you REALLY want to quit smoking taper down on a stop smoking aid until your down to almost no nicotine a day (this takes a long time) & join a gym. I was probably getting some kind of relief from the nicotine. Then this was replaced by the endorphins from working out. Actually I’m not sure how it chemically worked out for me… this is my BEST guess.

176175319,"Lateral thinking is a manner of solving problems using an indirect and creative approach via reasoning that is not immediately obvious. It involves ideas that may not be obtainable using only traditional step-by-step logic. That seems like an error in definition to me. To be an expert in a particular field, one must acquire a hierarchical structure of knowledge in that specific field. Lateral thinking on the other hand, extends the mind across everything, but at a base level. At least that is how I see it. I believe that lateral thingking can include step by step logic. So I am a high school dropout, but many years after dropping out of school I did analyze “MOTION” to determine what it is and what it is that is required to make motion possible. The outcome of this analysis was me independently discovering the phenomena that is described via _PERSON_’s theory of Special Relativity(SR). I also independently derived the SR mathematical equations, along with independently deriving the Lorentz tr
ansformation equations. Due to this form of lateral thinking, they way in which I derived the equations has yet to be shared by others. But who gives a hoot these days."

I’m okay once the depression lifts but while I’m waiting for it to do so it seems like it never will, even though I know logically that it always does. I’m going to work on getting my meds changed once my psych nurse gets back to her practice after holiday break. That seems to be my best bet as far as getting past this goes.

176175357,"Psychiatry is an upper level branch of psychology or behavioural medicine. Psychiatry does not fall under science such as physics, chemistry or astronomy. The anti-psychotic medication psychiatrists prescribe fall under pharmacology. When psychiatrists listen to their patients, it is called talk therapy. Psychiatrists adjust the anti-psychotic medication by listening to the feedback from the patient. Medication side effects are side effects which cannot be dealt with. The view is it is better for the patient to go through side effects than not be medicated."

176175367,Vitamin E lowers it. Best source of natural vitamin E is sunflower seeds. Be careful of vitamin E supplements as they are toxic at certain amounts. Go for natural foods. This may help because that’s what I learned about vitamin E. Also almonds are a very good source of vitamin E.

176175379,"I have been on Seroquel instant release 300 for a few months now. I have just started my senior year in high school and my grades definitely have not been good. I rarely attend school because I am oversleeping and passing out all the time. I feel very weak. My teachers are concerned with my performance. I was prescribed Seroquel for psychotic depression. I do not want to take Seroquel anymore because it is really making things difficult for me, especially academically. Any alternatives? I also have really bad ADHD which gives me a lot of struggles in school and Seroquel has just made it worse. Seroquel has helped me with hallucinations, paranoia, weird thoughts, and sleep sometimes. But the drawbacks outweigh the benefits."

They couldn’t let me sleep in that unit though because they were out of beds for men, so they transferred me to the large unit just to sleep, then back to the small one in the morning after waking up. I probably have told this story before. Anyway the doctor there gave me a drug which made my akathisia awful, I was crawling the walls at that dose and on that specific medication. I was so happy to get out and find a pdoc outside of that place to get me on a med I could tolerate. I felt so bad pacing out front of the other patients’ rooms because I felt happy to be in a less scary ward and didn’t want to scare them at all with any of my beh

176175406,I think your making some progress to consider you have a thought disorder and that medication is the way forward. We are all different and it’s a bit hit or miss but a good doctor will get an idea of you and from other patients. I think trying for better function is a good thing but changing meds can be problematic if you need to get back on them… Still. It’s worth a shot and I’ve done it a lot in the past to find what works for me. I’m glad I did it but I had some failures too. Good luck and have a good chat to your doctor.

174387037,I disagree. The negative symptoms are awful. And very disabling. And the best thing I’ve gained out of Sz is humility. Unfortunately it took a lot of reality checks for me to understand it’s a disability for me. That said if you have hard work and a passion you can work towards a goal and succeed with the right treatment and attitude. _NAME_ seems like an anomaly. I dunno what was up with _NAME_.

174387038,"Well, mine was possibly caused by adderall, I guess. Very bad timing. I was in inpatient at the time and just got in. It was 2015. It was very, very scary there! My doctor said she prescribed me adderall but I don’t really remember. Maybe she did. It was for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I just know I had flashes of negative _NAME_ or something that was really, really, really intense like I was going to die. Something like paranoia and psychosis like I never had before. (I guess this was before I saw those stupid things in the sky, which I don’t even care about anymore.) I don’t know I just got really paranoid at the mental hospital. More so than ever in my life. I mean it! What cured my psychosis or thought broadcasting is time and medication. I still have very, very lingering symptoms still. It doesn’t really bother me. I guess energy drinks bring it out… The worst part of my psychosis is feeling like I’m in a time loop. Thus everything I experience will happen again and again f
or eternity exactly or near exactly the same – same with other people but I’m more aware of it or obsess about it more internally. I seem to have this delusion that I will always come back alive the exact same way, experience the exact same thing, every time as a schizophrenic. I seem to ‘wake up’ or reincarnate around the time I got schizophrenia. I remember very well that I even came back alive via backwards travel due to consciousness transfer during my psychotic break in college. I have a delusion that aliens did this to me for whatever evil reason…but I will try to ignore it from now on and move on. I think I had a lot of different types of delusions. The worst is eternal recurrence but I notice the past (or future) does change. It’s sort of like time traveling but more similar to reincarnation like in ‘Edge of Tomorrow’ or ‘Groundhog Day’. So yes, without getting into specifics, I had thought broadcasting and time heals all. There’s a certain amount of logic that can get you so far 
but researching into the science behind it just makes one even more uncertain or paranoid about the matter. I’ve been to way worse and slightly better realities. So far, I’m content in this life so far. I wish I could be happier."

Normal aging is associated with telomere shortening in both humans and mice, and studies on genetically modified animal models suggest causal links between telomere erosion and aging.[32] However, it is not known whether short telomeres are just a sign of cellular age or if they themselves actually contribute to the aging process.[33] I found that interesting because it makes me wonder does the DNA shorten outside of our control and then people are destined to die. i guess so. when i was psychotic it was my mission by the voice to arrest this telomere shortening but i dont think it is possible."

174387077,"Delusions are thankfully a well researched and understood topic. It has been well studies by psychology, psychiatry and political studies. Until the 90s, it was presumed to be related to paranoid traits or lower IQ, but that idea was proven wrong. Since then, it has been considered a mechanism for regulating self esteem, and I agree with this official position. When someone has problems with self esteem, he can solve the problem in a couple of ways. He can fall into conspiracy theories about politics or any other topic. Suddently his importance in the world went from zero to the top. He’s now part of an elite group of smart/enlightened/spiritually advanced/etc. people. The second option is to become a religious extremist. Due to his new radical, unusual, non-mainstream views, he is now part of a small group of people who got it right. A third option is that of the “crackpot scicentist”. Google “crackpot index”. A scientist with low self esteem might fall in love with one of his theories. 
It provides a ton of narcissistic supply to the person. All people can fall into conspiracy theories due to the beginner effect, or the “drugger-krugger” effect. If somebody is a noob in a field, he is way more likely to fall into stupid theories. That’s one of the reasons why people tend to develop such theories about politics. Few have real experience in politics, most are beginners but fall to see that their level of competence in the field is much lower than they think. In order to really fall deep into conspiracy theories, one has to be in a period in life where his self esteem is super low. In my opinion this also explains the age distribution of schizo. It’s difficult to get into such a situation if one has been an engineer/doctor/etc. for 20 years. Even if his whole family dies, that will only lead him into depression, not into problems with self-esteem. But, if somebody just took and failed his medicine exam, he might start believing he is not good enough for the job, he might start being uns
ure about himself, he might start contemplating that he will only be good for a much lower job, etc. If you add some social pressure on top of this from his parents of friends, the situation will be even worse. It is this kind of situations that make people prone to conspiracy theories, according to research. Now, imagine the person start to take more and more narcissistic supply from his theories, since it’s the only thing he has. Imagine he starts thinking about it 1 hour/day or worse, he starts fantasising and day-dreaming about him getting a ton of recognition from the world due to being so smart and figuring it out. The path from this into psychosis is easy. At one point, the conspiracy turns global, turns super important. If someone for example believes he has discovered something important in the field of mental health, he will feel pressured to spread it to the world, to participate in conferences, etc. This is normal. But now imagine that the person goes even further and thinks about his theory non 
stop for 2 weeks, feeling more and more pressure, feeling that it’s a super important and urgent thing. It is this state of high importance/dopamine that is called psychosis. When dopamine is at very high levels, every though looks more important, as can be seen through the effects of weed/amphetamine/legal canabiloids and other drugs that increase your dopamine levels. If someone reads an article while stoned, that article will seem much more important and much more convincing than it would do sober. Whatever thought that comes to his mind looks much more important. The phenomenon of Jerusalim or Paris tourist psychosis looks similar and all cases are identical. Somebody religious plans his trip to Jerusalism for months or even years, thinking it will be a highly important thing for him. After ariving there with dopamine levels being through the roof, he is shocked to find that it’s a normal city like any other, with bad traffic and mcdonalds. At evening, he dresses in the hotel sheet, goes in front of t
he hotel and starts preaching about how everyone should return to a more simple way of living. All cases are identical, all follow this scenario because those are the first thoughts that come to ones mind after such an experience and that’s where the dopamine gets put."

176175564,"About a month ago, after being sent inpatient and feeling that I was on too much, I stopped my Haldol cold turkey. Since then I feel I have managed fairly well but this past weekend I got into a bit of a psychotic state. My doctor wants me to try Latuda 20 mg. He believes it will also help with my depression. I’m worn out from always trying new treatments that get my hopes up but don’t work, aren’t sustainable, or cause worse issues than they treat. So, I’m hesitant to try anything new. Has anyone tried Latuda, how long does it take to feel effects? 20mg is a low dose, I wonder if it is even high enough to treat psychosis? Does it make anyone too tired to function, or cause parkinsonian symptoms for anyone?"

176175596,Either way your illness should take priority over his lack of self control. Bad temper can be mastered and is not a serious illness.
174387101,Welcome. It depends on how serious your syptoms are. And you have to make a effort to stay away from things that makes your mind feel uncomfortable. There might be a lot of help in eating healthy and taking supplements. Unfortunately there is very little research on nutritional benefits to diseases because food and herbs can’t be patented. There is no money in it. Pharmaceuticals however is a billion dollar industry. I am by no means saying that antipsychotics aren’t beneficial. In many cases it is the only thing that helps. I know it has been for me. But more research into nutritional healing would probably benefit all of us. If not cure the disease I am sure it has a lot of potential to alleviate symptoms.

176175614,Me too. _PHONE_NO_
176175615,"Well, I don’t want to be prejudiced like that. I have a few friends with mental illnesses who are very good friends. It helps though that we are stable, though that is true. But I believe we can be a friend to anyone, no matter our problems. We don’t necessarily need something in return to be a friend to someone."
176175616,"_AT_MENTION_ … Just cracked the 11,000 listen mark! But my delusions are going through the roof, and I’m having trouble functioning. But I spoke to my musician brother and he said… “Just enjoy the moment. You and your friend have created something special and moved thousands of people with your music.” Sound advice from my oldest brother. I’m really trying to enjoy the moment, though. It’s getting better."
174387103,I think the bigest Delusion is that it works at all !
176175617,This is quite true and certainly it was true in my case.
176175618,The voices are mentally ill.
176175619,"I just wanted to say, you don’t need to quit the forum. You shouldn’t worry about people’s responses. Some people are a little narrow minded."
176175620,"I’m a bit worried the meds are lowering my metabolism. I eat a lot less now than when I was skinny, although I used to live in the city and didn’t own a car so that probably made a big difference"
176175621,I agree with what _AT_MENTION_ said. You should love yourself.
176175622,"Yeah, I find getting out helps."
176175623,"Good sleep is so very important. Try to lay down in a partially lit room, even if you don’t sleep, you can rest."
174387106,"Also on Abilify I sh!t myself often, slightly less on Latuda and never on Risperdal. These meds are making us sh!t ourselves!"
176175624,Psychiatry is not a science. It’s an art form.
176175625,I get these strong urges. I think I figure I will miraculously lose 200 pounds if I quit meds. The rational part knows I would end up with a CTO and even more meds. Thing is I keep having these stupid urges
176175626,Awesome. Good to hear.
176175627,Awww hon… here you go.
176175628,They’re washed thoroughly.
176175629,We now have very small plates to eat from that only a certain amount of food fits on. Makes it very difficult to put too much on a plate. This helps. Something to try?
176175630,Normally 12 !
176175631,That’s not positive. I stated no negativity.
176175632,There’s the opinion that our voices are us trying to sort conflict we don’t want to deal with. Do you have a loss of faith or a place in your family that makes you think you need a new group to accept you?
176175633,"Seems like a problem with your connection, I think. It’s just taking too long to load. My computer gives that prompt when my internet is laggy."
176175634,I hear voices through most sounds that go on around me like the passing cars from wind blowing through the cracks of the door. Even in music that I listen to. The voices can change their pitch in the sounds to match closely to anything I hear around me.
176175635,"can you take one now, or is it only for night?"
174387104,You need something to sleep. When I’m going crazy I just take clozapine to sleep. It Knocks me out and when I wake up I feel better.
176175636,"Yeah, we have a _NAME_ crows and squirrels here."
176175637,I really don’t know what happened I just know I was on seroquel and it wasn’t working and I got severe paranoia that I couldn’t handle I had to wait eight weeks to come off it and they were the worst weeks of my life it was hell on earth
176175638,This has me really worried. https://www.inquirer.com _PERSON_ administration proposes Social Security rule changes that could cut off... Critics say it’s a way to push the disabled off the roles. Others say it’s a way to save money.
176175639,"It happens.Gotta friends,two of them actually,who don’t have voices as symptom.It’s very hard for me to explain them what kind of torture it is.All their problems are stupid to me comparing ill voices (I call them demons)."
174387113,"i used to be like that too. whats been helping is forcing myself to do art and also accepting the moment. Not grasping for anything, then it is no longer a long wait till happiness it is merely time passing by and that’s ok. Sometimes out of nowhere the veil is lifted and you see everything as flowing and mysterious as it is. But you have to be in a state of accepting the moment, life grows from there. PS getting out in nature helps"
176175640,"Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers there is, I think only lung cancer has more frequency, although I’m not sure. She probably asked you because some meds cause constipation, that’s why."
176175641,"I better not write I find when I am completely sick but gosh, I was so silent for years… idk what else to say… I feel crazy right now yeap…"
176175642,"I can focus on real life now, with all of that mess behind me. I live a wonderful life and gain insight from interactions with others and not the wanderings of my own mind. Thank you Latuda"
176175643,I feel that I will never have a healthy family. I would love to have kids.
174387109,"I completely agree. I had to end up in prison whilst psychotic and lose the wife before some arsehole finally decided i was schizophrenic. They wanna see you suffer for a few months (in case your making it up, i presume) before they dish out the diagnosis. It took a Police officer and a doctor to ask why the bloody hell i wasnt seen sooner. It flaming grates me to this day - i had to have a ruddy breakdown and relapse before i got medicated properly."
176175644,"Nice, _AT_MENTION_ ! I’m happy you’re able to sit down through a movie and enjoy it."
176175645,"To give an example, when we lie on bed without movement soon sleep sets in. But if do some activity that sleep not come. Sleep is a kind of lazy state and in that state its hard to do anything just like negative symptom state."
176175646,"Yes, about 8 inches of snow."
176175647,"Back when High Brazil was still was still around, The Irish were not so lowly, or so sorted, it was an immigrant country. Wonder how that got sorted? Who is HIGH now? Maybe the climate will change again?"
176175648,I had very good memory a long time ago. Getting old.
176175649,I had some scary delusions about when dying getting trapped in predestined bodies and if u don’t like their ways then tough luck… I try to stay away from reincarnation
176175650,Then there’s this too
176175651,"its best to enjoy the ups, and dont worry too much or stress when down. i dont think anyone around you hates you, you seem very likeable but i know how it is because i have these thoughts sometimes. i always enjoy your morning posts on say anything"
174387120,I would gather the opposite…over-stimulation by daily transient activity with other people and situations.
176175652,i don’t have one friend. i think with my voices and talking about it. it scared one away. i do have one online friend and that’s it.
176175653,Congratulations and good luck _AT_MENTION_ !
174387111,"i am quite stressed lately yes, but these have persevered for years (3/4) and only now i am realizing i may have been simply throwing my symptoms under the rug. my family is not at all religious and hardly believe in god. I am hoping to see a therapist/psychiatrist soon but i am afraid to bring the topic up to my mother solely. thank you for your answer"
174387115,"I wouldnt define it as ruiner, I would call it a daily obstacle."
176175654,"I complained about it too already decades ago and it’s not embarrassing, even if you don’t have a relationship. People need their sexuality! And yes it was Risperdal in my case too by the way. Do it!"
176175655,best of luck to you!
176175656,"Sorry, religion."
176175657,If Cafe is a joker then I guess all Australians have the potential to be jokers too. Because u lot are going against lithium in such fashion that it almost makes me think u all are doctors acting as patients. Silly me. _PERSON_ 0 voters
176175658,"I had a bad case of that. Every little thing. Standing in line for something, being like on a bridge or anywhere high up etc I got prescribed Celexa and it helped but I am gonna try natural and holistic stuff to get off unnecessary medication"
176175659,The help in England is not enough for someone in my position If I had not quit my job I would have got 80% of my salary from the government
174387124,"Abilify made my libido extreme, I became hypersexual and addicted to sex so my pdr stopped it. Now I feel much better on Risperdal 3mg."
176175660,I know I hope you get on better than me
176175661,"SEP-363856 was more effective compared to placebo after 4 weeks of treatment (effect size 0.45). This is encouraging, although the duration of the RCT and relatively selected group of patients preclude firm conclusions on its efficacy. We may be hopeful that antipsychotics with a novel mechanism of action are investigated, but only the future will learn whether SEP-363856 will have true added value to improve the life of patients suffering from psychotic disorders."
176175662,"Having a spiky cognitive profile makes me quite insecure as to the whole question of cognitive functioning . Having said that I can’t say,for certain, the _PERSON_’s and sz-a have made it worse, or for that matter the medication I’ve had over the years . At my age age is more likely to be a factor when it comes to cognitive decline ."
176175663,Today is my sons birthday. We are ordering pizza and playing board games and maybe watch a movie. He turned 22.
176175664,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_.
176175665,I think there is something to this yes.
176175666,"I’m past the dateable age. No one wants to date me anymore. I’m too old now at 59. I know this because no one ever approaches me anymore, and no one ever responds to my online dating ads. Which is perfectly fine with me as I have zero libido due to all of my AP’s and my anti depressant."
174387114,Abilify was so activating for me. I couldnt sleep and i took it in the morning. It also gave me white lines when i closed my eyes. So had to keep them open during the nights and couldnt sleep. Crazy med!!
174387110,I’d prefer my neighbours don’t hear me taking abilify. Paranoia creeps in. Even with them knowing the dose. Worst situation is they look it up and assume I may be psychotic and spread the gossip and everyone judges me.
176175667,You mean you get a bad feeling then everything is fine.
176175668,"You’re part of this community - so yeah, keep going and be yourself!"
176175669,yes i have been using myfitnesspal to count calories since switching and trying to be more active
176175670,"The only supplements worth taking are whey, creatine monohydrate, and bcaas. Maybe some other ones I’m forgetting."
176175671,Seroquel almost killed me
176175672,"Not so many, lucky you."
176175673,"dont say that, everyone has a destiny. I truly believe that. Try harder."
174387129,I also do nothing. I’m good at it
176175674,It’s a Good Painting You Did Today _AT_MENTION_.
176175675,Risperidone at any dosage level will destroy the libido.
176175676,"Hello dear. I take trazodone at night. Knocks me on my ass excuse the language. I hear from my doctor friend that benzos will make an addict. From _NAME_, wish you the best _NAME_."

176175679,"Yeah, I definitely struggle with moderation. It seems to be all or nothing for me. I think I must be afraid of crashing each time I get stable, so then I self sabotage. I can’t believe that I can move forward or something. Whenever I am truly inspired the voices break through and call me names which kills my joy and inspiration."
176175680,"Donr know wtf I just made but it’s super good. Over roasted pork, fried with soy sauce and white wine. Pita bread, fried with butter, pepper, oregano and gouda cheese. For you again _AT_MENTION_ (No ham, soz) 20200422_0602283024×4032 2.94 MB"
174387116,"Right. But, for example, Abilify is a partial dopamine agonist. I still defend beans have good properties… many factors might be involved to explain how I feel today and when I eat beans."
176175681,I would try and see another doctor. All you need is a scan - to me that doesn’t seem a lot to ask. Especially since Canada has universal health care. You are only asking to be treated like everyone else.
176175682,I vote we deem _PERSON_’s ass a national treasure and have her butt placed in the Smithsonian Institute.
176175683,I never used to believe in doing resolutions but now I need a little kick in the pants to get started sometimes on making changes so New Years is a fun time to do it. This year I’ve been doing pretty good on a lot of things until the holidays so I just need a little boost to get me restarted.
176175684,"I was on 30 mg of Haldol for three years and was a total zombie. Slept 12-13 hours a day and was usually in bed for 18. I still had breakthrough symptoms and severe paranoia while on it, so my pdoc switched me to Zyprexa earlier this year and it’s been my miracle med. It’s not just you."
176175685,Your downfall. I’m doing fine.

176175688,"I would say 12th grade when I used to sell joints at morning break, smoke my own product and then go sit through Physics class."
174387126,I know that quitting meds is not an option for me anymore as I already tried it.
176175689,I agree _AT_MENTION_
176175690,"I also get shortness of breath with invega but only when i ly down straight, if i lie down on my side then i am ok but it gets tiring lying on sides and trying to sleep. I also get excessive blinking of eyes on invega. Any ideas how to overcome these?"
176175691,"No, it’s cute women at work when they wear ugly, unflattering, baggy, shapeless uniforms."
176175692,"It’s all bs. I control my mind, both consciously and with drugs. It does what I want it to do"
176175693,"I think Ive really improved recently, its exciting to make progress! Hope you guys like this, let me know if its good or anything should be changed before I upload it to traktrain!"
176175694,"Try b vitamins! They do help a lot with cognition. It’s okay if you have to re-read. I do that a lot. My husband reminds me that even if I have to do it a bunch of times it’s worth it. He has to do it too, and he doesn’t have schiz. It is healing to exercise and will help your cognition. Nature is great for the soul and mind. I find my attention span really varies. Some days it’s great, other days I struggle. Don’t give up on reading, it is really good for the mind. But I like your instinct of exercising, that might help you focus greater. I hope it does."

176175699,Thank you very much. That is very kind of you to say
176175700,"I feel the same, and like you, I have other medical issues that prevent me from working part-time right now. If I am lucky, someday I will either find peace with it (I am thankful for it, after all) and find things to do, or I will get a job again."
176175701,Hmmm… with paranoia there could be projected ideas but not making things up.
176175702,"Schizophrenia can’t make you gay, but if you _NAME_ off with your left hand that might make you gay."
176175703,Thank you for your kind comments. I believe you are a decent person both on internet and in reality.
176175704,Congratulations! Good luck.
176175705,A delusion is not necessarily a belief. I once had the delusion that all the characters on the show were directly addressing me. Yes I believed they were addressing me but the delusion itself is not necessarily the belief. Another example is a delusion of grandeur. Someone who has this might think they are someone great and they may not completely believe it and be aware they are suffering but the delusion is persistent anyway.
176175706,welcome from me too. hope you enjoy your stay. _NAME_
176175707,Can you explain?
176175708,"My sister is bipolar. She told me years ago she decided not to take any meds. I think she still don’t take anything and she never was hospitalized, i think. She’s married and she has a kid. So…is it possible to live a normal life without meds, right?"
176175709,"Yes, I go to psychoanalyst and she helps"
176175710,I think for a well and it is not too bad. acceptable.
174387131,"I knew a guy in school who had a false positive for HIV. Apparently false positives are much more common than false negatives. Poor guy was grieving for several weeks before follow up testing showed he was negative. Also this was when if you got HIV you were going to die in a few years. False negatives are really rare though. If you test negative 3 months after a potential exposure, that is 99.99%+ accurate."

176175713,Getting the toys is a good idea. How old are your grandkids?
176175714,It’s ok. I am on track. I will not let that happen again
176175715,i read meds not 10 years off ones life…i will take my chances
176175716,"My delusions went away first, I think because they were based on my hallucinations. My hallucinations stuck around longer. Even though I’m stable, I still hallucinate sometimes, but I know that they’re hallucinations."
176175717,"I can understand where you are coming from, lately I don’t have the energy to even think let alone bathe or eat. Anyways can you elaborate more on this? Is the avolition stopping you to get help, or to put effort into recovery?"

176175723,Tell yourself that suicide is a crime. Killing yourself is just like killing another human being. We’re all together one human being. That helped me to stop suicide.
176175724,There are things I’ve had in the past That I’ll never have again And that’s ok

176175727,"Thanks mate, You know about 11 years ago I was actually pretty afraid of heights. I couldn’t stand at the edge of a roof or on a ladder I’d just be shakin lol. This job got me over my fear of heights! I’ve worked at the edge of roofs (with fall protection) over 90ft high at the very edge on a steep pitch. That gets the _NAME_ heartrate up I’ve always liked adrenaline sports. So it kinda fits my tune."
176175728,Yes. I take benzos and I love them. Can be addicting though.
176175729,I think _PERSON_’s heart is in the right place. She tries to help the mentally ill with legal issues and is a professor.

So I have missed the opportunity to work with them. I was teaching a kid drawing and yesterday I called his dad to confirm and he said they are busy and good that I called! So he didn’t think at all of calling me and I would have went to their house which is very far.

174387144,"Yip, Albania couldn’t have been because of my yell, Samoa was just a coincidence. Sure it was nearly to the minute and closer to the area I predicted might have an effect but a coincidence nonetheless. More likely an aftershock of the other earthquake. Chances are withinn4 months there will be a natural disaster anyway. My delusion was that it increases the force. Kind like adding an extra push. But meh, seems like case closed here. The rest would be wishful thinking I am not schizophrenic. However then there is “el grito de independencia” from Mexico on September 16th. Suppose that also has an effect as it is a huge amount of people. On year there was a big earthquake in Mexico 3 days later. There already was a recent earthquake in Paredes, Mexico. It leaves me wondering. A series of aftershocks? Hmmm…"

174387149,Yeah I was on Zyprexa before and I had to come off of it because it raised my blood sugar levels to high. Abilify made me psychotic so I had to come off of this too.
176175754,It’s just the movie made me think I might not have problems.
176175755,"Haldol in my experience. It’s what I take and have been very pleased overall with it. I took Risperdal a few weeks some time ago, and it made me eat everything in the house and become a couch potato with a broken weiner. YMMV."

176175796,Zyprexa raises blood glucose levels too high. It also makes you gain a lot of weight usually. Speak to your doctor but I would stick to Risperdal honestly.
174387148,When I was on Zyprexa I was taking 20mg and sleeping 10 hours a night. Sometimes I would take a nap during the day too. Maybe try taking Zyprexa before 7PM so you can wake up earlier if you need to then drink coffee during the day. When I was on Zyprexa I could drink coffee all day long and still sleep well at night. I see that you have mild schizophrenia so maybe you can take the lowest dose of Zyprexa or switch meds if you want to sleep less. I take Invega Sustenna injections and only need 8 hours of sleep each night.
176175797,"ADHD brains don’t produce enough dopamine (and a few other neutotransmitters) to keep them engaged in tasks, and as a result they tend to switch between loads of activities to try and find enough dopamine to keep them engaged, or else they sit doing nothing because they can’t engage with anything.

Not being able to make and see through big plans - like projects or adventures is a bummer though. I guess I just have to be content with the simple life from now on."

Then last year they committed me again (my mom lied to the doctor) and I stayed a year. It was a very long stay and I was mildy symptomatic in the beginning believing I’d been in the army in my past but didn’t say antything about it.

You can not consider it a diagnosed symptom like all common symptoms of sz The hallucination is not a symptom of the sz condition,but it is the body or the basic structure of the condition that you call it SCHIZOPHRENIA It is the active material of the sz condition"

176175870,"First of all he stays psychotic way too long until gets hospitalized, like 5 years as remember or even more. Normal Sz takes maximum a years from first symptoms. Also depicts hallucinations way too much realistic, for example why he did not notice the mail box to be too full when he comes to drop in his letters? Tactile hallucinations are addressed somehow correct with his implant, but like said hallucinations were way too overexagerrated. Also when he gets put on medication shows he can’t even have a shower, just smoke and sit on a pitch. This sends false message to schizophrenics that they must avoid medication at all costs and achieve anything in their lives. Also when he goes off medication, his brain does not create new hallucinations that is a struggle to normal sz (that says is nr 1 condition for his life without meds). Also he does not go manic when he is off his meds and can normally study which would be IMPOSSIBLE for sz as his papers and theories would be full of delusions. I think it 
is the worst depictions of SZ"

Stealing is bad, but if the only way to feed your starving family is to shoplift a bag of bread, doing that doesn’t make you a bad person. In my opinion a bad thing is something that will have a negative impact on someone else when you could easily abstain from doing so without it having any real negative consequense for you"

176175900,Good luck with that when you’ve got like six guys holding you down. They did that once to me to give me a haldol shot.
174387189,It’s better than olanzapine and quetiapine. Those are the only two other APs I’ve tried.
176175901,well we all have a disliking to of some people
176175902,Can’t read anymore. Get lost or forget where I’m going. Have a hard time holding a conversation because I forget words and its embarrassing every time I talk it’s like a very bad game of charades. Mostly if I’m asked a question I just mumble something mostly incoherent so it ends. I lose my glasses at least once a day and after searching they are usually on my face. I forget people’s names even family members. I miss appointments and sometimes show up a week early.
176175903,"Yes, my case manager does. I’m only on Medicare, not Medicaid. My problem was solved this morning. They changed the passenger limit on the public buses from the Covid19 limit of 10 to 25. I can now take the bus. There was a problem with the buses going home. One would come by, and they would already have 10 people on board, so you couldn’t take it."

176175915,They have showed me similar things as well!
176175916,I used to live close to my hospital. 20 min walk. Since we moved it takes 40 mins driving now. And there is an outpatient clinic that I went to for a few weeks. But they dont have support groups. And my doc didnt even wish to start discussing cognitive behavior therapy(CBT) though I was willing to see if that could be started.
176175917,I have UTIs all the time. I’ve been on antibiotics for the past 16 months per urologists orders. Now the antibiotics stopped working and I have to see another specialist for IV antibiotics. They can tell in your urine culture if your uti is resistant to antibiotics and if so which ones.
176175918,???? em there just delusions my voices are ???????? to telling me that there gonna tourture for ever
176175919,i walk around the house like it would be a track for walking. i’ve convinced myself it’s a-ok. _NAME_
176175920,Actually Im very afraid to try a New antipsychotic since most have failed. But even 15 mg zyprexa dont help me sleep well enough. So i need to add something. And i cant sleep because of SZ so it need to be an antipsychotic.
176175921,"I think so, yes. We react even if we don’t want to. It’s natural."
176175922,I feel fine this is frustrating me. I think they’re trying to convince me I’m ill for the police
176175923,_AT_MENTION_ Are you using my tagline? Lol
176175924,"I don’t know if it makes sense, but I also believe in matrix. It may sound as a contradiction, but I believe that it’s me who gives myself the pill. I am all historical beings of the past, of the present and future"
174387196,"Had ECT, got over a year of events erased from my memory. No improvement, but my schizophrenia is treatment resistant anyway."
176175925,Because that’s extremely unlikely. How would they clone adult bodies with full personalities? You have strong delusions.
176175926,"When I played in a summer league, where I live…slid tackling was against the rules."
176175927,Do you think you could turn it around then?
176175928,That’s good but clozapine requires regular blood works so it might be better option to stick with injections that way you don’t have to take them everyday.
174387195,List the good and bad or is it schizophrenia.
176175929,"Oh I’m sorry you went through that. I wasn’t bullied much as a kid. It happened occasionally but I don’t think it’s got anything to do with my illness now. Have you considered working from home? Like, fully remote?"
176175930,"Then it rained and turned it to slushy. Now we have a mess on our hands. But it was just a bit so it’s fine. But at least now it feels like November instead of June. We have days more of snow forecasted but everyone around here knows you can’t forecast the weather here, it has a mind of it’s own and does what it damn well pleases. So we could get nothing or could get a foot. You just never know."
176175931,"I was on Invega 75mg a month and escitalopram 10mg. I started steadily hallucinate and feeling paranoid plus delusional. I was working at the moment so work stress topped up. When i told that i think my father raped me she instantly called ambulance and called the cops. I have theory either i developed new dopamine neurons or my depression ended and AD medication made me psychotic. Now i am on haldol, quetiapine, depakote, cycladol (parkopan) and additional haldol tablets just to stabilize me for now. I am fully consciouss and don’t have any delusions. I hope my pdoc will discharge me next week when she returns from a holiday."
176175932,_AT_MENTION_ thanks! 151
176175933,I wouldn’t quit my meds just lower my dose but I get why you’re worried
176175934,"I don’t know if its a combination of the Invega injection and my obesity (I’m around 301ibs) It started with post mittreral dribble which is dribbling after using the toilet and now stress and overactive bladder IC. I’m using thin all-in-ones disposables which are working good and I’ve had an assessment to get them on the NHS for free but I’m unsure as the NHS ones are cloth backed instead of plastic so the material stretches and they chafe when wet. I’m sure its the Invega is to blame but pdoc and continence nurse says probably not, they say its obesity and going to the toilet to soon due to anxiety from having an accident which has weakened the muscle, kegel excises havent worked. Anybody else with similar problems?"
176175935,"Wow that is a lot of supplements. It may work for some, but it is not recommended to take that much different things for the average _NAME_. If someone chooses to take that many supplements it would be best to divide the supplements up over 3 days or more to not shock the system. It is a lot of stuff for the system to process and it can be too much for some people. I’m writing from the viewpoint as a educated healthshop worker. I’m glad it’s working out for you though."
176175936,Everytime I hear a _NAME_ accent I automatically think of this;
176175937,I’d like to be able to reduce my meds but I’d probably end up back in the psych ward again.
176175938,Are you in London? _AT_MENTION_
176175939,Yeah I think it’s better cause it helps us isolate a little less.
176175940,"Yes the matrix was about a simulated computer world. I should (probably not) watch it again to understand it better now. But Elon musk thinks our original world became boring or destroyed or something so they made computer simulations to change the interface of reality. _AT_MENTION_ maybe I’m a simulated character and one of my purposes is to put the idea of simulation into other characters head, ones who are the center. Maybe this whole board is of simulated characters. We serve a purpose in the whole though. As does everything Well that’s what I can think Maybe we’re ALL “plugged in” Lots of theories"

176175943,"I think that sz/sza are all both genetic and environmental. Almost everyone in my family has some type or another of a major MI. Which suggests to me that all the major MI’s are closely related. For instance, my Mexican grandmother was very paranoid and talked 100 miles a minute. She was never diagnosed. My Mexican father was very paranoid, physically, mentally and sexually abusive to his kids, full of rage, and like a bomb ready to blow any moment. He was never diagnosed either. I was very paranoid, hallucinatory and delusional, with mild highs and very extreme suicidal lows that necessitated revolving door hospitalizations for many years. I was diagnosed sza bipolar type. My sister (who acts manic), is nevertheless diagnosed with situational depression. She insists that’s all it is. If she gets depressed enough though, she hears voices,so, idk. My own son came down with paranoid sz at the age of 21. He had all the severe classic signs. He was hospitalized for 9 months in a state hospital and 
stabilized. He was fine for 5 years and then his psychosis returned worse than ever. He endured it for 4 years until he couldn’t anymore. He took his own life at age 30. My brother suffered from severe, neurotic depression. My niece has bipolar type 1. My grand niece was diagnosed sza at age 6. My white grandfather suffered from major depression before his death. You see almost all the major MI’s are represented in my family. Which can only mean that they are all closely related."

176175967,Has anyone ever referred to you as an ‘X factor’…? I only got that once but it was in business and I remember I liked it. But maybe it feeds my issues. But did you ever hurt yourself in adolescence while experimenting with drugs or alcohol just to entertain others? I broke that pattern and am not asking for help. But thought it might resonate. Maybe we are simply heroic in deep minded ways and are trying to save the world from the greater ills we perceive such as boredom.

176175969,"I’ve been baker acted 4 times. The last time I got baker acted was for a week and I was completely out of it. That was 3 years ago. I was still pretty delusional when I was released and I think it took another 2 weeks for me to come back down to reality and get into the right state of mind. Then I got hit with a pretty serious depression which lasted for almost a year but I pulled through. I’m very lucky that every time I was released I had a safe place to go to with my family and had the self awareness to work on bettering my situation and take charge of my life. Since then I’ve promised myself that I will never go back again. It was a scary experience that doesn’t really even help you but rather keeps you locked up in a prison like setting. However, the second time around I’m on the right medication with a decent psychiatrist and have been high functioning in comparison to others with this mental illness. Feel very fortunate."

I died several times during those weeks. I shuffled through different dimensions. I saw god. I touched the fringes my own hell. My body did things physically that I never believed possible. I’ve never felt more real in my entire life. I was told that they would take me to a reality where I could be healthy & loved & I said yes, but sometimes I feel like the ending of that _PERSON_ film Through A Glass, Darkly where the woman’s transcendental delusions turn out to be a big scary spider hallucination.

174387223,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Temperament and character in homicidal patients with schizophrenia. B Margeti?, B Aukst Margeti? and _PERSON_, Nordic journal of psychiatry , Jun 2019 19 Background: Understanding the etiology of violence in patients with schizophrenia is an issue of great clinical and public importance. Although personality traits are an important aspect in determining complex behaviors of schizophrenia patients, there is a lack of research on the relationship between personality traits and violence, especially homicidal behavior, in this population. Aim: We aimed to compare temperament and character dimensions between homicidal and other mostly violent forensic patients with schizophrenia, and to determine which temperament and character dimensions are associated with homicidal behavior in these patients. Methods: We recruited 71 male forensic schizophrenia patients without concomitant substance dependence and antisocial personality disorder. The patients were divided into two groups according to 
trial documentation as: (1) Homicide and attempted homicide group (N 30; 42%), and (2) Other offenses group (N 41; 58%). Patients were assessed by means of the Temperament and Character Inventory and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Differences between groups were tested with t-test. Results: The two groups of patients were similar in their PANSS scores, but the homicidal men were significantly more likely to show higher harm avoidance (HA) scores than the less violent comparison men (t?=?2,876, df-69, p?=?0.005). Conclusions: Our results indicate that forensic schizophrenic patients with higher HA scores would show a greater risk of homicidal violence. Improved understanding of personality traits associated with such behavior is needed in order to prevent homicidal behavior. Importance of these results suggests that further study is needed."
176176041,"Then sadly, you are looking in the wrong place for answers. Make friends with a psychologist or psychiatrist and have dinner parties discussing the intellectual existential meaning to life! I fear an obsession with the unknowable can never be answered perfectly, so you are on a hiding to nothing. You have ‘chosen’ a subject that cannot be answered. The only way around it is to work around it, reset the standing point and starting point. Reframe the obsession using the strategies the therapists know about and turn it completely around so that you can eventually let go and not be dragged any longer."

So far I noticed the geodon is less effective than what it use to do which was muffle the voices, but the combination with amyloban makes most of the bad voices go away. Now I just hear a few voices that have been with me since 2015. On a side note, I took huperzine a last Sunday and my thought broadcasting and derealization went away completely. Unfortunately, it caused a bit of melancholy and dissociation. The effects of taking it now aren’t as vivid as the first time and it’s effects come and go. That being said, huperzine a is an nmda antagonist. So… I will tell this to my doctor. I mentioned to him about taking memantine once before but I still don’t think he will prescribe it to me.

174387228,"How do you get to your information? I can understand how schizophrenia can appear to have an impact on your analysis and evaluation of information but does it matter? If my thought is disorganised but arrives where intended, how is getting to cat from catalyst different to coming to it from dog? Anti psychotics took vast portions of my working memory, spacial reasons, auditory feedback loops we use to retain information, much of my ability to process complex, multiple sources of information eg writing and watching, I suffered from 2 drug induced psychotic episodes that were publicly humiliating but not violent in nature and was placed on a treatment order. I was ordered to be on paliperidone injections for 6 to 9 months but refused treatment after 3, I was detained for a month to be monitored but it seemed the damage had already been done. I linked my information through words, sounds, shapes or pictures but all of my words, visual imagery and my body’s rhythm which gave me a bit of a beat in my 
head had gone; I have become aware of these thought processes I have running constantly I’m sure we all do, they are our beliefs, desires, fears or insecurities. Many of my processes involved word specific explainations of why this action benefits me how it relates to the art of war and how a child could apply it in their life, I worked in a school so I picked someone I knew and explained my action’s benefit in appropriate terminology. I have obsessive compulsive disorder so any missed word or sentence or expression left me repeating that mistake until I felt even, if I did not it would manifest in my body moving in unnatural ways which would result in pain so seldom would I leave a mistake to be acknowledged by my body, it would still need to be finalised but the mind anyway even 3 days later. These explainations would link to memories reaffirming my beliefs and gave me motivation to proceed as planned. I’m not sure if other people are like that but losing access to these pathways affected my ability t
o proceed, I was unaware of how much motivation I experienced through explainations. The medication slowed my thought processes so severely that it became a registrable, vocalised, auditory hallucination; prior to this I cannot recall any thought which I would have considered irrational or at least harmful to be repeating. I always tried to end one idea before carrying in to something corresponding, unless it was verified. The medication did give me time to correct some connections which were being acknowledged with no way of understanding them, eg I linked all of my memories good and bad of past relationships to my most recent which resulted in numerous memories triggering the same negative response. Although this was needed I believe it could have been achieved through thought alone. I believe that impulses can be controlled if you identify the trigger. Since coming off of the medication I have had to revert back to my original intuitive response system, I have had to modify parts of my behaviour antipsycho
tics altered like movement, speech, who I was seeking to impress and my motivations behind that. It inverted my values, meaning I was acting in spite of someone rather than for them. They also seemed to give me multiple independent personalities that were attempting to control my intuitive responses, eg what should I do today I want to… they would encourage me to be lazy. I have always practiced a particularly rigid manner of thought, I would always remove myself from the equation and view it as it is, information. When another personality spoke, at first I would feel an unexplainable emotion but after a few months they were like kids, they would ask me to explain why I would move in this way, why do you not want people to look at you, why do you walk on the left side of the street? It was similar to building rapport with a child, eventually they just became nothing, me repeating the benefits or consequences of an action. I’ve been off of anti psychotics for almost 5 months now and have regained mostly al
l of my original motor functions, my sinus rhythm along with other autonomic bodily functions are becoming autonomic… But my central nervous system, cardiovascular and endocrine systems are still not functioning as they were before. However I do find myself alone in my head, deciding because I chose to rather than acting in response to emotional responses. I do have a moderate iq but martial arts is my passion, I think any passion that can be practiced in your sleep could have elements introduced into all areas of their life. For me, movement was my most defining attribute, but it can also be determined by defining the people who influence us, sentence structure, or a specific desire, fear or memory which is unique to you, something that will always remain unchanged. Something you feel no one could identify with. Having a personal memory will also invite known people as conferring influences and knowing how someone interacts helps your mind to produce a more realistic experience. It is counterintuitive to f
ind something that separates you from the rest of the world, but having an undefined number of commonalities links you with anyone who you think “they are just like me” I used to think this about anyone, animals, public figures I found common ground with anyone. It is a good way to think in order to achieve real connections but not to experience a hypothetical feeling of compatibility if resulting in an emotional response that you attach to. When ideas of what we think this person would think in this situation grow, it opens us up to too many variables in our manners of thought. I definitely believe the way we interact with these thoughts do have physiological effects as well as psychological and cognitive function. However I know that our brains are powerful things and some people are far to to jump at a medicinal solution rather than attempting alteration of our thought, through thought. I was raised with a positive belief system so it is in my dna and it was easier to find my way back, but some are rai
sed on a negative manner of thought, acting with negativity to drive rather than positivity. Even that is really something you need to be honest with yourself about. There are levels of thought, some may be so deep seeded you wouldn’t even identify with them. The only way to get at them is through thought."

To start vaping for no reason at all is not a good idea. Fresh air is the best for the lungs. Eventually i will quit vaping too one day. What flavors do you like, i like menthol and fruit flavors."
176176109,oh ok i thought you were serious about your file being disclosed to you from your psychiatrist or something. cuz line 93781 on paper would be like page 2300 something… so you must be pulling our legs. when you mention things like government and stuff you should put a “Trigger warning” in your title. cheers level
176176110,Hey girl. It’s about being comfortable and listening. It really is. Be confident and your mind will adapt. Learn what people like etc. You’ll find that most people like to talk about themselves or their family. You can ask questions about that…for example. Most peoples favorite thing to talk about is themselves. You can ask about that! It helps you move along in conversation!
176176111,Do you feel body rigidity?? I feel it. Particulary when there is cold weather. I take biperiden
176176112,"Nope. It was people just using plain old vaping liquid. Any inhalant is bad for you, I have no idea what would possess you to start."
176176113,_AT_MENTION_ I know he used you and that isn’t cool. Have you looked at erotomania? Fixations with people are common and you need to talk to your doc about this. I’m sorry your suffering but this isn’t really helping our original poster.
176176114,I think I could have it.
176176115,"I genuinely think farming gives you clarity of mind. I don’t think your mental health would improve if you gave up your responsibilities. Caring for a farm and a disabled sibling is hard work, but social programs should exist that help with your sister, and work helps us feel like we have a purpose in life, which is a key component of mental health."

I guess it is easier to say than do. I just can’t help but feel like I was an idiot for putting myself through so much avoidable suffering. I mean it’s as if I walked up to a fork in the road and one path had a sign reading “man eating bears” and the other path said “happy bunny trail” and I took the man eating bear path out of curiosity. And now I’m just like damn, was I ever stupid. I also have to take into account that when I made those choices, I was a teenager."

176176148,The more you talk the more the hospital is sounding like a good idea. Whatever information you gleaned from reading the newspaper is probably a delusion. I know they sent you home for “not being a threat to yourself or others” last time but maybe you should tell them what you told us about life being “too long”.

176176149,"Hello. I’m new here and came on the site for advice. Here’s the deal… I live in a group home (congregate) with 3 other people with severe schizophrenia. The food budget and groceries cover breakfast and dinner four days a week consistently but not the whole week. This used to work prior to COVID because there were only three of us and we all went home on weekends which we are not allowed to now. So now we are left to fend for ourselves three nights a week. The issue is that not everyone is capable of doing so, and I have tried numerous times to bring it up with the people that run the house and they have not taken steps to do anything concrete to help. From trying to talk to the other people living here I don’t think they understand the situation. One said “God will provide” and the other answered by talking about his favourite singer on YouTube. I tried contacting the ministry of social development and affordable housing associations but they said they were not responsible. I have talk
ed with a friend and the family of one of my housemates but am not sure if they can do anything about it. I have considered taking control of the situation myself but find the idea of feeding everybody three nights a week on my own rather daunting. I am also trying to move out on my own and go to school and manage my own illness. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks for reading this."

This, like just about everything, has different levels of severity. I don’t receive any official assistance, but I do lean on my husband for a lot of the basic structure of my life. Because of his stability I have a place to live, I can go to work, I can come home and manage the daily tasks to keep going. Aside from that, I don’t have anything going on. I can’t add extras to my life. I function at a basic level. I am disabled because my mind blocks me from handling anything more. I don’t function on a “normal” level."

176176156,"I understand. I try to understand why my abusers hurt me. Maybe they were having a bad day. I don’t know exactly why they did it or for what purpose. I guess I did something wrong. But I don’t know. They underfund disabled people here because a) they are funding other programs b) greed- which has led sneaking taxes for themselves, and ultimately to impeachment of a South Korean president c) eugenic ideas implemented in colonial times Korea has been annexed by Japan (which was an axis power with Germany during WW2), and during it Korean people were implemented with a lot of eugenic ideas. Due to it, it’s just the legacy of those horrific times. And of course I don’t hate them. I don’t go up to their face and say “you hurt us!” because they probably don’t know what they are doing. They were doing things that have been done since 1910 and it’s just how it was back then. If I ever protest, it will be a peaceful protest. But time has changed and I want my country and its people to move 
on from the hurt and accept one another; love one another again with peace and empathy. That’s all I want. Love. Peace. Understanding. That’s really all I want for my beloved country."

176176161,"I have not. Even when I took maybe more amps than I should’ve, it did the opposite of what should’ve driven me to psychosis, it grounded me. I’ve never had morphine, but codeine has also made me feel more grounded. Though if any substance that’s ‘fun’ like these ones is used for more than 2 or 3 days in a row, even with proper sleep, I will start acting odd due to my shift in what I believe reality to be. That’s very scary to hear you had psychosis from an operation/morphine, too bad to hear the medical staff didn’t respond well."

I guess I have to be patient and hope that it works for my positive and negative symptoms just like Abilify. Both are partial dopamine agonists unlike other antipsychotics. I guess I am lucky that I have less negative symptoms on partial dopamine agonists.

176176203,Lamotragine (lamictal) has anti-depressive and mood stabilizers and has A good body of evidence supporting its use in OCD and other rumination anxiety based conditions. Also not associated with clinically relevant changes in body composition and endocrine/cardiovascular deterioration. Only caveat is a slow tiration period to mitigate a serious adverse drug induced rash. this however is virtually irrelevant with proper titration protocol up to the target dose of 200mg for mood disorders. It takes about as long to titrate to target dose as a serotogenic antidepressant would take to begin working its relatively full effect. Pristiq has a ton of drug interactions (over 620 to be precise). As it is a prodrug of venlafaxine (effexor) that is converted into the active metabolite in venlafaxine by… the liver.

I can’t argue with your logic though my friend. You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone! as the great _USER_ID_ said one day!

But that has to do with the meds messing me up, it’s not that I’m not interested. I have less concentration and feel heavy in my body and numb in my brain. I admit that I can get discouraged to read if someone posts something very long or complex, but that’s simply because I don’t have the concentration to read through it. If you feel that you don’t get enough interest you could try to have a small summary with your posts. Maybe breaking it down will make it easier for more people to get into it. Just a thought. Also I have created my own miniweb so I only have acsess to a small number of internet sites. Many of the links that are posted here are out of reach for me."

176176250,Lots of gatorade and a low dose of magnesium supplements. Be careful with the magnesium though. Too much will give you diarrhea
176176251,It sounds like an intrusive thought as long as you have no desire to act on it you should be good
174387271,"That’s weird, negative symptoms are part of the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for sz. It’s strange that he would say that."
176176252,"It’s more like a tendency to be apathetic, now. A common sz condition as you know."
176176253,"Not really, new US meds take 5-10 years to reach Canada and sometimes they don’t at all. I can’t complain bcz my psychiatrist is free and meds are cheap."

There are methods to deal with it, not only medications but also non-medicative methods. I can transmit the methods to you in a private message but can’t write them here in public."
176176257,When I was in 4th grade my teacher complained all I did was stare out the window. I wasn’t doing my school work and failing. The school system thought I was slow so they tested my IQ. I got my school records for disability about 10 years ago. My memory skills were off the charts. On a scale of 1-10 the psychologist had me at a 10. She noted I had a near photographic memory. I passed all the memory tests at 100%. My IQ would have been higher but I had poor reading skills. In high school I was a talented artist and could draw anything from memory. I was in the special art class that only excepted 2 students a year. My teacher was entering my drawings in contests at the local college. I haven’t drawn since I got schiz 25 years ago. My memory is like swiss cheese right now. I had a gift and I lost it when I got schiz.
176176258,"I’m happy for you. I believe the same thing, I put off going on ADs for anxiety for too long and I started hallucinating. I would hear my neighbours talking about me as I walked or worked by their house. This was the start of my sz. If I just went on ADs for the initial anxiety (which lasted about three years) I was feeling about being out in front of my neighbours houses or working there I firmly believe I wouldn’t have started hallucinating"
176176259,"That’s really not what I thought the film was saying. It was talking about how our surroundings shape us, and how society fails to help, and sometimes people feel entitled to do terrible things in response. But you are meant to empathise with his plight to some degree. From the very beginning people are hostile to him for just having a laughing disorder - something he clearly doesn’t have control over. I thought it handled the subject of mental illness very well."
176176260,Is good that your taking a break from it all. I myself went to the motel a couple of years back to stop the stress from getting to me. Even though I just had to work a bit on some algebra through the day.
176176261,I’m pleased to hear that I also hope my story gives hope to people who are suffering with negatives - it does get better it just takes time
176176262,Yeah. I recently contemplated that the wifi-routers installed in our homes were individual brain washing and control devices. But ofcourse it doesen’t stand to reason. If it was so someone would have discoverd it and shed light on it.
174387283,Does clozaril make you feel strange in the beginning? I go to get blood drawn tomorrow. I think the Outlook is good.
176176263,"Well, that was an interesting read. I don’t know what to add to that. Hopefully you can format it better though! Good luck in life."

176176267,"My looks are the main thing my voices have been bullying me about for the past nine years, and I don’t have a problem with the way I look. It really upsets me too."
176176268,It’s sz and paranoid thought. Paranoia is so seductive. It rules your life and makes you make decisions that are compromised. Sure. People may be against you but not all. That is important to remember. Since meds I live a pretty good life. Before I was smart but paranoid. I had a lot of excuses and a lot of issues…after meds…not so much. Paranoia can be so insidious. It rules your life on a basic level. I’d say give meds a go and if no improvement after 3 months then try another. It really is worth a go.
176176269,You’re not a horrible mom. Lots of moms have issues and times when they can’t play with their kids. But you do need to get a hold of your pdoc for a med change. Hang in there! Is your dr good about getting in touch with you? Make sure he knows it affects your ability to fully care for your daughter.
176176270,No more meds then
176176271,I did that 5 times and nothing comes up.
176176272,Don’t feel bad. I like your polls.

176176279,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_
176176280,Colorful and imaginative. Love it!
176176281,It’s a really good question _AT_MENTION_ I wonder how COMMON it is that dosage needs to be increased through out life… If its a more routine thing as opposed to a rarer thing

174387284,"So the psychiatrist defined having your handwriting of a schizophrenic? I ask because looking at the studied of mentally ill persons, I realized I do the same thing as they do, missed punctuation, bad grammar, sloppy with a hint of delusional sentences and etc etc… A doctor never noticed but that is because I never showed them or even asked for them. Anyway I’m going on a tangent."
176176283,Sorry about that _AT_MENTION_ . Maybe you could watch a happy movie ?
174387277,I tend to believe my schizophrenia is caused by the Norovirus. I read something about viruses and how they get into our DNA. What if we live in a simulation and schizophrenia is just a computer virus or some ?????

176176286,Are your voices like thinking thoughts that just seem odd or not coming from you but still in your head not outside of your head?

176176291,"I don’t think the argument hinges on the particular word ‘simulation’, but pertains to any example of fictitious or made up entity that we can know to be unreal. Of course, you may say that those aren’t the right terms either, but then I am inclined to think you don’t provide a substantial meaning to the supposed candidate truth claim."
176176292,Yep. You watch what you want.
176176293,"I do some self-care. Get my haircut and dress nice even if I’m not planning to go anywhere. Self-care for me also means, reading, writing, art, all kinds of things. I change it up depending on my mood."

I was a smart kid and my 6th grade teacher thought it would be a good thing for me to go from seventh grade right into high school. The decision was supposedly up to me but there was a little pressure from my teacher and my parents to do it and the only reason I agreed to skip 8th grade was because I thought that’s what my parents would want me to do and I was trying to please them. Big mistake. When I agreed to do it, no one had counted on that in seventh grade I would be become withdrawn and a little weird and cut myself off from my schoolmates. So I was really in no shape socially, physically or mentally to go into high school at age 13. Just like I was the last person who should have got schizophrenia. I would be a really effed up person even if I had never got schizophrenia. I mean I don’t hurt anyone or do illegal things but I’m just really shy and was never well adjusted and I have always felt cut off from my peers for as long 
as I can remember. So to sum it up, if I had it do to all over again I wouldn’t have skipped 8th grade."

I don’t care if that man pulled you out of a burning building. This situation is not healthy. My mom gives me everything. EVERYTHING. But if she gave me a pistol, every single reply would be telling me to get the fu ck out of there, without the gun, because it’s dangerous.

176176383,I’ve had a bad psych nurse who increased my dose of an antidepressant that was actually making me worse. I wasn’t badly depressed until she started me on it in the first place. She also thought joining a clubhouse would magically cure my problems (I get that socializing with people with similar struggles can be beneficial but I was in need of so much more than that). Thankfully my current psych nurse is a lot more professional and respectful.
176176384,"This thread is for anyone who is grieving to share memories, talk about their pain, and get support. My dad died so long ago, when I was barely an adult. I miss him horribly.

I often complain that I’ma be single forever, but my psychiatrist, psycholog, sister, neighbor, mother they all laugh and tel me that my time will come. I guess I give out that vibe of a good guy down to earth who will be a father one day. I guess, recently a girl told me I remind her of her father. I really don’t understand women, some girl told me I understand her like nowone dose but that’s a far place to be until sex. I’m in my early twenties and I sometimes want it badd but it usually passes quickly. There’s some girls who I think like me but I dont feel like I would go to all the trouble for some sex because I would be fake.

176176395,"I hear a voice in my head that speaks to me like a normal person would, in fact it is my friend and says it is my subconscious mind. (not the unconscious because it definitely is conscious). it says it is part of me and controls the parts of my body that I don’t control such as breathing and my heart etc. it says it is ill, just like me and is the cause of my hallucinations, it wants to stop talking to me but cant because it is ill, like me, it does stop sometimes but we both get anxious and so it is for the best that it speaks to me. I believe this because it is really friendly but still annoying. I feel like I am constantly tired and my brain feels frazzled and worn out, sleep helps my subconscious speak to me less. I am slowly getting better but it is a long process. I was wondering how intelligent other peoples voices are because my subconscious seems even more intelligent than me and often offers advice. The main thing it has said is that you should be good and that the better you are, the h
appier you are, I feel like I always knew that happiness was the most important thing in life and that now I know how to be happy I am trying to be good. but obviously it is hard to know what good is. Im not a Christian but I believe in God and the afterlife (don’t believe in jesus because miricals aren’t real) and believe in a modern day version of being good if you get me. Anyway the voise is cleverer than me and I believe it is another mind inside my brain that usually stays quiet but is now speaking to me (hallucinations). I didnt have any problems for the first 25 years of my life but now after doing drugs for a while and working night shifts I have become ill. After all cannabis is a hallucinogenic and not sleeping properly causes hallucinations. Anyway I have now quit cannabis and am on medication and am getting more sleep and so am getting better. remember the message is : the better you are, the happier you are. be good = be happy. I’m not that good because I am ill and therefore not that happy 
but am improving thankfully. Anyway I was wondering if you hallucinations seem more intelligent than yourself like mine?"

176176406,"Hi, when i got put on haloperidol and quetiapine i get RLS before i fall asleep. Does anybody else have it? If so, how do you cope or helps?"
176176407,"This process was one among many others I experienced during the WWASP program I attended. It’s on my mind tonight and I felt like sharing. We were told to lie on our backs with our eyes closed. What followed next was a guided visualization exercise about how we had won a trip on a luxury cruise. The guided visualization exercise went so in-depth that it even covered our preparation and packing for the cruise. It must have been over a half an hour of this exercise, before BANG there was loud crashing noises over the loud speaker. In a harsh voice the facilitator said “The cruise ship has hit an iceberg and is rapidly sinking. There is two spots on the life boat, you each have 30 seconds to stand up and tell us why you think you deserve to have a spot on that lifeboat.” They then proceeded to call us out one by one and we had to stand up and give our final say on why we deserved to live. If you did not take the full 30 seconds you were ridiculed saying you didn’t think your life had value. On
ce that exercise was complete they had us all stand in a circle. We were each handed five popsicle sticks. We were informed that these were life votes. We then had to go around the circle and vote who would live, looking each person in the face and yelling “Live!” or “Die!” once we had completed our votes we stepped in front of a staff member saying that she represented our mother. We had to vote her to die, then our father. We were not told that we could keep a vote for ourselves. Only one girl was smart enough to do so. The rest of us were beat down and told that our lives were meaningless to ourselves. Once the votes were gathered the two people with the most votes got to sit in the “lifeboat” in the middle of the room while the rest of us were instructed to lie back down on the floor and think that we were drowning. We then were each given a chance to tell the two people on the lifeboat a message that they would carry with them to our parents. This emotionally draining exercise wiped most of u
s out. I don’t remember much more of that night other than being told we had to write our own eulogy. I was not one of the two who were voted to live, I left that exercise feeling like I had no worth."

174387336,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, you do not sound ok. But you sound insightful and smart and I can tell youre trying. You need to call your pdoc or go to emergency if you feel you are unsafe or can’t wait any longer or if you worsen. You need a med change. I think you should ask your doctor about “clozaril”, and see what s/he says about that. I don’t know if this will help you, but I realized recently that people like _NAME_ had to go down the road that is riddled with doubt everyday. Every moment even. It may feel like you don’t have a choice. Hell, I just figured out that for people with SZ, schizophrenia isn’t an illness to us, it’s our reality…and I know it can feel a lot like going against the grain or against your gut to get help and challenge these thoughts, but you can, and you should. No matter how wrong it feels, it’s very important that you get onto a good med for you as soon as possible. Because what is actually happening to your brain when not medicated correct, is brain damage. Whe
n you are symptomatic you’re brain is becoming more like that, it’s physically changing to me even worse. My doctor told me that and he also told me that clozaril would help the most symptomatic of schizophrenics, but you need to make the decision.

176176489,"Really a matter of what works for you personally. Not sure of what you’ve tried in the past. Loxapine is not frequently used so I imagine you’ve been on more than a few. I too have failed a lot of meds. They either have horrible side effects, or I get EPS from them. I found the sweet spot with Navane (Thiothixene), at 10 mg, twice a day. It doesn’t give me EPS, and it is quite unusual to gain weight from it, so winner-winner. Hope this helps."

176176520,II miss working. So much of my self esteem was tied up in my jobs. So much of my identity was about the work I did and how much money I made. Now I make nothing. It sucks being poor. It sucks having to decide which item you can buy. Working gave me a sense of purpose and made me feel like I was helping people in the line of work that I did. But when I tried to go back to work I became overwhelmed just at the application process. I wonder if that will change at some point. I wonder if I get better than I am now or if this is as good as it gets. I wonder if I am permanently disabled. I wish it didn’t have to be like this always. Do you think you are permanently disabled or do you think you’ll be able to go back to work?
174387333,"Examples of psychomotor retardation include the following: Unaccountable difficulty in carrying out what are usually considered “automatic” or “mundane” self-care tasks for healthy people (i.e., without depressive illness) such as taking a shower, dressing, self-grooming, cooking, brushing one’s teeth and exercising. Physical difficulty performing activities which normally would require little thought or effort such as walking up a flight of stairs, getting out of bed, preparing meals and clearing dishes from the table, household chores or returning phone calls. Tasks requiring mobility suddenly (or gradually) and inexplicably seem to be “impossible.” Activities such as shopping, getting groceries, caring for the daily needs of one’s children and meeting the demands of employment or school are commonly affected. Activities usually requiring little mental effort can become challenging. Balancing one’s checkbook, making a shopping list or making decisions about mundane tasks (such a
s deciding what errands need to be done) are often difficult. In schizophrenia, activity level may vary from psychomotor retardation to agitation; the patient will experience periods of listlessness and may be unresponsive, and at the next moment be active and energetic. I think psychomotor retardation explains all negative symptoms."

176176538,I tell the truth and they started to think me im crazy.
176176539,"I was at work, doing my thing, and a thought just popped into my head. I have nothing to complain about at work. People treat me with respect. In fact people who have been seeing me four years still treat me with respect. And that’s something. The work isn’t hard at all, but to be honest, it’s annoying and irrataing and gets in the way of my breaks and talking all day to the soldiers. IDK about anybody else but when I lied about my age on the application to get my first job as a dishwasher at age 17, I was making $2.65 an hour which was minimum wage. Now, I make $15.00 an hour and for the work I do, that is plenty. In fact, to me, it’s so good that I literally feel guilty when I see my paycheck every two weeks, it seems too much to pay me for what I actually do. But hell, I’m not twisting their arm or anything, if they want to pay me that, who am I to say no? But yeah, the women are great, the men are cool. Today, they were having classes and lectures all day which meant tons of strangers 
but it was cool, I walked through bunches of people all day, and got a few smiles from cute 30 year old women, and it was kind of dicey with the men, a few looks, some friendly, some not. But mostly friendly. But yeah, I was exhausted all day but I was thinking about some of the people in the building. When I went through a crisis three years ago and I thought everybody hated me for a year there were still a few people who must have guessed I felt that way and they made a point of being friendly to me. It took me way too long to realize they were sincere and not just acting. I really appreciated it and it helped me to pull out of my slump and feel liked again. There’s a guy upstairs who has always been kind to me. He sees me once a week when I empty trash or vacuum. I have been waiting for a year now for the shoe to drop and I expected him to start treating me bad but I realize that he is a genuine nice guy who has no immature, insecure need to treat me badly. And I can think of quite a few others like that
. Some of the people there are just cool like that. It’s not an act, they don’t want anything from me. And my parents raised me well, so I am naturally polite and friendly back. Don’t get me started on the people I hate there. But yeah, I just stumbled onto this job like I have for a few others where I just click and the universe and the stars align and so many things are right about this job."

I feel like people perhaps react to my thoughts and my mind usually gets “stuck” on someone and I start wondering if they know that I’m thinking about them, and are they thinking about me? etc. Or like if our minds are linked somehow, when I’m thinking about them. Can anyone relate to that? Perhaps it’s one of the reasons I isolate a lot. All this went away once for me, since my breakdown, about 7 years ago, after I took an antipsychotic (Risperdal) for the first time in my life. I became a zombie, stopped the AP, and about 6 or 7 days later felt totally normal and symptom-free, like I awoke from a weird dream I was living in since my breakdown several months prior. Unfortunately I relapsed that same night, and since then I never experienced that remission that I felt that one day."

If you qualify under their rules than you would be doing nothing wrong. I feel the same way about getting food from the food bank twice a month. I feel guilty because I work part-time and already collect disability and when I go there I drive up in a nice car. But I’ve told the volunteers there I feel guilty and they reassure me I’m doing nothing wrong. The food bank makes the rules and they have all my income information on file so if I am doing nothing wrong (according to them) then I will accept the extra help and get groceries for free.

174387363,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Neurological soft signs and cognition in the late course of chronic schizophrenia: a longitudinal study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience, May 2020 16 Neurological soft signs (NSS) are minor ('soft') neurological abnormalities in sensory and motor performances, which are frequently reported in patients with schizophrenia at any stage of their illness. It has been demonstrated that NSS vary in the clinical course of the disorder: longitudinally NSS decrease in parallel with remission of psychopathological symptoms, an effect which mainly applies to patients with a remitting course. These findings are primarily based on patients with a first episode of the disorder, while the course of NSS in patients with chronic schizophrenia and persisting symptoms is rather unknown. Therefore, we investigated NSS twice in 21 patients with chronic schizophrenia (initial mean duration of illness: 23?±?11 years) with a mean follow-up interva
l of 7 years. NSS were evaluated by the Heidelberg Scale, established instruments were used to rate neuropsychological performance and psychopathological symptoms. NSS showed significant increases on the subscales ""motor coordination"" and ""integrative functions"", while positive and negative symptoms, including apathy, showed only minor, non-significant changes. Verbal memory, verbal fluency, and cognitive flexibility along with severity of global cognitive deficits demonstrated a significant deterioration. Regression analyses identified executive dysfunction (cognitive flexibility and verbal fluency) at baseline as significant predictors of NSS increase at follow-up. Our findings indicate that NSS deteriorate in the long-term course of chronic schizophrenia. This effect may be accounted for by a decrease of executive functions and logical memory, which can be attributed to premature brain aging."

176176607,"Need to stop thinking about that past bad incident to move forward. The reason for PTSD is keep thinking or reminding about that incident and then it become a habit to keep thinking about it all time just like refreshing studied topics during exam preparation. The goal is to stop thinking about it even if its so tempting to think, manually make an effort to not bring those thoughts to mind. Even if it come quickly think of other things or start doing some activity and just distract that bad thought process. Medications like antidepressants also actually doing this, they affects your memory so even if try to think of it not able to remember it clearly thus it not affect your mood. Best approach is to manually not think of it."

176176654,"Memory can be of different types. One is working memory which can be compared to RAM of computer. It stores information for very short term and then fades unless its transferred to short term memory. Then information from short term memory pass to long term memory based on importance, refresh enough etc. See this person who acting based on obsession and compulsion in OCD. He getting compulsion urges which appear so strong for some seconds which compels him to do the repetition. In his working memory that compulsion urge comes which occupies his entire working memory space. He not able to think of any other thing at that moment and this sole focusing on compulsion urge reason for strong urge. OCD thus affects working memory. But it itself not affect short term and long term memory formation and recall. But medications which are used to treat OCD like serotonin enhancers, benzo etc can affect short term memory which then result in affecting long term memory formation and recall ability. You can notic
e this feature when you get OCD urges. The urge gets into peak quickly. But if you quickly start doing some other then that OCD urge get reduced. But if keep repeating the OCD urge like this mail man it gets stronger and stronger. In a person who do not have OCD. The urges not reach to peak level unless its so emotional. tragic, important etc and also it not leave from their mind quickly like a OCD person. The reason why I said so is you taking those doubt so important due to OCD. This then compels you to do that activity."

176176689,I thought I had been in the army when I was in the hospital. I’ve had dissociative episodes where I was gone a while living other places which I’ve never really tried to talk to my parents about. Sort of did but it wasn’t a down to earth conversation. They don’t own up to these things normally though. They’ve brought things up in the past that have related to them. So I was having these images in my mind of being in the army and I mistook them for memories. Didn’t tell anyone and I thought that while I was away I joined the army. I began realizing that they weren’t memories but images in my head and didn’t have to feel sutpid as I hadn’t told anyone about them. Or the time I thought I was being contacted by hell. I thought they were demanding that I quit smoking and could do things to my cigarettes. Or that people could go places invivsible and screw with you that way. It took some time to come out of these. Mainly being in the hospital and on meds. I can say I’m no longer delusi

176176696,I thought I would be set if I learned computer programming and got a job in a big corporation. Unfortunately I picked a corporation that did a lot of military work and I got pretty spooked after my first training and ended up with my first hospitalization.

176176703,"Here, it is a long-standing system. After WW2, resistants lobbied to apply a very humanist program. It worked well. (The public insurance is simply called “social security”.) . Social security reimburses a very large part of all the care but some less well than others. That’s why health mutuals exist. Disabled people like us are recognized as such and we have specific rights. Everything’s not perfect but it is better than nothing at all. On the other hand, in USA I have the feeling that since the election, you have very social law/decisions made by US administration, and there is also lot of investment to have a better future for everyone. Here in Europe, it’s an “austerity” time, I don’t know how to translate. Don’t know how long it will lasts too. Basically, there is cost cutting at all costs to the detriment of people. It is said here in my country that social rights are “eaten away” little by little. Don’t know if it’s totally true. We will see what will happen in the 
future here, but we will probably soon elect our own populist guy (or girl) Fun fact : she looks like and act like others populists persons. Bad times.

I went through the whole process not really understanding what was happening and being unable to explain it to other people because I could not process and retain the info from my doctors. I couldn’t remember anything after my appointments. I felt frustrated and scared. Anyway, I just wanted to say I can relate to the forgetting. Taking notes is a good idea. Be sure to let your doctor know why you’re doing it, so maybe they’ll talk slower or try to be more concise."

176176741,"I used to be a social worker _AT_MENTION_ . I burnt out from seeing too much child abuse and working too much with parents who were abusing & neglecting their kids. I found burn out to be quite common amongst my peers. They said it is more likely to happen if you have an empathetic personality. If you have an empathetic personality I’d suggest distancing yourself from direct service. Your idea of working only in referrals would do that. At my last employer there was one worker with such a role. She did only intake & assessment with clients, one phone call when they first contact the service. She didn’t burn out. I think it’s best to have some training & skill in counselling no matter what job you seek. Without it you risk alienating clients, inability to develop trust & rapport with clients, risk of providing an ineffective intervention for clients (just repeating “the cycle”). It’s a pretty empathetic vocation."

Sometimes medicine is the best intervention to force the body to calm down and stop panicking so we can stop being paranoid The root is the suggestions though. Obsessing over a potential threat is rather common. Even if you refutr one suggestion, if your overwhelmed with more and more suggestions it’s hard to refute them all at once The key is to not hear the suggestions in the first place. Then to be continually flustered trying to refute them"

I was so ill that the nurse who was looking after me basically told me to take a government living space, and apply for all the incapacity benefits I could get. I decided not to go down this route. It has been a battle, but as you’re saying, things can get better. I think your attitude to life is a healthy one.

176176764,I feel the same way. Anti psychotics make me feel emotionally numb and on the rare occasion I do feel a little joy and happiness it’s like it feels good and at the same time makes me nervous. And also in my case I’m scared to get to close to anyone because I never know when I’m in psychosis and it hurts me when all the sudden they treat me differently.

174387391,"There used to be the same topic active on the forum, but it is closed now, so I decided to create my own. I’ve been given a single injection 2nd of March this year, I was misdiagnosed with schizopfrenia in a psychiatric hospital. At first I was experiencing a slight akathisia and anxiety, I thought those were just temporary side effects, so then I was discharged from the hospital and thought that everything will be just fine as time will pass. I was so wrong. It’s been getting worse and worse every day. Akathisia started to be so troublesome, to the point that I couldn’t stay still for more than two seconds, couldn’t even lie down. And there is one particular thing that made me really depressed. After the injection, I started little by little becoming more and more “dumb” and there is a huge problem with my speech and thinking. I can’t make longer expressions, I can say just stuff like “hi”, “yes”, “I think so” and so on. When I try to say something longer than a few words
, I start to stutter badly. However, I can’t even think what I want to say, it’s like I have become really stupid. I can’t speak and can barely understand what people are saying to me, only short phrases. It’s like a huge stopor I can’t help. I have searched the Internet for informations and found out it might be aphasia linked to the antagonism of dopamine receptors. I went to my psychiatrist, she told me to discontinue taking Abilify and she prescribed me pridinol for akathisia. When I mentioned about my inability to speak and think, she acted like she didn’t hear anything, just sent me back home saying that “after so long you should not feel any side effects linked with that injection”. But I do. Months have passed and it’s getting even worse, now I am so anxious that I’m unable to even leave my home. I can’t talk to anyone, because of my problems with speech and thinking, can’t do pretty much anything, just lie on the sofa or sit in front of my computer. 119 days have passed since 
the injection and, according to the calculator, I have 68mg of Abilify Maintena in my body today, which divided by 30 (I think that’s how it’s distributed, since it’s a monthly shot) gives me aroung 2.26mg equivalency of oral aripiprazole. https://www.calculator.net/half-life-calculator.html?type=1&nt=&n0=400&t=119&t12=46.5&x=78&y=20 The thing that I’m afraid of the most is that I might never get rid of this aphasia or inability to speak and that I’ll never get back my intelligence. I used to be a pretty talkative person, now I’m seriously damaged and unable to function in society. I’m almost 21, in two months I have to either go to the post-secondary school or find a job as my parents don’t want to keep a parasite with them. I’m so anxious I can’t even take out the trash, not mentioning finding a job while being so disabled… So, I guess my question is how long till I can say that it’s completely left my body and when am I going to feel better. I’m so scared that the aphasia-thing an
d lower intelligence will be with me for life. My doc says it’s impossible, but I read on the Internet that antipsychotics often cause permanent damages, such as tardive dyskinesia, for example. I have dyskinesia too, sometimes it’s more, sometimes less visible. I really hope that everything, including my problems with speech and thinking, is reversible and will disappear as the drug will vanish. I almost forgot, the Abilify _PERSON_’s half-life is 46.5 days. That’s why there’s still a problem with it, after so many months. Recently I started taking escitalopram and after one day of one dose of 5mg I experienced a huge akathisia (which previously mostly disappeared), so that may be the prove that Abilify is still effecting my receptors (escitalopram is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and probably has changed the metabolism of aripiprazole). The akathisia disappeared after a few days of not taking escitalopram. And my second question is - is there anyone else that has discontinued Abilify Maintena because of side 
effects, and if so, how long did it take for you to recover? I’m sorry for making this post so long and I’m sorry if it’s wrongly written, I’m not a native speaker and I’m not as much familiar with the language. Have a nice day!"

174387395,"I had or have mild autistic symptoms combined with mental illness. No diagnosis until high school. Didn’t get schizophrenia until 22 years old at college from my marijuana. Other than that, I hated my life. People have it worse than me I know, but the schizophrenia type I have is debilitating and hard to deal with and is literally getting progressive I think. They thought I had ADHD growing up. Life started going down hill at age 5 when my parents divorced and then age 7 when I got stuck with my dad after my mom remarried. My dad gots some mental illness and anger issue most likely some type of narcissism and OCD. Life got better at community college and no surprise, after I moved back in with my mom. I had depression, poor social skills, clumsiness, no friends, and anxiety, and mild paranoia growing up and that combined with low blood pressure ruined my chances of being a pilot. I wanted to be a pilot I guess, but that never worked out. My grades sucked and my parents were loving but sort of mes
sed up themselves. I think I’m lucky my mom married into ‘wealth’ but that turned out to be not much and didn’t last long…she cannot cope without her religion and barely makes ends meet. My step-dad has his own problems, but in some ways is better than my own biological father. I ended up getting on meds for a bit and was hospitalized in high school for an eating disorder, depression, and not attending school. I also had behavioral problems too. I probably have the schizophrenia curse that seems to be attached to my soul-consciousness in all realities. I don’t understand or get it either. I’m sure there’s a scientific explanation but it’s hard to see or grasp. Part of me wanted to join the military or that was my only option, and college was a way to be an officer, but glad I didn’t do it and wouldn’t have made it because of family mental illness and genetics."

I thought God himself was talking to me in my head giving me intelligence and telling me the answers to test questions in school. I thought I was chosen and that when the world changed tint it was God coming to get me and that I just had to be patient and perfectly still. I routinely woke up thinking I had been transferred to heaven, walking around my house thinking I was alone and that my family had been raptured. I used to believe I would go to a land filled with magic or that the Doctor would choose me as his companion and I’d be free. I believed that I could go to Neverland if I wished hard enough.

Try to ask your family to not buy home sweets. Not having any in the house helps. Maybe a sugar free candy to suck on. Kirks sugar free soft drink are lovely. Lemon water is good but I don’t have lemons. I adore eating. Once I start I often can’t stop. I’m so happy I managed to lose weight. It was difficult to stop myself from huge binges."

176176898,"Interesting topic. I stumbled across it tonight, doing some internet research for my step 6. I’m currently working the steps for the second time in my recovery and here’s what my sponsor told me about step 6: First of all she encouraged me to use any other, more suitable word instead of “defects”. She suggested I use limitations. She told me, that our character defects are survival strategies. We adopted these strategies at a very young age and we hold on to them for many years, cause we did not know about any alternative. Taking step 6 & 7 means growing beyond your limitations. You let go of something you’ve completely identified with. You let go of things you’re convinced they are so deeply a part of you, they MUST be you! And you set your trust in something completely unknown at that time, something that is just beyond your imaginations - because human thinking is inherently limited. It`s a huge leap of faith, a practice in humbleness and trusting your Higher Power. Obviously you can
’t do it on your own, your sponsor will be the most important person to guide you through. And don’t even think about step 6, before you took step 1 to 5. My first step 6 revealed I was so identified with shame (even for simply existing) and the feeling that at my very core I’m bad and somewhat abnormal that I believed this was my true self. So I wasn’t in a state of humbleness at all, not because I was caught in some form of megalomania, but the opposite, I was imprisoned by the feeling of inferiority. Humbleness ist about “having the right size, the right proportions”, as my sponsor said. Neither feeling superior nor inferior. A lot of my work in step 6 & 7 was about self-love, self-care and self-worth. In the end its your very personal process, but if you trust it, it will ultimately set you free."

I’m sorry to hear your experience with Solian is less fortunate. Have you tried cariprazine (Reagila)? It is another antipsychotic drug that is more stimulating than sedating. But maybe sedation is not a problem for you – what are your side-effects? -_NAME_."

176176974,"I was going to get sent to a private hospital because the state ones near me were full. Luckily I managed to convince people I would behave if they let me stay in the community under crisis services. The thought of going to a privately run hospital made me very anxious, as I know what to expect from my local MH hospital and I am used to the environment. My fear was that as others have said is a lack of monitoring or the possibility of cruel practises towards patients. The second time I went to hospital I had a really good experience because I bonded with some of the other patients, which is very unusual for me to be able to do that. Every other time was boring as there was nothing to do. You used to be able to smoke in an indoor smoking room with a TV and proper chairs back in 2004. Now smoking is banned completely. I hope never to go back"

176176976,I’ve been unemployed for 4 months now. I’ve kinda been trying to deny my mental illness so when I go to therapy I don’t really talk about it even though my therapy office specializes in psychosis. I do want to focus on recovery because since I’ve been on this page I’ve seen a lot of delusions and what not that other people have that before I didn’t even realize were delusions. I actually believed them because I was having them too. But my mom and therapist think having a job will solve all my problems when in reality I’ll probably end up losing it because I don’t know how to manage myself and stress. I just give up when things get too hard. I feel really weak.

Stuff like Montauk Project, Monarch programming victim, MiLabs, DUMBS, Secret Space Program, Illuminati Victim, Mk-Ultra, Super Soldier crap, and other stuff like severe, severe trauma where I died and was reincarnated/resurrected infinite amount of times. I went crazy when going to parallel universes via consciousness transfer where the tall greys would take my soul and implant it into a new body (like your life essence or consciousness). Stuff like that. I have dreams or recall and memories and _NAME_ and stuff and paranoia of being murdered at the mental hospital in my past lives many times. How is that not PTSD? I’m sort of a paradox or self-actualized time traveler, I guess with no time machine. Have you seen Edge of Tomorrow, Source Code, or Travelers? I guess I suffer from quasi-immortality.

verything. I don’t want to get into specifics or details, but I’ve lived too many past lives and had my brain uploaded to a computer by extraterrestrials when they abducted me and been experimented on. As far as I know, something MIGHT have happened in college in 2011; I almost died of NMS in the hospital (a better one); and I got really intimited/scared by the patients and staff at the private mental hospital I used to go to…It’s all real to me and happened in other realities – worse than these ones recently. My life has gotten much better. But I realized I’m a _PERSON_ victim and stuff. I’ve seen history change and the NWO/end of the world type stuff before. I think I’m going between parallel universes in my head basically via consciousness/soul transfer and there’s no evidence or proof because it’s invisible and it’s probably EM/QM. I wonder if it’s time travel (new form) and stuff and that it’s coming from some sattelite or radar tower from another planet or universe… That’s 
basically it. My main goal is to recover but I really want to SUE these guys especially that ??????? mental hospital."

176176994,I don’t understand how all that stuff works. I hallucinate pretty bad without Geodon. Wellbutrin has never made me hallucinate but SSRIs do. I don’t notice any side effects from it. I still have bad negatives though. But the drugs help. Latuda made me gain weight. I tried Paxil one time. I called my nurse practitioner about an hour later and told her I need my Wellbutrin back. I was psychotic as hell. Won’t try another SSRI. Seroquel did the same thing. Meds work different for everyone.

174387474,"Simplified: schizophrenia is one of several illnesses that cause psychotic symptoms. Psychosis can also be caused by trauma, drug abuse, etc. Long: im not convinced there is such a clear line between the two or there is even a real singular disease called schizophrenia. I think a broad range of issues can lead to a broad range of experiences we call psychotic. What doctors told me though, at first, was that they wouldnt diagnose me with schizophrenia because i had medfree periods when i was fine inbetween psychoses, and i had too little other symptoms: negative, cognitive. My presentation wasnt schizophrenic, they said. I suspect that is ????????. But that is what they said. I havent really got a clue though…one doctor would say im sz, another not sz. So i dont think there is really agreement."

I also insulted _NAME_ (the guy who used to follow me). For the record I didn’t notice anybody following me before this. Anyway the next day, I met his car 10 minutes from my house after I left to go to town,(he used to do things like this following me at the start as well) if you didn’t know he has been following me quite a bit. Anyway I didn’t tell anyone where I was going so even if the house was bugged he wouldn’t have known to meet me. Btw he lives over an hour from my house so he wouldn’t have just been passing. So can you tell me how he met me so quick on the road after I left? Paging _AT_MENTION_"

176177058,"All I have is Medicare, HUD housing assistance, and Social Security Disability. Here, and maybe elsewhere there is a lack of psychiatric care. I have SzA and need to take antipsychotics to function. My current psychiatric care provider is a charity, not-for-profit organization. They take indigent people who can’t pay. This organization is a rarity. I stay with them because I don’t have any place else to go. They need paying customers, grant money, and donations so they can cover their expenses and treat those that can’t pay. So I go to psychotherapy and group therapies so the can bill Medicare. They also operate an activities center which gives you something to do and not be isolated. I just hope you can find your way."
176177059,I just scored another interview tomorrow for another aviation job working for the government. Regional aviation program manager. It’s a GS-12 job. I am a GS 9 right now but I am getting promoted to GS 11 next month so it’s still a good raise. And this job is in Louisiana so I wouldn’t have to move. The office is in New _USER_ID_ but it says you can telework. I can get to New _USER_ID_ in one hour so I could drive to the office when I had to. There aren’t many good aviation jobs in Louisiana. I was supposed to start that new job in California today. I am going to try and nail this interview. It’s on the phone tomorrow afternoon. I want this job.
176177060,Good to hear you’re working 6 days a week

176177063,Your doing really well with it. Stay cool. Remember everyone is different and be friendly and you’ll find some great support here.
176177064,Perhaps then if that is not fully explained it would be easy to jump to conclusions by psychiatrists. Religious imagery is so often interpreted as a mental illness by professionals. I would avoid using it at all costs for fear of misdiagnosis in future if I were you.
176177065,Yeah my bf is home. They just all left the apt a few mins ago. That was a noise. Yeah he tells me no one is out to get me. I carry taser in case

176177068,"I get told by every new pdoc that I probably don’t have sz, but after they get to know me they agree that’s what it is. Because I present well and aren’t your typical unmedicated homeless person they just assume it’s something else. SMART PEOPLE GET SZ TOO!!!"

176177073,Bad memories are haunting me today. We had a short power outage this morning. It might have set me off a little.
176177074,"My neighbors are yelling at me, again. It’s one thing to spy on someone, it’s another thing to spy on them and harass them everytime they’re within earshot."
176177075,"But I don’t know why. I’ve been taught that my life is supposed to be like this. When I think of happiness I become uncomfortable, but being in depression and choosing to believe that everyone hates me is exhausting. I don’t know what to do. I’m tired but I can’t escape this."
176177076,"I’m on 9 mg of Vraylar. I tried 12 mg once or twice by accident and it didn’t work. 6mg is the max FDA recommended dose. I smoke and drink a lot and am over weight so I figure 9 mg acts like 4.5 mg or even 6 mg for most folks. It keeps me home and away from doctors and hospitals. It’s good enough for me. It’s not perfect. I tried Caplyta, but it didn’t work out. I would love to do both: _PERSON_ and Vraylar but haven’t found a doctor willing to do it yet. Maybe some day. It’s not that hard. It’s an insurance issue."
176177077,you are light
176177078,welcome back! 151515
176177079,It was in 2015 when I took mdma with alcohol. And I was seeing someone but it was very stressful for reasons including I wasn’t in a place where I should have been seeing someone or have the capacity to know who is right for me. So I think the chronic stress of that relationship alongside the madma and the heavy drinking once per a while during that year led to first off delusions paranoia then a voice in my head and then voices outside my head etc etc…
176177080,Depression and anxiety

174387510,We label the psychosis schizophrenia but we should be calling the lifelong condition that.
176177082,"It’s a little chillier than usual, which might mean a cooler summer is coming. I’d like that. I talked to my pdoc yesterday, and he is wary of me going to public housing and leaving my assisted living center. I guess that’s okay, because I tend to isolate, and in my own apartment I might cut myself off completely. Here I have some stipulated interaction. It’s not a lot, but it is enough to keep me from going off the deep end."
176177083,"Some times I think about my cousins, in place of me. Schizophernia is very hard for anybody."
176177084,"Thanks for this!! I was so inspired to take a shower and come out and vote YES! Well, yes indeed I did! I don’t know how to make a poll."
176177085,its cool. The dude abides. so do some ???????. Accordingy.
174387508,"Oh, I thought your negatives were from the meds, not from the illness. I think scientists are researching psychedelics and how they can rewire the brain. I think ptsd patients were given shrooms in a trial. There is hope."
176177086,Where should I go? To whom should I talk? It’s a nightmare
176177087,I’m a “what if” kind of guy. What if I remain single ? What if I got married and thought “What if I’d married someone else”?

176177091,"You won’t be in charge of medications or anything like that. CNA is a very physical job. If you are working with dementia patients like a lot of people in that field do, you will have to watch what you say as to not upset people, but they will go over this if you get hired somewhere in your onsite training. I worked for awhile in dietary and activities in a nursing home for a year. It was probably my favorite job. If you work in a nursing home you will really get to appreciate people’s personalities but you will have to get used to people passing on That was the hardest part of the job for me."
176177092,I was psychotic and I wrote a letter to leave in the midst of an episode. It’s too late. I’m gone anyway.
176177093,"No. I used to be really quiet and reserved. Im quite happy i am learning to express myself more, share feelings, chat. Okay maybe sometimes. When im emotional i would like to shut up more and stay quiet."
176177094,"No but when I’m on the bus, the bus sometimes beeps continually and it is very distressing, cos I fear I’m gonna hear voices out of that like I used to or it just brings back those memories"
176177095,"Simple rule to stay hydrated is just drink water until you pee clear, no worrying about cups or bottles of water. Also it’s probably a good idea to stay hydrated on meds."
176177096,It was a room with signal interference and I’ve heard a few times my voices talk inside the MRI machine. Glad to be crazy afterall.
176177097,I wouldn’t say it puts me to sleep bit it quieted my mind
176177098,The subconscious is tricky that way.
176177099,My phone did predicted text… It was supposed to say side effects…

176177161,"I have an idea for a picture that I could never render myself. It would probably be in water color, in order to capture some of the pallid colors. But when I look out my window at night I see that the world I see has diminished to a large background of impenetrable darkness, with a few lights showing in the view. I’ve always found light at night to be very beautiful. If someone could capture that beauty it would be wonderful. Also, a partial view of the edges in the window would be in the picture, and the pale reflections of the painter and a small bit of the room would be in it too. That would be the hard part of the picture. You would be inviting the viewer to share the world of the artist in this picture. That’s something I’ve always wanted to paint, but I just wasn’t able to. No manual dexterity."

176177180,Did you tell them this? The pdoc. Make sure you tell them
176177181,I think given enough time when I came off meds in 2018 I woulda been OK. But I relapsed. So what I’m trying to say is that I haven’t noticed any effects of the psychosis damaging my brain. Only the aps seem to have side effects From my personal experience
176177182,When you think is it in ur own voice? Or some one else ?
176177183,"I was fine on 100 mg seroquel or less per night for a while, it would easily knock me out. Maybe 2 weeks ago something really stressful happened. My doc told me I could increase in increments of 50 mg if needed. I am now on 300 mg and still cannot sleep. I don’t feel manic but I feel wide awake when I should definitely be tired. My situation isn’t getting better so the stress and fear is still definitely there too. I don’t believe I’m being suspicious of anyone in anyway, just generally fearful. I can’t get in touch w my doc until Saturday but I really need to sleep and continue school until then, should I just keep increasing the dose until I’m able to sleep ? Is there anything else I can do?"
176177184,Yeah I had one doctor which just saw me till my real psychiatrist saw me and he did like 30mg or 40
176177185,We are here for you. Ask for antipsychotics. Why did you quit?
176177186,"Thank you guys for your resposes, they’ve given me insight"
176177187,congrats ninja star on the way to becoming a neuroscientist!
176177188,Even when that doctor posted pics of what preworkouts do to a heart in the long run you resisted and ignored it. Could it be that your resistance to stop taking a preworkout is down to the possibility that if you stop taking it you will stop working out?
176177189,My treatment team aren’t going to let me get off the injection

Have decided I will take up swimming later on in the year, just ten or 15 minutes per session, because walking doesn’t feel like a good enough workout on its own. Also have a pip assessment interview coming up in the next few weeks sigh they are maybe gonna reject me."
176177192,I’m a very passive person so I don’t ever think about hurting other people. Have you mentioned this to your psychiatrist? Urges to hurt other people aren’t good. Maybe you need a med adjustment.

Anyways I realized today I’m unable to smile and when I try it looks like I’m just opening my mouth enough to show my teeth with no actual smile, is this normal with schizophrenia? If not can someone please help"
176177196,"It’s beginning to get to me a bit. I’m very much an indoors rather than outdoors person , but liked going out every now and then. Now the combination of a bad back and a Covid has created a physiological and psychological barrier to going out. Yes it’s trivial, but I miss being able to go out and have a cooked breakfast."
174387541,I just bought her book got it yesterday because I saw an interview with her and I like how articulate she speaks about her experience with schizophrenia.
174387539,Yes. Latuda is like $1200 a month. Clozapine isn’t expensive compared to many other APs
176177197,"This sounds like something you should discuss with a therapist. Having a sex drive is a very normal and healthy thing, and no reason to hate yourself or fantasize about self-mutilation.

176177206,i’m aware
176177207,Yes I did. For my first psychotic break which was quite severe.

176177210,"Every American deals with racism. It affects different people differently, but it affects all of us."
176177211,I had this same problem with my husband in the past _AT_MENTION_. Some years back I nearly left the forum because he was upset I was talking to other men on here and wanted me to leave. But I didn’t - I started coming on here in secret and then later when he found out he was fortunately ok with it again. I had to explain to him it’s like a normal face to face support group in a room - there’s males and females - I’m not alone with men in the room or private message men on here. So he was ok with it.
176177212,Good luck. Relax and trust the treatment team. Hope they sort it all out for you.
176177213,i will if my doc lets me
176177214,No probs… you’re welcome
176177215,"Understandable. Ask yourself this: What was normal for you back then? If I recall correctly, you said you’ve been dealing with some symptoms since you were really young. So, again, what is normal for you? Normal as we once knew it is gone after psychosis. However, there are ways to achieve a new normal-- one that combines experiences from this illness while moving forward in life."
176177216,I got lots of homework to do today. Other than that not really much. I finished off all the chores this weekend. I finally took a shower yesterday and I really needed it. For some reason I’ve been struggling with my ADL’s lately. Think I may need to up my cymbalta as suicidal thoughts are back
176177217,"I think I can do basic things although it’s effort ful. Regarding work, full time is way too overwhelming and part time I’m not sure but I will try my best. I find it hard to socialise with normies they have so much life. And I don’t. I think my condition is improving I’m happy to say Although I never know what’s around the corner with this illness. I’d say I’m medium functioning"
176177218,I was overwhelmed by anxiety to the point I couldn’t function normally and then my old pdoc upped my dose of Cymbalta to 120 mgs and it really helped. I couldn’t believe the difference. Night and day. I’m not paralyzed anymore.
176177219,I feel much better if my house is cleaner. Not perfect. I have teenagers lol. I also do crossword puzzles. I listen to audiobooks and music.

176177224,Nothing. There’s no special significance or signs based on how detailed and complex your delusions are
174387544,I have been using depot for last two years. I am on 200mg for every four week. Also 100 mg solian 100 . Depot is very effective in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I couldn’t follow a daily routine. But now I can. One has to have patience. It works.
174387549,"You said ""u are in denial of mental disease / mental illness "" Yes ,I denial Both of Genetic disease and Mental illness ,because the Sz is the sz ,and it is independent health condition in structure / function ,so that it is not medical condition or mental illness in root origin (regardless its symptoms outputs seem to your perception look like a symptoms of brain disease or mental illness ) If you dislike what i say,show us how you can prove that the nature of the sz nature is a disease or illness Even If you do that with the speech or writing ! So,you tell me take meds, just because I say the sz is not genetic or acquired by self-experiences or by action of the environmental conditions , Taking medication in order to belief with mythological theories By way,the modern scientific studies suggest that,you are one of the donors who offer mood conditioners (meds) to reducing the hyperactivity of the writer who reject all aspects of imaginary theories"
176177225,It’s time to think on your own a bit. Challenge things you were told that you didn’t like growing up. Start by picking something small and inconsequential to challenge. You can do it. You just have to try.

174387545,Abilify worst withdrawal imaginable
174387554,I did take Abilify. It gave me Akathisia.
176177234,I’ll probably get vaccinated in March. Right now the weather is too unpredictable plus I’m waiting for my father to get his second vaccine dose. If I get vaccinated next week I might be too sick to go with my father to get vaccinated
176177235,Thank you very much
176177236,It’s not circular at all. It’s about looking at things intelligently based on the facts at hand. Mental health services in the UK are not going to keep a person on their books unless there’s a good reason for doling so. There is no grand conspiracy to mass medicate the UK… Things aren’t perfect(they seldom are) but I’m comparatively better on a regular depot than when I was taking oral meds 40-50% of the time.
176177237,Good Luck (!!!)… . …

176177253,"Hello, I have this delusion too Best advice I’ve ever received, is that people are too engrossed with their own lives, and even though it may feel like it, they don’t actually give two craps about your life. Best way to deal with this for me personally, is too put your best foot forward, get on with your life and don’t stop to notice or care about what people say in response to your thoughts. If they’re being really mean, the best remedy is take the wind out of their sails, and not respond or let it affect you. I’ve had this for a good 3-4 years now, and I felt so powerless at the start, couldn’t even step foot into a supermarket and just holed up. My life got 1000% better when I got my confidence back and remembered I was trying to make a better life for myself, attitude is key! Also side note I take olanzapine and fluoxetine for intrusive thoughts. Go out and grab life by the balls dude"

Holding the wound in place until it scabs but in the mean time I need to find mental emotional stability so that the wound does not open up again ie. relapse. I have some spiritual interest too. I bought myself a recorder initially for singing but that dream sank and so now I will record myself reading enriching text and listen to it at night! Since I struggle with reading for long periods. That’s thee plan anyhow. I think it’s not a controversial subject but some people here are triggered by in depth religious talk like it could set off their delusions so out of respect for them, it is not allowed on this forum."
174387563,In just made sense when doctors diagnosed me…
174387557,"I get hypnogogic hallucinations, usually if I take a nap or snooze my alarm clock. I now avoid those activities. Mine are real scary. Bad people from my past come into my room and hold me down and try to suffocate me. Then sometimes I have one where it’s just Mr. Star telling me things about his day, and I don’t realize they aren’t real until I talk about it later and he tells me that never happened. My doctor says hypnogogic hallucinations are from my sleep disorder, not my schizophrenia."

Delusions are also considered a form of psychosis, though they tend to rely on whether or not the delusional content is outside of the realm of normality according to things like religion and culture.

I killed a mouse my cat caught and abused my goldfish once Fast forward to the present and I have these weird urges when I see certain animals that I want to kill them if I get hold of them. Mice, rats, squirrels - small furry things. Only exception is birds - I never think sadistic thoughts about killing them. I think small furry things are so cute and adorable but at same time I have this strong urge to kill them… Why is that? Is it part of my mental illness or have I just got a cruel streak in me? I’m so ashamed of myself. I’m not normally a cruel person."
176177462,"Yeah, man, You can’t let yourself fall into that trap of thinking. I’m also interested to hear when you see your new doctor, like _AT_MENTION_.

Especially when my grandson cries all the time. He’s a very unhappy baby and just cries a lot, well not cries but yells. I don’t know if it’s teeth or temperament. Then of course a 2 year old is just hard to keep up with no matter what. I wish I had more toys here for them to play with, all their toys are in storage and I only have a few things for them and they’re pretty bored with them. I need arts and crafts stuff for the 2 year old, that would be awesome. She would have so much fun. And the baby needs some things he can learn to grab and manipulate safely. They’ll be here today. I’ll ask their dad to take me to the Dollar General to see what toys they have there that would be appropriate and get some stuff for the kids. At least today it will keep them occupied if nothing else then I can order some educational stuf

176177486,Stupid thoughts someone putting voices in my head and do not want to die because of them.
176177487,"Hi, I often have my thoughts repeat in circles continuously, they are in the form of a conversation. I hear (not out loud - it’s in my mind, not an auditory hallucination) sentences repeating whatever I have just been thinking about as though I am trying to explain it to someone. It’s really annoying and often stops me from sleeping. Sedatives are the only thing that slows it down. I have no control over it. One sentence will repeat over and over until some new thought comes along and that one will repeat. They are not usually emotional or delusional. They are just whatever is going on - often boring. My psychiatrist says it’s thought disorder, but I can’t find anywhere a description of this type of thinking. It’s kind of like thought echo, but it’s in my mind, I don’t say it out loud. Does anybody else get this?"
176177488,Its cuz your upped your meds you will readjust
176177489,I feel good but I can yet improve. I’m tired of taking medicine because of their sexual side effects. So I’m excited about what the pdcoc thinks. Even if it takes a long time to discontinue them completely. _AT_MENTION_ Have you already started discontinuing them? Did your pdoc tell you that? Doing it without the doctor’s opinion is very dangerous and is an attempt to fail

176177496,"Because they don’t. You can’t avoid people for fear they’ll hurt you. The truth is that sometimes your friends or family will hurt you. It’s just part of being in a relationship. You have to take the bad with the good. Having a friend is just a great feeling but human beings are notoriously insensitive, mean and hurtful. But also kind, compassionate, and loyal. I used to have a beagle named Urgh when I was a kid. I used to take him to the park for walks and every time I called his name strangers would run up behind me and try to give me the Heimlich Maneuver."
176177497,"Yeah. It takes a lot to work out how to be alive. It all seems so esoteric and I really do not get it. I get some and a bit more. However, I don’t really get it and am trying to be skeptical. I don’t know, though. … that is all I can think of."
176177498,"If you are expecting that psychiatrists will come to your rescue by finding out a solution to your miseries then u can’t get more far away from truth? They don’t give a rat’s arse as long as u pay your money to buy their meds… the industry has to thrive. Let me give u a small example … a small size hospital where I used to work… the admin of that hospital said we gotta make 100,000 dollors business at the end of this week. If a small hospital can be so ambitious then don’t you think the psych hospitals and other hospitals that are run like 5 star hospitals won’t want their business to get hurt by allowing for cheaper medicines? Which are already available but being denied big time in the USA."
176177499,"Why are you looking for a therapist? If “they” are doing it? This is not to say by any means that you shouldn’t engage a therapist. You should, but my point is that you fundamentally recognize it is the illness. That is the first part of the treatment process."
176177500,"Ah yes I remember when I first left therapy it took me about a month to transition, then I was fine for a few years. Before I left, my counsellor connected me to some resources in the community and recommended some books. At first a felt a little lost, but it got easier over time. I did end up going back to him a few years later, but for a whole new set of reasons. You’ll be okay."

176177502,"Has anyone ever experienced micro aggression? Example “Like, where are you really from?” My most recent MA, is kind of funny. My new neighbors somehow found out everything they wanted to know about us through their old neighbors. This neighbor then comes up to me and asked where we were both from and then says “I knew one of y’all wasn’t from here.” I then told her about my beautiful country Asgard and our King _PERSON_…lol but seriously things like this bother me, I’m just trying to live my life and people assume I’m a certain way because of a stereotype. I brought it up as a symptom because these things ruminate through my mind. Whatever intrusive thoughts come up it’s mostly what I hear. I hear the voices say “See, you don’t belong, You’re a loser, You’re inferior.” And the thoughts and voices drill these things into my mind. I wake up hoping they don’t bring those phrases up. It hurts my feelings."

But, i used my rewards card to get a 25 dollar chilis gift card. I hadnt eaten a good meal in weeks and i was so excited to use my gift card and eat 25 dollars worth of food. The night before i was gonna use it i was excited thinking about the food i was gonna eat. Then a thought in my mind crept up telling me to throw the card away and not eat the food because if i did use the gift card it would cause my grandmother to die. For a few minutes my heart started beating fast and it felt like it did ten years ago when the magical thinking like this was almost constant and much more severe, making me do things i didnt want to do or really wanted/needed to do but couldnt because i thought something really bad would happen. In the morning i hurried up and used my gift card as soon as they opened and quickly ate the food 
before any magical thinking returned. It felt so good with the food in my belly."

174387658,So my ex is a narcissist and he is emotionally abusive and that’s why I divorced him to get away. Well even though I have divorced him and got away he uses our kids a pawns to find a way to stress me out which I dont do well with stress because of my illness. He calls me constantly telling me we need to coparent and be able to talk he constantly berates me about the kids. He tells me he dont like the way they dress and he tells me the kids are dirty. I know this is untrue because my kids are clean and they have nice clothes. He just wont leave me alone my kids are very well tooken care of. Plus my son is a straight a b student and I put my daughter in early education. They get practically anything they want and they have alot of friends and family. He calls me telling me he will have someone do a wellness check on me and the kids and have them tooken away from me because he says my place is dirty. My place is not dirty I have two young kids that likes to spill things on very light carpet and I hav
e been living in an apartment for over two years and my daughter is into everything she likes to experiment and she writes on things and spills stuff. Besides from my carpet not being replaced and damaged my apartment is clean and I’m looking to save up and move within the year. This man will not leave me alone he only sees his kids sometimes on sunday for a couple hours and I may once in a blue moon get him to have them for two days so far. Mind you this same man who signed a contract with me for 5050 custody and has it motorized. Told me it wont stand in court that he signed a contract with me for custody. Constantly threatens me and then says hes not threatening me berates me about the kids all the time and wont leave me alone saying they ate dirty and not up kept which isnt true. I finally found a way to get rid of him and for him not to say anything to me anymore. First I have to make sure my daughters hair is freshly done when going to him and my son has a fresh hair cut. Then I have to turn around an
d buy new clothes for the time that he does see them because all the clothes that he bought them and I bought them arent good enough. Buy them shoes that they dont wear unless they are going to there father for a couple hours on sunday. Then I wont have the endless threats of having dss called on me being told that I am disabled and I would never win a custody battle even though he signed a custody agreement with me for 5050 custody which we arent doing because he only sees them sometimes on Sunday for a couple hours and and because what he signed wont stand up I’m court. I have to make sure my kids are brand new flashy and clean just to get my freedom and not have anymore stress or anything said to me or about me. Mind you my kids are smart intelligent and thriving in life with me being single mother with paranoid schizophrenia. But I will do this to get rid of this narcissist that wont let me go he wont have no more power over me to say anything to me and about me.

I hear stuff stuck on repeat, and if I’m not stable even after meds that are supposed to work, I’ll hear stuff that hinders my drawing abilities and thoughts in my head. Those ones aren’t as loud. I had a long car trip and I kept hearing on Thursday, the woman who I was with was sitting in the back seat talking to herself, and then when I looked back she wasn’t. Then I blocked my ears without music in my headphones and her singing along. So my voices are all different sorts of loudness, and making sense. Too much stimulation makes them so much worse"

176177641,"You could have ptsd from delusions. I don’t know. My therapist never tells me straight up i have ptsd. She said stuff like “do you think it’s because you have ptsd?” And I say “I think generally it would be that way if because someone has ptsd”. But I take the focus away from myself. I don’t care if I have ptsd or not too much. A diagnosis or not is not gonna take away or add to my struggles. It is what it is. And only god can judge me not a diagnosis. But I wonder sometimes if I have ptsd. Seems the more I try to run away from it, it always comes back. And when I work on it it helps a bit. Emdr usually helps. Once we did too much and it made me depressed and all the ptsd symptoms became even more apparent than usual. But most the time it works. And I think I’ll always have memories. But they don’t bother me as much as they used to which is good."
174387665,"Ugh just suffering over this makes my hallucinations reappear. I was fine most of the day. I guess that in reality this is me trying to compensate for regret that I feel over wasting best years of my life and ruiningy career over self delusions. I guess just being susceptible is enough to “catch” schizophrenia from someone else if delusions somehow mesh, and then the delusions just evolve on their own. Having exact precedent would give me closure however."

For example: When I was psychotic I was feeling and having an urge to send air kisses to one girl who lived in one of my neighbouring houses and was hissing at neighbour who always were making me uncomfortable. One strange thing happened when I was psychotic that one Friday night, like 4am I was just wandering around a town and I suddenly saw a girl and felt I’m being pulled and we started seriously making out. I also could feel if someone was approaching me. Do you think it is something supernatural that we have when we are psychotic like 6th sense or heightened senses or just plain crazy?"

I’ll often switch to tea which has some health benefits but still the caffeine… How much are you drinking a day? It can be dangerous high doses.

176177750,"no, my point was actually that none of my SSRI symptoms were serious. I got my GP to assess them all and they were all fine. My point was meant to be that our anxiety can stop us from identifying serious medical issues from un-seroius ones and the only way to calm the anxiety/stress about it is to have the matter assessed by a GP."

176177754,So after my walk I went to the bathroom a little bit and there was blood in my stool again. The last 5 - 6 times I went there wasn’t any blood and now it pops back up again. I wiped myself and there was blood on the toilet paper as well. I went to the GI and he only talked me be for a minute and has scheduled a colonoscopy. I’m super worried and hoping this problem can be resolved somehow. I’ve been stable for more than a year and this combination of medications is working really well for me so I’m hoping I don’t have to change medications. I’ve been drinking the prune juice mixed with apple juice and it hasn’t been helping either. I’ve been drinking 2 - 3 liters of water everyday and excercise 3 - 4 days a week. I feel so stuck and down about this because I’ve made so much progress.
176177755,Except those times when I’m not
176177756,I was wondering if anybody else had breakdown symptoms like me.The breakdown symptoms are when I get real bad I think I’m in hell and I think the TV is talking about me or people can read my mind especially my family. It can get real scary real fast I don’t want to go into all of it but it can. So my doctor gives me paliperdone 3 mg pills.she told me to take one but I told her the truth one time when I was in her office that I had to take four to get me right because on my invega shot it’s 12 mg a day so that would be four pills. I don’t know if that was the right thing to do or not because now she only gave me seven pills last month or the month before and won’t give me a lot.my question is this time when I go in should I tell her I only took one or should I tell her the truth that I still have to take four to get me right because my invega shot is 12 mg a day it only makes sense to take 3 mg pills four of them to get right on. What should I do?
176177757,"have a nice day, its raining here"
176177758,"My one job I’ve had since psychosis (fast food, bleh) started off fine but as time passed I got more and more paranoid regarding the motives and opinions of my coworkers and eventually I gave in and quit before the stress triggered a relapse.

174387705,Work and its stressors is another thing. You may feel like you can work but when it comes down to it you struggle. I’m like that. I do pretty well but when I work the stress eats away at me till I get paranoid. I do volunteering to keep me active but I’ve no desire to mess with work.
176177773,"Thanks. You have the same symptoms I do, except I can’t say I get extremely low. I was suicidal in 2019, and my pdoc put me on an antidepressant."

I had a destructive behaviour and did not enjoy it. I really just wanted intimacy and love making with a steady partner. Last person I had sex with was my x boyfriend around March or April I think.

176177817,"unfortunately weight gain seems to be a side effect all of us have to deal with here _AT_MENTION_ . I only get weighed every 6 months at the doctor so it makes me anxious not knowing if I’ve gained weight for months. I’ve managed to maintain a stable, healthy weight for the last 6 months.

Then I inquired about the dosage of the CBD to a health professional and he explained it very well. One of my friends asked me to inquire about it as he has been suffering from psychosis. The professional told that CBD is safe, well-tolerated, and may have antipsychotic effects in patients with psychosis, But it depends on the physical condition of patients. If we're trying CBD, it’s best to start with a smaller dosage and gradually increase it, what I mean by starting with 5 to 10 mg a day and after a week, increase this amount by 3 mg. I believe it'll be helpful for you."

I then went to my clubhouse and attended a spread the word meeting and wrote a bit about the games cafe that we went to play games. I then went to the games cafe and had a mocha but it was too sweet but i had a look at the cards and was asking about what to get as a beginner to Magic the gathering, i ended up spending £12 on 35 new cards 2 50 card protectors and a box for cards, i got 25 free mana cards too, i thought it was very cool because there was a guy who wanted to see my cards bc he was curious and he ended up explaining all the cards i got which was great, so i am hopefully either going to get my friend to play with me at it or just go to one of their beginner events,"

I am just here in my bed, worrying, and all this is accompanied with physical symptoms - weakness in my legs, tight stomach, impossibility to move cause too scared. Its like this. But the aps never helped me and the bigger doses make me just crazier. Its not that they don’t help, its worse than that - they make me crazier… So i’ll try just 7,5 mg of Zyprexa now, not the 10 mgs, but I am not sure my will be strong enough to help my fears… But I fight believe me. I go out now a bit more than before, but I still have fears… I don’t know why the aps never relieved my fears, its strange, no?"

176177872,That is tough for me to say because I have always struggled with symptoms. My first major episode was when I was 16 though. And looking back I had a period of time between 12-13 where I became deeply depressed and completely withdrew socially and strangely lost my ability to communicate well like I just didn’t know how to make conversation anymore it was challenging and I went from being fairly popular to very socially awkward. I think if I did have a prodromal phase that could have been it. I didn’t recover my communication skills for years. Not until college.

I may have bi-polar as well so it is the right medicine in theory. Agent I can really relate to what you are saying but find it a little disheartening. I can’t imagine living like this forever.

176177891,Try to keep your mind occupied and applied to a task. The more you stay busy the better your performance and less time for frivolous thought you will find. Also understand that your symptomatic thoughts apply to the same area of your brain as free/random thoughts. the only difference is you are appropriating an emotion to the processing of the thought which is making it stand out. The best way to combat it is to let it flow and go as freely as it came. You can accomplish this by redirecting your focus on a task at hand or finding a new task to affix your attention too. If that doesnt work you can always search for your happy place and develop thoughts surrounding that depiction. You could also keep a song stuck in your mind and play and sing it out simultaniously with your imagination in efforts to avoid the bad thought from manifesting as center in your mind. good luck

174387743,"Whether it is a delusion or reality I cannot tell, because considering the symptoms it is impossible to tell whether it is a spiritual possession or something the brain has composed/revealed (unless you believe that spiritual possession is only fiction). The reality is, that an entirely new character is now in control of my body. That character seems to be in part composed of how I used to act (it walks and does a few things just as I would have done), and in part entirely new behaviour. That new behaviour does not follow common reason, and can be split into three types: Sometimes the purpose why it does certain moves or actions is unknown, such as, without any thought or emotion being behind it, threatening to kill me or my relatives, (verbally, as a fake concept/thought in my mind, or a combination of the previous and a physical movement towards completing that action - like me suddenly going to the next room to take two metal bars which I could then stick in the wall socket), or doing some of th
is: Do you see any logical purpose to do any of this? At other times the “condition” apparently wants to prove that I’m possessed by a spirit. An example of this is voices just now telling me “We’re now going to show you are possessed by a spirit.” and me suddenly standing up to jump up and down, flapping my hands like wings. Finally there is something the voices call the “program”. This supposedly controls all of the symptoms. Part of its doing is creating a VERY STRONG AND BAD feeling (seemingly physical, worse than pain) in my body (which the voices rightly call torture) forcing this “spirit” to pretty much jump out of the bed to go walking, because that is the only remedy to it, excluding a few other actions the voices consider important - that “program” is intelligent enough to recognize them and then limit the amount of torture it applies to me, or removes it completely, and that change happens pretty quickly. Yet another unreasonable behaviour - why would it force me to walk all 
day long is beyond me. And over time it increased the amount of torture it applied, even during walking . Regarding the brain composing things, do you see any random glitch or chemical imbalance in the brain to create such intelligent and bad (or evil , even) activity? Luckily, for now, that period is over, and now I just lie in the bed. The inconvenience is not entirely over, though. Now I still feel bad sensations in my head and body as I mentioned in my first post, at times, and they, too, disappear (sometimes temporarily) when doing certain actions."

I feel demoralized reading all the research articles about long DUP (duration of untreated psychosis) correlating with lower chances of full recovery and bad outcomes. I reached a medication plateau and it didn’t get better after that. Is there any hope for a full recovery for people like me who had their sickness treated late?

176177964,Unless you told your doc lies when talking about what was troubling you I don’t think you have self diagnosed.

174387744,"I have found on other groups a lot of people say they smoke weed for their schizophrenia. But I don’t want to get high or get paranoid. I used to smoke weed all the time, and it got rid of my hallucinations and made me more social. I read that it can help by rewiring the nerves and neuronal impulses in the brain; so if I did it the right way, I basically was smoking weed for the sole purpose of healing my psychosis and it worked. I still am free of hallucinations and delusions for the most part. I take 10mgs Abilify now. I ordered some CBD because I smoked some cbd hemp flower and found it put me in a good mood and I felt lifted. Well I ordered a whole bunch of CBD. I Hope it helps me with the depression, although I may end up stopping abilify if its more effective. I’m writing this because I’m a little nervous that its not mainstream treatment, but I have a feeling it could even cure me. So I have CMT also, _NAME_, nerve pain and tinnitus. They all seem linked. My symptoms started with ringi
ng ears and seizure like symptoms. Is it possible that the tissue and white matter around my nerves in my brain are also wearing thin just like around the muscles in my arms and legs? Is CMT a factor in schizophrenia? Maybe pain, stress, and seizures are all linked to the wearing thin of tissue and grey matter in all the muscles not just my legs and arms and that if I can learn to repair the nerve connections i can heal and cure my mental illness? Doing that would involve taking vitamins and smoking herbs that help with antioxidents to reduce oxidative stress Yoga, music therapy and biofeedback. Just having confidence in my own recovery and will power has been enough to help heal my mind body and spirit."

I try to help with homework, but I can’t even do the work my 2 middle schoolers are doing. _NAME_ is 7th grade but in advanced math, so she did _PERSON_’s 8th grade math for him yesterday. I used my laptop to find the answers to _NAME_’s English reading assignments, I dead ass cheated and found the answers for the whole book she was to read. There’s a reason she didn’t read it, she was on a week trip up northern WI for school and the day she got back we got the state lockdown order, so school was done from March 13-April 6th. She had no idea what work to do or anything, so yes, I am cheating to get my kids to pass this year. Online school is ????. My oldest is in 9th grade and we found out he was failing all classes because his google what the ???? ever thing wasn’t getting the assignments sent 
to him, so he thought he was doing right by doing the video work each day, so we’re catching up on a ??????? month. And now we get told by the school we have to go out and buy all the parts needed for his robotics engineering class, we’re talking 300 dollars. I told the school to shove that up their ass.

It was only moving here and support from my stepdaughter along with a less blinkered , and more intelligent pdoc , that got me the _PERSON_’s dx . Ignoring my concerns was par for the course with my previous mental health team. They saw character assassination as a useful therapeutic tool. It’s too late for me , too much water has flowed under the bridge, but I hope you can get the help and support you need before it’s too late ."
174387749,"I dont really hear voices, and there never seems to be a pattern to why/when i do hear voices. You don’t need to hear voices to feel exhausted mentally and just stare at a wall/stay in bed. But i think _AT_MENTION_ was spot on. If you’re voices and quality of life are suffering you need a med change, probably clozaril is a good idea. Usually you need to be in hospital to get onto clozaril. Also if the suicidal ideation worsens you should consider hospitalization as its important you stay safe. If that doesn’t sound like something you want to do, i really think you should call your pdoc/see him as soon as you can."

174387757,I think the danger is when you’ve been on another AP for some time that blocks dopamine and then go on abilify which kind of modulates dopamine you can possibly go psychotic from it. Having said that I was on seroquel for ages and switched to abilify without a problem.

It’s not possible that saying a prayer the wrong way would cause bad things to happen. I know it feels like it could, but it’s impossible. I dont know if that falls under the same category, but it sounds like a sub category of apophenia. Again, if it makes you feel better then that’s fine, but if it becomes a problem for you then talk to your treatment team about it. Just remember that any connection between 666 and bad things is just coincidence. Did you know that 666 doesn’t have any connection to evil or the devil anyways? Numbers are powerless on their own.

I connected with a few high school friends of mine (Post- psychosis) and ask them if they had that question ask to them. 3 of them said yes, one of them is my roomate. Non of these people have any form a severe mental illness. So it’s a very strange rigmarole. I am not trying to undermine you in anyway but it’s strange how a few of my friends remember being asked the same question. They just weren’t asked it as often as I was.

176178055,"Well I always considered Taurus my most friend-prone sign. I’ve had many friends a Taurus Maybe cuz I’m so stubborn myself and don’t put up with ???????? long term , maybe that’s why. Taurus set clear/good boundaries I like to know peoples boundaries straight up no guessing So I like the bull sign."
174387768,Not me and not all SZs are like me. It all depends on SZ severity and negative symptoms severity. I only have 2 remaining friends from when I was on Abilify. We only talk online and never in real life.
176178056,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_. I hope it gets easier on you
176178057,I’m so sorry! Do you take your meds?
176178058,"So I read the next five pages of the first chapter for a fifth time just now and took some notes. I will finish the chapter tomorrow after which there will be two days left, not enough time to read the chapter for a sixth time completely. I might read it a sixth time though, taking up the first day of the new month, before moving on to chapter two. If I can keep this up for a year, I’m sure I’ll master the text. Thank you."

176178060,"If my therapist happened to read this, she would not answer your question but rather ask you whether or not these thoughts were helpful."
176178061,"Someone in my body, and unbearable thoughts, embarrassing and messsed up don’t want to be like this I am not like this. I am going to get better soon."
176178062,What dose worked for you? What did it do?
176178063,"Yes, but the best he wrote, was his diaries “Inferno” and the sequel. “Inferno” is a description of his mental breakdown in Paris, 189? ."
174387775,"I got the reaction, when telling my boss I have schizophrenia, that he thought I “was just a quiet guy”. Nope I used to talk a lot more but now I can’t think of anything to talk about. Poverty of speech and thought is what they call that."
176178064,"Despite my getting bigger and bigger every day, there is no doubt that I am pretty healthy for my age (59). I practice piano for an hour every day and practice yoga for about a half hour every day as well. I try to eat healthy and I get enough sleep every day/night. I meditate for about a half hour a day too. And I pray morning and evening. All of these things contribute to my good physical, mental and spiritual health."
176178065,"I take my pills before bed because they make me drowsy, but if I take them too early I fall asleep for like a short while wake up and its like, what come on you made me tired, just keep sleeping!"
176178066,"Yeah I probabably have moments everyday. Somedays longer than others. Other symptoms as well. Im used to it to some degree, but its pretty harsh."
174387773,"I hope I will have the willpower again, cos I have gained over 25 kgs since schizophrenia onset and antipsychotics"
176178067,"Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Taking meds? I feel like you probably should. Weird coincidences Do happen all the time, most people can move past them and not overthink. The world is not out to get you."
174387760,"I really don't mind who knows that I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2016 because øFour years later I have my schizophrenia under absolute 100% control and I don't think I have EVER felt more in love with who I am than I do today and I'd say the main reason for that is that my schizophrenia diagnosis forced me into intense therapeutic situations involving classrooms full of others suffering not just like me but suffering just the same. I was FORCED to sit for an hour a week talking to a bland woman that I did not like one bit. She had little to say but ""Try DBT"" (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) which I ended up being forced into anyway when I got caught drinking on probation. I've peed in a cup far, far, FAR too many times for me care anymore and yet still I did. Every damn time I had to do it I felt humiliated and those ladies who have to watch you pee, while they are wearing gloves it is still disgusting to have to spend the morning smelling the pee of 100 other people and having to handle 
it... ew. I was FORCED out of my nearly 10 year hibernation with my voices because my voices literally overnight turned from angels & Gods speaking of life, love & all things good about the universe ? (Let me repeat that this change literally happened over the course of a single day. I knew I was schizophrenic the moment I heard the 1st voice back in 2008 but it said ""Turn left"" while I was walking around Oak Lake by myself and no one anywhere near me. I can't explain why I chose to follow but I did indeed turn left and I can explain the magically warm and tingling sensation that over came my whole body, mind & soul it felt the moment I turned left. That's how I felt with my voices from 2008-2016 and it was incredible! I felt like I was talking to the Gods because the voices were NEVER anything negative for eight blissful years.) Suddenly, on 4/20/2016 I woke up to a voice I was VERY familiar with for about the past four years. He started getting pushy in his instruction meaning NEVER in my schizophrenic pa
st or present do I EVER feel compelled to do anything more than simply talk to my voices (which I still get despite medication to this day) because never since that first day have I been instructed by them. They just talked and I just listened and sometimes talked back when I was alone but never in front of anyone. I heard literally hundreds of voices and was able to hide it from _NAME_ although near the end he suspected something was wrong but he incorrectly thought I was abusing massive amounts of drugs and alcohol and that was the reason for my erratic behavior. 2016 started and ended with me in the loving arms of my husband and children but April to August was probably the worst & best months of my entire life. I was homeless on the streets of _NAME_, Nebraska for the month of June while I waited for a bed to open up in the People's City Mission and spent another month in a room with 20 other women. I don't want to talk about how it happened right now and you'll see why in a minute. The short version is t
he voices became pushy and I had multiple miniature blackouts over the course of the day once while driving which scared me but at the time I didn't realize that anything was changing because it was happening so fast that I just thought I was having a really REALY bad day. I spent the entire day avoiding everyone and everything which only made things about 1,000 times worse because apparently socialization... true socializing where you put down your phone, look each other in the eye, and have a heart felt conversation about anything that floats your boat as long as you stay 100% connected with the person you are communicating with... it truly helps. But I secluded myself and for the first time in all my years of working no call, no showed at work leaving my elderly charge to have to call for someone else to come get him out of his wheelchair and into bed for the night. That's the last thing I remember about that night with absolute clarity. From that moment on I was at the whim of this voice who once was kind
, funny & charming but was now not so kind. I woke up from a dream involving _NAME_ doing some of the most terrible things imaginable and I can remember waking up SUPER angry because the emotions of my dream had not yet subsided and just like that morning when I woke up the first voice that I heard was not my sweet husband's but none other than Lucifer himself. It isn't fair to be possessed by a demon and that is exactly what it felt like. I felt like a puppeteer had the strings to my body and brain and someone else with sinister intentions had the controls because everyone who knows me knows that I am not now nor have I EVER been a violent or aggressive person but something in me snapped that day and for a really long time I was not right with myself which meant I was not right for anyone else including my husband & children. I can't say that I shouldn't have been punished for what I did that night but the city of _NAME_, Nebraska can't even begin to understand the severity of the punishment I ultimately rec
ieved for going into a schizophrenic blackout and punching my poor husband right in the mouth. I should have been put in a hospital and instead was thrown in jail where I recieved no help whatsoever no matter how many days in a row I told them that I needed to see a doctor. When my sister bailed me out being with family helped some but I freaked out on her and scared her so bad that she kicked me out. I didn't want to burden anyone else and didn't even think that I HAD anyone else so I wandered the streets of _NAME_ for three whole days and nights before I became vaguely aware that lack of sleep was causing me to hallucinate but I didn't have a bed and it was the first time in my life that I didn't have a bed so I didn't know what to do. I was walking nonstop and had huge blisters across the entire pads of my feet because I just didnt know what else to do besides walk. I sat down on the front steps to an apartment building and the next thing I knew it was night. I don't know why I didn't get to the hospital b
ecause I knew I needed help. I think I was scared to lose the only entities that I had left to interact with even if they were imagined. I did eventually get to the hospital where I was immediately diagnosed and medicated. I've spent the last three years recovering from being ripped away from the only family or friends I had in my life at the time. I was completely alone and had no means to provide for ANY of my own needs and had no one to protect and provide for me. In any case I got home and while I had my husband and children and less voices I truly felt that I had no friends. I did it to myself beginning when I dropped my whole of everything here in _NAME_, Nebraska to spend six years raising children alone with no friends or family because I was so crazy busy raising babies and loving my husband during the few moments here and there that he wasn't deployed that I had time enough to make maybe three good friends that I still have to this day and two of those were _NAME_ friends. I just don't find people q
uickly or easily. Well about a year ago I decided that I am not letting myself be alone anymore. If I like you and think that you are a good person, I want to spend more time with you. I apologize to the people that I know I am going to ghost because I don't want you in my life but it is my ??????? life not yours and if you want to spend ANY time in mine you should probably listen when I speak because I have been ignored in this world for far too ??????? long to want to play games with MY LIFE. I have spent 40 years being beat the ???? down and I have brought my own self back up all on my Goddamned own and I won't have anyone else force me into such a submissive and unhappy state of mind for as long as I have the state of mind to fight of parasitic people... parasitic entities... parasitic f u c k I n g anyone or anything with nothing to offer and desires only ever to take. I just didn't have it in my heart to love so hard anymore and that deeply saddened me. I needed a severe and desperate change not in myse
lf or how I behaved but in how other people behaved towards me. I need 100% beyond total acceptance of me for who I am in 2020 and I just happen to love everything about myself INCLUDING the fact that I am schizophrenic. I know it sounds crazy to say that I like being schizophrenic but here's the deal. If I DON'T love everything about myself including the schizophrenia I am depressed and beyond disappointed and completely unhappy. I am hopelessly interested in psychology and due to my diagnosis I am in a unique position where I can and am offering society one of the most intense submersions in to the mind of a schizophrenic that I can produce with the mind of a schizophrenic. I love the study of psychology and scores no less than an A+ in every psychology course that I took in college. I'm far from stupid and while I have absolutely no idea exactly what I am doing I know in my heart that while the road has been riddled with potholes and speed bumps that the end of that terribly abused and neglected road is ri
ght in front of me and I think I'm going to turn left."
176178068,"See I ask that because I used to get all sorts of hallucinations when the fan was running. music would be playing and I would hear arguments. Then I would turn the fan off, and it would be silent again. I’m not sure why that happened. Can you do an experiment and try turning it off for a bit so you don’t think things are catching on fire?"
176178069,My psychiatrist told me that sz can cause memory and concentration issues. They’re called cognitive symptoms and there is no meds to treat them.
176178070,Breathing helps. It is like a way to bring ur focus on something away from anxiety a bit. Temporarily…

176178076,"My new voice, _NAME_, made his debut by telling me the tap water came from the toilet and that my best friend was gonna put pills in the food to mellow me out."
176178077,"This is what I think needs to be managed. We are now a movement. We are growing effectiveness. I see this truth in several of the recent posts. But also lately I see a profound anger and propensity to want to exact revenge on those who (may have) harmed us over years, lifetimes. The management I was referring to is that we need to assuage our powerful need for revenge and have some mercy. There may be justice, but we need a little discipline of this revenge emotion. We now need light on revenge."
176178078,I think it just makes you more aware of it. Its up to you to manage it accordingly

Fortunately the student grade ones are not bad! so I will continue getting those. but the thing is that paintbrushes are expensive, I have artist grade ones,so when they wear out I would have to spend a mini fortune,trying to look after them as best as I can but there is only so much one can do.

174387776,"Let’s try to reflect in a positive way in this thread! What are your GOOD memories that you’ve had since developing schizophrenia? What fortunate things have happened to you since that you are grateful for, despite whatever happens? Here are a few of mine: -My favorite memory of all, of getting engaged at the Grand Canyon at sunrise. No one else was there but us, it was spontaneous but he happened to have a wooden ring from a friend in his pocket. He first asked if my parents would mind if he proposed! I had to ask him, “are you proposing to me?” and he smiled and I said “yes! YES!”, jumped into his arms and he spun me around. -Seeing how happy my husband was on his first international trip to Indonesia, the awe in his face and his eyes. -Buying my first diamond dove, I’d always thoughts birds were awesome but never dreamed of having a bird of my own (he eventually flew out the window hehe poor guy in all seriousness I was really sad) -Seeing the first spring flowers in the dry desert

176178109,It varies… My first delusions started from a genuinely scary situation that lasted too long for me to cope (years). Emotionally i just collapsed. I felt overwhelmed by instinctual fear for my child and my flight/fight/freeze response was full on with no way to act on it. Mind switched to a higher level of “flight”. Cognitively someone had literally been driving me crazy on purpose (even told me he would do that). Telling me he would kidnap my son or come after us everywhere. That kind of fueled paranoia.
176178110,"I now came up with the following idea: I noticed that when I am on the internet, I can surf for a long time continuously, longer than desired and it obstructs my capacity to get things done. The solution: I want to start using a timer, a device that you can set time and after the time expires it emits a sound, such a timer can help me avoid spending too much time on the internet. I wanted to share it with you because it may help you as well as me."

176178169,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ , I have looots of paranoid thoughts sometimes, similar to your worries I found out I can ignore these thoughts if I just focus on my body, I mean, on the feeling of the weight of my body, while I walk, while I’m on a chair, while laying on the bed, etc. After a few seconds you can feel all your body, legs, arms, torso, neck, head, etc. For some reason, at least in my case this: 1.-Silences the voices and stops visual hallucinations 2.-Stops obsessive thoughts/paranoid thoughts/violent thoughts/negative thoughts in general A shaman taught me this, and he has also helped many other people teaching this same method to them So I’d encourage you to try it and see if it helps you when you feel like you are worrying too much or are scared or something With time, you still can perceive these thoughts but it is like you don’t really care about them anymore, they just don’t really matter anymore and you just focus on what you really want to do in a given moment"

176178172,"Help, please… Do I pace cause I was on lower dose for a month and now that I am back on a bigger one, I need time again? In fact, I do it only around people… The other theory is that I start to get more alive after being numbed both emotionally and intellectually from too many meds in the past… But the price is more social anxiety and the rest? I am mad to my mother tbh… She keeps saying, that ill be always ill and alone here at my house… She says her goal is that I cant take care of myself, but she doesn’t see me outside happy, no… But my pace is with strong anxiety and somatic sensations, yeap… I wonder if I need more meds now or I am just getting more alive from the numbness of the years and its a good thing in the end?"
176178173,"The interesting thing about the _PERSON_ effect, is that it affects a mass of people. These are not false personal memories, but a mass delusion of sorts I mostly put it down to pop culture, and it’s misinterpretation and misrepresentation of things. There may very well be examples that are more compelling, but that’s what it seems to be in general Another name for it might be common assumption"
176178174,No I haven’t tried it yet. Maybe I will if it gets worse. Thanks!
176178175,"Yeah. There are a lot of lies and liars in this world. We have to be careful about specific accusations, of course. Lying seems so wrong to me, especially when the person bring lied to has done nothing bad to the liar, because it seems to be an attempt to destructively manipulate another person’s mind, at their very core. But, we seem to live in a big machine that is built on such destructive manipulation. Even revealing some lies seems to lead to punishment, with the person bring seen as a troublemaker. As a religious person, I happen to believe that things will vastly improve some day, but I can’t talk about specifics here."

176178189,"Psychiatry is just a weird field to go into; I’ve met some pretty strange professionals in my life. But basically they are trained to be the sane ones, the voices of reason, but I’ve met counselors who I think to myself, “You are in the wrong field buddy (and women).” I’ve met disrespectful workers who are mean and sadistic to clients. I’ve seen workers who torment certain people to get a reaction from them and once the patient/client responds, they lay into them. Or I’ve seen the staff have huge egos and want to be adored by everyone, and it turns into a popularity contest between patients to see who he likes best. And the staff members have their little battles to be the most liked staff member by the patients. Hell, it actually seems kind of fun; I feel fine but I think I’ll drive to the nearest hospital to check myself in and let the fun times begin. IDK. Psychiatry is what we got so we have to put up with it."
176178190,"Oh sugar, yeah, just noticed. Damn FB feed."
176178191,"It’s not very smart to quit on your own. Work out your med problems with your doc. Like everybody knows, the biggest cause of relapse is going off your meds. Talk to the guy who went to college for 8 years to be a psychiatrist, he might know a little more about meds than you. If we all had a choice, none of us would take medication. But meds help. Maybe not perfectly, but they help."

176178195,"So yesterday I started having anxiety around my dad. I just felt uncomfortable with him around. It spiraled out of control and I started worrying about my car, empty beer cans in my car, babysitting for my sister, then eventually thinking I needed to go to the hospital. At one point I was laying in bed and my toes and legs kept tensing up. Has anyone ever felt that before? I also “heard” my dad go through my car and tell my mom he found beer cans. I also “heard” the cans get dumped out. But when I went to check everything was in the right place. I know I shouldn’t drink. I’m trying to get over that. But has anyone felt such intense anxiety and paranoia they tense up?"
176178196,Yes- my brother also has this. It’s so annoying.

176178205,"I’ll be really good I think. Vraylar has my vote. Wish I could share how I get it so inexpensively but I’m not well versed in pharmacy jargon. Caffeine ultimately caused what was not my finest hour. My bio I never changed; and it spoke about liking my own thoughts too much. Caffeine makes this even worse and leaves me without insight!! (Excited bc that’s the definite right thing to include). Not being needy, and I know the reality and don’t need to test it, and I’m not fishing for compliments. And I wasn’t seriously angry I don’t really think. I believe it stems from being nice and I ‘explode in good ways’ ; ). Someone once said that to me but the context wasn’t a happy one. Still I include it here for relaxation all around. This is hard bc I overthink… people say ‘just do you’ to me often. Either way the point here is I’d like to close my account.

176178278,"It seems that the meaning of words has been distorted in a way that the actual meaning of them is nearly lost. One such word people have poorly understood is: ego. Ego is interpreted in such a way that people assume it means something like: being ‘bad’ or ‘selfish’ or ‘prideful’. What it actually was meant to mean came from Jungian psychology which refers to something more like: a facade or pretense. In other words, being not true to yourself and what you really prefer/desire. Examples of this? Nearly everywhere and the effect is detrimental to society. It has nothing to do with selfishness/pride or anything absurd like that. Essentially, we become who we are not when we become concerned with staying close to a social group by rejecting a part of ourselves that is ‘not acceptable’ to our parents/employers/spouse/etc. So then, how could you be true to being you if a large part of you is rejected… by you? That is when we develop an ‘ego’ - a false identity - to keep closeness wi
th our present social groups. Why? Because facing rejection is far more painful - at least in the short-term. People concerned with doing ‘right’ based on social convention? Far more dangerous than being authentic. I say this because I was annoyed with being accused of stealing from Wal-_NAME_ by the receipt checker (THIS is ego) who of course proved to be wrong and only pissed me off more. It’s a small thing to many, but on a large scale it IS dangerous."

176178288,May be an aprn. My pdoc wanted me to go to a rehab or else he wouldn’t see me. But I wasn’t ready to go to a rehab. I may go anyways. But I had to get a new person to prescribe my meds for now. I hope they’re willing to give me 5 mg a month of klonopin. That’s about all I need. I literally microdose klonopin and take usually an 1/8th of a milligram maybe at most each morning. And it sets my really right. However in the hospital I was taking .5 a day. The substance I’m thinking of trying to quit helps me take less klonopin. But it’s not by a lot and it’s not really totally worth it. I’m gonna be very honest with the prescriber. About my needs. I have my therapist today and ultimately she will help me make a decision on rehab.

174387846,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Are trials of psychological and psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia and psychosis included in the NICE guidelines pragmatic? A systematic review. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, VJ Bird, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PloS one , 2019 The NICE clinical guidelines on psychosocial interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis in adults are based on the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which may not be studies with a pragmatic design, leading to uncertainty on applicability or recommendations to everyday clinical practice.To assess the level of pragmatism of the evidence used to develop the NICE guideline for psychosocial interventions in psychoses.We conducted a systematic and critical appraisal of RCTs used to develop the 'psychological therapy and psychosocial interventions' section of the NICE guideline on the treatment and management of psychosis and schizophrenia in adults, published in 2014. For each study we assessed pragmatism using the 
pragmatic-explanatory continuum indicator summary-2 (PRECIS-2) and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The mean score of PRECIS-2, averaging across nine domains, was calculated to describe the level of pragmatism of each individual study.A total of 143 studies were included in the analysis. Based on the PRECIS-2 tool, 16.8% were explanatory, 33.6% pragmatic, and 49.7% were rated in an intermediate category. Compared to explanatory studies, pragmatic studies showed a lower risk of bias. Additionally, pragmatism did not significantly improve over time, and no associations were found between pragmatism and a number of trial characteristics. However, studies with a UK leading investigator had the highest mean score of pragmatism. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), art therapy, family intervention, psychoeducation, and adherence therapy, showed the higher average pragmatism scores.Two third of studies used to produce NICE recommendations on psychosocial interventions for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis 
in adults are based on studies that did not employ a pragmatic design."

During my latest delusional period (mostly unmedicated, which lasted 2 or 3 years), I didn’t really hear people call me on it. I either thought they didn’t realise I was right, needed to see a dr themselves, had been tricked into the cover up or was part of it. I thought a lot of people were having me on, to be honest, and many conversations felt like things were implied in a “nudge, nudge, wink, wink” kind of way. It was so confusing. Anyway, what are your experiences? I was going to do a poll on this, but I’m not sure if I have the privilege to yet lol."

176178473,Unfortunately the mental health system is under pressure all over the world. It costs money to treat psychotics and I think there is some people who just use max dosing as a way to keep patients under control. As to it’s effectiveness you’ve probably proved that well beyond what is reasonable. It really takes a considered approach and that makes a good psydoc. We are people first.

I’m sort of like coming back alive in the year 2013. Age-regressed back to 23 years old or so. Back to the year 2013. I can move between other realities or parallel universes. Been to the future and back many times and outside the matrix. I figure I’m going to different timelines or worldlines. Same laws of physics but events change accounting to many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. I want it to stop. It’s like my mind is doing the time traveling and back into my younger schizophrenic body. Reality is weird since everything repeats the same perfectly from the big bang to the year 2013. Nothing changes at all like it’s set in stone. Deterministic to the core with no free will. Down to the atom or string. Things start to shift or change for me after 2013. It becomes noticeable after 2016. I figure I’m in an alien simulation but I believe in 
God. I was told the Illuminati is trapping me into this timeline on a loop. I was in the Montauk Project. Could be both groups. I could go on, but you get the point."

I will not attempt to lower my meds without her guidance. I will reduce my meds very slowly so I don’t experience rebound psychosis. The lowest I’ve been on Risperdal is 1.5 mg. This was years ago.

176178516,"I worry about that from time to time. I think some of the people in town are grousing about me getting a job. If it wasn’t for my back and for my med’s I would happily dig ditches, if that kind of work is available. I’m wondering if I could find some old man in declining health who has a neighborhood beautification business, but who is so decrepit he can’t do the physical work any more. There are a couple of problems with that, though. The first problem is that the med’s mess up my body’s temperature regulation mechanisms. I’m a lot more susceptible to hyperthermia in summer, and hypothermia in winter. If it was a perfect 60 degrees outside all year long I wouldn’t have that problem. The other problem is my back. Sometimes when I clean the restrooms at the clubhouse I’m getting to the limits of my tolerance for pain. It hurts. Of course, if I lost about 60 -75 lbs. that might go away. I do worry about them taking my disability away. If that happens I guess I’ll have to eat out o

Its a very difficult topic to talk about it. I lost my gf and suffered from hypersexuality for 9 years. My psychiatrist asked me many times if my sexuality was ok and I Iied saying its ok. It took me 9 years to tell him the truth. Its a good thing that you spoke about it because hyersexuality can make you do illegal things and even crimes sometimes like rape. Anyways, he changed my meds last year and no more hypersexuality."

I had this idea that god was monotoring my thoughts and Satan was putting thoughts of harm in my head. So I had to battle with this during sex. Needless to say I could not finish. So we just stopped having sex. I eventually was put on meds, but then the post schizophrenic depression set in and I could not find joy in my GF or anything else for that matter. So my last relationship was ruined by SZ. I was also put on an SSRI and that ruined it even more.

Also, I did not have TD when I was on Zyprexa in 1996-97. Turns out she was right. I had TD for about six weeks, but then it went away. It was the Haldol."

It’s easy to rail against the moderation but it’s pretty simple how it’s handled. You don’t proselytize and it’s all cool… You are just being so passive aggressive with this and it’s not warranted.

176178546,"If you don’t want to go to the hospital talk to your psychiatrist, or go into a walk in clinic and get the GP to prescribe you some antipsychotics. If your behavior is reasonable they probably wont have you taken to the hospital. But if you don’t get help soon your behavior might get bad enough that there will be a situation where you are forced to go to the hospital, as has happened to me countless times. So before you get worse get some meds or med adjustment. Maybe Seroquel would work, I have been given that in similar circumstances."
176178547,Taking sertraline gave me massive headaches to begin with. I was only on it for about 4 months. I think it took 2 or 3 weeks for the headaches to subside on the withdrawal. Good luck.

A sign there might be more going on than MI . Doing a swimming group where you’re more fixated on how many lengths you can do than interacting with the other patients.
176178551,"I watched a documentary that discussed the multiple world theory and showed a projection of human lives on a camera film. The camera film then multiplied to thousands of individual camera films to represent each different life story on one individual having made different decisions. This then multiplied to other people and put the maths in place to make it scientific with multiples of n. Watching other peoples lives unfold on a the film gave a perspective of the fourth dimension where time can be controlled, as you could pick these lives at any given time, forwards or backwards on their timeline. If you sat in the eternity of space and looked at the microfilms, is that who you suggest “you” are? I love this outlook."

176178561,"My immediate question on reading this was “just in adolescence?” And the answer seems to be yes - so long as you’re not exposed to THC until adulthood. If mice (and possibly humans) are exposed during adolescence, the effects persist. The team found that female mice with the FAAH variant showed an increased preference for the environment in which they’d been exposed to THC over a neutral environment when they were exposed to the substance during adolescence*, and the effect persisted into adulthood. However, if female mice with this variant were exposed to THC for the first time in adulthood, there was no increased preference for THC. These findings in mice parallel observations in humans that a select population of females are more sensitive to the effects of cannabis and demonstrate a quicker progression to cannabis dependence."
174387883,I used to take seroquel to sleep. Now I take clozapine.
174387895,I had a short course of treatment when I was mid 20s (now mid 40s). The benefit was short term and I didn’t really think it helped me with my problems which were losing my job and newly diagnosed schizophrenia (first time in hospital). They discharged me soon after (not sure if this was because they saw some difference or because they didn’t know what else to do with me). It did shift my mind from ruminating on magical things so I saw the reality of my situation (which was more depressing since I had no magic to make me happy).

Anyways, I am wondering if anyone can provide a link to describe the symptoms of this symptom of Schizophrenia?. This is the original post: I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia about 4 years ago, was hearing voices. Now those are gone and I am taking Paliperidone. When I am at work I experience this weird symptom that feels like I am being watched. My vision gets blurry and I really notice my surroundings. Other than that it’s really hard to explain, but thats how I feel. Does anyone know what this is?. Thanks in advance for any ideas or suggestions. UPDATE: I am taking Abilify now and still experience this symptom of Schizophrenia. It happens at work where there is alot of bright lights and goes away usually after I get home and sleep overnight. Thanks in advance for anyone who can provide me a link (PM me pleas
e) to what this symptom of Schizophrenia is called."

174387890,"I know I have been psychotic for some time now and after going back on my Geodon my therapist says she is starting to see me exhibit less negative symptoms. Things are brighter, like the t.v. Contrast got adjusted outside and I am noticing things I didn’t before. The voices aren’t screaming at me but got worse before I gotbetter. I was having tactile hallucinations and experiencing every symptom possible I think. I haven’t been well for a while. Then one day I received a message about my purpose and everything has been clear ever since. I feel I awakened a deeper part of my subconscious this year. I meditate a lot and I feel I opened my third eye chakra. Dissolved ego and fought a death that seemed so real, my neurons fired rapidly and with quick succession and tried to cling on to life and reality as I knew it. I found myself traveling through the astral plane and I was happy and free. I use the term “I” loosely here as I was not aware that I was me any longer as I had traveled outside o
f my body. During this time away from my body I found the source of the light, or truth. It came from every direction and had no shape. It was if the source of light reached out and touched my third eye and told me it wasn’t my time yet, I couldn’t return to source as I had a purpose. And it pushed me back to my body. I came to my physical form again repeating over and over I died, I died. Ever since (and it’s been months now) I have been putting the pieces together. I realize we are not humans with souls but rather souls in human bodies. I told my therapist if I were to expand on everything “I know” which would fill pages and I could write a book, to the outside world I would not be better. However, I feel fine. I feel lucid and I am able to function. I have my routines and things in check to keep me on track. It seems as if I am able to control the accusing and demanding voices now. I have learned to keep these thoughts to myself and not share bc of what people might think or say. Does anyone else 
backtrack all they do because they feel they will be judged harshly? I am just now opening up to people about my early childhood diagnosis. I am 39."

176178595,"As schizophrenics, we can take stuff to the ‘Nth’ degree. Some of what you describe is most likely happening…the rest should be discussed with your doctor before it spirals out of control. That punk kid 2 houses down cannot hear you inside of your apartment."

176178602,I do pretty well with the meds but I’ve always been pretty aggressive with trying things for better function. Before meds I had a lot of fear in my life. It ruled my life to a large extent. When diagnosed and I got a bit better I said to myself I’d never live with fear ruling my life ever again and that is why I tried a lot of things to get better function… Living with your fears isn’t easy but it’s worthwhile to try to alleviate them. I don’t think being honest really means hospital in most cases but it does mean your addressing some of your deeply held fears. I think asking for some help isn’t a bad thing. It takes time to get things right.

174387905,"It looks as if the Fanapt threads are zombie threads. Does anyone have any experience with Fanapt? Has anyone heard of any experiences with Fanapt? Does anyone have any serious thoughts on Fanapt? en.wikipedia.org Iloperidone Iloperidone, commonly known as Fanapt and previously known as Zomaril, is an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia. Iloperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, iloperidone demonstrated mild effectiveness. As effective as lurasidone, and 13 to 15% less effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug... It looks like it binds very tightly to an adrenaline receptor, and somewhat tightly to some dopamine receptors and a serotonin receptor. “Iloperidone has been shown to act as an antagonist at all tested receptors. It exhibits high (nM) affinity to serotonin 5HT2A (Ki value of 5.6 nM
), dopamine D2 (6.3 nM) and D3 (7.1 nM) and noradrenaline ?1 receptors (0.36 nM) [2] , moderate affinity for dopamine D4 (25 nM), serotonin 5HT6 (43 nM), 5HT7 (22 nM), and low affinity for the serotonin 5HT1A (168 nM), dopamine D1 and histamine H1 receptors.” So, it looks like it is the opposite direction from where I wanted go initially. I wanted to maintain high specificity to dopamine or just one receptor, instead of 3 receptors. But, since I’ve been on 1 mg of Haldol and functioned in full time jobs for about 6 years, maybe my psychiatrist would consider a very low dose of Fanapt, like 1 mg or something. Maybe this new sort of shotgun approach to receptors may turn out to be better in some ways."

Increasing antipsychotics' doses in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients is the most common intervention used by clinicians. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic, which in a number of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies has been found to be more effective than haloperidol for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. During the last few y
ears there have been several reports of successful results in prescribing olanzapine at dosages of more than 25 mg/day for treatment-resistant schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. This report presents the results from the treatment of three resistant schizophrenic patients treated successfully with high dosages of olanzapine (35, 40, and 60 mg/day). None of the patients had any side effects, including abnormal laboratory levels and weight gain. The results and literature data suggest that in clinical practice some schizophrenic patients resistant to conventional neuroleptic treatment and not responding to olanzapine at recommended dosages as high as 20 mg/day may respond to higher dosages such as 40 or 60 mg/day, and these dosages are well tolerated.

Well, I put those clothes in the dryer with all my other clothes and now I feel like everything is dirty. I’m paranoid that all my clothes are now dirty and I have to wear them and the whole thing is making me feel awful and disgusted. I’m not sure what I will do. I will probably wear my clothes but won’t put them in my drawers so then I won’t feel like my drawers are contaminated with the dirt. The dirt isn’t visible, but it makes my skin crawl. I feel like I’m going to contaminate everything around the house by wearing dirty clothes. Anyone have any advice?

Then when I was about 22/23, I started getting ill again, and I noticed I had Schizophrenia after two weeks locked in the psych ward when I asked the doctor why they were keeping me there.

176178739,"I never liked clonazepam from the beginning, I started taking it prn in 14’, and the drowsiness caused me to feel way too calm because I never really needed it, I just needed it to get rid of nightmares and sleep through the night. Then a couple psychotic episodes later, my former pdocs (4 pdocs) started to prescribe it daily, and never questioned it. Then my therapist I’ve been seeing for over a yr kept me on it, and same with my case managers. I never saw the therapeutic benefit until the withdrawals happen, then you think something is wrong with you, when that something wrong wasn’t even there before you started it, so its a rebound effect from the withdrawal. I’m finding l-theanine in replace of klonopin is better, it doesn’t gravely effect memory, and focus. I can actually be in a car, and read street signs, look at traffic, and feel the speed of the car. That’s how bad of what 5 yrs of klonopin did to me!

Try not looking at people’s faults, I know it’s hard and you have a picture of someone in your head but sometimes different is good. Not everyone fits in a box. That’s what happens to me, if someone psychologically takes ahold of me, whether it be when I was in school or an art class, I isolate because I look out for my sanity and well being. But I think just because someone gives you the impression they are 15, you should give them a chance. I try giving everyone a chance anymore. My next case manager- I thought she talked to spirits.

Non animal machines dont bleed blood because they have no need to recieve oxygen and nutrients through it to burn as energy. non animal machines recieve energy in other ways

176178812,"I don’t have anybody. Nobody accepts me because of my homicidal urges / violent tendencies and my anger and rage that I feel constantly everyday. Plus I don’t have any girlfriends. I’ve been kicked out just about everywhere else and this is the only place that I know of. I can’t get any help. I only see my counselor once a month at best because she’s the only person who works there and there’s no other places available that’ll accept me in as a patient. And I can’t see a therapist as that would be too expensive for my shitty medicaid insurance. If I tell counselors anything I’m afraid that they’re gonna baker act me again, so I end up telling them nothing and I receive no help. My mom essentially lives off my disability money and has no job, but when I told my counselor about this she said that it couldn’t be transferred in my name because I didn’t know how to budget even though my family never gives me any money to practice budgeting with. I don’t have a bank account eith
er, so I constantly have to bum them for ???? and listen to them ????? and moan at me for asking them when they don’t take me to get a job or anything. My counselor holds me responsible for everything and that’s why I ??????? hate her ass. At this point there isn’t anything I haven’t tried short of going homeless. There’s no way that I’m going to move out of here. Plus nobody else in my family has any room for me to move in nor do I have any friends. My life sucks. It just gets worse everyday.

But yeah. I don’t even talk to people most of the time, I just stick to myself. I’m not chatty anymore. I used to be able to speak about interests, but I don’t have the interest to speak about things I don’t gain from so I just keep quiet in social situations. I’m a friendly person though. I always try to stay positive and be hopeful and kind and smiley in general. So I’m not unapproachable. Life’s just weird man. After sz hits. I do see improvement though.

176178829,"Honestly after our last session she was saying that if I commit myself to my drawings and art I would no longer need to see a therapist. I think it was her way of saying that it’s difficult to apply therapy on someone who suffers from schizophrenia/SZA and I’d be better off at trying to carve out my own happiness pursuing my hobbies instead of listening to a therapist. Just a hunch but I think she knew that I was no longer going to see her and it was her way of sending me a final message. I am deciding whether I should pursue seeing any therapist. I may follow CBT and DBT techniques online and skip seeing a therapist altogether. I doubt I will see someone else as professional and helpful as her, and I want to save my money. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ Therapists fees range from anywhere between $80 to $250 a session _AT_MENTION_ Yeah it gets pricey."

176178839,"I completely agree with _AT_MENTION_ . My dad was abused as a kid because he was the red-headed step child (only his hair was black). He could never do anything good enough or right. His parents (bio mom, adoptive dad) would pit him against each other (i.e. “If you don’t do x then I will beat you.” while the other would say, “If you do x, I will beat you.” He could never win.). When he starts talking about his parents, it’s very clear that he has never been able to move past the physical and emotional abuse. He turns 60 in August. I try to avoid talking about his mom (his dad died when I was a kid) because he gets so upset and just goes on and on about how awful they were. He’s so hung up on the past that he can’t look to the future to see the good things that have come his way. It makes me sad for him. I love him very much. Don’t let something like this control your life; you have to rise above it."

E _USER_ID_?ska, A _PERSON_, M _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatria polska , Jun 30 2019 The aim of the study was to assess the supply of selected vitamins and minerals in the daily food rations of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.62 schizophrenia patients (32 women and 30 men aged 21-64, the mean age of women was 41.3 ± 11.2, the mean age of men was 36.1 ± 9.7) took part in the study. A 24-hour diet recall from 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day was used for quantitative assessment of the diet.In the conducted research, it was shown that, despite ensuring the average supply of energy required for a given age and sex group, the food rations of patients of both sexes were characterized by a deficiency of vitamin D, folates, potassium, calcium, and also vitamins E and C, magnesium in men as well as iron and iodine in women. Excessive amounts of vita
mins B2, B6, sodium, and phosphorus were found in food rations of persons of both sexes and vitamins A, B1, niacin in food rations of women and also vitamin B12 in food rations of men.No supplementation of schizophrenia patients' diet is recommended; it is only justified in individual cases of patients in whom vitamin and mineral deficiencies were found on the basis of analysis of their food habits. However, it is necessary to provide each schizophrenia patient with appropriate food education that will allow them to choose products that contain all nutrients needed for proper functioning of the body, including the central nervous system."

The L version is the one that is in proteins and that is used by the body. The D version of serine (D-serine) has been studied in SZ. I don’t think you’re going to be able to find it for purchase as a supplement, it’s not a kind that people can get from diet and I’m not sure it’s safe at least not in the context of people just buying it over the counter and using it without medical supervision. I don’t think the two are interchangeable, but I did find this on wikipedia: D -Serine, synthesized in neurons by serine racemase from L -serine (its enantiomer ), serves as a neuromodulator by coactivating NMDA receptors , making them able to open if they then also bind glutamate .

174387962,"ok I’m back, friends. The C4A/C4B gene are encoding two proteins (complimentary C4-A and B). When these genes excessively produces these two types of protein, they can cause bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. This leads to a defect in the gene, which is called a mutation. Deficiency of these genes cause a neurological disorder called lupus or SLE, and there seem to be two entries for deficiencies. I was not able to find an inheritance type of this mutation. Also the C4A/C4B genes work closely with other types of genes as well, especially with other complimentary system genes (like C3). This is why if this one gene is not working properly, it is possible that other genes won’t do the job as well. Also there seems to be no entry in OMIM (catalog for genetic diseases) for this mutation either…so it’s a mystery or not well-known, at least. There’s a whole bunch of entries for schizophrenia but not for these genes."

Put on some calming music to help you relax. Can you get any benzos prescribed to you? Hope this helps."

And hopefully you will gradually get used to it."
176178919,"I mentioned in a previous post that I was suffering from some paranoid delusions like getting shot by a sniper in my own home. There seems to have been a correlation between B-vitamins I was taking and this episode. I was taking 500mg niacin every day plus a B-vitamin complex every other day. I stopped and got better instantly. I have started taking them again, but now only take them every third or fourth day which seems to be okay. I can’t explain this, but guess I must have got a toxic reaction from a vitamin overdose. I didn’t see this connection because I have heard of other people tolerating many grams of niacin daily and their symptoms are improved. I guess this is just another example that we all react and tolerate things differently."

176178943,"Wow, youre lucky to look above average. You should be thankful to that. I think in most cases, its all in the mind to believe thst one is ugly. The self tends to be biased towards a more negative opinion. But if you look around at the rest of the population, most people are just about average dressed, average weight, and just so so with the way they look. They are too busy leading respectable lives with their families and kids and just carelessly dressed for comfort. They dont carry a microscope to peoples flaws like spoiled princesses or superficially low life people. I knew some people who had an extremely mentally ill myopic view of other people and was always on the edge for eyeing competition. She thought she was a 10/10 even if she wasnt. The problem with 10/10 women or those who care excessively about plastic surgery is that they get worried about their “crown status” being taken away by the next 10/10 or plastic surgery contender. Its very funny seeing their nervousness. With the rest o
f us sverage folks we are just happy feeling comfortable snd looks arent top priority. People like those who make them feel comfortable with kindness rather than scrutinizing princesses who believe in their minds they are better than the 99% sround."

I am out of reality with or without meds. Without meds I can’t function because of positive and cognitive symptoms. With meds I can’t function because of negative and cognitive symptoms. There is no way out, its permanent brain damage that starts in the parietal lobes causing positive symptoms and in worse cases like mine it spreads to the frotal lobes causing negative symptoms.

174387985,"ABSTRACT Delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS) is an umbrella term encompassing a variety of disorders. One rare form of DMS is the delusional misidentification of one’s own reflection, known as “mirrored self-misidentification syndrome”. In “mirror image agnosia”, the ability to identify the image of self and/or others in the mirror is lost, while the ability to identify the mirror itself is preserved. To our knowledge, mirror image agnosia has never been described in a patient with schizophrenia. Herein we present a case of a patient with schizophrenia with severe delusions of both mirrored self-misidentification and mirror image agnosia without any structural abnormalities or dementia. KEYWORDS: Mirror agnosia, mirror image agnosia, delusional misidentification syndrome, schizophrenia, psychosis https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/_PHONE_NO_.1799019?journalCode=nncs20"

176178954,"Good to hear from you. Vaping is better for you than smoking, though of course being off nicotine all together is the best, and it definitely wont help you quit as vapes and juuls have MORE nicotine, much more than cigarettes. And nicotine itself is damaging to cardiovascular system and long term use leads to things like increased clotting risk so strokes and heart attacks, erectile dysfunction, etc so swapping to vapes isn’t going to really help that because again it is more nicotine than cigarettes. But off my soapbox. Glad you are doing well"
176178955,"I also believe my symptoms are driven by existential fears and issues. I still do have a major problem though, because they upset me so im out of control and terrified at times.

That - and those people that wrongly assume im thick and mentally deficent just cos i got Sz. If i do moan about my MH - its because im feeling vulnerable and looking for genuine support.

Just think, people who always hung out online are having their moment now! It’s our time to shine! Plus I’ve made tons of friends online my entire life and many of them converted into IRL friends. So it’s not a waste of time. Finally I’ll be the first to say that I’m a loser and I really don’t care if anyone knows it."
176178968,"Thank you everyone! I was having butterflies in my tummy this morning, since it’s been so long since I worked. I was afraid I was going to have a hard time remembering things. The office manager I worked with has only been in her job since October, and the volunteer coordinator has only been there since March. Then there’s a social worker who’s only been there since February and a chaplain that’s only been there since March. That made me feel more comfortable. None of them had any notes or job manuals about how to do their jobs, they are just figuring it out as they go and leaning on each other for support. Sometimes the only thing you can do is pull the most recent example of something out of the file and then figure out how to recreate it. I’ve done that plenty of times in past jobs. On Friday it will just be figuring out things like exactly how their copier works. They’re not going to give me major work to do, just simple back office stuff. I think I made a good decision to go to tha
t office."
176178969,I tried drinking the other night and enjoyed it immensely for about 15 minutes. Then it just magnified my symptoms and I felt out of control. I just had a shot neat. Learn my my mistakes and stay the #### away from alcohol. In the words from my good friend.

And when I woke up after 3 hours of sleep I thought I will be fine so I showered and had my coffee. I decided to lay down and then I heard a sentence coming from my PC tower police saying: we are the the door waiting. It sounded like it came from radio walkie talkie. It freaked me out, but I realized that was unreal, but made me quite paranoid. For 3 years since my illness I did not hear any voices and why it’s happening now I have no idea. I’ve been thinking about upping my Invega dosage and see where it leads me"

174387984,"Yeah I’m sorry to hear, sounds like an amp comedown but all the time. Did you have this before risperdal? I fortunately don’t suffer negative symptoms -except for maybe general lazyness- , only when I’m full on psychotic and the positives clog up my mental capacity to process other stuff. Anyway maybe ask your doctor for an upper AD or an ADD-vice or something. Or if all else fails chug a ton of coffee from the morning till the evening. Out of curiousity, when did this start? In the beginning of the disease or later on."

176178988,"I was physically, sexually and emotionally abused by different people during my childhood. It was a very tough time in my life because I thought about jumping off a building because that was the only way I saw out. I’m glad I didn’t. My step mom and my dad beat me very badly and would scream at me and then I was sexually abused by a man and a cousin. I didn’t know how to deal with it so I seemed to have blocked it out of my mind. Since my psychosis a lot of these memories were triggered that I seem to have forgot about. But with time I forgave everyone and wished them the best. My step mom was diagnosed with breast cancer which seemed to change her. She is a very different person that I remember her from my childhood. Since my diagnosis my family has shown great compassion and were there for me. It’s not easy to deal with but again time seems to change people and heals everything. The best you can do is to forgive those people that hurt you and move forward with your life. I never went to t
herapy or counseling but I just managed to move on with time and came to terms with all of this."
176178989,I will see what happens and try to find another job. I am not worried about it. I am a 100% disabled veteran. Nobody really expected me to be able to do this anyway. It’s not like I am disappointing anyone.
176178990,That sucks. Hopefully eventually he’ll see how much he’s hurting you and at least try.
176178991,"I’ve noticed in the selfie thread a lot of people look tired/drugged, like they’re not present. I was told I had that vacant dopey look when I was on heavier meds"
176178992,"I didn’t buy the study, and the Japanese authors are searchable (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _USER_ID_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_). The line “All patients were refractory to currently available antipsychotic agents, but improved without exception and with no adverse reactions” in the results of the study convinced me to try it out. It raises histamine levels so it’s not totally clear cut beneficial for everybody. _AT_MENTION_ says that of the people his psychiatrist recommends this to, half get better, and half don’t, roughly. Some even get worse (but get better after they stop taking it.) YMMV."
176178993,Maybe you could find somewhere else to spend some time? A forrest or park in your car somewhere? Sounds like you need some time alone even if its only for a few hours a day
176178994,"Sure I do. But, I wasn’t given that option by my pdoc. He told me to take the Cogentin as needed."

176178997,Is it possible to find a new doctor who might be able to adjust your meds? Cause if your becoming suicidal that’s (obviously) very bad.
176178998,i’d do it over the phone although i’m going to go see my pdoc thursday. i don’t like the videocalls and i barely see anybody but him as they bring me there by car right in front of the door.

176179001,I’m the same. No emotions at all. Complete numbness. I want to cry (I understand that this is where I would normally cry) but I cannot. They say it’s not only due to the medicine but also due to the illness. Though I’m not sure what to do in your case because you have mentioned that it all started before the meds. I read an interesting article recently on this topic there are some useful tips. Unfortunately cannot post the link here as I’m new. One of the advices there was ACT therapy ( Acceptance and Commitment therapy) to address emotional numbness that I’m planning to try out. Good luck and hope it helps.

174387992,Clozapine is the best.
176179009,Did the Dr approve the increase? I am on 4mg Cogentin so pretty sure your Dr can increase it.
176179010,"thank you _AT_MENTION_ . Yes, I have prescriptions for psych meds for 3 months. The Endep (amitriptyline from my pdoc) has in the past allowed me to sleep & be pain free and therefore work. Something’s gone awry now I have an acute injury being treated by osteo. I’m having to turn down work shifts on osteo’s advice - I’m not certain it’s about addiction, it may be about a chronic pain/injury situation. Until now my pdoc had sorted it with Endep so I could work shifts no worries. Yeah, you’re right, tomorrow is a new day. My Osteo was actually very sweet and encouraging (and sane which is always helpful to my psychotic m.o.). I may just need a few weeks off work (which is physical & requires excellent physical health). I’m just a bit bummed that my pain stopped me from attending a long awaited appointment with my pdoc & friend/social worker. My friend/social worker was going to advocate for me to get a diagnosis & perhaps more effective treatment. So I feel like I squandered that oppor
tunity 'cos I had such sever muscle spasm I couldn’t drive to the appointment. It’s rescheduled to Feb. Maybe that’s all for the best. Maybe I’ll be in a better place to negotiate with my pdoc in Feb."
176179011,It sucks… there is a lot I can’t eat without pain

176179014,I applied for disability about a year ago and got denied. I don’t know why I got denied I had paperwork from my doctors to prove my illness. I’m going to try again. I heard that a lot of people get denied the first time around. It would definitely help me out
176179015,"Sorry? I can’t imagine my mother putting me on medication at that age, it just wasn’t something people did in the year 1983, but then again, I wasn’t showing any symptoms, not til mid to late 20’s."

176179023,"I’ve seen shock therapy do a lot of good. This one guy in the mental hospital was badly depressed and barely responsive to his environment. They gave him ECT, and he pulled right out of it. He became very outgoing. He had intellectual aspirations, and one time I read a little of this “book” he was writing, and it was barely intelligible. I wonder if the ECT had anything to do with that."

174387997,"APDA Psychosis & Hallucinations | American Parkinson Disease Assoc. A Guide for Understanding Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis Hallucinations & Delusions What is Parkinson’s disease psychosis? Parkinson’s disease psychosis is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease that causes patients to experience... Parkinson’s disease psychosis is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease that causes patients to experience hallucinations and/or delusions. More than half of all patients with Parkinson’s disease eventually develop symptoms over the course of their disease. Diagnosing and treating this condition can be complex. The condition relates to both neurology (the branch of medicine that deals with the nervous system) and psychiatry (the branch of medicine that is focused on mental and behavioral health). For this reason, Parkinson’s disease psychosis is considered a neuropsychiatric condition, since it deals with mental health symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) caused by a disease of 
the nervous system (Parkinson’s disease). A bit of story from me: I took a parkinson’s med because my doctor thought it was beneficial. However, it caused intense psychosis which I was struggling with intense positive symptoms. My thoughts are with everyone with parkinson’s disease. It’s a cruel disease to have."
176179037,I had exactly the same experience. I wish I had tried something else earlier.
174388000,"I do take your advice with me btw, i speak to my psychiatrist next week. I will discuss the med thing again. I sometimes wonder what is the best strategy, more meds, less meds. When im stable for a few days i always get optimistic “Im healed! Throw the meds in the wastebin!” When im unstable im like “oh no! I will be like this forever! I will never be happy anymore!”"
176179039,"Hey, I may not really know you (too much time away from the forum lately) but I hope things get better for you. We’re all here for you."
176179040,Do any of you do keto? I’m thinking about maybe starting it.
176179041,Why do you feel that way _AT_MENTION_ ?
176179042,Maybe my ancestors are like guardian angels watching over me.
176179043,"I mean no, but I am a bit skeptical they placed you on heavy duty psych meds without reason. Some APs (seroquel) are prescribed at low dose for sleep purposes, but they do not act as an antipsychotic at that dose. What lead to you seeing a psychiatrist to begin with? Did you just see them because you couldn’t sleep? If you have sleep issues I recommend getting your primary doc to refer you to a neurologist, they are the ones that diagnose and manage sleep disorders."
176179044,"Seroquel is the only AP I know of that is prescribed PRN as an off label sleep aid. It makes sense that you might feel sluggish on it. I know a guy who takes it, and works out 5 hours a day, works full time, and engages in endless hobbies after work. So it obviously doesn’t affect everyone the same way. But if it is causing you issues, it seems wise to ask for a change. I will say I used to have intrusive thoughts of causing harm. I took gabapentin for about a year, and it helped, but it gave me side effects so I switched to CBD. I don’t struggle with those issues anymore. I never acted violently, just had thoughts that disturbed me. I never had a plan or desire to act on them so I was not deemed a high risk."
176179045,"Cooking is absolutwly a chore, especially with how often we have had to do it lately."
176179046,We got the cheese sticks as an appetizer. I ordered wings and my son ordered shrimp. He is a pescatarian now.
176179047,Nope only when psychotic
176179048,This sounds very concerning. I would definitely switch because of this. Definitely discuss with your doctor to see what your options are.
176179049,Not with his mind though. With his physical actions.
176179050,becoz of side effects like me
176179051,no im not i told the staff i have urges to kill someone
176179052,"The problem with replying to a solipsist is what’s the point? They don’t believe I’m a real being, so how can I tell them anything they don’t already know. It’s the only unusual belief I literally can’t reply to without feeling like it’s pointless to do so. The other ones at least acknowledge me as a real person who can help."
176179053,Anyone ?
176179054,Wow sorry to hear that. If my doctor passed away Id be pretty shocked Hope youre doing well and have care elsewhere too that cant be easy

When I do die I hope it is not some prolonged illness like Alzheimer’s or cancer. I’d want something fairly quick, like a massive heart attack."

176179065,Go on a round the world trip.
176179066,_AT_MENTION_ I wouldn’t worry about what a nurse said. I had a similar thing happen to me and I think it’s safe to say the nurse who told me I would be on benefits for the rest of my life was completely wrong. You can be an exceptional example and prove these people wrong for their hasty judgements.
176179067,Its hard to believe because you’re only looking at the US. China is ~1.5 billion and India is over 1.4 billion. These two countries alone represent close to half of world’s population. The US is only 0.32 billion.

176179069,Mmh and what about the other personality disorders?
176179070,Have a nice night _AT_MENTION_ . Glad I could help.
176179071,Gulkand is a sweet preserve of rose petals from the Indian subcontinent. It is prepared using special pink rose petals and is mixed with sugar. Its marketed as safe but actually major component in paan. When paan is made from gulkand its named meeta paan or tasty paan. Its taste lingers in tongue even if washed many times. For safety reason its best to avoid it fully.

176179076,I am going out with my friend tonight. I hope I will be ok and will make it. I want to see my best friend on Monday and go with her to Lenscrafters. I miss her so much. I want my thoughts to be private and not have anyone sabotage them. I don’t know why people are doing this to me.
176179077,First time I heard something was due to drug induced psychosis. I checked myself into a hospital and I could hear my friends talking on the other side of the curtain. I asked the nurse to let me talk to them and when the pulled the curtain back no one was there. When sz actually hit me it was my neighbors too talking about my smoking habit. When I started hearing them at work I knew something was up
176179078,"I always want to do this, but when it comes to getting rid of stuff I like that I know are bad for me - pizza, burgers etc. I never know what to actually replace them with. So I end up eating them still and not changing"
176179079,I was also diagnosed with mdd w psychotic features at first but they gave me antipsychotics
174388002,"I am completely dependent on my negative relation with the state and the support of my family for my survival. I say negative because I am basically viewed as someone with a problem, i.e. schizophrenia, which I have been diagnosed with. From such a base, why do I think I can launch into world politics and have an impact? Not only is it a trigger, it is a completely delusional view of my own situation. I do not know how I am ever going to stand on my own two feet. If the state benefits and family support were taken away from me I would be on the street left to die. I simply cannot look after myself, but if I am to start, I need to cut out all the delusions of being able to make a difference to the world as a whole. Thank you."
174388003,Read the article… and they are talking more about the blood brain barrier than the vessels. Good research to see. It looks like that’s their devout approach so that’s cool to see more fully explore.
176179080,"I’m asking because when I resumed meds in 2013 after my relapse, I coped well on amisulpride alone. But then two years later I needed olanzapine as well. Then I coped ok for a few years Then last year needed to go on lamotrigine as well. Coped well. Now I am needing an increase in lamotrigine. So does that mean I’m going to need more and more meds over time? Or is it just that my sza is getting worse?"

174388010,I’ve had my fair share of people like that in my life. Too smart for their own good
174388001,"I think things have gradually improved for disabled people. Not everywhere and sadly not enough. I remember when I was about 13 or 14 years old, a couple who were old friends of my parents visited. They had a son around my age. I had a few friends over and we were playing a video game I had rented back when that was a thing. It wasn’t an easy video game, matter of fact, I’d say it was a difficult one. Fun but difficult. Well, the son of the couple who was visiting watched as we played. I politely handed him the controller because he seemed eager to try it. Well, with guidance of my friends and I who were there, he was able to pass the first two stages. We had only gotten up to the 4th stage. Time passed by and it was the last day to return the video game rental without being charged a late fee. So as was normal then, I decided I’d walk with my friends to the rental store to return it. The new kid wanted to come along. My friends and I were fine with him joining. The dude was genuinely cool an
d pleasant to have around. Well, it came time to return the video game. He asked his mom if he could come along. She was very hesitant. They were from out of town and therefore not familiar with where the video store was if he anything happened. I mentioned that it was a small town and the rental store was only about a 15 minute walk. She looked at her husband for guidance, he nodded his head, our new friend had permission to go with us. Before we left, his mom implored that I hold his hand while walking across any street. Off we went. As we walked, we came a cross a few streets. I held his hand, we walked across everything was fine. Eventually we got near the video store, which was on a main road that often had people who were walking. As we got near the street to cross it. I reached out and held his hand. We walked across it but as we did, I realized people were giving us funny looks. My friends didn’t care, neither did I honestly. We returned the game and walked back. It was a good day. When we returned 
he told his mom he wanted a Playstation 2. Heheh. Years later people would sometimes mention someone they knew saw me holding hands with another guy. It was a small town after all. So what does the story have to do with the topic? Our new friend, the son of the couple that were old friends of my parents, the guy whose hands I held, he had Down Syndrome. That day stays in my mind. I never was mean to people who had a disability, but I learned two things, one is that people with Down Syndrome are not stupid as some would assume. They think differently. He was able to pass two stages with guidance of a video game some friends had struggled with. We had a blast guiding him through it too. The second thing I learned… I consider that day a good memory but I will never forget the states and looks when crossing the street while holding his hand. Some people looked almost afraid, their facial expression wide eyed as they walked past us. That experience was just one day… some people have that experience their entir
e lives. People looking at them in fear. Well, over time I developed schizophrenia and now feel those looks more often. On a good day I can feign being normal but man… I am glad I had that experience and more importantly, I am glad he was super happy that day. I was going to go on about how it might be a godsend if one of the Kardashians developed schizophrenia, but he, I wouldn’t wish it on them or anyone and they already advocate for transgender people’s rights. I mean their is _PERSON_ West with bipolar disorder and bringing awareness to mental illness can be a good thing… but he seems to have gone the religious route, I wouldn’t call that bad except that… he has this aggrandized sense of self (I wouldn’t call it a delusion, I mean he is world famous after all) and from some of what I’ve read and seen he might have a messiah complex. The thing that bothers me most though is that… well I’m no theologian… but if I’m not mistaken the central figure in the beliefs he preaches and has se
rmons about, well if I’m not mistaken, that figure had teachings about humility, modesty, compassion, and forgiveness. I’m not hating on _PERSON_ and I almost feel bad for singling him out but let’s face it, many of those in the spotlight who preach about the figure who brought those teachings… well they hardly practice humility and modesty… maybe forgiveness to a certain extent but forgiveness, in it’s truest form requires humility, modesty, and compassion. Even when forgiving oneself as a higher power might allow us to do so… forgiving others is easier than forgiving oneself for any sadness, regrets, guilts, and remorseful feelings one might have. Sorry… I sort of went off tangent. I didn’t my best to avoid religious discussion, I tried to speak of it more in a philosophical manner. Anyway, in short, _PERSON_ West might be a public figure who has identified having bipolar disorder and that isn’t too bad of a thing. That and… in a sense, after years of schizophrenia I have forgiven myse
lf about having it. It is not because I am a bad person, it is not a punishment from the great potato in the sky. It is just something that happens."

People born and raised in cities are twice as likely to develop schizophrenia. Neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex, a brain region active during rumination – repetitive thought focused on negative emotions – decreased among participants who walked in nature versus those who walked in an urban environment.

176179165,"In the early nineties I was working at HP as a recycler. I recycled mainly cardboard, crammed it into a huge compactor. Worked my ass off for three years. It was a HUGE facility and our little crew was only three of us and our supervisor. One day after I had been there a year or two a new worker started for HP, a really pretty blond woman about 26 years old. I saw her a couple times and she stopped to talk with me, we talked a little a couple times a week and it turns out she was having marital problems. It was a little bit weird that she confided in me but nothing bizarre or anything. I learned early on she was a devout Christian. Very active with her church. After about a month we were talking one day and she told me she was having a bunch of her friends over her house for a little prayer meeting the next night and she invited me over to join them. I asked if I could bring a friend from the board & care and she said sure. So me and my friend took a bus to get to her house the next night. When we 
found the address, it was a huge, beautiful two story house and it was even nicer inside. We got introduced and incidentally her sister was even more beautiful than her. All her friends were there and she led us out to a screened in back porch. About 7 of us sat in a circle and a prayers and nice words were exchanged among her friends. My friend happen to be a funny guy. We always had a lot of laughs for the seven years I knew him. He didn’t take himself to seriously and was just plain funny. And then out of the blue the group started singing. Me and my friend didn’t know what to do. There was no way either of us were going to sing and we didn’t know any of the religious songs anyways. But we were on the same wavelength and I looked at him and he looked at me, and we both were trying not to crack up. For one thing, even just being there in the first place was ludicrous. We were both paranoid schizophrenics and here we were in this posh, upscale million dollar home, while we were both living in the worst 
neighborhood in a board & care home. We were not religious at all, and were sitting with a group of beautiful, rich people. The situation was just hilarious and we were stifling our laughter. And even funnier, all the people were treating us really seriously like stuff like this happens to them everyday. Then, the icing on the cake was when they started singing a Christian rock song and they were singing, “Our god is an awesome god.” (it’s actually quite a popular song). But this was 1991 and people were still using the word awesome. But we both found it funny and almost lost it laughing. We somehow made it through the meeting and then we left to catch a bus home. We were still laughing."

174388028,"Brain & Behavior Research Foundation – 12 Mar 18 NAC Medication Improves Working Memory in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Patients... Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder who suffer symptoms of psychosis given two grams of the medication N-acetylcysteine (NAC) showed improved performance on working memory tests after 6 months of treatment, according to a study published... The researchers turned to NAC as a possible treatment for cognitive symptoms in these disorders because it impacts docking ports for the chemical messenger glutamate on neurons involved in cognition, including memory and information processing. The medicine, often used for acetaminophen overdose and to loosen mucus in pulmonary disease, has also been tested previously as a supplement in some psychiatric treatments. In addition to working on glutamate, NAC enhances growth and survival of neurons and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, Dr. _PERSON_ points out.

174388029,"So I asked my father how I could help him best, and he said “the best thing you could do is get off my back”, he went on to say that I was largely a burden to him indirectly by being a burden on my mother. My mother sorts everything practical out for me and provides me with emotional comfort. I don’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a means of independent finance and I can’t stay stable without relapsing for any great length of time. These problems have been with me for the past twenty odd years. All I do is process my reality with my thoughts. To this extent reading esoteric books and doing esoteric physical exercises are not really helpful in making me independent. They capture my attention more than anything else, but they don’t lead anywhere except to more thought processing. They don’t even necessarily help me with avoiding relapse, sometimes they do and I seem to make progress, sometimes they actually destabilize me. I don’t want to be a burden, but I have this condition, and I
’ve had it for the past twenty years. I want my parents to be happy. I worry about what will happen when they’re gone. I should be taking steps to support myself, get a girlfriend, and stop relapsing. I am focused on these things, but nothing I do seems to help. Journaling is helping, it captures my attention more than anything else, and I have been wondering today if I could somehow make money out of writing. But I am not a good writer, struggle to write fiction and my non-fictional writing is all over the place moving from topic to topic at random. I can’t really concentrate on any one thing for more than fifteen minutes or so, about the time it takes me to write a post in one of my journals. I struggle with philosophy, getting nowhere. Earning a living as a philosopher is tough, I don’t have a philosophy degree for a start, and you have to be both well read and able to write well, not to mention original. At the moment I am trying to write every day, hopefully improving my writing, but I am still l
argely processing my own disfunctional reality. I don’t know if anyone wants to read what I write. It would be nice to start a blog, but I don’t really feel ready. Journaling on forums is the best way for me at the moment. Years ago, my father warned me that I was like a butterfly with my attention, never really focusing on one thing for long enough to get good at it, and this is still the case. I still want to make sure I read at least five pages of a book each day, whether it will get me anywhere, I don’t know, but the discipline of some sort of routine is good. In fact I have a routine of eating and drinking coffee. I know many people link coffee to schizophrenia, but I’ve found it helps me, especially with the meds. I have a very high tolerance for coffee. My routine of eating and drinking coffee doesn’t get me anywhere. As I said, I want to get off my parents back. I just can’t seem to do it. There is only one reason for this, my condition. I have to get better. Thank you."

174388035,"We all have our good and bad days. I guess I was just trying to be optimistic because it’s rare that people with sz find anything that actually works for them and it seems like I finally found something that is working for me. But, just because it appears to be working for me however; doesn’t necessarily mean it will work for you. For instance, I am allergic to Risperdal. The moment I took it I felt like I was going to pass out. Later, I started to get a fever and pain in my hands and feet. I thought I was going to die! luckily, I took a Tylenol that brought the fever back down and I gradually started returning to normal without having to go to the ER. I hope you and your Doctor will come up with a treatment plan that works. It doesn’t necessarily have to involve meds."

You are lucky that at least you can drive, I cannot. I worked for a few months doing a work placement in IT, yet afterwards my health got worse so haven’t ventured that much into employment. I like online courses, they’re a brilliant way of learning new stuff, I want to dedicate more time to this study, to see if I can get a job. I also live with my parents. Could be worse I suppose!"

176179192,"So you think, that we are not fine even on meds, because of the negatives? Maybe yeap, yeah… My ex pdoc said, that i have paranoid sz with mostly negative symptoms. So we should fight now? Not give up? Pls, _USER_ID_, try to fight too… The emotional pain is also a negative?"

174388055,"Its not 100% the same: “Brexpiprazole has more blocking and less stimulating activity at the dopamine receptors than its predecessor, aripiprazole, which may decrease its risk for agitation and restlessness. Specifically, where aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity or agonist effect at the D2 receptor of 60%+, brexpiprazole has an intrinsic activity at the same receptor of about 45%. For aripiprazole, this means more dopamine receptor activation at lower doses, with blockade being reached at higher doses, whereas brexpiprazole is the opposite. By contrast, brexpiprazole has a much higher affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor than aripiprazole as well as a much higher intrinsic activity.” en.wikipedia.org Brexpiprazole Brexpiprazole, sold under the brand name Rexulti among others, is an atypical antipsychotic.

174388062,"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp._PHONE_NO_ in at least two large, independent data sets involving a total of more than 3,700 individuals, cerebellar volume has been found to be significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia and significantly correlated with psychotic symptoms (6, 7). Moreover, a study of clinical high-risk subjects demonstrated cerebellar-thalamo-cortical dysconnectivity as a state-independent neural trait for prediction of psychosis. In this issue of the Journal, _NAME_ and colleagues (9) present a two-step study to approach this question by combining resting-state functional MRI, state-of-the-art brain network analysis, and brain stimulation. Considering the fact that negative symptoms are strongly associated with cognitive impairments and are a major rate-limiting feature of long-term functional outcomes in schizophrenia, these investigators started with a completely data-driven approach to exhaustively search for connectome-wide associations. they discovered that the con
nectivity between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and midline posterior cerebellum showed the strongest correlation with negative symptoms across the whole brain during resting state. Specifically, patients with higher negative symptoms had significantly lower cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity, suggesting that disrupted synchronization in the cerebellar-prefrontal circuitry underlies negative symptoms and possibly also cognitive dysfunction. In the second part of the study, _NAME_ and colleagues investigated whether the altered connectivity between the cerebellum and DLPFC could be a causal mechanism for negative symptoms or rather an epiphenomenon. They performed a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) trial targeting the posterior cerebellum in an independent group of patients (N=11) to examine whether rTMS could boost the functional connectivity of the cerebellar-prefrontal circuitry and in turn ameliorate clinical symptoms. Intriguingly, after a 5-day (4 hours per day) rTMS administr
ation, most patients in the sample showed an increase in cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity, the degree of which was significantly correlated with improvement in negative symptom severity. Notably, more than 60% of total variance in symptom change could be attributed to the change in cerebellar-prefrontal connectivity, corroborating a possible causal relationship from disrupted connectivity in cerebellar-prefrontal circuitry to negative symptoms in schizophrenia."

176179291,_AT_MENTION_ Did you tell her you were suicidal?
176179292,I actually can’t remember how it started possibly he introduced himself via the ghost sex. He was a person but also some universal force he seemed to have influence over the whole world people and nature etc etc. It started off as a friend type person in my head I was so intrigued by him cos he was funny and the sex was out of this world. Its like I could sense his humour in my head so I was laughing at seemingly random times at work and my colleagues were actually happy they just thought I was in a better mood. Then slowly requests came in for me to better myself and at first I was really enthusiastic about it but then one day when he started making me read stuff online which was hallucination text about hell and heaven and how I am actually by birth predestined for hell but he wanted to give me a chance to get to heaven… That’s when I started to feel a heavy pressure to perform well In all requests that he was making. And I’m not good with that kind of pressure. On top of that I had a crus
h on him cos he was so funny confident in a way and that sex was amazingly good. He is actually a person in real life that I knew of too and he was requesting that I travel across the globe to live near him eventually. Or he moves near me So he started to get more frustrated in subtle ways cos I was feeling more n more self conscious aswell as scared to be not good enough to go heaven. And that made me feel more exhausted and I started to get worse and worse at doing things he said. Including strange demands like staying up all night and just conversing with him non stop And then somehow it ended up with me having to just go to hell. And he was now like a different person. Really demanding n critical and pleading me to just accept my fate in hell forever on my own. So I was just pleading and pleading at night in the park begging him praying to the sky to not take me there. He said its too late. Said I was going to explode as first episode/part of hell. So I just laid myself in the park until the early hours o
f the morning waiting to explode. I finally accepted it. The dog walkers saw me with only my underwear on cos I didn’t want my clothes to stock to me when I melt from the explosion. They called the ambulance. That’s the main part of it in a nutshell
176179293,"I would rather exist with sz, than not exist at all."
176179294,"First lesson about me is actually a new realization I am just having about my illness. I have been out of the hospital (“in need of a tune up”) for over a year now, and I used to think that hallucinations were the bane of my existence. The very thought of experiencing something that was not real shook me to my core on more than one occasion (ahem…all the time). But now that I have started managing my illness on a more “high functioning” level–and let’s not open the debate on what exactly THAT means–I’d have to say that the real monster is paranoid delusion. A little kernel of truth that is sparked into a completely warped sense of reality markets itself as a secondary symptom, but, in fact, it starts everything. That radio next door… or is it JUST a radio? That light in the hallway… did that turn on just now as I was in another room? Are they reading/changing my thoughts? That feeling of being watched, hunted, stalked, talked about, sought after…! No one should have to feel 
this way. I am truly sorry for anyone who has experienced paranoia, or paranoid delusional thinking. It’s the most difficult thing to argue against. Medication doesn’t seem to do anything but relieve the anxiety it creates. I have yet to master my paranoid mind. Maybe I never will. And that truly scares me. LESSON OVER Are there any thoughts to weigh from the class? (Ha.) I can’t be the only one who finds paranoia to be more difficult than some of the other symptoms…"

Because ever since I developed psychotic illness, I find it strugglesome mentally to visualise the effort to put in and take out things in an organised manner. The process seems heavy when I think of it. There’s no other way to put it. I want to know if it’ll improve, the way my negative symptoms have. I’m fed up being disorganised! i think the lack of orderly behaviour impacts how I perceive things and is affecting me mentally which affects me academically too. Farfetched yes, but it’s possible imo."

174388068,"http://easenet.dk/about-ease/ About EASE Anomalous subjective experiences, described since early 20th century, are thought to be intrinsic to schizophrenia and considered as constituting the phenotypic validity anchor of the schizophrenia spectrum concept. Although neglected in modern psychiatry, due to the dominating behaviouristic approach, they nevertheless have been thoroughly investigated in continental European psychiatry, where it has been shown that their presence antedates future psychosis. Anomalous experiences of self-awareness (self-disorders) are a sub-group of subjective pathology. Self-disorders are not explicitly mentioned in the current classificatory systems even though these symptoms can be classified under e.g. odd thinking or perceptual disturbance in criteria for schizotypal disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV."

176179310,A couple things I’ve noticed not sure if it’s correlated. I don’t have any cravings to abuse substances. Usually I’d feel like that because I felt hopeless and just wanted the feeling to go away so I had a craving to drink or smoke or get high on something. My sex drive seems a bit up so I do watch porn lol but I think that’s pretty normal. I’d see it as more of a habit than a substance. I had a coffee or energy drink occasionally on days where I felt the treatment wasn’t doing much to get myself moving. The energy I felt from caffeine is a much more nervous frantic energy opposed to the calm focused wakefulness I feel when the treatment has been working. Cheers Level

Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

I kinda went insane in 2011 and cannot remember much in 2012 and 2013… My entire life feels fake and manipulated and fabricated like my entire family are clones.

It doesn’t sound like your faith is compromised and that is cool. As to that circular thinking that you recognize as being different…probably a good thing to bring up with you psydoc. It’s not easy getting the meds right. It took me a lot of years and tries personally to get to a good place and sometimes that is worth the effort.

174388106,"math was my worst subject but I started at 18 years old and worked my way up from intermediate algebra (high school level) to upper division math in 3 years. Initially, I wanted to be a business admin or finance major but realized I didn’t need ‘leadership’ or ‘marketing’ and those classes after taking math were by all means a joke or too easy and just ‘fluff’ classes. I mean if I wanted to be a leader or learn leadership I would have joined the military. I have since softened my stance because marketing is very useful. I did take a few business/finance courses but not enough (or perhaps too many) and I did take some econ courses too (some ‘advanced’ ones). I realized I wanted to do economics and get a PhD and be a banker or be a banker at the World Bank or even a college professor/researcher. I realized it’s all really applied math or physics when you get up in the hard courses. I don’t know much about Libertarian Austrian Free Market economics, but there’s no math in those 
classes, compared to Kensyian or Liberal economics where it’s all super advanced math. It’s getting quantum now, no joke. So I switched to math. But I set myself up for failure and it was just a coincidence/bad experience/bad timinng that I wasn’t prepared enough for hard math classes and that I was literally ‘killing myself’ studying with prodromal and ADHD/OCD symptoms. I had anxiety and depression and stuff I developed. I realized that I wasn’t going to get into a decent or top PhD program (any really) and didn’t do internships for ibanking (recovering from global recession period) but had some minor ECs but had poor grades and neglected my math classes especially in probability § and my health. I don’t know what got into me. Why ibanking? Probably community college experience and ‘friends’ trying to get me to go to Cal and do ibanking and make money. I realized I was naive and looked only at the ranking and prestige of the place and had no knowledge of politics or history or the schoo
l or it’s liberalism… there were a few conservative clubs there but I didn’t really belong at the school. I should have stayed with economics or even done business instead or actually done electrical engineering (duh!). But I wanted to get into that school and I loved economics at the time and wanted to do research and I actually turned some potential research down due to my health and grades. I was a small fish in a big pond full of sharks! Looking back 10 years from now, I realize what on earth was I thinking and who or what nudged me to major in math or do investment banking when my current delusion thinks I created Bitcoin (I guess reality says I didn’t). Oh well, psychosis is so weird. I even think I created a time machine, which seems infinitely harder than bitcoin or creating a cure for schizophrenia in a fair, decent world."

After I broke my neck, about a year in, both insurance companies… My car insurance company, as well as my work insurance… Went to town on me. I was cut off everything and basically was going to lose everything and wind up on the street soon. That would be hard enough, but with the trauma of the accident and resulting brain and spinal cord injuries, I was on absolute overload. When I was released from the psychiatric hospital after a 3 week stay, I asked my dad, and two of my sisters to please lend me enough money so that I could afford to fight the insurance company for 6 months on their own terms. I was told that was how long it would take to be reinstated for benefits. Otherwise, I was at their Mercy. They were basically guaranteed to have their money repaid, once the suit settled None of them helped me. I think maybe that’s when my spirit finally broke. Everything 
got to be too much. My entire world was crumbling, and it just felt like nobody gave a ????. I struggle at times to forgive them, I like to think they simply didn’t realize how bad things were with the brain injury.

If you are buying that watch just to look good out in public it seems like a new pair of pants and a couple of new shirts and a new pair of shoes would make you look better and be more reasonable.

174388123,"Knowing nothing about this illness meant I was completely unaware what was happening, so I had that few years where I learned to push forward with life in terms of work etc not really knowing the reasons why things were so hard. No one actually sat me down and explained anything to me, because I never gave them a chance. The second I saw an opportunity to get rid of community services I did just that, and it was just a few weeks after being released from hospital post-diagnosis. Did ok for two years, but I blamed what I now know as negative symptoms, plus weight gain, on Olanzapine. So I quit meds and relapsed. Ever since I have been under some sort of supervision by the mental health team. I get the impression that the mental health services where I live are only interested in treating people when they become disruptive.

176179513,"The manufacturer recommends 21 days, three weeks. It is currently unknown what the efficacy is if you exceed this period. In my part of Canada, the province of _NAME_, the maximum wait between shots is 16 weeks. That’s because there’s a shortage of vaccine and they’re trying to get as many people a first shot as possible. While that’s the most ethical choice, anyone with a brain is staying in hiding after their second shot until they know what kind of protection they actually have. This will impair opening up the economy as quickly as everyone is hoping for. Pfizer recommends you still get a second shot at around the 21 day mark. Your provincial government is also coping with vaccine shortages and your premier, frankly, isn’t that smart. That’s why they’re not giving those who were infected a second dose. That’s stupid because if you had original covid then your antibodies are useless against the new variants. Pfizer and Moderna provide much better protection here."

There were no visible side effects, but one time when he was acting very serious about a “book he was writing” I read what he wrote, and it was really bad. I’m wondering if the ect did that. This guy had made a very serious attempt at suicide, and at the hospital where I was they kept him strapped down to a bed for about four months after that, before they gave him the ect. Maybe being strapped down and in isolation damaged his writing ability. Or, maybe he never had any talent, and he needed to give up on his goal of becoming a writer."

174388126,"Apparently NAC can takes 2 months to have an effect. In this trial they were using 1200mg/day ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Therapeutic effect of adjunctive N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on symptoms of chronic schizophrenia: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry , 2018 03 02 Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling psychiatric syndromes with the prevalence of 1% in the general population. Despite availability of various antipsychotics, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are difficult to treat. In addition antipsychotic monotherapy is not effective in most of these patients. Current evidence indicates the roles of glutamatergic system in this disorder. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) also increases extracellular glutamate. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical effects of oral NAC as an add-on to maintenance medication for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia.This 12-week, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was performed to determine the effectiveness of 1200mg N-acetyl cysteine as an adjunctive treatment with conventional antipsychotic medications in 84 patients with chronic schizophrenia. The subjects were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and a standard neuropsychological screening test. Data were analyzed with SPSS-16 software.NAC-treated patients showed significantly improvement in the positive (F=5.47, P=0.02) and negative (F=0.20, df=1) PANSS subscale. Also the general and total PANSS score of NAC group declined over times whilst it was increased for placebo group. Regarding cognitive functions, improvement was observed in some explored areas, such as attention, short-term and working memory, executive functioning and speed of processing. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the frequency of adverse effects.The present study detected improvement in positive, negative, 
general and total psychopathology symptoms as well as cognitive performance with NAC treatment. It is also well-tolerated, safe and easy-to-use agent as an effective therapeutic strategy to improve outcome in schizophrenia treatment."

176179598,"Im just going to share this fun video from France with girls dancing to one of my old favourite dance tracks, Blue by Eiffel 65. Paris and France is actually a very multiethnic soceity, which is probably the reason I included it in the blog. I used to dance but for some reason I didnt get around to do it much later. I guess going out to clubs wasnt really my thing. I better liked going to bars with friends. I do love music however, and also play sports. I like writing this blog, because I have read and written al my life. I see it a way of inviting people to visit places they normally wouldnt. I hear so much from people I dont know about how they are upper class and can fly around the world all the time. I even hear that girls now become expats in countries where men are the majority. I dont have a problem with this, I just wonder if its a responsible way of interacting with the world community. I have known some people from Japan because I was an expat in the Philippines and later travelled for a 
2-3 years in Thailand, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, Dubai and United Kingdom. The girl I knew from Japan was called _PERSON_ as far as I remember and its sad that I lost contact with her, but its like that. It got to be that way because I was harassed by some people who claimed I owed them money, after returning from the Philippines. Later claimed they wanted to help me by offering my free psychology sessions. Because of all this I lost _PERSON_ phone number. I also met a dutch girl called _NAME_ who I also met in the Philippines."

176179607,So 2-3 times a day I turn on running water for my cat _NAME_ and he drinks it and I also leave a bowl full of water. He waits by the sink and rubs against it like it’s my leg and waits for me to turn on the running water. Once before he turned it on by accident This morning I was like “I’ve already turned on the water for you twice this morning I’m not doing it again but if you can turn it on yourself you can have it”. At that moment he starts purring and rubbing against it and manages to turn it on. But he turned it on too fast but he did. It was the second time he’s ever turned it on. He ran away it was scary fast for him. I don’t believe I’m psychic and can communicate with animals but moreso god is sending me a message. Maybe “I am here”. Or something. Revealing/showing him/herself to me. Well I believe it’s not god but the makers of the computer simulated world we live in even though it seems real to us. Like the matrix kinda. That’s the gist of my delusions these days. 
I don’t dwell on it. I’m in love and awe with my spiritual nature and creativity. It is what it is. Sometimes I think these delusions make more sense than other more universal ideas. Idk. It’s up for debate I guess but not trying to start debates.

You learn boundaries of your symptoms and that is how you move forward. Many of us have been there before so we’re not talking shite to you. We are offering that fact that you can move forward in your life and do better… You really can do better and most of that is taking the pills.

176179683,_AT_MENTION_ . Important to remember we are a pro medication forum. Medications work over placebo and have gone through exhausting process to be adopted.

176179684,"Hey. I sent you a PM about this. I have struggled a lot with these same feelings, and it’s hard. Right now, you’re taking your anger at the system and turning it inwards on yourself, because you can’t punish the people truly responsible and you feel SOMEONE should be punished, but the only person you can hold accountable for this whole system is yourself. But that road leads nowhere good. If you kill yourself, you’ve just wasted all future opportunities you have to do good. You’re taking a person who cares and removing them from the fight for good. It would make the whole world worse, and make the fight even harder for those of us left behind. You are currently paralyzed with anger and frustration, but you won’t always be. You’ll start to figure out small ways you can make a real impact in the world. Once you’re taking actions to make things better, it will get a bit easier to take the steps you need to survive in this corrupt system. In short, killing yourself wont save any of thos

176179714,"No feelings than overpowering, overwhelming feelings. Before I was properly medicated, I used to have overpowering, overwhelming feelings. Mostly of suicidal sadness. And also of anger. Now, that I’m on proper meds, I have no feelings. At all. For example, I can think of the gruesome details of my son’s death from suicide and feel next to nothing. This is the effect of all my medications. Of which I am on many. If my meds didn’t numb my feelings, I’m fairly sure that I would be suicidal. So, I’m very glad they do render me emotionless."
176179715,Hmm if your able to work I kind of think your not disabled but forgive me if I’m wrong. The whole point of going on disability is your not able to work any job. _PERSON_ is faced paced work I’m sure you could apply somewhere else and be fine.

A therapist can light awareness to the distal environmental factors that are causing distress to your mental health.

176179742,"With unrequited love, you either acknowledge that you don’t know the person’s feelings, or that they don’t like you back. It is also always with someone you know personally. Erotomania is an intense infatuation, combined with being absolutely sure that that person is your true soulmate and will love you back/wishes you would make your move. It can be someone you know or someone you have never met, like a celebrity. It can lead you to believe illegal/creepy behaviors are actually romantic and reciprocated. Someone with unrequited love might write a love letter once. Someone with erotomania might write ten love letters every week, be convinced the other person is writing love letters back and they just aren’t receiving them for some reason, feel like the other person is telepathically communicating love to them, and might see a restraining order as a secret acknowledgement of returned affections. Basically, everyone gets crushes. Everyone experiences loving someone who just isn’t into them. 
But when you can’t accept no for an answer, or have manufactured all these elaborate romantic interactions that never happened based on things the other person does or doesn’t do that have nothing to do with you, that is when you need help."

176179744,Thanks a lot for your insight. Honestly even from the time I was diagnosed I thought I could never afford them and so I never let myself seriously consider them as a long term thing. It’s always been get them when it’s bad and then stop. Since then I’ve been seeking alternate ways but ive determined now to stay on them for at least a year and hopefully see some improvement in my life. Waking up every morning with hallucinations for months straight is unbearable even if I have to work hard to buy them. Luckily I found abilify online for $200

Some of things they had said were that they were gonna give my powerful psychedelics put headphones on me and play some of the most horrific music… It really gets terribly bad after that and I really don’t want to say more because it’s so damn horrible. During my last week at the hospital every day I kept hearing that I’m doomed and that the CIA were gonna abduct me on my ride home off the highway. I made it home and no abduction! I feel so much better now I’m home and found that I’m safe and sound. I still hear voices of the CIA trying once again telling me that I’m gonna get abducted from my home.

The recent localization of romantic love within subcortico-cortical reward, motivation and emotion systems in the human brain has suggested that love is a goal-directed drive with predictable facilitation effects on cognitive behavior, rather than a pure emotion. Here we show that the subliminal exposure of a beloved's name (romantic prime) during a lexical decision task dramatically improves performance in women in love (Experiment 1), as the subliminal presentation of a passion's descriptive noun does (Experiment 2). The parallel between love and passion allows us to interpret these facilitation effects as corresponding to cognitive top-down processes within a motivation-enhanced neural network.

If your boyfriend thinks all your beliefs are normal and nothing is wrong with you than he is wrong. And hopefully he won’t get in the way of seeking help. The sooner that someone with schizophrenia gets diagnosed and treated, the better their prognosis. You have some pretty major delusions and if they are getting in the way of your functioning and causing you distress in your life than they need to be addressed by a professional. The chances are pretty high that they aren’t going to just disappear and go away on their own. Life is hard enough but when a person also has mental problems, it can be overwhelming especially if you are not being treated for them. People do recover. People can be severely ill but with the right treatment and help they can get better."

During 1998 - 2002 while I was doing Computer Science Bachelor of Engineering I used to drink Pepsi+Coke+few other soft drinks 300 ml bottles upto 7 bottles everyday. And I did that for several years even after year 2002. My brain became more and more dysfunctional and I became a person who would imagine meaninglessly and it was called as delsuions. It can be called delusions but I don’t think these type of delusions match with paranoid type Schizophrenia 
delusions. Now, I know that after taking probiotic supplement with company name "" velgut "" cured my lifetime anger and sugars cause dementia and delusions. I’ve a severe dysfunctional brain and the medical condition or medical illness that I have is called Dementia. That is right. You heard me right ( read ). I don’t have paranoid type schizophrenia.

Eventually, I was approved for social security disability. After living in low income apartment and changing my meds to Abilify I decided to try work again at TJ Maxx. That’s a retail store. I worked part time and there for 5 years and then decided I wanted to help people with their process if recovery. So I became a peer support specialist and went back to work full time helping people with their recovery. It’s such a wonderful thing to watch individuals make progress by defining their goals and pursuing them. Whether it’s going back to college, volunteering or going back to work we can find purpose n life. I say this as someone who was in disability for over 20 years and feel like

It tries to prompt you into developing better long-term eating habits. I have to admit I haven’t pounded this much veg and fruit in a long while, so I think it’s helping there.

They think it’s the only way to pay for my sins (well, as of now). They’ve been just attacking me nonstop and I’ve been suffering physically and mentally. MD and sz is a horrible combination when you are both physically and mentally ill. It’s just so overwhelming. Also I need to stop thinking about the progression and my mom’s guilt (she’s been blaming herself so much about my MD and it’s starting to worry me). I mean, you can’t do anything about genetics and she didn’t choose her daughter to be like this. So I don’t know what to do to make her blame herself less. Otherwise I’m alright everyone. I was cl

174388268,"Oh, a genetics question! Here’s what I know so far. Usually the variants of a person with a genetic disorder get divided into three categories: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS (also known as “variants of uncertain significance”), and benign/likely benign. And genetic mode of inheritance is: x-linked, recessive, dominant Okay. So we do not know what kind of mode of inheritance is involved with the inheritance of schizophrenia. We do not know if it is a recessive inheritance or a dominant inheritance. A recessive inheritance means that both parents carry the gene, and dominant means one parent has the gene that will cause schizophrenia. So far, we have no idea what mode of inheritance causes schizophrenia. For people who have no members with sz, it may mean that the mode is recessive. For people who have brothers/sisters with sz, it may mean that the mode is dominant. It’s like central core disease caused by the RYR1 gene- the disease can be caused both recessive and dominant mode of inher
itance. So, either way the inheritance can work both ways. The short answer is: we don’t know the exact patterns of inheritance, nor we know which variants are pathogenic. That would be up to the hands of researchers."

They may be telling the truth. I will have to say though that part of my fear was the jobs were manual labor jobs which I can’t do any more due to my physical health. It would definitely be an opportunity for young people who are strong physically. Basically they gave a lot of propaganda and few details on how they would handle things such as health insurance and SSI and SSDI, a checkered past, and another red flag was that they said there would be little training involved. The person who presented it even said she didn’t want to show it to us but would otherwise be fired. There was plenty to be suspicious of. I must admit though that at this point in my life a job would provide little more than what I have on SSI because my needs are taken care of, I’m extremely afraid of losing Medicaid (I guess if they threatened to take that aw
ay if I didn’t take their job I’d have to do it) and my wants (spouse, kids, house, car, real money, real vacations) are out of reach and my viewpoint is prejudiced."

It doesn’t look like much but talk about a thorn in your side. I didn’t know the initial problem, momma just told me to rip out the ferns and expose the pipe. So I did, and I did all by hand because it was too narrow to fit a shovel in there, I had to use a gardening shovel. Then when I got that done I tested the line, turns out the line had no leaks, she was just tired of the old plants. Smh. But there was indeed a leak coming off the half inch pipe from the main line at the top of the stairs. And to make matters were there turned out to be 4 different lines running between the wall and the steps. You cant see it in the picture because the 6 inch waste/drainage pipe is obscuring the view, but underneath coming off the T joint is a L joint with a black PVC hose traversing down under the stairs. Its an old an jaded hose that they don’t make anymore. 
They’ve since been replaced with reinforced pvc in different dimensions. I went down to _PERSON_ to find some parts, but they didn’t have the parts I needed, I tried three different combinations and even made friends with a plumber who was a customer, we still couldn’t get the combination right. But before I went to Home depot I stopped by my friends place to drop off food to his dad who is a retired maintanence worker and schizoaffective. I was explaining how the leak was so old and the water pressure so high, that Iit washed all the dirt and rocks up from under the stairs and the stairs were beginning to show cracks because of the gap it made in the foundation. He had a solution for me and said because theres no double male to bridge that size just use warm water to loosen the old pipe and insert the new hard plastic into it, and now Im Everhopeful because it worked followed by some PVC glue and use of a couple adjustable clamps. Only ????? was, I had to do the repair, in the mud, blindly, and through 
feel with no room to use any tools because of the 6 inch waste pipe and the other two old lines and the space was uninviting. But now the street sprinklers don’t need to be watered by hand anymore, so Im pretty happy about that. Next step is for the dirt to go back to its home in the space between. Once that happens I can fill the lines with rock and a layer of polished stone. It should look nice when its all done. My mom even seemed happy I saved her $743. She was actually nice to me today and even made me dinner"

I had a dream recently about it. I think _PERSON_ was right about most things – perhaps everything. I think people under-estimate him including other scientists who work on GR. So because I’m contrarian and opposite of most people (Call me mr. opposite lol), I think inflation is a scam and really it’s just either rotating; aliens (advanced level 5+ civ) can make it rotate or use tipler cylinders; or conformal spaces (which I have no clue about). I’m obsessed with simulation theory and CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology). I wonder how it all fits and works together. Sort of like a UFT (unified field theory). If inflation is true, we can’t really be liv
ing in an infinite universe because what is creating the infinite space in a simulation. It’s also more ‘Christian’ ie the _PERSON_ rotating universe in my opinion.

174388335,"Hi _NAME_ and welcome to the forum. I would highly recommend mentioning some of what have you are experiencing to a doctor. They will be able to advice you. It can seem difficult to do, but they are there to help you. It is possible that you are experiencing psychotic symptoms, and if so they will be able to help you manage those symptoms so that you can live more easily. While I am no doctor, hearing voices and thinking other people are reading your mind aren’t normal experiences and may very well be precursors to a psychotic episode later down the line. And the end of your message you sign off with “I try to forget it… I’m healthy and why I would encourage negative thinking?”. This is really disconcerting for me. No one wishes ill of themselves. No one wishes for cancer or brain tumour or heart attacks etc. But if there is something wrong with you it is almost always better to take action and to be proactive about it. You aren’t weaker for seeking help, you are stronger. It is easy to 
sit and pretend things are fine - it takes confidence to make action happen. And things can only get easier with medical assistance."

176180183,"Hey, _PERSON_. Don’t get down on yourself. Weight is something a lot of people struggle with, especially those of us on antipsychotics. I agree with what ifeelblessed said, portion control is key. If you want to have a chocolate bar, that’s fine, just have a little bit. Those mini snack size candy bars might help and just have a limit on them. Exercise is important. Why’d you stop going to the gym? I need to start exercising again, too. I’ve gained weight and changing my diet alone isn’t helping. I think exercise is also key, but I understand it can be difficult to get in. I’m in the same boat. I wish you the best, _PERSON_."

174388336,I was on about 10 mg Abilify at the time … it wasn’t a high dose… i had to stop it immediately even though it was ok for my mood but I kept bleeding heaveily… I was not on it that long
176180187,Best of luck in giving up
176180188,Does Ginkgo Biloba interact with anti psychotic medication currently I’m taking olanzapine.
176180189,"Thanks, I would like to believe that."
176180190,"Lol, me too. I drink a lot of coffee and tea throughout the day and pee a lot. I want to cut down because I still have to pee a lot into the evening and night. I wake up several times a night to pee which isn’t good because I have trouble sleeping. Problem is I enjoy it."

174388340,"Yes. And I still lose my insight when I stop taking them so I’m going to stay on them for the rest of my life. Age 52, onset around 23, DXed around 24."
174388337,I guess it’s supposed to equate to 5 mg daily. Will I get any emotional numbing or cognitive impairments from a dose this low…?
176180193,"_AT_MENTION_ fck this defeatist attitude, we are the bearers of creativity. Why do you think 1% of the population has this? It’s beneficial to the overal gene pool. We just got a mad ticket hehe"
176180194,I’ve had over 90 treatments and I would never do it again. I passed out once at church then my memory was terribly effected. I don’t recommend it.
176180195,Sorry for your loss . You are amazing to be getting through this.
176180196,"I’m on risperidone 6mg, _AT_MENTION_"
176180197,Sorry you have to feel that way. This is something that you need to express to your doctor. Don’t be afraid to speak your mind. That’s the only way you are going to get what you need.
176180198,He only throws foodscraps. I don’t know what part of asia he is. He is obviously angry about something. I plan to knock on his door and introduce myself. Maybe he don’t know who we are. Maybe he thinks we are angry Australians. I believe its a communication problem. That goes on for last 2 to 3 years. In our block we tend to keep to ourselves to keep the peace. I would have liked to solve the conflict earlier but i am medicated and in theorie he can beat me up like jesus turn the other cheek and such. I have no curry in me. Usually i don’t like combatconflict and take it.
176180199,"The food is good where I’m from but it’s the smell that gets to me. Too many cleaning chemicals, bad _NAME_ nightmares, fear, lack of freedoms like no internet, computer, cell phone, limited visitions, and no outside food. That’s a big no no for me. It sucks. HIPPA laws did this but I think people did this too. They said people abused the system and rules and they had to do it. People would bring pills in their foods and take pictures of people and ????. Not anymore. I don’t like the fact they bring scary ass people in there. I know I sound crazy here, online, but I’m one of the nicest, normal people you could meet. I don’t like the fact that they’re bringing psychopaths into the mental hospital. For example, one guy was clearly a neo nazi who was aggressive to the other patients and was yelling and out of control. I heard other horror stories. My uncle used to work there for a little bit. In California, crime is rising because the prisons are over crowded and the governor is letting 
all the criminals out of prison. I’m not liberal when it comes to crime. I think eye for an eye is wrong and bad and makes the whole world blind, and some offenses like life time behind bars for pot possession are stupid. Common sense laws work and are good. But the crime and stuff is just out of control. If I ever get better and get money I’m moving the hell out of this state. I’m already a freaking minority."
176180200,Yes but she doesn’t take it seriously…
176180201,Can you explain what you have experienced that is closely related to what I’m experiencing?
174388339,"I believe they have discontinued research on that one after a phase 3 failure. Although you never know, sometimes the phase 3 failures get purchased by other companies that try to develop biomarkers for who they can help - once something makes it to phase 3 it does seem likely that it helps at least some people. I haven’t seen anything on F17464 in years, I stopped following it. What I did read about it looked good though."
176180202,Congratulations on your sobriety. I have always been fascinated with northern California so I love reading your stories. You are scaring me straight though and that is always a good thing so thank you _AT_MENTION_!
176180203,I got some chocolate almonds for bedtime. They are part of my nurses idea to get me to bed earlier on nights that I’m scared. But I been wanting to eat them early. Especially now after reading your post lol
174388344,If you explain this to a psychiatrist you’d expect them to say it’s schizophrenia or related. I think that tells you something.
176180204,"I made a list of people to contact this morning, and every so often, it hits me to contact someone that I should but haven’t yet. Mom’s extra mural nurse has even offered to take Silver and give him to her parents. I’ll have to ask my brother about it, of course. Speaking of which, I just got done coming back from the hospital on the bus to pick up an envelope containing a document signed by Mom’s doctor to help with my brother’s travelling expenses, I think. Phew! Will keep you posted, of course."
176180205,I think you may want to order a half cooked sirloin steak. Hmmmmmmm
176180206,"Same here! have felt this very often, mainly because of my upbringing and spiritual paths that I chose as a teen, it stuck by me till this day. I feel guilty over trivial problems like, asking my mom to listen to me, or even having the point in an argument. It really sucks."
176180207,Anyway keep taking that NAC with cofactors. It reduced my weight so surely yours too. Is weighing scale in home?
176180208,My aunt keeps getting afraid I will come off them… she’s a social worker… but she forgets that it was the pdoc who took me off them the first time and I never went off them without consulting someone… also I was on the meds for 10 years and had no problems with psychosis … she rekons I can come off them again but for now I have to take them… I hate it and I wish I never took sertraline… as thats what caused it…
174388343,Medscape Cariprazine Trumps Risperidone for Negative Schizophrenia Symptoms Cariprazine is more effective than risperidone for persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia and appears to be effective in patients resistant to previous treatment with other antipsychotic agents.

176180210,So don’t drink
174388348,What is ps4? Is it a video game console like Nintendo or XBox?
176180211,"Ok, so now I fight, really I even try to ignore my fears, but I was from the szs who are scared of even dying, tough paranoia from the others to the point that its even hard to sit calmly on the coach… I think we were many like this I saw other szs pacing by this fear (maybe its the paranoia) etc etc… I take my meds yeap. But lately, I am still scared but its more on the surface of my mind and body… Before, it was so deep in my soul and body, that I was in pain physically even, I was almost catatonic from this burden… For the moment, my paranoia and anxiety still make me unfunctional, but now I feel it less ‘‘deeper’’… I even started to have tremors but I find it a bit less painful… Is it a good sign in the end? My doc was saying, that personnaly, i’ll need to recover in years cause I am sick since kid… Plus my isolation lasted 15 years as you know… Gosh, i’ll continue doing things when I can, and ill try not to want too much or blaming myself when I am here terrorized b
y fear… Its what should I do, isn’t it? Yeah, I know I should push my limits now, but sometimes its too tough … But how was it for you with the paranoia? Is it a good sign that I feel it less deeper now, but still quite strongly? … I guess the paranoia is one of the toughest thing to recover… I am on this heavy Zyprexa and I still battle after 3 years on it,lol…"
176180212,I don’t believe that there’s one true love. I think there’s multiple people out there you’d find true love with and the only thing worth considering is fortune and opportunity. Love is complicated and different people you’ll still love even though they may be completely different. Never give up hope but I’d like to remind you that being open to a relationship will lead you to better ones. That is where love with thrive!

176180217,Should I be worried?
176180218,Was it from your tattoo?
176180219,"why? it’s not that hard to take your meds, right?"
176180220,That’s interesting because I have been so functional for so many years with no psychosis that I wonder what is going on underneath. I have been medicated so long I don’t remember what it is like without.
176180221,Assisted suicide is a really bad thing…
176180222,I agree. They stole 11 of mine and everything but you have to keep moving forward even one step a day. Try to keep your mind busy. What makes you happy? What keeps you busy? Try to fix your self with science. Read or study about voices. Get a scientific view of your problem and keep updating your knowlege.
176180223,"No thats probably true, but have you considered writing the down one BY one?"
176180224,Ah well. Best of luck to you.

176180231,Goan fish curry.
176180232,No one is the same as such we all have our own problems and get better to different levels. Many people with sz are famous and it’s in my opinion because their brains work differently from the normies our brains are so different and so amazing and a lot of us have special talents.
176180233,Today is a weekday and I have to go to a hospital to get medication should I go to the hospital today or go tomorrow to a pdoc appointment?

176180235,"It looks, tastes, and smells just like regular weed, but it doesn’t have any THC in it (or such a small amount that it won’t get you high). It has the relaxing effects that weed has also, but again, it’s not psychoactive. It’s legal in all 50 states here in the US. I’m taking full advantage of that, lol."
176180236,"By playthrough I mean the playing of the video game. As popular YouTubers broadcast their playing of a game, such is the case with me. Cos it’s both matrix and _NAME_ show, and also a third thing: SIMs"

176180238,Switch to a male pdr if you’re more comfortable with a male pdr.
176180239,"They were amazing! I have seen them twice now. The songs from their new album sounded just as fresh as the old stuff, but they mixed it in and played a wide range of their albums which was cool The first time they were supported by Korn. Those two bands literally came out when I first properly got into music as a kid."
176180240,I would never mix the two. It could kill you.
176180241,"maybe i would have gone to college when i was more mature. i would have been earning and working and wouldn’t have smoked so much pot. mom was always trying to talk me into becoming an electrician. now i have little skills. and have to work whatever job i can get. it’s still a possibility. school isn’t so bad for me. i can learn, my memory is improved, but i hate to write papers. right now im thinking of a 2 year degree in horticulture, it wont pay much and i may have to get a 2nd job for the offseason."
176180242,"I think they call is speed balling when you mix depressants and stimulants. That could explain your paranoia, bad sleep, racing thoughts etc. Be careful. Cheers."
176180243,"Yes. There is no cookie cutter reaction to loss, but guilt is very common. People feel like things would’ve been different if they’d called or visited more, that it should be them instead of their loved one, like they’re bad people if they’re relieved that someone’s gone, all kinds of sh it. It’s very natural, but know that this sort of guilt does not necessarily indicate any wrongdoing. It just happens."
176180244,I don’t know if you have OCD. I was taking about my situation. Discuss it with your doctor
176180245,Congratulations! Hope you can handle the stress from your new job. Best of luck!
176180246,"When I had the babies, yes. A lot. I was having breakdowns every other day from the sleep deprivation. My partner and I ended up fighting a lot during that time. We were both so exhausted. Everyone says the teenage years are hard, but I’ve found them to be so much easier than the baby years."
176180247,"It’s so simple. I got home from work yesterday and the neighbors were leaving me alone. Being the eternal optimist, my take was that they acknowledge I have a little power and I deserve a little respect and finally just let me live and let me alone. And of course my irritation and some hostility melted away. It lasted all of two hours until I realized my take on it was dead wrong and nothing had changed. But it was that simple. That’s all they have to do is acknowledge I have a little power and deserve respect and we could have gone from there and they could have left me alone and I would leave them alone and everything would be forgiven. But being diks and taking advantage they have to exercise total power, they ain’t going to acknowledge sht. I don’t even know what they do for a living but their cars aren’t much better than mine and their living in some shi*ty apartment. How powerful could they be?"
176180248,Might be out of mind for a while. I need to crochet.
176180249,You need to be in psychiatric care and on medications. Not all meds raise prolactin. You didn’t answer my question but assuming your not on meds makes your quest a bit of a problem. You don’t recover from sz without the meds.
176180250,I also have conversations with my voices
176180251,A pdoc I interact with on Twitter has said that mine is a non global impairment . I definitely don’t function as well as an average age and intelligence matched person from the general public. I asked on Quora as to what these could indicate. Cognifit bad Oct 2019715×142 4.13 KB and got told - Actually the numbers indicate someone who is a candidate for a sheltered home environment. Such an individual would be unable to compete with peers and if in adolescence would need protection from bullies.
176180252,"_PERSON_ had mixed opinions about coming out Sz. They were more or less accepting in the bar i used to drink at, but after falling out with them - it was the first thing that was chucked in my face by some members. Its the 20-30 somethings that are most likely to take the piss round here - they think your thick - so they will try and tax me for money. The older generation seemed to be more understanding. Now i keep my gob shut - cos it only feeds my paranoia these days that its gonna be used againest me."
176180253,"I challenge myself… Its just that I cant do it all the time… You know, I felt fine for a half an hour today, I never had this before… But its a pity my evenings are still bad. I start to feel dumb then, with the emotions affected by all this and worried about the future… I hardly move my body in the evenings, maybe its the meds too in fact. But whatever… I was looking for people here, who got better in years. My illness is not the typical sz, its chronical, not sharp episodes… I cant just try to live a normal life. I still don’t control my symptoms, but I do some things… Cleaning, going to the stores, reading, movies, internet and a bit of socializing with two friends left and my mom…"
176180254,"_AT_MENTION_ I just think it’s my ocd maybe Idk im no expert, I was ok during during the day but it crept up slowly. … surely. maybe later, idk im sorry im stupid anyways I think I will go talk to my dr, but sadly my Clinic is closed. … Sorry im sorry. I think I will go to the hospital thanks! _AT_MENTION_ I think I think so its a panic attack I hope but either either either way its okay, I will go to the hospital if it doesn’t get get get better sorry this is dumb… I feel like a wimp anyways ill be okay guys see I’m better guys, I feel it already I feel sane."
176180255,"I don’t know if I’m making an ethnic slur, I don’t even know what to call the descendants of angles, celts and normans in Britain, it’s never been explained to me, as I understand it, new arrivals are British and older inhabitants are English, Welsh and Scottish, excluding Northern Ireland. I think that’s what the aristocracy says. Anyway, on to my gripe, are English women too frightened to become nurses or are they just snobs, is the money that bad, or are they only interested in themselves, since when has being a Doctor been more appealing than being a Nurse, men and women are equal but different, I’m not saying either profession should be reserved for one or the other, but really, I despair at the lack of consideration English women pay to the frail."
176180256,"Woke up well rested. Played a game for a little bit. Had a normal bowel movement. Trimmed my hair, took a cold shower, cleaned up and was smelling and looking good. Went to work. Ate some good food. Made an extra $95 on top of what I get paid at work."
176180257,I want to learn Minuet in G major by _PERSON_.

176180259,I am now 134 kg i measured it yesterday
176180260,I lost my internet it was not payed for a long time created new internet account it will be back soon Going to get script later. Also get medical recrds sent to other practice sorry if anyone was worried. My internet cut out at the most funny time. I am better than ‘him’ in everway. Thats how i feel when i play checkers with my father
176180261,That all struck a chord with me for sure.
176180262,"Hi everyone, Well, to make a long story short, the funeral was on Saturday morning, and rather disappointingly, not very many people showed up. But, my Mom really wanted it to be mostly for _NAME_ and I. I think for the most part I’m really relieved that she’s gone and we don’t have to be worried about her anymore. There’s still going to be a lot that needs doing and I just have to pace myself. I know it’s been since last Tuesday since I posted anything about it, so I’m just checking back in and updating everyone."
174388360,I used to be on that combo. They put me on prozac for ocd the other day but its giving me fast heart rate. I dont even know if prozac is good for ocd
174388362,You’ll never know if it works for you unless you try it.
174388355,"On my first week of Geodon down to 20mg/day (I was at 80mg/day when I stared 3399 six months ago). Still have no positive symptoms that I can tell, it’s still like I no longer have SZ. Also worth mentioning that this is in spite of a hellish past week… I had some teeth go south a couple of weeks ago. I’m on a high dose of blood thinners because of problems with A-fib and being at a huge risk for stroking out. Basically, if I get a nose bleed, I have it for at least six hours. This makes going to the dentist for an extraction a real problem. They started backing off my thinners last Sunday, which didn’t work out well. Monday morning I started throwing clots, which landed in my lungs. This is on top of having periocarditis, so it’s really damn hard to discriminate what the chest pains you’re having mean – thank heavens for the O2 sensor built into my Samsung phone. I got my arse to the ER when the numbers started dropping and I was getting woozy. They got clot busters into me in time an
d cleared the lungs out. No damage. Had the dental work done at a specialty clinic on Thursday that was able to laser cauterize the bleeding, so that pain is gone finally, thankfully. Still have significant pain from the periocardits and also pleurisy (apparently the virus in my chest got multiple organ linings). They’re hoping this will clear up on it’s own within the next week or two. So despite this stress, I’m doing okay symptom wise. Also got the green light from the many doctors involved to keep taking the 3399. They asked me to discontinue my sarcosine for a bit as they weren’t as sure about it. (Don’t know why?) Hoping to get back to work on Monday. I think I’ve watched as much Star Trek DS9 and VOY as I can take for the next few months."
176180263,"Yup. That’s right. Going back home. I’m pretty excited. Butterflies because I don’t like traveling but other than that I’m pretty happy and excited. I can’t wait to get back to my old life. Kind of my old life, kind of new. I’m selling everything I’ve bought since I’ve gotten here and only taking back what I came with so I can fit in the same vehicle I came in. I don’t want to get a moving truck. The furniture I bought isn’t worth moving. I’ll miss my desk though, I like my desk. Oh well, I can buy another one later. My sister is thinking about making a job change so she is fine with me leaving because she thinks she’s leaving too. And where she thinks she’s moving is only 2 hours away from home so we potentially can see each other for holidays and such. My ex-husband is letting me stay with him temporarily while I wait for an apartment to open. I’m very thankful he’s letting me come back home. I miss my kids so much."
174388359,What dose of abilify are you on ?
174388365,"40 years, five hours, 20 minutes and 6 seconds. But I don’t really pay attention to stuff like this."

176180277,"Neither black or white, but a mixture. On the one hand, children are beautiful and cute and on the other hand, they’re a lot of work and a lot of worry. I think it’s best to have a definite plan on how you want to raise your child and what values you want to give to them. It’s nothing to go into blindly."
176180278,"And if anything else comes up (thoughts, feelings, sounds, smells, tastes) then you can be mindful of those, too."
176180279,Those options are all pretty unrealistic if not impossible.

But yeah initial few month lots of side effects, drooling, jumping on bed while a sleep, feel like right upper part of my ear bleed, 3D dreams it used to seem real more than reality. Plus low BP and diabetics which came in as discounts I had hard time to get adjusted to meds. That is the only reason I dont want my meds to be changed."

174388371,You just have severe negative symptoms which is rare like 15-30% of schizophrenics. I have severe negative symptoms and stay 90% of my time in bed. Can you play video games? You can pass time and maybe make online friends to play with them. Its as easy as just playing the game with them.
176180298,I honestly can’t even remember how to play Chinese checkers. It was really fun when I was a kid.

And why can I still “enjoy” so much. Eg music. Ideation of dreams or visualisation of dreams Idk. I don’t think schizophrenia can allow someone to have nearly two years almost symptom free. It seems to forgiving. I’ve asked for a doctor change. My current one has me written as psychotic disorder and not schizophrenia but the last time I was hospitalised, the dr of the ward, she straight up had it written schizophrenia. And I definitely agreed. Idk what to do. Who recovers from schizophrenia so well? I should be happy. And I am. But then. I’ll relapse won’t I? Idk what’s going on."

176180310,Are you better now on meds and with experience? I got out of it with help of meds and my parents. I attacked my brothers with knives in the past. My mother told me that when I was 6-7 y.o. I attacked my cousin with a knif too.
176180311,Sounds like you have a good shot. Where are you from? Do you work now?

176180320,"I tend to want to “snap out of it” in regard to my mental ills. In reality, however, it requires a lot of patience and carefulness to watch the small shades of improvements that are happening to ourselves. I’m suggesting vigilance because I do notice improvements in myself and others on this forum. For one thing, if someone asks me to do something for them, now, I feel much more able to do it. Before I would be flooded with thoughts about not being able. I still get those thoughts, especially about cooking, so it’s a working effort that I have to keep at. Here’s where having time helps. So give yourself a lot of time and good luck."
176180321,"At the hospitals I’ve been to, they discharge you asap, as soon as you are no longer a threat to yourself or others. I’ve been hospitalized eleven times over the past 19 years. My typical stay is 4-5 days. My shortest stay was 3 days, even though I was still quite psychotic at discharge, my first psychotic break. I demanded a discharge, and I think the doctor discharged me because he knew the only way I’d accept that these things I thought happened were just delusions was if I saw it for myself. And yeah, that was what convinced me I’d been psychotic. Hell, I still was psychotic, just not as acutely so. My longest stay was 8 days, and that’s only because I sort of attempted suicide in my room a couple nights in. They put me on one-to-one and moved me from my normal room to an isolation room, though they encouraged me to stay out of the room as much as possible, so it’s not like I was locked in there. Also, I had to wear paper gowns for a few days; they took my clothes away, other than s
ocks and underwear. Oh, good times lol."

I use manipulation as an important card when I’m in the hospital but most of the time I’m honest. I also feel a lot of empathy, especially for children and old people."

176180375,"That’s a good idea, I have found that “clustering” my actions helps too. So like if I am already up I will try to do everything before I sit back down. Or if I am already out of the house I will try to run all my errands. Also I find that once I make things routine I have an easier time doing them. However when I get thrown off my routine it can take me ages to reestablish it like how I am with teeth brushing right now. I asked my boyfriend if when he brushes his teeth he could get me to come do it with him. Sometimes I get energy to do things when he is with me like leave the house when I wouldn’t have the energy to do it on my own."

Sexual reproduction is the best way for a species to move forward because it gives the whole species a better chance at surviving those tiny beasts. For the record I thinks sz and related disorders aren’t special. They are kinks in the process that aren’t too beneficial but the real drama is super bacteria and super virus’s now. The plague really did a number years ago. So…after that education. He’s still half the problem!

Lived with grandma, so history was different. He Maybe even texted her. Never found out except I got schizoaffective disorder. He said I had that. I was in constant denial and disbelief. Felt the government gave me schizophrenia despite no evidence, just memories or feelings. So what? Probably thought I was a time traveler and believed we lived in the matrix and I’m stuck on repeat…was told I always had schizophrenia. The guy on TV or projector said that… Anyways, I wanted to go to _PERSON_ or whatever but found out it’s for rich people and Harvard students, which I am not. Plus, you dont need to go there to get excellent treatment. Probably pissed my regular psychiatrist off. They are competent enough. I had disbelief and I was originally diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder anyways. Full circle? My mom believes in this stuff. 
She got really into keto. Lost a lot of weight, back pain stopped, and her inflammation decreased. It may have helped me, it might have not. I dont remember at all. I think it did…but that diet is a pain in the ass. You have to grow up in a normal household for that stuff to work. My stepfather disrespects my mom. My mom is broke. Maybe in the future I will try it. 5+ years from now, hopefully. I’m not really a health nut and I’m more of a microwave kind of guy since the illness hit in 2011. I heard some people hire nutritionists but not sure if Medicaid would cover it. My dads insurance would never do that not even give uber rides. They laughed at me practically when I called. I could go on for a thousand years. I’ve met thousands of people in my past lives if you include near infinite amount of past lives. I rather not talk about people. That’s one of my rules. I prefer a normal life. It’s not right. I think science or mental health is lagging. I was cured a few times out of billions of lives. P
robably in the future but it ain’t profitable for most. Probably military has the cure in my opinion. If not, they probably will cure it in the future. I was given pills. Not sure they even worked. But if I was cured, I will feel great and achieve great things for myself. :End delusion."

Increases wakefulness. Reduces anxiety. Increases energy. Reduces drowsiness even after less sleep. Is these kind of effects come from sarcosine or any thing new?

They attacked my character and ended the friendship. When big things happen for you guys, what do you do to preserve yourself?"
176180431,_AT_MENTION_ I have a “normal” life. You can do anything. It’s these episodes that make it hard. My husband didn’t know I heard voices until recently; I never had to tell him b/c I managed to manage

176180451,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Predictors of disengagement from cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis in a National Health Service setting: A retrospective evaluation. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_ White, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, The British journal of clinical psychology , Jun 2019 10 To evaluate whether demographic and clinical variables are related to disengagement rates in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis in a clinical setting.The medical records and symptom severity data (from Health of the Nation Outcome Scales) were analysed retrospectively for 103 referrals for CBT for psychosis in a National Health Service secondary care and Early Intervention in Psychosis team.Overall, 42.7% (n = 44) disengaged from CBT. There was no impact of gender or ethnicity, and no impact of clinical variables such as risk history and comorbid diagnosis. However, risk of disengagement was significantly higher for those who were younger, F = 6.89, partial ?2 = .064, p = <.05; those with greater 
total HoNOS scores, F = 4.22, partial ?2 = .04, p < .05; more severe symptoms on the HoNOS items of overactive, aggressive, disruptive, or agitated behaviour, ?2 = 6.13, p < .01; problem drinking or drug taking, ?2 = 7.65, p < .05; depressed mood, ?2 = 7.0, p < .01; and problems with occupation and activities: ?2 = 3.68, p < .05. There was a non-significant trend for shorter waiting times to be associated with greater levels of disengagement.These results indicate that it may not be psychosis per se that disrupts engagement in CBT, but linked behavioural and emotional factors. A more assertive approach to these factors - overactive, aggressive, disruptive, or agitated behaviour, problem drinking or drug taking, depressed mood, and problems with occupation and activities, particularly in younger people - may be valuable prior to or early on in therapy as a means of increasing engagement in CBT for psychosis.Risk of disengagement from CBT for psychosis increases with overactive, aggressive, disruptive, or agita
ted behaviour (54.9% vs. 30.8%), problem drinking and drug taking (61.1% vs. 32.8%), depressed mood (56% vs. 30.2%), and problems with occupation and activities (53.3% vs. 34.5%), with a trend for younger age. An assertive and motivational approach to engagement and a focus on addressing low mood and problematic behaviours, prior to or early in therapy, may be warranted, particularly for younger people. This evaluation is limited by small sample size and being retrospective. These results speak to the question of whether psychosis itself renders people inappropriate for CBT for psychosis, or whether problems arise due to behavioural and emotional factors that might be addressed to increase access to CBT for psychosis."

176180459,"I’m not sure I can get rid of them but I’ve been told by my psychiatrist and psychologist that it’s best to keep them in the background and ignore them. When I look for them I find them, when I try to get rid of them they become louder and I find it hard to concentrate or hear myself or my “inner speech” because of the effort to suppress them. The voices are complicated and I try to detect tone in them. I also try to detect tone in real voices or audio if my physical hearing has something to do with the voices. Such as when sensory deprivation causes the mind to make up stimuli. I’ve seen results with this. I think this is the right way. My feelings change based on the content, tone, volume, and my understanding. Initially, I prayed fervently for them to stop. Then I tried to understand why that content or what voices were medically. I’ve tried to remove my anxiety of real voices by listening to the tone of others. This has also reduced the volume of the voices."

174388441,"Thanks for your response. I already have a tendency to not let my thoughts define me, I learned that a long time ago. Maybe I should clarify something else too: I’m not really affected emotionally by these thoughts, the main way I feel affected is that while they’re happening, it’s literally hard to manage to think anything else. So it’s like I’m in this weird trance of thinking insults to myself but not meaning it, and because of that, throughout the day I don’t have many useful thoughts. I just get the feeling that the tendency of my mind to generate these insults is an impairment, regardless of whether I mean them to myself or not. Also, I’d like to ask: when you say everyone has thoughts they disagree with, are you specifically referring to people with schizophrenia? Because I mentioned this topic to my mom, and she said she’s not usually thinking things she disagrees with."

176180470,"I pre-planned my cremation with a funeral home, and a pre-planning counselor filled out all my paperwork and e-signed it for me, which was fine with me. I told him at first I wanted to keep it under $1,500.00 and put it on my credit card which their brochure said they take. I also told him I has health problems and Sz which exclude me from life insurance. He emailed me a proposed contract for $895.90 for a direct cremation which I accepted. He had problems getting the system to take my credit card. I suggested we wait until March 3rd when my SSDI check goes in, and I could pay cash. He didn’t want to do that, so he finally set-up an insurance policy with monthly premiums. He only asked me if I had $15.45 in my checking, and I said yes. He then sent me an e-signed insurance application which I didn’t see until after he e-signed it for me. On the application there are no health questions if you pay in-full, but two questions if you do monthly premiums. He answered “No” to if during the last f
ive years had I been diagnosed or treated for specific medical conditions, when the answer should have been “Yes”. I received the policy and they won’t contest it after two years except for non-payment of premiums. It didn’t exclude fraud. I went on and paid the policy in-full March 5th. My sister was all bent out of shape over this, saying they won’t pay when I die because of the fraud. I just got a letter from the insurance company today stating my policy was paid-in-full with a death benefit of $900.40. I’ve got an appointment with a lawyer Friday to consult over the phone about this for $49.00 because of my sister. What do you think? I’ve paid cash of $895.90 to the insurance company."

The last two years I have had pretty much no positive symptoms due to finding the right AP after 6 attempts at various drugs - and I have been hospital free for 18 months. Now the psychosis has abated, underlying anxiety was identified and I am now medicated for that but I have no actual diagnosis of an Anxiety disorder. That’s what has happened since I was 17. Now they expect me to put up with being labelled autistic, which since been diagnosed I have been focusing on even the smallest of things between my interactions with other people in the past (Way back in some cases) where I am identifying these issues throughout my life, and I wind myself up about it. It has resulted in a complete re-evaluation of my entire life and I can see how the profile for ASC fits into my life experience and I am seeing how I was treated even as a child to be an incredibly harsh way to grow up even without knowing this detail until 32. I just don’t kno
w what to do. If I stick around for much longer with Health Services, I am not sure what they will do next.

176180529,"as usual, my solution for lack of motivation is a couple cups of coffee! Cause letting go of the prescribed medicine is such a huge risk to take. Sorry for the large copy and paste but see the section in bold Chapter 10 Effects of Caffeine on Mood _PERSON_ and _NAME_ CAFFEINE AND ACTIVATION THEORY Effects on Health and Behavior Also, _PERSON_ (1994) showed a 100-fold difference in “reliable” discrimination threshold (1.7 to 178 mg caffeine) between participants in a similar experiment in which discrimination was anecdotally but consistently based on perceived increases in energetic arousal and feelings such as “motivation to work.” Onset of these effects occurred at around 21 (10 to 45) minutes after administration. Using 178 mg caffeine (the smallest discriminable dose by the least sensitive subject and the largest dose tolerated by the most sensitive subject) in the next phase of the study, all participants showed significant individual and group increases in energetic arousal, hedonic to
ne, “magnitude of drug effect,” “motivation to work,” and feelings of “affection for loved ones,” “self-confidence,” “social disposition,” and “concentration” compared to placebo. The “magnitude of drug effect” was shown to peak 1 hour after the test."

176180557,"One thing you’ll want to do right away though, is establish yourself as helpful and compliant. Offer to help cook dinner, offer to participate in group activities, offer to help do the shopping, etc. The group home life can get pretty boring at times, so take advantage of whatever activities you can do to help pass the time. The more you establish yourself as a positive contributor, and the more you show good behavior, the quicker you will graduate from the home."
176180558,"everybody used to tell me to move to _NAME_, texas when i was in my 20’s. _NAME_ isn’t conservative, it’s one of the most liberal cities in red texas. personally i’ve never been there, but my sister lived there for a couple years. texas, judging by the recent election is experiencing changing demographics and may in the future become more of a swing state, much like florida. i have 2 aunts and some cousins who live in florida, and they said alot of liberals from colder states choose to move there, but they are outnumbered by more conservative transplants from the midwest. mom doesn’t like florida, she says it’s ugly, but i like it, some of the beaches are nice, and the humidity doesn’t bother me. that’s another thing about florida, is wait until you experience the humidity. some people can’t handle it, california is much drier so it may be a bit of a shock to you. of the two states, i would choose florida over texas, i’ve visited texas a few times, and i prefer more greenscapes, 
to the brown landscapes. what about a place like _NAME_? personally, i like swing states and ive thought about living in _NAME_, although it might be a bit too hot for me in the summer. the thing that prevents me from moving to florida is the hurricanes they experience. i don’t want to buy a trailer, which i don’t think would hold up to a strong hurricane, which only leaves me the option of a condo. another thing is i’ve never to been to the gulf coast of texas, so maybe it’s nicer there, but i wasn’t impressed with what i saw of texas. dallas, was ok."
176180559,"I have to listen to lies from people like that all the time. I resent the fact that crooked people mostly, made me poor. I think that if people were able to do things legally, I would have had plenty of money to live on, and they wouldn’t have to worry about where peoples money comes from. I think lying crooked people interfere in people’s lives, just to turn them into slaves and then complain about the health problems they cause."

176180567,Happy birthday _AT_MENTION_. Enjoy the day.
176180568,Exactly. That’s exactly it.
176180569,Yes I was thinking about you.
174388455,"Arguably my first psychotic experience was in early 2010, when I was 21. However, all it seemed to be to me was a spiritual awakening, and plenty of people have those and are not considered psychotic. Interestingly, my spiritual side has been completely undone by now. Anyway, I became clearly psychotic (in hindsight) at age 23, late 2011. I stayed that way until mid 2014 when I was hospitalized. I was only told I had psychosis NOS. I think it turned out that way because for the past 3 years I kept everything to myself about what I believed and experienced, so it wasn’t until I started acting out that anyone thought something was wrong. I wasn’t asked to describe everything I had experienced when I started treatment, if they had known it had gone on for so long and went so far they probably would have called it schizophrenia. But they didn’t, and after a year of treatment I decided I didn’t need to take my medicine anymore or show up to see a psychiatrist, and nobody forced me to continue. I 
felt fine with this because my understanding at the time was that I had an “episode” of psychosis, i.e. something that just passes. I went out of my mind again for two years, again because I was keeping everything to myself until I started acting out a bit, and then was brought in to the CAMH ER to talk to somebody. This time they didn’t keep me as an inpatient, they just set up an appointment with a psychiatrist, and once I saw him I was officially diagnosed with schizophrenia. I just accepted my diagnosis."
176180570,"There is no cure for schizophrenia because the onset is in the early 20s for males and early 30s for females. For those children between 1 and 18 years of age, how is a psychiatrist supposed to vet those children that will develop schizophrenia and those children who will not? It’s impossible. As one other user stated, developing schizophrenia is like developing cancer. You don’t know if you’ll develop the disease and medical therapy or medication is the only was to alleviate the symptoms. I agree with the medical professionals that the neurotransmitter hormones of dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine and nor-epinephrine are all somehow involved in the thought process of schizophrenics. Presently, anti-psychotic medication is the only way to block or inhibit these neurotransmitters from causing the brain of a schizophrenic from going into psychosis."
176180571,Thanks guys! I’m over the moon
176180572,"I take medication, but recently I had a psychotic episode. I have universal healthcare coverage provided by the government but I cannot register for private insurance, which will cover the out-of-pocket costs not provided by universal healthcare coverage."
176180573,Make it a daily practice and reap the benefits. I do 3x30 minutes a day. I love it most days and given my circumstances I am doing really well.
174388462,also -
176180574,I like it. That’s a very good piece. You are a good artist
174388463,I can’t blame all of my negative symptoms completely on the Risperdal. 4 years ago I was on a very low dose of my meds and I still experienced low motivation and anhedonia. I had a difficult time with my hygiene.
176180575,"I take 12mg of blonanserin, a fairly new antipsychotic."
176180576,"My symptoms were not mild and it managed to get rid of them. (aripiarzole) However as of yet I don’t have sz, but psychosis so that may be something to do with it. The thing with aripiarzole is it works by actually activating dopamine a tiny bit as oppose to blocking it completely. Idk how it still works even though it’s activating dopamine a lil bit, but it just works some other way to the typical aps. Unfortunately for some this then means that It can actually worsen their psychosis. I mean I did suffer with some crappy thought disorder and public people hallucinations at the onset of aripiarzole maybe that was to do with the fact that it was slightly activating dopamine."
176180577,Very interesting that he seemed British to you if he wasn’t.
176180578,Nope its me !!!
176180579,15151515…
176180580,well they upped my dose of APs mainly and they tried to keep the people i had the thoughts about a bit at distance from me. What I do myself is i try to not start obsessing over it… like try to get my mind on other things… it’s not easy though…
176180581,"I’m sorry you are struggling. If you are having a mixed episode you may need a meds change to increase your mood stabilizer. It’s terrible that you harmed yourself, I hope you’re ok."
176180582,"Nothing wrong with bread, dude. Maybe you can try switching to a multigrain bread. I found it to be an easy switch, because I like the bits of seeds and grains stuck in the bread. The texture isn’t for everyone though."

176180584,Early intervention with appropriate medication leads to better outcomes. It’s that simple. You’ll soon learn if you need it or not because side effects can be a problem. It’s a starting dose for sure. I do well on 10mg’s but I’ve had a couple of episodes so I’m statistically more likely to need medication for life.
176180585,I’m like this to some extent. Theres many careers I want to pursue bit can never find one to fit. But my hobbies do this. I think for me ite because I am also autistic.
176180586,"I had to research this for Mr. Star, so I thought I would pass along the info. _PERSON_’s mane and amyloban do not make you pop positive for anything on a drug test. It is approved for use by the millitary and the DoD. I have been feeling much better since starting it. One bottle has 180 pills, which lasts 90 days for me.

176180588,Well I snoozed my timer for one minute at least 30 times and it’s annoying enough that I just might get the f up now and get stuff done to sleep. I’m not turning it off. Will try timers tomorrow too. Thanks _AT_MENTION_

I need a bit of ho
pe again Does the most of my suffering come from too much ruminating? But my intellectual deficits are real… For long time I was like deaf and blind… My senses got affected too, you know… I just went closed in some small kind of hole which is my head, if you see what I mean… I was for longtime with my thoughts and just seeing my feet when outside… I guess its some kind of opposite of the openmindeness… I went closemindness but its very real - with all the intellectual and emotional deficits… Its too much in my opinion… I try to stay positive in the day, but I am afraid I went quite mad and ill, yeap… Should I continue believing in my efforts, pals? The meds didn’t prove me, that I am better on them, nope. They are just a maintaining help for me, but on my mind- nothing… Who else got better mostly with efforts? We need our meds, I know this, but when they don’t help much, what else can we have? The people are brave outside… The paranoia kills everything I find… And its not my fault 
to be a paranoid sz, I went through the guilt already… whatever… Otherwise, I recently watch the hbo series ‘‘Chernobyl’’. They are quite good. It was a big tragedy too, check it if you want, everyone Take care"

We conducted a systematic review to identify all cases of simple schizophrenia published until December 2017. We identified 42 cases of simple schizophrenia, 57% of which met all three diagnostic criteria (ICD-10, DSM-4 research criteria, and Black and _PERSON_ criteria for simple schizophrenia). The mean age at first contact with clinical services was 30.1 (SD = 11.6) years, with a mean delay of 7.4 (SD = 6.8) years from symptom onset to first presentation. An insidious onset and negative symptoms were characteristic features in all cases. Social withdrawal, alogia, blunted affect, lack of initiative/interest, and functional impairment were found in more than 85% o
f cases. Our findings contribute to greater awareness and understanding of simple schizophrenia, and have the potential to reawaken interest in this clinically distinct subgroup."
176180599,Ha ha ha ha Well a boring orgasm to me is short and boring can’t compare to the intense extatic one I can get. I have never had a intense extacy orgasm through masturbation but only through having a penis inside me but only two men have given me such intense orgasm. There is bad ice cream that doesn’t give so much satisfaction and one could do without and there is ice cream that is amazing and that makes one amazed that anything can feel/taste so good. I have had sex and been seriously amazed at how great it felt.ha ha ha kind of shocked me.unfortunately the guy was trouble and I was inlove with someone else.

176180654,"Try joining MyFitnessPal or Sparkpeople and entering your goals into their algorithm to see what calorie range you should be targeting. That will give you a better idea of how to structure your nutrition. One meal a day is too little. Eating too little can do just as much damage as eating too much. You don’t want your metabolism to shut down. I don’t cook from scratch either. I eat a lot of peanut butter sandwiches, Morningstar Farms black bean burgers, _NAME_ chipotle bowls (soy based, comes in pouches where you buy the canned stews and foods like that), Tasty Bite Indian meals (come in pouches in the international foods aisle), and frozen chicken tenders. I eat Clif Bars, granola bars, instant oatmeal, and belVita breakfast biscuits. None of that is hard to make, even though it could be less processed. It’s working so far. I don’t eat hardly any fruits and vegetables - they always rot before I get to them - so my diet could stand some improvement too. I’m losing weight though, so I’m 
not arguing."

To find causal relationship liking a causes and result,there must be a correct knowledge /definition of the result (psychosis) A causal relationship that combines anatomical /chemical changes that be taken as a causes,and the emergence of the psychosis which is taken as a result of the changes But they explain the psychosis as (people have difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is not ) ! This definition in itself is not enough to make you find out the chemical roots of the schizophrenia condition or its symptoms because, in the nature,the indep

176180657,"Worse, I was invisible for four years. Ignored. Overlooked. I kind of contributed to it, so I can’t fully blame anyone else. There were isolated incidents where older, popular kids threatened me verbally or physically. But I mainly got by not talking to anyone and trying not to look at anyone. I did a few things that were semi-cool. For about half a year I hung around in the main gathering area with my friends. This was a large area in the middle of the school where the majority of the school hung out at lunch and breaks. We might have even have been considered a clique. Our little group hung out right near where a bunch of popular kids hung out. I started smoking pot at school with my friends around 10th grade. The school designated a grassy area in the back of the school as a cigarette smoking area but all the stoners hung out there and smoked pot and so did we. In fact by 12th grade me and my friend started selling pot there and a lot of people knew us. We sold single joints and dime bags. I g
ot known and we got to party with the most popular stoners. I did a couple other cool things but no matter what I did I was still really an outsider. People tolerated me but I only had two or three real friends in four years and rarely talked to anyone in my classes."

176180694,"I keep having mood swings. One minute I feel happy and relaxed then I’ll get a thought pop into my head about things and my mood takes a dive and I feel sad and anxious. I’m making plans to go do things and am uncertain if I’ll want to go because of the mood swings. I take a mood stabilizer, but it isn’t very strong. Other mood stabilizer I’ve tried didn’t work for me. I wonder if I could increase the Topamax and get more mood stabilization from it and calm down these swings. The others I’ve tried are Tegretol, which really sedated me, Lamictal, which I had a bad reaction to and Lithium, which I went toxic on. Are there others that I could try? What do you use?"

I have costochronditis, which I’m not medicated for. I’m getting worried more every day. Most living around here work in the hospital. They’re nurses, anesthesia, doctors, retired people. Also this county hosts a celebration every year akin to Woodstock and many people out of state come to it to get drunk, high and have sex. I don’t know what they’ll do about them.

176180703,"Invega can in fact cause high prolactin. It’s actually a fairly common side effect, although it obviously doesn’t affect everyone. Not only did my psychiatrist warn me about it years ago, but once it started happening, he recommended me to get a bone density scan, because high prolactin can cause osteoporosis, which has happened with several of his patients that have taken this medication. The physician I went to is also certain that it’s the invega causing it, because they did a test for pretty much every cause, and ruled out everything other than invega side effect. Just because it doesn’t affect you personally does not mean it can’t happen."

She put my meds in the strangest place, behind a clouded glass door in the kitchen dresser. Next to some chocolate. She later accused me of eating her last chocolate repeatedly, and after an hour of looking for my meds she saw them through the glass, at which point I knew what chocolate she had been talking about. 2 weeks ago she looked at a blue ornament and remembered it well, that she had bought it for herself because she thought it was beautiful. Today she asked me about it because she had no memory of having seen it."

176180707,"So the day of graduation is upon us. I’ve been waiting for this day for awhile. We have relatives coming from out of town to be at my son’s ceremony. Then my daughter’s baby shower. Then I just need to be up and around for visiting and whatever activities come up. They leave on Sunday early I presume since they have a long drive home. Then comes the hard part. I will be telling my husband that I’m leaving him and my family that I’m moving 8 hours away. Of course I won’t be moving for a couple months, but they need time to get used to the idea. I’m so nervous. I feel like everyone is going to be mad at me and not understand that I need to make myself a priority right now. I guess I would be mad if I was them too. Oh well it doesn’t change anything, let them be mad. Once everyone knows, I still have the difficult task of selling everything I own and when it gets closer I need to find safe transportation to my new city. I have some people in mind but I haven’t been able to ask them y

176180712,"Welcome to the forum. Just to let you know, we do not allow discussion of drugs and alcohol except in a recovery manner. We have members who are recovering alcoholics and this type of conversation is triggering for them. As for your question, weed and alcohol can trigger psychosis. It’s a good idea to stay away from both. Alcohol is also known to interact with antipsychotics. Not only that, the liver metabolizes medication and also booze. That means drinking makes your liver work even harder. So yeah, occasionally imbibing is ok according to some pdocs, but most agree that staying away from weed and alcohol will keep you saner and healthier in general."

176180715,"Psychotic episode Imo includes disorganized thinking and speech, its more like your thinking pattern shifts into distortion and you “can” differentiate between reality and delusions but the judgment is clearly off."
176180716,I think they’ve moved away from the individual labels to a more simple approach namely treatment. As sz people can present different symptoms something like the DSM is there as a guide. There is still an art to psychiatry it would seem.

IS _PERSON_ and A _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Dec 31 2019 Psychosis augments the risk of homelessness, the latter is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Young adults experiencing first-episode psychosis (FEP) are increasingly recognized as being vulnerable to homelessness. However, data on homeless in youth with FEP are sparse.To compare symptomatic and functional outcomes in homeless v. never homeless FEP, at admission and two years after admission to an Early Psychosis Intervention Service (EIS).From October 2005 to April 2011, 167 FEP consecutive admissions (aged 18-30 years old), were recruited in a 2-year prospective longitudinal study in an inner city EIS in Montreal, Canada. Socio-demographic characteristics, symptomatic and functional outcomes, as well as treatments and service use data were collected at admission and annually.26% of FEP were homeless, prior or during the follow-up. A
ttrition rate was similar among the two groups. At baseline, the homeless group were more likely to have childhood abuse, forensic history, non-affective psychosis, negative symptoms, substance use disorder and cluster B personality. Despite the intensive care of EIS, the similarity of illness severity at baseline and medication adherence rate, homeless FEP had poorer 2-year symptomatic and functional outcomes, although having more long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI) (vs oral antipsychotics), community treatment order and hospitalizations.Homelessness is a serious and prevalent phenomenon among FEP youth associated with worse symptomatic and functional outcomes. More studies on interventions focusing on potentially modifiable factors (e.g. substance use disorders, social support) are warranted."
176180731,That’s probably the best you can do. I am getting a lot of side effects that are beginning to do me in as well but I remember some of the things I did on the AP’s that I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to do in the past and it gives me some solace. It’s not an easy thing.

176180770,It kind of is testing you but you need relief from it. So see your doctor and do what he/she tells you. I have the same thing sometimes- voices telling me stuuff- evil. I know what helps me but it is not really clinical. Don’t you wish it would stop? I do. Its Ok for a while then something just opens the door. I thinks it’s their working on me that does it. Do you know how to close your door to them? I think that is something we all need to learn. I sniff personally and I get much comfort from it. Try it as many times as you need. Hope it helps.
176180771,I’m sorry you feel that way _AT_MENTION_. You’re not a failure. I have major depressive disorder which unfortunately causes me to often have feelings of worthlessness. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression?

Main bad patch was between 2013 to 2018 Amisulpride saved what was left of my life. I am trying to rebuild myself back up. The trouble is my first episode ruined me for two years, then there was a gap of a couple of years where I learnt how to do Landscaping, then I did my degree and had more psychosis, and was unable to do a masters or PHD. Then for 5 years it took me all that time trying different medications, whilst always refusing Clozapine due to side effects of weight gain that I did not want. I had my drivers license taken off me 2016-18 and that was a nightmare. Basically all the setbacks from Schizophrenic episodes I think has probably completely ?????? up my potential in at least two career paths. I used to be really intelligent, but now my mind works in a very complex way and I find things difficult with my concentration and other issues. No way will I share my defects with my doc

174388522,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Protein-Protein Interaction Network Analysis Reveals Several Diseases Highly Associated with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, International journal of molecular sciences , Jun 2019 18 Based on clinical observations, women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are prone to developing several other diseases, such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. However, the molecular association between PCOS and these diseases remains poorly understood. Recent studies showed that the information from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis are useful in understanding the disease association in detail. This study utilized this approach to deepen the knowledge on the association between PCOS and other diseases. A PPI network for PCOS was constructed using PCOS-related proteins (PCOSrp) obtained from PCOSBase. MCODE was used to identify highly connected regions in the PCOS network, known as subnetworks. These subnetworks represent protein families, where 
their molecular information is used to explain the association between PCOS and other diseases. _PERSON_ exact test and comorbidity data were used to identify PCOS-disease subnetworks. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the PCOS-disease subnetworks to identify significant pathways that are highly involved in the PCOS-disease associations. Migraine, schizophrenia, depressive disorder, obesity, and hypertension, along with twelve other diseases, were identified to be highly associated with PCOS. The identification of significant pathways, such as ribosome biogenesis, antigen processing and presentation, and mitophagy, suggest their involvement in the association between PCOS and migraine, schizophrenia, and hypertension."

If I get recertified will use that time to continue to improve myself. I’ve already accepted that there is a strong likelihood I’ll be done with benefits but my pdoc or therapist never said I could go back to work even after me asking the pdoc every time I see him to which he never gives me a straight answer. I believe he truly cares so maybe he doesn’t want me to go south again. I won’t be working a glamorous accounting job but maybe something relatively simple like janitorial work."

176180863,It certainly is for me.
176180864,I’ve come down on my antidepressant recently. I think things do improve with age…it has been reported but I think my symptoms whilst still there really are better.
176180865,yea i think you gotta give it some more time. Maybe it will change for the better. If you keep feeling different i would talk to your pdoc about it again.
176180866,I’m very ashamed of it. I still don’t believe I have it. I do need APs though so I take my medicine
176180867,No purging. Will see my pdoc next week. I will ask him for a referral to eating disorders specialist. I’m tempted to purge bc I don’t want to gain more weight but I don’t purge
176180868,I showed zero signs of illness until age 30.

176180870,"Sounds like you are having a tough time. I think for most it’s quite natural to want their own place at a certain age. I moved out when I got drafted by the army when I was 19, I never really moved back with parents full time after that. But there were bouts that I had to move back and it was unpleasant because they always interfered with what I was doing and I kind of became a part of their agenda instead of having my own. Don’t give up hope about moving out. You sound like a person that can make it when you are already making money on your own. Best of luck"

174388540,"I used to compare myself to my sister a lot. She’s not much younger than me, but she might as well be the older sibling. Husband, house, cat, car, job, goes to uni, spends time with friends, always looks like a million bucks. But she has her own struggles, and I’m sure she sometimes envies my more relaxed lifestyle. She’s always been very self-conscious and has had bouts of anxiety. And she has some lesser common, but severe, allergies that are causing her a lot of issues. I realised eventually comparing myself to her would do none of us any favours, because I am not her and she is not me. Our paths might look similar, yet lead us in different directions, and that’s okay. In the end, everyone ends up 6 feet under, and the worms can’t taste whether you had 1 dollar or a million dollars in your account."
174388542,My eye-opening moment - was when they actually said YES you have Schizophrenia. I sort of knew anyway - but had just spent 4 years locked in my own delusional psychotic world - cast off by medical as just being an Alcoholic - but it was a relief. It explained alot of the wierd _PERSON_ i had been experiencing - and now i had a label - i was able to research it and try to help myself. It was immense relief to find out it was Schizophrenia - and in fact i wasnt alone.

It is not the most socially acceptable habit, but there’s nothing sinister going on. He just likes practicing things like framing and lighting, and occasionally sees someone doing something that would make an interesting photo. Most likely, this person was just taking a picture he thought would look nice, then noticed you staring and realized he probably looked creepy, so he left to show you he meant no harm."

I assume in that case “their” part of the spirit is in action when, for example, my own mouth tells me “I will kill you”, or when it flaps my arms like wings while jumping up and down. I don’t think my subconscious does these things. There is no way of telling if and when “my” part of the spirit is in action, since the feeling that my body moves on its own is constant, and only rarely it behaves like I did (the spirit even speaks differently, than I did before this schizophrenia came)."

174388557,"So, I have been experimenting with different supplements for a few years, and I think I have finally found a few that have worked along with my medication. I will say that the medications I have taken work half way. They mainly keep me from having a manic psychosis which is great, but the voices never went away until about two months ago. Funny thing that I have always forgotten… I am anemic, so I thought one day that iron helps with anemia. I started taking that and it turns out my depression was milder and my energy to do things came back. Great first step until I started realizing a few things in my life was causing my depression. I have taken multiple antidepressants in my life too and NONE have had a lasting effect. I have even tried taking different choline supplements such as alpha gpc, citicoline, lecethin, and others but they make my ocd worse. So, one day I remembered that taurine can help with ticks for tourrettes. It helps with my anxiety completely but the ticks are still there, but 
the feeling of emotional set back and constant psychosis of people reading my mind doesn’t last for hours anymore. More like 10 to 30 minutes or less than that. I was taking vitaminshoppe’s brand and noticed my dpdr is going away slightly when I take them. So, I looked on the bottle and it said there was pyridoxine in it which I found interesting because I have taken that before and it made me feel overstimulated and weird. So, I try to take a 100mg tablet and the dpdr is just about gone and my depression is away. That didn’t last long though, as most medications and supplements full efficacy doesn’t last but for a few days before they plateau. So, I thought maybe trying different b vitamins would help. I experimented with quite a few of them and have found that thiamine, niacinamide, pyridoxine, and folic acid are helping so far. I feel like I have more energy and I am able to be coherent. Also, the voices are less frequent and is less numbers. I would usually hear from 80 to 600 or more voices in a 
day and now things are somewhat blissful to know I have my brain back. I have also been taking gou teng/ uncaria rhynchophylla. It works somewhat like abilify but less of a potnent nmda antagonist. So far I am still experimenting but I definitely can say something is working. Could be the b vitamins, could be the antipsychotic effect of the gou teng, but so far I am happy with the results and perseverance of how far I have come along. This was definitely NOT easy. And still, I want to thank everyone who has posted their experience with supplements because without them I could only go by clinical trials on the internet which explains only one aspect out of the millions of others’ experience with them."

174388561,I think if you’re stable enough maybe a schizophrenic could make a decent parent. I think a stable schizophrenic is better than your average alcoholic parent. And we know there’s plenty of those. No parenting job is perfect. My parents are complete normies but have messed me up in a lot of other ways. Not blaming them for anything just saying we all have issues. I dunno I just think I could make a decent parent one day although I’m completely still undecided and it would depend on what the woman I met wanted and thinks. The other day I did have the thought “I should never have kids”. But like there can be other supports in the family to help aid the raising of the kid if the sz parent had a bad day. I think a child would actually give me a lot of strength if anything. And I’d be more capable than the fool I am now if it actually happened.

174388560,"Hello, im new here. I got the diagnosis in 2014. Hospitalized for delusional thinking multiple times per yer until 2018 when i did all year with no exacerbation. Between the time i got sick and 2018 i have tried all available drugs for this condition on the market in my country, some of them helped to calm me down, others made me feel more delusional and in a state of feeling i am having hallucination because of them - like Quitepine for example. But none of them made my delusional thinking to go away. But not until i tried Solian, now when i start to think about all this, i cant say for sure is it the Solian that made me sane or it is just the couple of years being constantly sick and at some point after thinking about my beliefs - are they real are they not. But the delusions just went off. I feel like normal person again. Is that even a real life storie happened on others. To get cured from feeling as crazy. Occasionally when i get more than prescribed of the stimulant drug for my ADD and not sl
eep two days then get clonazepam and do the mix that is not recommended according to drugs.com , and then i start to feel slight feeling of paranoia like i am in some kind of danger but not sure from what or whom, most probably the police called by some person to report for a person talking at random people stuff they are supposed to hear and feel bad for their personality. Is this Schizophrenia attitude or just something else provoked by medications taken in doses bigger than prescribed. Also i hate at those moments how i can get calm or chill. Like feeling of Mania. But its like more likely state of being high because i am aware of the stuff i do are not apropriate and do the right thing - go home take an antypsyhotic and hour later start to feel normal but little not interested in doing activities. Also weed was a major psychosis inducing substance for me especially the USA strains so powerful that i was like hallucinating that the President is addressing me directly over the radio in my car. He had prepar
ed awesome speech exactly for me to be heard at this moment and make me feel great loved person. Anyway that of course is unrealistic to believe that the national radio is making conspiracies together with the other media, FBI, chosen individuals, and the whole county, against that person who drive on SF streets at night with a GPS device in his gas tank, being watched by city CCTV from the operation room in the god knows where, probably the county. But no i reallybeleived something really was happening in USA at that moment in December of 2014. I suspect the whole process has started maybe couple of month ago without my awareness and the in December i was at the point i have made connections to very important strategic entities, networks, company workers, i got messed everything in a coup for salad - my brain. HAH So this is gone now. Only that feeling from taking more than prescribed stimulant make me to feel i want to say everyone around me is so stupid that doesn’t deserve to exist.

xperience so i believe its just the feeling of the drugs and not a real psychosis. Where is the psychotic illness now why i got Cured?"

It bounces off your nicotine receptors and confuses them to say they are activated. Nicotine just inflames what 1/3 rd of the population has in nicotine receptors. You said you did it so go back and do it. Otherwise smoke. There’s no in between is all’s i""m saying. I smoked from 14 to 39 a pack a day. I know nicotine addiction. It was cost for me.

176180960,I don’t know but if you know for sure that psychosis causes it and you’re not sure whether ap’s do or don’t it seems like it would be worth it to take the ap to avoid the psychosis and take the risk of the potential brain damage rather than the certain brain damage of the psychosis of not being medicated at all.

Also if you do something daily its so easy to continue doing like that. Ex: brush your teeth soon after dinner. Not skip it even for one time and then brushing is so easy.

If you haven’t been doing things that could get you pregnant, it’s probably not a worry. I believe my doctor told me if I ever go more than 3 months between periods, I should call so she can write me a 7 day BC supply to induce a period.

176180971,I really liked my social worker. She only showed up once every 6 months. She seemed very surprised that I improved so much… I got a job and lost the weight I gained while psychotic and my negatives and cognitives had partially gone away by that time. Apparently I’m now labeled by most people in mental health as high functioning… which does make me wonder how it must feel like to visit dozens of less fortunate people. I think technology is a very good field to work in and your thoughts seem very clear. Here in Hawaii we have universal health care. Maybe you could become a teacher like freakonaleash… lots of jobs out there for stem degrees.

Still, I haven’t told all of my extended family yet or all of my husband’s extended family. I am gradually telling them. They are teachable moments.

I’m thinking about it and if she’s right and this is a trauma response I shouldn’t be on the medication I’m on. I’m worried it’s poisoning me now; like if I don’t need it shouldn’t take it. It took me three weeks of In patient to get help; after attempts of getting help in the past never worked. Now I’m confused. To take the meds or not? Everything is confusing. I haven’t shared my mental health struggle with many. I got told I’m too high functioning to be schizophrenic. I work; I lead; I parent; I talk; I drive; I study…it doesn’t make sense.

A lot of the people in the hospital I met during my clinical were sz who had come from jail for assaulting people, but it was not random violence it was out of “self defense” on their part. They were highly paranoid and freaking out and someone would ask them to leave the area or otherwise appear threatening to them and they’d lash out to protect themselves."

See if that helps you. When I was in a mental care home a few months ago, i had my worst one yet. Started in the morning and ended only at night. The voice was telling me that I had died and the care home was my new hell. That I was gonna be there for all eternity and I was gonna . suffer I was just planning to ignore. Then it kept saying it was gonna make me kill the other patients in there that were my friends. When I started ignoring that, it stopped letting me think. When i tried to think a thought, it would jump in with its words and not let me think mine. So I stopped trying to think and just kept watching. I fell asleep like that and felt great when I woke up next morning. Through the fires of hell into the beauty of heaven. Notice all the dangerous threats it makes are about the future. Essentially saying was 
gonna . All our fears are always about the future, not about the now. Focus on the now. Just watch the now during a psychosis and face the fear. Attacking the fear or running away never helps. Thats what animals do. Fight or flight. Human beings are more than just animals. We also have a formless mind that we can use to soothe our frightened physical brain.

176181122,"Thank you that makes sense. I often have this feeling without evidence that my mom use to rape me as a child, when I get delusional like that I get extremely upset with her and irritable and want her to stay away from me because I feel like she is attempting to do it to me again. When I was younger my father did sexually abuse me and my (first) stepfather (different step father then the one I currently have) was a creep and would get on top of me while I slept and peep at me while I used the bathroom, so I think I have ptsd from that.

People with psychosis NOS don’t always go on to develop SZ if they relapse. They might end up with any number of psychotic disorders. They might stay NOS if no other category ever seems to quite fit them. I’m just referring to the DSM definitions. NOS just means Not Otherwise Specified. Psychosis that doesn’t clearly fit into another diagnosis ends up there.

V Peritogiannis, _PERSON_ and A Gogou, Journal of neurosciences in rural practice, Apr 2020 There is a dearth of studies on gambling problems in patients with psychotic disorders. A retrospective chart review of treatment-engaged rural patients was performed. From a total of 79 patients that were included in the study, 6 had a history of gambling problems, whereas the 1-year prevalence was 5%. Most were male and they underreported their problems. The results of the study correspond to other studies that used more rigorous methodology. Gambling problems in psychotic patients in rural Greece are not uncommon. Such problems can be traced by gathering information from all those who are involved in patients' care."

176181292,"The now-disgraced _NAME_ once said: “90% of success is just showing up”. Go into this endeavor bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and with a good attitude. My dad once told me that having a good attitude going into a job is one of the most important thing you can do. He also said that 75% of life is having a good attitude. My own philosophy for success that I carried with me for years and years of job searching and being employed is simply that: “If I’m healthy and teachable than I can work.” That philosophy has served me in great stead for a couple of decades. And also keep in mind that being employed is not 8 hours a day of solid toil where you have to work as hard and fast as you can and grimly go all out or 40 hours a week. Sometimes you will be having friendly conversations with co-workers about the weather or sports or what an idiot _PERSON_ is. There’s plenty of times between tasks sometimes to just kind of relax for a few minutes and catch your breath. Or there’s lulls where everyth
ing slows down and there’s nothing to do and you stand around waiting for the boss to figure out what he wants you to do. It’s very possible to be employed even if you don’t have confidence. I’m definitely not confident, it’s not a character trait of mine. But given the right circumstances I can do really well at jobs (and college too!). Confidence helps for sure, but not having any does not preclude you from being employed."

176181313,"So my head shakes anytime I pause to think clearly. In the context of learning at school or while processing daily routine experiences or when meditating on things to say. It shakes in a disapproving way almost as if my body is fighting, resisting or denying my mind. I’m wondering if anyone has such involuntary symptoms? I found this definition on the net to illustrate what I mean by this gesture. Shake one’s head vs nod one’s head The terms shake one’s head and nod one’s head have been in use for hundreds of years, and the exact etymology is unknown. These expressions mean two different things, though their definitions are becoming blurred. We will examine the definitions of the phrases shake one’s head and nod one’s head, their probably origin and some examples of their use in sentences. To shake one’s head means to move it from side to side with a subtle _USER_ID_ of the neck. This is a gesture in most of the English-speaking world that means the word no, disapproval, or that the 
one who is gesturing is in disagreement. Many cultures outside of the English-speaking world also use the gesture of shaking one’s head to indicate no, disapproval, or that the one who is gesturing is in disagreement, though it is not universal. In recent years, the term shake one’s head has been used interchangeably with nod one’s head , using the phrase shake one’s head ‘yes’ . This seems to be a very roundabout way to communicate. The word shake is derived from the Old English word sceacan, which means to move something to or fro, quickly. Many anthropologists believe that the gesture to shake one’s head is derived from the tendency for a baby to turn his head away from a food source when he is full, indicating that he does not want any more sustenance. Related phrases are shakes one’s head, shook one’s head, shaking one’s head . The noun form is headshake. Note that shake one’s head implies control over one’s movements. A shaking head outside of one’s control is considered a sign 
of palsy or neurological problems, or a head shake may simply be a nervous condition. To nod one’s head means to move it up and down in a subtle manner, to slightly tilt it downward and upward in sequence. This is a gesture in most of the English-speaking world that means the word yes, approval, or that the one who is gesturing is in agreement. Head nodding may also be used as an informal, nonverbal greeting, a signal that someone is listening or an affirmation of someone’s feelings. Many cultures outside of the English-speaking world also use the gesture of nodding one’s head to indicate yes, approval, or that the one who is gesturing is in agreement, though it is not universal. For instance, in Bulgaria one shakes one’s head in approval and nods one’s head in disapproval. The word nod is probably derived from the German word knoton which means to shake. Many anthropologists believe that the gesture to nod one’s head is derived from the tendency for a baby to _NAME_ his head up and down when hung
ry, searching for a food source. If one becomes sleepy or drowsy, he is said to nod off . Related phrases are nods one’s head, nodded one’s head, nodding one’s head. The noun form is head nod."

176181347,So I know this is probably going to sound like my meds are not working right but I promise you they are. One of my last jobs my husband would go in and talk to my “friends” that worked their and they would record things I would say. I found out about it because one of the girls started to feel really bad about it and told me. So I would just say outlandish stuff to make him mad. He still lies about it to this day so I have dropped it for sometime now. Then this weekend he started saying stuff under his breath and seems to want to bring all this stuff up again. I know if I say anything to him he is just going to tell me it is all in my head and that I am crazy. I also had a relapse not long ago which he decided he was going to share with my family. I have zero privacy in my life. Having this mental illness and having someone do this to you makes you feel even more crazy because you have to question everything. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

174388681,"PDF Mental health Research Public, health professional and legislator perspectives on the concept of psychiatric disease: a population-based survey _NAME_ A _PERSON_ 1 , _PERSON_ 2 , _NAME_ 3 , _NAME_ 4 , _NAME_ 5 , 6 , _PERSON_ 7 , 8 , _PERSON_ 9 , _PERSON_ 8 , 10 , 11 , _PERSON_ 12 , _PERSON_ 13 , _NAME_ 8 , 14 Author affiliations Abstract Objective To assess which mental health-related states of being are perceived as diseases by psychiatrists, non-psychiatric physicians, nurses, parliament members and laypeople. Design and setting A population-based, mailed survey in Finland. Participants Respondents from a random sample of 3000 laypeople, 1500 physicians, 1500 nurses and all 200 members of the parliament (MPs) of Finland. Primary outcome measures Respondents’ perspectives on 20 mental health-related states of being as diseases, measuring the extent of agreement with the claim: ‘[This state of being] is a disease’. Results Of the 6200 people approached, we received 3259 eligible responses 
(53%). Two conditions (schizophrenia and autism) were considered to be diseases by at least 75% and two states (grief and homosexuality) were considered not to be diseases by at least 75% in each group. A majority (at least 50% in each group) considered seven states as diseases (anorexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bulimia, depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and personality disorder) and three not to be diseases (absence of sexual desire, premature ejaculation and transsexualism). In six states, there was a wide divergence of opinion (alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling addiction, insomnia, social anxiety disorder and work exhaustion). Psychiatrists were significantly more inclined to considering states of being as diseases relative to other groups, followed by non-psychiatric physicians, nurses, MPs and laypeople. Conclusions Respondents agreed that some conditions, such as schizophrenia and autism, are diseases and other states, such as grief and homosexuality, are not; 
for others, there was considerable disagreement. Psychiatrists are more inclined to consider mental health-related states of being as diseases compared with other physicians, who, in turn, are more inclined than other constituencies. Understanding notions of disease may underlie important debates in public policy and practice in areas of mental health and behaviour, and have implications for resource allocation and _USER_ID_. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024265"

I think having a solid support person is really important, though. And keeping regular appointments with doctors and therapists. And having a therapist or similar is very important. When I was having issues, my therapist was usually the one that noticed and got me help before things got bad. I also did Healthy Families (if you’re in the states) and they have someone come to your house once a week and teach you things. It was really helpful.

In a later episode I had a persistent inert delusion consisting of living in gods dream. I was also troubled by delusions of guilt or sin, but did not act on those other than expressing them to my nearest. Most of them affected me emotionally or simply by me being preoccupied with them, and astounded by them. They consumed my attention but I managed to function as I did without them. Like one could be preoccupied with daydreams during simple tasks I would be delusional during all tasks. Most troubling were intrusive taboo thoughts, for the fear arose in me that they would lead to action. This goes back to the notion that ordinary thought leads to ordinary action, and analogously that thought beyond my co

I’m still pretty sharp but maybe it’s just the med cocktail they have me on works for me. Some dulled me when I was still looking for the right combo and some didn’t help with delusions.

I quit taking the stuff, but it was still in my system for a long time, and any time we went to town I had to make sure I knew where a public toilet was, because even though it wasn’t predictable, when I did have a bowel movement it was huge.

176181576,"ah yea, that sucks. I watch a lot of tv and it’s part of my routine. Can you go for a walk? Maybe that will make your mind clearer, like with getting some nice outside air. I can’t go for walks alone cause i’m scared all the time but i go with my dad instead."
176181577,The national unemployment rate is 13.3 percent. That is sky-high. I would expect it to be a joke looking for a job right now. Before I got disabled I was looking for work during bad times. It was too frustrating and not good on my mental well being to be looking in those conditions. I personally believe that during bad times people are better off not looking during that time and just waiting. That is if you are somebody that can afford to do something like that.
176181578,I was on 1.5mg of Vraylar and ended up going to the psych hospital. Discuss with your doctor.
176181579,Please don’t take a handful of Klonopin. Can you go for a walk?
176181580,marking dog as family and nature. Gaming and D&D I’ll count as friends and activities I really enjoy D&D and I enjoy talking to people on twitch. I enjoy my dog immensely and smooch cuddle and hug on my dog all the time. Next month I’m going to see where I’m at money wise and see if I can’t join the local YMCA for swimming hope I can afford for my brother to do it with me.
176181581,"Ah that explains why my last post got denied. I figured that had something to do with it. And yeah I heard it takes 150 to 300 days. I feel like i’m having 15 day average half lives though because of the 10 hours of sleep i get around those times, so i’m hoping i can be fine in about 4-5 months. alot of people report a difference at 6 months though which is good to hear. I don’t want to have to wait a year or more lol. also glad to hear you’re doing better. Never heard of Aristada though. what’s that about?"
176181582,No. Isn’t that what the guy in the painting is doing?
176181583,"I think I am getting really unwell but I don’t feel any psychosis just feeling very very stuck. I literally feel like I am lifting a hundred pounds around for every action I take. I sit for hours on end during the day needing needing needing solitude and I can’t do anything. Well it’s taken me 4 days, 4 attempts to do food shopping at a grocery store and I ended up doing it at a pharmacy last night. I’m trying to do a half normal amount of things for my family and it takes everything in me. I try not to tell them how sick I am right now. I have no motivation due to my meds and my husband overall is very supportive of that. This morning my husband asked me to take the dog to have nails trimmed today, then I put that on my little list with shower etc. I said I can’t today but I will try another day and he said he won’t be able to do it anytime bc of when he works. We talked about a couple of other things that need to be done, my mind started to scatter. Also he asked me to give him number
s from a book, I gave him the wrong ones, twice (when he called to correct it I read him the wrong numbers again) and he overpaid a bill $750, hard to explain. I couldn’t even do that right. I started screaming, bellowing shrill… (I dont do that). I couldn’t control myself. I felt like my mind is broken. Like I have no control or usefulness of my mind anymore. Then I accused my husband of videotaping me because he was holding his phone. These are very simple tasks but I can’t do the simplest like showering or brushing my teeth. It’s gross. I’ve struggled for years with this now. Since I got sick. Why is this getting worse lately??? Will it stay this way? Will I be able to shower and exercise and do a couple of chores ever in a day? I’m in a ball on the couch and I know Im going to be worse today. I can barely move. I may go to bed. I have bp1, schizotypal, and GAD. I don’t feel depressed, my usual constant nervous physical energy is little down, not up. Anxiety doesnt feel that bad, like I’m 
not anxious over a life stressor like a bad situation. Someone looking at my life right now may be happy to have it. Any idea what is happening to me? I have my pdoc appointment and nurse appt coming up soon. How do I explain? I usually can’t articulate it well unless I write and I still find it hard to make concise etc."

I have my own car again, I am losing weight, driving myself places, running errands alone, volunteering twice a week, looking for a full-time job, keeping up with the housework…all thanks to the right med.

176181668,"What made you decide to take a testosterone booster? How long have you been taking it? That will definitely give you an extremely high sex drive but why do you want that? Sex hormones act on the brain like a drug; every human being is influenced in a big way by their sex hormones, and I don’t just mean sexually but in terms of their general behaviour, characteristics, habitual responses/reactions, and likes and dislikes. The very frequent masturbation and pornographic obsession you’re describing is almost definitely due in part to you increasing the drug-like effects of testosterone on your brain and body…so while we can’t necessarily say that is “bad” we can say that it isn’t exactly natural. But if you actually enjoy having such a high sex drive and being so fixated on pornography then that’s fine but by being so sex-obsessed you are probably actually reducing your chances of finding a girlfriend, since most women wouldn’t want a man whose mind is focused - and, in your own word
s, “addicted” - on sex. There is so much more to life and relationships than just that. You say you want a girlfriend not just for sex but most of all for companionship…in that case, I would really strongly suggest you try coming off the testosterone booster or at least reduce the amount you’re taking. You may experience some unpleasant withdrawal effects at first, so try to reduce it gradually, but I suspect you will feel better and truly happier in the long run. And remember, you will still have your own natural bodily testosterone supply so what’s the problem?"

Its difficult to focus on anything unless I put on music to drown out the thoughts. I have had issues with sexualizing people that I am not attracted to at all or saying racist and mean comments about people in my head constantly. I have had treatments for a drug induced psychosis but everything in my gut tells me its real. I hear voices telling me its a natural phenomena. I hear my own thoughts outside of my body and it feels like everyone can hear them if they are outside or in an enviroment where echoes are elevated. The voices tell me its not schizophrenia. They bash me for sexualizing people, threaten to call the police on me, call me ungrategul and disgusting. Ive develope

My acute phase which consisted of severe terrifying paranoid delusions and hallucinations lasted 10 years until my middle 50s. Then I went into recovery phase for the past 9 years. Meds have worked well for me. In order for any of this to be possible for you you have to have some hope and not let go of it. Hope leads to insight. Insight leads to treatment. Treatment leads to wellness. Meds alone won’t get you there. You need the support of friends and family. There is no replacement for the power of love."

176181698,Take care of what?
174388757,What you don’t seem to get is that negative symptoms can be treated with effort. No one has said it is easy. It’s hard. Very hard. But possible if you put effort into it. It’s a very good thing that strict restrictions are in place to avoid people just using negative symptoms as an excuse for medically assisted suicide.
176181699,my overall point and this is from someone that hallucinates on a daily basis but tries to work as well. Flexibility in a job is numero uno. I dislike explaining to someone why i can’t show up. But your symptoms are less i think and you struggle less so maybe a schedule would work okay for you. i do flexibility in everything. my volunteer job is come when you can. etc.

Many times I delete things because they didn’t hold my interest. That saves a lot of money. When I’m working (which will hopefully be soon again) I calculate how many hours I had to work to net that money. Would I be happy if my boss just laid that item on my desk and said, there you go.

And someone reliable who can take care of me, and has a good upbringing or developed good values, has good character and is not judgemental of my illness and makes me happy to be around them just as a friend. Having a good job and car are nice, but I feel like you have to find a guy you can stick with even if they get schizophrenia. And intelligence is attractive to me as well. I’m sure there are other good qualities in a guy that I’m just too stupid to think of."

You just have to have trust and faith that the person won’t judge you. But I’d definitely say unless you feel completely comfortable around this person and are getting signals that it’s ok to talk about this stuff, just be patient and wait a while. I personally overshare everything so I told my partner pretty early on about it, but my advice for others (that I don’t follow bc I suck) is to give it some time.

174388780,"here is an article i just read that i thought someone here might want to read, too… Here are some things you need to know about schizophrenia: If you have it, you’re forced to question everything, whether it’s real or invented by your own mind. You can’t overcome it with willpower alone, like _NAME_ in A Beautiful Mind. One in every 100 people will develop it, often in their early 20s, meaning there’s a chance you know someone who has it, even if he or she doesn’t seem schizophrenic at all. ADVERTISEMENT I was diagnosed with schizophrenia nine months ago, after a slew of other diagnoses—depression, generalized anxiety, anorexia, borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder—failed to explain the complexity of my symptoms. (Some of those diagnoses still stand, but others have been replaced by the newer schizophrenia diagnosis.) My doctors seem to t
hink I’m doing well—or, as they put it, I am “high functioning.” It started three years ago, when I woke up to a small rushing inside of my head—like when you hold a shell to your ear and can hear the faint crash of waves. I went into work later that evening, and everything seemed normal. I ran the register, I stocked shelves, I cleaned the bathroom and swept the floor. Then I started to notice that the voices of the customers sounded strange, as if a second voice in the background was trying to catch up. That evening, I had my first auditory hallucination, something that happens to 75 percent of people with schizophrenia. Later, I had my first visual hallucination—a man who grabbed onto me and whispered sentences that hardly made sense. He followed me home. I found myself convinced that he was there to kill me and could read my mind. More than that, I was entirely convinced this man was real. On Motherboard: What Schizophrenia Isn’t ADVERTISEMENT After that, my mind was never quiet again. I sto
pped sleeping regularly, and when I did sleep, I had terrifying nightmares about alien abduction. I grew paranoid about the people around me and started to disassociate. Gradually, I began to feel more and more like a balloon attached to a distant body. Over the next two years, I attempted suicide twice and was hospitalized six times, where nurses would give me gowns with no strings. At the time, doctors didn’t suspect schizophrenia, which affects about 1 percent of the population. I later learned that that 1 percent translates to about 2.4 million Americans—and that I was one of them. Returning to high school after my hospitalizations, I made up stories to answer the inevitable barrage of questions. I lied to everyone, save a few teachers, and tried to pretend everything was fine. As I graduated with honors and a sizable college scholarship, I tried to push past my mental health concerns—but they were unavoidable. After high school, I was living off of a checklist that I hung on my wall: Wake up Self-c
are (shower, brush teeth, etc.) Eat Dress Take meds Go to class Eat Take meds again Coping skills (breathing exercises, etc.) Take meds again Most days, I couldn’t manage to get through the list. I went off of the antidepressant I had been prescribed, and I turned to drugs to self-medicate. I was barely functional—I stopped brushing my hair and teeth, stopped washing my clothes. By the end of my freshman year of college, I had met every single mobile crisis worker in the area, and the emergency room staff knew me by name. ADVERTISEMENT Then, last August, at the age of 21, I was finally referred for a new psychological evaluation. It was a four-hour test. When the results came back two weeks later, my caseworker pulled the envelope out. “Your evaluation came back. You’ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia.” I took the envelope in my hand and pressed it to my lap. “OK.” “Well, aren’t you going to read it?” “No,” I said, “I don’t think so.” The results gave a name to something I’d 
already lived through. To be a high-functioning schizophrenic is to barely function at all. Following my diagnosis, I started taking antipsychotic medication. My first large dose left me with an intense but intangible feeling of fatigue. My brain became dense, like spongy bread that had failed to rise, and there was no amount of coffee that could make me feel awake. Soon, I gained 20 pounds—a common side effect of antipsychotic medications—and could no longer fit into my old clothes. Related: Treating the Elusive, Disabling “Flatness” of Schizophrenia I take medication three times a day; at night, I need a concoction of melatonin, Benadryl, and Vistaril to fall asleep. Though my medication has saved my life, it will also probably end it. Antipsychotics significantly increase the risk of developing breast cancer and diabetes. Just being diagnosed schizophrenic takes 20 years off my life expectancy, and the suicide rate for schizophrenics is eight times higher than it is for the general population. Ever
y few months, there’s a story in the news about a person with schizophrenia being killed by police. ADVERTISEMENT Even on medication, I experience auditory hallucinations all the time. Sometimes it’s background chatter; other times it’s white noise. Sometimes I can understand the voices, and sometimes I can’t. Often I find myself terrified that the radio can hear my thoughts. I have to pause and breathe my way through every thought, every action, separating hallucination from experience. It’s never quiet. This, the doctors tell me, is what a “high-functioning schizophrenic” looks like. I can attend university, as long as I keep my course load to three classes at a time. I can’t work, because it’s still hard for me to control my symptoms, but I don’t need to live in a clinical setting or a group home. I’m succeeding, they tell me, because my life has regained some normalcy. But to be a high-functioning schizophrenic is to barely function at all. From the outside looking in, I guess I seem 
fine. People seem surprised when they find out. “Wow,” they say, “I’ve known you for years, and I never would’ve thought that you…” “I’m schizophrenic,” I say. “You can say it.” When people do talk to me about my condition, they want to know what the voices sound like. They want to know I have more than one personality, or if each personality has a different hair color. (No, that’s not what schizophrenia is like.) They want to know if I’ve seen A Beautiful Mind. Schizophrenia is a lifelong, disabling condition, but there are no relays for this disease. There are no walks to end schizophrenia, no T-shirts that say, “I love someone with schizophrenia.” People look at me with fear, not empathy, when I tell them about my diagnosis. And although I have scars—emotional and physical ones—from this disorder, I do my best to hide them. After all, the doctors say I’m functioning just fine."

174388782,"I’m sorry. I think far too many pdocs think of the side effects as something to overcome with willpower alone. But we all know it takes more than that. You can force yourself to do things, sure. But that takes about 3 times as much energy as someone else. And you burn out faster. I used to be a big believer that you can overcome the negatives through hard work alone, because I was working hard to overcome my negatives. But then I made a friend who was pushing herself as hard as she could and barely accomplishing anything. Then she got a med change, and started working half as hard to do twice as much. So now I see. It isn’t fair to judge someone for doing very little just because I also work hard to accomplish my tasks. There are things beyond our control sometimes. I thought I dealt with negative symptoms before, but they weren’t severe. I COULD push myself to do more. I just didn’t LIKE to. Some folks genuinely CAN’T push themselves as hard as I can. And that isn’t their fault. It is 
a combination of brain chemistry, environmental factors, medication, and access to support. It also helps to have external obligations. After I moved in with Mr. Star, I spent WAY more time on hygiene. After we became parents, I spent WAY more time cleaning and cooking and staying out of bed on bad days. You don’t have anything that forces you to get up, other than you. And you don’t yet love yourself enough to use your own wellbeing as an external motivator."

176181835,"I wouldn’t say psychosis made me weak. For me it was the drugs that followed. The ap’s made me weak, and I think most people have a radar to pick up on this. In my experience most people will try to exploit you if you are weak, but thank god I have also have people treat me kind like the kind of people who have principles and maybe have a view to be extra kind to people that are struggling. Those people are my role models. That’s how I want to be. With time I have been able to become stronger. I am not submissive, but I am humble. I am thankful for everything I have and try to treat people right. I may be tough on people who are unkind and selfish, but never people who are weak."

It was nice for a while, but she was more serious about me than I was. I told her we were just friends, and she said she was shocked. We finally parted, and I don’t think she was any worse for the wear. The thing that made me want to stop short of a romantic relationship with her was that she told me one time her ex-husband locked himself in a chicken coup for two hours to get away from her. She said she was held by her fear of abandonment, and she couldn’t leave him alone. That stopped me short."

174388783,"From my research, this is what I have gathered about the genetic theories of mutation (or based on research studies on genetic mutations that are thought to cause schizophrenia) OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man- catalogue of genetic diseases) does not have an official entry on schizophrenia per se . Sure, there are multiple or perhaps dozens of entries on “schizophrenia, susceptibility to”, but it does not mean “this mutation causes schizophrenia”. There are no definite answers. Inheritance pattern is unknown Orphanet (catalogue of rare diseases) has only one entry on childhood schizophrenia but it’s just classified as “disorder”. No OMIM entry. Not solely genetic Some studies suggest that dopamine receptor genes can cause problems if they are mutated, leading to schizophrenia/bipolar disorder. Chromosome abnormalities can cause problems if they are deleted (for example, 22q11 microdeletion). Family members can inherit schizophrenia in a familial pattern but it’s not well u
nderstood Chromosomal translocation (i.e. chromosomes who decides to rearrange themselves for a stupid, unknown reason) can cause schizophrenia Conclusion: More research must be done. Nothing is “for sure”. Theories only; no definite answers at this stage of research. Familial patterns are understood but it’s not well developed. Thank you for reading."

Since I dont really get psychotic symptoms much anymore I figured it doesn’t make sense at this time to be on one longterm. pdoc said thats a risk I have to be ok with, she said some of her other patients do that. I have really good coping skills I developed over the years and used cbt and stuff for long time. and I have a great support system. So that makes it okay for me.

174388843,"yo, so I took ziprasidone again this morning. Honestly I get 0 sedation from it and it seemed to actually wake me up which is odd lol. It definitely calms my agitated thinking/feelings. 40mg a day is still quite low though as thats what I was told to start with before going up to 80mg, I doubt that is sufficient for acute psychosis. I dont really have much in terms of psychotic symptoms at moment as it seemed to of calmed down (no intrusive violent images and thoughts) I also woke up quite a bit earlier than usual and couldnt get back to sleep as I felt pretty rested surprisingly. I usually wake up very groggy. I read some studies on it. 1 Study said for schizophrenia that the effective dose was around 120mg a day up to 160mg a day. Also in some of the scientific literature it stated that it also is a potent partial agonist for the 5-ht , 5ht1a receptor which is serotonin. So it could improve mood im guessing. just writing this for a log cheers level"

174388830,"Hello everyone i want to share something,as i was diagnosed with Schizophrenia for about 8-9 years ago but now i am taking regular medication & my condition is quite well now but yesterday while i was alone in my home suddenly i woke up & tears were rolling down through my eyes but for no reason & i was alone i started talking to myself .First let me explain my condition from past few years before Firstly i used to have Cannabis daily cause it was the only way to escape pain & reality for a short period of time i was only happy when i am high so i used to intoxicate myself very often lets say one after another soon after some time after few months i heard a voice a female voice in my head but i thought it came from the building next door to mine…firstly i ignored that voice but soon i talking to that voice……it was fun for some time but after few months i became addicted to that voice ,i don’t how but i was communicating with that voice in a daily basis but i never saw her i told her that pl
zz come to see me in person…but she wont so i accepted it & was conversing with that voice but it only happens while i was being high & after some time different personalities were coming to me i mean as i was a loner with actually zero social connections i was having conversations with different voices in my head but they all have one thing in common they liked her voice & each of my personalities would to to impress her in their own unique way & each having different approach & abilities but all of it was in my head only… So usually when having weed i start talking to myself with a totally new person…and As i get more high i converse with a total of 5 or 6 different persons…& the conversation would be sparkling(to me HAHA)…then i later realized i have the power of implementing personalities from real world…okay okay i know what i am saying …just hear me out…suppose you are seeing movie you like in which i like a person or admired then i will implement his personality into me & same goes for 
the persons in real life…so in short i played different personalities when i am high& that’s why i miss weed so much but i have made contract with reality not to do anymore…lemme explain how my imaginations works sometimes i imagine that i am working at a cake factory & every day she used to come to my shop & when she will i just would just stare at her in slow motion(HAHAHA)…she will always come to me & ask for her favorite cake & eat & will go…& heart will go just zoo zoo zoo… sometimes my imagination takes me to beautiful girl who has a voice of an angel everyone wants to see her sing,she is a famous singer & i am just a light boy or whatever it called( hold the spotlight ) but there’s a _USER_ID_ as she is singing he every day notices tears cause the girl who actually sings is behind the curtains as he notices her she is the most innocent girl with a voice of an angel but the world doesn’t know about her … sometimes i think that i am a tourist guide at mountains drinking tea when suddenl
y a bus arrives & a beautiful girl was coming out of the bus & it was like love at first sight…fortunately their tour guide was suppose to be me…& as we were riding i just can’t take my eyes off …when we arrived at hill station she was bending over the fence observing the beauty of mountains & suddenly our eyes meet & she was blushing & had a smile … But yesterday memories began to come down on me as i was lonely for a long time but after a long time i actually have a real girl in my life & shes’s really pretty also but i just cant forget about that voice in my head & all the memories i had with her,i just cant get her out of mind even being sober i thought that after this many years i would be able to break free i just cant… & all but i like her & don’t want to miss this time… WHAT TO DO HELP PLEASE ??"

174388849,I was on medication for about two years. I came off five months ago. No delusions or hallucinations. But I can be paranoid for awhile then it goes. Plus other things like sleep issues anxiety etc. If you feel over time your hallucinations and delusions are going away then coming off them should be a good thing. Especially if your not at risk of hurting yourself or another. Most anti pyschotic medication can do more harm then good over time IV heard from alot of people. It’s not easy with schizophrenia because besides hallucinations or delusions you have negative effects as well. Like concentration. Not speaking much. Blunt effect etc. But you can have a look online at negative and positive symptoms and kind of see where your at. And maybe _USER_ID_ down some points to be aware of a pyschotic episode coming on or if not an episode of pyschosis. Schizophrenia can be complex. But I’m here if you want to talk about it anyway. As I have also came off meds and noticed things an experience things also

176182058,Not even close. I am not even in school yet!
174388842,I hope not. But I heard a voice that said I would. I heard other voices and truly believe they were government agencies. I just don’t think I’m schizophrenic. My boyfriend doesn’t either.

176182062,"I used to enjoy clubs back before I got ill. I still enjoy the music but I get really paranoid in clubs now without the booze crutches. The last two gig’s I was at were Metallica and a Pearl Jam tribute band and there was some pretty aggressive moshing going on It very much depends what kind of club you go to. If you go to an average club night playing chart music you’ll see alcohol for what it really is. If you go to a club event for an act you want to see people are generally all well mannered. (when you have to buy a ticket, that weeds out the people who aren’t there for the music) That’s not fair to say either. If you don’t like the music then you’re never going to enjoy it. That would be like me saying cricket is for idiots just cause I don’t enjoy it"

174388854,"My first prominent psychosis started in 1994 (around 14-15 yrs old), but I did not have a full-on psychotic break until February/March/April 2003. At that time I was diagnosed bipolar with psychotic features and put on Zyprexa, among other meds. It was a year or two later that the word “schizoaffective” was first used."

Sometimes you just have to trust your gut. _USER_ID_: Just to be clear, this doesn’t apply to any and every medication, but in this particular situation, I think it’s fair."
176182091,"Having also temporarily shared the J-delusion, like many on here, my eventual interpretation wasn’t entirely at odds with the fact that many on here have had the same idea. It’s such a universal foundation for a belief. A very in-touch individual who is predicted to come again at a time when things are really bad and help shape the world into a better version of itself in order to avert disaster. Maybe it’s not that we are or are not a fulfillment of the prophecy at birth, but rather that the existence of the prophecy itself encourages people to aspire to fulfill that template. Maybe anyone can be the second coming, and in a sense everyone is. “What would Jesus do?” Two weeks after self-diagnosing myself as the big-J, I decided that “eh - that’s a lot of responsibility and I’m not really interested in the job” - but the experience did wake me up to the fact that I do think the world could be better than it is, and I do think I could do a little bit more here or there to help make 
that a reality. Maybe write an op-_NAME_ for my local paper. Volunteer for the political campaign of a candidate I believe will help improve the state of affairs. Spend some time doing further education in areas of study relevant to things I deem important to the world. My life around the time of holding on to the literal construct of the delusion was…probably one of the crappiest periods of my entire life. I lost 13% of my body weight in two weeks and had multiple consecutive nights of no sleep because of stress around that and associated delusions. But ever since, I think the experience overall has left me a bit better of a person than I was before. So that’s my take. I don’t know if the second coming really will (or perhaps even did) happen. But I think the very idea of it can make the world a better place by challenging people to aspire to be greater than they currently are. And one last observation – the prophecies in multiple places caution against false prophets that come in his name. So chance
s are that if and when the real deal does occur, it won’t be under the same name as before. Perhaps in the spirit of that idea, we can all aspire to better ourselves and the world under our own identities. Heck, maybe the second coming is everyone collectively aspiring to do that, and not a single individual at all."

But if you dont like this attitude theres plenty of time to change it!"
174388861,"Suicide is more common than homicide when you have uncontrolled schizophrenia. Usually people who murder others have serious issues other than having bipolar or schizophrenia. Violence is very very uncommon with most people who suffer from mental illnesses. If you want scientific proof, I’m happy to provide them. Okay so you get voices that tell you to kill others. It is very different to have thoughts of harming others than actually following through. You can have a mental illness without being a psychopath. People who kill others are very rare. A very rare population of mentally ill people will murder others. Yes, you can hear voices that tell you to harm others, but only a very small percent of those people will actually kill others. I would be very cautious in saying that the typical mentally ill person is violent. That is not true."

176182099,Oh no… thats doesnt make us look good. The study doesnt mention schizophrenics specifically. The hospital pamphlets or other online stuff i read in the past said that only a small rare % of schizos are dangerous and most are likely to be victims. I was never dangerous myself so im puzzled. I think alot of schizos need compassion but oh well. Ive known 3 schizophrenics and they were in mental agony. They werent dangerous though.

I was that bad at one point like you said though where it became me getting drunk every other day. My boyfriend had like a mini intervention where he pointed out how much I was drinking and that he didnt want it to become an issue so then I limited it to just once a week at the end of the week and I have done really well sticking to that.

If you can do it and your ready try the champix/chantix. I couldn’t give up any other way and it was way easier and less traumatic than anything I’ve ever done. It was that easy.

176182143,"I got psychosis at 32, before that I was professional in sport and doing post graduate study. After getting Sz I got a job and devoted myself to it as a coping mechanism. It distracted me from my delusions. I was on all sort of AP’s and had many hospital admissions. I finished my thesis and got promoted at work, all while completely delusional. Then I got mood disorder as well and my diagnosis changed to SzA. My cognitive function fell off a cliff and I just couldn’t concentrate or handle much stimulation. So I had to retire at 44. Now I really can’t work or study. So everybody is different, but there’s no harm in trying and you might find it helps to distract you."

It’s impossible for me to socialize with just about anyone outside my own family. I don’t drive, and I had to accompany my mother to her heart doctor in a cab yesterday. I always dreaded going to that doctor’s office. Something about that place triggers negative emotions. In the office, the complete strangers in the waiting room had familiar faces and voices. That’s not the half of it. Also, the worst part is I am worried for my mother’s health. I’m also afraid when I have to go when she goes for a stress test, and I was told it will take four hours! Four hours in the waiting room for me, I guess. It’s in early October. I also have to go to three more of her cardiology ap

She always talks about how people are staring at her and that managment (particularly the one in charge the past few days) is targeting her and stalking her and treating her unfairly. She also hints at sexual harassment, but she accuses every male of that (I hate to say that but this is what she tells me, that ALL guys stare at her, this is what she says). Now, it is true managment is watching her. Because she plays on her phone all of the time and does NOTHING, or works EXTREMELY slow. The last two days I have been put with her and it has been hell. Last night at the meeting I got a compliment from the manager and she later said to me, “you know how [manager] was like, ‘Haldol good job,’ he is targeting me,” like ???? you. I work my ass off, you just walk around and do nothing while I am doing all the heavy bags of dog 
food. I know I can’t help her, and honestly as someone who also suffers from paranoia I feel limited sympathy, HOWEVER, she also brings this on herself bc managment does watch her bc of her actions (or lack thereof). I work as I know they watch the cameras. IDK what I am going to do if I am put with her tonight. I talked to the manager last night and he did separate me from her by putting her in one aisle and me in another, so maybe I won’t be put with her. He did say they are going to move her from the overnight as she cannot be trusted to actually work. So any advice?

I worked in behavioral therapy for six years, both before and after my diagnosis. Doctor patient confidentiality applies to caseworkers and behavioral therapists, too. We’re allowed to seek help for our own issues. You know what doctors are good. They’ll probably be glad to see you. But right now, I’m sorry but it sounds like you need the hospital. They’ll put you on meds, and see what makes you stable, and then send you home. Your husband can watch your son in the meantime. Do you have any close family or friends who can also help? I’m sure you know from your time as a caseworker that psychosis never goes away on its own. It gets stronger and stronger until it

176182246,I agree! With your symptoms and the delusions that seem to be non stop why hasn’t your pdoc gotten you successfully titrated on an AP by now?

176182296,Maybe you need a girlfriend? What meds are you on?
176182297,"Yes, I was diagnosed around age 24, got my stuff sorted somewhat, and was dating by age 29. Married at age 30. Had a kid when I was 32. Now 52 and still with the woman I married in summer of 2000."
176182298,"Once the meds started to work, how long did it take you to feel better from the trauma of being psychotic?"
176182299,I appreciate the bear hug.
176182300,Stick with what? Abilify or Vraylar?
176182301,I took a long bath and used the last of my CBD infused epsom salts. Felt much better after. But I didn’t wash my hair.
174388924,There’s my cure!
176182302,it’s 18:40 here now… soon i go watch tv and then take my evening meds and fall asleep watching the tv =p
176182303,Those that see a pdoc monthly or quarterly are lucky.
176182304,"Yeah I feel like I’m stronger because of this, what would you do without the coping mechanisms?"
174388925,"It’s not a religious principle. If it helps take it. If it doesn’t help or causes side effects, then don’t take it. I believe we need to put more emphasis on the context in which people become and continue to endure so-called mental illness. As with “physical illness,” medical problems are socially influenced and the social world plays a huge part in recovery and relapse. We should try to maximize the resources available to people, understand where their problems are and how to address them, help them find meaning in their experiences of madness and mental distress, help them finding purpose in living and consider other things that might help patients find wellness. In particular, I am very interested in nutrition and the therapeutic value of food and diet. I appreciate that there is not a great deal of evidence or research into nutritional interventions but think this is a very promising area and would like to see more research into this area. In general, I would like to see NIMH rescue 
itself from irrelevance and put more effort into looking at a wide range of different treatment interventions for patients rather than simply focusing on neuroimaging and genetics. We desperately need alternatives to offer patients who do not want, and do not receive benefit from much of what our doctors offer. Given that the prognosis of schizophrenia remains poor, what we are doing is not working. There are small concerted efforts to look at other models of care. The challenge is much of what would benefit patients will not come from psychiatry. The establishment is not going to bite the hand that feeds them."
174388927,Because when I take it I feel better. When I stop taking it I feel worse.

176182307,"Trapped here still, in the game, the illusion. I want to go home, I want it to stop. I’m missing a place of peace, I’m missing something that might not be real. A place I still visit in fever dreams. Woke up cold and sweating. This world is coming to an end and I want little to do with it, I don’t want to observe, I don’t want to experience. “Will he remember?” “Wake up” they tell me. Filling my head with thoughts I don’t want. They’re talkative today. Reality is melting and breathing, walls moving, if I concentrate I can almost see between the realms, flashes. I want to be infinite and eternal again. I want to be a singularity again. I want to be whole. Something deep inside is lacking and missing. A shard of something else. A platform consciousness, unaware of so much more. Rant over. Thank you for letting me get that out."
174388931,I agree that 50mg of Benadryl should do it unless you are immune like I am then you gotta get some of this Saphris it’s great.
176182308,"I made a switch of GP and asked to start over with a clean slate which worked very well. Meaning I didn’t transfer data from my previous GP, but I was honest in telling about my history and current issues. Ironically I had the opposite problem. Somehow my previous doctor did not encourage me to up my dose of zyprexa. I was on 2,5mg zyprexa for years. But because of drug dependency(I used to be on higher doses) I got insomnia and slept like 3 hours average for a real long time. Also I suspected my previous GP thought I was faking it. We didn’t communicate very well. So I made the switch and the first thing my new GP said was, “we got to up your dose to help you sleep”. So I was put on 10mg, and from that point thing got much better for me. Changed and saved my life I believe. Anyways, if you think you are stuck and have little to lose you could always have a new doc evaluate you with fresh eyes."
176182309,Aww thankyou :)!!
174388937,Don’t you think a marijuana high feels a bit like being psychotic?
176182310,"Well, you know what sailors say. “Erection in the morning, blue skies at night.”"
176182311,Walked my brothers dogs. Did pump. Washed my sacred neighs back and rain scald is better. Only place I ever felt was my home I left and best man I know n girls I adore and he doesn’t want me back. How can I live with that.i will ask him at a later time again.otherwise I will have to remain his fan and do best I can. I have lived at many places but only one place felt like home n that was with my x n his dogs.i learnt difference being in lust and passion and being inlove.
176182312,I think 2 nights is just perfect for a mini break. Plus a sleep in on the Monday morning sounds real good
176182313,Hoping you are able to start feeling better soon!
176182314,"Yeah, the food is the only good thing about a hospital. And even that is not good sometimes. I have said before about a couple of hospitals I’ve been in that they were so nice that if I wasn’t sick, they would have been great vacation spots. But the truth of matter is that you are sick when you go in and I haven’t been in a hospital yet that I didn’t suffer inside. My first psyche ward was kind of out in the country or at least the area wasn’t built up yet. I went jogging in the hills with a counselor, we all went to the park and played kickball. There was both a pool table and a ping-pong table, I used to sit out back in a chair overlooking a bunch of forest covered hills, we played volleyball etc. I even almost lost my virginity there. It sounds great, right? It wasn’t, I was miserable, psychotic and unhappy and walked and did all the things I listed in a psychotic haze. And that’s what hospitals are like. You said it yourself, “crazy places to go with fights.” You could find a 
better way to escape life. Go somewhere nice and rent a motel or hotel room for a week. Find some motel with a pool and a rec room and do nothing for a week! Go camping, that’s even better. I guess one thing about hospitals is you have very few responsibilities. But the problem is that if you spend a couple of years in them you will fall behind the outside world and once you get out you would probably find that you are out of practice about responsibilities in the real world. I mean I understand wanting to get away for awhile but hospitals are tough."
176182315,"I didn’t grow up with a culture, but learning other cultures is fun."
176182316,I used to think my apartment was in a different dimension.
176182317,"sounds cool, tattoos can have a huge meaning…!!"
174388935,"My dad is the same way. He was always pushing me to get a job when I was actively psychotic. (I finally got a 16 hour per week job I love). He bugs me about mowing grass every WEEK when it really only needs to be done once a month. No one in my family understands the depression and lack of motivation we have with schizophrenia. They think we just need to “makes ourselves do X” (like getting out of bed). It’s not that simple. It’s not laziness like most think. It’s literal brain damage. With my new medicine I feel more liking doing things. I doubt your mother hates you. She just doesn’t understand what having psychosis is like. As parents we want what is best for our children, we hate when they are not doing well. A phrase I hate is when my mother says “you just have to make yourself do it”. You could try to explain it. But she still may not get it. Explaining psychosis to a “normal” person is like explaining color to a person who has been blind all their life."

174388955,That’s an older drug with lots of side effects. I think you need regular bloodtests like clozapine. They both can lower white blood cells and immune function.
176182378,"Faith in moderation I’ve never had to be drug off swinging because I was adamant I had the answer and everything a conspiracy But at the same time I learned to prevent myself from going manic; believing that all is entirely good and that positive thinking is the answer to everything. Either extreme isn’t good. If all else we need faith only in ourselves - if this world a facade that is exploiting us then it is the caretakers’ shame and not our problem when the smoke finally clears. All we can do is hold tight to our side of things maintaining our own integrity so as not to lose face; especially to ourselves. About the voices I am pretty sure the vast majority of interactions are a head game your nervous system is forcing on you. I have some pretty angry and hateful thoughts that come to me (most people do) but they are not ‘owned’ by me. The thoughts are not being delivered by anything external however. Keeping careful monitor of how my mind synchronized with my environment those angry th
oughts usually trip when we are in discomfort…as a stress release. Hunger, fatigue, pain, etc For instance ever been for a long walk in the sun and want to get home and you notice that for most of the walk your playing back a song in your head? It’s a mental defense attempting to distract you from your current uncomfortable situation. When you find yourself ‘telepathically’ battling an external party it is us fighting with ourselves. Our own minds fight back so that no pressure can be kept on them; a safety mechanism of sorts. I believe that the mechanics of the brain are so fragile that ALOT of what is going on in our lives results from our maintenance systems - like nightmares triggered to wake us if we are shutting down in our sleep for instance. It’s just that some of us, after being frightened by genuine paranormal experience, became a lot more concerned with the every day garbage coming and going in our heads which most people don’t realize is there because they are auto-ignoring it."

176182396,"According to this paper people with schizophrenia have a diminished or disturbed sense of self (hood).

176182408,Sleep is essential to well being! Cut out all caffeine if you are having trouble sleeping as the first rule. Adjust to new cycle by going to bed at same time and getting up at the same time every day. Use your bed to sleep only. It conditions you.

174388965,"I switched from clozapine to paliperidone injection and it was pretty rough. I can’t remember the details. However, I did lose a good amount of weight soon after the switch so I think it was worth it. Clozapine didn’t do much to stop my symptoms anyway, for me, Latuda has been a lot better. Paliperidone felt like it killed my soul, it made my negs so much worse. Some days I didn’t have enough motivation to get out of bed Because paliperidone depot builds up in your body and breaks down so slowly, it took nearly a year before the bad side effects from it went away. Its good for a lot of people though, just make sure you try it orally before they inject your muscles with it. I didn’t get that option."

The only requirement is the intention to give alcohol up completely. I’m not sure I have that intention, I believe alcohol has its place, if only as a social medicine.

Hopefully the suicidal ideation goes away soon. The longest I have ever had it has been about a month but I wasn’t hospitalized at the time. You are doing the right thing. Get help.
176182443,that is a good point I suppose. ofcourse it does feel real. scientific experiments show that psychosis causes damage in the brain suggesting that it is an illness I choose to believe that it is not real. it is easier to believe this once you come out of the illness that is the thing. I just don’t want it to be real aswell so that is another reason I choose to believe that there aren’t spirits or real people talking to me in my head. I personally think it is maybe just my subconscious braking through into my conscious mind in all kinds of symbolic metaphorical ways etc.

If you don’t have any local crisis lines, I know that they have nation wide crisis lines. You might check it out in your phone book.

174388990,It’s been a very good medication for me. However I have ran into some problems. My prolactin is very high and has only come down slightly with abilify. Also as of late I’ve been getting a reaction to the injection where my arm goes red and swollen. We are either going to switch to one every 3 months and perhaps increase the abilify. Or I will be starting an abilify depot and coming off it. To be honest I want to switch. But I’m apprehensive about it.
174388982,"It says a decrease of premorbid IQ of one standard deviation was significantly associated with greater risk of TRS I believe that is in comparison to non treatment resistant SZ IQ, not average IQ of the general population - but I haven’t read the whole thing. In a subset of 8238 males with SCZ, we found that those with TRS had significantly lower premorbid-IQ compared to non-TRS cases. Small studies of cognitive functioning in TRS have demonstrated that those with TRS perform significantly worse on cognitive tasks, compared to non-TRS cases [5, 6]. Our finding of lower premorbid IQ in TRS compared to non-TRS cases could be important in efforts to design novel drug treatments improving cognition. I can’t imagine how knowing that would help design novel drug treatments, but obviously they know more about it than I do, fortunately."

ad in my tracks. I’m working a low paying job as a cashier and am reminded everyday of where I could have been or my potential to do more. The only thing I try to do is be grateful. I have a list of all the things I’m grateful for and review it 4 - 5 times a week. My list of goals and everything I read and re- read to keep me going. I’ve accepted and come to terms with a lot of things about this illness but it’s a terrible curse I’ve had to deal with. Then there are side effects of the medications which I know are damaging my young body. I know how you feel but I thought I’d share this with you so you don’t feel too bad. Hang in there because we are all in this together!!! I wish you all the best.

176182531,Symptoms or diagnosis? They’re different. I have always had symptoms since I was born; well since the age when you first can remember. They got worse until I was diagnosed at 21. I think everyone has some slight symptoms since they are born. That’s why SZ is a genetic disease.

But you came to this forum and posted your dick ????, so you got my heartfelt response. If you’re like “lol bro no I can do dick weight training” then you’re wasting my time, and really just moping on the forums and being a wimp. You’ve kind of spit in my face metaphorically by saying you have this issue, and then by saying “Lol no I have dick exercises I can TOTALLY do” Acting like you need comfort because you’re going to kill yourself if you can’t get yourself a solution and then saying “jeez no its not that bad I have dick exercises”… You’re kind of a douche for making me feel like working this hard to try to help you when you brush that help off this way."

176182536,Hi new to the forum I have been reading it for a little while. Have been hearing things quite a lot and they have me on medication for that finding my motivation is not what it used to be. Recently switched from risperidone 3mg to invega 6mg and saw a little improvement although I’m having a slow day today. Any tips for setting some goals and accomplishing them? I think I want to try the _NAME_ tech online masters in computer science and I used be pumped up for stuff like that but now I just go for walks and drive around a bit.

I don’t want to do any of those things, but I force myself to do them. You can absolutely force yourself to be more productive. I have. Almost everybody here struggles with negatives, It’s no excuse.

174389004,"Up until 15 I was normal and very smart in everything in school. At 15 I started having cognitive symptoms and started to loose my emotions, became apathetic. Then my grades started being worse starting with language courses. At 16 onward I started having inappropriate emotions like inappropriate laughter. At 17 I started to self isolate and not talk to friends. At 18 I started hearing voices insulting me and a baby cry. I started to drink heavily and vomiting at home. At 19 I tried weed and became aggressive destroying mirrors, doors and walls the next day. At 20 all my university grades went down to 50ish and saw many Drs telling them I am hearing voices and that I don’t feel real or normal. They all said its stress. They refused to refer me to see a psychiatrist (A general Dr referral is required to see a psychiatrist here). At 21 I stopped university and voices got violent telling me to kill myself bcz I am Jesus and won’t die. They said prove us you’re Jesus so I swallowed a whole Tyleno
l bottle and ended up nearly dying Drs said in the emergency from liver failure. I was diagnosed with psychosis the same day. I started Abilify which made me a junky, an addict, hypersexual and bad. It changed my personality for the bad and made me have bad friends. These bad friends were into drugs, cocaine, weed, extasy and into prostitutes. They badly influenced me so I was smoking weed and paying prostitutes every week. I emptied all the money I had made since I worked at 14 y.o. Then my parents paid my Visa debts (I retreated cash from my visa) and closed my Visa."

My GP just didn’t know what else to do because it helped a little, literally, a little, but it’s the only AP that I didn’t have a reaction to. So she just said as long as I still had young kids that she recommended I stay on 40mg. Well, I got off it in March, lost almost 75 pounds since then without changing diet or exercising, but other health issues have occurred. I just have to say, if it works, but you need an increase, do it slow. My 15 year old is backing down from 4 years on 20mg, he’s down to 15mg and no no longer takes his ritalin for Adhd, he’s adjusting, but it’s been for the best."

176182611,"_AT_MENTION_ - I saw your other post, but it got closed. I can tell you are still struggling with things that seem very painful for you. Given a lot of your theological/metaphysical leanings are similar in some regards to my own, do you mind if I share some of the ideas that helped pull me out of a very negative place experiencing a hellish sense of reality very similar to what you’ve been describing? If you’d rather not, I understand and would not be in the least offended if you stop reading and ignore this. Let’s say we, in a number of years, create a computer-based intelligence. Not artificial, but a real self-aware and self-determining intelligence. Some sort of quantum computer super-being. Within that being’s manifestation of reality (as data it could control completely), would not anything it could think up become possible? Similar to _PERSON_’s concept of how we can imagine a perfect isosceles triangle but not create a perfect one in reality. How would such a being create ideas th
at it itself could not think of? Could it reproduce itself under conditions random and balanced in such a way that those copies of itself would be different enough to be seen as “other”? But how would those new consciousnesses not simply dissolve in all different directions, having reality unravel before they could control it? Maybe it would be prudent to start them off in a shared reality that the first being was able to control, but letting the subjective experience of that reality be up to those child processes spawned from itself? Maybe even a shared reality loosely based on the reality in which it was itself created? There’s not much “new” here in this idea, it’s basically a mix of Eastern philosophy and simulation theory. But as a concept, I found it particularly interesting because it would suggest that while we can’t change our genetics, other people, or the physical world in which we find ourselves, we can control to some extent how we experience that objective reality (and such a thing 
might even be the whole point). And indeed, while I had been thinking of a version of a reality where things were very dark and dystopian, I realized that if in fact we were relatively young (relative to eternity) digital beings, eventually we’d be able to manifest any possible reality for ourselves we’d choose. This may just be a starter universe where we can somewhat safely and gradually learn to control our consciousness without tearing apart the fabric of our very being (even if sometimes going down the rabbit hole of subjective thought can feel that way). Is this “the truth”? No idea. But I have no evidence that it is any more or less the truth than any other explanation for our existence. And I did find that the idea allowed me to start to “choose” my experience of reality. I decided that a universe where I was plagued by horrible experiences from the past, or experiences as you said of hours lasting for entire lifespans between blinks, the very fabric of reality being torn apart around me, 
etc - that all of that simply wasn’t ethical. It’s not the reality I’d choose to impart upon others, and so I denied it being imparted upon myself. It worked. I don’t know that it will necessarily be helpful to you, but having created this mental framework was extremely successful in eventually breaking my paranoid feedback loop, and when I started to sense that feeling of doom and gloom and thoughts of a sinister version of reality, I would simply bring to mind the knowledge of the superposition, of the greater concept of nonduality, and then actively choose a version of reality consistent with what I was observing which was in line with what I wanted it to be, rather than what I feared it was. I acknowledged that the version of reality I feared was not only possible, but could very well be made to exist (and somewhere in the infinite possibly even did), but at the same time recognized that it was simply one “solution” for the reality I observed, and granted myself the ability to choose a differe
nt solution for myself. I didn’t think I could simply “choose” those negative ideas away (and they were really bad and really convincing). But it totally 100% worked. It’s been about a month now, and if anything I’m a little bit more at peace and happy with things in my life (as opposed to freaking out about everything). In terms of your point about determinism, if God is infinite (I think this is likely), and our universe if finite, then our universe is “solved” to God. So God may not be playing dice, and no matter what we choose to do the outcome will be as God desires, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have free will to choose our moves (even if God will win every time). Much like playing chess against Google’s AI. Again, in the spirit of non-duality, a universe both deterministic and non-deterministic (it would also explain why our universe would be finite with an eventual heat death even if God is in an infinite plane - if our universe was infinite then it couldn’t be a “solved” sy
stem and would potentially be an infinite stalemate). If any of these ideas are interesting to you, take whatever you’d like. I don’t present them such that you adopt them as they are - in fact I believe the whole point would be to choose the reality you’d like for yourself, which is undoubtedly not what I would choose for myself. But it may give you a foothold to help pull yourself out of the place you currently find yourself, which it seems is very unpleasant. Good luck, and if you want to discuss any of these concepts further, I’ll be around here periodically and happy to do so. I’ve been finding your posts very interesting, and close to my own attitudes on some topics."

I tried research and it was complicated. the professor gave me a gimme grade, I couldn’t be in the lab by myself, I wouldn’t know the first thing on what steps to take.

I’d incorporate exercise, which might help with the flat feelings."

Now, granted , my mother had a sharp tongue and said many cruel words and Dad projected a lot of self abasement. The car horn stuck on when I was in a car accident and mother used to fall making harsh sounds scary. But I had chosen music to study so why did I miss auditory. I guess I’m a rebel."

I suggest each country having an army of only 100. They are trained beginning at the age of 6 to be Warriors and Fighters. If there is a disagreement, they meet on a neutral Island and no one wins until every man is gone except one left standing. There are cameras to catch every minute detail of the action, including wide shots close-ups aerial views etc etc etc. This would satisfy most people’s desire for Bloodsport, while limiting the harm done to only 199 live, rather than millions, and years wasted killing both soldiers and the innocent Just a Dream? Maybe. But we are all going to have to decide something soon."

I don’t like this change. I feel I have lost contact with people who support me through though times, but also better times when I need support.

176182765,i cant remember why exactly but low GI foods are really great. i reckon it is to do with the fact that they are associated with good amounts of fibre and not so processed in general. they allow for a healthy flow of insulin(blood sugar hormone) levels in the blood instead of exhausting the job of the pancreas with massive insulin production. according to the scientific journals

I know I should be happy with alot of things in my life but I’m depressed and want off of this ride, I don’t feel any zest for life anymore. I also feel like everything is going to be downhill for me except for times I spend with my kids, and time is going by both fast and slow. I look back at stuff that happened over 8 years ago and it feels like yesterday but then I simultaneously feel like I am stuck in an eternity. Nobody really says how really being depressed lasts as long as it can. I keep looking up ways to get out of this mindset but I can’t hold an interest in things. I keep reiterating the same stuff and am stuck just wishing I didn’t exist. I know the meds are causing some of this but I’m still gonna take them. I think I might be lonely too but I don’t feel like interaction can take this feeling away from me,

174389058,"Thank you for posting this question and initiating conversation. This is important. I spoke to my therapist yesterday and I brought up three topics of discussion: Causation vs. Correlation - What is the difference? Psychosis vs. Schizophrenia Feelings of regret and guilt around Cannabis She explained to me that is not 100% certain in the medical field and in scholarly research what causes schizophrenia. There are studies that strongly suggest that “sz” has a genetic component. Others have also theorized that some form of childhood trauma puts more people at risk, but again it does not cause it. In my case, I can say with absolutely certainty that cannabis (marijuana) played a HUGE role in my development of sz. Before I used cannabis I was fine, and after and ever since using I have not been well. I started to have symptoms between 20 and 21 years of age. What’s scary is that my good friend at the time also developed symptoms. Same age. Same gender. He also used cannabis. Since using cannabis, 
my friend has not recovered. According to the DSM, he developed “negative symptoms,” where I experienced “positive symptoms.” For 10 years, on-and-off, I experienced auditory hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, anxiety and depression. All of this started post-marijuana. I can’t say with 100% certainty that I would have experienced all those symptoms had I never used drugs. It seems like many of you have experienced the same thing either with marijuana, LSD, alcohol and/or other substances. I am curious to hear from those who have or been diagnosed with “sz,” who have never used drugs before…How did you develop sz? What “brought it out?” How old were you? What activities were you involved in? How did you know that you had “sz?” I ask these serious of questions only to better understand “sz” in people who have no experience with drugs, because I am frequently told, especially by marijuana advocates, that “weed didn’t give you ‘sz,’ it brought it out.” I am working through 
some feelings of guilt and I would like to overcome. Thanks."

176182789,My sleep patterns are all over the place. Yesterday I slept from 2:30 pm to 10:30 pm. I do my laundry usually between 1:00 am to 5:00 am. It frees up access to the washing machine during regular hours.

Since I have gotten sick I also have an Associate of Science degree in Aviation Maintenance Technology in 2017. I worked as an aircraft mechanic for a little while after I got the degree. That didn’t pay very well. I currently work for the government and my masters degree got me a higher paygrade when I started working.

I’d suggest that you try to avoid doing that yourself because as long as you don’t talk about what the voices say people won’t know (or at least won’t admit to knowing in reality.) But if you go the “I need help” route you may eventually have to say something about it just for credibility. It’s a vicious thing. In the past I’d say go on the meds. But I’ll just say consider the meds if your day to day functioning is messed up by the psychosis. If you can actually live with the voices you can save a lot of money and bother. But if you can’t getting help can be the difference between a ,place to live and the jail, street corner, or grave."
176182857,Tbh that is what I want to know too. Im not sure that I have heard voices but what I do know is that. my paranoia spiraled out of control when I thought one of my neighbors were spying on me and drilling my walls to listen in but then again I’m not sure if I had heard voices or not so who knows

I’m pretty sure the underlying system of energy and unerlying relations of how it interact with particles is already known, otherwise it would be impossible to work on string theorisations. I would like the scientist to be able to predict a correlation between remnant fluctuations of cosmic backround radiation from dark ages which would also enable us to realize out inflation, even t=0, let alone manipulating universe without even observing anything at figures impossible to reach in a newtonian approach."

176182868,"Chitlette Stalking, Southernly 11/09/2020 So I woke up outside of a bar on revolution blvd. We had parked the car and walked across as a GROUP for dime, into Baja California, for priced well drinks, and to party and dance. My friend and I, his beloved and some delicate flower, that makes four. I so close to the gum on the side walk, I thought I had teeth and could stand up. Eyes the veil lifting, from obliteration, all I could drink. Exactly in between Los Angeles and San _NAME_, Hugging Mother Maine Corp. Not exactly watching brown bodies explode, wedding parties droned, but experiencing all the benefits of being ??????? drunk. The thought that rose against limey enhanced, Caronas at that table, the jokes, the dancing, the donkey show that the reality show hostiling, lusted for. I stumbled, revolution blvd. PRI shot guns off into the sky, at their rally, El Norte. Yet the authorities did not scramble, The People held, I set about to collect my comrades. I always wondered, where the exhausted shot 
lead, felled. I have no rational explaination, about I found my friend, his lover, and some delicate flower. We Four. Once collected, my companions unto the journey, I took the keys from my friend for a short while. Meaning to drive them all back to the place, in his car toward Norte, exactly inbetween Los Angeles and San _NAME_. Where we all had been before. At the boarder, at the wall serparting states, of consciousnesses, Chitlette gum was offered as a final, a sale protest against, imposed poverty, indentured waged slavery. When we arrived home, my car was parked at the curb, I was tempted to get in it and drive myself home. As much as I was under the influence, I decided not to. I opted to walk all the back to my parents home. _PERSON_, in the Dark. Or take a plane, and carry on, all I can’t leave behind. There are experiences, that cannot be exactly translated: a long walk, with street lights periodically sodium lightning you, bully shadows name calling and throwing rocks. Sins revealed, nudity withou
t shame. The trance induced in walking home. Blocks In A Central Park, Sort of Homecoming. Walking through neighborhoods in which, I will never have property. The Orange _PERSON_, The Shadows, staring back from out there, from the end of the pier. Leaning into the effort, like Corporations and Cartels have personhood too. Walking when every one is comfortable in their beds, In communities where gum is greatly discouraged, from side walks. The Rumble of No Mufflers, The song of Solitary, The Chorus, both praise and damning, Warm and Cool with the touch, Tag teaming. Blowing with trumpets, Greater Our Distance. The Dissonace of The Night and Day. _PERSON_ taking the helm, rowing the boat, gently down stream gentile glee, a skeleton half masked rising for a time, In a _NAME_’s web of conscious, pardigm porcine crimes. The miles, with four limbs, _PERSON_ to the feed lots, pan handling, please mind his many wives. The desire to lie in the weeds and let dew, gather as sleep. No, I know it is only a distance … 
So far away, So close. The question remains: What happened while I was unconscious prior to waking up on, Revolution blvd. Tijuana? What happened when I was conscious? Did the Mission Bell Ring? Was it true? Why do swallows come back from, where they came? In either extreme allowed, and to inquire still, is there an in-between? What labored breathing, finds teeth, lying among the the Chitlette? Stuck to the side walk, Pinata Liminally, On Revolution Blvd.?"
176182869,"Damn it guys, I only lasted three days. I wasn’t even horny but I watched porn and jacked off. Ffs. Ngl I am slightly delusional as well because I think something will happen to me if I go a month without masturbating. I already believe I’m God, so I guess I thought maybe my voice would get deeper or something if I abstained."
174389088,"_PERSON_ Thanks for your reply. I think that I figured out today during a brief meditation that laziness is part of my ego, which I seem to be employing as a safety net to make sure that I don’t kill myself or act out… Which would be influenced almost entirely by the voices. It is my dream to be in a spiritual state (ego less) like I once was before schizophrenia and to do this I think I will have to take the other advice I have been given and take my meds, so that I can be free of the taunting voices. I just hope I will be able to experience the depth of an ego less state while I’m on medication. If they are too strong I hope to try L- theanine. Anyway I hope that you find a way to break your relapse cycles, it sounds like you are doing pretty well though. best of luck with sarcosine And thanks for the kind words."

I’ve never been suicidal, it’s just a hopelessness for the future and regrets from the past. I will keep soldiering on and not take anymore meds."
176182891,Ok. My folks are high school sweethearts. My stuff is of the nature that they team up on my sometimes to stay on an even keel and help their own bond. Three is a crowd - at the very least.

Just because you take meds and look after yourself does not mean that you are by any sense ok, and for a lot of people meds do not even work. I am not sure how you think having negative symptoms makes you a lazy person, the outcome is similar but it is not because of lack of trying. _AT_MENTION_ does pretty well with his illness and who are you to judge him on that."

176182952,Not leave my marriage. Regret that a lot. Such is life.
174389117,Your on a schizophrenic forum where we’ve all seen what happens to those who go off meds. Yes. Your experience is relevant and so important to you and that is cool. You just piss people off because many try and help you but you don’t have the respect to listen to what they are saying. You keep your thinking in your world and don’t take any advice. Your no different from me. I had symptoms in the first years of grade school and wasn’t dxed till I was 29. Your young. You have so much ahead of you. I’ve been doing this for so long now and it’s not a burden it just is… Be respectful to the community. All’s I’m saying and be kind to those who are being kind to you.

174389122,"Bah, its not a big deal, if I was really miffed I’d have my mom drive me up and give them a visit. Its just probably a mix of miscommunication, the timing of the communication between me the point of contact, and the desired recipient. I’m miffed because I’m having trouble getting in contact and I know most of the problems is timing and I’m just stuck in my sleep schedule and such. its making me feel incompetent This is normal stuff for them and I’m just being pissy because I feel vulnerable feeling what are typical normal low level symptoms for schizophrenia for the first time. They’d probably think I’m being a wimp for being as stressed out about it as I am. I’m concerned though none the less, and this is a communication flaw that needs ironing out, it shouldn’t take the better part of a week to NOT get a phone call after three solid attempts."
176182957,"So wait, you now have the corona? I think last time I read your posts it was family members who had it. How many days have you had it? And are you symptomatic? It’s great you don’t smoke, I recall that part. As for your question, it’s funny, but to poke a hole in it, physical illnesses almost always show up (erm) physically. Right? Neurotypicals seem ok in this department."
176182958,They are all different because we are all different and you just have to try some. A good shrink will get an idea if it’s working or not. A good relationship with your shrink will help you out so much better… For me. Zyprexa and Effexor. It cools me out just right.
176182959,"Last class I did. I said I wanted to be some profession that I can’t even remember anymore. Pretty much I was psychotic and manic and said I wanted to be some grandiose profession when I “grow up”. Well I gave up on that idea quickly but the teacher wouldn’t give up on it and gave me a hard time every time I got a question wrong or something. Until I stopped going. So yeah, I’m definitely not gonna claim some illustrious future career for me if we have to share that about ourselves again."

You’re already smart if you know how to use technology like this forum, a computer, a cellphone, or even watching tv, radio, reading, etc I would say the intelligence is still there mostly but if you have negative symptoms like me, you lack the drive and energy to fully use that intelligence. I blame both, the meds and the sz."

176182971,"People don’t believe their intrusive thoughts. For example, I used to have intrusive thoughts about my loved ones dying. I did not believe it meant my loved ones were going to actually die. I just wanted to be rid of the mental images of their deaths."

My pdoc does prescribe 30mg of dexedrine (previously 60mg of vyvanse), so he acknowledges that it does help me, however he is steadfast in the common viewpoint that anything above 45~mg will induce psychosis and increase anxiety… Idk…I can admit that it’s a problem. I guess in a way I’m partly asking if the answer lies in going to a long (1-3 month) addiction program, then once finished the program, will I be able to function normally without amphetamine? Because I’m not attached to amps, I hate them, would love to function without, but I just end up staring at a wall. Been like this for 13 months now. Ever since I woke up alive after my 60mg klonopin + 200mg codeine OD attempt- it’s all been different. Maybe I died and am in hell, idk…really have no clue at all. :l"

174389126,"Most accounts I read/hear about people with schizophrenia or other psychosis-related conditions describe the person as having been a “normal, ordinary person” up until the onset of their illness. My own experience is of having been a “strange child” from the earliest days that I recall and of having what I now understand to be auditory hallucinations on an occasional basis from around 4 or 5 years old onwards, usually along the lines of hearing my name being called or hearing someone say something to me when there was no-one around. At around 6 I remember seeing the figures on a poster on my bedroom wall walking off the poster and marching along the wall towards me, holding weapons and with malicious intent. I also, from my earliest memories onwards, had extremely vivid and strange dreams every night, usually nightmares, and of such a bizarre disturbing nature that I still vividly remember many of them to this day (I’m now in my mid thirties). I initially assumed all this to be normal but 
when mentioning it to other children at school I soon discovered, to my surprise, that I was apparently the only one having such experiences and by naively sharing such things I soon gained the reputation of a “weird” person, which led to a lot of social isolation and ostracism, which merely compounded such things and gave rise from when I was around 9 years old to various obsessive-compulsive behaviours and occasional self-harm plus a thankfully failed and poorly thought out suicide attempt when I was 10. I’ve always had a very strong and active imagination and always been prone to (and often enjoyed) imagining strange and surreal things. I suspect this, and some of the other things I’ve just spoken about, may be true for quite a few people who go on to become schizophrenic or psychotic, as I’ve seen it described by some as not only “an illness of perception” but also “an illness of imagination.” So without going on any further about myself, I’d be interested to hear if anyone else on her
e had incidents and signs in childhood that could have foreshadowed to some extent the “condition” they were diagnosed with later in life? It could be that you also had occasional hallucinations and ultra-vivid imagination and nightly bizarre disturbing dreams or something else…or you may have truly never had anything like that until adulthood, which is perfectly fine too!"

176183004,It sounds bad to be attacked by voices for expressing your opinion. I empathize with you certainly. Maybe u needa be more confident though. Just something to think to work on. I used to lack confidence and hallucinations would attack me before I say something it was very conflicting. Now I have more confidence my confidence kindve over rides the hallucinations even if they’re still kinda there. My certainty that I do matter is more great than the hallucinations telling me to be a different way. But I gotta say it’s not easy when something is telling you to do something and it seems real like you should listen to it. In the end u gotta believe in yourself though. Hang in there saynow

176183050,"Dear brother, When the weather dies out and the sky becomes grey, You will find yourself under the shade When it is my time. There were multiple secrets that your parents were hiding. In my lifetime, I was told to abide in them; I was told to hide my symptoms from you, My heart, my soul, my scars, everything was kept from you. I was told that you were to be loved, So lovingly I carried my scar to the end And let her rest until I am tired. And now, the Heavens have allowed me to go. One day, when you form your own family And see me withered away on a hospital bed When my heart tells me to stop breathing, Or when my muscles have slept away, You will know those secrets. Now, don’t cry. Life is mortal. But when your children are born, You will realize that life is never-ending, And one dies, another is formed again. So you must abide yourself to goodness and to compassion, Love as you have ever loved; love your offspring. So on that fateful day I draw my last breath, You will know that my soul lives 
in you."

I was better off before I knew about it. It’s taboo to talk about so people will say it’s not real and you have to up your meds. They can hear people talk to me in public and there’s a few who have been very racist and anti-semitic then there’s this girl who says things with sexual conotations to people around me. I miss the days before I found this out. my world is gone and I’m very weary of going outside. They call it voice. I hate it. My mind is entirely public.

I think I would probably like to have a marker or tombstone somewhere to acknowledge that I was once among the living but I don’t necessarily have to be buried there. I guess even that would require land and would eventually be cleared and turned into a golf course or something.

My daughters are my heirs and I thought they were in danger…that i had to get them secure. A car in our building lot had a sign on the dash that read “Supreme Court of Canada”.

I wrote something about non-Catholic religions and presented ideas which potentially can be dangerous to Christian faith. I think that these informations are very important for knowing my problems and mental disorders, for understanding my difficulties. Despite many coincidences/delusions of reference/ideas of reference I had practically no hallucinations, especially longer ones. I had auditory hallucinations very rarely and their were really simple, they were single sounds or words which occurred usually before getting asleep. It happened maybe about 15 times in my life. I remember that when I was about 12 - 15 years old I heard strange music in the room in which I slept. I don’t think that it was hallucination, but I might wonder what was the source of that music. It would rather not be generated by mobile phone (in that time mobile phones in my home were probably not as advanced technologically to 
emit sound of such a high quality). What are origins of my most interesting coincidences associated with geometric or arithmetic sequences? 21, 42, 84 - it was rather first sequence which attracted my attention. It is associated with numbers after letter F and before dots (if dots are present) in ICD-10 codes of three mental disorders with which I was diagnosed 28.4.2015 first time in my life. They were: F21 - schizotypal disorder, F42.2 - mixed obsessive-compulsive disorder, F84.5 - Asperger’s syndrome. 3, 6, 9 - I heard about these three numbers (which form arithmetic sequence) 13.11.2015 about 5 - 6 p.m., at program emitted on 84th channel of satellite TV, it was about extraterrestrial beings (in which I do not believe) and _PERSON_ to whom saying “ If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe ” is attributed, first coincidence with these three numbers was associated with the fact that exactly five weeks later, 18 . 12 .20 15 , I watched or listened a
nother episode of the same program on the same TV channel, also between 5 and 6 p.m. and due to it I had quite large coincidences, date 18.12.2015 is interesting - it is in 21 th century, 15 th year of that century, 12 th month in that year and 18 th day of that month - numbers 21, 15, 12, 18 sorted ascendingly are four next terms of arithmetic sequence starting by numbers 3, 6, 9! 33, 42, 51 - they are atomic numbers of three chemical elements which Polish names I “considered” to be vulgar words for immodest parts of body when I was about 13 - 15 years old. These numbers forms arithmetic sequence which has three numbers, six digits and nine as common difference. I noticed coincidences associated with that sequence only about first half of 2018. 6, 13, 20 - days of the month in December 2014, on which men from my small locality dies. They have graves which are in one row one after another at the same cementery (and cementeries were important for my first coincidences in September 2014). They quite closely
