175943842,"Last night I took my first Seroquel 50 mg Extended Release pill.I could not function this morning because my brain was in a fog.Spent AM in bed or in lazy boy.It says on the bottle ,do not crush or cut in half but my next dose will be cut in half . I took the pill at 22:00 hres last night and It is now 13:32 hres( over 15 hres ) and i am just starting to come out of it . Half the pill will be around 25 mg that will hit me in one shot but I will have all night to get 25 mgs instead of 50 mgs .A lot of people cut the regular 50 mg pill in half so what s the big difference. ? Next month I will ask to have the regular 50 mg and I will cut them in half because 50 mgs is too stong for me.If need be ,I can always take the whole 50 mg later on.Anybody out here that has been through this ?"

You might be like me and did drugs which triggered it but from what I’ve gleaned over the years of reading up on schizophrenia and being on this site, it seems to be that we were born with the propensity to become schizophrenic and certain things trigger it. You could have lived a perfect life without one mistake and still you would have become schizophrenic. There’s no one to punish you. It’s a medical condition. God didn’t inflict it on you or the police or an old gypsy woman. There’s no one doling out schizophrenia as a punishment. Anyways, I do remember your screen name, but I don’t remember your story."

175943903,"Interesting, I've always seen the High Priestess/ Popess and The Hermit as the study of wisdom ^ and the High Priestess in closer relationship to the Magician than the _USER_ID_ / Pope. I saw the Magician as manifesting with intention and I can see how it would take knowledge of precise laws to do so, but I envision that it's not until the High Priestess before much wisdom is applied. Wonderful translation of the principle and the archetype! Good point. *Can you speak on the Justice card? *As well as why so many of the figures have one foot on land and one foot in the water? When I said ""no right or wrong"" I was thinking more of idealism. I dont know why I've never even distinguished between the two before. Do you think they could be a spectrum or two ends of a continuum? I'm thinking that I contradict myself because, if I'm honest, I enjoy both illusionists and magicians as long as they present in ways I like (non typical). Yes, I'm an idealist. Innocence is pure - even when doing harm. Every th
ing a snake or spider does in innocent and pure at heart and never ""morally wrong"" Even if a pet snake managed to eat its human it would still be innocent, pure at heart, and not ""morally wrong"" - it would be a different story if a magician or primate did it. Same with children - they're never ""bad"" from a moralistic perspective. The closest to ""bad"" as far as I'm concerned, is spoiled and over-privileged - rather than something like a conduct disorder I've heard the High Priestess described as (moral) pure, but I see her as holding access to both the ""Left Hand Path"" and the ""Right Hand Path"" and leaving the choice to the seekers. From that, I guess can see ""purity"" because she offers information either way and ""justice"" since there are consequences to our decisions. * Tangent: How come the Star spills water onto the ground that then flows into the pool of water? I'm confused about them being Wheel of Fortune? I'd only see politicians as the Emperor if they believed in the their causes and th
e lies they spew - and I don't think they do. I understand the connection between the Lovers and the Devil, but why does the _USER_ID_ have two people at his feet as well? I've never understood why they aren't two different genders either. Fair enough I thought they were both the _PERSON_ just different parts of the story. I've not seen the suicide squad movie either. I just here about the couple a lot and have seen some clips. I've started both, but I can't focus through movies very well I see them as the opposite of individualism. I see individualism as authenticity and here it describes isolated self-obsession or self-seeking I do have to add as I complain about the glamourization of cluster b's: I'd be hypocritical to say there aren't unique traits that could be capitalized off within cluster b personalities. These characters just don't embody those traits. Unfortunate, I never thought of it like that. Another a-b-c thing. I wonder how many people consciously walk with that motive? That wasn't the way I s
aw it. I wonder how many actually see it that way. I quite like vigilante style for the most part That makes sense Happiness isn't necessarily the end goal That makes sense Individuals as disconnected rather than part of a whole How boring. I vote some type of meaningful vigilante movement. By my definition of meaningful of course My greatest issue is with the all the females who idolize the girl and the dynamic of the relationship. Most men have the insight to know it's ###$ up and harmful to the girl but can be extremely beneficial to them. The guys who don't understand the dynamic often end up taken advantage of and upset, and then get labeled ""incels"" Women on the other hand, have this all so romanticized they actually think being dysfunctional and behaving like that girl does is a desirable thing (not even trying to be emotionally regulated; being a tease, self destructing, going back for abuse and pretending she likes it, being a bitch etc.) Then when they meet ""a guy like him"" that isn't desirable 
to them, they jump on the ""Me Too"" bandwagon, but likely continue to seek ""a guy like him"" that is desirable to them while filling up a backpack of ""me too""s Then extremist feminism ignores that their own team is who's working against them the most, and that they should address that rather than lashing out at men and promoting the rights for women to continue behave like that harlequin girl without consequences. It hurts and separates both genders in the long run This is an instance where I agree with your line of thinking saying humanism (in the form of feminsm) is about ""a special individual that rise above the rest, but with no responsibility."" I don't dislike the idea of ripping off masks and the ""sport kill [of] idols"" The possible change in targets may be worth the openess I don't see that yet in people very often, but they're the types I gravitate towards. I haven't believed in masks for the most part for a number of years now. When I think of humanism as you describe it, people wear clown ma
sks thoroughly convinced they're wearing warrior masks. As we talk, I'm starting to see why so many people dislike them though and believe they don't think for themselves. I always thought the opposite was true but now I wonder for the majority. I also never considered that people may know the incongruity of all this and be using it as an excuse to do as they please in an, as you call it, ""individualist"" way. I think if people were taught values and critical thinking - and intelligence was promoted, being authentic would definitely make the world better. We just need a different ""breed"" in charge. Again, I'm not a fan of violence, but if it's going to happen regardless (along with oppression), the targets just need to be changed. I don't hold value in the same things most people do. Talents and gifts are of value, people who've walked through the fires and survived and chosen life and continue to walk in that direction have great things to offer this world. I can fathom the concept of eugenism in things l
ike forced sterilizations being ""life affirming"" - or more so, that those who promote the concept believe themselves. _PERSON_, on the other hand, was a brilliant magician and an adept occultist; however, there's no way he truly believed himself when he said was promoting the swastika or eugenics as ""life affirming"" ^ He was canceling out competition, boosting the economy, acting on his broken psyche, trying to placate his insatiable fragile ego and God knows what else - but there's no way I'll believe he logically and rationally examined the targeted people's traits and what they were offering the world, and thought he was actually creating a ""master race"" by executing them. ^ He was blinded by injury and casting spells. When they locked up and sterilized individuals with intellectual disabilities in the name of eugenics, in Canada, there was rhyme to the reason of proposed ""life affirming"" ^ NOT to say I agree with it at all. I find it a terribly complex and symbolic matter that most will never have 
clarity on due to the polarization of the topic - with humanists making it worst, undeniably. I don't even want to try to delve into that. I'll have to look up ""Faust"" I idealized humanism as helping people help themselves rather than shedding ""principles to live an authentic life"" and, as a result, causing people around him to suffer. I see how ""give and take"" are needed, but to me, it's more of renouncing martyrdom rather than embracing the side of you that disregards others well being. I saw it as service to God and His, while maintaining ones own boundaries. I don't think authenticity has to be an antonym to that concept. Well, originally I was trying to make a joke, but ""winning"" has been subjective throughout the history of mankind. If befriending mistrust and questioning things is a result of humanism and individualism, then there is some good in it after all. Only those who have something to gain discourage others' from asking questions. Perhaps, that's one of the roots in itself. If people in 
power hadn't been so threatened and self-seeking while dressing up as for-the-good-of-all, and taught people how to question instead trying to snuff out questions completely, we'd be in a different position. ^ Probably wouldn't have maintained a payoff for them. Nice how they can still displace responsibility to the people who dare step out of line and ask questions though Most real artisans are not marketable because we place our value in things like being ""gangsta,"" status, gaining money without work or purpose so we can spend our lot in life escaping reality through drinking and using and chasing tail (female or male) yet always left unsatisfied, same with chasing purchases (again unsatisfied for more than a moment), that joker with his harlequin chick, plastic instead of gemstones, cookie-cutter factory products instead of hand carved with intention and purpose. Being able to ""market"" yourself or ""sell"" yourself in this day and age isn't necessarily something one should feel proud of ^ Or, at the ve
ry least, one should be aware that what is ""marketable"" in this day and age, is the modern day ""emperors new clothes."" ""Value is cheap"" and ""no better"" in those who set the bar for the ""market"" as much as it is worthless in faux humanists I never even considered that before I'm learning I don't mind a lot of the things I complain about - as long as they present themselves in a manner I like (which, again, is something I complain about in others). Although I can see possible repercussions, I'm all for his work and giving people a ""narrative explaining the masks and so on"" or being a ""killer of idols"" or his distraction or angles. I won't be convinced at this time otherwise. You seem detached. I wonder what happens to people of the same level of intelligence, but with a high level of emotional investment (rather than the detachment you have). That could be quite uncomfortable. You just described most primates in general They ask the least amount of questions; they have the least to contribute to t
he world - and that is what's ""marketable"" - and they thrive, or in the words of a vivacious and successful young starlet, ""Dat ass, dat ass, dat ass, dat ass Dat ass, dat ass, dat ass, dat ass She bad, she bad, she bad, she bad She bad, she bad, she bad, she bad Gucci bag, Gucci bag, Gucci bag, Fendi bag Prada bag, _NAME_ bag, Gucci bag, Gucci bag Birkin bag, she in the bag, she drip, she swag Never mad, she glad, _NAME_ bag, she in the bag "" I'm confused, do you have an example? That sounds about right, unfortunately. Mind you, if we're looking at drug addiction, all the efforts to clean supply, naloxone, opioid replacement therapy and possibly legalizing opioids isn't because social justice succeeded. It's because it decreases use of resources (hospital beds, doctors, organs, medications, paramedics..), decreases infectious disease outbreaks (HIV, hep, STDs, etc) and shuts people up ^^^ It has nothing to do with enabling people, nor does it have anything to do with helping people. It's just that most p
eople in general don't see that, so ""humanists"" feel like they're gaining ""social justice"" and the people who'd ask questions can point the finger at them. It has nothing to do with humanism. It probably has to do with a backfired covert attempt at killing off addicts via fentanyl; probably why they allow ongoing serial killings of sex trade workers too. Cost efficient ""distraction"" from inadequate amount treatment centers, detoxes, interventions and improvements regarding ""eduction and child rearing"" and all the other parts of a zipper problem. I'm still uncertain what the problem with that project in the USA that gives addicts money if they sterilize themselves is (and why it's not everywhere). ^ That's actually a real form of ""harm reduction"" as far as I'm concerned. I thanked my snake for not loving me I can't say I understand how to define philosophy. From an artisan? perspective, it's neat to learn about _PERSON_ belief on ""seat of the soul"" being the pineal gland - given there are other sec
ts of spirituality who also hold weight in the role of the pineal gland. The whole field of science is becoming delusional? As in turning into a type of rigid religion in itself? Very interesting, I'll have to learn more about pseudo-Dionysus Yeah, in the social sciences they use tragedy to sensitize you to their cause - sort of like movies like the green mile or the titanic, etc. From one ""ivory tower,"" I'm being tossed down requisite reading of a book composed of different vignettes of some of the most horrible experiences of child abuse possible to do a paper (basically showing I read it). There's nothing instructional or beneficial to my future dealings with others in the book. What's more ridiculous, the author is a neuropsychiatrist with some very fascinating ideas and ways of explaining things and how to apply them, but instead of reading a bunch of his academic works and doing a paper on that, we're reading sad little stories that serve no one. That's sensitization and emotional tourism. If you don'
t have your own sad little stories you'll love reading them. You get an opportunity to step into a nightmare; feel a feeling or two and maybe even a tear - and then return to safety. I had another ivory tower activist decide to spend the whole last semester focusing only on a single case study from a notorious area of drug use, poverty, etc. As a case study, it was useless in connection to the very few theories she barely even addressed anyways. It wasn't chosen because it had anything to offer by way of what we were being taught (which we wasted so much time on, we werent even taught 1/4 of the syllabus). The case study, however, would probably make a top notch Hollywood tear-jerker drama. There was almost no information given on what we were supposed to address, but it was a very, very, very sob, detailed story. Tragedy glamorized and romanticized; interesting and enjoyable if you have no real experience. Before I lived where I live now, I worked with people in that area. I'm more than familiar (""sensitize
d"") with that stuff. Then on top of that, someone I grew up with / little brother type, died the same way our subject in our case study did, in the same area, at the same time I had to start working on it which I'd already been experiencing counter transference in anyways. She's basking in opportunity to use tragedy to enlist / indoctrinate / ""sensitize"" her future activists - yet we learned absolutely nothing other than opinions of how attachment theory is ""mother blaming"" etc. AKA when you said: ""Education and child rearing becomes a private matter, so humanist thinking means not saying anything in the face of abuse, unless it is some sort, like physical abuse, but psychological and drug abuse are fine. People didn't want to be moralized and do what they thought best, and not only that, but children were supposed to be left to their own device as well, so ignored. The cause was supposed to be social/religious, the individual was good intrinsically."" But it must be an effective way of getting people t
o show compassion in areas they don't understand or even judge and look down upon. When things don't stop adding up, too much for me. I prefer my sanity. Disappointing though. Probably a good technique to apply when kids are young. Interesting that ""humanism"" and (complete make $#%^ up as you go) new age are both on the rise. How would polar bears survive that? Interesting little history lesson. On a tangent, Buddhists didn't have a very clear understanding of the necessity of emotional experiences in normative people or their needs. Spiritual bypass isn't healthy for the human spirit at all. Spirituality and service. Adding to life rather than being a parasite. There is no other position of worth on this planet for a primate; same for spiders and snakes; healers."

We had the Spanish flu that killed millions and now we have this new virus.

And I understand why in the language of men my pet obsessions might be labelled as delusions. I’ve come to understand that my rejection of the sz diagnosis is rooted not so much in lack of insight as in my ideological and intellectual prejudices, most of which, if not all, precede the illness’ onset. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, even _PERSON_, among others, continue to shape my anti-ppsychiatric sentiments. I have decided to give you guys a brief but much deserved break from my persistent existential obsessions. It’s plain that these obsessions -particulary solipsism- are not only too easily dismissed as unhealthy or even psychotic, but that they have come to be seen by “minimal self” theorists as the defining feature of sz-spectrum disorders. I don’t think that I’ll ever be able to acquiesce to this view. Do I/we exist? Are we human? If so, what does it e
ntail? Is there God? Are we conscious, and if not, what are the implications? Do we live in some kind of simulation? Obsessing over such matters might be seen by most as unhealthy, presumptious, pointless, pathological, even unholy. Respectfully, I beg to differ. Wish me luck."

175943972,"Yes. According to _NAME_, that is exactly what it is. _NAME_, The Principles of Psychology , Chapter IV, 'Habit' : http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/_NAME_/Principles/prin4.htm ============================== 'The first lesson would have to do with the all-important issue of inspiration. All writers know that on some golden mornings they are touched by the wand — are on intimate terms with poetry and cosmic truth. I have experienced those moments myself. Their lesson is simple: It's a total illusion. And the danger in the illusion is that you will wait for those moments. Such is the horror of having to face the typewriter that you will spend all your time waiting. I am persuaded that most writers, like most shoemakers, are about as good one day as the next (a point which _PERSON_ made), hangovers apart. The difference is the result of euphoria, alcohol, or imagination. The meaning is that one had better go to his or her typewriter every morning and stay there regardless of the seeming result. It will 
be much the same. ' . . . [[ Herein lies the deadly trap for schizoids, because it is not true for you : ]] 'The best place to write is by yourself, because writing becomes an escape from the terrible boredom of your own personality .' . . . 'The question of revision is closely allied with that of inspiration. There may be inspired writers for whom the first draft is just right. But anyone who is not certifiably a _NAME_ had better assume that the first draft is a very primitive thing. The reason is simple: Writing is difficult work. _NAME_, who managed Fortune in my time, used to say that anyone who said writing was easy was either a bad writer or an unregenerate liar. Thinking, as _PERSON_ avowed, is also a very tedious thing which men—or women—will do anything to avoid. So all first drafts are deeply flawed by the need to combine composition with thought. Each later draft is less demanding in this regard. Hence the writing can be better. There does come a time when revision is for the sake of change—
when one has become so bored with the words that anything that is different looks better. But even then it may be better.' _NAME_, Writing, Typing, and Economics"

175943977,I agree . Your (frog balance)tone to fire monkey seems rather nasty. We don’t need that here. Instead it’s nicer to be supportive and well mannered to one another. I really do not agree with your view on intelligence . Not that I am knowledgeable about intelligence but I believe in a spiritual wisdom to who and all we are. You did well firemonkey and I hope you were not upset by such posts. I have not seen much of you on the forum frog balanced and what I have seen has seemed fine but these posts seem attacking towards firemonkey?:monkey: and I don’t think that’s ok and I’m surprised the moderators haven’t seen it as a personal attack that was out of line. Anyway I’m not sure about my common sense. I sometimes don’t see solutions that are right there and sometimes I might see something complicated. I struggle with things and socialising etc I truly believe that their are geniuses or brilliant beings that can not function properly in society so I truly don’t agree with you frog bala
nce who seems to think if you can’t do simple things you are not intelligent? I think some of the brightest you may come across can be totally incapable of functioning in society and can sometimes not even do personal care and need help with everything yet they may be genius in another way. I see spiritual intelligence or I don’t see intelligence as society does .

Next you will need to get your blood drawn regularly ie once a week, then once every two weeks, then once a month, its a pain but it is so worth it, None of the other anti psychotic worked for me!

I set my shaver to 1.75 inches and cut all my hair that length, then I use a smaller clip 1/2 inch and trim the sides and back, turns out pretty good.

I think I respect and care about him for sure. It’s probably only going to be a few times total – of me working. But today I left at 9AM and came home at 6PM. I was only working a fraction of that – most of it was traffic and commuting, but I feel more upbeat and positive. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to school but maybe I can get a job in construction as a laborer some day. My sister was making 40 bucks an hour doing that + had benefits full time as a female construction laborer… It was a volunteering thing – helping out my step-dad. I felt like I was sweating and getting exercise and my head felt clear and I smoked less and wasn’t bor
ed and was drinking less monster drinks. I felt like I didn’t need them as my head was focused on work. I didn’t really take a break, but we worked like 4-5 hours tops today. That could be 40-50 bucks at least for me. Not rich, but hey, could buy me some smokes and give me more self esteem and confidence in life.

This is fiction (I think) but the portrayal is antiquated. Our medication works better than this character’s did. I take my meds, take care of myself, and my children.

Visit/call a friend with a dark sense of humour and joke about my difficulties. Hug someone and cry together. Write positive stuff in a journal or here in the 3 positives thread. Listen to music. Do physical work that needs to be done and distracts me. Sleep, sometimes it is better next day. Think of what causes it and solve that. Or if i cant, wait it out. Helps best with pms-hopelessness, it lasts a few days. Take meds. Make myself all comfortable, with blankets and warm drinks and soft music and food i like and a hot water bottle and my softest clothes. Call a helpline and complain."
175944166,"I've gotten fat compared to how I used to be after lowering the Vyvanse. My BMI used to be 19 and now it's like 24-25. I'm afraid that I'm gonna gain more weight. People are like ""You're fine"" until I actually gain a lot of weight. I mean, you're supposed to bucket the water out of the boat with a hole in it right away and not when it gets over half full right??? I'm 100% guaranteed to gain weight on antipsychotics. I've gained 1 BMI point every year since I was on them. Anyways, I want to learn guitar, piano and violin. Maybe a few other instruments.. but I swear to God.. the amount of stuff I do is insane. I'm multitasking 300 different things. I'm waaaaay better than I used to be after psychedelics. If it wasn't for my trips, I probably would still be suicidal, going onto online depression chats and still talking to and helping suicidal people.. not that that's a bad thing.. but it was all I really did.. and sleep.. I must have lost my genius by doing that because my mind has decayed from not 
exercising my mind... And I will exercise once it gets warmer.. and not to mention the water fasting, eating healthy.. I can't list all the things I'm doing and I can't do all of these things in one day. I ask _PERSON_ for advice on time management and my family really helps me too.. I want to have time to relax and play video games as well. It's just all so much and my sleep-wake situation is haunting me. I have 12 hours every day and I have to make use of it. That's 6 months awake a year which is quite a lot if I think about it.. The fact that I'm not working right now helps too. But I just get so exhausted mentally that it's more like 2-3 hours of productive time a day while freaking out. That's why I'm learning meditation, buddhism, spirituality, etc.."

It Made Me Feel Uncomfortable Because The Polaroid Was Held By Some Hand. So I Would Psychologically Push it Away. And it Would Quickly, Slowly Return. So I Ended up Doing Anything I Could Think of to Make it Disappear Forever. I Started to Spin Words to Block it. Hope . Love . Peace . Hope . Love . Peace . Hope . Love . Peace Almost Like a Slot Machine. And After Two to Three Days of Constant Spinning. Pushing Away The Image. The Words Got Locked into My Internal Vision. Which Began My New Search For Clean Words. Individuality . Creativity . Hope . Love . Peace . Strength . Patience . Courage . 8 Words. Kept Those Words by My Side. And After 
Some Time. And Some Tough Quick Two Years of Suffering. I Grabbed Two More Words. That I Held Onto During an Unexpected Turn of Events in My Frequency of Living.

175944168,"Hi there biblepoint, Let me begin by saying that I had several gall bladder attacks before I had mine taken out. I thought it was appendicitis, food poisioning, etc. So I know only too well the pain and anxiety incurred with in. I could not sleep until 3am every night for weeks afterwards , because I would have the attacks around 2 am. So I hear ya. ( and I didn't tell anyone but my husband). It's been 2 years now, ( I am 62 1/2), and the anxiety does decrease. The ways that I found to reduce it might sound silly- but they work-force yourself to laugh. Seriously. Laughter releases endorphens, which turns the anxiety down way low. Read some jokes, call a friend to tell you a funny story, or just force a laugh- as if you were an actor. The other thing that really worked for me was going for a walk. ( Now with a mask). It doesn't have to be along walk, but I found that even 5 minutes into it, I could feel my anxiety melt. Keep me posted on how you are doing! I'll be praying for you. Blessings."

174338661,"Kinda yes but also no?.. D-serine has more preclinical and clinical data than most other drugs in phase 2, because it’s been around so long. Apparently deuterating molecules has been a thing in medicine for awhile. Through history, the introduction of deuterium into drug molecules has come in and out of favor, time and again, with numerous dead ends having been encountered.1?3 Nevertheless, chemists maintained an interest in replacing C?H with C?D to extend the lifetime of active drugs in vivo, while improving their pharmacokinetics and toxicological properties.5 Basically, the goal has been to obtain better efficacy with a reduction in both clinical dosage and the number of adverse events . Currently, there is considerable clinical activity surrounding deuterated compounds as drugs, with the following known drugs or agents being D-modified: dextromethorphan (Phase 2/3; AVP-786), ruxolitinib (Phase 2; CTP543), ivacaftor (Phase 2; CTP-656), pioglitazone (Phase 1; DRX-065), linoleic acid (Phase 2; 
RT001), and apremilast (Phase 1; CT-730).3 It is evident from this assemblage of advancing drug candidates that the idea of deuterium substituted drugs is finally gaining a lot of traction https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00765 So while the deuteration usually slows the metabolism of the drug down, it doesn’t always work. Concert Pharma also had a deuterated drug failure for another indication. So they can’t just deuterate everything, and I guess we’ll just have to wait and see if it works with D-serine."

It is hard to say what else it could be but try to do like the doctor says and don't worry about it. If it were something pressing she would deal with it now instead of later. Try to relax and maybe watch tv to take your mind off of things. Just don't watch a bunch of news. Watch a comedy. I like them because you don't have to focus a lot. I often have a hard time staying focused on tv. Keep hanging in there and take it one day at a time. That is the best we can do right now. _PERSON_, _NAME_..."

175944283,"If you’re having a hard time waking up at a specific time try going to bed a little earlier or a little later. I believe I read something about us have 90 min sleep increments. So if you’re trying to get up in the middle of one of those increments it will feel awful. Play with a little earlier, if that’s not possible a little later, until you find the right timing. You should be waking up feeling refreshed and ready for your day. Note: you may only be a couple minutes away from the end of your increment so just try a few minutes at a time until you find the sweet spot. Good luck, I hope you have a fantastic day."

175944298,"I think posting here is a good first step. Since you haven't been able to talk to anyone, you can begin by writing your feelings here. No one will judge you and everyone here has issues they are struggling with, so we understand the battle. You can write about as little or as much as you want. I do understand how some things are so painful it's hard to bring them out in the open. But if you can begin to share the trauma of what happened, it won't stay locked inside of yourself. As to your questions, I'm not a therapist so I'm not qualified to give you the answers you need. But finding a good therapist is something you need to be able to get thru all of the terrible things that happened to you. One step at a time."

174338690,"I got sza right out of high school and it stopped me from going to varsity. And I never got a job either - my avolition was too bad. I just stayed at home. Later when I got better I wanted to be a nun. Worked on that for five years but failed. After I became Muslim I moved out of my parents house and stayed in an apartment with another lady. I was sponsored by the wealthy father in law of my friend who also gave me a casual job at his fabric store. It was hard to work because my motivation was so low and I had bad bouts of depression. I wanted to get married because I needed financial support. So six months since moving out of my parents house I got married and now been eight years married. My husband is fairly well off middle class, wealthier than my family. So I could live knowing I could afford medication and pdoc fees and books and clothes etc. On my own I’m poor. I have very little money of my own because I never had a job again. I once volunteered in my local library but again avolition sto
pped me from continuing. I doubt I can keep a job and I worry how will I survive if I got divorced. Hope that never happens because I’d be quite destitute. And I love my husband! So yes, I’m a poor income sza as well."

175944334,I usually drink a cup of tea or something and take a sleeping tablet and sleep if I am feeling psychotic.

Sometimes I write down a to do list even if really simple things such as I might write down have breakfast then I do that and tick that of my list I might write down get dressed and brush teeth I write down simple every day things that are not so easy to do when you are feeling unwell … Howzzz it going?

175944338,_AT_MENTION_ I don’t mean to worry you but I was curious about loxapine so I searched it here https://www._USER_ID_.org/Learn-More/Treatment/Mental-Health-Medications/loxapine-(Loxitane) under side effects says low blood pressure and faintness. Why would your pdoc give you 2 meds that lower blood pressure? That’s a dangerous combo! Just looking out for you!
175944339,I doubt it’s my meds I have been on all of them for a year no weight gain then got my IUD and it started right after that. Maybe my hormones are just not back to normal yet.

Unfortunately that could mean I’m going to keep gaining weight for some time…wish I’d never gotten that stupid iud…

175944358,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_. Yes I want to ask my pdoc when I see him (hopefully soon) to increase my lamotrigine. Actually I’m doing it already - I’ve been on 150mg and now on 175mg I’m ok, I did play with knife other night but just a prick and slight scratch. Had arguments with hubby this past day and wanted to cut but didn’t. Did throw my journal and pen across room though, scaring my husband (who wasn’t even in the same room). Maybe it’s hypomania as _AT_MENTION_ implies. But sz can cause aggressive behaviour sometimes too - I read about it, how hostility can come about. Mine wasn’t paranoia based though - it was just rage. So probably more a part of mixed episode. Been very irritable and depressed lately over last week or so."

175944363,"I have been plagued with both insomnia and panic attacks, lately. And the worst feeling is the thought ''when will this episode end?'' I have been going through this for months, and considering using drugs or alcohol to ease the torment building inside me. I've talked to my psychiatrist about all this, but nothing gets done about the problem. I've begun to develop a death wish. There is no cease to these feelings, and no matter what I do, nothing really helps. So, I'm reaching out to others with this problem, to discover what they do, or have done to get themselves through when they are in the thick of this helpless feeling."
175944364,I am going to change pdocs I think because he always wants to reduce meds so much. I know I need a certain level of meds. I hate going up and down and up and down. I wish we could just find a balance. I know what that balance should be. It's just ridiculous that he always wants to change things all the time. I wish I could just find a pdoc who keeps me stable on meds instead of making so many changes all the time. Thanks for asking though.

174338706,"I woke up early and drove to the city with my dad. I was reading _NAME_ - Way of Zen in the Jeep, watching a podcast on consciousness, physics and psychedelics and then I was studying N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine because I saw it on my dads energy drink shot that he was using to stay awake. That got me thinking about and studying amino acids on wikipedia and watching youtube videos on neurotransmitters. I was also talking with a friend about our bad trips through messenger while using GPS navigation. Then my dad and I went to red lobster. I'm at a hotel now and I can't seem to sleep. Maybe it's too early. My dad drinks alcohol and fell asleep right as he lied down. Maybe I should drink alcohol to sleep? But then I'd have mental problems.. I'm just gonna stay up until at least 2-3am if I can't sleep. Then I'll take half a zopiclone. I can't take alprazolam anymore. I just did it once yesterday for the high blood pressure that I got from the Vyvanse - But I'm taking it as prescribed now. I think 50mg is a goo
d dose because if it's any higher, it doesn't benefit me - Productivity has to come from within. I'm too scared to take quetiapine or mirtazapine in case it prolongs my QTc interval and I notice it while trying to sleep. Also because I'm not prescribed them anymore. I'm thinking of ditching the olanzepine for sleep for 4-5 days until it clears out of my system and taking zopiclone until then, then maybe I can take the quetiapine again for sleep because I think it might have been the fish oil pills (Which I stopped taking a week ago) that was giving me heart palpitations. I haven't had them since - It could also be because I was combining the quetiapine with the olanzepine. I want off all of these meds. I think the psychedelic use has cured my autism induced schizophrenia. But now I understand the paradox and don't feel like learning - Or it could be because of the antipsychotics that are giving me mental fatigue. I'm in the hotel lobby and the lights are so bright. It's almost inducing a psychedelic flashback

I have white matter hyper intensities that are nonspecific in my brain. They listed a whole bunch of possibilities including a very small tumor or some ???? ( I googled it). I’ve had 2 MRIs so far. Nothing. Just white hyper intensities or whatever. I think it’s most likely a microchip than a tumor. If I was rich, I’d get the pineal cyst removed first though. I hate that thing.

The authors report a longitudinal case study of a woman with a history of bipolar affective disorder in which L-dopa shortened the manic-depressive cycle length when administered in a double-blind trial. This finding suggests a dopaminergic mechanism specifically in changing the frequency of cycling between depression and mania.

175944516,"When in episode and I’ve lost insight, I don’t know they’re just hallucinations. I believe them to be real, and I believe what they say. When I retain insight, I realize they’re just hallucinations, they trick me for a second why they happen, but I can more easily brush them off. Doesn’t change that the things they say are hurtful"

175944518,"There were 5 axis. I think the DSM5 did away with them. NCBI Bookshelf DSM-IV to DSM-5 Changes: Overview The American Psychiatric Association (APA) published the DSM-5 in 2013.

174338731,"That was an interesting article. This sounds like an interesting book. Currently, it doesn’t look like it’s available in the U.S., at least not yet on Amazon (for pre-order since it’s being released in June). As mentioned in the article, the author also wrote a novel some years ago, “The Shock of the Fall: A Novel” (alternative title “Where the Moon Isn’t”), that got good reviews on Amazon."
175944519,"On the other hand,you get your body checked,but last thing you thought about to hit you,is what’s next.I don’t think it’s hypochondria."
175944520,I woke up this morning and asked myself will I be ok this morning. Then went to an appointment with my sister and heard people say that I was going to die today or in two weeks. This doesn’t actually make me feel better. I want people to say yes you are going to live for a long time why wouldn’t you. But these voices tell me otherwise.
174338734,"Not that I know of. I think we need to be more active as a community for demanding these drugs, and also for finding something something better than antipsychotics which can give us diabetes and movements disorders. Not sure how we become more vocal though."

175944522,I sympathize. Hope the warmth and surroundings of home keep you well.
175944523,I’m not ok at all
175944524,We did just get a flag on this thread.
174338736,"When I’m lying in my bed, the voice comments on fake memory recalls, fake imagination or inserted thoughts. This is going on pretty much all the time, with small pauses. About 100 times a day I get an inserted thought saying “You’ll be tortured after death (forever)”, and then the voice says “That’s a lie” and another voice says “That’s truth”. Since I’m a god according to the voice, I’m supposed to know which one is true. Sometimes they say “We’ve ruined your life” or “Everything’s ruined” (along with the inserted thoughts telling me about the dreams I had before schizophrenia, or/and mental images showing me everything I could have achieved without my schizophrenia) When I’m out grocery shopping they comment on the things or people I see. Can’t ignore them, as apparently I have no will."
175944525,i have been reading online many different articles on the subject of is supplemental security income considered welfare? i think i may have asked this before but the answer i remember from the last person… if it was on here or in person… was that TANF is what is considered welfare? so in the general consensus of if i were to tell someone i was on disability or ssi would they think i was a welfare person?
175944526,Did they diagnose you with bipolar or schzophrenia because that sounds very much like mania.
174338732,"I’m on 1.5mg of Vraylar, and it helps a good deal in conjunction with my main AP, Latuda 120mg. I still have occasional positive symptoms, but not as bad as before I was on Vraylar."
175944527,"I’m hoping I got MpD or something aka DID instead. Like two splits as far as I can tell. Everything feels split off before 2011. Even when I go back to my time loop I wake up or I feel like I wake up and start remembering in 2013. Reality was always funky and I could tell it was being messed with by aliens since I was a kid and even way back trillions of lifetimes ago. I’m one of the few alive that notice these things. If I had my consciousness and was reborn back to 1989 as 0 years old, I could change my life and all the little quantum events would add up and life would be either totally different or totally non-existent."
175944528,I went out today to top up my phone and grab some food. The grocery store (Metro) wasn’t too busy. I did notice some shelves being empty. Gym was closed also. My anxiety levels were pretty low.
175944529,"Ducks, they are so cute and also harmless."
175944530,Im kinda nervous to post more. Ive not made anything like this one before.
175944531,My voices used to praise me for smoking as I was recycling the souls of the dead and enabling them to escape into the universe. Kinda weird but I don’t believe it any more.

175944537,good to hear you see things more clearly _AT_MENTION_ i wonder a lot about why meds made things go away… usually i think it’s cause the meds block the brain from seeing all that stuff that happens around us. But i try to think that it’s really the illness.
175944538,If I don’t shape up I’ll die sooner than I should. It’s scary to be 58 (my age) and read in the news that people who are 45 or 50 years old are having strokes and heart attacks and dying from them. My grandfather died from a stroke when I was one years old. My dad had two heart attacks that almost killed him when he was just a little bit older than I am now. He later died from cancer when he was 72 and then my mom died from cancer when she was about 74. So it runs in the family. I don’t tell people I’m going to die except to myself if I don’t get on the ball and exercise.
175944539,Last time I had some tears was when I found out that I have sz 10 years ago.

175944544,"Listen to me sweetheart… we ARE delusional but there is a strange magic about our disorder when “kind” voices start in and inform us we are in danger. STOP. Right now STOP. Don’t do what I and every other with this ailment do. STOP Stop making excuses as to why they are right. Stop listening so intently. Stop allowing something that (I assume) you consider to be external into your vessel. You my dear have allowed the wrong ones in and NEED to block them out NOW before something bad happens. There is nothing wrong with allowing a comforting word but this is not a comfort to feel this way about you man. Ps IF (big FAT if) it were true that only 1,000 people out of the 7 billion in existence could feel the power and hear the words of the Gods then it is HIGHLY improbable that you are likely to find another like you anywhere nearby and therefore would be even less probable that the devil himself was placed so directly in your path even if he were to take a vessel. Lucifer’s vessel will be sur
rounded by wealth from his moment of birth until his death. He will not be denied any luxury that he desires. I’m going out on a limb and assuming that your boyfriend is a little neglected as a result of your belief. Give that man a big fat hug, thank him generously for remaining by your side and seek help. My meds don’t stop it completely but I have a good understanding of where you coming from and why you are so inclined to believe. According to my voices Lucifer is in a vessel in Los Angeles and his only interest is his humanly desires. Why is he here? Because the apocalypse of course. He came in advance to watch it happen. Is that true? Who knows. Lots of us are told we are Gods, Angels, prophets and demons or even aliens but words don’t make us so. We are human and we have minds of our own that allow us to question our reality which unfortunately involves the bombardment of the mumbles, slurs and screams of “entities” that wish to use our energy as their own. As always… be careful with whom y

174338735,"Negative symptoms can easily be mistaken for depression so you’re not off the hook yet. At any rate there is no such thing as schizophrenia personality disorder, I guess you meant schizotypal which less severe than schizophrenia. All the best."

175944569,"_AT_MENTION_ That must be such a relief to be back under 160! I hate when I cross another ten pound mark. So it wasn’t so much that you only weighed once a week that caused the gain, but eating out of the ordinary for you during the week and it catching up to you. It must be a help to get back to your normal eating patterns. We have to be so careful on APs! My husband eats things like muffins, Klondike bars, frozen chicken _NAME_, frozen beef lo mein, pizza…all things I would like to eat, but I’ve adjusted to him eating that stuff around me. He gets home from work later in the day and I’ve already eaten by the time he gets home, so we never eat the same meals. It’s all stuff we can either microwave quickly or make quickly, like a peanut butter sandwich. If he eats his “bad” food around me, I’ve already eaten and I’m full, so I don’t get tempted. There is a banana nut muffin sitting on top of the toaster oven, but I am not tempted to eat it. I know that Zyprexa is unforgiving and 
I don’t want to gain weight. Now, when he got _NAME_ streusal muffins last week, I made him take all of those bad boys to work! A girl can only be so strong! lol"

I have no depression despite lack of friends and even wife (but wifelessness can be mentally unpleasant). I had “delusions” that women do not defecate, flatulate, maybe I still have something like them, but since about two days they might vanish or at least are smaller. Now I get olanzapine and sulpiride in rather low doses, I have diagnosis of schizotypal disorder instead of schizophrenia (and also diagnosis of Asperger’s and OCD)."

She has come down hard on my colleague and fellow CN, she’s “performance managing” me, she harassing staff who do extra work unpaid who now want to be paid…and it goes on. It is very sad for me as i’ve spent 8 years now in aged care, and i enjoy it because of the wonderful residents we look after. I have no choice now but to get another job. This bully of a woman is too clean in her actions to be pursued with human resources or anything like that. There is no other choice. I hope everyone else is having a better time of it, especially so close to Christmas."

I’m blessed in a shitty way that I have discovered simulation theory back in 2011. Didnt prove it like Bostrom but convinced myself. I thought about simulation theory nonstop for 8 years. Figured I used to be a simulator in a past life. I quit or left and went back in because I was bored. Also some drama, trauma, and ???? is why I left. I think I don’t have schizophrenia outside the simulation. I want my job back. Only was a simulator a handful of times. I’m a good guy."

But this won't last long. VMAT2 is ""The God Gene"". _PERSON_ already said that my dopamine genes are screwed up anyways.

175944604,"I left my previous job because the boss was a bully. It is a sad reality that some work places become toxic. But I’ve moved onto a new job, which has been great. Love where I am now. I highly recommend a move if you can, you won’t know yourself."

My review was back in January. Your medical history will be proof you’re still disabled. If your paperwork has space on the back page for additional comments, mention all the side effects and struggles your disability presents to you on a day to day basis. I did that with my review. That was 5 or 6 months ago now. I’m still receiving full benefits. You got this!"
175944606,"Yeah, I generally work 8 AM to 4:30 PM. Sometimes I work 7 AM to 4:30 PM or 6:30 AM to 4:30 PM. It's a pretty good schedule really. When I worked retail my schedule was all over the place. Some days I might not get off work until 2 AM and other times I was going to work at 6 AM. I'll take this cushy accounting hours any day. One of my bosses today was saying that they think they will put me to salary after the new year. Not sure if that is good or bad."

174338760,Yes. Agree. Too many medicines.
175944616,I personally felt awful on risperdone and gained a ton of weight. I had an unbelievable appetite on it. I wouldn’t recommend it but everybody’s different.

175944618,I hope it gets better soon.
175944619,"I don’t know if voices alone qualify as psychosis. I thought you had to be out of touch with reality. I hear voices every day but I haven’t been what I consider psychotic in quite some time. Psychosis for me is when I get hit with a huge wave of disassociation and begin acting on unusual thoughts. I could be wrong though, I’ve heard psychosis defined different ways."
175944620,Really? I’ve never had akathisia . That would suck.

My burdens are not any more likely to take wings than yours. We all have our challenges. Yours are different but we all hurt. My solace is not gathered from a positive universe but a loving God. I pray a lot. Mostly in the cool, dark silence of night. I feel His love when I need it the most and often, deserve it the least. He has answered many prayers and he will until he has to let the law of science perform it’s function. I have a loving brother who is 2000 miles away. My three children are scattered in various states with their responsibilities. I have one compassionate daughter. The furthest away with a large family and RA but she truly loves me and shows it. I don’t burden her but I do enjoy her cheerful _PERSON_ fun personality. She is so loving that she makes you for my two narcisstic children -who learned from their father. I know my life won

175944628,"So sorry to know you’re suffering with this. But you always seem to find a way around your problems, and you’re not afraid to experiment to see what works and what doesn’t. I really like that about you. If it weren’t for you we would be clueless regarding amyloban. And it really helped (and I’m sure it will continue to help) quite a few people. I guess what I’m trying to say is well done and keep doing what you do!"

175944631,My mother told me to live with my brother and his wife but his wife will never accept that. I don’t even think that my brother will accept that.

175944636,"_NAME_ said... What if he died, and you regretted not spending more time with him because you were retaliating because he had not spent more time with you and your wife? Then you would regret not spending more time with him, it goes in a circle. ""If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving one be me."" What can't you be the more loving one? Or, ""Love is like a magic penny. Keep it and you won't have any. Lend it, spend it, give it away, and it will come back to you one day."" Maybe you'll gain by helping him. What does you wife want to do? If she wants to see her father, then maybe that's the important thing, also. ""Of each other, we should be kind While there is still time."""
175944637,"Depends greatly on the hospital. The one I usually got admitted to was very new and pretty good. Sibgle rooms with their own bathrooms, buffets 3x a day, you could have phones and computers, buy cigarettes and soda, and smoke all you wanted in the yard. If you were a suicide risk, you needed permission from the nurses to use a lighter, and couldn’t keep cords or chargers in your room."
175944638,okay thanks guys.
175944639,Maybe experiment without the mood stabiliser and see how it goes. But of course taper. Check with pdoc thou.
175944640,That’s the position I’m in. I listen to audiobooks to get around the fact I can’t read. I don’t watch movies really. If I do I can only watch about 30 minutes at a time and then take a break.
175944641,"Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining information or input into a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people (keyword here is large ), either paid or unpaid, typically via the internet. If you have Netflix, watch the series titled Diagnosis to get an idea of where I’m going with this. If you don’t have Netflix, google NYTimes and Diagnosis. My crowdsourcing idea is simply how to better help people diagnosed with sz. I know you hear the word help and you may think to yourself, ‘ great, more help.’ Let’s go beyond this. What if I were able to crowdsource my immediate concerns? Say I’m having thoughts of persecution on my current ap, what are my options. Right now I have my psych-d and the members on this forum. Not a bad tandem. But what if I could crowdsource my concern to other doctors. Or get more support from other people with sz. Getting brain scan images to start. I’m sure your psych-d hasn’t even seen it (mine sure as hell hasn’t!). Imagine Sky
ping a doctor half way around the world to get her input on your concern. Or getting a response from someone who’s simply been there. I’m going to noodle with the idea, in the meantime, I ask you to crowdsource my crowdsourcing idea. Cheers!"

175944644,"Hi _NAME_, Welcome to the forum! I am sorry for what you are going through. It sounds like a combination of things right now. I know how it is thinking worst case scenarios. I do that too. At the weirdest times I will think of worst possible things to happen. I been recognizing it more though. And I realize these things probably wont even happen, but it is disturbing at the time. Remember breathing exercises. They really do help. Like _PERSON_ Cat said, check out the resources at the top of the page. There is a wealth of information there. I hope things get better soon.

175944648,"Ok, thanks darling for the answer . Well, my ap is Zyprexa, definitely. I tried every possible ap for ten years, but only Zyprexa calms me to a point. I need it. Its more strong, yeap, but the only one, which works on me. I think I was worng on the meds before. I put ten years to accept this illness, before I was paranoid because of it. Still struggling on this, but I calmed on this too in a way, yeap I accepted than I am ill. I tried with lower dosages of Zyprexa and my symptoms become almost life threatening… Well, I felt the ‘‘normality’’ today again outside, so I guess I need to move up here too yeap I think, that the meds were so harsh on me before, cause ive lost all sociality, all acvtiviy, too much despair and much sedentary for almost fifteen years, _AT_MENTION_ . So its harder here. But now, i’ll try to fight yeap. Well, I try to move my brain with all kind of stuff - books, informations, movies when I cant go out. Seeing my mom in the day and talking a few to my friends on my 
phone. I try now some more activities outside too as going just for short walks, even without talking to anybody if too paranoid, or just going alone to the shops here in my neighborhood… Yeap, I try to reverse my activity. When I cant, I cant… In fact in the day, I almost don’t feel the side effects of the Zyprexa anymore. But after it take, in the evening, I feel it still, yes… I get tired and sedated or almost like doped (with the pupils dilated lol), but maybe one day i’ll start to take the ap right before sleep. Take care all!"

174338764,"TLDR: I’ve always shown schizophrenic tendencies but my parents just thought I was a bit strange, a bit shy and a bit traumatized. They definitely didn’t think SZ. I was strange and still am. I used to see things when I was a young kid 4-10, shadowy men and creatures in the dark. My dolls would move and I was afraid of everything for a long time. I thought wolves and demons were chasing me around my house and I would always find someplace to be hiding in case something bad happened. I was very smart and did well in school. When I was a little older 11-16 I started having very persistent weird beliefs and began having trouble with my grades. I thought the vampire people from the movie 28 days later were stalking my house. Then I thought bioengineered zombies would attack. Then I thought for sure, a tornado would rip my house to shreds or a solar flare would wipe us all out. I thought aliens were in my closet and watched me sleep. I thought the world was going to end and that I would build a spac
e ship that would orbit earth and then bring a pair of every species up so they could repopulate up there. I just had to figure out how to power the ship, I thought I could do it with buckeye ball nanotechnology. I still saw the shadowy figures, still had plans for hiding places always. I was still afraid of the dark and still not social except with a small group. When I was real young a family “friend” abused me so I was always afraid to talk to adults about almost everything. My parents included. Because my life was threatened anytime I so much as thought about talking to an adult about it, I didn’t tell my parents. This mindset leached into anything I thought. I thought that if I told them anything, I would die. So when I started spending hours studying nanotechnology, they just thought I was really into science. They brought me to a counselor once they found out about the abuse but I refused to talk there too. Long before this, I learned to stop telling them about what I saw because they would just 
tell me it wasn’t real or that it was some kind of guardian angel that wanted to help not hurt me. Or they would tell me to stop being stupid or that I watch too many scary movies. I knew that was bull so I just stopped talking about it. I didn’t tell them when I started hearing voices at 19 because by then I knew that meant something was terribly wrong. I didn’t want to admit that. Somewhere around 12, I stopped sleeping normally. I would stay awake until I heard my parents getting up for work then I would pretend to sleep. I would only sleep during the day when there was light. Which didn’t leave much rest time with school taking up most of that time. I did this until I was 20. This caused me to nearly fail out of high school. My parents became frustrated with me because they just thought I wasn’t applying myself and that I just wanted to be obstinate for the sake of it. Some days that was true but not every day. I wish they would have believed me sooner. My parents were very dismissive back then. 
My mom because she thought it would soothe me if she said my experiences weren’t real. Just imagination. My dad because he thought I was making excuses for my poor behavior. Today my parents understand my disorder and they support me. I talk to them about my symptoms. On rare occasion, I work up the courage to talk to them about how they wronged me in my childhood and adolescent years. Sometimes they say they don’t remember, sometimes they deny, sometimes they accept and apologize. Either way, they come so far in understanding me. I love them very much."

175944692,"Everyone has their individual responsibility you are not in charge of that. When I was psychotic my voices made me believe that if I was seperated from the world, put in hell, then there would be heaven on earth because I’m not there.

174338781,"No these are not symptoms because of low dose. I have been stable and working for a few years on 5mg. This kind of thing rarely happens. I suspect this is because I have taken a supplement that contains tryptophan at the same time as I took meds. I skipped this supplement yesterday and feel much better in regards to feeling paranoid. I started taking abilify today and read on the pamphlet inside that it reacts with tryptophan. I suspect it is the same with zyprexa. I just connected that dot. (I am tapering zyprexa starting yesterday.) The same kind of thing has happened before when I took valerian root. But it was hard to connect the dots at first. But maybe my definition of negative symptoms are incorrect? They may be positive symptoms, but they are caused by a drug interaction and not a relapse. If it was a relapse it would be a consistent feeling. I haven’t felt like that today though. Just a few spells of beeing nauseaus from starting abilify. Felt icky so had to lay down for a while. I read 
a few others say it is common to feel nauseaus in the beginning starting a new medication. I hope that is the case. Time will tell."

Everytime I pee I clean myself to make sure no pee gets in the underwear. Also when taking a sh!t I clean my smelly parts with hand soap, water and kleenex. I put deodorant on my armpits after cleaning them with handsoap, water and kleenex. When my head hair is oily I just wash it with water. No more bad smell for a week until my next shower."

Now that I’m on good meds those situations don’t happen all that often anymore so I only take it once in a blue moon. I used to have to take it literally every night before bed."

175944804,"So basically I've managed to convince myself that I'm not God and not hallucinating this whole thing including my brain. Or that some people know and are trying to manipulate me as well as the sociopaths in the sky with no empathy knowing that I know that love makes you crazy. Like ""love is madness"" or ""crazy love"". The people with empathy. In order to be atheist, I have to be apathetic and lack empathy in situations where people don't want you to be hurt because they are hurt. Psychedelics made me a pantheist but I go in between atheist, theist and pantheist. It's a real struggle to convince myself that I've not gone completely insane. One minute im ok, then something happens and then I'm not ok and have to convince myself the right philosophy. It takes time and who knows, could take forever. That's a possibility. Everything is. I can go meet someone famous and they might be real if the fabric of my universe is put together properly which makes me believe in no God. I'm just wondering.. I beli
eve that it is possible for the right person (Lets say a psychologist) to convince a psychotic person that they arent jesus or something with the right words and actions. Do you think that that's true? But theres levels of psychosis. What if a prisoner believed that they can bail themselves out of prison when they're sentenced to life and about to get the death sentence because they are the tooth fairy and stole a billion dollars from a certain bank? Idk.. its still the same thing as believing you're jesus.. which makes me scared. At a point, I thought to myself, ""I don't care if everything is a solipsistic bunch of hallucinations.. they're real to me"". And that's what I'd be saying if I were actually hallucinating. Someone would have to tell me that I was hallucinating which I could just believe to be staged hallucinations created by my real hallucinations. So the point of all of this is that the brain gets stressed and goes into some weird state based on cultural conditioning, what people did to you as a 
child, etc.. I call myself a genius for snapping myself out of it. It brings me comfort because a genius is both psychotic and sane at the same time. Or idk? Who knows anything really. It's all nonsense. I should take the seroquel again and maybe the injection will kick in or I'm just stressed because of what is happening in my life idk."

174338794,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Augmentation strategies for clozapine-resistant patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Current pharmaceutical design, Jan 2020 09 Clozapine has been used in treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia. However, only 40% of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia have response to clozapine. Many augmentation strategies have been proposed to treat those clozapine-resistant patients, but the results are inconclusive. In this review, we intended to review papers dealing with the augmentation strategies in the treatment of clozapine-resistant patients with schizophrenia.We reviewed randomized, double-blind, placebo- or sham-controlled trials (RCT) for clozapine-resistant patients with schizophrenia in Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and PubMed database from January 1990 to June 2019.Antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, brain stimulation, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and ot
her strategies, were used as an augmentation in clozapine-resistant patients with schizophrenia. Except for better evidence in memantine with 2 RCTs and cognitive behavior therapy in 2 studies to support its effectiveness, we found that all the other effective augmentations, including sulpiride, ziprasidone, duloxetine, mirtazapine, ECT, sodium benzoate, ginkgo biloba, and minocycline, had only one RCT with limited sample size.In this review, no definite effective augmentation strategy was found for clozapine-resistant patients. Some potential strategies with beneficial effects on psychopathology need further studies with a larger sample size to support their efficacy."

He was kneeling down and accidently fired a 3 inch nail into the front of his thigh. We heard him go “Ah I’ve got a nail in my leg” So the boss goes over to him, gives him a towel to bite down on, and pulls out his hammer to pull the nail out. The kid (he was early 20s) was looking away from it and the older german guy (his name was herb and he was 68 years old) told him loudly “Be a man, Look at it when I pull it out!” LOL later the kid comes up to me and was like ‘dont tell anyone but im in serious pain’ lol. I said ok. Then later he cuts some stuff with wrong saw and wrecks the blade so there just yelling at him and then he crys and quits lol. One other couple funny ones was , again a new guy he was about 23 years was hired. He fell off a step ladder onto his back. _PERSON_ the old guy sees it happen and imm

At this point I was actually in charge of the new guy and he didn’t like me telling him what to do. One time we had a massive stack of plywood to carry up to the second floor. So I told the new guy, “so your gonna go downstairs and pass me up all the plywood” He looks at me and says “So your gonna tell me to go down there and pass you up all the plywood” I said “Yeah thats whats your going to do” Hes like ""So im going down there to pass you up all the plywood?!

The next dose up was 20 mg so I tried that and it worked great for a couple days but then I started noticing I was getting random spells of paranoia, disrupted sleep, and bizarre racing disorganized thoughts.

I’d say not worrying is the best identity to have. Because you’re always gonna have flaws when you look at your self image. Important to just live one with the world. Don’t say I am this. I am that. So much. Because then you’re making distinctions that separate you from your true identity of that you are one with the universe.

I’m never going to be free from them. I’m sick of forced medication. I got fat on the meds. I’m sick of it."
175944858,Not because of the diagnosis but because I have almost zero recollection of what i said and did at the hospital… how is this possible? I only remember my brother visiting once and i have no idea what we talked about because apparently my mum and bro visited every day for two weeks…how can i not remember a thing? Because my partner says it could be a reaction to the antidepressants thats caused this… but I came off them in the hospital… and they had to wait two weeks before giving me antipsychotics.

I had to drop out of the organization because I couldn’t handle working."

But at the same time it’s just like what more could I say? I hallucinate and have delusions off meds but not so much now. I have social anxiety and low self esteem but I know how to work on those and I am slowly. The best reason I can use a therapist is for bouncing off relational issues, like with my girlfriend family or friend issues. Because im.pretty clueless with that."

174338805,"I’m looking for cases, where people have begun hallucinating on Abilify, so far over ten people have responded with clear cases, of Abilify causing visual hallucinations, and distortion of other senses ( sound, etc ) . . I also hallucinated, very strongly on Abilify, on the dosage 45 mg, in 2006. However, another patient had a 12 - hour hallucinogenic experience on 5 mg, so the dosage where it triggers these things, is very unpredictable . . A danish patient began hallucinating on Abilify, and was labelled psychotic for 4 years, and put on other drugs, when Abilify was stopped, she stopped hallucinating, and left psychiatry . . Now, it’s somewhat complicated, but it turns out Abilify affects the type of brain receptors, called serotonin 2A ( shortened, to 5HT-2A, 5HT is the short name for serotonin, also ) . . . LSD has an effect of 25 %, roughly, in that receptor, and at lower dosages Abilify is at about 20 %, as dosage increases, it goes to 40 %, and crosses the point, that LSD has . . LSD ca
uses massive psychotic experience, in particular visual hallucinations, but can also cause ego-dissolution, disinhibition, so on, and is particularly dangerous, for mental patients, bec. it can cause disinhibition towards even suicide, and even after stopping taking it, can cause psychotic flash-backs for up to 4 years after taking it . . Abilify - Intrinsic activity 021714×1194 157 KB The graph says aripiprazole, which is the chemical name, for Abilify . . The graph is a bit complicated, the important thing to note is, that at lower dosages, Abilify hovers right beneath the LSD-value ( marked with red box, at 20 % ) and goes up to 40 % ( the second red box, on the y up - axis ) . . This explains clearly, why many have hallucinated on Abilify, so far I have about 12 cases, that have experienced a full LSD - like trip, or hallucinogenic experience . . LSD is a very potent narcotic, that strongly changes a person’s perception of time, causes hallucinations, and even disinhibition, here’s a description, of 
what it can do . . Description of different dosages of LSD : Low dosage - Bright colors, surfaces start to move, warp or breathe slightly. Confused or reminiscent thoughts. You start to think more. Change of short term memory leads to continual distractive thought patterns. Your brain starts to speed up and you become more aware of everything. Medium dosage - This is where things can get powerful. Your mind is racing. Beautiful colors are everywhere. Closed eye visuals are very apparent at this point. Life changing, spiritual experiences or realization can happen at this dose. If you are a noob to lsd this dose is simply too high for you. Many people can handle it quite well but some may freak out. High dosage - Strong hallucinations and visuals. objects morphing into other objects (both closed and open eye visuals). Destruction or multiple splitting of the ego. (Things start talking to you, or you find that you are feeling contradictory things simultaneously) Some loss of reality. Time becomes meaningless. P
retty much where even some of the most experienced people draw the line. Your vision is almost completely enveloped by fractal patterns, and if you were to stare at some pavement or something, it looks like you can see to the end of eternity. Miles and miles of visual depth. There are many subtypes of these: Mandelbrots, spirals, wave interference patterns,etc. I have already got answers from people that have hallucinated, but everytime I ask, more people come forward, so I wanted to ask again, since new people read here, all the time . . Thanks <3 <3 . . . ."

175944887,I got a new job. Talked about this in the say anything thread yesterday but I am going to work part time as an aircraft mechanic. I already have a full time job working for the federal government and went off of SSDI in June. I had to ask permission to take a second job and they have 10 days to approve it or not. I will be on call outside of my normal working hours and on the weekends to go to the airport and work on planes. They are going to start me at $30 an hour. I worked as an aircraft mechanic for 6 months in 2017 and 2018 but they were only paying me $15 an hour. That’s why I got out of the business and took this federal job. This new job is only part time though. They said maybe I could do full time in the future if the company grows. The guy said after a month or so if I learn fast and can go out by myself I will get $38 an hour. For each service call I will get a minimum of 4 hours of pay. So even if I only work on a plane for 30 minutes I still get paid for four hours. Of course if I wo
rk more than that I get that too but I also get mileage if they send me out of town. The guy said the average call was about 25 minutes like if a plane won’t start or something. So long story short I will be working more than 40 hours a week. I don’t know how often they are going to call me yet. I am going to have to wait and see. I have to go and take a drug test tomorrow. Was supposed to do that today but I was too busy at my other job. This will be like a hobby I can get paid for but I don’t know if I will be able to handle extra work. I might have to quit or only do it on the weekends. My wife is already complaining she is alone all the time. She got used to me being home everyday. Will let you guys know how I manage with two jobs. I have to buy some smaller tool boxes so I can keep my tools in my truck. My tool box is too big to drive around with it always in there. I will also have to carry two sets of work clothes with me to go from job to job.

However, there are a few “schizophrenia, susceptibility to” entries on OMIM, which is a genetic disorder database. We’re not entirely sure of the mode of inheritance. It’s mendelian inheritance, but we don’t know if it is recessive (both parents are carriers) or dominant (one parent has it, but other doesn’t) or de novo mutation (developed spontaneously). Usually in recessive mode of inheritance, both parents carry the disease but they don’t have sz. In dominant forms, some cases are from one parent only. So… idk. No “for sure” answers.

I’ve never been totally sure whether it was a very vivid dream or not. As pre school child I was very prone to having nightmares . For years now though I’ve had poor dream recall. It’s hard to tell when psychosis started. There was a gradual blending of social anxiety into mild depression and anxiety then more severe depression and anxiety. The first psych appointment was a few months before I was 17. The first hospitalisation at the of 18.25 . Perhaps the 1st overt sign of psychosis was thinking I’d lost my teeth.

You need a phone to do the initial setup but nothing after that but they do have an app that can be tied to your account, the Oculus app. It’s expensive, but totally worth it.

And the oculus Go, it’s a subpar version of the quest and doesn’t have hand tracking or a hand set. It’s only good for viewing movies big screen. Yes, the oculus quest has a right and left hand set to track your hands in VR. So you can pick up objects or whatever you wanna do. Also you can use your own hands without the handsets using hand tracking, but that’s still only available on the quest and rift, not

174338837,"# ATP-binding cassette transporter 13 mRNA expression level in schizophrenia patients The objective of this study was to investigate the expression and clinical role of ATP-binding cassette transporter 13 (ABCA13) gene previously shown to be associated with schizophrenia (SZ) through Genome-wide association studies studies. Thirty-two first-episode drug-naive SZ patients and forty-eight age and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. We measured ABCA13 mRNA expression levels using quantitative real-time PCR at baseline and 12 weeks after antipsychotic therapy. Moreover, clinical symptoms were measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at baseline and 12-week follow-up. We found that ABCA13 mRNA levels were significantly lower in SZ patients compared with healthy controls at baseline. SZ patients’ symptoms were decreased, but ABCA13 mRNA levels were increased after 12 weeks antipsychotic therapy. In addition, there was a significant difference in ABCA13 mRNA 
levels among SZ patients at baseline and 12-week follow-up. The ABCA13 mRNA levels were not associated with age, BMI, years of education. Of the clinical symptoms measured, the ABCA13 mRNA levels were negatively associated with the PANSS scores at baseline and 12-week follow-up. The results indicated that the ABCA13 mRNA expression level is of interest, and upon further studies, it could be used as a biomarker for SZ treatment"

I called her back and told her I didn’t think I was getting good care here. _NAME_ said I was going overboard and they can refuse to see me again.

You can still self improve. If all you can do is take a shower every day, cross that off your list and consider yourself proud that you did that much. I know how hard it is. I go through different phases of activity. It’s difficult for me to take care of myself much less stay focused. If you want to talk about it or have an accountability partner or hear more about what works for me, send me a private message. Don’t listen to negative people like your family, that’s for starters (easier said than done)."

175945074,"Authentic. Ya you gotta be honest with others and yourself. Also women tend not to be interested in guys who seem too interested so I’d say focus on other things besides sex. That’s a major issue. Women want someone with whom they can enjoy other things besides sex. Believe me, sex gets old, it’s really biological and basic. I’d say try to focus on other pursuits and try to forget to care about getting laid. Sex is kinda boring and even when it’s good idk. My opinion obviously. Women like dudes who aren’t afraid to get in touch with their feminine side but also who are confident in their masculinity. Even at best sex takes up an hour of the day, leaving 23 hours of other stuff. Just being interested in women isn’t enough. You have to be interesting yourself, and so have other passions. Interesting ones. Get good at arts or music or sports. Women like to be the pursuer often in my experience and like someone who is hard to get. In other words nobody wants to beat the game on easy. Work 
out, maybe try to focus on yourself a little more without becoming narcissistic, but like Green Day said nice guys finish last. Every time I meet a woman it’s when I’m focused on other stuff. Women like men who are busy but still relaxed. If getting laid is the goal you’ll never get there, the goal has to be something else and getting laid is a pleasant side effect. You’re caring too much. You’re overthinking it. But yeah it’s more a matter of making yourself desirable and waiting til a woman chooses you. Pursuit doesn’t often work. And the goal can’t be to be desirable necessarily you have to want to be it for yourself. In my opinion. Be authentic, strong silent type, etc. go to the gym get good at things. As _NAME_ said chicks like guys with skills. _USER_ID_: apologies for the gendered nature of this reply replace any of the gendered words as necessary. I’m a they kinda guy. Liberal af here.

They actually don't care yet they just care about their bottom line. And that's it. And corporate America - that's all they care about as well. Bottom line or nothing. I don't know guys. I am just ranting now. My thoughts are stupid and silly. I have an assessment with a professional mental health person at 4:00 PM today to see about the IOP. Therefore, I can use my hard earned $ on that. Ugh. Ironic thing is, I don't even work that hard or much. I am just stressed cause of COVID. Man, that is the worst thing.

Same thing happened with benzos 6 months ago. I'd abuse them and take 8 and then I couldn't take more than two without feeling weird. I have GABA intolerance (Which is kind of a good thing but now I don't feel good from alcohol and I liked it 5 years ago). Now I'm able to smoke weed when I couldn't before at the time I was able to drink alcohol. At at the same time this reverse happened, my panic attacks disappeared."

175945201,"Thats so great that you’re starting to recover. It takes time to heal so dont beat yourself up about the past. Just take it easy and keep focused on recovery and all the good things that can come with getting better. My mom was dealing with those kinds of delusions, about famous people she thought she was in the band Blondie and she would think all these magazine people were us etc. but she has been well now for about 6 years its like she finally got her life back. I prayed to God that someone would step in or something would change. It seems that God’s answer was that she needed treatment. There’s no shame in treatment. I’ve been getting better lately too."

175945225,That's great!
175945226,i think i would be upset with that family member. i would change my name and move somewhere else. i think.

175945228,I have a personality disorder but no meds seems to fix it.
175945229,"When checking thyroid the normal range vary a lot. For example normal range for TSH is .5 to 5.0 and if found the value anywhere in this range doctors consider it as normal but recent studies shows this range should be reduced further for optimal function. Now a value close to 1.0 is considered optimal and anything over 2.0 is sub optimal and small small symptoms can result like for example memory problems, hair loss, weight gain etc. Also several psychiatric drugs can reduce thyroid function so its vital to monitor thyroid function regularly to prevent side effects of low thyroid hormone levels. The good news is its easy to correct low thyroid level using synthetic thyroid pill."
175945230,Yep. Your meds work. You’re lucky
174338881,I think you have to lower Xeplion too for more sex drive.
175945231,huh. I wonder how that would be
174338891,"Do you have negative symptoms? When I had positive symptoms I had less negative symptoms for some reason, maybe its the dopamine."
174338882,"Are they shying away because of the pain or because they don’t understand you? A lot of people don’t know how to interact with people with schizophrenia! If it’s your family, yes they don’t want to see you in pain and they feel helpless. Other people are just wary about people with this illness because of the _USER_ID_ or because of things they may have done or said!"

175945233,"I agree, don’t tell her she gives lousy needles or say you’ll do it yourself if things don’t go smoothly, bad idea. Just wondering, do you guys like to look when you’re given the needle, or do you sit back and relax with your eyes closed when you receive one?"
175945234,"for my belief, meds should only be your supportive attribute. it must never be mainstream nor you dependant on it. Only true caring , the correct way of loving you and yourself by either you or true friends around you can heal your soul, which is why we suffer a mental breakdown, because we are so hurted in the soul that physically we are showing weird symptoms. these symptoms are the by-product of our past experiences which accumulated over the years of your whole life. even though in a way it is ok to behave that way but in a way not. because in one way or the way, that is you, how you felt, even though it doesn’t reflect the reality that we lived in. so my way of doing things are: exercise quite regularly (my colleague life dumbbells at home, but for me i walk around place and explore while carrying a rather heavy bag to add weigh) escape the environment which is causing your depressed form, (either mind or emotionally), maybe can try spending lesser time at the environment that is causing the 
pain? find true friends, people whom understands and yet accepts you as who you are, while correcting you at the right times. and they are the ones that doesn’t judge you nor label you. learn to protect yourself, don’t give others chance to hurt you. you hold this power in your hands, don’t give others the power over you. find extra help if you need like going to a social worker for more advise and help or emotional support, find more allies that stand with you spiritually and emotionally. Try to find what sleep patterns suits you, different people sleep time might varies. so long you try to achieve most of it, the effects can be great. just do it at your own pace your own style"
175945235,"_AT_MENTION_ , I totally get you worrying about the dr saying he thinks it’s psychosomatic. I think you should first run it by your pdoc to make sure it’s not a med side effect. If it’s not, then I’d go see a primary dr about it. Hopefully they’ll be nice. And that way, you can inform the primary dr that the pdoc says it’s not psychosomatic or your meds causing it"

175945238,"After I started taking Sertraline, my psychosis had gotten worse. I got the ok from my pnurse to go off it to see if that’d help, and it did. That sucks, because it worked wonders for my SAD. Is there any way to go back on it but avoid worsening my psychosis? Or do you know about any other antidepressants that would be good and doesn’t interact with Latuda?"
175945239,"Hi guys. Therapy went well tonight. Regular T was trying to get me to see that SH isn't the problem, its what's underneath it. And she wants me to let myself feel anything and everything that I feel and not stuff it down or punish myself for feelings. She just wants me to care about myself. I'm so not upset anymore. I feel accepted by regular _PERSON_. I think Pastor _PERSON_ cares about me in his own way. We talked about the visual hallucinations I was having this weekend also, and that was helpful. She knew I was scared and she gave me some ideas for dealing with the hallucinations. I feel like I have a few more options than I did before. It was a scary hallucination and it freaked me out. But now I have something else to try when or if it comes back. So that's good. Hugs. _PERSON_"

And I know it’s not real; but it’s always there. A great therapist told me I have a “Soft Delusion” a term I liked… but I’m not sure if it’s universal."

I don’t doubt that in the end its not much of a contribution to society, but being part of the process of improving games is something I’m passionate about.

175945305,"Working at the Library as a volunteer. I was young, it wasn’t painful, I had my family taking care of my needs, and I could take vacations as often as I wanted to. The freedom became less when I was paid."
174338900,Welcome _NAME_! I enjoy your podcast that I believe is titled a schizophrenic and a bipolar.
175945306,"I agree with juli_raven8 that you need someone to talk to. A family member, friend, or a therapist. There is nothing wrong with seeking help and you may find some coping techniques or if necessary, a medication to help organize and calm your thoughts and anxiety. I would try this route before doing anything drastic such as changing jobs, although you might still want to change jobs in the future. It's just that it's not best to do so now if you are having anxiety issues because of the old saying, ""Wherever you go, there you are."" In other words, you want to get control of the issues, otherwise, they just follow you to the next place and so on and so on. But if you can start there, then you will feel like you are taking control of your life and may see clearer where your path should go. No job is worth panic attacks. There's a Scripture that I like to remember in _NAME_ that says, ""Who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his life span?"" So once you feel more clearheaded and calm, maybe yo
u will want to continue at your job. Maybe you will want to find something new, but at least you will feel better prepared to make a decision regarding your future. I wish you the best."
175945307,Therapy was good. Took a half of a gabapentin before I went.
174338909,"So, if you had Depression before, and were subsequently diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, it means you were ill from before I think. I was more Bipolar from childhood. SZ symptoms came slightly before the age of 17. It means I had the Schzizoaffective from before, just that the other symptoms manifested themselves later in life. That would be my interpretation. Do you think Schizoaffective is one glitch or two problems, Bipolar and Schizophrenia separately?"
174338903,"I have catatonia all the time but its not full blown catatonia instead some part of me in stuck states and and other parts I can move. I think its due to low dopamine. Dopamine boosting things helps to relieve catatonia. So medications might be one reason, it might be lowering dopamine too much. Partial dopamine agonists like abilify had improved your catatonia previously so it has something to do with dopamine system."
175945308,Even existing muscles transformed into fat so I likely gained 220+lb of fat.
174338913,"Too much sleep or too little....my standard sleep was ten hours a night for most of my life, sucks until you start going without sleep then it’s a gift....for me in addition to whatever I’ve got going with bipolar I have a mutation in a gene called clock that regulates circadian rhythm...."
175945309,"Yes, with the help of medications I think clearly."
175945310,"Thanks a lot. I haven’t drawn for two years, and it takes a lot of practice to pick it up again. I need to get started and allow myself to fail for a period. And yes, i can’t find motivation either. I need a hypomanic period to start again."
175945311,Music is a splendid idea. I don’t have a PRN as I’m not allowed access to my meds. I will be taking night meds in half an hour though. image1125×2436 155 KB
175945312,"yeah, like am I really a presence. I feel more like a ghost."
175945313,You’re right. I was wrong to even mention it. Maybe you could try a moderate exercise routine. That can improve your mood.
175945314,"Just be careful bb. For me personally, I had to cut out caffeine except for the stuff in sodas/chocolate. I drink decaf from time to time tho but not all the time. Coffee seems to give me major anxiety. It’s hard to accept I know. I used to not be like that but Idk. I also had to limit my alcohol intake within the last few years. As alcohol gave me anxiety too. All that’s stuff above I never dealt with until a few years ago. I would start small and try not to test it too much!"

175945327,There was a good sized brown snake in my garage last year. It was pretty feisty when I coaxed it into a plastic bin with a broom. I then transported the snake to a wild creek area and released it there. I think it was probably a gopher snake.

175945339,Good Morning. Happy Hump Day. My open letter to the parents of bullies at my daughters school made it to the local newspaper and radio station. I’ve also gotten a couple DMs from news stations looking for the “scoop”. I blocked them. I have no intention of making her into a poster child for an anti bullying campaign. Spoke to one of the parents...the one that convinced her parents it wasn’t her. They did NOT take it well. I am a little nervous that because of the publicity and microscope on them that they are going to make an example of these girls. That’s not what I want. I just want them to do better. I’ve also heard that since parents have brought this to their kids they’ve all admitted to knowing about it and hating it but being afraid to step in. So now they are feeling empowered and apparently a couple have decided to turn on the 2 worst girls. Again not my intention. I mean they are all kids. They are full of hormones and invincibility. Their brains don’t work at the same time 
as their mouths. You remember. But most of us weren’t viciously and repeatedly seeking out one person to drop that all on. I don’t know what to do. Guess we’ll just ride the wave. At least the parents are talking about it.

175945359,"Thats what mine did, too. You wear the sensor cap, and it measures different brain activity levels. The goal of a movie is to shut down your prefrontal cortex and engage your limbic system. In other words, make you stop thinking and start feeling. The biofeedback trains you mind to keep the prefrontal cortex active during times of emotional stress, which makes it easier to think rationally and not have extreme emotional responses. The thing about the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex is, they sort of work in opposition. They can’t both be at full power at the same time, because they both produce so much heat that your brain would cook if they did. So when you engage one, the other naturally shuts down."

It works well because it’s a hypnotic and induces sleep, not keeping you asleep, so you wake not feeling drugged.

Even when i recently asked if i could use them as a reference, nothing. Dont tell anyone, people suck."

I'm going to trigger warn this even though I am not talking numbers but because I am talking about weight loss applications I don't want to trigger anyone. Possible trigger: IDK its kind of expensive but it's day five and I've already lost a few pounds. I had to totally change the way I was eating. But it's good. I'm being much more mindful about what I eat now instead of just whatever Mom or Dad put in front of me. I'm hoping it will help my prediabetes numbers to go back to not having prediabetes. But we'll see. You get a goals coach that you talk to like once a week and then apparently later in the program you have like a group coach and you are put into a group to work with people like you. I don't know how I feel about that part but maybe it will be okay. Oh and there are daily lessons. It takes maybe 10 minutes a day plus food logging, weight logging, and I log blood pressure. So far I'm pretty happy that I'm trying it because s
tupid AP's make me hungry. The first couple of days (it's been 5 days) that I was using Noom I was really hungry. So I had to adjust what I was eating and when I was eating. Like I needed more calories in the morning. I can still eat Tacos on it. There are no ""bad"" foods just better foods. There's no foods you can't eat. It's supposed to be a lifestyle change not a diet. I'm pretty impressed so far. I hope I keep making progress because Rexulti made me way too fat. Anyways, I kind of like it."

They not only thought they were better than people with mental illnesses, but also thought they were more deserving of support .

Here, we investigated the current evidence on the usefulness of mindfulness-based interventions in these two populations. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the literature according to the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Among the 102 references retrieved, 9 responded to the inclusion criteria (8 in FEP patients and 1 in UHR individuals). In FEP patients, mindfulness interventions 
are well-tolerated and have a satisfactory level of adherence. The clinical benefits consist primarily of reduced anxiety and sadness and improved quality of life. None of the studies reported any increase in positive symptoms. Conclusion: Future sham-controlled studies with large sample sizes are needed to definitively conclude on the clinical interest of mindfulness-based interventions in FEP patients and UHR individuals as well as to understand their underlying mechanisms of action."

To give an illustration to a person who not have OCD consider you witnessed an accident that memory can be so shocking and you might find it hard to dismiss from mind easily.

Derealisation occurs when our reality and surroundings feel and appear distorted and we become highly aware that we feel ‘different’ from our usual selves. Similar to derealisation is the symptom of depersonalisation. This is when the focus is mainly on the self and it feels like the person who is experiencing it is ‘observing’ themselves. (…) If you are going through feelings of derealisation and depersonalisation, you needn’t worry as the symptom is remarkably common and, in most cases, physically harmless."

My mom is going to be working 12 hour days or something so it's much worse for her - And she's cooking the dinners etc. Some of what the ""soldiers"" said to me about my identity is true. Idk how I manage to hear the perfect things in my life at 
the right time.. Seems suspicious.. I was walking across the road and I get pissed at cars revving their engines and making turns exactly where I think they're going to go.. It's like they do it to piss me off.. I saw that guy yesterday and I should have said ""You better leave me alone"". He seems like such an idiot too. I'm drinking a chamomile tea and might take 5mg of diazepam. I only took two this week. I'm taking less and less - I couldn't do that with alprazolam because the half life was too short. It's pretty easy to taper with diazepam. I haven't decided what I wanted to do today but at the end I'll take a zopiclone and go to sleep, wake up and it will be a much better day. I refilled my meds and my Invega injection is now back to every 3 weeks instead of 4."

174339001,"So I know that almost all schizophrenic people hear voices, however I don’t know how many of them think they are voices of real people and it is a sort of remote hearing or something. Which is what I believe anyway, I know it’s a little crazy to think that but these voices I hear are definitely not from me, I don’t think like that and I’ve heard some crazy crazy things that they have been talking about over the last 3 years, things that I couldn’t think up if I ever tried. Secrets about what the government does and stuff like that. I believe that they pick on schizophrenic people on purpose because if you get someone like me who has dedicated a lot of time trying to figure out where these voices are coming from and why I am hearing them and actually figure it out they obviously don’t want their secrets spilled, however they target people that are not as creditable such as people with mental illnesses or drug addictions, after all who would believe someone that hallucinates or is addicte
d to drugs? The thing is I may hear voices from time to time but I still managed to hold my job as a Process Engineer which I got without having a degree because I am an intelligent person. I know what is real and not. There are just a lot of theroies I have that have a question mark at the end because I can’t say for 100% certaintly that these theories are correct because they are mainly based off of the things I have heard the voices talking about when they didn’t know I could hear them. As soon as I would talk back to them they would start being really careful about what they said, they eventually told each other to start writing things down if they needed to talk about me so I couldn’t hear them. What makes some of the things I heard more believable than others is when I hear the same thing said by multiple people and over a long period of time. Things that I had literally forgot that they had said until it gets brought up again a year or so later. Anyway, I’ve slowly been able to start putting th
e dots together and make some sense of the weird things that have actually happened in reality. I could go on and on about the little weird things, such as when I was put in a temporary apartment after someone burned my house down while I was at work I went to get the key when I first moved in and the lady walked me to my apartment and let me in, I proceeded to hang out on the balcony while to stay out of the way of the movers. I heard her going door to door and telling all of the neighbors that I was moving in and told them my first and last name, first off that is illegal and I’ve never heard of that happening to anyone before nor have I ever been notified of who just moved in next to me. Not sure why but definitely weird right? I don’t get why these people think it is okay to break the law and tell everyone and their mom about my private life that seems to be on public display for some reason. The hardest thing I’m trying to figure out is why I would be so important to anyone to monitor/spy on me and 
who would have the resources to do that and what is their purpose and intentions? I think it has been to use me as a lab rat honestly. I have had medications tampered with as well. When I moved back into my house after the fire I immediately started hearing voices again and heard one of my neighbors say that he put a camera in my room so he could monitor me because he thought I was a serial killer. WTF I didn’t believe that was true or that anyone would be that dumb but the things I’ve heard since point to that being true. Some how people around me and family members know specific details about my private life that they would never possibly know unless someone was spying on me. People can only lie for so long without slipping up, and they have slipped up a lot and either haven’t noticed that they did or think I’m ???????? and didn’t notice it. I know for 100% certainty that there is at least something very very weird going on here and I will get to the bottom of it eventually. I will literally do cr
azy things in private on purpose to see if anyone in my life acts differently or hints towards things when talking and they do. Just the other day I had my ex girlfriend who I haven’t really talked to or seen in like 6 months tell me that she heard what I had told my other friend a week ago in private, and they don’t even know each other, nor would the person I talked to ever tell anyone what I had asked her for. It was a test and it told me a lot. I do not understand, it feels like everyone around me talks about me behind my back and they say its cuz they care which is funny cuz they talk about me but never to me. They are probably talking about me while I’m sitting at home alone loosing my mind because I’m so bored or don’t have people to hang out with or anyone that I feel I can trust to talk to about this crap that is going on. The main thing I’m worried about is if they are in on whatever the hell it is and I tell them everything then they will know how lie to me better and what not to do any
more and my mental sanity (pretty much my life) depends on figuring this out and putting and end to it so I can life my life in peace. I tried to kill myself a couple weeks ago and ended up just passing out in my truck and woke up in the hospital, its the 3rd time in the last year I’ve been forcefully held at the psych ward, who would wanna be with someoen like that rigtht? If I had someone to do things with, care about, feel cared for, talk to, help keep my head on straight when I start getting a little crazy and not alone all the time just talking to voices of evil people that are never going to stop ??????? with me until I kill them apparently. How many times to I have to threaten people before I you come arrest me??? Come one I want some ??????? ansers already and I would rather just ask you nicely to give me answers instead of having to be an ??????? and scare ppl in order to get whoever to come arrest me but the truth is that important so whats it gonna be? Also, you I know the day that I accidentally 
shot myself in the hand that my. I got a knock on my front door, opened it and there was a animal control officer there who instantly noticed I was bleeding very bad, there was a pool of blood on the floor within about 30 seconds. I told him what happened, he told me to hang tight and he would be back. About 2 minutes later he was back with 2 police officers and 4 paramedics with an ambulance and proceeded to tell me I needed to get in the ambulance. They said they had found _NAME_ around 1st and Taft, I think she was going to my dads, however I do not believe that they were telling me the truth, because considering I am being spied on they saw I had show You guys knew I shot myself and didn’t want me to bleed out cuz I wasn’t planning on going to the hospital. I do not go to hospitals voluntarily usually, they didn’t use stitches or glue or anything other than just clean it. Then they proceeded to send me to the psych ward for 5 days even though it was an accident."

175945770,"We have had a “socialist” president, but socialist party here was a kind of soft-social-democracy pro-capitalism like in GB with _NAME_ or _NAME_ in Germany. We have had a “real” socialist president (_PERSON_) in 1981, it was a time more favorable to the Leftist. Well, I don’t know what kind of system i would like to have. Anyway I will not go further, because I already approach the limit on the forum. I would just say that I really appreciate what the current US administration is doing. I just think that the American socialists are much more socialists than the French socialists now. By the way, French social security is a kind of socialist system where everyone contributes (companies, employees, etc.) and everyone is protected. This is what works best in France. The retirement system is a bit similar.(dividing system) . Everyone contributes, everyone get the retirement pension."
175945771,"Sometimes doing things like laundry, cleaning, etc. even when you don’t feel like it helps. Try just plunging in and doing things instead of waiting to get out of despair.

175945777,"I’ve always thought my insight is good , but that may be wishful thinking to some extent. The reality is friends and family members can notice things that don’t necessarily register with us. That was certainly the case with the autism assessment, and may be applicable to other areas too. A small example. I’ve always seen myself as having no problems when it comes to road safety. My stepdaughter however has said my road safety skills are very poor , and that I often walk across the road without looking. She often accompanies me when I go out. If I’m honest I struggle to see this one as being true. That is not to say that she is wrong , but to say it doesn’t register with me."

175945793,Yes I did!
175945794,I need to refill my self care box. What do you guys put in it?
175945795,How to get rid of this feeling?
174339031,I’m either feeling better because of a recent anti-psychotic meds change or because my Metformin was doubled up.

175945797,"Yeah. There is a parasite, actually a giant tape worm called Taenia. It causes rapid weight loss. But it’s not so common to get it. Have you recently drunk water or eaten pork meat with dubious origins?"
175945798,I throw up everyday. It’s almost like my stomach is really small. I mostly throw up when I chug water or coffee.
175945799,Eat some chocolate . I think I’ll do that now in fact !
175945800,"i know how u feel.u cant do anything but take medication,listen to music.good luck."
174339036,Yes. Agranulocytosis is a possible side-effect where it wipes out your white blood cells. Happened to me and the pneumonia nearly killed me. Lungs have been a bit messed ever since. Never EVER take Clozaril without proper medical oversight.
175945801,"yeah iq doesnt really mean anything with working, you can have a low iq and work menial jobs still. its like whats the point of an iq of 160 if you cant do much with it. its more the social skills and willpower and emotional iq that helps with working any job"

175945803,"Yes, I finished high school. Prior to the diagnosis, however, I consider it a slight achievement and a worthy accomplishment partly to honour my parents."
175945804,Try to stay in reality and breath. Obviously the psychiatrist didn’t gave you antipsychotics. Maybe don’t watch the exorcist again.
174339026,"I don’t mean to be negative or derail the topic, but it’s really hard to read what you’re writing when you don’t use punctuation. It makes the sentences really long and hard to follow But to be on topic, yes, I often blame myself for things even if they’re out of control. I blame myself for my negatives, for the things I’ve done in life that made things worse, for not being more active, for not doing things normies can do, etc… I used to blame myself for getting schizophrenia. I thought it was bad karma for having been such an arsehole when I was younger. Even though I’ve most likely always had schizophrenia."

175945810,I put this in the DX’d thread so it can include symptom related stuff. Self acceptance has really helped the last few years so here we go. What’s a symptom that makes you feel different but that you think you could learn to love about yourself? I’ll start. My train of thought can really go off the rails. It’s labeled as disorganized thinking and it can make some things difficult. I’ve come to love it because I also find some really creative ideas at times.
175945811,when it’s time to publish and find an agent…if that’s not possible you can always self publish…iuniverse publishing lets you publish on demand books for $700. the reason I am telling you is because another author on here spent $7000 to get published and that is a scam.

175945821,"Psychotherapists believe in changing negative, irrational beliefs that their clients with mental health issues have with more positive, rational beliefs. And one topic many counselors talk about during therapy sessions is about mind reading. For example, some people who have issues with getting along with others, or some of those who have problems with relationships with others, think they know what other people are thinking, perhaps about them, whether it be folks in their lives whom they know well, or people that they hardly know. Therapists point out that you can't read other people's minds. You don't know what they believe. You don't know what they're thinking. Interesting. What do you think about mind reading? Have you heard therapists talk about mind reading?"

174339032,I want to be as normal as possible and that includes getting prolactin sorted. Hope Abilify will work for me because on risperidone I am 100% normal except for prolactin.

When i search there is one disease that it can caused by catheter use which is epididimitis. ?ts look serious disease and i m afraid to get this disease. My doctor said its really low possibities to get from catheter use but i m afraid it.uti also may cause this disease. Anyone got this disease. ?f so how did you get this disease.
175945852,"Thank you, _PERSON_!!!"
175945853,"Hi yes hopefully the zyprexa will work. I’m not finding the lyrica is working for me either, but my pdoc doesn’t want to mess around with withdrawing me from any of my other meds just yet. Maybe in a couple of weeks time when I see her she’ll cut back some more. I’m still very on edge, restless and anxious. As you know I have somataform disorder and depression and anxiety so its difficult I suppose to get the right treatment while I’m the way I am. My pdoc told me, theres no quick fix so just trying the different meds at the moment, plus it takes time for these to work. I’m hopeful I’ll get better than what I am right now. Glad you doing well."

175945866,"Raising my hand. Yes. Also in my early 30s. I’m on an immunosuppressant for a autoimmune disease that’s been in complete remission for several years so otherwise healthy. I take care of my mom who is in the at risk age category along with having every high risk factor including being on long term oxygen for lung disease. I’ve been staying in and not going to stores. Luckily my workplace closed, not sure if I’ll have a job at the end of this but will be happy just for my mom and me to make it through. Also was living paycheck to paycheck. This morning I woke up with a sore throat, I’m probably fine since I have isolated myself for a week and taken precautions for about 2 or more. Decided to wait til Thursday to get my infusion of immunosuppressant tho but still super scared the nurse that gives it might be carrying the virus and pass it to us. I’m in a county that already has a high number of cases. That being said- make sure your parents stay home if they can. Have food delivered. Hopin

174339028,"Yes, Abilify/Clozapine combination is a popular one. You could also try increasing the dose of the Clozapine, and once better, decrease it-- since you are obviously having side effects with this medication at a higher dose than 200."

175945882,"Wow. My roommate just talked major trash about me to her sister while in the living room. She told her I never clean and all I do is mow the lawn, take out the trash, and shovel snow, which she said she does a lot anyways. She didn't shovel the snow once and mowed the lawn once so far this year. She apparently forgot I've never been late on rent once, and meanwhile, she needs to borrow $400 from this this week because so far she's 22 days late with rent like every month. So after she said all of that I asked her if she was mad at me, and she laughed and brushed it off. So I'm going to marinate on her negativity now. I thought we were friends."
175945883,"They’re reasonable. I had to overstep them to get my way though. If I didn’t do that I’d still be on injections. What I did wasn’t entirely ethical, but I absolutely hated the injections.

175945888,When did you become ill? Are you stable now? How’s your life now?
175945889,"Hm. I wasnt worried at all. I was more worried about all the responses of people panicking and thought “it is just a flu…it will pass…what is all the fuss about?”. But i danced with someone who had symptoms of a cold (coughing, etc) on wednesday and tonight i have a very slight sore throat and cough. I never have fevers, even with severe infection, so i dont know what to watch out for. Im not concerned about myself at all. But i met someone i know who has lung problems in town today and she surprised me with a kiss on the cheek. Im afraid for her. And also for my dad. I just lost mum, i dont want dad to get ill, especially not because of me. What should i do? I never follow news…"

175945891,thanks sp! that's very interesting...
175945892,"Thank God for family, huh?"
175945893,It helps a little. I feel nothing really. No pounding chest or whatever. I drink them over the course of a day and don’t exercise or do much. I do get elevated pulse and blood pressure. Same with cigs. I think the meds are to blame sometimes. I like Vraylar though. Makes me feel normal. I hated all the other ones. Latuda felt like water but I did enjoy not feeling medicated. I really think the meds interfere with these drinks. I feel like a stupid kid sometimes.
174339054,I supposedly have a lot of hallucinations. For me they are usually more distracting than distressing. If that makes any sense? The negative symptoms definitely kill my quality of life but I don’t think I’d call them the most distressing for me either. To me it’s the disorganized thoughts and the cognitive symptoms. I hate having to re-read a paragraph several times to process it. I hate having delayed responses. I hate forgetting basic directions. I hate it when people aren’t able to understand what I’m trying to communicate. I hate rambling off topic without realizing I’m doing it. I hate having my mind go completely blank mid sentence. What about you guys? What’re your most distressing symptoms?

175945900,"In horrible pain. The stupid nurse ignored my request for a patch and I had to go track her down and ask for a patch.

What will I do?"
175945901,My family understands because they went through some bat ???? crazy episode I had. It was completely extreme. So thats pretty much why they are understanding. And they’ve seen me struggle with a bunch of other episodes (thankfully not traumatizing for them like the first one)

I did a mandatory reconsideration and included a strong supporting letter from my stepdaughter but got stung by a bureaucratic catch 22 . I’d said I don’t go out much so they turned me down on that basis. The reason I don’t go out much and only round a small area I know? A poor sense of direction . My stepdaughter takes me to things I have to get to , but I don’t ask her to take me to places I just fancy going to. If I could pay her with the PIP money I would . In essence I’d go out more If I had PIP to pay my stepdaughter for petrol ,but because I don’t go out much I can’t get the mobility component . Even though I meet the unfamiliar journeys criteria."

How would you tell the difference between mixed state and just being grumpy? It lasts longer in bipolar? idk.. I had an iced coffee and it had a lot of sugar in it so I should probably eat cuz the benefits of having a bit of sugar are gone cuz it resets the fasting so I'd just lose weight. Water fasting isn't really for losing weight though cuz you gain it back when you're finished. It's mostly about rebuilding immune system, getting rid of pre-cancer cells, burning a slight amount of fat more efficiently (Because if you just eat less, you're not in ketosis so you lose way more weight), helping the brain and cognition etc.."

175945916,Don’t consider it your fault if you can’t maintain a “healthy” weight on the meds. I theorize that for some folks it’s literally impossible. I was very psychically active myself (although slowly gaining weight throughout that time) until my feet developed plantar fasciitis. Then it became painful to walk and the weight piled on. The death of my father and moving out on my own increased my tendency to binge on many types of food. And finally diabetes made me too weak to exercise much. (and the weight piled on). It’s like trying to win at shadow boxing. And yes I don’t think I have long to go myself.
175945917,I was thin too but yeah definitely theAPs...no question they change your metabolism...and how much you eat. I’m pissed about it too but if you eat mostly vegetables you can get your bacterial flora closer to normal again.

175945934,"In 2008 things changed re the CPA. The Approach was implemented from April 1991 onwards. It was reviewed and refined in 1999 and then amended further in 2008. Since then, although everyone using secondary mental health services remains entitled to a high level of care, the Care Programme Approach has been designated for use only with people who have wide-ranging service needs, or are particularly at risk. In making this change, the Department of Health’s intention was to reduce bureaucracy for service users with less complex needs. https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/CPA_research_study.pdf page 8/116 People like me who were deemed (wrongly) not to have complex needs, and thus had been on a standard CPA, lost our care coordinators. Where I am now though you automatically have a care plan , which is normally reviewed at least once a year. My main depot nurse also serves as my care-coordinator."

Whilst I don’t know how much you acted up when younger. There is a fact here, you have hallucinated a voice, that does need to be investigated. And it’s very much likely a result of psychotic brain response to your surroundings or situations. You should put trust into the label (don’t be identified by it or associated to it out of no choice but understand it as a medical issue that requires medical intervention)."

175946030,"Instead of one train of thought last night, I was having 2-3-4-5 different trains of thought and I wasn't using ""I"". I was like ""You should do this"", ""You're ok"", ""It's all madness"", ""Did that really happen?"", ""Wait until you become sedated and then you can check your phone"", ""You don't like the sound of the cars driving by so close the window"" then I said ""But I like the sound of cars while I'm sleeping"" - ""I don't think you do, do I? do you?"". Eventually the dissociation went away. People such as my family were inside my head. I don't know if I believe that that's possible physically but in some metaphysical way, everyone that we react with, we become.. It just shows more while having depersonalization. That's the effects of abusing psychedelics."
175946031,"I tried everything. I closed my eyes, focused, tried hard, but nothing, no voices at all"
175946032,I still want to recover!!! I have not given up on that just yet!!!
175946033,Sounds like a good idea. Hope you hear from them soon enough
175946034,I get calls everyday for work and about 2 a day for them coming to arrest me for taxes. Like the tax dept would call and warn me they are coming lol
174339074,"Don’t feel too bad, I’m doing the same thing right now. I’m slowly saving money from my disability checks toward a car so I can get back out there but it’s taking awhile. I spend a lot of time on the forum or gaming, and I try to help with things around the apartment but there’s not a lot of stuff to clean. It’s paradise compared to being locked up, even if it’s not very productive. However you could say I’m working on my recovery by letting time pass, adjusting medication, and working on coping techniques. I am pretty sure you’re smarter than a chimp. I’m still pretty smart, I just feel dumb sometimes because of the negative symptoms. Chimps aren’t intelligent enough to play video games."
174339075,IDK. I don’t think schizophrenia is that popular with anybody.

174339076,I for the most part only deal with delusions on any regular basis. Sometimes my vision has artifacts. I also tend to think I hear my mom calling from the other room when she’s not. Generally I feel that I don’t experience positive symptoms outside of delusions. I take a depression medicine for ongoing depression and have decreased motivation.

175946041,Hmmm… your choice … you suffer the consequences.

175946043,Today has been a struggle voices loud and anxiety is high. I almost had a panic attack at my son’s school orientation I was trying to hide it from everyone including my kids. Its rough.
175946044,Meds can’t cause that. Did you take any drugs in your life?
175946045,"I’ve often pondered the aspect of nihilism within our respective illnesses. I always come to the conclusion that it’s only pointless if you make it pointless.

I prefer absurdism, it does matter, because we can make meaning to it. _PERSON_ that though with insight, meaning can dip into delusion. Wishing well for you."

175946048,"I think it’s a wrong thing to say for all those who are on contraception, and don’t consider themselves lazy and fat. I’m lazy and fat but it’s not because I can’t have any more kids. I need to work on myself."

175946056,"I think the meds do contribute to paranoia, at least in my case. Because they make me feel like I’m crumbling away, weak, so I get paranoia about people taking advantage of me etc etc I also think it’s the psychosis experience in itself it makes me really more anxious about things than before."
175946057,My delusions are gone but I still hear voices. They don’t give me commands anymore. Recovery is a process that never really ends with this disease. You gain a little ground every day you go without a relapse and stick with your medicine.

175946065,"That’s really interesting. I feel that it does a lot for me and I’m only taking relatively small doses of niacin. I’m a very sensitive person though so maybe I do better on smaller doses. I don’t think I could manage doing like 5grams of niacin, but I might experiment going up a little more if it feels beneficial. For me niacin and vitamin D seems to be most important, but I also take standard doses of zinc, magnesium, coq10, lechitin, L-lysine, NAC, L-Serine and B-complex. I’m currently also experimenting with taking serotonin boosters in the morning.(I take meds in evening which inhibit serotonin/dopamine) So far so good. I feel that they are giving me a little of my old self back in regards to mood and general well beeing."

175946067,It's when the heart QTc interval is higher than 500 milliseconds and the heart muscles criss-cross and the heart stops.. My QTc was 465 milliseconds when I did the ECG on Seroquel but the doctor said that it's normal. So it must be all in my head. I get delusions of heart arrhythmias because I have hyper awareness of my heart cuz I feel my ribs when I lay down...

175946095,I had some insight from the very beginning but I chose to ignore it and go into denial because I didn’t want my psychosis and suicidal depression interfering with my nursing career. But my symptoms eventually became so bad that they forced the issue.
174339078,I've been recovering in a few different ways & this morning I seem to have experienced some sort of breakthrough. I'm actually feeling stronger physically & mentally.
175946096,Please try more anti depressants I had to go through several different drugs before I got the desired result. This is very much a thing where its not like you’re not treatable after only having done one drug and it not working.

This is nature's trick - the ego, the sense we are someone when we know it will all end.

174339079,"Hi all, Had a prescriber appointment yesterday, and she wants to bump up Abilify from 10mg to 15mg-- she’s been trying to increase the dose since our first visit back in November. I felt like that was a kinda hasty decision, especially since it was our first time meeting, plus the jump from 10mg to 15mg seemed super high. Yesterday, I mentioned that I was having some breakthrough symptoms, and she was real adamant about going to 15mg. These breakthrough symptoms aren’t anything I can’t handle, and my functioning has been decent on 10mg. 15 mg worries me-- I don’t want to be overly-medicated, I don’t want to re-experience the restlessness, and I’m worried about more side effects. I want to trust my prescriber’s judgement. After all, she’s had the training and makes the big bucks-- but I can’t help but feel hesitant about this increase. So I guess my questions are: Has anybody made the jump from 10mg to 15 mg? What was it like? How do you feel being on a higher dose? Should I just s
tick to 10mg? Any advice? Thanks!"

I'm sorry I don't think I would know what to tell you about all of this. It sounds very complicated. Perhaps there will be other members, here on PC, who will have some suggestions they can offer. What occurs to me is simply that you can't control what another person does or change them. I know you wrote you love B very much. But no matter how much you may love her, you can't make her do what she needs to do to heal. She has to do that for herself.

175946164,So my dad is having cataract surgery on Monday.....I don’t want to forget about him because he’s been doing such a great job taking care of my mom and now my sister will be there too. So I’ve got a choice to make either I get him a less expensive maybe $25 Applebee’s gift card which is my go to gift for him or I get him a peanut sampler that’s more like $50. Part of me was really excited about the 8 flavors of peanuts but the rest is like $50 is too much for peanuts. They go to _PERSON_’s every Monday so I was thinking of joking that he might miss _PERSON_’s “on the day” due to surgery. Anyway which would you guys pick?
175946165,I have my beliefs about the numbers… but I can’t talk about it here…I don’t think they are bad… I use them as a guide… the only one that scares me a little is 8:18 because that’s when I had my first episode…

175946167,Try them long enough and sleep is good and mentally you may be better… It works over placebo and stopping suddenly isn’t a good route …but we all pay the _NAME_ in the end.
175946168,"Well, good, since you know what's triggering the panic attacks you can try to resolve the thoughts and feelings. Have you had any guests in your apartment since you moved in? Maybe if your sister sees your apartment she can reassure you that the place is clean and tidy enough."
175946169,I’m confident at loving. Maybe in prayer but I’m not religious. I’m not super good at anything I can think of.

175946174,"Hmmmm I’m sure if you list him as a family friend or something, it would be fine. If your old case manager is down to be a reference, then that’s awesome! I usually just have my references talk about my punctuality and good attitude towards work"
175946175,This deep sadness inside of me. I don’t know what to do. I feel myself falling into a dark place with no way to stop it.
175946176,"Well you are probably right that it’s not worth the risk. However, I spoke to a lawyer and he said that a person he went to law school with a man who had committed manslaughter. So for law school anyways, it is perfectly possible to become a lawyer even with a manslaughter charge."

175946181,We’re dog sitting and the dogs woke me up. Now the dogs are sleeping on my side of the bed and I’m awake lol. How does that work? When I need a nap later they better be good dogs and let me sleep not crawl all on top of me and try to lick in my mouth like they do. Yuck. lol.

175946189,Its really not a helpful thread guys.
175946190,It’s been out since 2019. Oh. If only there’s a way to make it stop. Do you take meds? Sometimes it doesn’t work for me

Maintenance is going to put an access panel in where the hole is tomorrow so in the future they have easy access if there's ever a problem again instead of having to cut another hole. Then he's shampooing my carpets and putting in a new smoke detector. They're done for today and everything else will be completely done by Thursday at the latest.
175946203,_PERSON_ it caused me terrible akathisia that made me wakeup everynight and not being able to sleep for 1-2h later. I dont know how I was living like that and working for 9 months. Did you try Benzatropine for the akathisia?

175946223,"I would define psychotic episodes as any symptoms of hallucinations or delusions, cognition. By my own definition of it, I’m psychotic daily. With episodes of worsening I’ve not had a break for over 24 hours in 22 years. I’ve always got some form of mild symptoms. When I have a ramp up of episode, they can normally last 3 days to weeks, before I return to baseline Mild 2/10 symptoms. Like a dial someone turns up, subtle, then in a flash I may recognize it’s been turned up. Music, quiet, dark. The least stress the best. My family and dogs, having someone ground me while I’m not doing to hot. Would love to hear everyone else’s answers."

175946227,"If you call your doctor they will probably give you a nausea med like phenergan or ondasterone. That’s good your switching meds, good luck on the next go! I used to switch meds all the time and once I had a new med in my system my thoughts became clear shortly after."
175946228,I am on 441mg Ariata every 4 weeks. I’ve always responded well to meds from Risperdal to this. I was on Invega which gave me secere negatives.

175946231,I think the best results come from good support and treatment as soon as possible . Once you get to a certain age having had incompetent treatment and poor support then the chances of doing really well greatly diminish .

175946233,"Thanks _USER_ID_. I’m seeing my pdoc Thursday about this. It just started up the last couple of weeks. I did hear a voice in the hallway, and it sounds like someone is messing around my front door. When I open the door, no one is there. The stuff on the TV set just started last night. I emailed my psychiatric care provider last night, and this morning _PERSON_ wants me to see Dr _NAME_."

175946244,"I don’t think he put something. I had my first psychosis when I started smoking weed. My friend told me that I became abnormal saying nonsense and acting weird. He told me if its the weed that did this to me but later said that its how my body and genes reacted to it. I had catatonic behavior too, was frozen on the couch not moving looking at the ceiling for more than an hour. I also became aggressive with my family after the catatonia faded. I wonder if I would have had sz if I never smoked weed. I am sure I would have been better than now."

175946246,"“A delusion is a belief that is clearly false and that indicates an abnormality in the affected person’s content of thought. The false belief is not accounted for by the person’s cultural or religious background or his or her level of intelligence. The key feature of a delusion is the degree to which the person is convinced that the belief is true. A person with a delusion will hold firmly to the belief regardless of evidence to the contrary. Delusions can be difficult to distinguish from overvalued ideas, which are unreasonable ideas that a person holds, but the affected person has at least some level of doubt as to its truthfulness. A person with a delusion is absolutely convinced that the delusion is real.

174339108,"The AP I'm on is Rexulti. I don't know if my Pdoc gave me that for depression or the hallucinations. I guess it can be used either way. I took seroquel before for a while and then I wasn't on an AP and then the doctor put me back on an AP but put me on Rexulti because he said a lot of people respond well to it. Although it made me ravenously hungry and I gained a ton of weight on it. It did help for like three months but then it doesn't seem to be working that great. He bumped me up to another mg of the stuff and there was a little improvement for about a week and then not much. He might switch stuff up when I go see him in February because he doesn't even know about my suicide attempt yet. My anxiety feels like it is hard to breathe and I get really restless.

It makes it hard to know what is actually going on. Do you see this at all? I cannot afford a T rt now either. Shame, but we do what we must do. I try to read stuff, do yoga, meditate, exercise. What I can. Asparagae, I care deeply about you, I truly do. It has been my observation over the months listening to you that decision-making can sometimes be a challenging area for you. I relate to that. Do you have thoughts about what could be behind this difficulty? Is there fear about something? For me, it is only the biggest decisions. My fear is that my life will be forever ruined if I make the wrong choice. Hugs!!"
175946268,The ???? that flies over my head constantly during the whole day is proportioned to the amount I am constantly filtering my persona around just to stay or pretend to be sane.
174339106,"Yes, many… in short: I agree with his criticism of solipsism as a philosophical position, and in so far as _PERSON_ interprets schizophrenics as proponent of that ‘position’ I am with Read. But this is not the only way to think of solipsism. On the other hand I find _PERSON_ unclear in his use of the term, so I am unsure whether _PERSON_ criticism really touches _PERSON_’ position, whether _PERSON_ really commits to there being such a solipsist position. Reads austere reading of schizophrenic language as nonsense is superficial and insufficiently argued for, and this goes back to the limited view of meaningfulness of the tractarian _PERSON_. Read asserts there is no _PERSON_ understanding of schizophrenics possible but does not properly argue for that. His reasoning seems to be ‘_PERSON_ does not succeed so no one can succeed’, both the antecedent and the conclusion of which seem unwarrented to me"

175946287,"Well the current methodology of anti-psychotic and anti sz treatment is to lower dopamine levels in the brain, thus alcohol raises dopamine levels in the brain in which APs try to block so it is reasonable to suggest that for those that hear voices alcohol could induce them. “Among these, dopamine has received special attention, because several studies have found that alcohol stimulates the activity of a subset of dopamine -releasing neurons and thus enhances dopamine -mediated (i.e., dopaminergic 1) signal transmission in a discrete brain area called the nucleus accumbens” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826820/"
175946288,It's like the universe sets me up for these types of situations.. I identify with empathy. But you make me realize that it's ok to feel the way I normally feel with a little irritableness etc but I think you've built a character and morals on top of that with life experience so you're able to feel good so I think for me going blindly into that state is s bad thing.

174339113,I really think that if you have schizophrenia it is not something you could have prevented. People said it was the mother’s fault in the past. My mom was/is the most supportive person to me. It may not have been how you got it. You just noticed it because of how the weed effected you because I have actually thought that if i smoked weed or was normal like everyone else I would’ve never gotten schizophrenia. Because I was clean my whole life until I had the symptoms of schizophrenia and it became unmanageable without help.

174339122,"Hi and Happy New Year to everyone. I'm back at Psych Central after a long hiatus during which I was mostly psychotic. I've had four different diagnoses--PTSD, bi polar, schizophrenic, and schizoaffective disorder--so I don't really know what I am except I have definitely spent the last 10 or so years in and out of psychotic states. I definitely have PTSD but I may have one of the other disorders, too. The PTSD forum here has always been very slow so I thought I'd try hanging out here since I have a some kind of delusional disorder, for sure. My main issue right now is dealing with the fact that I was delusional so often and for such a long time and it's been a shock to accept. I'm on Zypraxa now (generic) and am currently psychosis-free, thank goodness. I pulled out of it last July when I got the right meds, but I'm still reeling a bit from the realization I've been so ill for such a long time--this last period I was delusional for over two years. I used to be very active here at Psych Central but 
was away since 2017 because I got too paranoid to post, then later didn't have an internet connection on my computer for a while. However I could read the blogs at the main Psych Central site from my phone and have done so with weekly regularity. Anyway, I have an internet connection again, although it's of irregular strength, but I hope it will be enough to post here again regularly. thanks for being here, _PERSON_"

175946333,I thought some more about the idea of getting off all my meds and onto an injection but I think I'm going to stay on the meds I'm on.

175946345,"At one point or another I felt like I am 8-9 years old lol. I’m not, but it feels like that sometimes. Sometimes, it’s good not to over express things. I act immature and childish. It could be the asperger’s syndrome I have. I was always different. I got schizo-affective disorder depressive type, but wouldn’t be surprised if I got DID/MPD too or the latter instead. Nobody noticed my asperger’s until the psychosis hit. Then I started regressing and acting different. My mom and people thought I had adhd growing up. I also had behaviorial problems growing up but don’t know. A lot of teenagers especially when raised by jerks can come off as narcissists. I don’t know. I sometimes wonder if my family secretly hated me for being semi-successful, entitled, arrogant, smart, and especially a staunch atheist."

175946386,"_NAME_ show delusion is an unfortunate thing. Your brain is chronically inflamed and generating too much adrenaline which has trouble clearing out. It oxidizes and forms “adrenochrome”, which is the compound responsible for the LSD high, so you’re basically “tripping” 24/7. Metaphysically, it’s like spiritually gating to the “realm of consciousness”, and you’re generating a very strong “spiritual signal”, so the consciousness layers responsible for the thought processes of beings around you are interacting / “playing” with you, by humoring your crazy narrative. It can get pretty malicious, for two reasons. One is that your brain is stressed to the limit, so you view these interactions through a negative lens automatically, and two, it’s the worst kind of infringement of your privacy. I’m doing what I can to break out of it. It’s a grind. Have to heal my gut / brain axis perfectly to minimize brain inflammation. I’m trying to accomplish this while eating fairly aver

Somebody else who's been dxed as depressed who is really manic-depressed. What did they do, skip med school? How do they do this? OK, let me guess: 10 years. 10 years of being misdiagnosed as depressive when you were really manic-depressed. You went in as depressed. That was your first mistake. Nobody's perfect. Why? Because when you go in as depressed, they dx you as depressed. Why? Because they didn't ask you if you've ever had racing thoughts. How do I know this? Well, maybe because I was misdiagnosed for 10 years as depressed and I was really manic-depressed. And they gave me an anti-depressant and no stabilizer (like Lithium), which gave me what? Panic attacks. See, it's like a club. You went from MDD (net says major depressive disorder), to anxiety and panic to schizophrenia and now Bipolar 2. ""I don’t understand various diagnosis.""

As i said before: They know what you think, see the mental pictures u create in your own mind, physically feel what youre feeling and even see what youre doing LIVE. Just look up all the ""claires"" on youtube or read a book about it if you dont believe me. Almost ALL people know about this(families friends strangers) they have just kept this a secret from us since we are strong broadcasters. We think more with the ""neo cortex"" which is the outer part and the most recent part of the brain, whereas most people think more with the reptilian part of the brain(greed, power, territorial thinking), hence the term ""REPTILIANS"". Also something i did not mention which is very important, is that they have learned, from a very young age how to control their ASTRAL BODY(look it up, if u havent heard about it), invisibility is REA
L! Weve been conditioned to think(since we were kids) that invisibilty , telepathy, teleportation and what not are some mystic super powers but they are in fact as real as it get. You might ask, how do you know all this? Its because during my ""psychosis"" i became one of them. Even my FACE(my eyebrows went up almost to my hairline) and body formation changed, i was so fascinated by this and stared at the mirror for many many minutes if not an hour or more, had no concept of time. The voices said to me youve exposed the ""hybrid race"". They told me that we are both. Both reptilians and oridnary humans. I had a full COMPLETE psychosis. Thats why i physically changed and opened up all the ""claires"". Most people dont have a full psychosis, they get to the part of hearin voices and then goes in to psychiatric care and then it stops for most. That why i feel psychologically lonely, have noone to talk about this, even with other schizos. They can relate to mind reading and thats about it. Its very very hard to b

This man has been harassing me since 2018 and I have letters, physical proof, and text messages from him so I know atleast for myself that this is no delusion as my medical records would likely lead them to believe if viewed. I eventually snapped one night when he wouldnt take no for an answer and forced a flower in my face and sent angry hand written letters to my coworker that defended me. So I went to the police and they had me wait in a room for about 20 minutes and came back in and basically had a we dont believe you attitude. So I’m looking back and wondering if they have the ability to view my diagnosis list and discriminated against me due to it? In the end all they did was tell him not to talk to me. And hes been finding ways to get under my skin ever since."

175946425,"The original discussion has to do with this group of men hating all women because they feel rejected. Looks matter to many, that’s true. But being venomous to all of the opposite sex due to not getting laid and indoctrination of young people is the problem."

174339139,"I get this kind of thing all the time. It’s a common symptom of schizophrenia. Clattering dishes, fan noise, mumbling voices, these are all avenues of hearing hallucinations for me."
175946427,I heard voices as a kid but not a ton. I just remember thinking about the voices i just heard but no one was around so i was confused. I never saw any psych dr as a kid but was diagnosed w autism and sza in my early 20s
175946428,There is also a shortage of high quality competent therapists. Most of them are subpar.
175946429,she’s currently waiting for an ambulance at the hospital how can i support her? she’ll likely end up in the same psych ward where I am
175946430,I used to egg peoples houses when I was a kid or put fireworks beside their house. Some kids put fireworks in peoples mailboxes (That shouldn't be done cuz pets). I was chased by cop cars like 10-15 times. Never got caught. I remember hiding behind the wall while the cop came close and then walked away. We loved the adrenaline rushes. Fireworks were illegal in Ireland. People would smuggle them from the north. Innocent times =]
175946431,Don’t drink on meds.

175946433,"Well, it’s why there are laws against incest. I don’t know specifically what incest does between first cousins but it’s generally frowned upon and taboo in almost every culture on earth. In earlier times, in England around the 16th or 17th century, it was common for the royal family to interbreed and those unions produced some pretty messed up people. And so you had rulers in England who had all this power to head a country but they had some weird and dangerous flaws."

175946441,You just want to tell them to stay out of your face. It’s all neediness of some kind.
175946442,Of course. I had added drama with things like erotomania. Postitive symptoms still. I used to love more before the psychosis but I think a lot of that was erotomania. I got into a lot of fantasy relationships over normal ones. Meds really sorted that out for me!
175946443,"have you ever tried standing up to the voices, calling them names and telling them f you. Thats what i do and they back off for a while.

175946445,"I have an autoimmune disease that affects my lungs and many other parts of my body. My issues are many but I always put my health side. I used to talk to a therapist years ago but that was when my family was still around. They think I’m a hypochondriac even though it was tests that diagnosed my immune disease. I stopped driving because of loss of vision in one eye. It’s not safe to take the dogs for a walk in my neighborhood. So unless my husband takes me somewhere, I sit at home. I really don’t mind my home being my world. It’s when my husband becomes a part of that world. He doesn’t care what I say. He claims he does and when I tell him to prove it, I get no response. He basically treats me like he did his mom when she was alive. I would love to be a part of a therapy group but I use oxygen and having a third party drive me places scares me that I might run out of oxygen before I can get a ride home. As for meds for the depression. I was given some and it immediately made me suicidal so 
I won’t take them. I feel strongly about not literally taking my own life, but I still wonder if I just stop taking the meds that have me stable in my disease, that I could progress and not suffer. Thank you for responding."
175946446,I was pretty sure I had some sort of apotheosis for quite a while. That died down though.
175946447,"You could be dependent like me though maybe because of the antipsychotics + stopping 60mg of Vyvanse at once is a hard hit mentally to the mind. I wouldn't say you're addicted because you take it every day as prescribed. You don't have to completely stop the stimulant if you're having psychosis - You could maybe try lowering the dose to 50mg for 2 weeks (The amount of time that it takes to withdraw from a stimulant) and see if your psychosis gets better. I was treated for ADHD/hypersomnia and schizophrenia at the same time - I guess the psychiatrists just want me to be happy cuz antipsychotics on their own really suck from the fatigue. Either stimulants don't give me psychosis because I'm different or it's because of the antipsychotics (I've never taken a stimulant before without being on an antipsychotic so I don't know what that is like). Lowering the stimulant would be an option if antipsychotics don't work idk - Cuz then that would give hope for them to work. My new psychiatrist said that I wou
ld do well on just clozapine so if my psychosis ever gets worse, that's what will happen. Vyvanse is in a trial (Not sure if it failed) for treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia."
175946448,It’s the isolation that causes the most problems. Humans are social animals and the modern world is very self centered and lack of social outlets really take their toll.
175946449,"_PERSON_, how do you find competitions to give your stories a winning shot?"
175946450,"Thanks for letting me know that this is common enough to at least have a name. Sometimes this disease makes me feel like I am the only one who has my problems, but knowing that others have had the same experience helps. Sorry if that sounds self centered, but sometimes I think I have to be in order to be accepted by others. In case you haven’t’ noticed, being self centered is the new norm. Or maybe I have been isolated for too long. I was in a program that our local DHS has 3 days a week. I know it don’t seem like much, but it helped me with my delusions. Anyway, sorry if I rambled on, just haven’t had anyone to talk to for a long time. God bless and stay safe"

174339143,"I have schizoaffective/depressive type. I take a antipsychotic and two antidepressants, seem to make me functional enough But I have a flat affect (no expression on my face) and get those bugged out eyes that a lot of people associate with the insane. I really hate the bugged out eye look and lack of expression, I can't control it, my ID looks scary. Al though I may be seemingly normal on medications I guess my facial expression and lack of it, keep me from making friends. I ruminate a lot about anything if I miss a dose of medications, where I have ""crazy laughs"" out loud without realizing it cause I'm so lost in my head, I heard my downstairs neighbor mocking my ""crazy laugh"" once, my house gets messy and it's hard for me to get out of my head, sometimes even on medications, especially if I drink too much coffee, but I drink a lot to counteract the extreme apathy and lack of motivation I have. I don't experience voices/hallucinations at first going off medications, it has to be completely out 
of my system before I experience psychosis. Last time I went several weeks off my medications and would feel someone kicking me even though I lived alone, and fake mocking fart sounds coming from my butt even though I wasn't actually farting. Before I started antipsychotics, I would have mostly visual hallucinations some voice but mostly seeing things, or hearing footsteps and door slamming, mocking like things mostly or really dark images, or people following me from dreams, not sure if they were real people or not, but they looked real. I get major depression off medications. So the key thing is to stay on medications. I would feel fine and try to go off numerous times and it never worked out well for me."
175946455,"I’ve noticed certain things can increase my hallucinations (like voices). 1 is too much nicotine and I start to hear things 2 is coffee, too much of that and I will hear things and get racing thoughts and 3rd is if I drink red wine frequently I will start hearing voices again… that’s all I’ve noticed so far so have cut back on those things quite a bit."
175946456,"Since I got my libido back. Once every week if we can. Before my sex life went to hell, but so far so good. Also imagining myself with _PERSON_ from Rammstein helps me get in the mood. I have a huuuuuuge crush on him. I love me some German"

That was when I had to commit to staying on top of my treatment, because I knew I would keep hurting people if I kept quitting my meds.

175946466,"Hey guys, need some input for a friend. Backstory- friends daughter has developed a lot of strong tics after being put on zoloft. First 25 mg, then 50, tics got to 160+ a day. Took off zoloft 11 days ago, tics did not go away. Today she has a tic attack. They just would not stop and the girl (15 yrs old) could not function or talk. Had to go to the ER. At the ER they gave her Ativan in case of seizures, then 2 separate shots of 2.5 mg Haldol to stop the tics as much as possible. My question is what type of side effects did you experience on Haldol? Not sure if they are going to make Haldol a prescription for her or not, but her mom is worried about side effects. I told her you guys would be great informants. Thanks ahead of time for your help."

I usually go to two support groups a week, hang out with friends most other evenings, play indoor soccer, and get together for lunch/dinner with friends.

I also have a lot of fear/shame around my diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and sometimes still just don’t feel so great."
175946475,I remember one time I was off meds I felt better than I do now. But then again everyone was concerned about me and I had zero control over my emotions back then. It just sucks when both options are bad. The decision to be on meds sucks. And the decision to be off of them sucks too.

174339153,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Neurocognitive variability in schizophrenia spectrum disorders: relationship to real-world functioning. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research. Cognition, Jun 2020 Neurocognitive variability exists within the schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) population, with subgroups performing at the same level as healthy samples Here we study the relationship between different levels of neurocognitive responding and real-world functioning. The participants were 291 SSD patients and 302 healthy controls that were assessed with a comprehensive neurocognitive battery. In addition, the patients were assessed with the Specific Level of Functioning Scale (SLOF). The results showed that the mean neurocognitive test responses of the SSD group were significantly below that of the control group. However, there was considerable overlap between the cognitive scores of the two groups, with as many as 24% of the patients performing above the mean healthy score for some domains. 
Moreover, the patients with the highest level of neurocognitive functioning reached the highest levels of practical and work-related functioning outcome skills. There was no significant relationship between neurocognitive and social function skills. The large differences in cognitive performance and their associations with functional outcome within the patient group are rarely addressed in clinical practice, but indicate a clear need for individualized treatment of SSD. Early identification of cognitive risk factors for poor real-life functional outcome is necessary in order to alert the clinical and rehabilitation services about patients in need of extra care."

I’ve had my GP (PCP) gloss over important details or not bother with things. She’s nice, I like her but sometimes if I don’t prod her with questions she tends not to be the best doctor I’ve ever had. I got an advocate through my nephews company of all things. His company gives him the use of a health advocate for free to any family member. I had problems with my kidney and needed tests done. My PCP referred me to Stanford Hospital (a prestigious hospital) and I called them and they told me I couldn’t get an appointment until my doctor faxed my medical records to them. She made a mistake and the print in the fax was too small to read. This was back in March. _PERSON_ told me to have her fax new documents but there was delays and mistakes and incompetency and laziness and I made a couple dozen calls to get the matter straightened out but the prob
lems just went on and on. The advocate stepped in and talked to my sisters and then me for information and called my doctor and she put pressure on her to do her job and soon I had my appointment though this was not until September, seven months after I was first referred. It should have taken a month. Me and the advocate are on good terms and have exchanged many e-mails and not only is she always ready to step in if someone jerks me around but we talk about how we’re doing and small chit-chat."

175946536,"Yes, I agree. Not to mention the fact that this article never states how it defines “recovery” or “minor psychotic symptoms.” Is it being determined by the patients? Because what I describe as having “minor” symptoms is a day where my symptoms are more organized in the sense that my mind isn’t chaotic, even though the symptoms that I have left over would likely still result in doctors putting me on AP’s. And who determines whether or not someone is having psychosis? Because if someone is living in a non-bizarre delusion that could be taking place, it might not look like psychosis. Like someone who maybe believes that his upstairs neighbor stomps around the house in the middle of the night because they’re jealous of his garage parking spot. Is it a delusion? Possibly, but at the same time, there really are people who are that petty."

When I came out of my room, my mom looked at me with a stern face and said, “Come here.” I came near her feeling scared. Then, my mom said “I heard everything you just said. Why do you want to talk about your illness?” At that moment, I just froze still. “I didn’t talk about my illness.” I said to her. She told me that she heard everything and told me to stop lying. My brother chimed in and asked a few more questions about who I was talking to. I tried to tell them that they are my “gaming friends” and we all had “struggles” to talk about. Basically, I lied about everyone in that vc room having schizophrenia or some psychotic disorder. She told me to never do it again. If she catches me talkint about MI or my physical disability, she will forbid me from talking to anyone. She told me that “illness is nothing to be proud of” and that “no one wants to listen to your 
problems”. She was worried that people in that vc room are going to make fun of me because I have sz/MD and no one is going to take me seriously. She also told me that it’s “shameful”. My mom doesn’t know that I am part of an online forum for people with sz. She doesn’t like me interacting with other people with sz. My body is also failing and no one is listening to my cries at home. I feel completely alone and I want to keep being on this Discord. I just hope that the Heavens would have mercy on me.

I’ve been trying since June to get this squared away with nothing but bureaucracy in my way every step of the way and I’m finally in the home stretch and now my old pdoc cuts me off. What am I supposed to do? Go cold turkey off my ap? Jesus. How is it beneficial to anyone to cut sza’s off their antipsychotics?

The cognitive therapy approach might indicate your thinking is distorted in worrying too much about your PCa, for example, as I understand it (my father survived worse, and my PSA has shot up enough that I'm about to get a 4Kscore), Gleason 3+4 is not good, but not terrible. Although the treatment options are not fun. oceanfisher58 said... The biggest cause of my anxiety is my father in law honestly. Having him intrude on both myself and my wife non stop.... My question about that mess is why does it make you feel specifically anxious? Strong negative feelings are expected and completely normal, but based on my very limited understanding of all this (my anxiety and depression are probably more genetic than is typical) I don't see how this results in anxiety, unless you're repressing your anger about it. Which in a different type of situation w
as in part a trigger that pushed me over the edge to chronic anxiety. So trying therapist guided CBT and/or reading the book based on it and anxiety might help a lot."

You think that you’re better than those of us who’ve had violent symptoms just because you’ve never had violent symptoms? Let me tell you, having these violent urges is not fun. It’s terrifying, actually, hearing these voices, having these urges, looking back and realizing how close you were to becoming a murderer. It’s people like you who cause people to end up reaching their breaking points because they don’t feel comfortable asking for help about matters relating to violence. And yes, I’ve read the thread about that man and his dog, and I think that nearly everyone who replied to him was being an ass hole to him too.

175946655,I was on Tegretol for decades. Minimal side effects but it could interact with Risperdal. It reduces the effectiveness of risperidone. Tegretol interacts with lots of different meds. Periodic blood tests are required for Tegretol. This means you would probably need to be on an increased amount of risperidone while taking Tegretol.
175946656,did you try ejuicedeals i think that still ships to newyork
175946657,I tried getting it but I couldn’t amma try again this year the test they give is not enough too a certain that you need ssi they make you count backwards from 100 by 7 and ask you to remember 3 things you would have to have dementia to fail it horribly
175946658,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo
u’re just daydreaming to observers."
175946659,I get it worse when I nap. Scary stuff.
175946660,"Thanks, it’s common sense."

175946662,"Not really, I’m socially anxious and quite shy"
175946663,"Wikipedia: “Regions implicated in anhedonia include the prefrontal cortex as a whole, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the striatum, _USER_ID_, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area (VTA).” Its too complicated to treat. I need a brain transplant."

175946665,"Same me too. I was super into it when I first got it, but this past couple of weeks with the new pokemon and these indie games I found, its amazing!"
175946666,I’m struggling with this among other things right now. I don’t have any fixed view on it no matter what I read about or stories you hear. Is there a particular reason you’re worried? I wouldn’t worry until something gives a reason to go through the worry. Last I went to the ER they told me I had masses on my kidneys and I have not felt the same since. They acted like it was going to be lethal. Either way my stress levels have exceeded far beyond my means of coping how I usually cope. Never experienced a complete break before but have had a breakdown. Isn’t it great facing the uncertainty of such a thing? Lol. Nope. Never heard anyone say that.
174339193,For me I probably would have been on a lower dose of AP had I not tried to go off completely....like maybe 2.5mg...I was stable on that a long time. Sometimes low is better than zero.
175946667,"Lol, yes, I am curious too."
175946668,I’m paranoid now because I remember when I think I heard an angel telling me to stop drinking. I think the angel wanted me to die so those things with North Korea wouldn’t happen. I didn’t listen so now worry I’m screwed.
175946669,I cant read either I have never been able to truly understand or comprehend books very well especially non fiction I just dont see a point to be honest I read fiction but not from books but I also have dyslexia so that may be it
175946670,"I started Classic WoW when it launched with a rogue, got in a guild, got a core hound tooth, then my guild cut half the rogues before I could get my Perdition’s Blade so I quit the game entirely. I’m playing Sea of Thieves and Magic the Gathering: Arena lately. I’m doing pretty well with my blue/red deck. I don’t get as much enjoyment out of them as I used to but they are still my main hobby and I still get a certain level of enjoyment from it."
175270561,"I am still here even though it's taken me some time to post. Another day stuck at home. I am going to venture out shopping tomorrow. Walmart is asking the healthy people on Tuesdays to not shop from 6am-7am so elderly & immune compromised people have this time to shop & stay safe from Covid 19. Also on Wednesdays Target will also do the same. I hope when I go this week one store has TP. This makes me feel a bit better since I am unemployed. Still HUGE frustration over the idiot generation that thinks they don't have to obey rules and in their selfishness they get someone like me (Diabetes and Asthma) sick with the virus!!! My mild cognitive impairment has changed me to be much less tolerant to stupid people. Yes, I'll say it; that generation deserves to get the virus. Glad to see all beaches closed."
174339189,"I haven’t been on here in awhile. I’ve been doing good the last 9 months. I got on Abilify shot and my symptoms went down. Ive just been ignoring everything about it though and its catching up with me. I get random memories that I don’t know if they really happened. In my head, the things I think happened look/feel like stuff thats confirmed that happened. If that makes sense. I haven’t been going to cousensling. Which I should probably do. Maybe that’d help work this stuff out. My voices creep in with my delusions and I’m trying really hard to ignore it. But it’s hard when you so desparetly want to believe it. LIke one part of my mind says its not real but another part, a big old part of me, secretly believes in it. Sorry for the rant to get more on point, does anyone have similar memory problems?"
175946671,"The lessons learned were valuable I lost everyone though Friends and all siblings. All that’s left is my father and I don’t trust even him. These people will not talk to me, I’ve apologized and tried to explain that I was in a state of delusion, but they don’t care. I need a job, I’m 23, I should be working. I need to fix my life up. I’m ashamed and my self esteem is at a new low. How do you get the courage up to get out there? I’m basically broken. GD."
175946672,"Oh, I knew moods were involved, but didn’t connect the differences."
175946673,Don’t go getting steamy romance novels! My husband teases me if he sees something questionable come through his Amazon account. I use his account for my Kindle Unlimited.
174339198,"I came from a middle-class family. (maybe a little lower actually). We didn’t have a lot of extra money but we never went hungry and all of us kids had nice clothes for school and we had a nice car and enough money to buy a few luxuries or catch a movie or go places often. We were comfortable. I grew up in a nice city and most of our family friends were very well off but we always had enough money to go anyplace we were invited. I got sick at age 19 and ended up in the psyche ward in 1980. Through the '80’s I lived in nice places and group homes and some that were not so nice. I ended up in a kind of average hospital for 8 months and I was a kind of naïve 20 year old thrown in with hoods and street people and some dangerous people and more weird people than I can count. I got out and I got a job and I’ve worked at many unskilled jobs since the hospital but they bought me good food, music (Vinyl, then cassettes, and eventually CD’s). My department stores jobs paid for gas for my car and ste
reos, books, and other things. I enrolled myself in college around 1985 taking one or two classes at a time. I had gotten SSDI (disability) in 1983 or 1984 but I worked part-time steadily. And this middle-class guy ended up addicted to crack and poor and sick. But I took any job that was offered. There are few jobs that I snub or look down on. My dad instilled in me a liking for physical jobs so that’s what I did for years. But the only reason I wrote this post is to make a comment. You may end up successful but there’s also a chance you may not. You may have no choice about going on disability. There’s no shame in getting disability. Social Security was put in place for very good reasons and people from all walks of life may end up on it. Aiming for the stars is great, you are blessed with intelligence and it’s fair to use it to the utmost advantage. But many people before you have had to give up dreams because of the realities of living with schizophrenia. I try not to post negatively but look where 
I came from but now I’m working as a janitor. It’s an honest job and I am happy with the pay and the people I work with and happy being around the office workers that inhabit the office building I go to work at three days a week. Life is funny with it’s ups and downs but I feel extremely lucky that I work at all. I don’t what path your life may take you down but if you succeed you can be an inspiration to other people. Despite the illness you can carve out a niche in life and even though you have schizophrenia you still have some power, some control and you still have choices. I guess I rambled but I wish you luck and maybe this helped in some way."
175946674,I found it easier to come of diazepam than gabapentin. Nb: I take pregabalin now. I find it useful
175946675,If you are not harming yourself or others its ok. Some of your posts seem a bit dramatic so it can be tricky to tell over text if you need help or not. When i was delusional i was much too consumed by it to share it with anyone online So atleast your coherent and acknowledge somethings up

175946681,"I live in a apartment building and often when I say hi to neighbours the only response I get is silence. I’m really only on good terms with my next door neighbour. It’s like they can smell something is wrong with me and they tell me that I’m not worth knowing. At least that’s what it feels like. I just find it a bit strange, I mean it’s common courtesy to respond when someone says hello. I gotta admit it’s starting to get to me. It’s a bad feeling when you give and get nothing back. Lately I have stopped saying hello to anyone except my next door neighbour. I tried to say hello to someone today, but got nothing. Anybody else feel like they get treated like this?"

175946723,"During this last 12 month period, I have personally noticed an increase within my own symptoms of 'voices' being ever more *****y and facetious. In accordance with what is best described as subvocalized live streaming, in addition to public gaslighting campaigns and the unnerving suspicion of a smear campaign via smartphone apps. I have noticed a sharp increase with confirmation from contact within a few organizations stating that they have had a number of phone calls from bewildered parents stating that their children have suddenly started to change and experience hearing of 'voices' upon a daily basis, most of the children were between 12 and 14 years of age, I enquired as to if the the staff at the centre noticed a sudden change in the normal admittance levels and age ranges during the pandemic. Would this be true of other voice hearers, would during lockdown you notice more of them, meaning different 'voices' as well as the volume level of them, so sometimes you would hear them as a whisper and 
sometimes they would be like normal conversation level. Also when I was diagnosed you had to be in your mid-teens or late twenties, not 12 or 50 and wake up one morning to experience full-blown voice to skull. Would any of you ever thought that location or being isolated within one localised space has something to do with the whole experience/reality of this would location play a role within being a VH/EH. Would love to hear back from any of you with regards to your thoughts."

It’s like my brain is tired and I get intrusive symptoms as a result or I get really blocked in thinking or focusing. It feels like dopamine being too low if that makes sense… But then if I get too much of a high sometimes then it’s almost like positive symptoms coming back (luckily not enough of a high). Like I get a bit too much dopamine then. Or so it feels to me. But my issue is more the brain exhaustion, than too high dopamine, really. Does this make sense?"

175946770,Like so many other times since he had worked there the all too lonely man met the young woman who was almost 20 years his junior. Almost every other time she had talked about her boyfriend or fiancee’ but lately things had changed. Her marriage had been postponed. Today she didn’t talk the usual talk. She spoke of friendship cards involving people becoming “more than friends.” Sadly he shook in his shoes because he could do nothing about it. So that evening she went home into the arms of a new lover and he went home to his Mom’s house after she picked him up where he prepared a meal for himself (his Mom rarely cooked for him now because of her aging so tonight he did it himself.) He also did the dishes and vacuumed the house thinking ever the more “I’ve got to get out of here” even though he knew society may frown on him leaving his Mother. Any love affair could not happen without her permission because she had the car and the shelter. All she ever said about it was “You can have a 
girlfriend but you’ll have to ride the bus.” He knew one day the last hope would likely come and go. Little did he know that at 40 it had. Even though he’d escape he wouldn’t go far. His last hope would move on like many before her into the shadows of life never to return.
175946771,I’m glad the meds got the bullying voices under control for you-- have you switched meds since the type of voice has changed? That’s something I worry about-- the voices changing and getting to the point where it’s full-blown all the time. Hope you are well

175946772,Your right _AT_MENTION_ sorry I didn’t mean it to sound naive
175946773,_AT_MENTION_ OK guys its oficial I’m commiting spiritual celebesy rn. Good god guys has everything been so obscure lately?
175946774,"During the Cold War we had 25,000 nuclear warheads, and the Soviet Union had 30,000. Some scientists were telling us that if we just used five percent of these weapons it would wipe out all life on earth. Today both the U.S. and Russia have around 7,000 nuclear warheads, 2,000 of which are actionable. That is still plenty to destroy all civilization, and probably all humanity. I was looking at a piece on the internet that was saying that if just Pakistan and India got into a nuclear war, and used a few hundred nuclear weapons, it would change the climate enough that a few billion people would die. Personally, if I had to bet my survival and the survival of my friends and family, I would bet on the old doctrine of “mutually assured destruction”. If both sides know that if they ever used nuclear weapons they would be totally destroyed it would be an irrefutable disincentive to nuclear war. The best way to guarantee this nuclear disincentive is through the use of nuclear missile firing submarines. 
If some air force officer gets an alarm that the other side has launched its land based missiles, that officer is still going to hesitate, and make damn sure the warning is correct before he launches the missiles he’s in charge of, because he knows the nuclear missile firing subs on both sides are invulnerable, and it is impossible to stop them from launching their missiles. This scenario has played out before. As perverse as it might seem, it is best to follow the ancient _NAME_ dictum - “If you want peace, prepare for war”."
175946775,then you don’t have to worry about it anymore… i’d listen to your pdoc… or do you really think it’s important to be diagnosed with OCD too for getting better?

174339226,"The article is 12 years old. So nothing came from it I guess. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The antipsychotic potential of l-stepholidine--a naturally occurring dopamine receptor D1 agonist and D2 antagonist. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychopharmacology, Aug 2008 l-Stepholidine, a dopamine D(2) antagonist with D(1) agonist activity, should in theory control psychosis and treat cognitive symptoms by enhancing cortical dopamine transmission. Though several articles describe its impact on the dopamine system, it has not been systematically evaluated and compared to available antipsychotics.We examined its in vitro interaction with dopamine D(2) and D(1) receptors and compared its in vivo pharmacokinetic profile to haloperidol (typical) and clozapine (atypical) in animal models predictive of antipsychotic activity.In vitro, l-stepholidine showed significant activity on dopamine receptors, and in vivo, l-stepholidine demonstrated a dose-dependent stria
tal receptor occupancy (RO) at D(1) and D(2) receptors (D(1) 9-77%, 0.3-30 mg/kg; D(2) 44-94%, 1-30 mg/kg), though it showed a rather rapid decline of D(2) occupancy related to its quick elimination. In tests of antipsychotic efficacy, it was effective in reducing amphetamine- and phencyclidine-induced locomotion as well as conditioned avoidance response, whereas catalepsy and prolactin elevation, the main side effects, appeared only at high D(2)RO (>80%). This preferential therapeutic profile was supported by a preferential immediate early gene (Fos) induction in the nucleus accumbens over dorsolateral striatum. We confirmed its D(1) agonism in vitro, and then using D(2) receptor, knockout mice showed that l-stepholidine shows D(1) agonism in the therapeutic dose range.Thus, l-stepholidine shows efficacy like an ""atypical"" antipsychotic in traditional animal models predictive of antipsychotic activity and shows in vitro and in vivo D(1) agonism, and, if its rapid elimination does not limit its actions, it 
could provide a unique therapeutic approach to schizophrenia."

175946829,"More than a year ago I was at work and a group of office workers were standing a few feet away from chatting. I overheard one of the guys said something about a vacation in Mexico and I couldn’t resist so I said one of my stock jokes that i have on hand for just this situation. I get to use this joke about every four or five months. The guy was talking about Mexican candy for some reason, so I chimed in and I said, “Of course in Mexico, they just call it “candy”.” It’s an old joke I heard years ago. The whole group paused for a second and then burst out laughing and I walked away feeling pleased with myself. That was about a year and a half ago. Well, I don’t see the guy much who was talking about Mexico but when I see him occasionally he always says, “Got any jokes today?”. It’s weird because he sounds just a little sarcastic and even a little mad. And he does this every time. I’ve told him a couple jokes and we make small talk and he seems friendly but my original joke must 
have offended him in some way and it’s a year and a half later and he’s still mad about it. People are funny."

175946886,That’s interesting how Apathy can cause that. I would try to get rid of it as soon as possible. Do you feel like this around your friends or family?

175946890,"We were 21 living with our 2 year old and my husband in military housing. We were always out with friends, drinking, going to clubs and trying to make our way in the world. We went to stay with my parents when my husband got deployed to Iraq. We were saving for a brand new bed and enough money to pay for when he got back. We then moved back to where we were stationed and we started having issues, or I was, at that time I was fixing to have my first psychotic break since getting married. It went on for years, and then I got pregnant with our second child and the biggest psychotic break happened, which was my second break. I became combative, stressed, angry because I couldn’t figure out what was wrong. I stopped talking to my friends, isolated us and held my husband hostage. The military got involved and they told me to leave so my husband could focus on work. I went to stay with my cousin for about 2 months, and was scheduled to be induced. My husband got to come see me and come get us and take u
s back home. His _PERSON_ was down his throat about him leaving me because I was clearly “crazy”. Who says that?!!! He tried to separate us because he thought what my problem was domestic. When in reality I was sick and becoming more and more sick. Don’t ever rely on the military to help with Mental health, because they didn’t pick up on my sickness, they tried to push us to divorce. Horrible, horrible experience! Anyway, that’s what was going on 9-10 years ago. Glad that’s over."

I wish _NAME_ was real, I really do. Failing that, public assistance may be able to provide you with a free or reduced fee lawyer for this. I had to get one last year when food stamps denied my yearly recertification (DUE TO THEIR MISTAKE ) Securing the layer really wasn't that hard. Once you get Social Security or SNAP benefits, you are entitled to a lot of perks such as reduced utility rates. I get Amazon Prime for half price because I have a SNAP card."

She wont be helped."

Should I run away or suffer and tough it out and have thoughts become worse because someone is making it worse, like today I wanted to leave but I had to help people at my volunteer place. And my thoughts were sad and pathetic. People yelling at me saying they wanted me dead."
175946898,"Consider what happen if you have emotions? You might get irritable, angry and even violent if got bad emotions. Depressed thoughts might even lead to self murder. So this lack of emotions is a protective mechanism either by the mind or due to the medication to feel at least to not react to negative things."
175946899,there’s a great woman on Facebook that I follow she makes videos about Your Inner Critic and how to live with or without it. I don’t think she’s ever said perfectionist though. hope you don’t mean serious harm. for me it’s more like discipline.

175946902,Honestly besides hearing the voices I’m just a regular guy. I’ve never thought the government was out to get me or that my thoughts were being broadcasted or that I was a famous actor. Does believing the voices are real even really count as a delusion because technically it is because the voices are probably just created by my mind but any person without sz if they heard voices there’s a good chance they would think it’s a spirit too without have their D2 receptors causing this false belief

The depression and anxiety is so off the charts for me. I’ve been having panic attacks everyday and they come out of nowhere. I fear I’m sick every minute. And it’s bad enough having fear of being sick, whatever the phobia is called. Many people I know through online means are extremely sui. I’m tired, you guys. Emotionally. I’m so tired..."
174339236,"I was in denial the first psychotic episode…I said, “I just had a nervous breakdown” and went without my meds and got a job while semi stable still for two months at a design firm away from my original job being a residential designer…long story short I finally became totally psychotic again and the company took me by _NAME_ to the hospital for observation and then I was put in a mental ward…sad thing is, I didn’t have insurance so they prescribed me some meds but I never got them filled and my room mates thought they could just let me stay insane while I lived there…this went on in a horrific belief system about the devil and Jesus was saving me for helping him come back to earth by sounding the chant, “eho yeshua holy yahweh”…long story short again…I finally got put in the state hospital and they kept me until I stabilized this time…never again would I go off my AP. never again."

My labs are good, which I knew because I got a copy of the results, except that my A1C went to a 5.8 which I am not happy about. She just said stay away from sweets. I don't eat tons of sweets but I can cut out the cookies from my lunch and things like that. The one thing is that I like soda too much. I don't think I can give that up. But liver, kidneys, cholesterol, glucose was all good. And best thing is that I got my asthma inhaler refilled. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't have to go to urgent care now."

Now i’m back on Abilify 10 mg + Olanzapine 2,5 for sleep and at bit of Mirtazapine and now i feel a whole lot better."
175946919,"That’s what the therapist said. She said I was stressed being in her office, nurse said that too. She said no med is going to make everything go away. But being that stressed it was like two days before it started and I started not to be able to feel a connection with people or make eye contact, got the shot and I was settled again. So that’s why I went to get it early cause I felt like something was off and I was irritable"

I think there’s just one dominate thing that exists throughout space and time making it easier for them to live in this world. If there is no point to life than there is no saying normal people’s plots are valid. They don’t even know what they are they are the mindless zombies and I don’t want to be one of them. I don’t want to be normal to be sucked into the mundane trance of a creature bigger than your perceptions. I just hate that nothing makes sense nothing I do nothing they do nothing. I don’t know what the point is anymore why can’t the point be to see what my voices are showing me maybe they are right and everyone else is wrong

I don’t have any problems, two weeks ago, I guess, my muscle in the cheeks stopped hurting. I put that one on smoking because I always smoke on the right cheek side. But it is fully gone the pain from it. I have no reasons to keep my teeth’s and take care about them, maybe I’m foolish because too young and no consequences."

175946953,You ok daze? I’m just _NAME_ with the punches.
175946954,Yeah it does that. Granted ive gotta have 12 hours sleep on it. Ive been on it over 8 years as well - so ive probably got a tolerance to it. And i dont work. A couple of large filter coffees helps in the morning - when you get hungover on it.

She’s been trying to put me down as having DID and it’s just not so. And I’m sure the past 7 or so doctors and 15 or so hospital discharge papers, that diagnosed me as having schizophrenia, would disagree with her, heavily.

175946967,"Broadly I have done pretty much all the things you discuss. It happened in 2004 when I was 16/17 and then again when I was 25/26 I ended up in France (I am in England) as I was riding trains trying to escape my hallucinations. One time I got to Heathrow airport in London and tried to board a flight to NYC USA, but I was arrested before I could by a ticket. I had a delusion where the red, white and blue flags of the USA, Britain and France had some special meaning in that it was a tri-state psychic protective liberal estate that we lived in and NYC, Paris and London held special ritual value to the protection of us from the rest of the world. It sounds kinda weird, but also scary that the ??????? colours of flags could make me think all these fantastical things. I have not thought about this kinda stuff for a long time. As far as I am concerned I am recovered in that this doesn’t happen, but I still need to get more social. I just got diagnosed with Autism at 32, and I hate it so much. I wish some

If you find these thoughts come more and more often , and for longer periods of time then I’d worry. A brief flicker of ‘madness’ can be seen as divine light. To live your life with this completely will make people see you in the light of madness. I’d say you were delusional. You came up with philosophical theories to prove your case, which you seem to be unable to disprove or get others to disprove. It is not ‘normal’ to think this way, so beware of your own sanity. Just continue to function in normal society because that is what really counts…As long as you can do that then if you have bizarre thoughts then so what!?!

And when I test her urine, it's always high in glucose even though I'm giving her the insulin. I'm not sure if the cat litter has something to do with that chemical wise, because she goes in the cat litter then I put the stick on top of it, so I'm not sure I'm getting a pure sample.

175947011,When I had psychosis I would go a week at a time without sleep. The hallucinations were so bad my mind couldn’t shut down to sleep. I hate having to take my medication because it makes me sleep 12 hours. I sleep 12 hours then usually I stay up for as long as I can 18-24 hours before I take my medication again. One day I wake up at 8 am the next day I wake up at 8 pm. If I don’t sleep 12 hours it’s hard to fight the sedation. I have to drink pots of coffee to stay awake or I’m miserable.

175947048,"So, you say you were raised in a negative environment. I was too. You said, “I mean things that have happened to me make me more scare of the same situations again.” I’ve never experienced that, so I don’t know anything about it. Are you able to deal with that, or is that the main problem? The reason I mentioned your sensitivity and femininity is that it sounds like when you get attacked, you want to hurt yourself. When guys get attacked, they want to strike out, and get angry, which is equally bad I would think. As a fem, when you get attacked, you want to hurt yourself. But you didn’t do anything. Are you thinking it’s your fault? As mentioned earlier here: 1. Sometimes fear is a warning. It’s like someone putting a hand on your shoulder and saying Go No Farther. (From: _NAME_ Rice, Memnoch the Devil) 2. Fear doesn’t shut you down; it wakes you up. – _NAME_, Divergent 3. At the end of the day, you’re entitled to every one of your feelings. Don’t allow anyone to belittle you 
for your sensitivity. Vulnerability does not make us weak; it makes us human. — _NAME_, To Anyone Who’s Afraid Of Being Vulnerable So I think it’s quite natural to, “Once burned, twice cautious.” It’s human nature to run as fast away from harm as possible. So, I don’t know about that part. Maybe you have some ideas. As for my own experiences, some of them were good and some of them were bad. Some of the good ones helped me get through. One of the good ones was, I was at an Al-Anon meeting, for friends or relatives of alcoholics. It was a small group. When it came my turn to speak, I listed my troubles in a sorrowful voice. The woman next to be listened patiently and when I was finally finished, looked up at me and said, “Oh, you were having a Pity Party, we’ve all done that.” There is embarrassed, and then there is embarrassed to tears in front of a group. It was embarrassing but it was true, and the woman was looking right at me. It was a strange combination of messages from her and emoti
ons inside me. I could tell she was trying to help, she was a female and her eyes and tone of voice conveyed sincerely wanting to help, and her words carried two messages: “You were feeling sorry for yourself” but she also said, “We’ve all done that” as in welcome to the human race. Since she was a female, I let her meaning seep into my psychic, get past my guard. I didn’t disagree with her. I let it sink it. Years of my mother, who was sexually abused, tying to keep me beneath her by encouraging me to be weak and feel sorry for myself, were washed away in two sentences in about two seconds. My mother was bad luck, and she had some of her own, and this woman was good luck. After that, I never felt sorry for myself again. For every time I tried, I saw that woman’s face, and I heard her voice, and it didn’t work. My Pity Party couldn’t get started."

174339266,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are two major neurodevelopmental disorders that differ in their age of onset and clinical profile. ASD and schizophrenia are characterized by varying degrees of brain dysfunction associated with behavioral abnormalities and differences in clinical outcomes. The causes of both disorders are unknown, but it is well recognized that their etiopathogenetic mechanisms involve an interaction between a strong genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. This combination then leads to epigenetic changes of gene expression and subsequent neuronal alterations responsible for synaptic plasticity and additional synapse formation. Additional pathogenetic mechanisms involve dysregulation of the immune system and brain-gut axis dysfunctions. Brain function analysis showed that individuals with ASD and schizophrenia have alterations in _USER_ID_ and glutamatergic transmission. GammaAminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate represent the major inhibitory and excitato
ry neurotransmitters in the brain, respectively. Preclinical and clinical studies have been investigating how an imbalance between the inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) neurotransmissions during early phases of neurodevelopment may be useful in discovering novel molecular targets for potential drug therapy. Current treatments for both ASD and schizophrenia include antipsychotic medications such as risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, and aripiprazole, which target specific neurotransmitter receptors of the dopamine and serotonin systems. Despite the genetic vulnerability associated with ASD and schizophrenia, and the response (full or partial) to antipsychotic medications, treatments are still needed that can address the molecular mechanisms of the disorders in order to improve long-term overall health and quality of life. Recently, an emphasis has been put on environmental modifiable risk factors, including nutrition status and dietary patterns, which can play a role in disease prevention, treatmen
t, and managing symptoms. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337499259_Functional_Food_and_Nutrition_for_the_Management_of_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_and_Schizophrenia MatriscianoandPinna_BookChapter.pdf (1.0 MB)"

175947078,"Individuals with psychosis are at an increased risk of victimization. Processing of facial expressions has been suggested to be associated with victimization in this patient group. Especially processing of angry expressions may be relevant in the context of victimization. Therefore, differences in brain activation and connectivity between victimized and nonvictimized patients during processing of angry faces were investigated. Thirty-nine patients, of whom nineteen had experienced threats, assaults, or sexual violence in the past 5 years, underwent fMRI scanning, during which they viewed angry and neutral facial expressions. Using general linear model (GLM) analyses, generalized psychophysiological (gPPI) analysis and independent component analyses (ICA) differences in brain activation and connectivity between groups in response to angry faces were investigated. Whereas differences in regional brain activation GLM and gPPI analyses yielded no differences between groups, ICA revealed more deactivati
on of the sensorimotor network in victimized participants. Deactivation of the sensorimotor network in response to angry faces in victimized patients, might indicate a freeze reaction to threatening stimuli, previously observed in traumatized individuals. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-019-0082-z?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=organic&utm_campaign=NPJS_2_mp_NPJs_USG_SCHZ_organic_twitter"

Wow I have exactly what u have u described it perfectly i needed u when I went to see my neuro ophthalmologist lol low lighting or not I see it too once a dr told me that I'm very hyper aware of my vision cuz of what I see so maybe it is normal lol idk I dont remember see ing at all before Interesting enough I've been told I'm hyperaware of things too. I also have anxiety/depression too from tinnitus/hyperacusis that I think also played a role in making me more hyperactive to things and noticing these things. I can also see the white blood cells in my eyes, well used too (I don't look for it anymore), and my doctor thought I was very hyper aware of things. Perhaps it's a combination of something slightly off in the processing of our brain, sprinkled with some sort of hyper awareness to things. I'm a very in tuned person to emotions. Just in my nature. I REALLY feel sadness, or joy, or anger, if that makes sense. Things affect me deeply. I think that has a role on my body, how it re
acts and how I then notice and focus on it. While I still fully see it, and even the last day or two I felt like I've been seeing it more gaming/watching some movies, I do know I've felt better when I truly step away from it and don't focus on it. That takes a long time for me to get to that point, but it definitely helped. If I stop seeing it as a threat, even if it's there, the brain does a decent job of filtering our attention away from it. 12345"

174339270,"Taboo is not the word I would use. Painful is what I would use. My brother who was severely mentally ill committed suicide when he was 30 28 years ago. He was 1 year older than me. I am a Christian and I do not believe “Suicide means you are going to Hell”. Most commit suicide because they are suffering mentally and/or physically. They do not choose to be born with either of these ailments and God will not punish them further. The Morality of suicide is a nonentity To me. My Opinion and My opinion only based on my experience. My Brother had severe schizophrenia the worst of all mental diseases in my opinion full onset by 20. Never got the right medicine and only had one good psychiatrist that passed early in my Brother’s diagnosis & treatment. I knew from the moment he was honorably discharged from military with it, he would kill himself. It was just a matter of time. He attempted it about a year after he was diagnosed but denied it. I was on watch from that point on. After he committed suici
de I wondered how he lasted so long. I know why as I got older. It was Love for his family. It outweighed his pain until my aging parents finally had to have him hospitalized long term. After 4 months, he came home and I think he said To himself he was not ever going back. As he stopped taking meds sometime after that, he killed himself. Frankly he never really took his meds on a regular basis (the biggest problem). For him, as you say his pain was over but for us, it just continues. So while not taboo in my opinion, it is painful and the aftermath is brutal. My Mom grieved so hard she eventually got cancer. She could tell you how many days he had been gone. Most folks count years but she could give you the days and hours. That was the level of her grief. We often wonder if he had the right med, the right psychiatrist , the right therapist, the right therapy, the right support group and if A slight gap Of time had not been left from when my sister left and my Mother got home, he would still be here. Could he 
have had a functioning life today? I do not know but there would be Hope that he could especially with all the changes in meds or At least I hope so for schizophrenia. He was/is still loved like so many who have committed suicide or contemplating it. I will not tell you to think of your loved one’s pain but to think of yourself. Is it possible to have a better life? Are you taking your meds as prescribed? Do you have the right combination of meds? Are you self medicating with alcohol or drugs? Do you have a support group or someone you can call in the dire moments? If you are doing all that and still in the midst of a painful prolonged mental crisis, you are in pain. And in my opinion it is painful. So I do not consider Suicide taboo or endorse it. The morality of it is between the person considering it and God/whatever religion or not. The Morality of it is a non entity in my opinion. What I do know is that It is Painful for the victim(people who commit suicide because of mental illnesses are victims) and 
their love ones. Just my opinion and a good topic. Thanks!"

175947125,You can develop good habits and promote rewiring. For example you can remain busy and manually focus away from depressing thoughts. When you follow this pattern for some days depressing thoughts become less and less interesting to pay attention to. On the other hand if remain idle and pay attention to depressing thoughts it become more and more interesting to pay attention to.

174339277,"Speaking of psychiatrists, I see my psychiatrist on the 5th of July. I haven't seen her in like 10 months. She's a really nice psychiatrist. Caring, empathetic, understanding.. I'm gonna ask her to lower my Invega injection from 150mg to 100mg cuz I have ZERO positive symptoms. When I take THC, I have a few positive symptoms but it doesn't last. I completely go back to normal after a few hours. I don't know what else to tell her. Maybe that I'm dealing with negative symptoms but I probably just have to learn how to fix that on my own because my psychiatrist I'm sure can't do anything about it. Other than that, I'm doing good. I'm on 5 meds and they work. I used to be on just the Invega injection and yeah.. Great that I was only on one med but I was suffering greatly.. It's ok to be on a couple meds which is what I need to function.."

174339294,"Thank you so much, Breaking Dawn! Well, I don’t know what will happen but am hoping for the best. I am sorry but need to vent now! I am overweight and disillusioned living with my parents. They are not supportive about my goals and intentions. I have become sick of them and am looking forward to leaving here. They won’t allow me to go outside their house to exercise or anything. It is bs if you ask me. They are embarrassed by me. I had enough of their crap. My mother wants me to stay home to help her. As if she can’t do anything! She is taking advantage of me!! Argh!! She drives and goes everywhere on her own. She won’t allow me to drive and she is asking me to live for her!! I am bloated now due to her emotional abuse. I am super happy to be leaving!! I want to slam the door in her face but will go quietly. I am glad to have this opportunity to leave!! She is very paranoid saying I will die from this corona virus. The rate I am going, I am going to die from being overweight!! She makes no 
sense at all. She does whatever she wants then tells me that I can’t do what I want. She is a pain in the rear end. I am very sad that I allowed her to control me like a dog but this is it!! I am leaving!! Thank you very much!! I want to say to her face. I am so unhappy that dying is better than staying here. I don’t believe I will die from the corona virus. I will be ok. However, my mother is so paranoid and evil in her mind, she probably wants me to die helping her. She is unstable in the mind. She shouts most of the time and is angry about everything in life. Listening to her is like listening to a deranged individual who never stops complaining about everything. Geez!! I wonder how I survived for so long with her. I am very angry with her as you can tell and am really relieved that although the situation is not ideal to be able to leave for good and never return here. I want to work and make ends meet. I will try to build my stamina and also incrementally take on more work responsibility. I also want 
to exercise!! The simple things in life I took for granted before are so important to me now!! I will be gone in a week from here. I thank my blessings!! I am stable and need to receive my monthly shots and hopefully I can arrange this over there. I believe, I will be able to do this. My shots are my lifeline. I don’t take anything for granted anymore!! Thank you, God, for my life and the opportunity to live again!"

She is super unfair, you didn’t decide to live, it was her choice to bring you to this world(and your father). What I’m trying to say is that you don’t have to bother what she suffers with you, you didn’t choose to be ill. As for your ptsd, you did your best at therapy and had to relive all those traumatic events, which makes you very brave. I’m not a therapist but you should value your will to recover, try make your mom see that. You know you have value and you live in a tough culture, it’s hard being a korean in korea these days, there’s a lot of pressures on your society which might not help you on your path to recovery but don’t give up!

175947223,That’s great you’re improving!
175947224,"I'm not a professional, but I've noticed the brain and body do things to protect us. Good that you're listening to yourself and dealing with what comes up instead of trying to push through by pretending you're ok with continuing therapy with her at those times. The likely reason that you're held back is to prevent any increase in the feelings of vulnerability right now. Taking time to deal with the things mentioned builds rapport and allows whatever is coming up for you to settle a bit before going forwards. Expressing needs = vulnerability Vulnerability = for some, isolation ""expiriencing the pain that has been there inside, before that i didn't feel anything"" ^ = emotional (and maybe to the point of physical) discomfort = rawness + feelings of vulnerability + body may feel like it's in danger or under threat All of this can lead to a higher degree of reactivity to people and things around you. Along with an intensified experience of emotions. ^ = possibly more extreme behaviors. For me, this wa
s where learning coping skills and grounding skills and all that was important. ^ It continues building a rapport/trust with the therapist - without the overwhelming level of vulnerability you described. And teaches how to come out of that intensity and discomfort you just described. Yeah, being too vulnerable makes me freeze and lose visual focus where I'm not blind but I can't focus on anything around me, and I stop hearing what the person is saying. ^ Then it can shift to me fully leaving my body and/or into different forms of psychosis with different durations. Going slow, not forcing yourself to trust and not forcing yourself open up more that you can handle is important. Equally important, is learning what works to bring yourself back to a more comfortable baseline if I do push myself too far. Progress can come with discomfort at first - most new things are uncomfortable for a while until you adapt to a new baseline. Especially when trauma is involved. It sounds like you're working hard and change is ha
ppening. The body language and exposure to rage sounds like it's causing a fight/flight/freeze reaction. That survival reaction naturally overpowers the more rational part of the brain, but once the rational part of the brain assesses that there is no danger, it sends signals to the body that it's safe and the person normalizes. When you have trauma, the survival reaction is a bit haywire and hyper-responsive. As a response, it's also more deeply ingrained than the rational part of the brain hence the freezing due to movements and not being able to force yourself out of it. I say this a lot, but EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) therapy can really help break up the emotional intensity that causes you to freeze/fight/flight."

174339304,"Hello, I have Paranoid Schizophrenia and I am having bouts of severe depression. Today I also had suicidal thoughts. I am currently in a day clinic, which means I sleep at home, and I am taking 10mg of Olanzapine every day. Me and my psychiatrists are in the process of switching to Clozapine. One of the doctors said that the target dose should be 300mg of Clozapine. Is there any chance that Clozapine will take this depression away? I functioned really well on Quetiapine and I worked while on it, but it failed to remove my positive symptoms completely, and I was taking high doses of it(1600mg/day). I believe Olanzapine is causing my depression and making me very tired."

I can sympathise, smoking does apparently give a testosterone boost or stability (and I’d say I agree). Anything that spikes heart rate or pressure generally means you’re alert and aware. When there comes a time when you can be “manly” without it, it’s definitely worth leaving behind though. But yeah, it’s upto you how you live your life.

175947291,"I think that IF it were a bioweapon it would be very unlikely to be Chinese because it binds to a gene which is especially prevalent among Chinese and other East Asians. There is the possibility that they were trying to make a cure (for SARS) and it is known that the lab in Wuhan was working on such a project (search for “Will SARS come back”) and then released it accidentally but why then did it associate people who were in the market? So how did it get to the market in Wuhan, where almost all of the first patients were reported? Random natural evolution that just happens to be near Chinese biolab? (This is the non conspiracy theory) Bioweapon / Virus Lab worker spreads virus to market (This is the blame the Chinese conspiracy theory) Planted in Wuhan market to make it look like them weird bat-eating virus-making Chinese did it (This is the “blame China’s enemies”, conspiracy theory.) The Chinese planted it in the Wuhan market to make it look like someone had planted it on them!? (This i
s a bit too far fetched to me but conceivable. ) There is a big split between rich and poor in China. I visited Dairen Foreign Language University in China recently and even the split between the (compared to Wuhan’s lab, low tech) foreign language campus and the fishing village in front was big enough that I am willing to bet that I am the only person that frequented the fisherman’s cafe and the university. Even the students were not in that pre-modern (?) part of the town, much less the suited and manicured professors.The same is true here in Japan actually. I have never seen a colleague down at the fishing village purchasing live fish, only in purchasing fish in processed packs from supermarkets in the city. It seems unlikely to me that a high-tech laboratory scientist would be purchasing their dinner at that wet market, let alone accidentally drop a vial there or sell a lab animal as food to the market – these ideas seem to me to be absurd, but they could be plausible to those who see all Chinese as 
foreign and strange. Chinese lab workers are very modern imho."

I have been around enough schizophrenics lately to notice that when they are heavily hallucinating they are talking out loud and it can be a little disturbing even to me. I also would like to note that for many years I would fail to look directly at a woman and that would actually turn them off. I still have trouble with that one.

174339344,I think it’s based loosely on ECT. I don’t think it’s effective for SZ but I could be wrong. Don’t know how effective it is for depression.
175947336,Pretty much the opposite of an opiate !! Lol. But yeah I understand the confusion. I got it prescribed for alcoholism. First it drastically cut down my drinking. Then after since I started zoloft. It combines with the naltrexone to reduce cravings even more. I’ve probably drank about 6 1/2 total beers in the total of 2 years I’ve been on both Zoloft and naltrexone. But it’s had other effects. I’ve been really lucky. My insight used to be The pits!!! For many years!!! But quitting alcohol and taking meds has drastically improved my insight and moreso each day.
175947337,"PTSD from sexual abuse at age 4,then beat by kids at school, got sz diagnosed after a reaction to anesthesia from surgery, woke up to voices, hallucinations, lasted to current times. Doctor did surgery in office, he died during lawsuit from state for almost killing another kid. They gave me 4 bags of anesthesia to a 50lb kid because I didn’t go under. That right there is ptsd ???? too, physically deformed me and mentally ?????? me up. I was 11. I’m sure other abuse later in life would have triggered the sz, but that’s how they said it came about. Drugs, but not my choice. My mom was 25, did what was suggested by the doctor for treatment for surgery. I wish I could get revenge on doctor, but alas, his time was up."

175947386,I self-neglect. Though I do try to look well-groomed at the moment and try to work on things. For me it is a bit of both. Some things I don’t see. Some things I don’t have the energy/motivation/oversight for. The biggest reason of all though: i spend a HUGE chunk of my time on things other people don’t spend time on. This time I can’t use for self-care-activities. Because I’m busy. With regulating my emotions. Curbing paranoid thoughts. Building basic social or living skills other people mastered before age 13. Making sense of the world and other people. Sometimes I spend a whole day on getting rid of my anxiety and making sure it doesn’t get out of control. Other people then complain “but you had a whole day to clean your house!”. But actually… I didnt. I was very very busy not collapsing. For this reason I think we shouldn’t be too harsh on ourselves. We actually have a whole lot of extra tasks that other people don’t even see! Does that make sense? Are you okay with self-car

I just really can’t stand this. Every time when I tell them that I’ve made some money they need to know how much I’ve made and they always question my skills and what I do. And it’s not only this.

It’s like I wanna lose the weight and I know that I can lose it but I just lack motivation and I think that I just eat more because I’m depressed and all of what they say irritates me.

Some would say that I don’t have sz, but that it was purely drug-induced. Others say that cannabis “brought out” the sz that was already there. Who knows? To be beaten, are you asking if it can be “cured?”"

In some countries they have even tested providing a “living wage” as in just giving everyone enough money to live every year regardless if they are working or not. They get insurance whether working or not. They are encouraged to take vacations from work when needed. Extra methods are taken to make sure people at jobs are treated well. The fixation on work work work until you die and not want to do anything else and just go ahead and die if you can’t because then you’re a drain on society is such a cruel, awful idea."

175947479,"It coincided with a very large and public psychotic break at age 9, so I’ve always assumed they were connected and that it’s genetic. I began hallucinating at age 6, but 80% of my positive symptoms are pleasant so I wasn’t worried about reproducing. Unfortunately, theirs are very scary and takes a turn for the paranoia. My younger child was once delirious at age 9 (but from a fever) and I panicked—big time. It was almost to the day the same age as the older one. But, the fever broke and all went back to normal. that that one remains “typical”. But the child with the decline has been heartbreaking to watch. They used to perform several grade levels ahead/interested in quantum mechanics (yeah—before 9) and now struggles to find someone’s age if given their birthday. That kind of thing. The other kid is still not psychotic, seems emotionally healthy (aside from PTSD from family mental health stuff, but is in counseling), and is performing a few grade levels ahead. it stays that way for 
this one."

175947525,"There are a small portion of people who have recovered and then come off their meds. The truth is you might be recovering from the disorder apart from the meds… that is, beneath all the treatment, you are recovering. Theoretically if you had recovered enough, you could come off meds and stay stable. However the problem with this is that your body is so used to the medications that withdrawal can be horrible. Also, there’s a good chance you haven’t recovered enough to be off of them. A good portion of schizophrenics will never recover enough to be off them. Now that I’ve said the theoretical stuff I’ll tell you the experience based stuff… every single time I’ve tried to come off my AP, I’ve lost touch with reality in some way. I wouldn’t call it delusional thinking, but more of a general dissociation that scares the crap out of me. Once it landed me in the hospital. I wouldn’t recommend it unless your doctor is okay with it and you are monitored very closely and ready to go right 
back on them when the crap hits the fan, which it most likely will. I know it’s easy to say stay on meds for life but some of these meds do things to you over time, like me and my akathisia. I pace nervously often because of my antipsychotic. When I’m off the antipsychotic, I can sit still, but again, I can’t risk relapse. I might try to talk my doctor into it after I’ve moved and am in a low stress environment."

I think I believe we live on some how hopefully in a loving good happy peaceful way to be who we are.

If you call something crazy it is an insult in my eyes to people who have to deal with any mental disorder, especially schizophrenia. There is still more _USER_ID_ around it and other disorders that may not be as common, and it puts makes a lot of people homeless. Mental disorders and drugs can consume someone. I know for me I used illegal ones to cope with the disorder at some point. I wasn't sure how else to deal with it and people around me had a hard time affording appropriate _NAME_ care."

174339396,"I recently had a hospital stay for schizoaffective disdorder, bipolar type I. Today marks the beginning of a really good and quiet and calm place for me. All I did was organize the space around me, buy some things that I actually needed plus a haircut, and decide what I should do with the amount of time I spend at home. Some of it is play because I've never been playful before. Another thing is that I don't have a mouth for many complaints, negativity, or just plain hatred/bitterness. I still lack some social skills though and hope PsychCentral can help with that. I hope to use the computer more efficiently because I would love to be knowledgeable about them in the future. I am a millennial and I know computers really are probably never going out of style. Society is just going to get used to them in the future because they are easy to use and work better in multiple job settings. Plus, entertainment. I am also doing things I didn't do before because I was not realizing that it was too important to 
miss. I am making plans about this part of getting more out-in-the-world. I enjoy consciously and willfully understanding and performing a task to achieve a good end now. Before it was like sometimes I would just dawdle. Well, more like all the time. Not even playfully. I guess that it means I interpreted correctly some, let's say, signs from the universe and that I should just let go of some baggage I carry from memories or regrets.

And just because it is OTC doesn't mean that it is necessarily safe to take. Depends what meds you're on and stuff. Or what dosages. I remember going to the pharmacy to get some meds for my sister OTC when she was pregnant. She had the flu really bad but the pharmacist was like, she can't take anything. I'm like, dude she's in a bad way. So I had to call her and find out how many weeks she was and everything before he would recommend anything. Finally he did. But sometimes you gotta be careful.

I never had any attachment to those medications, just the opposite: I engaged in several confrontations to the point of it being settled in a more let's just say formal setting to hold those morons accountable so I could finally get off of all of that worthless crap. I was contesting several erroneous things along with those medications, and I did prove that those things were indeed erroneous. Abilify gave more than one person I know terrible akathisia. Why is akathisia not listed as a known serious side effect of anti psychotics? Oh right, people would be less inclined to take them without question. I'm not saying don't take medications if you need them, by the way. I have zero personal vendetta against medications. They can and do help a myriad of people all the time. What I'm saying is that people should be informed of any and all possible side effects so they can make an informed decision about what they 
choose to take or not take. I've never had anxiety or panic attacks. I've never been fearful in general, which has lead me to being quite reckless. Why in the hell do so many psychiatrists feel the need to call everything ""anxiety"" and ""depression"" when it's so obviously something else?"

174339412,"My face movements are now becoming more common. I don’t want to be on a clozapine, though I’m worried my doctor wants to switch me from quetiapine, which already has a low risk in causing eps. My face is rigid, and if I flex the muscles around my nose, they squeeze. My doctor ordered benztropine. I read in a study which I found online that anticholinergic drugs, like benztropine, don’t help. I’ve had high doses of aps for 3 years before being tapered off. The eps may be from those cumulative elevated doses, rather than me currently reverting to quetiapine. I have been able to manage having been tapered off them, and feel mood stabilizers at higher or more therapeutic doses might really help me. I’ll just have to wait and see what he thinks. Much of my struggle stems from my withdrawal from lorazepam last year. Right now I’m not as sharp as I’d like to be. I’m also having a mood episode, and I think that even simply treating that would be me getting significantly better. Those ideas 
point toward mood stabilizers, like the depakote and lamictal, or lithium. Maybe lithium can help me fall asleep. I’m not too enthusiastic about the idea of clozapine. I want to reduce atypical antipsychotics and remain taking mood stabilizers so my brain can heal from lorazepam withdrawal Generally; Think about; -avoiding clozapine, -tapering off of quetiapine, -lithium and lamotrigine (yes) -continuing divalproex and lamotrigine. (Yes)"

175947699,"They give some kids with ADHD Adderal, which is a stimulant, and it helps them, but I would be very careful with the uppers if I were you. The bad part comes when you’re coming off them. One time when I was in high school I took ten white crosses, and I thought that was a lot. I told a girl I had taken these pills, and she, “Uh, oh yow, I can remember when I could get off on ten white crosses, but that was a long time ago.” Still, coming off those white crosses was miserable. I was really sleepy and really tired, and I could not go to sleep. I got sleepy when I stood up, and I was wide awake when I laid down. The uppers can take you to some pretty strange places. There is the term “amphetamine psychosis”, which you can get if you take more uppers than you’re used to."

I'm feeling depressed and all these emotions of sorrenduring into the unknown. Eventually something really bad will happen to me, and I'll go back to that place of the bad trip..

175947720,"That’s an example of indirect influence. If your voices are constantly calling you a piece of shít, there’s nothing wrong with then deciding to work on your self esteem. That’s not the same thing as arguing with them and trying to get them to stop, yelling that they’re wrong. They’re not sentient; they’re the product of your own mind. Trying to force them to stop is like trying to force yourself not to think at all. It won’t work because it’s unconscious and involuntary. You’re telling your mind to stop thinking, and all that does is make you more aware of your thoughts. Same with voices. It’s an involuntary process. You can’t influence it, so you may as well stop trying and do your best to live the same way you’d live if you never heard any voices at all."

175947723,"I had to call 811 (_NAME_ Health Link) this past Monday. Took me 20 minutes to get a nurse. Used to take under a minute, pre-COVID. When I finally got the nurse, she be like: “Why didn’t you call 911 for an ambulance? You have chest pain and and shortness of breath.” Yes, well, those are also COVID symptoms now and we’ve been explicitly instructed NOT to call 911 for COVID symptoms or to go directly to a hospital with them. Their messaging isn’t exactly great here. I was told by one nurse with knowledge of the operation that they’re partly overwhelmed with calls from seniors who are lonely because they can’t visit in coffee shops, salons, and grocery stores now. That’s frustrating because it’s not a mental health line or chat line. COVID is degrading all kinds of services."

174339426,I remember in 2nd grade they took me out of the class and said I was going to a room for “special kids” because I didn’t talk much. Probably some autism or learning disabled class but I sometimes feel and hope it was for smart kids. We didn’t do ???? but they singled me out and we would do games and crap. I had behavioral issues but was told I was good and had potential with computers. Never figured out what that was and I sometimes think it was some sort of experiment given my beliefs and research into conspiracy theories. I loved private school. It seems all my problems stem from going to public schools.

175947745,"Hi, I'm also bipolar, though I tend to sit on the depressive side with more hypomania than full blown mania (which I rarely experience). What you are saying definitely sounds bipolar, though I'm no expert. I too deal with suicidal/self harm thoughts on a regular basis (4 -7 days a week when in a depressive state and 1-2 days a week when hypo/manic). I would definitely suggest talking to a psychiatrist about your symptoms -- especially if they are interfering with your daily life. Also, Mental Health America does offer a pretty good free screening for bipolar online. Here is the link: https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/bipolar?show=1. That might give you something to go off of before paying to see a doctor. Good luck with everything."

175947755,"IDK. Doctors go through more schooling to get to where they are. To be in their position you have know a whole lot more crap then a nurse does. But I see your point, it’s just one of the inequalities of life. It’s just kinda the same with teachers. Many, many people besides themselves would tell you that they are overworked and underpaid. And under-appreciated. Also, the doctor has more responsibility and more is expected from them than nurses.

175947805,"The truth is, a lot of delusional people get on this level. It usually happens when you feel connected to everything, and then try to make sense of it. Feelings of being good and bad usually are heightened by whatever you are paying attention to. Watch a scary movie, you’re satan, watch a heroic movie, or a sermon about Jesus, you’re God, or Jesus. Here’s the facts: The Christian version of “satan” is stolen from Pagan concepts, they just kept the Hebrew word, HaSatan. meaning “adversary,” or “enemy”. Jews don’t even believe in Hell, another pagan deity and location. Like Hades, not even Jewish meanings. Another thing, Jesus’ name means “God is salvation”, so when people are told to “believe in his name”, it’s not about being Jesus, it’s about knowing that salvation only comes from God. Schizophrenics seem to suffer a lot due to religious brainwashing. You are only “satan” if you are “against people”. So, technically, being homicidal is very “Satany”. T
ypically, it’s because people want the title, do they go off and do stupid sh/t in his name. The TRUTH is, Satan works for God, has no throne, has no realm of “hell”, he’s just an angel (meaning, NOT YOU), in service to God. Imagine what it would be like if I came up to a group of Native Americans, and was like “I am the White Buffalo Calf Woman”. Well, that’s impossible, I’m not even a woman, or a buffalo, or a shapeshifter. I am The _NAME_, I should know."

175947809,Today i saw Footprints Where i followed To see Where I’m going Where i came from Where this rugged Path would lead Stumbling Wondering Who walked ahead If they had Good intentions Or one to bring me My final breath Oddly I felt no fear Maybe More like resignation Not knowing Not caring Its like No one could stop Me from Falling So why Wouldn’t i accept This fate Why would it matter I’m stuck in the same place Feet moving Never getting Closer But i feel like I’m almost there Don’t speak to me I only understand The voice inside I push on Longer than my feet Can take Its a 50 year journey When will it end

But I also said coincidences are more inevitable as the world becomes more complex. I also said the sz mind is very complex so it notices the coincidences more. I also said coincidences are proof of god regardless of my complexity theory. So the more complex the universe becomes, the more god will show itself. This on smaller or bigger scales. It doesn’t matter. The chaos rules continue to apply no matter the size of the system. Whether it be your own sz mind. Or this sz world. As it becomes more complex, coincidences are more inevitable.

I am smart and have a lot of potential but have extremely low self esteem, I’m lazy, and other schizophrenic stuff.

175947853,"I utilized the school psychologist in high school which was the only way I made it thru those 3 1/2 years. He helped me get clothes when I needed them, and a winter coat the one year. He also didn’t call psych to pick me up when I showed him what I did to myself and the time I’d taken bottles of OTC tylenol to kill myself at school. He made me sit in his office until I threw them up. He also helped me thru the three miscarriages in high school _NAME_ and I had. But the two I saw years later after having the three kids and in SD, they were useless. But who I see here now for last 2 years, she is great. She and I talk like friends, we aren’t doing coping stuff unless I specifically ask for suggestions for a situation. We’ve talked about some of my past traumas from childhood, as a dating teen, becoming head of house at 16 for my mom and sisters. But she doesn’t blow smoke up my ass or do the whole gold star for you type therapy. It’s, do you feel like it was you or death for your family? 
I of course say yes, I mean, it literally was. She says I just proved to those around me that I was better than those who abused me in the past, because I still showed humanity even though those several people took it away from me. I like my talk therapist, and she’s the one who goes to bat with finding me different doctors for my conditions by who her patients have had good, healthy physical and mental help with problems. Like I got into pain management in April! The guy that her patients recommendd quit in December, so reception just told everyone no bookings till July minimum. I called Thursday, they have a new doctor starting April 1st, I see him the 8th. 90 minute trip one way, but I’m one of his first pain management patients as he is a fresh young doctor, lol.

175947893,It’s worth it to take medicine to get unstuck from a major depressive episode in my opinion. But I believe it’s a chemical imbalance causing it so it stands to reason that you would need meds to fix it. Some people believe otherwise. I guess you have to decide what you think is causing your depression and if you think meds will help. If they will then take a lot of them and get rid of it once and for all.

It would be immoral not to oppose such horrible actions. However, that said, there is a quote by _PERSON_ appropriate here - “When opposing monsters take care that you don’t become a monster yourself, and if you gaze long enough into the abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.” I think I got that quote close to right.

175947901,"Modafinil is useful. Impact of Modafinil on Prefrontal Executive Function in Schizophrenia https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.2006._PHONE_NO_ These data demonstrate that modafinil increases dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during the purposeful modulation of motor activity in time by people with schizophrenia. We have shown that where baseline prefrontal function is worse (as measured by letter fluency performance), increasing left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex activation predicts improving cognitive control of motor activity (expanding the response space on a second executive task known to implicate left prefrontal cortex). This model is able to explain most of the variance (54%) in cognitive control that we observed. Clinically, these data suggest that modafinil is a cognitive restorer in some, improving cognitive control in relatively poor performers of these executive tasks."

It wasn’t until the spring/summer of last year that not only was I accepting of myself, but also wanted to be more open with others. And now, my high school knows, my family knows, and my friends know. I even gave a speech about my schizophrenia in speech class in front of the whole class, including people I used to have delusions about. I did it to reduce _USER_ID_ and also for myself to reassure my positive attitude about this destructive illness."

Olanzapine can be used as an appetite stimulant, and when I’m on it, boy can I eat! So you aren’t alone; I think most of us have been there."

175947918,"The problem isn’t you, it’s your society. You as a person are not unwanted, but your society looks down upon those who are not healthy. Your family loves you, and you are not a burden to them despite what they tell you. You have friends here who love you. We all need you alive. I’ve lost friends to suicide before, and losing a friend or family member to that is the worst feeling in the world. If you don’t want to be a burden, don’t burden anyone with the grief, anger and self-blame that comes with a suicide. It’s a wound that never quite heals. Keep being yourself. You are smart, kind, funny, and creative. And those are four very important values, at least to me. And never be afraid to message me if you need a talk, even though I know I’m horribly slow at replying sometimes. Hugs"

175947921,"Yes it does, to watch the move _PERSON_ it took me 4 days to watch it. Because before the movie was made, I told my pdoc that I like to make people laugh and he said can you make money out of it. He made sense though, then I was thinking to be a stand up comedian but for that I needed common sense or so called the funny bone. Anyways we need to face the fear with meds as one would come out of fear. Example: I attended about 65 interviews in span of 3 months to land a job and gave up trying. Funny thing is I got a job when I did not try for it, I said to self, let me accompany my cousin for an interview and there I was selected. We need to get over the fear. I am not letting you know you have to face all movies but take it slow if you wanna watch it."

175947929,Sorry to hear about your ordeal. I do encourage you to keep on hoping. My mother told me about child abuse in the family a couple of years ago and I was devastated. My sibling seems to be doing well professionally and I’ve tried to understand her more. I do see a therapist and actually spoke to the therapist yesterday. I mostly focus on confessions/worries but I think it would be a good idea to talk about my negative experiences that triggered my voices with her. You make a good point and I guess I should go into a similar environment or not let the experience block my goals or plans. A kind of exposure therapy. I’ll ask my therapist if this is a good idea in our next session. As they say hope deferred makes the heart sick but a longing fulfilled is a spring of life. Currently I get great comfort from my bedroom and do not have a stable job.

174339476,"according to the records my doctor provided me at my last visit. The reason for my diagnosis was because I had paranoia that my family was out to get me and that I was also being poisoned by medication. Now let me clarify. Was my family out to get me? long story short, yes. My mother has been micro managing me my whole life. My older siblings have their own selfish interests at heart and would rather keep me silenced as to not cause a disturbance in their lives. I did not believe my family was poisoning me as the records indicate. That was a false claim made to get me admitted into the hospital. My diagnosis is just simply schizophrenia. I was a young teenager with depression and anxiety in school at the time. I feel like medication should be a last resort for angry outbursts because they can stem from depression and circumstantial matters, which if looked into why I was having angry outbursts I feel I would not have been diagnosed with this illness. I simply was struggling with my family conflicts 
and manipulation from my mother and siblings. to sum up, I have never had visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, delusions, or extreme paranoia that was not rooted in reality."

175948006,"The Recovery Expert – 24 Oct 15 What is Trauma Bonding? One thing often asked by those in the helping profession when confronted with a person in an unhealthy relationship is, ""Why do you stay?"" This question has implications of weakness and fail One thing often asked by those in the helping profession when confronted with a person in an unhealthy relationship is, “Why do you stay?” This question has implications of weakness and failure on the part of the victim and usually causes shame. Rather than asking this question of a victim of abuse, it is best for a counselor to understand the concept of trauma bonding, and explain it to the individual who seems “stuck” in a bad relationship. Trauma bonding is loyalty to a person who is destructive. While the idea of bonding tends to bring up connotations of something good and beneficial, trauma bonds are unhealthy. According to _NAME_, in his book, Betrayal Bonds , there are a number of signs that a person is involved in an unhealthy bond with 
a partner or other significant person. Here are some thoughts to consider determining if you are in a trauma bond with someone: There is a constant pattern of nonperformance , yet you continue to believe promises to the contrary. Others seem disturbed by something that has happened to you or was said to you, and you are not. You feel stuck because the other person keeps doing destructive things, but you believe there is nothing you can do about it. You try to change the person into becoming less destructive by trying to get them to stop an addiction or become a non-abuser. You keep having repetitive, damaging fights with this person that nobody wins. You seem unable to detach from someone even though you can’t trust them or really don’t even like them. When you try to leave this person you find yourself missing them to the point of longing that is so awfu l that you believe it is going to destroy you. Usually trauma bonds occur in relationships involving inconsistent reinforcement , such as those with add
icts and alcoholics or in domestic violence situations. Dysfunctional marriages also cause trauma bonds because there is always a time when things seem to be “normal.” Other types of relationships involving trauma bonds include cult-like religious organizations, kidnapping and hostage situations, those involving child abuse or incest, and unhealthy work environments. The environment necessary to create a trauma bond involves intensity, complexity, inconsistency, and a promise . Victims stay because they are holding on to that elusive “promise” or hope. There is always manipulation involved. Victims are prey to the manipulation because they are willing to tolerate anything for the payoff, which is that elusive promise and ever present hope for fulfillment of some deeply personal need within the victim. So often, those in a traumatic relationship are “looking right at it, but can’t see it.” Only after time away from the unhealthy attachment can a person begin to see the destruction it caused. In e
ssence, people need to “detox” from trauma bonds by breaking them and staying away from the relationship."
175948007,"All kinds of stuff about the world not being real, or me being in Purgatory or them being helpful. Telling me to do certain things or not do certain things and a bunch of crap I don’t want to hear, mainly about the afterlife. All appealing to weak points I have and trying to get me to play along. I stopped playing along a few years back now when I hear the voice I just interrupt it and tell it to shut the ???? up. I wish it would stop though, it’s so hard to sleep with a voice insulting you. There’s nothing I can do about the insults. They probably stopped trying to lead me down rabbit holes because I stopped believing them, who knows."

This was also right around the time I had to switch to a new pdoc that the state assigned me, she didn’t prescribe anything to replace the Loxapine except gave me sleeping pills to help with my insomnia. So my paranoia and voices have been bad again, I’m wondering what else I could take to supplement Geodon that would help with this? And I can’t take Haldol I don’t react well to it."

175948047,"I may be dismissed by my employer soon. Today, while talking it out, one of the people involved in the decision explained that he has known me now for 2 years but he and others find it frustrating that they know nothing about me. He talked about my reservation and emotional detachment, and a respect for the independence and curiosity for the enigma but wishes that I'd allow people to get to know me better. He's said today in _NAME_ terms that people have explained to him that though they find me approachable, they feel like, because I'm perceived as bright, listen to others talk about themselves without disclosing anything much about myself, people feel the imbalance and I suppose don't feel good not knowing whether I want to be their ""friend."" This isn't new and doesn't take me by surprise. It's something I've identified and have had mentioned to me in past relationships. However, it was refreshing to hear it again as probably a reminder. What struck me more is his probing on my self-isolation. 
He asked fairly direct questions about who I feel close to and whether I even feel the need for closeness. He disclosed some personal details about having isolated himself and bottled up feelings before having a breakdown and recommended that I might try, even if I don't feel like I need it, allowing an easing of burden by talking to others. It was a good chat with fair advice and observations, though my first instinct is that I just don't connect in the way that is being talked about. His challenge to me however is that I possibly am just unaware of that feeling. He also mentioned that my not giving of much away makes it hard for people who don't have contact with me (especially, since people who do struggle too) to discern whether I was acting in self-interested malice or made a mistake. There's clear utility there in disclosure. The thing is, I'm comfortable disclosing when asked. I just don't forward information unless it has obvious use. A lot to digest today-- Which is odd, considering this is all stuff 
I've gone over before. I think the way he put it to me solidified aspects of the thinking though in a way that I find difficult to shrug off."

175948058,I’m not sure. It always seems to have bad news
175948059,explain why my delusions started at age 11 then and lasted for years?? and why a doc called me psychotic based on my behavior (i wasnt violent or anything) and recommended me to go on APs months before I was diagnosed with psychosis NOS
175948060,Yeah I know that song lol. _PERSON_ and _NAME_ made the original
175948061,Idk… It’s hard to tell especially since I’m not a pdoc They see patients every day and probably spot patterns of what is true psychosis and what isn’t? Good lucks… You’ll be fine hopefully

Me, i was having headaches though… I hope it goes away for you."

174339500,"The “alien sound” coming from the apartment upstairs is back again. I recorded some audio, but the cars are still passing by, so I put an alarm at 1 am. If the sound is still there then, I’ll make another recording to maybe get a clearer audio. The voices said they’re going to kill me if I can hear it during playback (that means the “spirit” controlling my body will kill me; and if it wants me dead it’s going to try it). They said that if the sound is real it might mean the neighbors upstairs may be guilty in causing my “schizophrenia”, which must not be the case - I myself must be guilty in it, they say."

175948074,Hopefully it goes away with a balanced mood. Otherwise you might need to bulk up on your coping skills toolbox. I've been reading more which helps me be distracted from thoughts that make me want to self harm. Listening to music. Going for a walk in the park. Texting friends. Doing artwork.

175948084,My 20 year old daughter feels bad after eating sugar and meat
174339509,I was on 600 mg clozapine(leponex) in 1996 and it removed all the positive symptoms as the only antipsychotic I tried. but the side effect burden was to much to handle. I drolled. Got severe constipation. Was sedated. And gained 36 pound in half a year. So I quit. Now I am on 3 antipsychotics that works just as well as Clozapine with a lot less sideeffects. It took me 22 years before my psychosis was just as well controlled as on Clozapine. If you are young and have tried a lot of antipsychotics with no good results. And you can tolerate the side effects of Clozapine then go for it.Choose to get a life before you grow old.

175948086,"But that’s the thing. You say that, and I get that Chick-fil-a is awful donating money to LGBT conversion camps, but like, they could be doing much worse. Nestle went to poor African countries and told the women that Nestle baby formula was healthier than breast milk. They proceeded to offer the women the formula for free until the babies would no longer take breast milk, then jacked up the price so that the women had no choice but to purchase it. Oh, and the women who couldn’t afford the formula? Nestle just let the babies die. Apple allows their phones to be made by child laborers in sweatshops, and they justify it by saying that Apple sweatshops aren’t as bad as those of other companies. Like, they’re still sweatshops, they’re just not as hellish as others. People always want to talk to me about social awareness and moral values when I want to eat at Chick-fil-a, but I don’t see anyone boycotting iPhones or Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies. At least the owner of Chick-fil-a believes 
he’s doing the right thing (he’s not, but still). Companies like Amazon and Walmart know full well that they’re being unethical and immoral, but they continue their practices because they allow the companies to make more and more money. This world is so fûcked up that I don’t even know what to do. Thinking of all the bad shît that I indirectly condone in order to live as comfortably as I do is beginning to make me hate myself. What am I supposed to do? Leave society and go live in a cabin in the middle of some forest with nothing? Hunt for food and warmth and hope that, by some miracle, I don’t become completely unhinged? It’s not possible, and even if it were, it wouldn’t be practical. Like, if that were my plan, I’d be better off just saving myself the trouble and committing suicide. So what am I supposed to do? Good and evil don’t just cancel out. That’s not to say I shouldn’t do anything good; I should and I do; but no matter what, I’m hurting people. And it’s not just my fault
. I know that; the blame doesn’t necessarily belong to any single individual; but me? It’s not like I need the things that I have. The issue is that I don’t want to give this lifestyle up. I enjoy having a smartphone, and fast food, and TV, and video games. Those things are important to me, even though they probably shouldn’t be. I dunno. For some reason, I’ve been thinking a lot about my moral code and the moral implications of my decisions and desires. Condoning certain evils because I have to is completely different from condoning them because it’s more comfortable for me. I don’t know what I’m going to do. If I tried to leave home for any reason, I’d barely make it down the stairs before I found myself in another hospital. Not that I think I could survive on my own. It’d be pretty irresponsible, anyhow. Without my meds, I’m liable to be a danger to others in addition to being a danger to myself. Plus, I can’t do much good for anyone that far off of the grid. I’m good with math an
d computers. If I ever do anything brilliant, it’ll most likely have some sort of connection to technology. Part of me just wants all of this to be over. No more mulling over whether or not I’ll go to hell, or whether or not I deserve to go to hell. Whether I really am a bad person, or if I just feel like one. Whether or not my actions (or inactions) have caused some sort of harm, like the butterfly effect or some shît."

175948091,"I can relate 100% with this. Everyday is a struggle, each and everyone. But please know you are strong, you deserve to feel happy and loved. It will come to you. What helps me is finding one little thing to congratulate myself on. Like hey you got up without hitting snooze 5 times. Good job. Oh you showered early today, way to go. I struggle with love always have, hope I wont always will. Just be kind to yourself. Anxiety will have you questioning and doubting everything. We cant turn our brain and feelings off but we can try to fight those bad thoughts. Be pateint and understanding with yourself, your a work in progress."
175948092,"About my brother, I mean. It’s only been in recent months that I’ve noticed what a control freak he is and I’d like to think the reason he’s causing me stress is because we’ve been in each other’s hair too much lately. I was okay with someone coming in to clean my apartment just the once, but I just haven’t had the energy to get the stuff to have it done a 2nd time. Now he wants me to ask my case manager if there was some way they could help me with my grief. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t the first time I have seen narcissistic traits in him, although my sister in law has also expressed her concern. I hope I’m not reading too much into this, but he’s kind of driving me up the wall. I’m looking forward to seeing my pdoc at least, on Friday."

175948098,"_PERSON_, It really is true what they say...'Comparison is the thief of joy' I understand how you feel. My sister who has made some bad choices and hurt people who are/were close to her...married a ridiculously rich man (after cheating on her husband) and now has 3 houses around the world and lives a VERY privileged lifestyle. I on the other hand have been 100% faithful to my spouse, and have pretty much been the textbook 'good girl' live a comfortable, but modest life compared to her. It took me a while to realize that riches are measured in more than money and material things. When we focus on what we have...what we have achieved beyond how society defines success. that is often where we find peace. How do you treat others...do you like the person that you are...how do you make positive differences in the lives of your loved ones/friends? Those are questions that can really up your joy meter! Wishing you a new and happier perspective on this, so you can eliminate the unwanted feelings! S.C."
175948099,"Locally conducted polls have consistently shown that a significant minority of forum members don’t believe that I suffer from schizophrenia and/or that my unusual beliefs are not truly delusional. Whilst encouraging, these results have failed to completely assuage my psychiatric hypochondriasis. In short, to put it on a more scientific footing: am I mad as a March hare? Listed below are most, if not all, my unusual beliefs from the last three years. Most of them were transient, and virtually none held with absolute conviction, I was always in two minds about them. The question is, is to possible to have held all these beliefs (typically with low conviction) and NOT suffer from a psychotic disorder? Unusual Beliefs: I was replaced with an identical copy of myself. The hospital I was in was replaced by an identical looking building. My brain literally moved location. I could contact telepathically with trees. Rain is evil, perhaps a hoax. The universe was born 3 years ago, on 24 May 2018 to be prec
ise. I am the only “human” in the universe. I co-created the universe with the devil. Trees, not men, are the true children of god. I don’t exist. I don’t suffer from SZ, just OCD. Other people are just other versions of myself within the simulation. The devil wants to keep me alive in order to use my divine spark to hold the “universe” together. So, what do you think? Evidence of genuine psychosis despite the low degree of conviction, or just a quasi-psychotic style of thinking, eccentric perhaps but not that serious?"
175948100,I’ve definitely decided to not take it. Ah well …

To those who do not know my situation, I have a neuromuscular disease which atrophies my muscles. Recently my knees have been atrophying. My legs are atrophying so it is incredibly hard to use stairs now. Using stairs will inevitably ruin my knees and make me suffer in pain and ruin my knee joints. My doctor told me not to ever use the stairs again. How on earth am I ever going to go there now? Oh my god. So my mom went by herself and I am going to call my pdoc separately. No face-to-face appointments unless we find another doctor’s office. What the heck. I hate inaccessibility."

Sure you’ll always take a side seat to the parents if you’re just an uncle but you can make a big difference in those kids life still!! My favorite uncle psssed away a few years ago and he was very outgoing. I miss him a lot still. I’d hope I can be a similar example as an uncle as him.

I dealt with the sexual side effects for a really long time so having some desire and enjoyment back is great. I know that I need some type of SSRI/SSNI to help with my symptoms.

174339507,"I don’t mean the following in a sardonic manner but rather an important insight that came to me much later in life. Everyone who starts off starts off with their sanity handed to them but what good is that? A sanity which you did not work hard to build yourself? When you come to learn how ignorant and lazy minded many are isn’t it a worry they are the ones who served as the architect who built the basket we are hoping to get through this life with; keeping our crackers unscathed; our marble collection complete? And since most are too lazy to ask or take time to think about bigger questions they won’t be there for each other should one of them drop their basket during tough times. I propose that what many of your are going through now, whether or not you realize it, is building a much stronger impenetrable sanity for yourselves. How many people do you know around you could still manage their life if they were to discover that good ol’ fashioned Star Trek telepathy was a ‘thing’ and that 
depictions of our world as floating ball of water in the middle of nowhere could be challenged by kids learning entry level physics? Especially those who cling desperately to the smoo fed to them insisting everyone do so as well and not seek out further knowledge or ask more questions than most people do. Epistemophobia is the fear of knowledge There is no term for ‘the fear of ignorance’ At the end of all this you will have more empathy, insight, a much better understanding of how the mind operates and will rejoice in the fact that we are lost and that _NAME_ isn’t the best the universe can muster.

175948149,"I think I see some people saying: Stop implying that I’m lazy because I can’t get over my negatives and accomplish as much as you. I’m not you. I think I see other people saying: We are just encouraging you to keep trying. We know it may not be laziness. You might find a way to get more motivated if you keep trying. Overall, the encouragement might be very useful, and it might be very useful for the people who have been struggling for years to let off a little steam, I guess.

175948153,"Most of my instructors rely heavily on emotional appeal. I've always gotten angry or disgusted when people force emotional tourism and sentimentalism upon me because it seems like just because they get off on it, they want to subject me to it as well the same way people enjoy watching Hollywood dramas and romances. Now, I've been realizing it's a custom; a generally effective one at that. Giving people this sentiment to wallow in, and feed off, romanticizes and increases empathy or captures the sympathy of their students to their cause. Not that I disagree with the cause most of the time. The idealism is ridiculous though; I think it goes back to the aforementioned romanticizing, empathizing and sympathizing."

It’s a notoriously difficult place to date. I did grow up in Fairfax County, a really rich county in the area. I recently heard our county mentioned on one of the major national news channels, mentioned in contrast I think to nearby areas that are in financial trouble. It’s just as expensive to live in CA near San _NAME_, except the minimum wage is $12 dollars an hour and I think they’re trying to raise it to 15?

I literally left the house 1-2 hours a week, always with my husband and not alone. My pdoc had told me that there was no AP that specifically targeted paranoia, so we just assumed I would always suffer with it. I’d already tried Abilify and Geodon but they didn’t help. When she changed me to Zyprexa from Haldol, I was paranoia-free after only six weeks, and it’s stayed gone. I am no longer disabled. It’s my miracle med. Sounds like it’s yours too! YAY! If you’re careful with your eating, you don’t have to gain weight. I have been limiting to 1200-1400 calories a day since I started in mid-March and I have lost 28 pounds so far.

175948262,"Oh. I guess I don’t know what you mean, then. I thought it meant you weren’t doing things, most kids did."
174339536,"I studied the insula in university, its like a small brain deep in the brain. It also functions in olfactory information processing."

175948264,Every noise causes me so much anxiety when I’m alone.
175948265,"Always have you guys, you guys help a lot. Daily peer to peer support system, that’s a huge boon."
175948266,"Same here. ????. I’m religious, but this “every thought is being spied on” ???? is a huge violation of privacy. I’m still scared of what happens after death, which is why I stay religious."
175948267,"Hope everybody has a good day today, and I hope the weather is good for you today."
175948268,It got worse a few years after my first hospitalisation it got much worse and lasted a few years.voices etc Then itgog better and was better a while and then I had another break down with delusions.no voices this time thankfully. After medication increased it stopped. Now I’m well thankfully. Hope I don’t have another episode.
174339534,"I’ve been in your shoes! Listening to any voices is a bad idea (mine are saying I’m only saying this because I’m jealous of you because I haven’t embraced my telepathic powers) sometimes I think I can hear others thoughts and it especially freaks me out when it turns out to be true… but none of that is real. If you dive too deep inside your mind you’ll start to believe what the voices tell you and then the hallucinations will get stronger… stay strong and seek help, and remember… the doctor is right. None of that is real."
175948269,"Sorry you're going through a tough time _PERSON_. The thing with the strawberries would make anyone more pissed off and ashamed than anything. I'm unemployed but I don't feel bad for multiple reasons. You seem to have negative thinking and intrusive thoughts. You need to accept where you are and try to change it. It won't happen overnight. I took a weed gummy, vaped CBD and now I'm gonna drink some beer. I took my beta blocker cuz my heart is beating fast. I'm thankful for anti-anxiety medication.."
175948270,_PERSON_ i think they are trying catch your eye making think there high capicty batteries. If they still work im happy.
175948271,"I wake around noon every day so that means I necessarily miss breakfast. I eat lunch, dinner, and two snacks every day and I maintain my weight. My BMI is normal. I keep my daily calorie intake between approximately 1200 to 1450 a day with about 250 calories per day in exercise."
175948272,"it was foolish but i once set out for california. it would have been fine if i drove there, but walking is frowned upon. i didn’t want anything to do with a car at that point in my life, i thought they were such a hassle and money pit. i made it 200 miles into illinois before i was picked up in the middle of nowhere. later i tried to hike to _NAME_. i made it over a hundred miles, to lagrange, kentucky. once i again i was picked up and had to wait 2 weeks in jail. when the judge asked me what i was doing there. i said im hiking to _NAME_, and following the stars, i also added this is bs and im going to expatriate. the judge granted my release and a couple hours later i was on my way. one of the cops drove me to nearby louisville and he was so chummy, we talked about the cincinnati bengals the whole time. surreal it was. looking back im amazed i made it as far as i did. there is the american discovery trail that goes coast to coast but im not sure where it is. now if it’s not a common practice t
o hike through a area i don’t do it."
175948273,This is a good goal!
175948274,It’s a weird yet completely valid phenomenon that one dislikes doing something when they are forced to rather than when they are simply allowed to.
174339538,It’s been commonly reported for years. If your multi episodic it’s meds for life or till cure. If your not on meds then good luck to you but you’d be interested in diagnosis. With things being so long there’s issues with street drugs and what you’d call intermittent psychosis. It might not necessarily be schizophrenia but I reckon it is a spectrum.
174339537,Illness like schizophrenia and parkinson’s is not just related to dopamine levels. It’s more rooted in dysfunctions in the pathways that use dopamine. It’s not like dopamine is a gas tank and your low on gas so you need to fill it up or anything like that.
175948275,The weed seems to have allowed me to stay up until midnight instead of going to sleep early (9-10pm) to avoid life.
175948276,_PERSON_ just ate a snack and had some juice. Thanks!
175948277,"Wow, you put a lot of emotions in this post. I’m sorry the voices have been unrelenting. This illness is very severe and debilitating. If you don’t mind me asking, are you taking medicine?"
174339541,If the God you believe in really cared nobody would suffer. I wouldn’t have schizophrenia. I’d truly be happy. Evil reigns supreme in this Universe. Maybe in the Multiverse too.
174339540,You are doing great. Abilify helps with cognitive symptoms.
175948278,"It is possible and I know as an ocd sufferer how bad intrusive thoughts can be. That said obsessive compulsive symptoms, as opposed to full-blown ocd, are common among people diagnosed with psychotic disorders and sometimes caused by the meds."
175948279,"yea…me too. 3 years all together I just want to know which reasons people have to go to hospital, with force or without"
174339543,the key is to have no syptoms like me
175948280,Why do you want to come off? Do you feel bad on the meds?
175948281,I'm really depressed about how much candy I've eaten since last week. I really don't want to gain back the 12 pounds I lost.
175948282,"You can cook with it but its not recommended at high temperatures. _NAME_ oil, with its relatively low smoke point of 325 to 375°F (165 to 190°C)"

175948284,Potentially yes 155555
175948285,"What are you talking about? If you want to smoke weed and it’s legal in your state, You should be allowed, regardless. My pdoc knows of my usage and has never discouraged it."
174339544,I couldn’t hold a job for more than 1-2 weeks while on Abilify and couldn’t even have the motivation to apply for a job on other meds
175948286,Where will you be?
175948287,Whos singing? You ? Sounds epic
175948288,Maybe it was just a little too much at one time.
175948289,I’m proud of you for being patient without panicking. I’m starting to look to you as an example. Congrats!
175948290,35-45 i dont go too high. thats all how about you. o sorry i didnt see your post 100 wow thats high. lol.
175948291,"back then I was just starting to get into health. I would spend a lot of money on organic groceries. I remember when I got home from work in the mornings I would often make me and my roommate breakfast. my go to was gluten free pancakes with blueberries to sweeten it up. I also remember having a copy of barack _PERSON_’s dreams from my father or something which I never read laying around. my health kick would provide the motivation to stop drinking shortly after, but then I started drinking again when I began to isolate a couple years later"
175948292,"I still do it… And grant credit to my happier self (because I have been) … to that I’m disconnecting to ???? tie r fare on porn hub. That’s not even the way to put it; but scrolling which I guess one does subjects you to so much in itself. I haven abstained all the way but I’m disconnected from it… also the pretty images… maybe what is known as ‘female friendly’ fare, you know I’ve liked that stuff, But either the site got a lawsuit or they moved images/videos to ‘premium’ something about it all is helping me get away and the end result is good to me. Still nothing wrong with cleaning the pipes. I think it’s good for the prostate."
174339547,I would call it “my rabid black dog”.

175948294,Thanks Pianogal.
174339545,"That’s very true but, I checked . . On Danish FDA it says, when reporting side - effects, there are unknown or, not properly represented side - effects . . I read a Medical article that said, it’s well-known in medicine, among doctors . . when a new drug hits the market, not all side - effects have been found . . I do read the list that follows the pills, and they all say the drugs, anti-psychotics and, some anti-depressants increase Prolactin, above normal . . The incidence is often listed as like, over 10 % . . Again, I’ve read articles saying when they research it, they find that number is ’ 30 - 55 % ’ Or, ’ 50 - 85 % ’ but, because side - effect lists only have the category, ’ Over 10 % ', it looks mis-leading . . The Danish FDA also writes, that these lists are strangely written . . For instance, if it says ’ 1 - 10 % ’ get some side - effect, like Prolactin, that can mean 10 % get it, within a week or, that 1 % get it, only after a year . . So, the Official side - effect 
lists are kind a Not so good, for Scientific information, you’re left guessing . . The Danish FDA wrote this to me, in a message, where I asked them . . My point is simply this . . On Risperdal, I felt I had many emotions, like a pregnant woman, and, it felt bad . . I told my doctor and, he said that’s not a side - effect . . But, the articles and, books, for instance Oxford University Book on Hormone science ( Endocrinology ) says it does . . And, many other books, web-pages by doctors or, professors and, research articles says it does . . My doctor admitted that the articles and, books were good and, praised me for finding them, my Own psychiatrist . . So, we made a deal, we agreed to put me on Clozapine, which causes almost no Prolactin and, it went away . . I just wanted to ask if other people had experienced this on Risperdal, if so, just ask for another drug . . My Doctor obliged immediately, he was happy to switch drugs and, blood tests confirmed my Prolactin got a lower, so, it was nice . . What c
oncerns me is, this side - effect appears to be predicted, by medicine, the books, the articles . . But, why isn’t it on any side - effect list, for Risperdal . . Any-way, I got pregnant woman moods, my nipples grew in size and, they became sensitive, ’ tingling ’ . . I also developed pregnancy delusions and, it was very hard . . So, I told my doctor, showed him the articles and, he recommended Clozapine or, Abilify . . I didn’t want to try Abilify so, I was put on Clozapine . . Now, I have no side - effects, unless I wake at night, when I get the pills, other than that, no side - effects . . Prolaktin Giver maternal instinct 04-4.jpg 1920×1080 396 KB This article, by a Gynecologist-obstetrician says the same thing . . Any-way, I’ve found Zyprexa is good and, Ziprasidone ( Geodon ? ! ), the side - effects get better and, on Clozapine they basically are gone, no matter, gone . . I just wanted to ask, if other people had these experiences on the older drugs or, Risperdal . . that are know, to elevate 
Prolactin more than the other later, second - generation drugs . . Clozapine, in particular, doesn’t cause this . ."
175948295,"Yes _PERSON_, I think you are right about perceiving things. A lot of it is how we look at things. I try to stay positive, but sometimes it is hard. But I am finding in my older age, less things worry me than use to. I tend to forget about my problems until they re-arise. Keeps me from worrying so much though. I wish you guys a lovely day. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175948296,"I’m just so tired of over-thinking these days, that on some level I just wish i could go to sleep and never wake up. When your whole world becomes the daily cryptic crossword, it really is mentally exhausting."
175948297,My hair gets terribly matted here. Brushing it makes me cry. So I keep meaning to brush it more often.
175948298,"My energy and weight are my main issues at the time. Ever since I had the hormonal IUD I started putting on a ton of weight, I was already overweight and now it’s so much worse and I’m showing no signs of stopping. I’m hungry constantly. I even had the IUD taken out but nothing has changed. And I never have any energy. My narcolepsy meds make it so I no longer have to sleep during the day, but I still sleep on average 11-12 hours at night and still wake up feeling drained and like I have no energy until I have a lot of caffeine which interacts with my narcolepsy meds and messes with my heart. My narcolepsy meds do not give me energy, rather just prevent sleepiness. I feel so sluggish during the day like every small action takes great effort. I always feel like I am a car running on E. People just think I’m lazy when in reality I am just deeply fatigued."
174339549,you dont know if he needs them
175948299,I’ve seen it all
175948300,"I get my medical and psychiatric care through the VA. My VA pdoc suggested I go through therapy about a year ago. I waited about a year before I was finally connected with a therapist who interviewed me. After the interview, he announced to me that I was well adjusted and in no need of therapy. I took that as great news."
175948301,There is rise a huge rise in cases of people of all ages suffering because of covid fears and lock downs
175948302,"Do you know what caused them to cry? I haven’t heard you mention them crying before, only the torture/hell related topics. I’m sorry that must be horrible My best wishes to you _AT_MENTION_ !"
175948303,"Thank you! I get scared once in a while, but I’ve learned not to read too deep into my voices and delusions. Take care, and stay strong."
175948304,"I read his letter. If a dead person dies, they don't test him in Germany, so it doesn't go into the count. It's actually one of the reason they give for the relatively low number. I am sure he knows that. The issue of primary cause is a contentious issue, and also the one of not testing after death. That's why all countries have different protocols. France had the same, until yesterday, where they added more deaths suddenly. They weren't counting people not hospitalized. China has those same protocols, and they are accused of covering up by US Republicans. His issue is a real issue, but it is the other way around. Lots of deaths caused by the virus are simply not reported by some countries. Overall it does not make a big difference, not in the grand scheme of things. Yes, emergency rooms are not full of people, because people are more afraid of the virus, so they don't go to the emergency, it was reported in some places. The amounts are still low in the US, but people that do get complications get 
into beds for weeks, you won't see them in the emergency room. Not yet anyway, maybe in a couple weeks. https://www.businessinsider.com/video-t ... tic-2020-3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCRPp1Qy5yY It's not ebola either, lot less lethal. In five weeks it should be the biggest pandemic since the Spanish flu, a hundred years ago. Ebola was not contagious enough, so it was only a small epidemic. It was gruesome and dangerous, but did not do too many deaths. I don't think the guy in that video denied there were deaths, so I am not sure why you bring it up, not part of his argument."
175948305,"I think your inner skeptic is not being very skeptical. Wow. The signal from your TV back to “them,” why wouldn’t it be detected by someone? There are actually TV repair people who sometimes take someone’s TV apart. They notice no strange components? The signal would need to be monitored by a lot of people who would need to stay hidden for a long time without anyone detecting. A lot of people would need to know about this and let nothing slip. It would be extremely costly. And it would be totally fúcking useless. You get to see all kinds of random people sitting in their couch with their beer belly watching some stupid game show. The government is in the business of spreading completely crazy ridiculous myths that no-one except a couple of crackpots believes? Don’t you think they have better things to do? Don’t you think that if they want to control people through misinformation they’d concoct something that a majority of people actually believe? I also find your sinister plotters un
convincing because they are lacking in one property that every human group I’ve ever encountered has in abundance: incompetence ."
174339542,Earlier one of the members on another topic was saying that it’s part of the negative sz symptoms and I too kind of agreed with him. But I need to get more opinions on this. Personally for me I don’t have interest on having a job and settling down in life. But I eat a lot and watch a lot of tv shows series movies sports and browse the internet alright… so one persistent question that comes from my parents and my sister is… aren’t you motivated to do those above mentioned things… to which I have no answer. I don’t know what to say.
175948306,Usually i take a benzo and lie down with eyes closed. I also took a clozapine prn
175948307,"Thank you all for the encouraging words. I’m feeling better today, but I’m very irritable for some reason"
175948308,"I didn't want to wake up today. I had a good deep sleep, dreams.. But my soul is still extremely exhausted."
175948309,Everyone in bed?
175948310,i took respridone.yeah that one is close enough.it didnt do well with me.
174339551,You can have SZ without hallucinations. You can have delusions or just negative and cognitive symptoms.
175948311,day after day hour after hour try to lift my spirits but still aint got the power day after day the minutes closing in only thing i can say i’m alive so thats a win
175948312,"No…I like you on here, you are a valuable person. My house is horrible right now as well, my old house. I dont let anybody in there, so ashamed am i. So i understand you feel bad. But it is good you dare ask for help. And it says nothing about your worth as a person, at all. I know horrible persons with very clean and tidy houses and lovely people with the messiest homes."
175948313,"Now that I’m off risperidone I’m finding my sleep pattern is out of whack, too. I guess in the end I get a full night’s sleep but I keep waking up every 3 hours and staying awake for 1-2 hours. If this keeps up I may try melatonin, it’s supposed to help with this kind of thing."
175948314,"I am not sure what you are trying to tell me exactly but I do not work, not even a charity which I think that’s what you are saying. Have a good day. _AT_MENTION_"
175948315,"You are just really smart and have a lot of thoughts and are self conscious. No cameras, look at other people as like you and need a word to help them."
175948316,"I personally don’t see much of “silver lining” to this pandemic. It’s dumbing down the children because they can’t go to school, it’s taking lives, it’s destroying economies. I can’t wait until it’s over. I really don’t see any upside to it. I guess it’s good to look on the bright side though. I’m kind of a homebody myself anyway, so it doesn’t affect me personally as much as some but I hate to see my country suffering and going downhill. I’m eager to see things go back to normal before it does any more damage."
175948317,What posts are you referring to? The only delusion I ever had was being killed.

175948322,"I let hubby go out and but a physical copy of a game because he was ???????? about it so bad. He had paid 130 for the CE of Persona 5 Royal Phantom thieves edition, and it was released on March 31st. We’ve been locked down since March 17th. Gamestop was paid in full for preorder back on Dec 3, 2019. They will not answer our emails and their customer service is only open 6 hours a day M-F, with over they estimated 50k people prepaid for preorder of CE. I just want the damned thing shipped. So I will be on the phone at 8am. We did get an email from Gamestop that his full paid preorder of FFV7Remake CE is being shipped to us. I’m going to war, cause that’s 180 bucks sropped on P5R now. Yeah, we’ll sell the sealed one in the box, cause it’s hard to get but I’m not gonna gouge somebody. But my _PERSON_ wants the collectibles like Joker’s mask, and the other cool things. But since I told hubby to just get the ??????? game and shut the ???? up about it he said I get 100 dollars to spend on m

174339552,"Here is the wikipedia schizophrenia citation, I don’t think stress alone can cause sz bcz otherwise poor countries will have a higher rate of sz which is not true: Estimates of the heritability of schizophrenia are between 70% and 80%, which implies that 70% to 80% of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is associated with genetics."
174339560,"Visited my pdoc the other yesterday and it turns out I never had sz, but instead some symptoms of a Personality Disorder, not any specific, also, these personality disorders are a pretty subjective thing depending on the culture of the place you live,etc. It seems as you grow up these disorders fade away, I still have some symptoms but they were stronger as kid as I remember. Always been a pretty peculiar person but always managed to do good by adapting, I have a high intelligence to make up for it LOL I’m a very sensitive person too, stress can really mess me up, that was the problem at my adolescence so I ended in a bad state and having to visit the pdoc. Doctor told me to quit meds at the end of 2018, whole 2019 has been the best year of my life, or maybe just as good as before all this started. Now, it seems I’m ‘cured’ the pdoc discharged me.

It is probably how it really felt for her, in panic. My brothers spoke to her later, when she had time to get it together and think of a diplomatic way to tell it. She probably thought of some positive things in what the doc said and also, knowing her, tried to protect them by telling it in a somewhat rose-coloured way.

175948357,i get stiff joints and the pdoc put me on procyclidine which helps
175948358,Psychiatry is pretty important yeah. I would have been completely homeless without it.
175948359,Funny my question was liked but not answered.
175948360,"Can’t really afford things on disability, so at least not util some accumulative stages where I save up some finances, but even then, no point on spending up my money on expensive clothing. So i choose little more humble brands. Here where I live it’s called “Penneys” an equivalent US version I believe is a Walmart. Which thank God is rather cheap if one is struggling with the money."
174339559,"If you wrote this with schizophrenia, props. Hard as hell to do big things with the disease."
175948361,Have I missed something ? Are you moving? I remember you writing you plan to move to another area/neighbourhood that is safer and nicer. Has the time come? Did you say yes to that third teaching job? You would have Friday’s off?
175948362,"I get confused if the poll means on or off meds. If I go off my meds I would probably go into psyhcosis, but I’m doing fine on meds, so I voted maybe."

175948364,Morning Having coffee
175948365,It’s taken being with my newest pdoc for the last 4 years for it to subside. I still get angry when I hear stories about what people are going through though
175948366,good luck at the hospital! I hope everything goes well for you
175948367,Just got a feeling like I was being careful about what I said like I was being recorded and I didn’t want to say anything incriminating. Reminds me of when the cameras were in the house

175948377,"Same old apathy, same old avolition. Story of my ruined life. So much I want to do, but so little done, if anything at all. I am starting to doubt my career as a writer as I’m running out of words. My books aren’t long enough. Ideas slow. I guess work when it’s a good day…but these are so few…three days in two months… And my art - my husband is encouraging me to paint and I want to but I have no pictures in my head. Artists block I guess. Why why why does this sza have to steal my life??? How do I paint again? And more importantly - how do I keep on painting? Do I have to drag myself to my easel and try pick up a 100 ton paintbrush? Painting every day…making good canvases…if life were so easy…but sza f**ks it up. How does one get out of this rut of avolition? Or must one resign to suffering it for life?"

175948384,I created a new instagram account yesterday and received a message saying “remember me? Hi how r u?” It made me paranoid that someone from my past was stalking me so I deleted my account. They had no followers and weren’t following anyone. I couldn’t make out the photo. Is this some sort of common scam?

I don’t notice my mood symptoms much anymore, but I’ve recovered a good deal from my initial psychosis and rarely have episodes, so I definitely believe I have a better prognosis. I was surprised to find it had a better prognosis at first because it seemed to me that it was two diseases in one."

174339576,"Doesn’t happen often but when it does it’s so terrible. Feels like someone sprayed pepper spray into your brain. Had a bad episode last night. When I wake up in the middle of the night with Akathisia I usually pace around my apartment, maybe go into the hallway outside to walk around (although I couldn’t get the door open yesterday so it felt even more claustrophobic). Ativan helps but good lord is it a long 15-20 minutes for that to kick in. While I’m waiting I like to lie down on my couch in the living room, for some reason the change of scenery helps. Anyone got any tips on how to deal with this awfulness? Or what causes it? I had a lot to drink last night and I take clozapine, I wonder if that triggered it?"
175948396,"I am sorry to hear that. I had best friends too who just stood by and did nothing when I needed them to help me. The worst example was when I told someone in my small group of friends I had been diagnosed with Sz, and I have not heard from them since. I find comfort in the fact that as an adult, you don’t have to tolerate this kind of thing on a daily basis. For me that’s why I am glad that it’s all over."
175948397,I don’t sleep right and i don’t eat right the rest is mostly under control but these 2 things are not it seems both need a huge decision to move in the right direction - which is i guess - working very slowly

175948400,"I’m unkempt, chubby, and never dress up. I used to get told I was handsome, but years of voices picking on me have ruined my self esteem. I don’t think I’m attractive. Regardless of what others say. It actually triggers me when I hear compliments. I get super paranoid that they’re lying to me, saying it sarcastically, picking on me. It actually hurts in my chest, a dropped out feeling, when it happens. Such is the disease."

Distractions help too."
175948410,It’s very crazy to believe that there is a camera hiding somewhere but I really do believe that. But how could that be? The camera would need a lens and transmitter and you would be able to see that. I need help.

175948413,Feeling good today. Yesterday wasn't a bad day at all either. Everything is wet outside and mildewy outside but warm. It's nice.
175948414,Alcohol. By far worse for me. I stop eating for days when im on a bender - and my mood plummets to pure depression. Weed at least gives me the munchies - tho the voices come back with a vengance and im im too paranoid to get out the flat. There are both evil to me in different ways.

Just the way I look at it. And if the abilify doesn't work then a switch would be needed. It only took a day or two for me to notice a difference in the way I was feeling. But I think a lot and it stopped that. Makes it easier to stay in the ""now"". It settled my mood. Abilify is also for bi-polar, though I am not bi-polar. But it has helped me a lot. I hope I am not confusing you more. Do whatever is right for you. I just wanted to let you know how it helps me. I know it is scary.

175948499,"Has anyone else ever had a delusion that helped them? Or that was extremely painful to leave behind because it’s become so much a part of you, maybe even your “raison d’ê_NAME_”? I’m afraid of what will happen if this really is a delusion and antipsychotic meds cure me. I don’t know how I will be able to cope with the loss, the void left in its wake, and the humiliation of believing yourself to be worthy of a love you were not worthy of. Anyway, my delusion went like this: this professor and I became pretty close and at some point I started to believe he was infatuated with me and indirectly communicating his desire to have an affair with me via coded language/doublespeak in his lectures and paper comments. Some of them were plausible while others were downright bizarre. For instance, I interpreted what I believed to be an excessive use of words beginning with the letter “s” in an email to me, to be his way of playfully aligning himself with the “hissing” serpent who seduced Ev
e and tempted her to eat from the forbidden fruit. Everything started seeming like a metaphor in some ancient, myopic love story. It was thrilling. However, I was terrified and “rejected” him (by essentially ignoring what I perceived to be his advances and telling him I thought he had “misinterpreted my platonic, academic admiration”). At this point I became increasingly paranoid (I thought he was threatening to kill me because the word “you” had been left out of an email, for example). I left school for a semester and when I came back and saw him in person I almost immediately realized how harmless he was. I recovered from my psychotic blip without medicine or therapy, though it never stopped seeming, to me, like he was infatuated with me. (Even now four years later). It’s important to know that I was on adderall and extremely sleep deprived when it started, but I wonder then why it continued (for months?) once the adderall wore off. I was also extremely stressed and overwhelmed by my family si
tuation, my academic struggles, my depression and anxiety and most importantly my overwhelming feelings for/growing dependency on this professor. I’m estranged from my father and we have never been close. When I was little, my father used to french kiss me and our relationship was I suppose generally rather sexualized and then I was 19 I was drugged and essentially raped by two strangers in France, to whom I lost my virginity. Since I was drugged I don’t remember it much nor do I feel traumatized by it nearly as much as I feel traumatized by all of the emotional abuse I think I endured growing up. Whatever the case, it felt like no one had ever talked to me or treated me the way my professor did. When we talked in office hours it was like he really saw me. He encouraged me, valued my mind, and seemed like he really cared. He wasn’t afraid of me when I told him about some of my mental struggles. He told me I was smart and special and we talked about books for up to an hour at a time. I was lonely, friend
less, intellectually curious and starved for love, affection and companionship. I was also sexually inexperienced (and perhaps a bit confused by some past sexual experiences). All this combined with the fact that I am naturally imaginative and prone to fantasy and “overthinking.” I think it was all just the perfect storm for a temporary bout of “madness.” I only told psychiatrists about this after the fact (I was not in therapy during the time that the delusion was actually occurring). They gently told me that I had experienced psychosis. I’ve read awful things about antipsychotics and am highly skeptical of big pharma, etc., etc.. I don’t know whether or not I’m still delusional. I do know that if I am delusional about his infatuation with me, I’m not sure I could cope with having that delusion taken away from me. He is one of the only people that motivates me to get out of bed and want to study. It pains me more than I can say when I think about the fact that, to thin, I am probably just som
e desperate, pathetic, annoying, immature and unstable student. I feel utterly Humiliated. Ridiculous. Pathetic. How can I ever trust any of my thoughts? Does anyone even like me? Am I delusional about everything? I don’t think it’s possible for anyone to love me sometimes. How could they? My head burns and my face is all flushed."

We have to tell ourselves that we matter and are valued and we alone are not the problem or did not cause the problems. We might also have to accept that no one cares about us more than we do, so we might just have to accept people being unsupportive and take care of ourselves and not expect much so that we are not disappointed. We must have faith that we will soon find people that understand and are supportive. I think group therapy might help."

175948510,"I've side-stepped around management roles as carefully as I can. As attractive as they can sometimes be, I realise that I am probably not quite as well suited to them as others, despite recommendations to take on this kind of responsibility. I've found that roles where I have autonomy and control my own workflow have been most fulfilling so far. In sales, I was given autonomy proportional to my performance. In consulting, we're treated as an independent arm of the firm and so generally people don't tend to have a hierarchal way of thinking about us. We're senior and to be respected when we weigh in but, otherwise, it's fairly distant from the main structure. Once inserted into management, you're instantly wedged between everybody else's needs below and above you and the responsibility that flows each way. I think the biggest turnoff for me is in responsibility. I like that when selling I was a free agent with my own book and business and as a consultant I can do the analysis and make a recommendati
on and even project manage for a bit but otherwise I'm just an outside pair of eyes that can wander off when I'm satisfied that I've done my bit and move on to something else, allowing the core group to deal with the stuff I cant be arsed with. I like working in a capacity where my role is not dependent on others to be successful. This I feel is a great source of satisfaction for me, since generally I am tentative in delegating to others where that responsibility given is important towards my outcomes."

175948554,"Really? There's a world of difference between believing in, for example, gravity and believing in some god. The difference is seen in how people cling to the idea. I believe in gravity because I've seen its effect and I've read explanations as to how it probably works. I don't have an emotional connection to that belief. If someone came up with a new theory that made my belief wrong, I'd switch my belief to match what I thought was true. You talk to people with a religion and every one, without exception, has their belief rely on vague, circular reasoning that says, ""Well, we don't really know, so it must be what I've chosen to believe,"" skipping that vast chasm of ignorance between cause and effect. And then they all say, ""It makes me feel better."" It's a drug. Agreed. All emotionally connected belief, stating absolutes to things that can't be proved, is religious. The point I'm making is that people choose their ""beliefs"" based on their own psychological needs, nothing to do with any realis
tic search for the truth. I'm not an atheist. I just don't know what the truth is and, in this, I'm the same as anyone else. None of us know, but many of us slam our fists down on the table and state that we're 100% convinced that we know and we'll fight you if you disagree. How is that not disordered? Well, it's not, for two reasons: First, it's based on reason, not vague hope in a story. Second, I don't need to believe in it. It's a hypothesis that could be true, there's reason behind it and no one will believe in it without proof. So it stays as a ""maybe"" not an absolute. But people believe their version of religion, to the point where they make life and death decisions based on it. Well, i kinda agree with this to a point. It's better to believe in something that gives you comfort, but how? How do people turn off that thought at the back of their mind that says ""this is clearly BS but it makes me feel better."" How is it any different to kids believing in Santa? Belief started by someone looking at the 
moon and crapping themselves, not knowing what it is. All religion, or belief systems, have developed from this. Wanting something to be true doesn't make it true, and wrapping your life around it and making decisions based on belief that has no ground to stand on: how do people do that? If I showed you a green book and told you to believe it was red, you couldn't do it, because fundamentally you'd know it was green. Belief is not a choice. How does someone read a story about a bearded old man shoving a bunch of animals into a boat and saving the world from an enormous flood, when there's so much evidence (and reason) as to why it didn't happen, just go ""I'll believe that?"" Is it simply a matter of sticking your fingers in your ears and saying ""la la la,"" or am I missing something? I don't think it's possible to ""believe"" in a religion, or anything else that has no basis in reason. Not really, not unless you're deluded. You say you believe in it, but you don't; not really."
174339606,"ScienceDaily Unraveling mechanisms of ventricular enlargement linked to schizophrenia Scientists have implicated two microRNAs in the biological processes that underlie the ventricle enlargement observed in models of schizophrenia. The team found that deletion of Dgcr8 reduces the microRNAs miR-382-3p and miR-674-3p. When those microRNAs are reduced, a receptor on the surface of motile cilia lining the ventricle walls called Drd1 is increased. “We found that this mechanism is necessary and sufficient for these two things, reduced motile cilia movement and ventricular enlargement,” _PERSON_ said. “In our model, we were able to remove the microRNAs and get this effect, and we were able to reintroduce these microRNAs and see that the ventricles and cilia return to normal.”"

175948556,"what drives me insane is when people are just like “just give up religion/your spirituality!” Like it is so easy to abandon your entire belief system. Also, spirituality is really important to some people. My spirituality really helps me cope and gives me a sense of purpose and makes me feel not as stressed and terrible about the state of the world and about death. Im not just going to throw that all in the garbage (not that I could if I wanted to) because I’ve had some delusions surrounding it. I mean come on. That’s like saying to become an anarchist and go live off the grid if you have delusions about the government watching you. If it worked for you, great, but just realize its not the most realistic option. For me what helped is realizing if it revolves around me, it is a delusion. If it does not revolve around me, it is a spiritual belief. For example, believing in God is a spiritual belief. Believing God has singled out me to talk to and has given me a special mission, revolves aroun
d me, and is therefore a delusion."

It’s like the moral version of living to fight another day, the unfortunate part being that this does nothing for your emotions. It’s like the world is so shít that I feel guilty for living in it."

I felt that ‘trap’ with Olanzapine and Quetiapine. Olanzapine is a great drug, but I was unable to break my addiction to weed. I was also undisciplined. On Quetiapine, I never had a pot craving and noticed I was way more disciplined. Unfortunately, I experienced extreme body ache and back spasms- too much to bear. I’m a Olanzapine lifer. I still have pot cravings, today is 203 days without thc. I take cbd supplements. I’m still a bit undisciplined, but I made it a resolution to be more present in my thinking."

175948594,"I disagree with the assumption of ""We already know that the person needs to be alone as much as possible. So that's at least a start."" It is not that the person needs to be isolated, it is that I think most are better off with small teams or partnerships that reduces the amount of random social interactions. As an SPD person myself, I have learned through trial/error in so many jobs that I cannot work with high volume social interaction jobs such as grocery store front desk/customer service desk, high school teacher with 35 students, any customer service phone work, general sales floor work such as at a Best Buy. My best jobs have had minimal or incidental contact with the general public and are task/production oriented. The best jobs have been driving jobs such as a repossession agent ""spotter,"" ( I drove around the city all day using a tablet and app looking up addresses to find vehicles on repo list and call in tow truck driver), transport driver for Medicaid patients, (simple pick up/drop o
ff work, minimal conversation with most patients, some engaging topics once in a while), and parking enforcement where my primary interaction is myself checking parking meters through a handheld device, issuing warnings or citations as needed. The social element is narrow, people asking about parking rules, times, etc, or looking for help to find stores. In my personal experience, I have found that I am TOTALLY misread as unfriendly and rude when in fact I have no such feelings or intentions. I just don't follow social cues and customary etiquette very well. For example, I really hate to say ""good morning"" and feel like it is a torturous effort to say it and it will come out as ingenuine, fake, or forced. I get by with ""hey"" or just quickly parrot back ""..morning."" and then mentally cringe for having to force even that out."

175948599,"I agree. Without insurance 1 month supply of my AP is 1400 dollars. Every year before my deductible is met I have to pay 800 something bucks for it out of pocket. Ouch. Luckily once my deductible is met it is free for me. Big pharma is a monstrous empire. They claim they need to charge exorbitant prices to make up for research and development costs, however they spend double that amount on marketing of their “product”, doing things like putting out ads and commercials and literally bribing doctors to prescribe their meds (i wish i was making that up). All of this is entirely unethical and some countries do not even allow the marketing of medications. I believe if we enacted the same policies there would then be no excuse for their massive price gauging. Also practically no first world countries other than America use work related insurance. America says if you don’t have a job you don’t get to live. That is another big issue because many of the people who need meds the most cannot work."

I feel so guilty also, because it would hurt my dear husband if he was aware I was comparing him to my ex. And I feel guilty because I don’t want to be ungrateful to my husband who gives me so much.

They only do fax or paper RX… We just had to contact corporate because I put in my request for refill on August 4th, _PERSON_ went to get it and the day they got it the store chief pharmacist only had 33 pills my ex is 60. And she didn’t call me to say anything, just put it as insurance problem then went on vacation. Husband, who never ever fights with the pharmacy, got the fill in to get it transferred to another walgreens 7 miles away, not 24 hours, and gave us all the info to give corporate. It’s my Xanax, I had 1 pill left and am on 4mg a day every day until some miracle AP comes out I can take. We’re waiting for a call from corporate. Because the head ????? had already said she refuses to fill a lot of my meds as I’m too young for so much pain medication and there’s no way I have not been ok taking any of the AP, mood stabilizer, or AD’s I’ve ever been on. She’s had over 500 complaints since taking 
over in June by the clinic I use for pain management and pdoc. They’ve told her to do her job she is not the doctor, her job is to fill what is prescribed, if she has questions she can contact docs, she will not do it, she chooses to yell at husband and I in front of the lobby loudly announcing nutjobs can’t have both severe pain issues and my documented allergies and reactions to meds. So we’re fighting back, I recorded the last phone call and sent the recording to corporate, she was to be spoken to. She refused to serve me. Told the pharmacy techs not to, but I worked with one as a teen at mcd’s, so he does it anyway. He’s been cut to 4 hours a week, so he has a lawyer after them now. Justice in an old fashioned way. He agreed to write down everything on all dates she’s said something so I’ve got a witness."

175948629,"I think I had three beers once. Since going back on my meds last October. Maybe I’ll drink again. But naltrexone makes it so I don’t get pleasure so I’m not worried about my alcoholic tendencies so much anymore. I had used Vicodin and kratom before starting naltrexone and liked it. Opiates are a thing I avoided by a few feet. Actually the only 4 drugs that I’ve found that even “work” on my meds are weed, ketamine, ambien and benzos. I like my weed and ketamine. I’m never using ambien again. And benzos I know too badly what they do, so I just use it as I should. Medically. Klonopin is a great medicine for me when I use it as I should. Actually never had a problem abusing benzos regularly. But have had 2 bad individual episodes with klonipin where I took too much. I’m just the person who needs a certain level of relief in their system. Last time I went to rehab trying to quit pot mostly I went 29 days I was fine. Then day 30 I lost my mind and relapsed on day 44. Well I feel if I ever 
wanted to put down the joint completely maybe I could ask my pdoc for an increase in klonopin to help me not go so crazy without pot. It’s not like it gets me too high. But if I took 2.0 mg klonopin per day, maybe I could be sober. But I have an anxious mind naturally. So I’d need something"

Children who think poorly of themselves often underachieve in school. A new Dutch study tested whether a simple mental activity–having children with low self-confidence say favorable, encouraging words to themselves–could boost their achievement. The study found that children who engaged in this kind of self-talk improved their math performance when the talk focused on effort, not ability. The study was done by researchers at Utrecht University, the University of Applied Sciences Leiden, the University of Amsterdam, and the University of Southampton. It appears in Child Development, a journal of the Society for Research in Child Development. “Parents and teachers are 
often advised to encourage children to repeat positive self-statements at stressful times, such as when they’re taking academic tests,” notes _PERSON_, professor of psychology at Utrecht University, who led the study. “But until now, we didn’t have a good idea of whether this helped children’s achievement. We discovered that children with low self-confidence can improve their performance through self-talk focused on effort, a self-regulation strategy that children can do by themselves every day.” Researchers examined 212 children in grades 4 to 6 (ages 9 to 13 years) from schools in middle-class communities in the Netherlands. They chose this age because in late childhood, negative perceptions of competence on school tasks become increasingly prevalent. The children were instructed to take a math test because math performance is compromised by negative beliefs about one’s competence. In the study, the children first reported their beliefs about their competence. A few days later, they worked in 
their classrooms on the first half of a standardized math test. Immediately after completing the first half of the test, they were randomly assigned to silently take part in either self-talk focused on effort (e.g., “I will do my very best!”), self-talk focused on ability (“I am very good at this!”), or no self-talk. Afterwards, they completed the second half of the math test. Children who took part in self-talk focused on effort improved their performance on the test compared to children who did not engage in self-talk focused on effort. The benefits of self-talk were especially pronounced among children who held negative beliefs about their competence. In contrast, children who engaged in self-talk focused on ability did not improve their math scores, regardless of their beliefs about their competence. “Our study found that the math performance of children with low self-confidence benefits when they tell themselves that they will make an effort,” explains _NAME_, assistant professor of child dev
elopment at the University of Amsterdam, who coauthored the study. “We did not find the same result among children with low self-confidence who spoke to themselves about ability. Self-talk about effort is the key.” The authors note that their findings apply only to children in fourth to sixth grades and may not be applicable to children of other ages. They also note that the study was done in the Netherlands, and that children’s response to self-talk may differ in other countries and cultures."

Nobody who practices something the first few times, get it done easy right away. Even folks just trying meditation early on wont get a quiet mind right away. As a personal experience, I found that meditation during the initial signs of psychosis starting led to keeping me in control of my mind and body. But before that I would just practice meditation during normal times. The big shift happened when I decided to do it during a strong psychosis. The experience was REALLY hard and frightening. But I let the fear exist within me without reacting to it, and now it works every time i feel the onset of an episode. The only remaining physical symptom I have is uncontrollable gut constrictions."

175948816,I will tell you why I ask this question. The effects of meds seem hard to judge person to person. Some people who routinely heard voices can objectively say something along the lines of ‘2 months into meds the voices were 99% gone’. This could be seen as an example of a measurable effect of the meds. People who don’t routinely hear voices seem harder to judge how well the meds are acting. Well in my case certainly. Delusions stick with me 24/7. No med has got rid of them. However I care much less about my strange thoughts than I used to. This may well be the effect of the meds but it’s effect is a lot more nebulous than the presence/absence of voices. Not sure what my point is to be honest. Just makes me think the variety of sz presentations is broad

175948863,"I'm going to first try to answer your question about why.. then get into how this practice is so damaging. People don't understand. We presume to think we understand because we have superficial warning signs from pop culture about what it means to need mental help but it's almost always entirely fictional. We all have problems in our behavior that we desperately seek to resolve but have no clue how to first classify and then seek help to do so. Personally, I have wondered whether I have OCD because I just can't let things go. Especially if I'm interested in figuring something out or even as I attempt to move on to something else, I often find myself fixated and irritably unable to stop worrying about tiny aspects of life that most people don't give a second thought. Is that maybe kinda like OCD? If so it's less compulsive and more obsessive, but all in all it's mostly an aspect of getting out of my own head and setting better priorities.. is what my therapist tries to assure me. But I respect and d
eeply understand the damage it is for me to go around blathering about being OCD, etc. without a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.. to do so further damages the ability of those struggling with it to find the help they need. I'm bipolar and can sometimes be clinically 'crazy' without my medications.. I can tell you exactly what that means in my case, but when I try to inform others in case I one day take things too far, I always get, ""Oh yeah, me too.. everyone's crazy"" - and I'm like, ""No, you don't understand.. not like that.. I'm serious."" etc. It's really no use. They think they know but clearly don't have the slightest clue what it means to lose all touch with reality, and, blissfully, not even realize what's going on. And the cycle continues with everyone thinking they understand when they don't. It's the _PERSON_ effect and more trouble than it's worth to try to fight it. So all we can do is try to not fall into the trap ourselves as we're stumbling throughout our lives trying to be better and g

174339691,"Adjunctive L-Methylfolate Offers Benefit in Depression Treatment Supplemental treatment with the medical food L-methylfolate may benefit patients with depression who do not respond to antidepressants, according to a review article published online in CNS Spectrums. _PERSON_, MD, MPH “L-methylfolate has been well studied in multiple clinical trials, and findings support its consideration for use as an adjunctive therapy in any depression management program, and especially in patients with characteristics suggestive of potential responsiveness,” wrote lead author and Psych Congress cochair _PERSON_, MD, MPH, and colleagues. Believed to enhance the synthesis of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine as well as to suppress inflammation and promote neural health, L-methylfolate is the biologically active form of folate and is available over-the-counter and in a prescription formulation. Supplemental use of L-methylfolate shows particular promise, the article explained, for improving outcomes in pat
ients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant major depressive disorder and the following characteristics: • low folate levels; • mutations in gene-coding enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of folate; • body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2; and • elevated markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein. Conversely, L-methylfolate should be avoided in patients with hypersensitivity to the nutraceutical. Overall, however, L-methylfolate as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder was well tolerated in trials, with a safety profile resembling placebo. The authors recommended use of L-methylfolate be considered in conjunction with other wellness-promoting interventions, such as diet and exercise. “Supplementation with L-methylfolate fits well with the changing paradigm of major depressive disorder management,” they wrote, “with the ultimate goal of producing wellness instead of focusing solely on symptom reduction.” —_PERSON_"

174339707,"This is a big topic for me but seems to be push to the wayside throughout my sons treatment for the past three years since his original psychotic break. Anosagnosia is the inability to recognize or be aware of your own symptoms were illness. It is NOT denial…this is different! This is a big topic because as you all know you can’t fix what is not broken. Cannot help someone who does not want to help themselves. Your reality is your reality, and nobody can tell you what your reality is even if it does not agree with 99% of population. Even if it is self-destructive or dangerous. Even if it puts you in harm’s way or others in harm’s way. Even if it keeps you from forming relationships that used to be the main focus in the pursuit of happiness. I’m just curious is there anyone in here that has experienced this in the peak of their psychosis and did you ever get through it? Did you ever gain insight? Did you ever thank God and your parents and your friends for helping you through that time whe
re you could not see outside your own reality? Or were you always able to see your symptoms? This is important for me to know because I have been helping my son for the past 3 years, and I am wondering if I am ever going to see him again in the way we used to talk and trust. He just sees me now as if he’s drowning and I have a stick and I’m just pushing him down even further instead of throwing him a rope. That is the look in his eyes. That is how she looks at me. He just started on clozapine which is pretty much the last thing they can try to bring him out of his psychosis. Of course he denies hearing voices or paranoia or any other symptom although he sleeps with knives under his pillow and openly admits he is afraid of sharks attacking him in freshwater lakes etc.this is ”normal” he will talk to himself and reference someone that is not there while he is doing it. He will stay awake for days, restless, agitated, unsatisfied. Often laughs to himself… this is what I mean by still being in a psychos
is but if you ask him he doesn’t recognize any of it as being abnormal. He is currently in the hospital involuntarily and has been there the past 8 months. He has a court date today and he called me and asked me to pick him up at the store after he gets released, but in all reality they are planning to sanction him for another hundred and eighty days. I feel so bad if I argue with him he gets angry and hangs up and thinks I am against him. So I just agree. Please help. My son is my best friend, and I wish to gain some insight from those who have experienced the same as him so that I know how to do what’s right for him, so that I can emphathize and advocate for him in the best way possible. Thank you."

Religion is safe, because although it has no evidence to suggest any of it is true, it cannot be proved false. You can't prove a false, but it gives the person something to cling to, an abject thought that can be justified because there's no direct proof that it doesn't. You can't disprove god any more than I can prove that I've never been to Brazil. I can prove if I have been, but I can't prove I've not. It's like people who say they prefer dogs because dogs don't let you down. Dogs can't let you down, because they can't form the complex relationship issues that causes someone to think you're a twat. This is exactly what Schizoid's do; they create a system of thinking that cannot be proved wrong but gives them comfort."

I even ran 3 miles to a church “to claim sanctuary” . I was very deluded and ill - but to me it was normal and i didnt realise what i did was crazy until years later. I was an un-medicated un-diagnosed schizophrenic that got let down for years by the NHS Trust in the UK. They preferred to _NAME_ me and put me in prison instead. _PERSON_ had years of being psychotic without realising it. Its only my current CMHT that picked up on it.

That thing they do with their eyes to act sad when you are sad; their gushing behaviour when they want something. They know you are 'the source' and play upon it. And, they always want MORE. Quite narcissistic really. Never thought I would say it but I think the Love from a cat is more honest. Not that I Love dogs the less. Another thought: According to theory, humans have evolved to be social animals. But surely if we are truly evolving we need to be adapting to being alone, more. We no longer need 'a tribe' for protection or to source, food, shelter, water. So, instead of suggesting everyone get 'out there' and meet others because that is our so called natural disposition, perhaps, if psychologists and other members of society generated a more positive and accepting attitude towards people who are 'alone' in life then those who are alone would feel less inadequate, le

175949070,Lockdown will soon be over _AT_MENTION_. I hope you can get back into your swimming routine. That was a really good practice you had. I’m proud of you.
175949071,hugs. Youre having a tough time…I had a voice asking someone “now what is she doing?”. Might have been asking _NAME_ my voice. I wasn’t doing anything. What kind of voices do you have?

175949076,I ask because I was doing too much exercise and made my anxiety and stuff worse
175949077,Forgive me if I overstep here but is it possible you actually do better with your old pdoc? Sometimes there is a line we can’t see with psychosis so I come to rely heavily on the opinions of those around me...

175949081,Hope you can think of some positives now and that you understood what your husband said and are in peace and feeling better. Three positives for me today. Walked my brothers dogs for 45 minutes. Went to the gym and stayed the whole class even though I kept thinking about leaving and not exercising. Visited my sacred neigh but did not stay more than a few minUtes as she was eating anyway plus it was chilly. When I was with my x boyfriend I didn’t have the whinginess stopping me from doing things and depressing me but since we broke up it’s started again.makes simple tasks huge . Simple tasks are big for me without it but even more so. A part of me finds it funny.that things that torment me and things that tortured me can be funny yet humble and understanding to it. I have not figured it out. Someone is doing it to me but am I letting them? How do I stop them and get emotionally intelligent? My heart and neck hurts and my neck feels twisted. I don’t want to be everyone’s bi tch.i always felt l
ike I was on invisible leash n restrained.i need to be free. That something that tortured me for so many years can be funny later…strange.

175949094,I think it could be something in the metaphysical sense real. I sometimes get a burning sensation in the fingers in my right hand. It started happening around the same time as my 1st psychotic break. Funny enough it is an actual medical condition though. I remember telling a psychiatrist when he asked and had nothing to do with the psychosis. So in my opinion it is most likely real cause I get where you're coming from too.

I know for me it was trauma and drugs. I don’t think it was genetics but rather my birth was a trauma, that set me up for vulnerability and eventually bam schizophrenia and drugs and alcohol made things worse. But now on the right meds I’ve seemed to find a fair balance. I’m still sz cuz I’ve crossed the line of no return but it is manageable now with a band aid called meds."
175949097,Yes I had to offer them doctors notes. I knew what I was doing during this time. But they made it very difficult for me for a while.
175949098,What happened yesterday was very traumatizing for me. I found out through some easy research that this place I had went to is really not a health clinic but one of Texas’s many fake health centers that basically parade as a pregnancy center like planned parenthood. And they really are an anti abortion group. There was no doctors there. The receptionist is the one that talked to me about Jesus. I really felt like idk...just very traumatized by it all. I feel dissociative/depersonalized today because my anxiety is so overwhelmed and overrun. I feel like I’m not here. Like I’m going in and out of this world/reality. This experience may have set me back into an episode or is beginning to.

Anyways, most doctors primary function is to medicate. Medication doesn’t work, I’ve tried a couple dozen different kinds and most have increased my symptoms. Sometimes, I react to medication as I have a lot of allergies. I guess what I struggle with is the complex post traumatic stress disorder. There’s a lot of anxiety and I can feel depressed for no reason. Like why am down today? Nothing has happened. I’m also overly sensitive to what people say.

175949109,"Good Morning, Yes, my doctors know I’m attempting another wean off the Zoloft. I tried this past winter but my daughter had back surgery and it just wasn’t good timing. Originally my psychiatrists recommendation was to stay on it for 6-9 months after surgery as I have no history of anxiety or depression. I would prefer to not switch if I’m able to get off the Zoloft. I have a phenomenal therapist, a strong support system and many tools in place yet I can’t seem to convince myself that I’m capable of living without Zoloft. Or maybe it’s that I don’t know who I am without the Zoloft? My withdrawal symptoms are mostly physical. Severe brain fog and spaciness. Vertigo and dizziness when I workout. There is a part of me that wonders if I’m actually experiencing anxiety while withdrawing or if it’s the thought of being off the meds that’s making me anxious. If that makes any sense! Regardless, I’ve cut down from 100 to 50mg over the course of five weeks. My original therapeutic dose 
after my breakdown (I like to call it my spiritual awakening) was 150mg so I’ve made progress! Anyone have tips or advice that will help with the withdrawal process?"

175949122,Everyone is under varying levels of control from others. It is not bad. It is not reprehensible. Control arises through people providing constraints to you and you acting within those constraints. Without constraints you would be like a feather - influenced by everything that you see/hear/feel. You need to accept these constraints. They form your filters. Which help you filter out the crap and focus on what matters. The feeling of being disempowered (by being conscious of others being in control) can trigger episodes (psychosocial disempowerment - read up on how immigrants have a higher rate of dellusional disorders. And how this rate is lowered if they are within a community within the foreign land of others of their own nationality) To resolve point 2 - you need to become more empowered. The key to this is being open and learning. A good topic to learn is information philosophy.

175949154,"My 21 DD, who also has Intellectual Disabilities, woke up 14 weeks ago today in a full state of psychosis. I had no idea what psychosis even was! She talks to herself ALL day. Initially she did not sleep (4 hrs a night). We took her to psychiatrist, did 2 different rounds of anti-psychotics and had no difference, except she was sick. So we opted for a different route reasoning she must be “treatment resistant”. That said, Here’s where we are. She is currently taking CBD 1000mg. After 400 mark she was sleeping 8 hours a night, now she’s sleeping more like 8-10-which is more normal for her. We’ve also started Niacin moving up and she is currently on 6000mg. This appears to be improving her the most right now. She is not talking to herself as much, but she is still delusional and talks about some odd things, just not as much. After some research I purchased the Amyloban 3399 which was started last night. She is also on a very strict diet-organic, nothing processed, no processed sugar, no glu
ten, no corn, super nutrient rich supplements. I am so glad to have found this site and happy to see REAL people who are talking so openly about this. Any advice, words of wisdom, words of hope would be greatly appreciated."

I even called the cops and explained the situation, they gave me a pamphlet on mental disorders. I didn’t believe it, but I had been discussing my problems with my brother and he looked it up and told me it was probably schizophrenia. He took me to the hospital where I was diagnosed. He probably saved my life… anyway after I was diagnosed I calmed down knowing what was afflicting me and started taking the meds they prescribed me.

175949175,"Hi _NAME_, ""I have run out of options in this life."" Are you sure you know all your options? Are you receiving any benefits you're qualified for? If you don't have a job you may qualify for State Medicaid benefits like a monthly amount for food and possibly medical benefits. There are places to live where your rent is based on your income. I would call Public Housing and see what they have to say. Mine is based on my income. I've lived here 12 years and couldn't find a cheaper place to live if I wanted to. What about public transportation? Is there a bus service where you live? It was my only way to work for a while, by 11pm it was shut down and a 20 block walk home for me when I got off. There is an OATS bus here you can make an appointment for that some people use as a ride to work or the store. Are you eligible for Social Security Disability? If your mental status is effecting your ability to hold down a job or carry out daily life activities I would pursue it. There is no shame in mental illn
ess and playing it down like it's not all that bad is what you do not want to do if going for SSD. The shame is if there are services available that could make life better for you and you're not taking advantage of them. There are lawyers who will take a case on a contingency basis where they only get paid if you win, if they think you have a case, then a small portion of what is awarded you. That would be the answer to your problems on several levels. I filed twice and was turned down twice. Then I got a local lawyer who took over, won my case and it was the answer to most of mine. I have Medicare, Medicaid and a Medicare Part D plan to help cover prescription cost. Xifaxan, one of my meds, has a retail price of $2690 for a bottle of 60 which lasts a month. My copay, and all I pay, is approximately $8. I don't pay for anything when I go to the doctor or have a procedure done at the hospital and don't expect a bill. I get a monthly SSD check based on what was paid into my account while working, and I worked a 
lot. My monthly check isn't what I would make in 2 weeks working 12 hours a day on my last real job, but I live within my budget and comfortably.

I can understand your concern, but who really knows you here? This is a depression forum and there are no doubt people who will be able to relate personally to your experiences or struggles. If talking about it might take some stress off you now would be the time to do it. I will talk about mine, ramble on more than I should, and have already spilled the beans on myself. Less people can likely relate to or agree with the things I say, but that's the least of my worries. I do hope you saw some options you hadn't been aware 
of or already receiving and that things start looking up for you."

175949202,"This might be harsh but… is there an instrument that gives you more bang for your buck? Have you thought about learning the keyboard? You can play with a lot of musical tones with a keyboard, and I understand it might not be what you want, but they are readily available and people are always getting rid of an old model for a newer one. If music is your passion I wouldn’t say to just think of one instrument as a vehicle for that. I like art, but I’ve sculpted ( I actually think now that sculpting might be one of the most fun to just play with casually) and I started off strictly drawing, then I learned to paint a little. Then I found sculpting and I found so much enjoyment out of it, and I didn’t expect it to be so fun. If you play an instrument already, and really feel passionate about it, obviously go for it, but I reckon you could do just as well by branching out and trying other instruments to see if you’re not missing some really fun ways to engage with sound. I feel though that hones

174339765,"this “disability secrets” website is great at giving straight dope easy to understand advice for those getting or trying to get disability benefits. they gave some conflicting advice though regarding how much one could work… “This SGA limit allows many disability recipients to do some part-time work. For example, if you were to work 16 hours a week making $16 per hour, your monthly income would be about $1,100, which falls under the SGA amount. As long as you haven’t improved enough medically to work full time (since you were approved for benefits), you should be able to continue receiving benefits.” www.disabilitysecrets.com What Are the Rules for Working While on Social Security Disability? "" If you return to work while receiving SSDI benefits, the SSA will want to determine if you are engaging in “substantial gainful activity” (SGA). The biggest factor in determining if work qualifies as SGA is the amount a person is paid. In 2020, someone is generally considered to be engaging 
in SGA if he or she earns more than $1,260 ($2,110 for blind SSDI recipients) So, for example, if you are making, say, $200 per week doing part-time work, you would not be working over the SGA limit. However, this isn’t a cut and dry issue. If you are working a lot, it’s possible for the SSA to determine that your job duties constitute SGA even if you are earning less than the SGA amount."" www.disabilitysecrets.com What Will Cause Your Social Security Disability Benefits to Stop? 16 bucks an hour times 16 hours per week, is more than two hundred per week. so their advice is shake-y. to be clear, these arent contradictions, but it does call into question how social security would view a schizophrenic working a lot, but under the ‘substantial gainful activity’ amount. the sixteen hours per week thing is also misleading, cause in weeks where there are five work weeks, a person working that much would be over the limit. i dont know why the site would even bother stating that example, as it’s such a sim

175949233,"I get it. I really do. I like to write, and I am lucky if I post a story and even get one comment saying “nice story.” But here’s the thing. You can’t force someone to engage with your work. A person can’t choose to identify with the things you create. It either happens organically, or it doesn’t happen at all. If you make people feel obligated to respond positively to your creations, you will start to alienate people from your work. So try to just enjoy the rare paragraph, knowing it is truly genuine. You don’t want hundreds of fake comments of praise, because then you will never know when the praise is sincere. Look up coping skills for rejection sensitive dysphoria.

175949307,"^No problem. We're on a mental illness forum, after all While I still strongly suspect that this virus (some say engineered, some not) may have been deliberately released by the CDC (considering its timing) to give _PERSON_ ""the bird"" for cutting their funding, what I'm really asking is for people to step back and at least consider a few things: The fact that a statement appears in graphical or numerical form does not inherently make it ""science"". Anyone can make a mathematical model of anything. Even _PERSON_ can make a graph (or have someone make one for him). However, such a model is only as dependable as its underlying idea and design, the data used, and, ultimately, the care and exactness of those who developed it. And brand names, such as Harvard and Oxford, are no guarantee of quality work. Frequently, the more capable the scientist, the humbler, and the more likely to state the limitations of their hypotheses. I haven't seen many of ""the experts"" on COVID-19 advertise the limitations 
of their projections, when, to be credible, they should be doing exactly that. This is not the first time humans have tried to trump natural forces (regardless of a virus's origin, arguably its progress will defy human orchestration). Human intervention has often exacerbated things. We, as a species are control freaks, and appear to feel entitled to controlling everything in our path. The post-industrial world is too convenient. For the most part, we have minimal exposure to the ultimate realities of life: soil, grass, sunshine, physical pain, childbirth, disease, and death. For example, to what degree is our obsession with antibiotics responsible for the success of antibiotic-resistant disease strains (as we know, this doesn't apply to viruses, which are not living things)? And now, we believe that, by hiding in the house, under something disquietingly close to martial law, we can avoid sickness and death. For the elderly (although she's ~77, not _NAME_), those with compromised immune systems, and those with 
pre-existing conditions, that may well be the case, but no one, except maybe _NAME_ and that _PERSON_ guy after whom _PERSON_ might have been modeled, lives forever. A small number of politicians, academics, investors, and others have MADE A KILLING OFF OF THIS ""PANDEMIC"" already. More than a few small businesses will not survive it. The economic ramifications of what I consider to be the overreaction to COVID-19 will far outweigh the aftermath of the virus alone. And, as we know, the already moneyed grossly enriched themselves from the Great Depression, at the expense of just about everybody else. Unprecedented global control of the human population is being mandated. And we are being monitored throughout. To me, that is far scarier than disease and death."

175949312,Hi So I’m at 14 years without an admission. I had a year at home plus section and diagnosis age 18 2 x six week stays age early twenties and then a half an half in and out of hospital over 3 years after an attempt to come off meds. Not doing that again. I’m 45 now haven’t been psychotic for longer than a few hours a time or maybe at difficult stressful times I go a little bit for a week or so I feel at a crossroads Do I celebrate and think here’s to the next 15? Or try to put a price on it with private insurance in UK. This is difficult I haven’t enquired but would expect it to eat a hell of a lot of my partner and my finances… during a time where we are just at the last bit before needing to think about old age too much I’m sorry if this is inappropriate in any way. I just want to hear from people who have a long term recovery. Because the NHS have no beds. The situation when I was last in hospital they had already closed the secure ward where I would have needed to stay Care in the c
ommunity is all I could ever get again on NHS if I become unwell ever again. Just not an inpatient system now. Their drive to keep people out of hospital has worked while I’m well and get their support but at an acute timer 2 people would call rounded for 20 mins and watch me take a dissolvable antipsychotic. At the time that med was giving me tongue and eye rolling and seizing over to the side as I had these severe dystonic reactions with the med After 3 toxic years finished with 288 days in one stretch in hospitals do had been give. The med I take still I’ve been fine for 14 years

175949340,I took my AD and AP last night and this morning. I feel shaky. I feel a little fragile and vulnerable. The shakiness is a little better since I took some anti-anxiety medication this morning but it's not gone. I'm trying to breathe deeply and settle my core. I see PDOC tonight. I'm not sure what he is going to be able to do. I'm at the highest dose of the AD and the highest dose of the AP for depression. I was having hallucinations of spiders. That seems to have settled. I feel kind of dissociated and out of it. Hence the feeling fragile. Maybe PDOC can add a mood stabilizer or another AD. IDK. I'm worried he is going to say there is nothing else he can do.
175949341,I would try taking the increased dose. Test it out for a week or so. You have nothing to lose.

Afterwards, I joined the volunteer Fire Department on Main Street(it didnt work out but I quit elegantly I believe and can back it up.) I also spent a lot of money on ballroom dance lessons at a studio not far away on Main Street. I learned that _NAME_’s song where he croons “I simply love you; more than I love life itself”, (which is a Foxtrot I think), is the capturing and or embodiment of my relationship with love.

174339783,"When I first got diagnosed in 1980 my mom found a support group for me. I don’t remember much about it but after it was over one day I was talking to one of the women who led it and she asked how was I getting home. I told her I was catching a bus and she was really surprised and said, “Wow, you’re really high functioning”. And that in turn surprised me because I didn’t think catching a bus was a big deal, I did it all the time without thinking twice about it. My functioning has fluctuated over the years. Even when I am employed I go through stages where I function better than other times. I went through stages years ago where I had bad agoraphobia and didn’t want to leave the house for any reason except to work. It was so bad that I was afraid to go to the mechanic when my car needed work. I remember when I was broke when I was in my mid twenties and every penny counted and I had rented a VCR and when it came time to return it I couldn’t force myself to drive to the store where I ren
ted it to return it and racked up $5.00 a day late fees for more than a week. I’ve always managed to function just enough to take care of myself. Even when I isolate I still go to work, shop for food, make appointments and keep them, run every necessary errand, attend family events, see my therapists. Maybe this an oxymoron but during the years I was in my crack addiction in lots of ways I could say I was high functioning. I had to have my crack so I was walking or driving all over town on the spur of the moment to get drugs, I was meeting and partying with strangers all the time. I was going into crack houses and staying all night partying. I ended up at parties where I knew no one. My friends would regularly come to my house at 1:00 am and wake me to go to clubs or bars. I walked miles at night to get drugs. And then in 1990 I got clean and had some very productive years and I was catching busses every day to got to and from work. I was eating out at restaurants frequently by myself, I was catching buses 
or walking 5 or 6 times a week to go to AA, CA and NA meetings. I was spending weekends at my sisters house with her husband and their friends."

I also do clozapine as well… I had tardive dyskinesia and it was very uncomfortable while I was on the bus or even at classes… Long story short, I gave up on abilify and started again risperidone and since I have some trouble sleeping and started to feel more depressed my doc prescribed me agomelatine which is great for sleeping and depressive disorders.

After I took an anti-depressant, I wasn't depressed and I didn't feel tired. So you say all you have is anxiety, and I hope you're taking something for it. But you also may be depressed which could be causing the tiredness. Again, the net says signs of depression include: ""Feeling sad or having a depressed mood; Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed; Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting; Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much; Loss of energy or increased fatigue."" You've said you have two of those, ""sleeping too much"" and ""loss of energy."" Are you also depressed? Do you have a good attitude and feel you'll get out of this? A lot of this problem could be attitudinal. Deep down you don't think you're going to get out of this, and you're not really looking for an answer. You could be keeping yourself from that."

175949530,"One of the more embarrassing and therefore less talked about aspects of mental illness is the difficulty in keeping up with your personal hygiene, particularly if you are going through a period of depression. Depression makes it hard to function Depression saps away your energy; it can make it difficult to function on so many levels. It can be tough on really bad days to even get out of bed, and I think people who haven’t been through it don’t always realize that it isn’t just because you’re feeling so low. It’s a very physical, heavy feeling that you can go through, which I sometimes describe as feeling as though you are trying to move through thick jelly or walk through water. It feels as though you are weighed down, and this is very much a physical symptom. It’s hard to keep up with hygiene On really bad days it can be tough to even get out of bed, never mind shower, brush your teeth, wash your hair, put on clothes and walk around in the world.

175949535,"So sorry to hear I feel sorrow for you I was just telling Door that the way I was feeling today had me thinking about how I’m supposed to be the adult at 30 (as I had asked my mom to come see about me today cuz I was in so much physical pain and she said “just goto sleep”) but i never ever feel like an adult in my life in general. If I have a kid I have to take care of that kid, which isn’t an issue, it’s just the feeling like ‘I’m the parent now. They come to me for everything like I did my dad and mom’ and I think that’s what scares me. Cuz like who takes care of me when I need help or am sick? No one really anymore when it comes to sickness. I constantly feel like even tho I’m here living alone with a fiancé and my own place, bills, responsibilities, etc, I feel like not an adult. I constantly feel like this is all temporary and I’ll be going back to my dads sooner or later. And other than the concern for my dads health, I think that’s why I fear him passing away. Is bec
ause, once he’s gone I truly don’t feel like I’ll have anybody and that scares me to death. That’s all I can think about some days. Just wanted to tell a bit of a story there. But yea. I empathize with you and a sympatize. Here if you need to talk."

175949542,Thank you so much for your kind response. I do believe in my heart of hearts I have an underlying health condition that is being missed. I also believe I need to find the right doctor I’m just getting so frustrated with all the bad ones and the ones who say they don’t know how to help me. That is probably the worst thing you can say to someone especially someone who feels as helpless as I do. I will keep trying though for my daughters sake. Thank you ?

I’d probably stay active in some kind of part-time business, and when people asked me what I did, I’d refer to that business. If I ended up with hundreds of millions of dollars, or something, people might figure out that my little business couldn’t support my lifestyle. Then, yes, many people would probably be jealous, just as they are of many rich people."

For me it is working pretty well. (But I’ve only been on it a few days) In terms of dealing with it without medication? You need to find something that gives you happiness. You really do. That’s all there is. Maybe music? Maybe films or tv? Maybe a job or occupation that gives you fulfilment? I’m not sure. You need something to live for though.

You've come far from then.. I don't know how you handle the stress - It's like my mom.. Somehow you don't use a crutch from what I know of like drugs or anything - Maybe buying things with your excited mood. For me, I don't get excited much most times.. Or I do? I get excited about something and then it quickly fades.. Eventually you'll be super financially stable it just takes time.. Good relationship and you're not controlling but more of an inward frustration with him which is harmless and loving. Nice place like gaming TV room to relax and focus. Work is hell sometimes and getting up on time.. I can barely do it. What I've realized is that once I force myself to wake up early, I'm awake throughout the rest of the day. I remember being so tired working at oil rigs. I would sleep in the passenger seat on the way there, while 
I was supposed to work and then on the way back (Cuz of the meds). I honestly think that schizophrenia or psychosis can fade with time.. We just break.. It's like a bad trip.. You grow from it. I know many people that have broke. All those things that my psych ward friends said.. Horrible things have happened to them.. Or it's just like some journey of being terrified and an important chosen one due to isolation and madness. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and then tripped balls. I'm completely fine now... Although more awake.. I don't know what is happening - But I'm catching up to your mental state if not already there. You can do it. You need support. I'm not the best person to talk about stress because I cope in horrible ways. You're much better at it than me. You're strong minded - Little psychosis seeping through but I know it won't get to you as bad as it did anymore - Same with myself - Just because it can't get any worse than what we've been through.

174339851,"You’re reaching man. My post acknowledged that lobotomies are still done in some countries, but they are a very small minority. It doesn’t prove anything. Some places they still do exorcisms. Voodoo is still practiced in some countries and so is witchcraft. Both of them are looked at as akin to religions by many people. People believe in weird stuff, and do stuff that is looked upon by most people as archaic and outdated and dangerous. I’ll keep saying it, there’s good reasons why lobotomies are not widely done still. Living with treatment resistant schizophrenia is bad but how good would your quality of life be living as a vegetable? _AT_MENTION_ made a good point. Basically, just because we are schizophrenic doesn’t mean our life is over. Look around at the positive stories, look at the accomplishments of people with schizophrenia.

174339848,"Hey that’s good news. Adjunctive treatment with the atypical antipsychotic pimavanserin ( Nuplazid , Acadia Pharmaceuticals) is associated with significant improvement in patients with schizophrenia who have predominantly negative symptoms, new research suggests The randomized placebo-controlled trial included 403 stable schizophrenia outpatients with predominant negative symptoms who were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily pimavanserin (n = 201) or placebo (n = 202) as an adjunct to current antipsychotic treatment . A greater improvement in the NSA-16 total score compared with placebo was observed in the patients who received the highest pimavanserin dose of 34 mg (–11.6 vs –8.5; unadjusted P = .0065, effect size = 0.34). OK, but not a real large effect size. Pimavanserin was well tolerated with high completion rates of approximately 86% in both the pimavanserin and placebo groups, and similar rates of adverse events between pimavanserin (39.8%) and placebo (35.1%). The most freq
uent adverse events were headache (6.5% pimavanserin, 5% placebo) and somnolence (5.5% pimavanserin, 5% placebo). Serious adverse events, reported as worsening of schizophrenia, occurred in 2% of patients on pimavanserin and 0.5% of patients on placebo.

The most annoying one is a voice of a guy who is scared and begging me to go back inside the house because he’s scared of being outside. This happens sometimes when I step outside during a cigarette. The instinct is to get angry at it and argue that nobody has the right to tell me not to leave my own house, but instead I have to just calmly remind myself that there’s not a real person screwing with me, and I pretend the voice isn’t happening.

My work offered healthcare plans but they cost money every month so I didn’t get a plan and just bank the extra cash. But I still have Tricare for Life with medicare so I never pay any copays. And I can still use Tricare for all my prescriptions which is much better than Medicare part D. I got my CPAP machine and all my supplies through my insurance. I should have gotten that through the VA. I had a copay of $500 for the CPAP machine but I didn’t get diagnosed with sleep apnea until after I got out of the military so I don’t have a VA rating for it but I am already at 100 percent disabled so there is no way I am putting in another claim and risk losing that.

174339858,"Hi, I’m Alyss, I was wondering if anyone here identified as fictionkin, fictionkin is a type of otherkin which itself derives from the therian community. Fictionkin is when you identify as a fictional character for either coping/psychological reasons, or spiritually, in the case of spiritual fictionkin, you believe by some means, be it the multiverse theory, past lifes, or something else, that you have the soul of a fictional character. _PERSON_ sometimes also experience memories from their ‘canons’/past life from their respective source material/ alternate universe, these memories can be auditory, feeling, visual, or a combination of these. I happen to identify as fictionkin, i get memories from this past life i have thats not quite the same as a past life that takes place in this Earth’s past. My memories that ive ‘recovered’(?) Have been auditory, feeling and visual, the majority have been auditory with over 50 auditory memories, I’m schizophrenic and hear voices, but the auditory 
memories i’ve had do not sound the same as the normal voices i hear, i would hear them along the lines of a hypnogogic hallucination plus sometimes getting memories in dreams, basically i would only hear a sentence or two or more from someone from this past life, or even here my past selfs voice in the form of a memory. The auditory memories sound clearer like external voices from other people compared to the voices i do hear who have been quieter than that ever since i was put on respiridone about 3 years ago, ive since changed ap, my voices/spirits are the same volume still. The actual voices i hear only rarely get as clear and loud as a normal persons voice. Also the auditory memories would have details or differences from the canon of the source material. Such as one person being transgender when their character in the story wasnt and two of them being siblings when they werent in canon/story. A big part of why i even found out i was a spiritual fictionkin is because the voices/spirits i do hear, they a
re intelligent and purpose driven and have been trying to teach me things ever since i first started hearing them a bit over 3 years ago by using numerous ‘scenarios’ (they seem to be mostly done with the snenarios now i think), my voices/spirits basically kept hinting at this past life for at least maybe two years before i finally experienced an identity shift/awakening and started experiencing memories. Another big reason why I actually believe that im fictionkin is because one of the main voice/spirit i hear everyday, and who has a special bond with me, like a neural and emotional bond, whose been with me since the beginning of me hearing voices experienced a change too when i first had my identity shift they had one too, it turns out that theyre apparently the character whom i kin’s friend and companion, the two characters literally share a body and brain, though the friend and companion can come partially come out of my kin character, and they can do the same with me, i can feel this particular voi
ce/spirit come out of my body partially, i guess you might call that a tactile hallucination (i feel tactile sensations from the voices/spirits all day every day not during sleep), i can somewhat sense their body which i cant do for the others who i feel tactiley and externally, i’ve given him water and felt it be drinked by him, no i didnt just pour water, he can drink from a bowl and ill feel the water go down his body, my back will feel colder, and feel him gain a little weight, he weighs some automatically already, and when ive shared a little food with him i can feel him chewing and licking it, and getting a tiny bit of something from it, the food visibly has no bitemarks but well gets colder, but it sometimes tastes different after he gets what he does from it, it personally feels satisfying and enjoyable for him to ‘eat’ and drink. (Very important, me and him share a body, so he gets the majority of his energy and nutritional needs from just me eating and drinking water).He also feels slightly he
avier and denser when i/we take a shower and hes out. Also I can feel my friends invisible body and the outline of it, its like he has some density to him. I feel other voices/spirits externally too and they have weight and density to them too. My friend also takes the shape of my kin characters companion too, he doesnt take the form of a human. Generally has a simmilar personality, but is more polite than his depiction. The character i kin has also been one of personal signifigance ever since i first saw the show as a teenager, ive only recently read the complete manga series. I had no intention of identifying as them and kinning them before the voices/spirits i hear and live with kept hinting at me having a past life and in particular as this character/person over a couple years, then experiencing an identity shift and my closest voice/spirit friend experiencing a change too, and actually feeling him as my kin character’s companion and living with him like this. Im not out about this to anyone in my perso
nal life, i havent told my therapist about this yet, ive only talked about this in the friendly nontoxic fictionkin community I go to online. And now im talking about this here, the kin community i go to has zero discussion from or about people who are fictionkin and are schizophrenic, i do not think that the majority of fictionkin are schizophrenic at all. So my question is, is there anyone here whose both schizophrenic and identifies as fictionkin, perferably spiritually, though coping/psychological kin are fine too, if so would you mind sharing your experiences and feelings about the subject. In general what do you all think about fictionkin, and the idea of having an identity shift and varying levels of personality shifts. What do you think about the memories me and other fictionkin experience. What do you think about the idea of one’s voices identifying as or claiming to be someone from fiction. I think that might be all, thank you for reading, please dont be too harsh."

So I figure I’m sort of stuck not working if I want to stay symptom free. Since I’ve come to that conclusion I’ve actually become happier, less guilty. I tried to go back to work, but things just didn’t work out. So now I just try to find ways to enjoy my free time the best I can. I take a high dose of antidepressant, and that helps a lot."

174339863,In my city they have mixed senior/disabled housing.
175949634,For at least 30 years I have had Telepathy delusions some are pretty harmless but at time they can get threatening. I do my best to try to not believe in them but sometimes I get attached to some of these mind reading voices. For 5 or 6 years I have had the C.I.A. in my mind doing thought broadcasting. They were threatening and I kind of felt protected by them. But the last 3 weeks one of the CIA voices that I hear split off from the group and now wants to kill me. I have been paranoid about it and heve been looking of ways to up security in my apartment and computer. I got a security camera some things to secure my door. But all the research I did for defending my computer from an expert hacker like a CIA agent is completely impossible. I studied up on all hacking defenses and found that there is always a counter measure. Whats worse is I found that the password to log on a computer is absolutely useless. I found that anyone can get through a log in password by using a technique that can get throug
h it in about 15 minutes. I have spent a lot of time trying to defend myself. I have been very scared to just go out because I keep thinking the CIA are coming to kill me. I’ve been telling myself why would the CIA want to kill me? Who am I and how would I be a target? I am no threat to national security… I’m no danger to society. so why would they want to kill me? I have been doing confirmation bias by thinking things are evidence that the CIA is after me. Like for example I had a car follow me all they way to my apartment and it even pulled into my apartment driveway. That alarmed me. So last night I said “Look I am suffering here and I need to do something about it.” The main problem… The big issue here is I’m believing that thought broadcasting exists. So I sat down at my computer and looked up research that proved or disproved that telepathy exists. My research showed that about 95% of the research I looked at said that Telepathy does not exist. The 5% that I looked at that said telepathy e
xisted wasn’t very reliable to accept. I looked at Research that started in 1890 all they way up to like 2009. Also I needed to accept that many Schizophrenics think the CIA is out to get them. I included. Then I looked back in my past. Once a long time ago I had what was one of the most real telepathic experience where I thought my mind was connected with a woman who I really liked. During this connection she saw some of the thinsg I went through during psychotic episodes and thought I was a complete freak. In my mind she spat at me and I literally felt it hit my face. The next day I thought her family members wanted to find me and kill me. Weeks later I eMailed her and asked her if she experienced any kind of psychic connection with me. She said NO and she had no problems with me. So there is evidence that thought broadcasting does not exist. So I am now focusing on trying not to believe in Telepathic communication. It’s a little hard because it is an almost constant thing in my mind… I have a voice o
f somekind that is in my mind claiming to be someone. And like I said I sometimes get a little attached to them because they can be friendly at times. But I have experienced that friendly voices can turn on you in the future. So Im struggling with trying to convinve myself that telepathy is just not real.
175949635,Does anybody else have delusions that are intricate and seem to have a theme. My are of a religious nature and made me convert to Christianity its like god was communicating with me. But I have started to see some cracks in my delusion and it has made me reevaluate all my beliefs and thoughts.

He has chronic pain, which is something I dont envy about him. Try to look at it like everyone has their trials and tribulations, so when you’re feeling envious or sad of one thing a person has, you can think “but they also deal with this problem, so I’m not going to be envious of their small blessing to eat what they want.” I adopt that attitude and it helps."

174339872,"hi _AT_MENTION_ welcome, I’m new here too. My advice is too see a psychiatrist if therapy does not improve your symptoms. I wasted years in therapy suffering from psychotic symptoms, anguish, insomnia & rage. No-one ever suggested I see a pdoc. When I finally did, the anti-psychotics prescribed helped so much I was able to get back into employment after 7 years unemployment. My brother had a drug-induced psychosis from weed when he was 20. He’s now in his late 40’s & schizophrenic. I am too, I smoked weed thru my teenage years, I stopped when it made me too fearful & scared."

175949667,Is Moral Nihilism A Form Of Dissociation / Stockholm Syndrome? | My PTSD Forum Careful triggering
175949668,"The point I tried to stress was the interdependence of the two. I’d imagine that goals are not set for their own sake (except perhaps as a desperado heroic move, or as a stoic-style consolatio) but that they are dependant on certain assumptions about our moral universe and our place in it. At the very least, it strikes me as psychologically implausible that we’d be able to successfully set goals withour appealing to some form of transcendant sanction (however weak and postmetaphysical). I agree, but there are some interesting possibilities worth considering.If your name happens to be Edipus, and you believe in fate and are indeed told what your fate entails, and naturally you come to reject it, (this was before incest porn obviously), could you embrace your fate -and in a sense, truly fulfil it- precisely by fighting against it? Obviously there are much mundane everyday examples of this predicament. I think we’d need to spend time defining and refining terms to even know whether we disagree o
r not. I say let’s agree to agree!"

175949683,Low food map diet! I was severely constipated and would sometimes just go once a week or so… I went to my old gp and at first I was on five movicol a day but that sucked drinking so much of it but it did help a bit . What helped me the most may be when she put me on a gluten free and lactose free diet. I came off the laxatives and was having daily bowel movement or every second day but mostly daily. The improvement was astounding. I cheat a bit with my diet and at the moment I have not had such regular bowel movements but I have been sick for a month or so and am going to see my new gp about it in a few days and maybe have tests taken. I am in constant pain and discomfort but around the bladder area etc. Talk to your Dr about a low food map diet.its gluten free and dairy free. I buy gluten free bread and I buy soy milk but I do cheat a bit sometimes.

Another person I know told me that I was obsessed with my dogs as well so I deleted my profile picture to make them believe that I’m not obsessed with them. I just like my dogs…they’re cute and lovely just the way they are. Am I not allowed to love my dogs? Or am I being obsessed with them? I’m thinking of cutting all human interactions because I just can’t deal with people anymore. I can’t deal with what’s around me. I just want to do my own thing in peace without getting my happiness disturbed. I want to isolated myself from everyone. People don’t like the way I do things so I just to isolate and stop talking to people.

I think it was something like ‘practicing using my senses’? I feel like a conglomerate of individual bodies melded with foreign ones, hostile ones. There are so many swirling emotions in me. Disgust with my flaws being very high among them. I’m weary of even talking about it in case people try and comfort me into thinking that functioning at the level I do is alright when I need to be trying harder to be worth something. I CAN do better, I am OBLIGATED to The only way I can get a glance sometimes is to look at the journals I’ve kept over the years and mark the consistencies. I am really very lost.

175949738,I guess I’m lucky I didn’t gain much weight from my meds. I’ve been on Zyprexa 20 years and I only gained 20 lbs. I was 180 when I started now I’m 200. I use to lift weights a lot so the extra 20 lbs fits my frame. I do consume an unhealthy amount of sugar. I drink a ton of coffee with sugar and I eat a lot of junk. I eat what ever I want. I quit putting sugar in my coffee for a couple months and I lost 10 lbs. I hate drinking coffee without sugar so I went back. Coffee to me is like crack cocaine.

175949751,"I think you should try being self-employed, as you can make your own rules and choose what jobs you do and don’t. If you’re starting from where you are now, you have nothing to lose. Could be something simple as gardening if you enjoy being outside. Here you can earn about £15-20 per hour doing that. Some customers have their own equipment as well, so you could find those people, and you won’t have to buy all the tools. Just an idea. You could try internet work? My cousin works for a company I think called office angels, and she is basically a self employed work from home receptionist and admin assistant for companies that pass the work on. There are countless things you can try. I hope you find fulfilment in something new. Myself, I have just come out of a salaried position for the last 6 years I could not cope with anymore, and since March I have been building driveways and patios for people I know. I am going to start a Nursing course in September. Confidence is key. I lost my confidence

That has nothing to do with your situation but for me I stilll have regrets about not being able to take a pill to get me to sleep through that hell. Anyways moving on, I don’t think this is drug seeking behavior. When I realized klonopin was the best thing for my anxiety in addition to my other meds. My pdoc gave me 30 mg and it had to last me four weeks. Even me the addict I am said “I can’t abuse this because I need it. I can’t go a day without it. My anxiety is so bad. So the only way to make it last is take it as prescribed.” And if you’re giving your mom it it’s worth a try. I take .25 daily and I’m allowed up to an additional .75 in prn. I never abuse it any more it’s helpful. You shouldn’t be stuck on suffering mode. Although if you start doing anything addict-like behavior then you should tell your mom and doc right away. Not everyone’s 
as fortunate enough an addict as me for klonopin to have a very low potential for abuse, to go along with great medical properties. Good luck you’re a good guy. I hope for the best for you"

174339899,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The association between family dysfunction and admission to an acute mental health inpatient unit: a prospective study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Irish journal of psychological medicine , Sep 2019 12 With the shift from deinstitutionalization to community care in mental health services, relatives of persons with severe and enduring mental illnesses have had to take over the role as primary caregivers. Disturbed family dynamics have been observed within families with an 'ill' member. Although schizophrenia and related mental illnesses are biologically based disorders, environmental stress (including stress within family relationships) plays a major role in the onset and maintenance of symptoms. With this study, we assume that family dynamics play a central role in the course of severe psychiatric illness and hypothesized that dysfunction within family systems is a prognostic indicator of hospitalization in the course of schizophrenia/bipolar and schizoaf
fective disorders.Prospective, observational cohort study evaluating family functioning of 121 patients (schizophrenia/bipolar and schizoaffective disorder) from community at baseline and followed-up over 12-month period after recruitment. Measurements included demographics, diagnosis, Family Assessment Device - General Functioning, Perceived Criticism Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning and Social Support Questionnaire-6.Significant differences found between patients admitted and not admitted during the 12-month time period for age (p = 0.003), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; p = 0.026), Family Assessment Device - General Functioning (FAD-GF; p = 0.007) and Social Support Questionnaire total satisfaction level (p = 0.042) at baseline. Bivariate analysis showed that those admitted into hospital were younger with a higher BPRS score, less social satisfaction and disturbed family dynamics. FAD-GF (p = 0.006) and age (p = 0.022) were significant independent predictors fo
r admission.This provides further evidence supporting importance of promoting better family functioning through modified family dynamics, integrating and involving family into the care of such patients."

It means that,the hallucination is a psychological self for a person (not from the human race) in a free state does not have his own biological body or existential appearance that can be seen with the human naked eyes !

175949860,"Hello witisu...I just returned because while I was writing to you I received something from a friend of mine that may possibly be a good read for you. I copy it here for you: ""Did You See the Star?” How many of you looked for (what’s called) the Bethlehem Star last Monday just after _USER_ID_? Did you see it? Or maybe you saw it another night. This was an amazing phenomenon. For the first time in 800 years this star came into view for the naked eye to see (at least to some people). When things come along once in a lifetime, it’s pretty exciting. Think about it – just another December night in _NAME_, Dallas, Powder Springs and wherever you live in the State of _NAME_ and beyond. A normal, ordinary night in the area where you and I live, for a few hours, the ordinary became extraordinary. The only thing that was different was a bright star shining above the horizon in the Southwest – but it caught the attention of people far and wide. “Did you see the star,” will the topic of many con
versations for days after. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the sheep in the field centuries ago, and certainly nothing about the shepherds themselves. But, on this otherwise ordinary night – something extraordinary happened. Suddenly, the Bible tells us, there was a glow. The glory of God Himself shone around these shepherds, and an angel appeared with a message of GOOD NEWS!! Everything about that night was changed and what happened that night gave HOPE to every human being that was born before or since. What was very ordinary became EXTRA-ordinary! A night of miracles! A supernatural moment in history never seen before or since. On that night the angels announced the birth of a Savior to the shepherds. God’s love for us became EXTRA-ordinary! You and I are just simple, ordinary people, yet God loves each of us with His EXTRA-ordinary love. This incredible love is still available for us today, made available through His Son, Jesus. Have you experienced God’s love in your heart? When you do, 
something EXTRA-ordinary will take place in your life."" Pastor _PERSON_"

175949885,"Do you have an important decision that you have to make in the near future? When I have a decision to make about whether I should or shouldn't do something, I often write down my ideas on paper. I'll write down the pros and cons of doing something. For example, if I have a decision to make about getting a new apartment, I'll write down the pros of getting a new apartment, as well as the cons of getting a new apartment. The two reasons I like to write down the pros and cons on paper are because, for one, if I come up with an idea, I won't forget it if I have it written down. And two, I find that I sometimes come up with ideas that I otherwise wouldn't have thought of if I hadn't written them down. So if you have a decision to make, maybe writing the pros and cons down on paper before finally making the decision like I often do could really help you like it can with me."

175949915,_PERSON_ (a x boyfriend of mine)and I met at a psychiatric hospital. We were in there for quiet a long time and he took care of me and in the beginning they would not let me leave with anyone but after a while I was aloud out with him. He is the one person that got me to exercise such as do bike riding with him n rollerblading. Unfortunately he seems to want nothing to do with me now (like my other friends I once had)but I see him as one of my closest and hold him high. He was so good to me. He helped me but I could not help him. He took me to lake or public pool for a dip to feel better and he was very generous and bought me pizza. I want to be friends with him but he does not answer my texts so what can I do… I met some really nice people in psychiatric hospitals. Although we did not become friends they were very nice and it was helpful just saying a hello to each other or playing table tennis together etc I made at least one friend at a day centre for mentally disabled and when I started cafe w
ork a few hours a week one of the girls I worked with said I’m her best friend but she doesn’t seem to want anything to do with me anymore either. I don’t have any friends it seems. I hope to make friends in the future. Somehow and get back my friends who left me. There is a day centre half a hour from where I live but it’s only opened once a week and it’s only for those going back to work. I like to think I have friends in spirit but in person I don’t have any friends at all it seems. The woman I am interested in romantically does not have a mental illness what I know. My last x does not have a mental illness nor do others I have been with so I have been with both mentally disabled and non disabled.

175949943,"I have been on meds that caused such severe hunger I could never satisfy it no matter how much I ate. I felt like my stomach was the grand canyon. Meds affect everyone differently, the one that made me the most hungry didn’t make a friend of mine hungry at all. There are anti psychotics that don’t cause hunger created in the past thirty years. I never understood why psychiatrists don’t prescribe them more, they could be bribed by a pharmaceutical company. And if you ask a psychiatrist what their names are they won’t tell you or if such a drug exists. You have to look it up on your own. I’ve never ever gotten a prescriber to tell me what’s really available in new drugs and I’ve had around fifty doctors and NPs. I got off the anti psychotics that cause severe weight gain, and I’m staying out of the hospital. I feel I’m degenerating from my illness though. Things change and I’m doing different now. My issues have escalated. I still think I’m a saint and one with God deep down ins
ide. Or I’m a fallen saint. I was hospitalized twenty times or more from 1995 to 2007. I have not had to go back since. I live on my own, alone, and I really need to do housework. I lost 20 pounds in 2008 with a change in meds. I have kept it off. For awhile I gained back ten pounds. I lost it in a month by cutting sodas out of my diet. My blood pressure dropped 50 points too. I don’t ever diet. I don’t believe in it on these drugs. It’s stupidity for a doctor to tell you to lose weight while taking some of the drugs. Exercise makes me hungry.

I still have to buy the bed, but I’ll be paying cash for that when the time comes and I wouldn’t want that used by any means. The furniture that I’ve bought already I will have paid off before I even get my apartment so that will be good. The coffee table I’m thinking about buying is $50 so that’s no big deal and the tv is 129.99 which I guess I could do without because I have the laptop but it would be nice to have so I’ll probably charge it when I get a bunch of needed kitchen and other household items. Then I’ll work at paying off that bill."

My chronic, crushing, formerly 8 / 10 headache is now a 1 / 10. Pretty much cured. On top of the reduction of pain is a reduction of symptoms, that allowed me to safely lower my meds yet again (only do this with psychiatrist approval), so no more 3 mg Paliperidone. My voices are so faint now I can’t talk to them even if I try to. It’s like super quiet half-words that I can’t make out. If I don’t try to listen to them all I hear is tinnitus. My thoughts are so calm and kind now, I feel like a monk. Totally in control of the nature of my inner dialogue. The brain inflammation is almost 100% gone.

175950018,"I'd say I've acquired enemies over the years even though most aren't in my life anymore Anyways, of higher priority to me, somehow a damselfly got inside my house today and was resting on the wall beside my front door. I caught it so that I could put it outside. I tried to make it get out of the container that I had placed it in, but it decided to sit on my hand while it groomed itself instead. I noticed that there were bits of cobweb on its feet, so I started trying to help it groom itself by using a dried leaf to brush off the web around it's legs. It started flamboyantly wagging and curling its tail up towards the sky and back down again and I had no idea what was going on. I was worried that my hand sanitizer gave it neurological issues and that it was poisoned (tarantulas can get fatal neurological issues from the fumes of certain household cleaners), but thankfully it flew away soon after. In folklore damselflies and dragonflies were called ""Snake Doctors"" They were believed to stay close t
o snakes and if a snake was injured or killed they'd sew it back up or bring it back to life. To me, they're symbolic of upheaval, so I get a bit apprehensive when they come around. Last week, I did a good deed and now I'm afraid to go near the place where it occured incase I have to do another one. I'm superstitious like that."

174339948,"Not really. I still have permanent loss but I have regained in some areas. I figured the less sedation and the less neurotransmitters hit and messed with, the less cognitive issues. I noticed the same with Latuda and a couple others. Latuda and Vrayalr were the best. Unfortunately, Latuda didn’t work at all for me and made me worse. Like another poster posted here years ago, for a severe paranoid schizophrenic, Latuda is like water or placebo. It didn’t do ????. In fact, I was convinced I was being bombarded with microwave energy, scalar waves, and stuff. I had headaches, nausea, and didn’t eat food like I was supposed to all the time. I don’t like meds that make you eat before you take the pills, otherwise they are A LOT less effective. Same thing goes with geodon. I guess geodon works better for some women and higher functioning people. Really, I didn’t give clozaril a chance because the doctor screwed my life up. He put me on a ton of meds and I almost died from NMS. I’m nervous abou
t trying Clozaril again, it’s a pain, doctor doesn’t really want to go there again, and my parents are against it. I think I had side effects like peeing my pants. These meds can suck balls sometimes, like I even had a permanent erection on some meds. It’s quite disappointing and disabiling and even traumatic how useless and complicated getting on the right meds can be. It took 5+ years with good insurance and constant treatment to find the right med for me. Vraylar. I don’t do well with anti-depressents either. My first one was Cymbalta and it worked well…still does. I wanted to try effexor but never got the chance. I could probably beg for it, but I rather not. I think the stronger they are, the worse my moods and psychosis gets. Cymbalta is pretty week. I notice some _NAME_ and when I get off of it, I get brain zaps, which suck big time. I really wanted to try adderall but couldn’t do the test because of energy drink addiction. It would interfere with the test. It was a huge pain and took years 
to even get a doctor who would consider it if I had ADHD. I tried Strattera with good results. I’m not afraid of psychosis unless it’s severe. I’ve had bat-???? insane schizophrenia for years. I’m finally doing well and happy. I just want to get better. Unfortunately, I don’t think adderall would help me at all. It could make me have new symptoms and even permanent psychotic symptoms. I had severe negs and severe cognitive decline bordering mild dementia. I mean I felt like I lost double digit IQ points over the course of the illness, but got some back. I still am not the old me. I still have issues. The old me is stuck inside this poor little body that wants to get better, return to school, and get a job some day.

175950024,"I take Daily Essential Nutrients by _NAME_ Nutritionals. It’s kind of pricey but totally worth it. It contains the organic, plant form of the vitamins and minerals rather than the inorganic, rock form that pretty much every other multivitamin uses. Upside is that the plant form vitamins are way more bioavailable and your body uses them much more readily, which facilitates the kind of healing that a person hasn’t experienced before. The downside is that the plant form vitamins take up more room, so you have to take like 12 capsules a day versus 1 capsule of the rock form. My symptoms and head pressure have plummeted in the 31 days since I’ve started taking it. Every day I just feel significantly better and better. My head pressure is starting to even out and I’m feeling more grounded and relaxed now, rather than on tilt anxious all the time."

175950049,"I drink 24 beers a week which usually ends up being 5 a day from the hours of 1:30 pm to 5pm, with two days dry. It gets me out of the bed and motivates me to do something when all I would do otherwise is lay down. I listen to music and play a video game and try to feel happy. By the time my wife comes home at 5:30 I’m sober and I cook dinner and then the effects are totally gone. I don’t know if this is too much but it doesn’t affect my home life with my wife (that only happens if I’m tipsy when she’s around). Im not sure if that’s too much on the liver but I go often for blood tests and everything has always seemed fine. Drinking gets out of control when you can’t stop and causes trouble with your loved ones. If you stick to a rigid plan of how much and at what times to drink I think it can be managed well. Don’t do what I do though, do what’s best for you, and never let yourself get out of control. I have a son and a wife so my responsibility to them keeps me in check"

175950056,I usually dont notice any effect Voices talk everyday non stop But it has hidden effect i feel like No big unwanted control of my life by voices I dont undergo shameful sexual acts i cant mention what is it exactly but i dont do that But they talk from time to time
175950057,I stopped drinking caffeine/coffee a year ago. It wasn’t helping me and making me very tired and lethargic. Since I’ve stopped drinking coffee my energy levels are a lot stable and consistent. So no caffeine for me. I usually sleep between 12:30AM and 1:00AM and wake up around 2:00PM. Even when I keep waking up and I still stay in bed trying to get more sleep instead of just getting out of bed. I also wanted to add that I meditate for 30mins before going to bed and don’t use any screens while in bed.
175950058,"I hate that too, they ask me whats my job, what I am studying, if I have a partner or if I am married, etc"

My heart beat is still racing and my BP is kinda high, 149/90 that’s the last time I check. They said if I’m nervous the bp goes high? Is that right? I talked to my husband that I wanted to look for a job. The more I stay in the house the more I think about what I feel. But I feel bad for the baby he is only 10months old. But I needed this to heal my self. I will try tomorrow to drive as well by myself. I stop driving for almost 2years. I’m overwhelmed with everything, new husband new house new place first time mom."

175950062,"I feel like I have a responsibility to hug everyone’s problems with schizophrenia and drown with them. For your information, I have synesthesia so emotional problems of others can be extremely physical and nonetheless heavy. I know that I can’t help everyone with sz, and sometimes I pray to just take everyone’s problems and drown with them. Not even sure why I’m so emotional after reading a news article about a man who committed suicide. He was a runner-up in MasterChef and had sz. It’s like, the world doesn’t give a ???? about people like us and people just die while in social exclusion. For ????’s sake, this is truly an awful world."

175950085,"Depression can be caused by many thing and not just situations. If it were just situations many would have died long back. Nutritional deficiencies can cause depression especially low zinc, vitamin b12, vitamin d etc. Low thyroid levels can cause depression. Lack of quality night sleep can cause depression. Too much time to think can cause depression so getting busy is not optional but necessity. In this way lot of things can contribute to depression."

175950097,"Lol, sometimes voices say the darndest things!"
175950098,I’ve been feeling the exact same way as that lately too. It could just be the short days and not enough vitamin d as a result. Maybe.

But I still manage to tend to my hygiene, chores, drs appointments and shopping. And I work out some. I haven’t had a mixed state since I started Saphris. Maybe she should try that, stuff is golden for bipolar."
175950112,There can be psychotic symptoms in borderline and schizotypal.

175950114,I totally agree about self imagination. It’s problematic to relate everything to yourself but it’s some how effective. Maybe it’s ok when keeping in mind the problematic virtues. Can you elaborate on what seems problematic when making a connection reference?
175950115,"It's because I'm easily replaceable. I""m no one special unless someone wants something from me. I wish I had someone who hasn't passed that loved me unconditionally."

175950117,"I am kind of in the same boat as you and I think a lot of it comes down to is, what I think about myself is due to what I think other people think of me. I still have the mindset that people are not going to give you a chance. Hopefully I can learn to be more optimistic on that though."

175950122,"If that were true, then there would be no need to treat it. They would just give bipolar 2’s antidepressants and call it a day. Now I’m never had mania or even hypomania, but something suggests to me that it can probably be dangerous, like some sort of emotional seizure. And normal people do not feel emotionally “bleh” all of the time. I mean, they don’t feel ecstatic, but rather comfortable and content. I’m not having a mood episode right now, and though some real life, non delusional things are going on right now, I still feel like being alive, like I am alive, you know?"

175950125,_AT_MENTION_ Thank you kindly
175950126,I spent 8 months in the hospital and I hated every second of it. Some things I experienced in there sucked less than other experiences. If you go into a long term hospital don’t expect it to be like a vacation or don’t think it will be easy. I had a miserable time in there and my fellow patients looked like they were miserable as me—or worse.

I’m planning to do physical exercises 5 times a week (my doctor assured it’s fine) and eat more healthy (2150 calories a day). I have a huge trouble with consistency. It’s really hard for me to be consistent with physical exercises for example. Do you have any strategies? I’m not working and just studying at home (sometimes I get in some projects for non-profits), so I have a lot of plenty time. I think it’s very important for me to stay healthy before getting into a 9-5 job. I’m doing it to enhance self-love."

175950130,I quit drinking my morning cup of coffee a few days ago. I’m feeling really withdrawn and depressed. Could this mood be related to caffeine withdrawal or is it just schizophrenia?
175950131,If you look back at your previous post you mention how you slept too much on antipsychotics. and you don't sleep at all on ADHD meds.

174339972,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The association of autistic traits with Theory of Mind and its training efficacy in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research. Cognition , Mar 2020 Literature has recently identified a discrete subgroup of patients affected by schizophrenia that also present autistic traits (ATs), showing a peculiar cognitive, clinical and functional profile. Theory of Mind (_NAME_) represents a core, impaired feature in both schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), _NAME_ in patients with schizophrenia and ATs has yet to be investigated. Thus, this study aims, on the one hand, to assess differences among patients with and without ATs on clinical, cognitive and _NAME_ abilities as well as in daily functioning; on the other hand, to compare the efficacy on mentalizing abilities of a specific _NAME_ training in these two groups. Ninety-six patients with schizophrenia wer
e enrolled and underwent a broad cognitive, social-cognitive and functional assessment before and after the _NAME_ training. ANOVAs revealed that patients with schizophrenia and ATs are more impaired in cognition, _NAME_, in premorbid and daily functioning as well as in clinical features, as compared to patients without ATs. This latter group also showed a general improvement in mentalizing abilities after _NAME_ training, while patients with schizophrenia and ATs did not, with a significant time × group interaction on _NAME_ abilities. These data shed new light on the relation among schizophrenia and ATs, highlighting that patients with these traits are highly impaired in _NAME_ abilities. Thus, ATs seem to limit the effectiveness of _NAME_ training, having implications in clinical and rehabilitative practice."

174339975,My husband married me after my diagnosis. We had dated for a year. I think you can find love. But be picky about who you let in your life. Some guys would use that fact about you in an abusive way so don’t just accept anyone who has interest in you. Make sure they’re the right one.

I can only take my meds, hope for the best, and limit or avoid caffeine. I think I recently attained happiness. It took over 7 years of hell to get there. I’m now focusing on my health. I want to lose weight, eat better, get a woman, etc. I also want to be an engineer or programmer to make money. I’m tired of living off scraps. It basically feels like I’m in a time loop for lack of a better term. Things do change very, very little but almost nothing changes. I’ve talked about it here before. It makes me think this universe is ????????, a fabrication. A place for me to learn a hard lesson over and over again for eternity. If one believes in the multiverse (most do not I think) than there should be an infinite amount of universes where I don’t have this stupid illness. Unfortunately, I’m trapped to 
say the least. I’m stuck getting SZ the same away ad infinitum from pot (8 years ago) in college from severe, severe psychosis. It was the worst mental breakdown I could fathom. I literally lost touch of reality for hours but it seemed like years. I sometimes doubt free will is even real and an illusion at best.

Lots round here can attest to that.

175950179,Welcome to the forum They’re not imaginary.
175950180,I used to find the voices a bit too much when out and about with friends sometimes. I always did find them overwhelming. I often felt like I needed to be alone because it seems easier to cope with them then.
175950181,"Awhile back, the FDA investigated to see if there was a higher death rate with this drug, and they found that there was not.

175950192,"My doc don’t want to switch my zyprexa. It has the less side effects on me. The problem is that it’s like a candy for me… Maybe I was ultra sick for too long? And that’s why I don’t feel it still? It pulled me out of the bed, but my psyche is sick still… Should I really show patience and just try to do more and more every day? Can it work in years, not in months? Or I’ll just never get better? I tried all the others aps, you know this… Even the junkies like the zyprexa. But my mind is always ruminating here, sometimes I get very painful headaches in fact… For my situation now - I mostly have my fears (and then the somatic symptoms) , my cognitive deficiency, the lack of positive emotions, my paranoid brain. But maybe it’s normal to be so bad after 20 years of illness… I should wait still? I hear you when you say to me, that I should move, but sometimes it’s impossible.

175079639,In the US unfortunately we have people of two minds. Those who wear masks and those who refuse. I have multiple medical issues so I cannot afford to get covid. I would not survive it unless I had a mild case. I stay inside away from people. I go out in my yard and walk in the sunshine yet somehow life has lost some of its grandeur. Upon hearing a vaccine would not be available before covid was rampant across the US has taken considerable wind from my sails. Not just me but my friends feel the same way. I listen to the youth of the US say they were not worried about covid one bit. They say yes they may get sick but will recover quickly. This is great news for them but terrible for the elderly and those with preexisting conditions. Really we are in our seventh month of this pandemic. What a horrible way for us to live our lives. I know everyone here has their coping techniques and I do as well yet I still let all this get to me. I pray for better days ahead. God bless us all

It’s not perfect, but the overwhelming sadness and suicide ideation are gone. Warning: If you have problems with positive symptoms or manic episodes Isocarboxide and other MAO-inhibitors might worsen them because MAO-I increase levels of dopamine in the brain.

And alone. And I found out I was alone. When the community college noticed I was tripping along. I was sent home where I belong.
175950221,That’s great news. Always good to keep a good shrink. Sounds like things are coming together nicely.
174339991,Clozapine is one of the best things to ever happen to me. For the first 6 months I was fairly drowsy and immediately went to sleep when I took the night time dosage. My legs felt like jello for those first couple of months. I would sleep around 13 hours. I’ve been on it 7-8 months now. When I take the evening dose it takes about 2 hours to kick in. Before I was on it I was living day to day. I could barely get through the day on Risperdal. I always thought about my future I didn’t think I was going to make it. On Clozapine I feel much more comfortable. It also allows me to exercise. I couldn’t exercise on Risperdal. I’ve lost a ton of weight. Good luck

175950228,"The voices got nothing on you, that’s why they have to try to convince you of stuff, they’re weak. You got this. The way I look at it is - if the voices aren’t real, it’s simply a matter of dismissing negative thoughts, and if by some weird thing they are like these negative entities or something, it’s a matter of telling them to take a hike when it concerns your personal self and well being. So basically either way, shut them down."
175950229,"Hey gonzalezeri1974. Your problems and feelings are important. They don't have to be ""big"" to be important. The fact that you are reaching out before it comes to issues of self-harm and suicidal thoughts (I could be wrong) is awesome. You are looking after yourself in the best way that you know how and that's enough. I think the best thing that I have been told is that depression comes in waves. You have to ride the waves. I have been diagnosed as having bipolar, MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and anxiety. I have become a pro-surfer at this point lol. It doesn't feel like it in the moment but it does get better. The calm does come. As long as you do the work to get better and feel better, the calm comes. If you haven't already it really does start with making your Dr aware. One piece of advice. If they try to prescribe you something, wait! They just throw out meds without knowing the effects that they can have on people. Get referred to a specialist to handle your meds. After I started the meds 
that my regular Dr prescribed I tried to commit suicide. They made me more impulsive which is one of the traits of my bipolar, but they didn't take that into account. Just because you didn't mention it, have you tried some medication for it? It doesn't have to be a scenario where you are drugged to holy hell and you can't think straight. It can really help to calm things down while you learn skills to be able to deal with depression. Like I said...make sure it is a specialist! Please! My biggest help has been my therapist. It is so nice to have someone that won't judge and that you know has experience with others who suffer from the same monsters as you. My therapist also acts a constant for me. Now I have to admit, this takes ALOT of trust. She tracks my moods, my thoughts she really does do it all for me. She calls me on my crap and helps me untangle all the thoughts that are killing me. Try not to listen to all of the negative talk about therapists. Once you find the right one, I think that she is the most 
important person on my mental health team."

In my four decades dealing with bp 1 with tons of psychosis and lots of addcition to absolutely everything, I can pretty much guarantee you that it is going to be far more difficult to achieve stability of any kind with non-prescribed substances in the mix.

175950289,"beckla1985, Greetings! I’m sorry that things have been tough recently, but I can share what we do for anxiety around here: we train service dogs to help with anxiety. I can’t really say if this is likely to be helpful to you, but we’re likely to train a dog to help someone in situations where they feel that a task-trained dog is likely to be helpful. When we’re told that someone has severe anxiety while being crowded on a busy street corner (waiting for a light to change) and it feels as though the people are pressing in on them, we’ll train dogs to “make space” which enables a client to more comfortably wait to safely cross an intersection rather than react badly to the momentary situation. A service dog can also be helpful when there’s a need to encourage engagement with members of the public (the dog can be directed to get a person’s attention) which may be useful when dissociating or reacting in an unsafe manner might be problematic. The interaction - the dog with the handler 
and managing the dog/stranger interaction can help some handlers to remain grounded and not slip away. These are just two examples of behaviors that a dog or different dogs might offer to mitigate challenges for their human partners. It’s very helpful when a service dog provider can learn and co-create specific interventions for a client based upon information exchanged with the client and members of their support team.

174340007,"No. Even the doctors are changing the diagnosis all the time though, from ptsd to schizophrenia to bipolar to borderline to autism back to schizophrenia. I know i had (have?) psychosis, but i do not believe in the story of it being a genetic, chronic brain disease which is caused by imbalance in neurotransmitters."

175950293,My pdoc prescribed to fix my oversleeping and constant tiredness. After all those trials I eventually figured out I have a sleep disorder as well. So now I use light therapy in morning and microdose of melatonin at night (0.3mg) (the physical amount the body needs not a pharmacological dose) It helps a lot. Not perfect but world’s better
175950294,I’ve had periods of time like that. I’ve spent even more time sleeping and still tired. I guess I was depressed. Do you take an anti-depressant?

175950299,"Today my team have got a very very vey important game (football) and we must win, and i played so badly, i dun even know how to react/play in some scenarios that i have been used to , i was daydreaming most of the time on the pitch, in the past i did know how to play football decently , with a good decision making and thinking to help my team but today, i play so craply , and i had not taken my medication actually quite a few months ago , and i wonder if it has affected my ability to play football because i was so run out of my idea and my mind is so slow in taking a pass , making a decision, i have always thought if i had taken the medication would it be a different story, would i be able to help me team. And I was so suck now on the pitch , i had lost most of my “character” on the pitch , i feel so lost but what i think very ironic is that at the time before i take any medication i think i still can perform quite well, so these few weeks i wonder if it is the withdrawal effect or my psychotic 
brain which makes me so uncapable of being myself on the pitch. would it be a different story if i taken my medication so that i can contribute more to the team. I feel the state of my mind has made me lost a good grip on the pitch . but i feel very ironic that i have to be on medication so that i can be performing and be myself…am i some chemical compounds or who am I without the medicine…i think i have made my team to pay the price for my unwillingness to take the medication. thanks for reading the whole long story"

I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of nervous and mental disease , Apr 26 2019 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) is one of the most widely used instruments to measure cognitive functioning. The aims of this study were 1) to obtain the cognitive profile of Spanish patients with schizophrenia on the WAIS-IV; 2) to compare their profile to the profile of a healthy control group; and 3) to compare the cognitive profile of patients with schizophrenia to the performance observed in two separate previous studies in Canada and China. A sample of 99 outpatients and 99 healthy control participants, matched on age, sex, and educational level, were measured using the WAIS-IV, including 10 core subtests, 4 indices, and 2 general intelligence scores, to obtain their cognitive profile. Results showed that only the performance on the Verbal Comprehension Index and its subtests was similar in the pa
tient and control groups. This pattern of cognitive impairment was similar to the pattern reported in the Canadian and Chinese studies."

So gonna be inactive a lot of places while I try and find a place. GOOD news is…I recently went to my therapist and we were talking about how I’ve not taken my AP meds for a whole year now. I’ve been functioning pretty damn well without them according to her (I’ve even been holding a job since May!!) and that she thinks I don’t need them anymore, since i’ve used other coping mechanisms than medication, and while I still have hallucinations…I can cope when they get bad without AP medication. She even said that seeing how strong my mind is, and the strength of will I have is astonishing and she hasn’t seen that often in patients who, like me, are diagnosed with Schizo-affective disorder. It was a HUGE boost to my confidence, and I’m happy to hear that she believes I can cope and function without my AP medicine
, and hearing her call me strong has only boosted my confidence in myself!"

175950324,"I’m going to offer a metaphysical theory. Take it with a grain of salt. People in “the _NAME_ show” delusion are producing a chronically high amount of adrenochrome, which is giving them a 24/7 psychedelic trip and basically “gating” them to the spiritual realm all the time. Spiritual beings metaphysically watch you through that, and interact with you with whatever you’re doing at the time. You can’t really influence anything outside of your visible and audible environment though, as far as things you will observe in the future. There are preventative measures against that. You can’t be messing with everything through your gating, but you’re possibly messing with something. You can’t control the externals, either, but you can stop this from happening by healing the brain injury causing this gating. There’s reams of plausible deniability around this theory, so you will have a hard time correlating this with others."

175950333,"I think the forum has got very political recently and it’s probably my fault, so much of my delusions revolve around politics. When I first joined there were lots of people with genuine symptoms, they all seem to have left now. I mentioned _PERSON_ who thought that mental illness was the fault of society, and thus a political issue. That is certainly true, but it is also a medical issue, the problem for me is that medicine has its politics too, which medication to use, which theory of the mind to use. I mentioned that so called Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) didn’t recognise the brain as an organ, the various faculties of the mind are distributed over the complex dynamical system of the various organs in the body such as the liver, lungs and heart. In other systems dating before the advent of modern Western medicine, the heart or the liver was considered to house the mind fully. These are all theories that have their place, and choosing the one that fits the patient requires asking the pati
ent what they feel is wrong and being proficient in the application of the one that fits. One can only apply what one knows and if the patient feels differently, then the politics of medicine arises. I do hope people who genuinely need help, as opposed to people who just want to vent, return here, as I feel there are many people who have the ability to help others on the site. The focus has become far too narrow. Thank you."

My doctor told me this could a passing phase and there are ups and downs in life so just force yourself to do things even if u don’t feel like doing it. I tried my best but still was depressed. He then lowered my Risperdal from 6mg to 3mg and added escitalopram for depression. After about a month or two I was back to normal. Now I am on my normal dose of Risperdal i.e. 6 mg.

175950367,"I am 56 dating a 38 year old with a porn addiction. I am an open minded person but have found it VERY DIFFICULT to deal with his addiction. I have watched it with him many times trying to see and understand the drive and satisfaction he finds in it. We are both in substance abuse recovery and he really doesn't find that porn is a problem but yet the more he watches the harder and longer it is for him to climax with me which in turn shatters my confidence bit by bit, especially when he constantly speaks of young hot blondes (my being an (old)er hot blond...lol). He's aware of his addiction he just doesn't see it as a problem. I beg to differ but try to remain understanding and supportive. I suggested he talk to his therapist about it which he did and now feels not as compelled to watch as much. It's like the more people he shares it with like myself and his therapist makes it more Not so much as a dirty little secret or however you want to put it. But he also has been watching porn from a very young 
age even younger than 12 and The men in his family that is just what they did. My advice being is if you have a therapist ask their opinion if you don't get 1. And only you know the personality of your wife if she would be Open to discussing such a matter Or not. But she is your wife And No secret In any marriage is healthy. Because we have a saying in AA and that is ""we are only as sick as our secrets"". Give your wife the benefit of the doubt and let her share in the good and or the bad with you.

This is happening to me since past 21 years…But since past 10 years, strangers also spell out my family members names. I am unable to find reason how those strangers know my family member names"
175950399,Yes it is. I don’t know what to do. I can’t go below 1000 calories. MyFitnessPal.com says that is not safe. I eat about 1100 calories a day. I burn about 250- 300 calories a day everyday. I don’t know what else to do?
175950400,Went to day treatment Had a orientation meeting to get started with peer coaching Got a cd from the library Had a bubble tea Planning to eat some ribs and strawberries when I get home. ^.^
175950401,I’m grateful that I’ll get some groceries delivered this week. I’ll tag _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ To see what they’re grateful for.
175950402,"That’s a good strategy, really. I’m glad it helps. Honestly though, with my grandpa, I didn’t think I was human. I thought I was a god. _AT_MENTION_ No, he wasn’t delusional, but he was eight. He didn’t try to murder the dog. He was legit just pulling the leash. You’re 57, goddamn."
175950403,"Yes, only him can refer me to a new pdr. I am thinking about just waiting until January for Vraylar and if it doesn’t come out in Canada I will change him and try new meds, Geodon or lower Risperdal to 3mg with _PERSON_’s mane maybe."
175950404,"One thing to note is that only about 20% of people who try drugs get addicted. And yes alcohol is a drug and the figures are exactly for the same for alcoholism and drug addiction rates. Meaning 20% of people who try alcohol get addicted, same number as illicit and unprescribed intoxicating drugs Which doesn’t come as a surprise to me but I think it’s worthy of mentioning."

175950406,_AT_MENTION_. That’s got to hurt. How was the relationship in the beginning since it must have started well or else you two wouldn’t have moved in together at the start.
175950407,At my old thin walled apartment the noises I heard from neighbors made me feel they had it out for me. I liked the people and they were always friendly and they even invited me over for dinner many more times than I could possibly repay. The result: I still had those nagging negative thoughts. So my coping technique was to leave the apartment for a while. Take a walk in the woods or park. Feed the ducks stale bread. I have a car so I’d sit in parking lots and just people watch for a while. Other times I would put on headphones and blast deafening music into my ears. I’m not saying what works for me will be your solution. But I am glad you can write and vent your feelings here. Let us know in a few how you are doing if you wish.

175950417,"my fantasy is my life and i have no issue with that. i've shaped my life around fantasy. sometimes they aren't meant to live in the world though. i create them nonetheless. write them. fling my fish to the shore to drown. it's hard to try and guide my fantasies to be more productive. i find it's best i just act as their slave. i've had much more ""success"" that way. riding the waves to whatever shore it takes me. one day, i hope that shore is filled with engorged bank accounts and excessive square footage. i used to live in such a big house. i had a ""wing"" if you can believe it. haha. and that was just the main house. to have that in my future seems a far off dream. i did dream once of something beautifully dark. i wrote about it. over and over in so many ways. and one day i found it, in the world. threw all my hopes and dreams into that wave and rode it. hard to say if that was a good idea. i did get what i wanted, but there was a price to pay for living that fantasy. i'm not the same person i 
was because of it. which isn't necessarily bad. this week i've been obsessed. a fantasy driving me past the point i should let it. i haven't really been sleeping much. haven't been doing much of anything but writing it. It's the type of fantasy that's just a story. Not something that could be made real. my neck hurts from leaning over the keyboard. i'm tired. i suppose i might be hungry but i don't really know that. my eyes are blinded to everything else. it's painful to think i'll need to be away from this fantasy tomorrow, because i have other things to do. christ. i just need it done. need to see it to it's end. and what will it get me? nothing. nothing but time i probably should have spent doing chores or some other inane, repetitive task. this fantasy isn't something others would want. like i said though. i'll create it. fling it to the shore to drown. people will grimace as they walk by it's corpse. and yet i'll still be smiling, thinking it such a beautifully horrible thing i've made. and right now? th
is fervor? it's what i live for. in the end i feel like all my fantasies are the same. some twisted version of each other. the same characters playing out over and over. i feel like there's a dark ache inside me that throbs. it's where my fantasies are born. i have no idea what it is. my soul i guess."
174340037,"Live is a miracle of material science and physics at the very least from our rational understandings. We’re in a very fortunate place to understand our reality and to make meaning where none exists. Just because there isn’t necessarily a fool proof meaning doesn’t mean we cannot choose it for ourselves. I cherish my family and have fought to make those relationships mean the most to me. Even though I’ve taken this schizophrenia pretty harshly and am suffering, there is still worth in loving my family and making the most of my bum situation. Try to find something you still love still value and keep trying to do something to further it."
175950418,"I hate the schizoid subreddit. I used to think being schizoid was really cool or something, a great defense mechanism and almost admirable.

Nothing keeps you from going back but your own will to want and need to share these things with someone, and I looked for someone comfortable. You just kind of know, it’s like a split second thing you decide immediately when you walk in the door. Before even meeting that person. Is the place nice, are they discrete, is the room nice, did the councilor make it homey and personal? Are they kind, do they say things that I deem as judging right off the bat, or do they just ask you to talk and do they want to get to know you and see if your personalities mesh as well?"
175950422,Not a bad idea.
174340035,"Schizophrenia for me is like a whole other mind that is aware of not only my conciousness but my subconcious as well. Hes omnicient and has the deepest feelings of hate towards me. Whatever he wants me to think or feel, i think or feel that. I literally said to myself a while ago that schizophrenia is the best thing that ever happened to me because it showed me what i was doing wrong. No i was wrong, schizophrenia is obviously the worst thing. I dont even know when it is me in the drivers seat or if schizophrenia is. What i do know is that i dont know what reality is supposed to be anymore and i ??????? hate schizophrenia."

175950432,"_AT_MENTION_, The way my wife and I get by so well is that we never go out anywhere for entertainment. We only rarely eat at a restaurant. We are true homebodies who never leave home except for the occasional Dr. appointment. My wife has a car that is paid for. I don’t own a car or drive at all so, I save a lot of money that way. My wife drives me. Also, we rarely buy anything unless it is absolutely essential. (I taught my wife that). And we rarely to never take a vacation. We’ve only been on one in the 16 years I’ve known her."

175950438,"I’ve struggled with money my whole life. I’ve gone weeks without eating because I didn’t qualify for food banks. I didn’t have a place to live, and they wouldn’t take me at the shelters because they said I was too hard to handle. During this time I relied on people being generous as I pan handled. For two years my income shows as 4,000$ Canadian for the whole year. All that money went to food, or my wash so I could keep my clothes dry. I didn’t qualify for health care then either because I couldn’t prove residence or obtain a birth certificate. I’m doing much better now. I was able to gain employment at Walmart. It’s sad because I went to University and can’t use my credentials due to a criminal record. But I have work, I’m currently on _NAME_ leave. They have really good retirement funds, and I’ve decided to stay the long haul. It’s hard for me to find employment nowadays. It causes me a lot of anxiety, routine, I hate to say it keeps me stable. I’m also in a relationsh

175950439,"They call themselves experts in mental illness when they haven’t experienced a mental illness themselves which I find amusing. They don’t have a clue what it is REALLY like. Psychiatrists have the theory (Schooling) but not the practice(Experiencing a mental illness) and as the old saying goes… “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice, in practice there is”. It’s like calling yourself an expert in skydiving when you’ve studied the plane and parachute but never jumped out of a plane…or any other analogy you can come up with."

If you’re looking for excuses as to why you shouldn’t work then you’ll always find what you’re looking for. Keep up the positives. Job doesn’t automatically mean cigarettes. Hell, you could look at it like if I don’t get a job bc of fear I’ll be depressed and I might start smoking cigarettes. I’m just meaning you can put the negatives into any equation.

175950466,Yeah I would say stay away from anything that could trigger you. I can see how conspiracy and religious stuff can trigger people. Most things don’t trigger me only alien stuff tend to only if other people with out my sickness can fall into and even then most stuff most people believe in about aliens is garbage to me. My only delusions I get are about Aliens are that they are here and built a computer and use it to do things with me and they used nanoradio bots to achieve what they are doing. I believed thy used microwave radio communication to the nanoradio bots in the brain to do what they do to me even magnetic wave communication like what they use now in the mines incase of a emergency that can penetrate miles threw the earth but magnetic waves are very slow that could take over a 4 second delay to reach 3 miles of earth or something like that. So yeah even the net while looking up science can trigger you finding something that seems plausible to your condition can be bad like the medusa device 
that most I’m sure have found on the net while even looking up hearing voices that someone hearing voices.Had put together on a webpage to explain the government is trying to torment them with the medusa device to talk to them. I was triggered once with that one some years ago when the voices started saying they are from the government and are using microwaves on me. I thought to look it up on the net and found the web page talking about the delusional persons page about the device and it took me a while to snap out of it. So yeah don’t even look anything up on the net that you may hear from your voices or you could fall into a bad hole.

It’s a huge turn off for me, as a majority of people who live successful lives with schizophrenia also have healthy spiritual practices. It seems unfair to censor all talk about religion unless its completely nutso. But this topic is actually upsetting about eugenics and euthanasia. Gross. It kind of makes me wonder like no wonder people stop taking their meds. There is something called “open dialogue” and it seems to have helped a lot of people but you don’t hear about that on here.

175950501,"it is not too difficult. you gotta look at a reference photo and really truly just draw wat u see, every line and every shade and every reflection. it also helps to try and feel what she is feeling in the drawing so that you can draw every marking with that feeling and transfer it to the page oh and caffeine ahaha."
175950502,"I switch from smoking to vaping, theres more chemicals in cigarettes than vaping, theres about 7000 chemicals in ciggarettes when burn,in vaping theres only 4 ingredient flavoring, nicotine if want nic theres non nictone juices outthere, vegetable glycerin, propyplene glycol. Cigerretes kills millions vaping, barely few deaths, deaths are related tainted juices."

174340060,Can you try something different.It has so much serious side effects.Did you tried novel antipsichotics?
175950506,"Hmm?. The Answer To Your Question…, Is Yes!. Although I Still Don’t Know What They Look Like. . . . . . . Hope, Love, Joy, And Peace!."
175950507,"Greetings MHA,,,,today I'm just browsing through the stories, perhaps we share some things in common."
175950508,"We call my cat Baby too. His real name is _PERSON_, but we never called him that. He thinks he is the king and my GF is his queen. I am but a lowly servant."
175950509,Super cool _AT_MENTION_.
175950510,"Ok, the problem with schizophrenia and talking to god is when god answers back. I’m an atheist and when I was really sick even I had religious “unusual beliefs”. It can end up being quite dangerous. Have you been officially diagnosed with schizophrenia or anything?"
175950511,That’s something a person needs when they wont take medicine and cant handle money ect. If the person doesnt have such problems custodianship seems unfair to me. I’m a schizo nobody has that kind of control over me.
175950512,"I said this about a year ago. I think to help yourself you have to make a change to improve your situation or your life. I’m 58 but when I was younger I had to make changes that I basically had no control over. But they were good for me whether I liked them or not. So I went to a day program to get me out of the house during a real terrible relapse. I went three or four days a week and played board games and charades and sat through groups and went for walks and cooked lunch etc. And I did that for months. I did not love it but the alternative was sitting home alone all day doing nothing with zero money. That’s one example. I attended a couple of vocational programs that kept me busy and resulted eventually into jobs. Those were three examples. It was hard to enjoy those things because I was shy and not talkative except to a few people. I wasn’t popular but I don’t think anybody hated me. I don’t like change now but I was a lot more flexible and adaptable when I was in my twenties and thi
rties. You’re still young and adaptable and change can be easy sometimes. Sometimes changes are no big deal but if you could just find something to do besides obsessing about neighbors it might really, open some doors and lead to better circumstances or relief. But you have to bite the bullet and take a chance and join something. It doesn’t have to be a program, it could be having a mental health worker come to your house for a chat and lunch. It could be volunteering one day a week. Anything is better than nothing. You will never beat these neighbors, in fact things could get worse. But you make your own luck. Take control of your life and find some activity, somewhere to go. I mean aren’t you at the point where doing anything no matter how hard or uncomfortable would be better than what you’re doing now?"
175950513,"At least, for now anyway. I’ve been rather erratic in my thinking and it’s been showing up on here. Been using a lot of music and social connection to help, of course. Still keeping an eye on the weather, although the temperatures we’ve been having are still rather mild even for this time of year, for the most part."
175950514,My doctor increased my risperidone to 5mg from 4mg.
175950515,No personal experience. My old pdoc liked using it because it’s an SSRI without most of the sexual side effects. He said a lot of his patients liked it.
174340057,Im thinking of getting the shot since im not very compliant every day. How long did it take to get some relief from symptoms? Does it help paranoia or intrusive thoughts?
175950516,"Not sure if this was visible on my channel. But the ‘creative’ mind here changes colors of their bracelet and that’s nifty bc it was probably an Easter egg or shout out, or sadly just an inside joke. To balance out my cynicism."
175950517,"Divorce is very difficult, I have personal experience with it. I’m glad you have your sister _AT_MENTION_ . You will get through this."
175950518,Thanks I have the opposite problem. I find crochet tricky. I find knitting easier. I think I prefer the effect of crochet. It looks better. Only two squares to go until my mum teaches me to crochet them together. One pink and one blue.
174340063,"But I was crazy back then. I wrote love poems about her on reddit in something like delirium, and I wrote a love letter on a real paper, asking her to marry me"
175950519,"Maybe from not eating enough too right, you weren't eating much for awhile"
175950520,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 15
175950521,I find much enjoyment in the mundane!
175950522,I blacked out for some time when trying to change my medication. I lost touch with reality and had no knowledge of anything for a number of days.
175950523,I dread waking up nowadays too.
175950524,"Caffeine helps with my ADHD, so English Breakfast Tea is good, but too much caffeine is bad. Red Bush soothes me and Chamomile makes me sleepy, whilst Mint wakes me up without giving me the energy boost of English Breakfast. I’m not sure about Moringa, I tried it and thought it was mildly hallucinogenic as is Tobacco tea, but both are probably preferable to smoking. I’ve smoked English Breakfast Tea on occasion, and that is an interesting hit, but I’m not sure it is advisable, even without the side affects to the lungs. Green Tea is said to be very healthy, but I find it quite intense, and have heard it can damage the liver, like many anti-psychotics and anti-agers, if over consumed. Then again, over consumption of anything is bad for you. I used to love Lemon and Honey as a child, but don’t take sugar anymore, not even Honey or Fruit, which are two of the best forms of sugar available. Blackcurrent tea is soothing and tasty, but haven’t had that in a while, and never felt it did anything 
much other than taste nice. Lemon and Ginger is also said to be very healthy, but I’m not exactly sure what it does for SZ being more about the immune system as I understand it. Finally Nettle tea has rave reviews, but I haven’t studied it enough to pass judgment yet. I’m sure there are lots more people can think of. So which is the best for you and SZ?"
175950525,"OMG, I’m so afraid"
175950526,It’s true in my case. At first I didn’t recognize my family and my neighbors. I think they’re replaced by alien impostors. Now i don’t recognize my own body. Whose body is this?
175950527,thank you _NAME_. I always wonder what happens when people say their struggles. Yes it does make sense. Your therapist sounds like a good therapist. he cares about you and he’s nice because he doesn’t mind it when you contacts him a lot. I’m glad you posted. I’m not sure what the right answer is. But if he is a source of comfort to you and you feel you can reach him in a crisis and he doesn’t mind the emails i can understand that. That does make sense.
175950528,Hey guy just wondering how people deal with loneliness?
175950529,"Even though she is meant to be Asian, doesn’t she remind anyone a bit of _NAME_?"
175950530,"You can’t trust the posted stuff at all because they’re based on abstracts of papers, not the full paper. Most of the time armchair scientists think an abstract is the full study and cite them as proof of things. Kind of like “Google University” or “Wikipedia University”"
175950531,I lost 2 more pounds. I now weigh 202lbs. I originally weighed 218lbs not too long ago. Lost 16 pounds so far.
175950532,I work in an office most days and my stress levels are good. I am engaged but not overly stressed out. My job is very difficult. They say it takes 3 to 5 years to learn it and I am only 6 months in. In another 6 months I can work from home. Then I will be really lost. Have to make lots of phone calls.
175950533,I think I’ve had a psychotic episode post-delusions. It just resulted in my disassociating heavily and being overloaded by powerful hallucinations. I didn’t lose any insight but it was still terrifying.
175950534,"I just feel completely worthless. I've failed. I don't even see the point of existing. Like what am I doing here? What am I doing every day? It's not worth it. _PERSON_: When people talk to me, I hate the way I talk back. I usually don't care to react about what people say because of anhedonia so I just act. All I do is act. I hate myself. I wish I was someone else. My step dad caused me to act this way. I didn't stand up for myself. I just acted. It's like I have some type of severe identity crisis."
175950535,"I make my efforts… It’s an effort to stay alive even, when you are ill since kid… I work on my thinking, I try to be more active, to socialise etc… The problem is that I somatize a lot, so I literally feel still every day my illness so she still controls me… I feel like I just say dumb things all the time and I don’t have a healthy “me” anymore… I just wonder how to get through the moments of big despair about my future, where I feel my screwed mind only etc etc… Idk why I knew only the pain in this illness… It was too much but whatever."
175950536,Can you take a sleeping tablet? When I feel I might be getting psychotic I take a sleeping tablet because sleeping helps. I also drink and eat well. Dote on myself to get good nourishment because when I’m psychotic I stop eating and drinking all together so I have to keep a eye on that. Simple to do list of simple tasks such as brush teeth .have breakfast etc Hope you will feel better soon.
175950537,Thank you dear _AT_MENTION_
175950538,I can’t tell because I’m used to having psychosis and don’t care as long as the voices are partially blocked.
175950539,"I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask for a rule that members add “CW” (content warning) before making sexual posts. I’m not automatically triggered by sexual or genital posts, but it sure adds drops to the cup when it happens on a daily basis. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to make an addition to the rules stating peope should have content warnings on sexual topics. If we do it for delusion triggers and violence, why not sexual content?"
175950540,"I work as a care manager currently in a rural county. With these changing times it is important to support each other. I wanted to reach out and see how the impact of the people was affecting people and how people are able to find resources. With kids being home from school and it recently being extended in some school. I was wondering how families are handling this added stress and anxiety to daily routines. Furthermore, how are kids feeling about the change of routines?"
175950541,"Yeah unfortunately in the US once you are on SSI or even SSDI you are pretty much stuck there unless you make a heroic effort to get off of it. _AT_MENTION_ ’s try is an example of that (how many of you could handle a $3,200 bill from the government with whatever job you are on? Although he appealed it and succeeded he could have lost.) I was put on SSI when I was very sick with my parents and doctors literally pushing it on me. I dreamed constantly of leaving it and did volunteer and some paid work but quit in my 40’s when my body was failing me and my Dad’s death caused a relapse and I saw that I had accomplished nothing from it.). I hope the low number of people over 50 on the poll is due to that generation’s lack of knowledge of computers although my poll was definitely not scientific. I think I’ll close the poll now. Thank you for participating."

174340069,"my first diagnosis was schizophrenic. I didn’t exhibit any mood symptoms because I was in public and with a stranger. but my pdoc now saw me all pissed off and fired up last time I was in the hospital and she says im schizo-affective. I think my new diagnosis is right. I was always moody, very up and down about life. it’s more accurate but weirdly my moods have been stable on meds. well I do still get down but struggle to find the ups that used to be more prevalent."

175950547,I don’t know how people coped with “lack of haldol” before haldol was invented.
175950548,"Do you also use a daily/maintenance AP? I used to hate haldol, but now im quite okay about it, especially how fast it works prn. Hope it works for you. Do know though that if you take it prn there might be more side effects, in my experience, because your body doesnt get used to it."
174340073,"That’s funny. I don’t have any other person diagnosed with schizophrenia in my family. There’s a distant cousin who’s diagnosed with bipolar and a distant granduncle who got very depressed after going to war (what’s not a surprise). If schizophrenia is genetic, I suspect it’s not my case."
175950549,This is my method that I came up with textuploader[dot]com[slash]1dx5s Tell me what you guys think of it? It is a relatively new method. So there will be a lot of problems with it. I want a lot of people to try this method and email me some feedback. That way I can try to clear some things up about it. Or add stuff to it.
175950550,I have two sugars in my tea (sometimes three). You don't get pictures of fat peaple with no teeth and failing health and warnings of death on bags of sugar.
175950551,_AT_MENTION_.. Make sure to find the best antipsychotic med then stick to only one. 1-2 years and you brain will smoothen out like mine (Cuz we're under 25). Our brains are still developing and now is the best time to stabilize ourselves. Injections are smoother in a way cuz the chemical releases in the night time and day time instead of just the day time but the concentration in the blood decreases at the end of the month. It also increases in blood concentration a few days after the injection is given which is why I'm complaining about being a zombie right now!!!

I’m also out of Haldol tablets. Apparently I become ill very quick without meds."
174340064,Work depends on your negative symptoms like motivation and apathy. Do you have negative symptoms and are your positive symptoms stable?

175950557,I am just wondering. I was thinking of posting the first chapter of my book. If it’s interesting to anyone maybe I would publish it. I almost did once but I chickened out. I won’t use my name and it seems pointless to publish an anonymous book. How would you promote it? I wrote the first chapter in such a way as to try to get the reader to understand what it feels like to be psychotic. But obviously no one else has ever read it.

175950562,"Hi StillBlue Thank you for your honest and courageous post. I really feel for you and relate to much that you shared. Something that jumped out at me was your mentioning how sex is one of the few things that gives you pleasure. That’s pretty great. So I’m, I guess, encouraging you toward figuring out a way to ensure that is a regular thing in your life. Even with the challenges you mentioned I bet you and your husband can figure something out. And there’s always masturbation to tide you over til the next time :) This might not work for you, because of your work pressures .. but something I’ve been doing since Covid is baking goodies for my neighbors and their kiddos when I can’t sleep. Then I have little treats to pass round and it’s a nice connection that keeps me from spiraling into ruminating! Will be thinking of you?? _PERSON_"

There are two groups (one staying on the same dose and lowering dose) and as mentioned I’m lowering my dose. I was in 150mg and now I’m hoping to go 75mg from 100mg. I hope to completely stop taking it in the near future. Mentally I’m not too bad. I do have symptoms but they aren’t usually that bad unless I’m really stressed about something. If I remember rightly the study is being done by University College London, but not sure. I’m being monitored by a study psychiatrist and I have to see my psychiatrist before the dosage is lowered."

175950614,"Its been one week and my body went into a state of Panic about a week ago when I had several stressful things going on. Since then ive been battling this feeling of uneasiness in my stomach. It makes me feel helpless and my anxiety makes me have a feeling hopelessness and dread like something bad is going to happen? Im on 10mg of Lexapro with .50 xanax as needed. Ive taken .25 xanax about 4 days ago but im also worried that im using that as a crutch/getting addidcted to them. Im trying to battle this beast using a “sober” mind and not having to run to a pill everytime I feel uneasy. Sorry for the long post and rant, im just feeling like such a bad spot right now."
175950615,I used to clean once a week but I haven’t been able to get myself to do it lately. I haven’t vacuumed for months and I don’t know how to change vacuum bags and I have no more vacuum bags to change with and don’t know how to buy them. I have clothes laying around. I still do the dishes once a week and wash clothes once a week but haven’t changed my sheets for a couple months or so. I cleaned once a week when I lived with my x boyfriend. He is so great. Someone destructive stops me from exercising and makes me binge eat sometimes. My care worker is lovely but doesn’t help me clean. I don’t have a real care worker I just think I have one in spirit or I imagine I do. I don’t like it too clean. It’s so sterile and boring. My favourite messiness was with my x. Was so perfect. But no one tells me what I can and can’t eat and I don’t approve of animals getting tortured… My x is the best leader in the world but why should I obey someone I disagree with? I don’t want to be a obedient 
meat eater. Not even for the one I love most.

I wish I had thought to tell him that it probably the Prozac."

175950630,Here in the U.K. it is harder to find landlords that rent to people on unemployment benefits. They throw in disabled people with the unemployed but a lot of disabled people get more in benefits than all working people working 45 hour weeks at minimum wage. I want to move out of supported housing into my own place and can’t find anywhere. I want a place with a garden and two bedrooms. Some place like this which is £500 a month in rent. London prices would be £2000 a month but I’m in the midlands. image720×960 145 KB Is it difficult to find decent accommodation where you are if on disability benefits ?

175950635,"Part of my recovery is trying to find purpose and to also self discipline myself to stick with something. So I bought a sound kit on a beat production website, it was $20 for the rights to 100 beats/rap instrumentals. I’m going to try to do all 100 of them. Just finished the first one, wanna do 2-3 per day to meet my 6 week deadline. Anyway, It’s just a stupid hobby but it’s to teach me to stick with sht and finish what I start. Only doing that 2-3 hours a day, rest of the time I’m continuing with my accounting “diploma” thing. Probably will start going to the library to study so that I get more comfortable being around people. I just need to stay clean (from alcohol/pot), take my meds, take showers and do the basics everyday and hopefully I can do it. Wish me luck.

174340080,"It’s a partial agonist not an antagonist so you can still feel dopamine flowing through, at least I can at 15mg. I still get excited about things and can do goal oriented activities like programming. I notice during skateboarding that it’s better then Invega, on invega skating feels dull on abilify it’s better. Abilify actually boosts dopamine levels in the mesocortical pathway (too low in sz, causes negative symptoms), and blocks it in the mesolimbic pathway (too high in sz causes neg symptoms). Depending on dopamine levels. Partial agonism can be somewhat compared to a voltage controlled resistor when dopamine is high resistance gets higher, when dopamine is low resistance gets lower. All the AP’s block D2 pathway and most are antagonist meaning even less dopamine get’s through. They act like a non-conductor and block it in both pathways meaning even more negative symptoms. What are you on right now cabra, anything that’s less “Boring”?"

Even if the reality is a simulation as you say, you’re just stagnating repeating the same thing over and over again. This is just like someone preoccupied with death, but instead of saying it ends forever, you’re saying it repeats forever. Boring. I don’t disagree at all, and I prefer thinking of alternate possibilities about existence, but you probably should move past the thought and try to get better. You’re a young smart guy and even if you are not psychotic right now you have some psychological issues to deal with, possibly being obsession with this idea of simulation and other residual beliefs from psychosis."

The other guy slept in a swag and said it kept him warm even winter time. He lit fire and ate can foods. Another guy made himself homeless despite owning a home. I love him but he is a really bad man and he was jealous of me because I could afford to live in the neighbourhood because I got cheaper rent but he couldn’t afford to live here. You can’t have a boyfriend who is jealous of you. He tried to live with me for free but my land lady said no. He lived on a mattress in his garage with his poor dog that he would lock in the garage when he went out. Best sex, passionate, charming and funny but not a very nice person and he li
ed about me etc and he is supposed to be a good Christian yeah right.he killed s dog for barking once. It would be awful to have positive symptoms and be homeless specially Christmas time.

175950655,When I nap I don’t dream. I just wake up and most times it’s like 20 or 30 minutes but you feel like it’s hours. I think it’s perfectly normal. Our meds really can mess up your sleep and for years I had racing thoughts which really made getting to sleep hard for me. Important thing is just sleeping. More the better to a certain extent…
175950656,"Hi _PERSON_, Sorry to hear about the difficulties that you are experiencing. Something that I have found to help me with anxiety is to redirect my energies to something more productive, which helps to refocus and change my thought patterns. It takes a lot time and a lot of work, because negative thoughts are like weeds, you don't have to do anything for them to grow out of control, but to build good ones is like tending a garden, it will take diligent effort.

175950660,"You are probably right that I should either taper off or go all-in and see what it does for me. My pdoc would agree. But for now I have chosen to remain in a “holding pattern” at 100 mg while I try to slay the dragon (or tame it) through some combination of therapy and meditation. If that works well enough, then I will slowly taper off. If it does not work well enough, then I will have to increase the dose (and, if that does not work, then consider trying a different medication). I do not want to taper off the medication now, and then later find that I am going to have to restart it or some other medication, because I find the ramp-up with SSRIs to be very difficult. (Years ago, I started with 10 mg of Lexapro but I could not handle the start up side effects and had to retreat to 5 mg, which eliminated the side effects but also the utility of the medication as it was a sub therapeutic dose — and when I started Zoloft in July, I had similar difficulties getting acclimated to the medication, in
cluding very uncomfortable morning agitation and some amount of insomnia). I agree benzodiazepines are great when really needed. But I am very risk-averse when it comes to potential for dependence, so I use them very rarely."

174340090,"I’ve been criticized by my guardian for not doing more to get more work during my life. It’s a ridiculous way of thinking. In the States schizophrenia carries an 85% unemployment rate, largely due to discrimination. I’m working on a career in freelance web design as a way to work around the _USER_ID_. It’s the only path I see possible, but I also happen to enjoy it. Up until I stood up to my guardian and case worker they had only negative things to say about it. They wanted me to go through the local BVR which I already tried. In the US, by and large, if you’re mentally ill and wish to find work the conventional way, the only way it has a chance of working is if you have depression. It seems like everyone here works, but I’d bet its roughly the same ratio but a lot if us don’t talk about it much. Irl a lot of people simply lie when they feel necessary to get by."

She helps me immensely though - maybe that’s the lead here. It’s a safe place, and if it proves after about nine months,(which is when I usually run out of steam with such things), at least… I’ve ‘emptied my ammunition’ into the ‘side of a tree trunk’ (which is just an expression that I may have not recalled all the way).

175950697,"I would try to find coping skills for the anxiety first. You can start by searching coping skills for anxiety on google. Doctors/psychiatrist are lazy and most of the time. You May also use a therapist who may guide you through different techniques to deal with anxiety. Weigh your options and do your research on meds if to decide to go that route.. If you do not want to take it tell him/her. You have to advocate for yourself. That is one thing most people do not do.

But what’s so different about this time than the other hundred times? I guarantee it will start back up tomorrow.

175950733,one should not use Xanax for sleep for any reason. there are plenty good sleep aids with out resorting to a Xanax. a combo of chamomile capsules and L theine is a effective herbal for mild anxiety. also there is Vistaril and buspar-both non narcotic anxiety meds and the Vistaril is effective as a sleep aid also. the reason drs don't prescribe Xanax much any more is the danger of addiction is very high. even tho you were using yours in a responsible manner-too many others abused theirs and they have cracked down now

Sadly there wasn’t much help for my problem available in the mental health services (they were interested more in “things that would kill you quicker”.) I suggest eating sugar free products, and salt substitutes although they may still mess you up with diabetes (and some will cause a mess in your pants). A past trauma can often be the underlying trigger. I wish you good luck and wish I could be of more help."
175950736,Well yes you can. From simple experiments with sz brains there’s an excess of dopamine. What your saying doesn’t make any scientific sense and I know you want to prove your theories but they aren’t based in reality which is why I think you’d get a lot of advice listening to others here. I think there’s enough evidence that a genetic trigger is getting hit. Solve that and you’ll get the prize as I don’t think your method is bearing any fruit.

But the point is what good are those if there are no one to tell me to comply with medicines or no one to support me taking the medical route or no one to appreciate me about the improvements. In the end and start I am as lonely as any person can be except for Mom wife and son. I am stable now and not sure if I still need to take meds. Since there are not going to be anyone telling me how far I have come from bad patch.

I was denied the first time and I told the doc I thought there were cameras in the waiting room. He told me to point it out to him where exactly the cameras were. I couldn’t do it.

175950757,It seems like it’s more about what is ahead of me that made me take 50-60 blood pressure pills. I thot certain death. I can let go of past pains enough to continue living. I can not handle the loss of every friend I had. And most of my family. My ability to survive on my own financially after losing home to flooding. Closed my cleaning business because of my health. I had my fill of therapist quitting on me or refusing to treat me at all. Even the grief center refused to treat me. It’s the here and now. It’s the future. It just took way more than I had.

I think since you are aware that your thoughts are delusions that good, cause your not so far gone where you cant see clearly. You should work on seeing clearly past the delusions, you have to be strong minded and dont let the delusions take over and think rational when a delusion happens. Dont believe them…"

The Saphris and Topamax act as mood stabilizers, the Rexulti and Cymbalta act as antidepressants and I also take fish oil which helps. Then if I need to I use a full spectrum bulb for 10 to 15 minutes at a time to give me a little boost in mood. It took 7 years to find this combination.

174340124,I know people who didn’t gain weight on it but most do. It’s the 3. strongest antipsychotics after Clozapine and amisulpride and it’s chemically structure is very similarly to Clozapine. Try it for 6 weeks because it’s a very good drug. If you don’t gain weight on it and it wipes out your psychosis. If you start gaining weight on it you must start to exercise and eat lots of veggies and food of whole grains.
175950814,"_AT_MENTION_ thanks. We’ve all had time to process it, but there are still times it brings a tear to my eye. I’m sure you know what I mean I can’t imagine how hard it must have been for you"

So I know a little about the depression you describe. Fortunately, I realized I am falling and took another Zoloft (I am only on a half dose) and it does help. It took me a long time to recognize when I am not doing well. I know that my family member could recover their life if they could just get and accept the right help. They also don't recognize what is going on. In the meantime, all I can do is keep praying about the situation."

174340133,"Well, hi. Not a shrink, can only glean that you have a dx of anxiety and possibly bi polar disorder, or just curious. With this in mind, anxiety is known to be apart of depression, bi polar and others. Depending on the anxiety diagnosis. Bi polar can be 1. bi polar disorder, mania, depressive crashes and psychosis. 2. Can be more depressive, with less mania, can be mixed mood, agitation, me, and within all three you can have episodes of psychosis, rapid cycling and rage, and prolonged hypomania that can cause psychosis. I live with GAD, generalized anxiety disorder, but this is not technically bi polar specific, it is more to do with external situations. Bi polar is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Hope this helps. HT"

175950876,"i used to have it, would have racing thoughts and would get on different unrelated tangents one sentence after the other. could never really have a conversation without expressing random thoughts that i thought were related. that has gone away more or less with meds, as my mind is slowed down and i focus on one topic."
175950877,Thinking about asking for it but the reviews are terrible. Is that just picky first time antipsychotic user or is that med really trash?
175950878,"I just finished my third week of volunteering twice a week. I was a little bit disappointed this week because they only had an hour of work for me on Wednesday and only two hours on Friday. I want to work 8-10 hours a week. Because it’s a hospice office, most people are in and out since they work heavily in peoples’ homes and in assisted living centers. They work with patients most of the time as opposed to being at their desks. I’ve had several people tell me they will give me projects but so far only one thing has happened. Next week, the office manager is on vacation. She’s the one who gives me my work. I’ve e-mailed the volunteer coordinator to see if she can come up with enough work for me to come next Wednesday. With Friday being the day after the July 4th holiday, I am guessing the office will be a ghost town so I am not planning on going that day. Paid job wise, I found a posting for a Cash Management Technician for the city’s Treasurer’s Office. I applied for that, I am fully 
qualified. It doesn’t close until July 12 though, so it will be awhile before I hear anything about that job. I still have the admin job with the fire department and the nursing administrative assistant job out there, plus I am still hoping that the hospice’s parent company contacts me about the two jobs I applied for up there. It’s been two weeks. The volunteer coordinator has offered to put in a good word for me, but I don’t think she has yet. She is going to be my third reference I needed for most jobs, so that’s a good thing. I’m really glad I started volunteering. It gives me a lot of confidence that I can go back to work full-time. I know I am working only a small fraction of full-time, but the important thing is that I am driving independently, running with projects with only minimal supervision, and interacting with a variety of personality types. I am doing really well so far. I am looking forward to finding a regular job now and I’m no longer afraid of what it will be like. I have the 
Zyprexa to thank for that! I haven’t had any paranoia in this office, which is a big difference from my last two jobs. That was my most disabling problem, and the Zyprexa all but eliminates it. I am ready to work again."

175950882,"I personally consider anti-depressant dangerous. I don’t know, but a lot of people commit suicide while on anti-depressants, and then there is always the argument did they do it because they already were depressed or did the ad have something to do with it? I was on remeron(ad) a little while. It gave me a weird and false sense of lifted mood. I quit only after a few days because it made me feel estranged from myself. I would get in touch with your doc asap and maybe discuss lowering your dose or switch to another ad. You are not supposed to feel this way, so that probably means you need to make a adjustment. But whatever you do, don’t quit cold turkey, unless you only have been on them for a very short while. I would discuss getting gradually off them with your doc. Hang in there, things can definitly get better."
175950883,"What about with voices that sound like they could be real, e.g.: what sounds like the neighbors when I’m sitting on my balcony?"
175950884,"I’m sorry I haven’t been on here or AC much. I’m really sorry. I have been on WoW sometimes but in general I’m just trying to work on bettering myself and my relationship in real life. It sucks cuz I’ve let myself go in all ways. Physically, mentally, emotionally... and even with things around the house since I lost my job. I didn’t realize how bad it was or how bad I’ve gotten and it makes me depressed. Very depressed. Something’s gotta change. Which is why I’m doing this noom/Sanvello thing and just yea. I’m cutting out alcohol today. I put that in my I Am Sober app. I may have to cut off my therapist. I can’t afford her at 70 per session. I never really could. I feel completely defeated in my real life. And I’ve deleted a bunch of people including family members from my fb and just people who don’t like me or don’t deserve to see my success or even failures. I also need to get off social media so much. I hate that. Either that or when I do post keep it like not so muc
h info about my personal life. Idk. I don’t count PC as social media, rather as a peer support group/forum. So I will be here, tho."
175950885,I was going to her that one too maybe once I finish this one it looks amazing
175950886,"Oh GOD YES. I don’t miss that at all. Too many things you can’t unsee, right? It’s just hard to fit in here because I don’t feel like I’m miserable enough now. I really am enjoying my life."
175950887,I would wonder about depression also. Whenever I’m depressed I need in excess of 12 hours of sleep to feel satisfied. Even then I still feel tired. I think talking to your pdoc is a good idea.
175950888,"People say attention seeking like it’s a bad thing. Seeking attention, specifically medical attention, is what you are SUPPOSED to do when you are sick. If someone called the ambulance for a sprained ankle, would you criticize them for wasting resources and going to a doctor? I mean, sprains technically CAN heal on their own. But we know that proper medical intervention can lead to shorter recovery time, and fewer long-term complications."

175950894,I honestly don't know. It probably wouldn't change anything. I just... I hate not knowing things or having answers and obsessing about things I don't know. I like having nice little neat labels and clear answers for things. And when it's stuck on my mind I can't not think about it and feel it's going to change everything and answer all my questions.
175950895,"Oh cool, it’s good to hear that from someone else who is on the same medicine. The original goal was to take away the voices and it didn’t really do that, just reduced them, but it fixed a lot of problems I wasn’t able to put words to. I used to complain on the forum about that “where am I” or “I feel lost” feeling before I got put on Zyprexa."
175950896,"I’ve tried L tyrosine and it makes me have more energy but also more agitation. I tried L dopa for a while too all while still on an AP. L dopa just makes me agitated. I didn’t notice a difference. I’ve never tried 5HTP but I don’t want to just because of this chart I found online. It looks likes brain chemistry is a really complicated balancing act, but I’m always trying to find natural ways to self medicate."

174340147,"I started getting osteoarthritis at 18 from my pregnancies, then at 22 started AP and it spread like wildfire over the years. My last xrays and MRI show it is so severe, I look worse than my 70 year old Grama did just before she died. It’s in my spine, pelvis, both hips, and complete lower back. They said damage is done, no way to prevent anything more and my cane is gonna be my friend for years. I’m going to a pain management for my RSD in April, but they said they’re gonna take the arthritis into account if we decide on pain meds, cause for RSD it’s usually nerve deadening injections every 2 weeks for life, and I refuse those cause I’d be left immobile. So pain meds are the only option along with my TENS unit, which helps only the small area covered, and only the hour it’s on. Can’t use that all day every day ya know."

174340146,"I don’t have positive or negative symptoms anymore, and I know for sure they are never coming back, but I cant seem to get out of the mindset that there is something wrong about my life. Like just under half my life I have had sz and I find it really hard to just pretend it never happened. I think I am relient on meds, but at the same time, I don’t think I really have sz if I keep taking them. I just kind of have the mindset that I am a bit messed up."
175950916,"I've asked myself that but I don't think so. I don't even know if I would tell her if I did relapse. It's more of my parents and the Pastor _PERSON_ and somewhat my Regular T putting a lot of pressure on me to not do X. I think I am ready to be discharged. I am going to miss her because she is super positive and encouraging and I will miss that, but the last call we had was only like 10-15 minutes long because I'm meeting all the goals. There wasn't anything else to say. And when there is nothing to say it's time to go. So I will be okay without her. I'll just miss her. I just feel all this pressure like I did before I was hospitalized. And I know I can't do X because I will make a mess of it and have to go to the ER and risk being hospitalized again. I can't trust myself to do X so I really need to keep myself in line but all the pressure I'm feeling isn't helping me do that. I kind of need my parents and my Pastor _PERSON_ and my Regular T to back off a bit and not be so pushy about it. But on th
e other hand, it's like the first time my parents have ever really addressed it also. So I don't want to discourage that. I just need to get used to having so much pressure. Or find a polite way to tell them, enough is enough. IDK. I'm feeling a bit better now that I've talked through it some here on PC. And I talked to someone at work. I just gotta learn to chill more. _PERSON_"

174340154,Does it cause any memory problems
175950924,Definitely! If only it weren’t in the 90s without AC. Then I’d do even more. I just cooked up some chicken for my husband. I cleaned my daughters room. And I did some laundry. Now I’m sitting in front of a fan.
175950925,sounds thrilling.

175950927,I believe I see flashes of the future. But the future is out of our control. So no _AT_MENTION_ I dont think you caused that kid to crash. It’s also not odd to think that a bike would crash so I think it was a coincidence that that crossed your mind right before he crashed.
175950928,I'm just going nuts with all the **** in my head. Why don't people leave me alone about my sexuality? I don't need to explain anything to anyone. But they persist on me having a gf or a bf. Sexuality is as complicated as quantum physics or genetics. I identify as asexual but people want to tease me. I want to do a geometry course and read but I needed to rest and take a nap.. But I don't even sleep when I take naps so is it really a nap? I don't think it's meditation either. My mom is so dramatic and stresses herself out. My sister is going to leave to university and I can't even focus. It's all ****_NAME_ up. I'm sick of it. I'm trying really hard. I don't know if I should just let go of trying to hold onto my sanity and just go psychotic.. YES - It's possible to prolong sanity and go psychotic later instead of sooner!! Just like a person that is dying and needs to talk to their family before they let go of life and die the next day!! The mind is a powerful thing!!

I am a lacto-ovo-vegetarian and prepare my own meals with lots of mushrooms for the ergothioneine. I exercise daily. I practice Buddhism. I try to read as much as I can.

I have my DNA sequenced by a firm called _NAME_ Labs. My DNA is supposed to be sequenced completely or almost completely. The problem is that I have the raw data in files and extensions I don’t know. I also have a DNA explorer where I can find any locus and theoretically search for alele variants or mutations I suppose. I am interested in knowing about risk genes for COMT, MTHFR, NRG1, ErbB4, AKT, DAOA, mGluR3, Dysbindin, DISC1, CHRNA7, and another more, but I don’t know how to know what allelic variants I have for these genes. I asked for a personal report at _NAME_ Labs, geneticoncept, wegene… which I read here in the forum is where you find answers for example to your genetic predisposition to have low folate levels. The only lab that replied is wegene and told me that they can’t give me this information donno why. Can anybody help

175950987,Thank you for the advice
175950988,"I don’t believe I have sza, but I take my meds anyway. They help me with my religious issues and personality issues. If I had sza, meds would make the men following me and recording me go away. But meds don’t do that. I’ve tried like 10 different APs. But I still only believe in supplements as just that - something to supplement meds. There’s also this voice in the back of my head that says if everyone thinks I’m psychotic maybe I am. So I take my meds. I just wish meds made everything stop. The animals and birds talk to me and I like that I’ve decided and I hope that no med takes that away someday. Just take your meds. Some meds make your mind clearer and that can be really helpful, even if it doesn’t make all your issues and symptoms go away. So take your meds."

I am of sound mind (I think) enough to be able to recognise when to go quietly.
175950993,"hi _NAME_…thanks for your reply. Since 2006 I have been on a downward slide. There were a few spans of time when i was able to function better but overall, i’m not the person i used to be. I am getting worse. it is possible that there is something else complicating the picture…like early onset dementia or Alzheimer. I have ZERO short term memory and this radically diminishes my level of functioning. A group home would probably be best. I lived in one for years when i was young and hated it…but back then was in heavy denial about my illness and my limitations. Now I would be grateful for it, not hate it. sadly, the state I live in and especially the county I live in have almost no public services and benefits for people with MH issues. The state hospital I was looking at is in NJ (I live in PA) and requires a person to be an NJ resident for 12 mos. My dad lives in NJ but it is doubtful that he would let me live with him for that long. This hospital has 12 cottages where people live indefinit
ely. It was my hope to get something like that…"

My brother was in jail with native americans and then I went in to see them and there was this machine making pizza and there was so much explosives and exploding stuff. I was on the beach in the bahamas and people were cutting off each others heads and it costed 3 million dollars to buy a hotel room. I was told on reddit that lowering my injection could help with AP induced negative symptoms EPS. I went to book an appointment for job searching and this guy made me feel really uncomfortable.. he was like ""What are you doing?"" etc like screw him I wanted to talk to the woman that I talk to all the time.

Two days a week I exercise with 32lb dumbbells: shoulder shrugs 3 sets of 15 reps, side bends 3 sets of 15 reps, standing shoulder press 3 sets of 15 reps, biceps curl 3 sets of 8 reps, one arm back row 2 sets of 15 reps, triceps extension 2 sets of 8 reps. Two days a week I go to the gym: I train my core muscles with the maximum of the machines. Three days a week I exercise two times twenty minutes on my Concept2 rowing machine. Also I try to walk some every day. And sometimes I do (which I can recommend) YouTube seated senior _PERSON_ with _NAME_.

I’m supposed to go workout at 11:30 but I might cancel because it’s gonna be tight getting these guys on the road. Then once they’re off, I need to put my house back in order. It’s been a fun but very exhausting visit. What are you doing today? Did you get everything you wanted for Christmas?"
175951006,"I dont think this is a good way of thinking. Your thoughts are simply untrue, no matter what you call them - OCD, sz, philosophy. And even without going into a discussion about thruth, i think these thoughts are harmful and they are not doing you or anyone any good."

175951014,"Appointment with Dr today... We all know what he said. Take the buspar 5mg bid. Continue w Prozac 60mg. He said if I was too scared to take the buspar, I could bump Prozac up to 80mg a day but then I'm at max dose and there is no more tweaking the Prozac. I have the Prozac and the buspar sitting on the counter. I'm actually staring at them. Today, I've been fairly calm. Not much anger or annoyance, no more anxiety than the average day. So I stare at the pills and say, do I take them now or do I wait to see if I really need them? Maybe I won't have anger outbursts or nails on chalkboard shivers of annoyance when someone is crunching food or breathing heavily or... Then I think back to the two times I have been taken off my ssris. I did well for a few months and thought, hot darn I'm better, I don't need meds. And then the world would slowly start to crumble around me. I did it twice before I realized, this is forever for me. Time to accept ssris and benzos will always be part of my daily life. So, m
e thinking that I won't have the anger outbursts is ridiculous. Even if they didn't happen today, they will happen again. I'll work up to the 5mg bid. I'll take a half a tablet tonight with my Prozac and then another half tomorrow morning. Then maybe by tomorrow night I'll be able to take the whole 5mg. I think that sounds good. All right, down the hatch they go."

But when my abuser passed away, a lot of the pain and anger and guilt and worry went with him so I’ve gotten to do a lot of healing and I can talk about it now and I hope others will find their way through their pain. The reduction in PTSD symptoms has lessoned my psychosis greatly. It was all very triggering. I would get just lost to it and be lost in my mind for days.

175951079,That’s EXACTLY how I feel too. But when I read my manuscript of my journey with mental illness I realise that I’m not faking it. Until the next time. Then I have to read it again and again to convince myself I’m not faking it. Alien the spirit in my head yells at me I’m a fake and a hypocrite. Gives me a lot of distress. My pdoc has lost patience in trying to reassure me I have sza. So now I come on here. _AT_MENTION_-Cotton you are not alone. I’m sorry you have started to experience these symptoms so young. When I was 15 my sza wasn’t quite fully there but I started hearing voices and having severe panic attacks. Diagnosed with sza first time in hospital in 2003 when I was nearly 19
175951080,Yes very much so. Even the community tried banning together to get me kicked off the bus because the kids that bullied me ran home to their parents and spread lies about me. It was a small hick town and I had just moved there…they said I was a bi-sexual Satan worshipper because I dressed goth. This was the 90’s and I fit in like a sore thumb. My mother had to go to the school and talk to the administration. The bullying didn’t stop though. I hated that school with a passion. I later quit and got my GED.

There was a bonfire party in my early 20’s where everyone got naked and danced around the fire. I did too. Then this geek came to one of our parties and had heard of people getting naked and persuaded people to. People ended up making out with each other including my ex girlfriend so I wasn’t happy with that. He just wanted to get some/see girls naked which wasn’t the point of the original nudity party.

174340189,Why do you think you have autism as your primary diagnosis? Obviously you have a mood disorder or antidepressants wouldn’t have made you go bananas! I’m almost positive that your previous doctors were correct to have diagnosed you with bipolar disorder _AT_MENTION_. Antidepressants are like pouring gasoline over a fire to most people diagnosed with some form of bipolar disorder. This is also true for some people diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type.
175951153,"I dunno…might end up in jail. There will definitely be consequences if you do though, so don’t do that."
174340187,"There is definitely a solution! Please don’t kill yourself. A short theory for why this happens is that the schizophrenic brain is inflamed enough to generate excessive amounts of adrenaline, which oxidizes to adrenochrome, leading to psychedelic experiences like thought broadcasting, hallucinations, or ideas of reference. The solution appears to be dealing with the symptoms directly, as with antipsychotics and maybe Amyloban 3399 (thread here ) and doing what you can to repair the blood brain barrier, so that brain inflammation can be minimized, and symptoms can diminish. My favourite approach to stabilizing the blood-brain barrier is “hydrogen water”, which this study shows is effective for that. It also reduces TBARS, which are the biomarker for inflammation, by 43%, which is pretty huge (study here. ) Other means of stabilizing the blood-brain barrier are wheat avoidance (wheat increases the amount of zonulin protein, which disrupts the gut lining and blood-brain barrier, making them more 
permeable), dairy avoidance, soda / junk food avoidance, and eating more fresh fruit and veg. These are anti-inflammatory, pro-antioxidant approaches. I’ve been pursuing that kind of life for 2 and 1/2 months, and my recovery is pretty pronounced. My chronic headache is around 1/4th as bad as before, and my voices fluctuate from being totally mute, to barely audible (depending on how inflamed my brain feels.) Today my brain inflammation felt pretty good, so I haven’t plateaued. The amount of “secret messages” I’ve been receiving has declined since pursuing that anti-neuroinflammation lifestyle. It also helps to have noise-isolating headphones (love Bose Quietcomfort 20s) and minimize live TV / live radio time. I just listen to pre-recorded stuff, and my “secret message” episodes are minimized."

ability as opposed to ""all or nothing"" / 100% vs 0% I think research has a standard of reliability of something like .70 or .80 (don't trust me on the exact numbers) So if they had something like .68 when it needed to be .70 and they got impatient or dishonest about the .02 does that mean there was absolutely nothing further to explore? ^ (Again maybe I'm out of my depths on how this translates into real research. By all means, feel free to correct me). Have all research findings always been successful in first their go? And do they dismiss anything that isn't? ^ Or, are reevaluations of their methods, and even changes in theories and hypotheses, not part of the scientific method? Have other researchers ever looked at where someone else failed miserably with a concept and picked up from there for some reason or another? ^ I thought that was one of the reasons people publish their methods and findings even when they fail... Do scientists ever start searching for one thing and find something else of equal val
ue? Has it ever taken years or even decades to get results in research? Because I thought the answers to my questions were ""yes"" Fear and censorship sometimes stops people from looking at things that have been discredited Nothing wrong with asking questions It's when people get threatened by questions that we have a problem.

My janitor crew and even my supervisors and myself get so tired and stressed at the end of the day and people can’t keep it together and they start “Losing their religion” and they blurt out insulting stuff like they can’t control themselves. Today me and my co-worker for the past four years were talking right before he left. He looked friendly and smiled and started a seemingly innocent conversation about when he was in band in high school. I saw where he was going with this almost immdielty. He mentioned weight and I’m overweight. And I started looking him right in the eyes because like I said, co-workers tend to get mean and insulting when they’re tired and stressed and he was going on about how overweight people get as they age. I’m a little sensitive about my weight as anyone else would be and his story was building and he said something like, “And some people get fat”. I should say here that I’ve worked with this guy a tot
al of 5 years. He makes an odd first impression on people because his appearance is odd. He’s abnormally skinny and wears glasses and looks like a steriotypical geek or nerd. But I’ve always been careful about seeing past that and treating him as a normal person but I know he looks down on me. He thinks he’s better than me so when he was building up his fat story and I timed it perfectly and I interrupted and said, “Yeah, and some people are freakishly thin.” And as an added bonus my boss who insults me was walking by when I said it and he is too thin too and I directed it at both of them. Both of them shut up and looked flustered. We will all probably keep getting along but it felt so good to give them their well -deserved commuppance. Hey, my neighbors torture me but all my mean stuff I’ve learned from yelling at them finally came in handy. I had to have hurt both their feelings I don’t care how tough they are. Good.

175951185,"I think you should keep trying to farm, you can’t run the home, or take after your sister without your lively hood. Focus on getting healthier, and stronger, smarter, so you can run the farm, afford to keep the house, and help your sister. That’s just my 2c though. I know whatever you do, you will work hard at it, and try your best."

175951186,But I mean nobody can offer me help as it is a matter of willpower…the positive is that I am taking care of my health better but neglecting my finance
175951187,i’m working on the other two first though. soda is last on the list. Although really it is a addiction for me.
175951188,That’s my answer to those who would use me.
175951189,"better to try i guess, i know i cant handle stress very well right now i was hospitalised after doing 4 hrs in a cafe among other things"
175951190,I get it. I took the bear path multiple times. I did worse. I only left when i knew he would hurt my kid. Which was way too late. I feel guilt to my kid. Some experiences make people trust bears and fear bunnies or confuse the two.
175951191,The only change I have noticed is the insomnia returned. I guess it'll take 3 weeks to adjust to the new dose and be able to sleep well.

175951195,I’m so sorry _AT_MENTION_ . I hope you’re doing OK. Take care.
174340200,What did the Drs say? It could be because you stopped the Abilify especially since you were fine on Sertraline before when you were on Abilify.
174340202,I take risperidone and had no ejaculation. But I added Abilify and my ejaculation came back. But the problem with Abilify for me is that it decreases sex drive. So even when I’m intimate with my girlfriend it’s boring compared to risperidone. So Abilify gave me my ejaculation back but the sex is just boring.
175951196,This sounds like an awful lot to deal with. I get really overwhelmed sometimes too. Please don’t hurt yourself though. You can get through this.

175951202,"Thanks, crocodal! <3"
174340203,More needs to be discussed about the potential treatment of Niacin. Dr. _PERSON_ was a Canadian scientist that treated patients with high doses of vitamin B3 (Niacin) and vitamin C. Vitamin D3 and folate are also important for those of us with schizophrenia. My psychiatrist here in France noticed the fact I tended to deteriorate towards the end of the year so perhaps taking D3 supplements could help with this problem. It is similarly referred to as S.A.D. (Seasonal affective disorder).
175951203,"I argue with mine, trying to reason with them so they’ll go away. Sometimes I’ll say something aloud in response. The random phrases and words scare me though."

175951207,"We’re at the start of a phased re-opening where I live. The restrictions have been partially lifted, but we have the COVIDIOTS racing out and clumping up dangerously in defiance of the remaining restrictions. They’re not wearing masks, getting in people’s space, and ignoring limits on people in spaces. I know it’s not nice, but I’m hoping that many of them get deathly ill. I do think we need to start to re-open as the point of the lockdown was to slow the infection rate and not stop it (that’s unrealistic), but I’m sick and tired of the “muh freedoms!” and “it’s a plandemic!” morons beaking off when it’s obvious that we’ve had more deaths and illnesses than we would from a regular flu."

174340201,"I given a youtube video in first post detailing about dmg, its benefits etc. Its a thoroughly researched supplement. It can readily cross blood brain barrier and gives instant results which can last full day or more. I personally find it very mood uplifting, increases processing speed, helps to multitask etc thus overall improves cognition. Puts anxiety, anger and other emotions in control thus helps to function better in stressful situations. For workout it eliminates post workout soreness. Increases libido, erection etc thus it have no side effect like antidepressants and also not affect memory, no memory recall issue like other drugs. Thus its actually a magic pill and thought of sharing with forum users who not aware of this magic remedies like this other than rx prescription pills which have tons of side effects."

175951218,I am not in debt but don’t have much money put aside. I had $700 put aside for emergencies but have to pay excess for my hysterectomy so I might not have that money anymore. I do love to buy things. I try to buy well and I don’t regret what I buy often but I have bought Christmas gifts. I spent about $50 each on my closest ones. I just spent some of my food money on a magazine for my friend. He smiles an. He smokes but he was always so good to me and when he had more money than me he would shout me pizzas. I need to start saving some money instead of spending. I need emergency money set aside if my animals need to see a vet or if my car needs fixing. Or if I get a big bill. I want to have Botox and fillersbut can’t afford it right now. I don’t wear much makeup.isually just lipstick most days. I love my food and spend a lot on food. I love shopping too but I’m not worried about my spending at the moment.
175951219,I’m very sorry you are going through this. Like other members said don’t make a rushed decision and just wait and see what comes to your mind when you are calm and collected.
175951220,when they want to punish they punish me even if i am taking meds at high doses that what drives me insane
175951221,"I’m gaining conviction and I am filled with excitement for it all. I owe a lot to health and recovery. And this site, for being able to get out some of my thoughts out and see them. So this morning I formulated the question into google: ‘volunteering in (blank) township’, and there’s oodles of things for me to digest, first. So far it’s speak about ‘committees’ and ‘boards’, so of course knowing me I now have a critique on some of the verbiage! Ahaha. I am so ready though, and am like a ‘coiled spring’ for giving back, NOW. I never really left my hometown save for college and a few stints having my own apartment. I won’t beat the drum and chest pound about what I’ve managed so far But I’ve scratched at this concept in my past (and it’s telling to me now) and this is before I consciously knew it was an ‘ache’ or ‘itch’ in me. What really ‘gets me’ going and what I have a lot of bias for, is food insecurity in the schools, I presume it occurs somehow, someway
, across the board. So I’m ‘willing and able’ to give SOME and even will be posIng a question soon to the right people [if]: I can break bread, too (with parents? Or the child in question?) and interface SOME with those I aim to help. (To fill bellies a little better and do some good talking/sharing about _USER_ID_ since they no doubt get that even before they know the word for it.) My money is where my mouth is on this. I’ll be keeping the forum in the know, like a commitment, because I think it’s going to heal me further, as well. I will execute though and am treating this post as again a commitment to do more, get out more, etc., etc."
175951222,Hope you will be okay _AT_MENTION_. Sending you positive energy.

175951228,I’m a stickler for doing the same thing everyday and every now and then I’ll miss a dose. Not so bad for most meds but some really do make you feel it. Pill box is good. Luckily out here a lot of our packaged meds come with days on them like womens birth control pills in some markets. Really makes a difference when you see that you missed one. Saying that. Pill box really good.

174340206,That’s awesome. well done on your recovery. I found a review that found that most schizophrenics are deficient in vitamin d and folic acid.
175951235,Sorry you aren’t feeling great. People kind of suck
175951237,"You may enjoy the show ‘Evil’, it’s a rare diversion for me. The lead actress is in the psychology field and was an expert witness before moving into a new job that is religion oriented(as a skeptic). I’m not doing it justice but _NAME_ plays an evil expert witness in addition. The actors have good chemistry and the writing is good. I have a crush on the female lead, but her repertoire of expressions is sort of like nothing I’ve seen before. I know this is a leap from your OP, but I seem to engage in “metaphorical word salad.” I hope _NAME_ faces justice, of course,"

It will be full of veggies, carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, snow peas and green onions and I’ll add some tofu. I will see how many calories a bowl comes out to but I think I’ll be able to have another slimfast too. myfitnesspal has me at 1200 calories a day but I think that’s too low. We’ll see how it works though. Wish me luck."

175951244,I thought I was from the bloodline from _NAME_ to _NAME_ to Jesus who also had children. That was a terrible delusion and only meds was able to break that spell. I hear you on the ego. My ego was so shattered it felt like it lost all elasticity… If you understand when I explain it that way. The ego negotiate for us a place between the superego and the id in an attempt to find the ego ideal. For me the ego ideal is where we find consciousness… Not in a fallen or broken ego. I have had uncountable philosophies on this but decided to abstain from it because it fueled my delusions in my pre-medicated days. I can relate to some of your delusions. I’m also on Abilify

175951247,"I’m trying to be grateful for all that I have. And not compare myself to others who may have done more or excelled better in my circumstances. Every day is a new battlefield. If I don’t get everything on my to do list done by the end of the day, I feel like a failure. And so, I feel like a failure every day. But I love life too much to just off myself. I love so much art and so many people. But everyday is like a slap in the face, with endless self flagellation about what I did or did not get accomplished. I’m reading a book that says this productivity mindset is a strictly American disorder. I just look at the wreckage of the last few years of my life and wonder, why did it have to be this way, and why me? Why can’t I contribute the way I very much want to? What’s holding me back? Is it my expectations, or is it my performance? Or both? Every day I end up sobbing or wallowing in self pity. Every day I think, tomorrow will be perfect. I just can’t deal with these crushing feelings anymo
re. Why should I be constantly tormented by the question, “what’s wrong with me?” I feel like far less than what I’m expecting should be enough. Even though I’ve had every advantage, I feel fundamentally as though life is unfair."

174340214,"Living with schizophrenia is going to give you all the trouble you can handle. Drugs will just add trouble you don’t need. Last I checked, cocaine is still illegal; mostly it’s a felony if you get caught. That should be an incentive to avoid it. People on this thread already covered the terrible affect drugs can have on your schizophrenia. But it’s the peripheral crap that goes along with doing drugs that could send your life down the tubes maybe permanently. First of all, schizophrenics as a group abuse drugs a lot more than the general population. This means that your chances of getting addicted are way more than the average person. You might tell yourself, “Well, it could never happen to me”. I grew up in an affluent city in a middle class family. When I got ill at 19 with schizophrenia I was in a few hospitals and group homes that were really nice in nice areas. In my illness I had cars, I went to college, I was mostly employed, I didn’t date much but I took out a few women who were 
way out of my league but very nice. But despite my background, at age 26 I tried crack and cocaine and fell in love with them. I started out doing them infrequently but in a matter of months my use of both of them escalated and I became addicted. I did both of them every chance I got for the next four years. That’s where most of my money went. And they almost wrecked my life permanently. I eventually got clean in 1990 and haven’t touched drugs or alcohol since. But earlier I used the word “peripheral”. By that, I mean the hassle, trouble, and danger of obtaining drugs. Most drug dealers are not nice, caring, empathetic, honest people to their customers. They cheat and lie to people and these are the people who you have to get your drugs from and you usually find them in the worst, dangerous places and those are the exact places that are going to cause you trouble and cause a hassle and complication in your life. I know you might not be doing drugs every day or even every week but drug use and the life
style that goes along with it is as insidious as schizophrenia and you start off by smoking a couple joints and a few lines but the odds that your use will grow are very, very high as a schizophrenic. And you’re in that world often before you realize it. So yeah, you can avoid all the trouble drugs bring by just stopping now. Drugs will complicate your life. You just don’t need that. Instead of spending your time and money on drugs just go to a movie or out to eat or go to the zoo or a bar mitzava or a strip club or something, lol. Anything but drugs!"

174340252,I would say that residual schizophrenics likely still bare symptoms… but are not at risk of relapse even without medication. Or otherwise they exist almost only in a re-missive state where their illness is not a factor on there capacity to feel attached and actualized within their lives. It is likely a deprecated term that never had an real use on the medical community. We get diagnosed and are given the most scant of chances at recovery… our illness is a mystery… but telling us that only makes it worse. That’s just my my speculations… the sense I’d make of it. Was once schizophrenic… but now is not… though there is a trace of the occurrence… (In a more literal sense of the word ‘residual.’)

174340247,That’s fairly broad but I’ll do my best to answer completely. My main concern is to find out if my thoughts and emotions and beliefs and feelings are something that I should be concerned about and possibly medicated for. I’ve has issues most of my life in a variety of ways and never been able to get a definitive answer or reason. Im trying to learn and understand as much as I can in the hope of preventing the breakdowns I’ve experienced a few times in the past. I have a lot of “symptoms” which at surface level appear to fit very well to the description of sz but I thought it would be a good idea to speak with people that have more specific experience and knowledge about the condition.

175951461,"I feel like psychosis has caused me to lose an important connection with most of the rest of humanity. The things I suffered from before my psychotic break seemed universal so it was easy for me to find comfort in relating to fellow sufferers. Anxiety was my main problem, and most of my friends have it, so I could always turn to them for advice on dealing with it which made things so much easier. (I don’t say this to downplay anxiety; I know firsthand how horrible it is. It’s just that it’s also pretty common, unfortunately.) No one in my life outside of my medical team knows how to handle psychosis, however. Sometimes, in moments of irrationality, I wonder if even my medical team can help me that much, since they don’t have firsthand experience of what I went through. I realize they must have their degrees for a reason, though, so most of the time I’m willing to work with them, but still, firsthand experience counts for so much with stuff like this in my opinion. I’m afraid to step out 
of my comfort zone in regards to socializing because I don’t want to deal with the uncomfortable questions that will inevitably pop up, the ones about how I spent my early twenties, why I don’t have a degree, why I can’t seem to hold down simple jobs, etc. I shouldn’t let scenarios I brew up in my mind dictate my life, though. It’s likely more people would be understanding than I think, and let’s say they do decide to avoid me – it’s not like I’d then be any more isolated than I am now. Generally speaking, since psychosis, life is, at best, uncomfortable for me. Exceptions to this rule are when I’m doing something I really enjoy, like cherishing special moments with my beloved, laughing at a funny video, spending time with my pets, etc. I’ve been holding out for things to get better and I’m not averse to waiting longer but man, I’m hoping for a lucky break soon, lol. I’m back in therapy (I’ll probably show this to my therapist at my next visit) and I’m going to switch APs soon 
because I suspect risperidone has been making me a big depressed lately. I’m trying out a healthier lifestyle but I don’t feel as though it’s had an effect on my mood yet; I’m giving it time. To boil down this rant, I want to focus on being thankful for all I have, and quietly put to rest the yearning for what I no longer do. What are your guys’ ways to combat bitterness and practice gratitude? As always, I appreciate you for reading!"

175951464,not really but i am so mad not working so long i cant even do basic math in my head anymore.
175951465,"I have memories which are often called delusions. I have perceptions and recall and stuff all the time especially when dreaming. I’ve seen history change for the worse and for the better all the time. I remember some major news headlines like “We live in a simulation” and interacted with more people in my other lives. I was a victim largely and I had a huge victim mentality for the longest time. Obviously there is no proof unless one can detect space-time anomalies lol and I don’t think they can. I think someone or somebody put the simulation on repeat and I’m trapped in the year they sent me back which is around the time I got schizophrenia or afterwards via space-time or soul time travel into my body backwards in time… I also think I was a computer simulator in a past life and I am being eternally punished which is a strange belief obviously. I believe I used to be a legitimate lab rat and actual time traveler in a past life. I have no money or anything except my memories and sadness 
and trauma in most lives. I never took a physics course yet I have good intuition on the subject when it comes to theoretical ideas. I think there’s a learning process and there is some hope of escape after the universe ends or I die, but I keep coming back. I have my faith in God but it only does so much. I’ve probably been rich, invented some stuff and was famous so I escaped and had ‘privilege’ and stuff but it doesn’t mean anything anymore and I’m stuck here. I don’t think anyone can escape the simulation unless they wanted one to escape or they let them escape. I did before. They told me why. I also think there’s some psychological games going on with the aliens like they messed with my mind and confused the hell out of me. I often read into and look into fiction like PKD sci-fi stuff because I felt like I met and talked to PKD in a distant past life and told him stuff and even was VALIS one time lol… It seems my life went down hill or I got stuck in a time loop at university in my orig
inal life or was put in an artificial simulation after I possibly died (I believe this)…I often think God made me insane and aliens are protecting me or ??????? with me depending on the ‘day’ or time. I wish I never went to university especially that one and I hated the place where I lived. I think in my original life I tried or joined ROTC there and I don’t know what happened to me. I had a psychotic break and posted stuff on Facebook and I believe I was ‘targeted’ since then (over a trillion lifetimes ago). Sort of like a time travel program there but I was a victim… Like I have been cloned and even been a doppelganger due to reincarnation and new lives. I often think I’m in an artificial world or computer program. I often went back to that university to finish my degree, but since have got the common sense and intelligence to never return there for my own safety. I’m often to scared to go back to any school even online. I often remember ‘portals’, ‘wormholes’ and especially Mars. 
I often watch movies and TV shows and think they’re about me or more realistically I think I relate to them loosely. I don’t know if I posted I was “_NAME_” in another life; I created Bitcoin (without knowledge and without knowing and that’s why I died); or I upset the wrong people or powerful people. That place was crazy and wacky and a lot of weirdos and crazy people in the area. I initially wanted to join the military in my original life but got schizophrenia. I probably wouldn’t have made it or succeeded due to my major, average intelligence, and addiction to monster drinks. I was physically poor and unfit and weak. There must of been a miscommunication going on and my life was ruined and destroyed by some ‘mk-ultra’ type stuff in every life and alien contact on my part via soul/consciousness transfer back in time. Sometimes, I even went back in time to the very exact point I got psychosis from marijuana back around August 27th 2011. I often had delusions about the Mayan Prophecies and how 
we live in a computer program or simulation now. I guess I was called a super soldier or something and I might have micro-chips but that’s based on past life information I recalled. I don’t know and it’s possible some of it isn’t real, I guess. The worst memory I have was being taken out of my Coop-room and returned. It looked like some SSP type stuff and when I came back I had memories of Mars and crap. But why me? What did I do to deserve this? Why would they take a normal college student like myself? I have since lost most of my memories of the incidents and cannot tell or distinguish between reality and fantasy because of parallel universes/different timelines. I lost consciousness and had black outs and went missing I think but was returned. I don’t know. Thank you for listening."

175951482,"Yeah I kind of have mixed feeling like this too, even about this forum. Its all about knowing where you fit in. I know that Im not meant to fit in with the normal people, and its comforting reading various posts because I feel like I can relate to that. Then I also feel that mayby I should continue to try my best to leave this all behind me and move forward as much as I can."
174340259,"My delusions were pretty bad. Probably exacerbated by several caffeinated beverages per day like low-carb monster energy drinks. I guess low-carb is better than high carb and high sugar for diabetes and stuff. The addiction might be worse because of partial agonists like I read here. It’s hard. It’s one of my biggest struggles. It causes the meds to be inefficient and not work sometimes even though there is little evidence besides my family and I noticing and thinking that. My worst delusions are I’m stuck living as a schizophrenic with delusions and derealization and depersonalization for near infinity in an endless loop while questioning if I live in a simulation. I worry about certain things like grey aliens and the deep state targeting me for unknown paranoid reasons like me being a psychic or time traveler or alien or something along those lines. I feel like I was targeted at college in 2010-2011 while drunk or high and then figured out it was my genetics after many years and lifetimes. 
Like I got alien or vampire genetics which means I’m not entirely human… My horrendous, sad, and horrific reality and delusion consists of me being murdered, tortured as well as my family for unknown reasons caused by my loss of contact with reality and intense psychosis. That I talked too much ???? and exposed myself as a computer simulator, _NAME_, and other people. That I remember the images and pain and suffering over and over again countless times for many years and that I died at a young age in my 20s. There was some good things like beautiful women courting me and stuff like that but that is 1 in a billion odds now. I still remember the good times. I am 100% convinced I was a Montauk Boy for unknown sinister, sick reasons. In the first past lives I had, I thought it was my step-father who gave me schizophrenia because he worked for the government years ago, a long time ago. But the aliens said it was because I was _NAME_ from Austria and was the first autistic person in a past life and they were ex
perimenting on me to try to figure out what I was. I don’t even know if the wiki information on Frits V. is even right. I remember a dreamlike painful existence and memories of meeting _NAME_ and being a patient at his hospital in one of my past lives. That’s all I remember. Now, I get dreams where I remember my past lives in parallel universes on other Earths and crap and different timelines and different times. I’m stuck in this body permanently and am always schizophrenic since I come back alive and wake up after 2011 and 2011 was when I dropped out and got schizophrenia in college so I cannot undo the psychosis and the mental illness part. It’s like a living hell on Earth for eternity. I thought I was a random victim but I’m not. I think aliens control the Montauk Project at the highest level. I could go on about a thousand different things I know or think I know but I will not. I know a lot. A ton of ????. But it’s all paranoid conspiracy crap…"

175951497,"Any Beatles fan knows that _PERSON_ One wasn’t the sole reason the Beatles broke up. Things had been getting tense among them before _PERSON_ even came into the picture. The group was going through a long, slow “death” and when she came into the picture it was kind of like the straw that broke the camels back. The final demise was when they couldn’t agree on who to manage them to replace _NAME_. Anyways, I’m was watching clips of the Beatles making the “ Let it Be” album. _NAME_ had _PERSON_ sitting in on all the sessions. Not just hanging around in the control booth or hanging around on the outskirts, she was sitting right among them as they played. And I knew that the other three Beatles didn’t like her and resented her being there. They had been together almost ten years and their rule from the very beginning had been “NO wives or girlfriends in the studio while they worked. But it just hit me of the scope of _PERSON_ being there. Years later _NAME_ would say they allowed her t
here because _NAME_ loved her and _NAME_ and _PERSON_ never like to be separated (even when they went to the bathroom). But watching these clips I just realized how awkward and uncomfortable it must have been. All three Beatles forced themselves to be nice to her and accept her. But here’s the greatest band on earth, who have been together ten years, who went through all the craziness of Beatlemania, having most of the world love them and being successful beyond anyone’s imagination, and here was _PERSON_. This presence suddenly thrust on them. They were on their best behavior but some of the dislike and hostility must have come out sometimes. I mean they are all literally within 10 feet from each other and there was most likely enormous pressure to keep up their quality of work and make good music and top themselves and here’s this newcomer who infiltrates their inner circle of being the most successful band.

And said that if I’m still not responding well to risperidone I could maybe give clozapine a try. But the bad thing about is, that I would have to stay for several weeks into hospital, and that I’ve to do blood work once a week for 18 weeks and if everything is alright then blood work once a month. I disagreed because of the hospital stay. And I don’t know how much of change it would bring. Because on the four other meds I was more psychotic than on risperidone. But since risperidone I’m unable to focus, am tired all day and still get these violent delusions and hearing voices also vision and illusions. Anybody changed from risperidone to clozapine ?"

It hurt so bad, I would cut to distract. There are a lot of reasons to cut. But after awhile it didn’t work anymore. It has been very hard for me to use coping skills, but much better than going down the spiral of self harm. Some people use rubber bands to snap themselves or hold ice to change the bad thoughts. I just think it’s a process where I had to be willing to try something I didn’t think would work. Or just trying a lot of things until something worked. Not saying I never feel like hurting myself.

175951658,Me too. They sit to long in the cup and the tea becomes bitter. I became an old bag myself. No point crying over spilled years with sz. Just makes me cry.
175951659,It sounds like she’s very distressed but that’s no way to get what you want… by screaming… i don’t know what to suggest to you… i hope this all gets resolved soon …
175951660,Well that’s just stupid. And it’s an awfully hard law to enforce.

He is in bad shape and might not make it through the night. Just because I'm not close to them and don't really care for him, doesn't mean I want them to die! It's been an upsetting day. Plus if they are both in the hospital that means my Aunt is watching her 7-ish year old son and who knows if he has Covid and he could give it to my Aunt and Uncle (Uncle is high risk). Plus there are other adult children that live with them. It's sort of a his/hers situation so I never know which kids are living there at any given moment. So they could have it. What a nightmare."

175951674,I feel like I need to be in the hospital but I can’t because that would mean I’ll need to abandon my studies completely. Nothing can get better for me anymore and I am losing hope.

175951683,This happened to me a lot in the years following my psychotic break. I would be thinking about something and then it would disappear. Sometimes I could even feel it pulling away and I would panic and try to stop it. But then it was gone and I had no memory of what I was thinking about. It was really scary.

If so that one keeps me up because it ups my thyroid and the thyroid controls the entire body I’ve missed a day of that one before (been on it since age 16 I’m almost 28) so I know I can miss that one… Amitriptyline is pretty much the one that makes me tired… I’m mostly worried about the amitriptyline (chronic pain med) and 2 mg haloperidol

174340304,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Relation between retinal vascular abnormalities and working memory impairment in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, DM _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, A _NAME_, CV _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Asian journal of psychiatry, Feb 2020 10 Emerging evidence indicates abnormal retinal micro-vasculature in schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) and its relation to cognitive functions. However, the association of these abnormalities with the cognitive deficits in these disorders has not been examined till date. Hence, we explored this aspect in patients with SCZ, BD, and healthy volunteers (HV). We examined 34 with SCZ, 39 with BD, and 45 HV. Retinal images were acquired using nonmydriatic fundus camera. The retinal images were analyzed, and average diameters of retinal arterioles and venules were calculated. Working memory was assessed using computerized one-back test from Cogstate® battery. There was 
significant difference between groups in retinal venules and arterioles caliber (p < 0.001). Both SCZ and BD patients had wider venules and narrower arterioles. They had significantly lower working memory accuracy (p = 0.008) and higher log mean speed (p < 0.001). There was significant positive correlation between one-back test accuracy and retinal arteriolar caliber (r = 0.22; p = 0.01) and between log mean speed score and retinal venular caliber (r = 0.20; p = 0.02). Findings suggest association between working memory and retinal vascular caliber, a potential pointer towards understanding the vascular pathology in cognitive deficits in SCZ and BD. Future studies need to examine whether retinal vascular could be a biomarker for SCZ and BD."

175951716,"Yes, but it seems Intracellular was able to show that the problem was just at a few sites and if you took those sites out it met the criteria; additionally, if you averaged the several studies they did together, it met the criteria even including the problematic sites.

It can be so hard to distinguish all these different things going on. Just stay strong."

175951746,"I think a lot of it is because of the combination of the benzos and the pain medication. You can stop breathing in your sleep and the pain doctor doesn't want to be responsible. When I was on pain medication I was told not to take the benzos after six pm. And he didn't really want me to take the pain meds at night either. The stopping of the breathing was the reason. In my opinion medical marijuana is safer than both pain meds and benzos. Just because they are prescript ion drugs doesn't make them safe. It is all in how you handle your medication. I have a medical marijuana card but it is legal in my state for recreational. I hope it works out. I would try to get that note. It would be worth it. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175951756,"Copy Pasted from _AT_MENTION_ a couple of months back. Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it 
doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like you’re just daydreaming to observers."
175951757,"Do you generally feel like it gets better when you force yourself over the block point? I have a lot of blockages, too, both in my creative work but also even with stuff like playing games or with watching / binging series etc. Not to speak of going out there _AT_MENTION_@. But often there is a certain time that I need to get over and then the blocked feeling goes away. It also seems a bit like something that is learned, like a muscle... but it also seems to get mor ehard when there is more [unconscious] stress. That seems liek the typical schizoid thing to do, to classify it under nature and feel powerless t change it, offloading responsibility to the universe . It might have to do something with tolerance for the lack of power you have in the real world - including TV series etc. Fantasizing is normalyl free of anxieties etc. because you are god. Everything else is always a bit of a hassle because even if you are unaware of most of it due to some disorder, most of the stuff, including body functi
ons etc, is beyond control. Well because one has no ingrained coding of positive expectation. If you experienced the world as being welcoming, warm, etc, then that will make it way easier to go into the world and expect it to be this way. If you experienced it as cold, indifferent etc. then not only will you have less wish to go out there, but you will probabyl also have controlled certain affects that tortured you, so that you yourself also have become cold and indifferent to a degree, complicating the whole thing."

174340313,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Neurological soft signs (NSS) and brain morphology in patients with chronic schizophrenia and healthy controls. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PloS one, 2020 Subtle abnormalities in sensory integration, motor coordination and sequencing of complex motor acts or neurological soft signs (NSS) are characteristic phenomena in patients with schizophrenia at any stage of the illness. Previous MRI studies in schizophrenia found NSS to be associated with cortical, thalamic and cerebellar changes. Since these studies mainly focused on first-episode or recent onset schizophrenia, the cerebral correlates of NSS in chronic schizophrenia remained rather unclear. 49 middle-aged patients with chronic schizophrenia with a mean duration of illness of 20.3 ± 14.0 years and 29 healthy subjects matched for age and sex were included. NSS were examined on the Heidelberg Scale and correlated to grey matter (GM) by using whole brain high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (3 Tesla) with SPM12/CAT12 
analyses. As expected, NSS in patients were significantly (p?0.001) elevated in contrast to healthy controls, a finding, which not only applied to NSS total score, but also to the respective subscales ""motor coordination"", ""sensory integration"", ""complex motor tasks"", ""right/left and spatial orientation"" and ""hard signs"". Within the patient group NSS total scores were significantly correlated to reduced GM in right lingual gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left thalamus (medial dorsal nucleus) and left posterior lobe of the cerebellum (declive). Respective negative associations could also be revealed for the subscales ""motor coordination"", ""complex motor tasks"" and ""right/left and spatial orientation"". These findings remained significant after FWE-correction for multiple comparisons and were confirmed when years of education, chlorpromazine-equivalents or variables indicating the severity of psychopathology were introduced as additional covariates. According to o
ur results lingual, parahippocampal, superior temporal, inferior and middle frontal gyri, thalamus and cerebellum have to be considered as important sites of NSS in chronic schizophrenia. That these findings only applied for patients but not healthy controls may indicate a different pathogenesis of NSS."

So I am doing better now although I have some psychosis still and its continuing even after the Aristada I got yesterday. I dont understand this. Why am I suddenly becoming so “psychotic” all the time. Insomnia/Mania/Mood/Vision/Etc…I also just exposed something I dont think I actually did though.

175951795,"It's good that you are seeking out information. Some years ago, through a series of mistakes, some mine some my psychiatrist's, I went off three medicines all at once (an anti-depressant, Sinaquan, and Lithium stabilizer and Ativan anti-anxiety), which treated my bipolar. The first day afterwards, no side effects, no depression, perfect world. The next day, after all the medicines had gone out of my system, panic attack, for which I gobbled down all of the medicine trying to stop that. First, just the right amount of medicine, second, too little medicine, third, too much medicine too fast (which had very difficult results). One thing is, you went on the medicine you were taking for some reason (depression), what if you go off of it OK but you get depressed again because you're not on an anti-depressant? Which psychiatrist are you going to go to for your next anti-depressant? The same psychiatrist you had. So, why are you leaving him or her out of the process now? If you keep your psychiatrist and n
othing goes wrong, you'll still have your psychiatrist. If you keep your psychiatrist and something does go wrong, you'll still have your psychiatrist you can call on. By keeping your psychiatrist, and keeping them in touch with what's going on, you can't lose. Verywellmind.com says, ""To help make it easier to come off Cymbalta, your doctor will likely recommend a taper lasting at least two weeks."" Since the weekend is approaching, I would consider calling your psychiatrist's secretary, and telling her what is going on. And ask that he or she call you back with what they think of this situation. One way of tapering off of medicine, I've heard from a psychiatrist, is to take it every other day. If you've been off the medicine 48 or more hours, you might want to consider taking the medicine, which will be a form of tapering and a preventive from going off the medicine too fast, until you can talk with your doctor. You can also call your pharmacist, or any pharmacist, about this, and call or go to the ER about 
such matters.Post Edited (_NAME_) : 2/25/2021 1:20:50 PM (GMT-7)"

My anxiety however has been through the roof. Even though my eyes feel and look fine, I am worried about going blind. Its like my mind is racing to the worst case scenario. Very odd.

174340353,"I had a paranoid schizophrenic father, sister and grandmother. What I learned growing up in a schizophrenia dominated home was that you never validate the delusions but you never challenge them either. I learned as a young child to accept anything my father said as his reality but try not to make it my own reality. As a child, that's a tall order since adults define reality for children all the time. For many schizophrenics the delusions are not intermittent. Meaning they have a constant stream of them and they cluster around a theme. For example, my father had religious delusions. All his delusions were related to one particular religion and the details of its theology. Even if a schizophrenic isn't verbalizing his delusions doesn't mean they aren't alive and well in his head waiting for an external stimulus to make them visable. Don't be surprised if the delusions seem to pop up randomly. They aren't random. He's just being stimulated by something in his environment and he's speaking what's going 
on in his head. The same is true for hallucinations. Many schizophrenics have a running dialogue of voices they hear constantly. The voices aren't always command hallucinations, ie. ordering him to do something. Sometimes the voices are running commentary of his own actions or conversations with other people in the room. Hallucinations are heard as if you were speaking to me. They are not internal, like thinking thoughts. It is very much an external auditory experience. Command hallucinations are more of a problem. At their worst they can propel the person to harm others. In a mild form they can command the individual to engage in odd behaviors that appear to make no sense. Not every schizophrenic has command hallucinations but they are common."

174340347,that’s what I was doing…and I’m realizing maybe the effects weren’t from the anti-psychotics but from the schizophrenia too because schizophrenia causes that.

I took risperdal when I was symptomatic at first and it wasnt enough or the medication. Everyone’s different. I think I was on 15mgs of Risperdal and it still didn’t work. I have been on almost all the atypicals and none of them worked very well. Geodon made me worse too. Everyone’s different.

175951890,"Yeah. That’s what I’m going to do _AT_MENTION_ . My pdoc says some APs do make people gain weight, and she doesn’t expect me to stay on a med that does that."

Its embarrassing with my sisters and their husbands. I dont want to go back to some lousy job after disability ends. I’ve given up on having a decent life and having a relationship with someone. It’s not from illness, it’s from medication. I am new to being on antipsychotics permanently and maybe I’m being a baby, but it has drastically altered how I can cope with life."

Now that I think of it I don’t wanna. Maybe I’ll run into him tho

175951909,"I was always the quiet kid. I never said a thing unless someone asked me a question. People thought I was being polite and a good listener. So they smothered me with compliments. I just didn’t enjoy people’s company tbh. I’ve always enjoyed my own company. As I got older I started to feel pressured to talk to people and I didn’t really like it. Now I speak more because I’ve found my own voice and I learned to acclimate. But, I still enjoy being alone from time to time. I read my books, study and just entertain myself."

175951911,A lot. I was in the military for more than 20 years. We moved often. It was nice though because they moved you usually. I moved myself a couple of times and pocketed the extra money when we were young and didn’t have much stuff. I have moved twice in the last few years and I hired Two Men and a Truck. I have too much stuff now to move everything by myself. But we bought this house we are in now. It’s the last time we are moving until I need to go to assisted living or a nursing home.

I got plenty of boiled sweets in a bowl here - and yes it does help with the cravings for a beer. Tho im also getting thru 2 bags of sugar a week tho lol. _PERSON_ asked about going on Ant-Abuse , but they are never keen. Same with the benzos, i have to be near dying before they prescribe them. They put alot of the focus on “you” to quit - like going to AA meetings (which i do) - but that just translates to me that they cannot be bothered with the drug side of things."

174340357,Haven’t totally quit down to five cigarettes a day plan on totally cutting it out and vaping.Had a bit of mania yesterday which went away when I vaped. Plan on cutting all nicotine out and then vaping nicotine free juice. With the Omega 3 I can definitely quit because the cravings aren’t there I’m just smoking as a habit now in the mornings and evenings my concentration is greatly increased and I’m not thinking of cigarettes all the time. Id recommend Omega 3 for any smoker or schizophrenic the difference for me was immediate the next day.
175951923,Thank you lots!
175951924,"Oh yeah I’ve been gaining weight for almost 3 decades now. Dieting attempts, and exercise when my body could take it would briefly reverse or slow it down but it would always come back strong as ever. When I look in the mirror I see a deformed freak. The sad truth is that the voices are terrible without the meds. I absolutely can’t handle them that way. So I keep taking them. I have had the voices talk some about the weight but it’s been worse in reality when it came to real people. Now I have diabetes to add to the sickness of it all and I can sense that I will die of an obesity related disorder sooner rather than later."

174340368,I switched from risperdone to geodon. I took geodon for 2 years but ended up switching again to abilify I had the sleep issues as well on geodon. That is why I’m now on abilify.
175951937,You are welcome.
175951938,I relate to this _AT_MENTION_ like I don't have motivation to do anything but also just being at home makes me restless. I went for an hour long walk the other day and that kind of helped although I about gave myself an asthma attack! I can only sleep so much. I'm concerned how my mental health will be once I have four days off in a week. I've worked 40 + hours since I was 20 years old. I won't know what to do with myself only working 24. It IS awful. You are right about that _AT_MENTION_. I feel bad complaining because there are lots of people really sick with Corona virus but being inside and just stuck is also really really hard. HUGS Kit
174340363,"Aps reduce dopamine. Low dopamine is linked to low motivation, interest etc. This is why reduced feeling, laziness etc. When take aps dopamine receptor density also increases as dopamine level is low. If reduce the ap dose a bit due to increased dopamine receptor density you might get anxious, paranoid etc but improves negative symptoms a bit too. So if negative symptoms is bothering you much then a suitable strategy is to ask pdoc to reduce ap dose a bit and at that same time start cbt and other therapies to better manage the withdrawal effects associated with lower dose. Anyway do it under the supervision of your pdoc only as you might not able to manage the withdrawal effects if not got enough therapy sessions."
174340358,"A lot of my hallucinations were much fewer in total or less intense when they did happen, once I got on medication. But I really haven't seen any improvement with things that others call delusional thinking, so I don't think one can always just rely on medications like they're going to solve everything. Life can be really rough even with medications, and medications come with a whole string of other problems like side effects, being really drowsy, or weight gain. I think one of the best things you can do to support someone who has delusions is to just listen and not argue with the person. Then, even if you don't necessarily want to agree, it feels less threatening and it feels like you care. If someone says something that validates the way I feel, as in, ""that must be very scary,"" etc., it helps me feel calmer instead of crazy and escalating."

175951941,I’ve lost 10lbs in a week before but I was doing an intense daily cardiovascular regimen to accomplish that. This new year I was able to do 5lbs a week though I wasn’t able to continue after 2 weeks. 2.5lbs a week is the recommended amount of weight to lose.

175951954,I took that i had bad heart problems.
175951955,That’s too bad. It really helps me but my hallucinations are controlled with the Geodon so I can’t speak for the effectiveness of Latuda as an AP. Geodon does come with heart concerns. I have had both psychiatrists and one nurse practitioner who were really concerned about me being on it. That nurse practitioner she told me it’s not a med intended for you to be on long term. I have been on it for 10 years now. I had one heart scare but it ended up being nothing.
175951956,Im sorry you too are dealing with this. Hope you can overcome it. And ideas on how to do that?
174340374,"I found this in my rss feeds. AbstractSchizophrenia is associated with a range of negative personal, economic andso-cial consequences. Long duration of untreated psychosis can lead tounfavorable chronic illness courses and long-term low functioning. Hence, there is high inter-est in detecting vulnerable individualsearly in the prodromal phase before psy-chotic decompensation tointroduce earlyinterventions.There are various clini-cal, (neuro-)physiological, or cognitive markers and risk factors discussed as be-ing suitable for early detection of schizophrenia. The present dissertation inves-tigatedseveral of these risk indicators concerning their presence in vulnerable at-risk individuals and patients with manifest psychosisto gain further insights about their qualification for at-risk assessments. The three clinical samples (at-risk subjects, early, and chronic schizophrenia patients) werecompared to a healthy control group.Study (1)examinedthe event-related brain potential of the mismatch negativi

These two indices wereexpected to differentiate between healthy individuals and the clinical samples and as markers for illness progression they werehypothesized being further reducedin manifest psychotic patients compared to at-risk indi-viduals.

175952030,"Hey everyone hope you’re well. I recently got back in lexapro, 10mg, about to go up to 20 per the plan my psychiatrist outlined. Has anyone had any issues with exercise while on it? Is it safe? Does it feel like you can’t get your heart rate up? So many questions. I know I got a bit lazy the first time I was on this for 2.5 years and I don’t want that to happen this time so I plan to do some moderate exercise, nothing too intense, just stay a little active. I have GAD, health anxiety mainly heart stuff and obsessive thoughts. So the reason I’m so concerned is of course running and exercise gets the heart rate going and winded lol that kind of stuff triggers me and I freak out thinking the worst of course. Yesterday I went for a jog, felt winded pretty quickly, heart palpitations or what it seemed like, etc. so not sure if it’s cause the lexapro, an actual heart issue, or just simply out of shape. Hoping just the last one. I went to TWO cardiologists when I was 30, four or so years ago, an
d both did extensive tests, both said my heart is fine. Of course my brain says well it’s been a few years that can change. And maybe my heart is fine but not supposed to be exercising or overexerting while on lexapro. I’m sure that’s not the case, I’d imagine we have to stay active regardless, but.. I’m going to check with my psychiatrist of course but I’m waiting a bit since I bother him all the time lol. Any thoughts or insight would be helpful.

Enjoy your days and when things get bad examine yourself so you are prepared in all good works. Enjoy your new job. Don’t get overwhelmed, every job I started I couldn’t sleep for months just adapting to a world where I knew nothing and I wanted to know everything. It takes time to create patterns in the brain to make routines. When the mind lacks control the brain adapts by symbolically creating control in dreams. So dream big. Good things."

If there was a way to prevent them, that means you can stop them from happening in the future. But the truth is, some things are out of our hands. People die, horrifically, for no reason.

So staying ahead of things is helpful. I have a phone appointment with my psych NP tomorrow.

I have profound problems with religion. I do not take the sacraments (Eucharist, penance) since about two months, it is not good. I often spent much more than three hours daily in the Internet, during the time when I surfed in Internet as much I had significantly less obsessions and compulsions associated with taking oaths to Allah. I read about non-catholic monotheistic religions since about 2011 (I do not remember when it started). I met opinions that: Mosaic Law is still valid and we have to circumcise boys and men, keep Sabbath, Passover, some people who believed in these doctrines accepted Jesus as Messiah, 
some did not accept Him, popes since some decades (or even more than eight centuries!) are heretics and “mainstream” Catholicism is heretical and lead to eternal torment (opinions of rigorous sedevacantists), Quran is true Word of One and Only God and if a person rejects it he/she will burn and be tormented in Hell, Gehenna, rather for eternity, I read quite much about numerical and scientific miracles of the Quran, most credible Muslims for me are quranists, not sunnis or shias, that Bible (Old and New Testaments) is true, but there is no _NAME_ (for example, Holy Spirit is not God), that sex constitues marriage and if a woman who is a virgin is raped, she becomes the wife of the rapist and if she has sexual intercourse with someone other than the rapist when the rapist is alive, she commits adultery (this belief looks unjust to my mentality, but I agree that there should be no extramarital sex at all)."

For three months I made like 10 grand a month and I didn’t get my disability stopped. They were trial work months. I wish I hadn’t have wasted 6 months working as an aircraft mechanic. I would have worked that other job longer.

175952160,Sometimes a relatively trivial transgression gets exaggerated in our minds and we punish ourselves as if it were something much worse. Be kind to yourself and don’t be an aggressive prosecutor to yourself. I’m sure you have a defense even if you can’t think of it now.
175952161,I don’t see anything weird or abnormal either. But I see people that other people say they don’t see. But there’s nothing unusual about the people I see and talk to
174340418,"You need to stop using Schizophrenia as an excuse for murderers doing what they have done. You’re raising _USER_ID_ and making people like me out to be dangerous psychos. Being Schizophrenic is not a prerequisite to stabbing someone multiple times. 1% of the population have this illness, and believe me, there would be a big problem if that many people behaved like this because of the illness. It has to stop. You’re not helping the situation of many thousands of people who are suffering because of this. I cannot even tell anyone I am a schizophrenic because of this kind of media representation. Why don’t you write stories about Schizophrenia where people are not doing something wrong for a change? We’re all trying hard to live our lives peacefully as we can, and just _NAME_ picking the worst examples of us is wholly mis-representing an entire population of people."

All evidence is destroyed. I remember doing it before however I have no evidence to back it up. That’s why I haven’t mentioned the previous times before now. You’re absolutely right- I would have done it before (and did).

174340416,"Problem with CBD treating schizophrenia is that the CBD products we have are pricey and in order to use CBD you need a much higher amount. I bought a bottle of CBD gummies and each gummie is only 25mg oc CBD in a bottle of 20 gummies. In order for it to ""treat"" schizophrenia you need probably as much as 1000mgs of CBD a day. So that's like 2 bottlees of 40 dollar gummies each day."
175952196,"Pretty sure if there’s an afterlife, schizophrenics would be welcomed and cured immediately, then treated like heroes.

My nipples are still funky, and my appetite is still absolutely voracious. I feel so out of control. I literally get hungry every hour and it is torture not to eat. I can have a huge meal that normally would have satiated me for hours and I am hungry again just 1 hour later. I have gained a horrible amount of weight. My overactive bladder which I thought had become much better is now suddenly terrible again as well, I have to pee usually like twice an hour, a lot of times back to back. It is horribly annoying. I watched the second It movie with my boyfriend in theaters and had to leave for the bathroom 5 TIMES before it was over and then had to go AGAIN after that. Insane!!

175952225,"There are a lot of things that have helped me. Most recently, getting some much needed hearing aids let me figure out that some of the whispery hallucinations that I thought I was having were actually background noise that I just couldn’t really hear. I still get some whispers, but not nearly as many as I thought. Eating whole food and not processed junk and sugar has also made a massive impact on my mental health. My meds and just life in general used to make me exhausted all the time and I still had severe chronic insomnia, but eating only whole foods really really helped with anxiety, irritability, energy, and sleep quality. CBD oil (from a legitimate lab tested source, not a gas station) also helped a ton with sleep and anxiety. And anxiety is tied into so many things for me, so it really helps to just use a bit when I’m stressed or the paranoia is getting to me."
175952226,I am also new to this and I honestly go through the same thing as well. Some days I feel good and happy about myself then the next days it goes down hill. I started to journal in my thoughts. It got hard for me to express my feelings to other people because I felt like no one could relate. So I started to journal out my thoughts I have. I notice when I rant it out on my journal I feel less anxious and no pressure to forget anything. I started going to therapy actually as well too!

I am in a very dark place because of my disabilities and I keep getting feedback from other people saying that I’m worthless (not a delusion- just random fights between my family here and there). It’s not really helpful when my family is saying the weird stuff around me when I’m trying to grow. About mistakes: I was beaten when I got questions wrong on a test so I’ve grown thinking that mistakes are supposed to be punished for. I know that mistakes are okay, but I’ve been told that mistakes are bad and no one should make mistakes. As a result, I beat myself over any mistakes I make. I hope you guys understand. I’m really sorry."
175952240,"In the past I have been very self-destructive, and it would very much seem that way looking in. I had a failed OD in March this year, and narrowly avoided being sent to the mental hospital.

175952242,"I wouldn’t call hallucinations changing their mind about your delusions an antipsychotic effect. It may have been due to your expectations and feelings following the med change. The effect antipsychotics have on delusions is usually more that you don’t get many new ones and that the old ones become less important to you over time. Of course, I’m sure there are many exceptions, and they sometimes work very quickly as well."

175952245,When you come off meds there’s a honeymoon period for about a month or so. Then after that without meds you’ll get worse inch by inch until you lose insight at which point you’re a danger to yourself and others. Don’t come off your meds. Switch to other meds if necessary instead.
174340435,I'm doing okay. I had an appointment with my T on Saturday. We talked about my hallucinations. She's concerned about some of them because they upset me and she doesn't like me to be upset.

174340438,Well you don’t have to have delusions to have sz. And I don’t think I have any delusions as a result of D2 receptor activity. You obviously don’t believe in spirits and think that’s totally delusional but there’s a ton of mentally well people who believe in spirits. I’m not exactly fully mentally well per se but I’m close and if you spent time with me and didn’t know I might have sz then you just wouldn’t know. There’s nothing about how I act that’s out of the ordinary. I’m just a normal person outside of hearing voices. I’m not afraid to say it’s sz but I’m just saying there’s a chance it’s just auditory pareidolia because I’m in much better shape than most with sz. Something just doesn’t fit about my illness compared to the rest of you. Maybe I’m just on the end of the spectrum.
175952248,I believe happy people have no anger issues. Hopefully Vraylar will make me happy.
174340440,Where did you buy it? Do you have studies showing its good for negative and cognitive symptoms? I put a Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation electrodes device on my brain frontal lobes but it made me have visual hallucinations like flashing white lights. It says do not use on the brain but I did. Is that bad? Does it cause brain damage?
174340437,"One of my professors once said all cases of schizophrenia are caused by teratogens during pregnancy, which cause epigenetic changes, eventually leading to psychosis in adolescence or adulthood.

174340442,"It has a side effect list worse than an antipsychotic. I was on it for about a month for something unrelated. I couldn’t tolerate it long term. It’s not something you should go on long term either. Side Effects Nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , lightheadedness , dizziness , or a feeling of spinning may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. ADVERTISEMENT Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: painful/difficult swallowing, hearing changes (such as ringing in the ears , decreased hearing), joint stiffness /pain/swelling, signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine, pink urine), signs of liver problems (such as loss of appetite, stomach / abdominal pain , yellowing eyes / skin 
, dark urine ), yellow-gray-brown tooth discoloration , blue-gray skin/ tongue /lips/gums). Minocycline may rarely cause a serious increase in pressure inside the skull (intracranial hypertension -IH). The risk of this side effect is greater for women of childbearing age who are overweight or who have had IH in the past. If IH develops, it usually goes away after minocycline is stopped; however, there is a chance of permanent vision loss or blindness. Get medical help right away if you have: severe/lasting headache , vision changes (such as blurred/ double vision , decreased vision , sudden blindness), nausea/vomiting that doesn’t stop. This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition ( Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea ) due to a type of resistant bacteria. This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has stopped. Tell your doctor right away if you develop: diarrhea that doesn’t stop, abdominal or stomach pain /cramping, blood / mucus in your stool. 
Do not use anti-diarrhea or opioid medications if you have any of these symptoms because these products may make them worse. Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in oral thrush or a new yeast infection . Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth , a change in vaginal discharge , or other new symptoms. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: fever that doesn’t go away, new or worsening lymph node swelling , rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing . This is not a complete list of possible side effects . If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist."

But I could die any time from an aneurysm or whatever, so I try to live for today. Hopefully my friend and I will get to the vape store this week and I can buy a bunch of kratom and CBD. I still haven't tried a dose of 50mg, it probably helps a lot more than the 10mg doses I've got. I need to find if they'll help calm akathisia because I've been getting it bad lately. I'll get two different kinds of kratom. The kpins used to be magic for akathisia. Ativan doesn't help it much unless I take two and then all I can really do is sleep.

I’m not saying that choice gave me schizophrenia but it didn’t make my life better. I should have moved out of the city, it was too stimulating for me with all the people and noises. I live in the city now though and I don’t have that anxiety anymore, so it’s kind of fine now. But I’m still considering moving out of the city in the future."

174340457,I am not concerned for myself so much and would even prefer to be “out of the sz closet” but I don’t know how my other family members who have jobs would feel about it. A somewhat bad thing happened to me and my then fiancee about twelve years ago. My fiancee was featured in a front page article about a art therapy program in town and the newspaper made the mistake of publishing her full name and those of the other participants. My landlady said she saw the article and said she wanted us to move out and that she talked to a priest who was a mutual acquaintance of her and my wife and said she “knew all about her”. Her real motivation was probably that she didn’t like that we kept the thermostat too high (even though we paid for our own gas). She was afraid we would harm the furnace but we needed it hot because my fiancee has a very bad thyroid. We moved out and we let it go but we probably could have filed a discrimination lawsuit but we had no desire to leave a bigoted old widow penniles
s. A big question for me now is to whether to use my illness to promote my work. I have a local newspaper interested in featuring my apps and my story in their magazine. I am afraid that social security will start to pick on me even though I am trying to do something useful even though I don’t make much money on them (not even 1% of SGA). It is a chance I feel I want to take because I am somewhat happy with what I created and I even have hopes of hiring disabled people someday to contribute art and other ideas to my projects.

I didn’t develop symptoms until age 30 though. I’m getting a therapist. I’m in the process of kinda interviewing the ones that take medicare/medi-cal.

There were less activities and more sitting around watching TV. The overall situation was similar. Two people per room, shared bathrooms, all that.

175952423,"I have the occasional issue- blinking, mouth movements, and ALWAYS movements in my left hand. But mostly, my issues are brought on by strong emotions or caffeine. I really have to watch my caffeine intake. Even a small amount sets me off. You can stop your movement for a little while with TD, but I have found that the only way I can stop my blinking is by closing my eyes. I have a theory that this is because one has to naturally blink. Consequently, each time I blink, it sets off the TD again. Just a theory, though. I’ve also noticed that my mouth movements are worse when my blinking is bad and also when I mess with my face. It’s kinda weird. And last but not least, those spoons and forks that are supposed to help and cost a couple of hundred dollars didn’t do a thing for me. So no soup!"

In order to test the theory I would love to come off abilify maintena monthly injection but im not sure how to do so safely. Can I just stop taking it and it will taper off in my system? Do I have to start taking the tablets and manually taper off those. Does anybody know?
175952491,That’s certainly understandable. My opinion comes from my religious upbringing though where fasting in moderation is practiced.

I don’t think anyone with an eating disorder should fast ever. _AT_MENTION_. What kind of things do you eat cause you’re the perfect size and your skin is just gorgeous?

Now she has to take care of her own kids and she’s having a bad reaction. I suspect she’s trying to manipulate me into coming over there to help.

174340482,"There isn’t many supplements for positive symptoms, like _AT_MENTION_ said there is Amyloban. I tried Lion’s Mane, its like Amyloban but maybe weaker, it did nothing for my negative symptoms. I don’t have positive symptoms on meds except for rarely hearing my home doorbell ring or my mother calling my name when no one is there."
174340484,"Well it’s certainly not high copper levels in blood that causes it. Nor does B6 Niacin, Folate, Liposomed Vitamin C, magnesium etc cure it. Orthomolecular phyciatry is bogus. I tried it for 6months, lucky I’m alive really. Don’t do it"

175952522,"Morning I actually think I’m gonna put my book out by myself. This one anyway, since it’s already been a year. The next one idk I’ll see. I see a lot of info about self publishing vs traditional. So idk. Anyway just putting the finishing touches on my book."
175952523,I have some but I usually don’t need it. I am stock piling it because I only get 4 a month for when I get older. I only need half of one though if I need one. I get the four a month for free. It’s Geodon for me but I was on it about 8 years before it became a problem.
174340478,The thing is that I need at least 3 big cups to slightly improve my negative symptoms and be able to talk more to my friends and play more video games. Its good and bad at the same time. Maybe I should just have those 3 big cups occasionally and not everyday.
174340483,"I’ve fully accepted my diagnosis of schizophrenia for very few, very short periods (15 minutes-2 hours?) over the last 10 years."
175952524,Also I can’t do paperwork if I go out of my parents’s house. I can’t live independently and take care of a house. At the same time I am not mentally disabled enough to be accepted at an asylum so most likely I will end up in the streets. I have a physio university degree with high GPA and I will end up in the streets. Intelligence is clearly not important.
175952525,"I’m so sorry, _AT_MENTION_"
175952526,Whose idea was that; I tried to tell them it was racist
175952527,"I agree, it was probably someone else that you believe was him."
175952528,1. I also thought security cameras were watching me and targeting me 2. I thought I was a buddha or buddha like supreme figure 3. I strongly believed in numerology and took numbers very seriously and to the extreme 4. I gave meaning to super trivial events 5. Also had illuminati delusions that I was in the illuminati and a powerful person 6. Mostly i felt very spiritual but it was out of control I had two psychotic episodes and these are some recurring themes
175952529,"yeah, i kind of know how you feel, you probably had a good routine going with going to work and that can be a big change esp if it helped you feel good, I didn’t have a job but i volunteered at my clubhouse and i took my mum out so it was like a job and it helped, now its like blah but i guess we got to try and make the best of this situation somehow."
175952530,HI I’m talking about when you wave a hand and see 15 hands go past? only had it one other time is it a health issue? what is it called other than ‘on drugs’ totally no drugs involved i mean!
175952531,Oh man. I hope they pick you up
175952532,"Idk yet, its not out but good idea, I will ask my pdr about samples when its out."

174340480,"Interpretation: Despite the established efficacy of antipsychotics in preventing relapse, these data indicate that these drugs might not prevent subsequent exacerbations for a proportion of individuals whose illness is stabilised on continuous antipsychotic treatment. Tardive dyskinesia in particular might have pathophysiological implications for relapse ."

175952534,"sorry to hear you experience hatred cause you are chinese… i really like you and i’m sure a lot of people here do. I think it’s weird to hate the chinese for the virus cause it’s just a virus… you can’t control nature, it doesn’t have anything to do with what race you are."
175952535,"I don’t have the kind of money to be donating to charities. Let the billionaires do it, my contribution would be pennies compared to their twenty dollar bills. I do give a few bills and maybe a cigarette to homeless people who ask though. In VA. In CA I can’t afford to do this because there are so many of them."

174340488,I don’t have any of the symptoms they found in those mice.
175952539,I have tried Geodon but it made me dizzy. Quitted fast
175952540,Thank you for your reply scaredy cat. What my current therapist and I came up with is that I have to make an appointment to see the psych whether or not I'm comfortable with taking the meds that he'll prescribe me. Once I have a script written out the next part will be for me and my therapist to work on actually getting me to take the pills. I also agree with how mental health is so stigmatized. I believe that to be the reason as to why I am having such a hard time taking something. All I hear and see are people saying bad things regarding medication.
175952541,"That’s great rogueone. You are an inspiration to me. It is because of your positive attitude, and you volunteer, have friends and family."
175952542,"I know you are in terrible pain. I'm so sorry for that. It's only been a year, that's such a short time, so of course the pain is still fresh. And your son sounds like he was a wonderful young man. You can put up a front to other people, maybe that helps you function. But there has to be someone to confide your real feelings to. When my husband died suddenly, the grief shook me to my core. I was on strong anti anxiety medicine for 2 years. And I had a few close friends that I talked to about it. You need some kind of support, no matter how strong you are. If you don't want to talk to friends, choose a therapist. But don't go thru this alone. My heart goes out to you. _NAME_."
175952543,"So guess what!!! Today the chiefs in charge said I can write a monthly mental health piece for the company newsletter! So in a way a bit, I'm getting paid to write too. This is awesome. I get to choose the topic. The training lady said she preferred a certain title for that section of the newsletter, which I didnt mind and it was actually a good title. So I went with it. Yes!!! Another thing to add to my list!"
175952544,best of luck to you! i hope you manage to get all the work done
175952545,To be honest I am danger towards my family and everybody else. It’s because I have a very serious harm OCD.I have never done anybody any thing. they realy scare me. And I don’t have them on meds. My abilities to concentrate and remember has suffered because of seroquel.
174340486,"Some people have just delusions or disorganized thoughts for positive symptoms and no hallucinations. Hallucinations aren’t necessary to have a diagnosis of a schizophrenia, as long as you have another positive symptom instead."
175952546,"Yeah damn right they do. I had “Schizophrenic reeks havoc in local community” from the local papers 5 years ago. Course they never mentioned the reason why i glassed the fella in the face, cos he was rinsing my money for months - and told the town i was a sex offender. Anything for a bloody story."
175952547,"I’d like nothing rather! But it’s not at its worst any more; I’ve come a long way. Around almost everyone, except for a few exceptional people who can get me going, through free association from what they are saying. -A."
175952548,For the first time since I got my fitbit it rated my sleep as good last night instead of fair like it normally does.
175952549,Yeah. You gain some and you lose some on meds. Mind you. I don’t mind paying the price of medication. I am much more relaxed. I have no more racing thoughts and get to sleep so much easier and I no longer overthink things and live in fear of everything… That is worth the price of admission.
175952550,Good good. Now you can get away from the leaky ceiling!
175952551,i used to sleep a lot when i was bored in the psych ward. At home i have my routine and i just sleep at night for 10 hours more or less.
175952552,You might try meditation. That could be a component in an array of methods used to blunt the effect of your psychosis. Try to remain as positive as you can. If you descend into a morass of negativity it could make your illness worse. Keep in touch with your therapists. Give them constant feedback. Let them know what you are going through.
175952553,"When I’m not on meds, the voices are nonstop, 24/7, and have gotten worse and worse so that they are never nice."
175952554,"I’m sorry man, in photos you didn’t look fat!"
175952555,I can’t prove you wrong but if you are dead I beg of you to spend your time as a weightless light orb exploring the beauty of the universe and not stuck here in the black and white of sz.com which anybody can do.
175952556,"You are absolutely welcome here, if you ask me. You are a nice poster, seem to fit in well, and have experienced the gamut of symptoms most of us have. I don’t get why your psych wouldn’t want you here, though."
174340494,I use to be schzioaffective now paranoid and borderline personality. I don’t hear voices per say but like a voice like it’s my thoughts telling me what people are saying about me if that makes sense
174340490,"I was masturbating 4-6 times a day while on Abilify. It felt like a compulsive repetetive job, not normal sex anymore. Sometimes I had testicular pain from too much masturbation. Now on Risperdal I do it 1-2 times a week and it feels better and normal."
175952557,"I wrote something just now. I call it, ""Talking to crazy before morning meds"". Keep telling me about these things All of these crazy things All I can do is listen against my will I put my pills in my hand Walk into the kitchen to get some water I take them and you question Why? Well, I want to be sedated Listening to you.. Why? Do you want a few? Don’t tell me that you’re scared I know what it’s like to be afraid By the way, I’ve heard it all before I don’t even want to live anymore Look out the window! The sun is rising We had a good talk Together in my mind Before my morning meds"

175952559,I’m having one of those days where I perceive everyone as a threat. I don’t think I need my dose of risperidone increasing because this only happens occasionally. I just need to get through the day. Does anyone else have days like this?
175952560,I even made a song with their names
175952561,My first encounter with the voice of _PERSON_ was in 1998 or 1999 too - somewhere there when I was in junior high school and 14/15 years old. I didn’t know what voices were and where they came from nor that their names were _PERSON_ and _NAME_. But the first thing I remember _PERSON_ saying to me was “you’ll get sick if you go down the stairs”. I was walking down the crowded corridors from one class to another and had to go down a flight of stairs to get to my next class. Hearing this voice threatening me gave me panic attacks.
175952562,20000 steps is 10 miles a day. That’s great. _PERSON_ used to walk 10 miles a day for his physical and mental health
175952563,No I get enough sleep.

175952574,I understand how hard that is. That’s why it is SO SIGNIFICANT that you do it! Way to go!
175952575,Maybe try a different dosage of your antipsychotic? Honestly klonopin is a really good med for me. But if it’s not agreeing with you then I would ask to try something else.

175952586,"That’s what life is. No. The older I get the more I don’t understand life. Even in science, what seem like concrete answers at one time tend to lead to more questions - new hypotheses and discoveries that lead to yet knew theories, hypotheses and discoveries. With luck, age can give you wisdom, but yet more questions. No. The value may be found somewhere else, or in the future. For instance, some theorems take hundreds of years to prove. Another example is applying one discipline to another, and physicists and engineers bring a lot of value to biology and medicine. See for instance the book “Scale.” That’s paradoxical, but I don’t see paradoxes as a problem. Life is all about them. I may exist in one sense, but not another. What’s wrong with that? Doesn’t mean I fail at life. I still eat and poop and all of that physical level stuff, but it seems that the only fundamental thing that can be proven is consciousness itself.

Requires good high school or some college mathematics and arithmetic. The hardest part if finding the right virus, which I found was (NOROVIRUS AKA WINTER STOMACH BUG). Basically, you can predict with some accuracy how many people have schizophrenia or bipolar based on it. It comes out spot on. I think I was given this information while sleeping like part of a disclosure thing or alien thing.

Non-Ordinary Experiences and Perceptions are a part of life and are enshrined in the Humanities (Art, Literature, Myth, Religion, and Philosophy). “The Heroic Quest” is a part of almost every single human culture on this planet, nearly universal and goes back in our species for at least 70,000 years according to the most recent archeological and anthropolotical records, probably further (look up the “lion man figurine” on google). Though there are people that definitely experience forms of dementia and other brain damage, poisoning, cognative impairment, or hormon
al issues. It is not until relatively that a sort of psychiatric blanketing of human psychic developments has been branded as mental illness. Though some religions have done the same thing in the past to the present with such things as inquisitions and witch burning. Non-Ordinary Perceptions and Experiences are just a part of what it means to be human and in the human condition. Deep meaning can be found in many of these experiences and issues surrounding them. Often we are not given the support or community to explore them."

We’re expected to get A grades in uni, graduate, then be piled in debt, and work for 8 dollars per hour for a stupid job we didn’t want. Houses are so expensive (they’re at 800,000 dollars right now for an apt) and there is no way that I can get a house when I get older, because they pay you so low. And you can’t get a pension after you retire without owning a house. I’m mentally ill and disabled, and there are no accomodations in school. You’re just expected to work your butt off but they don’t even look at you if you are from a less prestigious uni. Even if I become a therapist, they only pay you 2000 dollars per month. Grad school is 9,000 dollars per semester. I don’t have 
enough money. Is it even worth it to live??? In this ???? hole of a society that just sucks life outta ya until you are weak and old…like seriously. Sometimes I would rather die than live my entire life in poverty. And they expect you to have a child when you get married, but honestly how can I have a child when I’m broke as ????? They are like “oh lol the birthrate is so low, pls produce children thanks” but how can you even get married or have children when you’re broke as ??_USER_ID_ life doesn’t make sense, y’all.

Personally, I'm OK with it, in part, because I'm a nurse and have taken care of people like me. They're just sick. And boy do I get it now. Recently I had to deal with a person in my apartment building who was prejudiced and fearful of people who have a mental illness. He was trying to get me evicted because he was afraid of me......I'm 5'6"" and weigh 125lbs. I am an excellent tenant whereas he get complaints of noise made against him.

Forgive me but this is a subject that winds me up, just a few can ever make it into that world, there is so much potential brain power that goes un rewarded. Just think of the potential breakthroughs that could happen if kids were rewarded for thinking instead of exhibitionism.

174340527,"When dating I never tell someone I have schizophrenia. I do tell him my symptoms, but I avoid the schizophrenia-word (in my case my diagnosis is a bit unclear anyway). When dating, on the profile and chats I already gave tiny hints to me being a bit different, chaotic, having a lot of life experience. I tried to phrase it in a way that doesnt set off all the alarm bells, but hints at things I can later tell more about. I think it is best to tell bit by bit. And also try to adjust the story to someone’s response and their own level of openness. I don’t want to be emotionally “naked” while they are still “fully covered”, metaphorically speaking. My friend’s advice: dont let all the crazy out at once. I try to give a positive overall message about my current life, but also be honest about fields I still struggle with. Preferably with some lightness and humour. I’m not the best dating advisor though…but I think with a bit of willingness from the other party it is possible to tell some
one about psychosis without chasing them away."
175952751,"Hi, my name is _NAME_. I just joined this community cause I can’t find a good group of people to understand what I am facing. I had friends in my pas say I am dramatic and better than everyone cause I get depress and anxious, my parents don’t really understand anything I say and believe I am dramatic too. My work doesn’t understand anything how I feel and say I am disrespecting everyone cause I keep calling off and I get rumors spread about me at work and it’s hard not to worry about anything. I struggle how to be a adult cause I never was really taught how to save and be able to succeed and take care of myself. My health has decline so much that I am starting to feel more bed bound and I am poor to even stay with doctors and stay on medication. People refuse to help me if I keep rescheduling appointments cause I can’t afford anything with being sick with something else for two weeks, I couldn’t get any money for bills and plus this year I had two bad incidents happen to me. I just want 
to give up cause I feel my mental health just collapse me and now people are thinking I am rude and disrespectful cause I don’t feel good. I can’t keep doing this so much. It just hurts and feels I lost to this darkness that covered my heart, soul, and mind. I just want to restart and I don’t want people to think I am disrespect and everyone thinks I am bad at my job and can’t find me a job cause I have bad anxiety and depression. I feel like I have no support and I am on my own which I am losing really bad too. I hope anyone got a advice. So far no one can help me and just keeps giving me one option left. I am 50/50 on it. I hope someone can understand me. I doubt it. I lost hope. Everyone keeps telling to pray to god and I am trying but I feel at this point nothing and nobody will give me support and I do the best to give everyone else support but I can’t find any. I scare everyone off with my depression and anxiety. At this point, it just shows that I am weak at being independent and feel poorly 
about myself cause I know I never have support and I can’t even support myself anymore. I hope someone could help me."

175952753,"You should consider the Dr. _PERSON_ diet. You can eat tons of carbs and still lose weight. The reason for this is that carbs without fat doesn’t raise blood sugar, and you technically don’t gain body weight from it (as long as you limit fructose.) Saturated fat blocks the glucose uptake channels in the muscle (creates “intramyocellular lipids”) and that causes glucose to pool in the blood, making the blood thicker and causing insulin resistance. If you avoid saturated fat, that doesn’t happen. Even a large amount of carbs gets used in the muscle and converted to energy or heat. Only about 2% gets converted to body fat (more if you eat lots of fructose.) So this way, you can eat lots of pleasing food and still lose weight. But the downside is that eating lots of carbs for SZ might worsen symptoms. It’s something worth trying for a few days to see if you’re happier or not."

I can hear demonic cackling outside my head and I see what I called the poison people slither on the walls floor and ceiling. They are black and slender. So if I was delusional let’s just say.

175952776,"Just venting. I met someone years ago who turned out to be devastatingly disappointing, he appeared to be something he wasn’t and I’ve had two kids with him. He has never supported me emotionally or taken my mental health seriously. He ignored an email I sent to him once about me feeling low and suicidal but that I wanted us to be there for each other and work as a team, as I was pregnant at the time. After three weeks I asked why hadn’t he replied, he said sorry he was just lazy. I always felt unloved and alone with him, he’s made a joke of me and my mental health when we had a disagreement one time. And he never asks me about anything, never takes an interest when I talk to him about my past or anything I go through. I broke it off with him a long time ago but he’s in my life every single day because we have kids and he is a good dad and helps me a lot with the kids but he has made me feel like a worthless piece of crap. I try not to take it personally but it’s hard, is it so much for 
someone to actually care about me or make me feel loved. I never had that from my parents and I guess I really wanted a family and loving partner to fill that void and it just turned out to be like this. I’ve been made to feel like i don’t matter and wouldn’t matter if I ended my life, I just get ignored anytime I try to open up about anything. He never shows he cares and I think he is an emotionally stiff person in general and all his exes have left him and cheated on him, one messaged me and said if you enjoy coming last in everything go ahead. He’s so confusing, he doesn’t seem like a bad person but no one has ever made me feel this worthless apart from my parents. I think if I wasn’t a strong person this could be very dangerous to my mental health and even still could and I’m just so angry that I made such a mistake and now I have to rely on his help when I just want him out of my life. I feel he dulls my spirit and I can’t be my energetic passionate self with him because he’s so passive 
and dull. I try to keep things to myself but it’s hard and sometimes I might let something slip and when I get zero care factor from him it makes me feel like crap. I had an ex before him who made me feel loved and appreciated and I try to hang onto that, that someone in my life did care at one point. That ended because he was an alcoholic and a danger at times. He posts things on fb about supporting mental health and said he even talked someone out of suicide in the past, so why is he so emotionally stiff with me. He’s never been really affectionate. Yet he’s wanted to marry me. I don’t get it. I worry for my mental health if he keeps making me feel this way. I need people in my life who will be there for me and make me feel like I’m worth something, I’m a good person and have a lot of love to give the right people. I’m so annoyed that I have to be tied to this person who makes me feel so horrible. I’ve tried to tell him how he makes me feel in the past with very little response. He only ever 
texts he can’t talk about anything in person, *** is wrong with this guy. I deserved so much more, I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve such a crap life."

I told my mom I do these things because of my anxiety, but she said that she has anxiety and she never does what I do. I feel so alone. I just don't know how not to be in a bad mood or not to freak out because if I do try to breath my parents yell at me to calm down which makes me start freaking out again. Can anyone relate to me?

You’ll want to spend the extra 15 bucks on like 40 spare electrode pads, cause the back skin will make them unstick quicker cause of general sweat. Also order the special medical 9 volt batteries for like 15 bucks, my batteries last about 10-12 days with me using my unit 2-4hours a day on level 3 on my hips. Honestly, it’s the external spinal stimulator they are trying to pressure people into, so a TENS has more control than the ones they implant. My Grama had the spinal implant, thing was a waste of 75k but luckily papa worked for Chrysler in the 70’s-90’s when they had benefits that were worth it. If it helps great, if it doesn’t.

I also feel kind of spacey, like I were buzzing or something, but cognitively feel numbed/dulled. I try to take the olanzapine, a week ago I had been taking it for about 10 days, but this tired feeling just wont stop. Does this go away with more time?

IOP says he’s become my security and there are attachment issues. I don’t know why. I love my husband and kids, my family and friends. It doesn’t help that my last day with him I spent locked in the bathroom and he called the cops on me. I had to talk to him on the phone the next day about scheduling, and I fumbled through an apology. It was genuine, but it lacked substance. This counselor is the one I have written about obsessively emailing him. I try not to write him while he is on vacation. Has this ever happened to you? Have you ever become so attached to someone that you feel like your world falls apart when they leave? Is there anyone you want to tell everything to and never have enough time to get all of the words out? I’ll take any tips on how to stay present with my family!

I’m sure there are plenty of studies on the subject that explain all about the endorphins released when you are petting an animal and the science behind it, but purely from experience and opinion alone, it’s easy to see a marked positive impact on my mental health and that of others around me with animals around. The benefits outweigh the loss I personally have 3 dogs and a rabbit. I used to have many more, quite the zoo, including 6 guinea pigs and a hamster, but due to old age over the last couple of years, we have lost our guinea pigs and our little hamster. Loss is the hardest part of having pets, especially on mental health once you have become so attached and they become part of the family, but the benefits far outweigh the loss. They provide so much comfort Having a pet, whatever suits you, your budget, capability and lifestyle whether that be small animals, cats or dogs, can be so rewarding. I find i

My 13 year old doesn’t want to talk about his Dad who committed suicide over a year ago and he claims his death doesn’t bother him. It worries me, but I have him in therapy and try to talk to him regularly and be supportive the best I can even if he doesn’t want to talk about things much. It’s never good to let them isolate.

My cellphone an android S8 has been difficult to charge lately so I got a toothpick and got out all the lent from the usb C port, then brushed it with a tooth brush with xylene on it. It works much better now. Honestly, I feel like they design these ports to only last a couple years so that you're forced to buy phone.

The thing is though, I don't want another central nervous system depressant like a benzo, or gabapentin. I build tolerance up to fast. The Seroquel is not my cup of tea because it messes with a receptor that fogs my mind and it doesn't work well anymore, and I can't go any higher because I get heart palpitations. I don't want ambien either because I wont remember what I did during the night. Last night went to bed at 11pm. I fi

The problem is that U can't feel sleep hormones anymore. Sex releases chemicals that use to knock me out, but ever since I became emotionally flat I no longer feel it anymore whatsoever.

I thought about buying a mobile home but the trailer parks tend to jerk people around with rent. They’ll raise you’re rent $50 a year until you can’t afford it and size the trailer. State legislature is trying to pass a law to stop them from doing the practice."

And I felt as though that medication caused me to hear voices (I wasn’t aware I had heard voices previously) However when I reflect, it wasn’t the case of voices that was an issue for me. It was the case of paranoia. On medication, paranoia is usually eventually stemmed, even if, at first you feel like the symptoms are being caused by the medication. From my experience."

175952951,"Hello Guys, I hope you all are doing the best you can to stay well and sane during this quarantine. I am a 27 year old lesbian. I recently married what people would consider a “high school sweetheart”. During the course of the relationship I lost myself and the ability to have a social life. I knew this was probably a negative sign but I proceeded to get married because I do genuinely love her. I haven’t been an angel but that’s because we got together at a very tender age I was still growing and learning. She knows everything the good and bad. How do you even consider leaving someone you’ve opened up your whole life to? It’s so hard. Then I ask I do stay and be unhappy. A lot has changed for me. I have medical issues and she actually said I wish I would’ve know before we got married. Now that we are stuck in the house I feel alone and isolated. No to talk to that actually cares that I feel I can trust. We barely connect because she’s always on some type of social media platform fro
m morning to the time we go to bed. I never felt so empty inside. She pretends to make jokes, saying hurtful things to make me feel inadequate. Despite all of this, I still do love her and don’t want my relationship to fail but I often feel like giving up. The worlds in a crazy state and home should be a place of peace where you feel welcome not alienated. These last two nights I’ve been contemplating self harm because I struggle with depression, anxiety and PTSD. I try to handle it on my own and lean on her as support but she doesn’t get it. I feel like I don’t know who I am without her and she moved on and started a separate life that I don’t fit into ? Thanks for listening!"

Last Friday, they only had 1 1/2 hours of work for me, so I didn’t get to stay as long as I wanted. I was pretty disappointed because I was ready to stay. I’ve applied for two different billing jobs with the parent company to the hospice where I volunteer. The parent company owns the office where I work - they are on the second floor of the building. They do all the administrative work for hospices in eight states. I applied for a payroll job already but got turned down because I didn’t have experience with their system. I do have the experience they are asking for with the two billing jobs, so I am hoping to get to interview for them. I said in my billing cover letters that I will be downstairs on Wednesday and Friday this week, so they could come down and talk if they wanted. I was trying to make myself accessible. Maybe the work I do as a volunteer will be helpful in findin

175952982,"Detail your body image struggles here. Mine were instilled in me at a very young age. I was an overweight child, bordering on obese at times, and you’d think with my having been homeschooled, I would have managed to avoid the teasing that comes with not having an ideal body type, but no, I got frequent comments on my weight at church, of all places. I can understand being concerned if a child is unhealthy, but that, imo, should be taken up with the parents. Anyway, I was compared to the two other girls around my age who attended services, both of whom were thin. I got comments if I got more food at potluck than them (“they eat like birds, that’s how they stay so skinny; you should eat like them”). I got comments if I ate less than them (“I don’t see how you stay so big eating so little”). I tried to brush such comments off as mere concern, but I won’t deny that they stuck with me. Then I hit a growth spurt in my teens and the excess weight vanished. I became thin and therefore accep
table in the eyes of whose who’d monitored my weight so closely before. They now praised me and even encouraged me to eat more, because where was I “putting it all now?” I wasn’t happier, though. Some years later, I got the idea to lose even more weight with a diet plan I’d come up with for myself (I call it a diet but it was really more like a budding eating disorder). I stuck to the “plan” religiously and ended up at a weight bordering an underweight BMI. I think everyone in my life was afraid for me at that point, but I ignored their pleas to get healthier. My thinness was my weapon against a world that hadn’t treated me so well before I possessed it. I maintained that low weight for three years. Three years of feeling miserable while simultaneously being deep in denial of what I was doing to myself. Then came the antipsychotics and those combined with the trauma of the breakdown that made them a necessity for me drove me to put on a lot of weight in comparatively little time. I tried a nor
mal diet and shed some of those AP pounds, only to put them back on and then some when I started stress eating to cope with some personal tragedies. I’m now the biggest I’ve ever been and I’m pretty sure I’m also the most at peace with myself I’ve ever been. My goal now is health, not thinness (not demonizing thinness; I’m all for people being wherever they are healthiest, and if that happens to be a place of thinness, awesome!). Recently, I’ve had to make several adjustments to my diet in light of some health issues. Whether weight loss comes of this or not, I’m going to do my darnedest to not obsess over the number on the scale but instead focus on the numbers from my blood tests. Thanks for reading."

175952986,"It seems like in one of your posts you mentioned an illness that made you tired. But it also said depression can make you tired. One of your posts said you were diagnosed with major depression with panic disorder, and agoraphobia which net says is fear of open spaces, crowds and leaving home. You said, “I am not on any med consistently. I was taking Klonapin....and i have Ativan...thats it! I have a Psychiatrist but ive been a bit wishy washy about what the actual problem is.” Klonapin net said is used for panic attacks and agoraphobia."" What do you think you are? What does the psy. think you are? You said your functioning level is low and “I also think that Ive been leaning on alcohol a little too much to cope...I was never an overdrinker but with all the anxiety etc ...and just not enough things to fill the time. I always feel like I cant keep up. You said, “My father in law is from a different generation..where the women must be in the kitchen...and even if Im doing smg productive I get

Net says about depression (do you think you have this?): Feeling sad or having a depressed mood; Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed; Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting; Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much; Loss of energy or increased fatigue. Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others): Feeling worthless or guilty; Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions; Thoughts of death or suicide. Anxiety (agoraphobia and panic disorder are included in anxiety) [Do you have this?]: Feeling nervous, restless or tense; Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom; Having an increased heart ra
te; Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation). Sweating; Trembling; Feeling weak or tired; Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry; Having trouble sleeping. Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems; Having difficulty controlling worry; Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Mayoclinic.org says: See your doctor if: • You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life: • Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control • You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety • You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem • You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately. Medications: Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other 
mental or physical health issues. For example: • Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders. • An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed. • In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe other types of medications, such as sedatives, also called benzodiazepines, or beta blockers. These medications are for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and are not intended to be used long term.Post Edited (_NAME_) : 3/13/2020 7:56:14 PM (GMT-6)"

175952991,"It's wonderful to take pride in one's work. But you definitely want balance and not want to expect perfection, which is impossible. You also don't want the other extreme where you feel nothing you do is good enough, as that is not true as well. “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” (Proverbs 17:17) Confiding in a loved one or in a trusted counselor can help us get a grip on negative feelings and put them out of the way before they overwhelm us. Speaking with others can help us to see things from a balanced, positive viewpoint. “Talking things out helps a lot,” admits _NAME_. “You need to tell someone how you’re feeling. Often just getting it out is all that’s needed.” Doing so will help you experience the truthfulness of the proverb that says: “Anxious care in the heart of a man is what will cause it to bow down, but the good word is what makes it rejoice.”?—Proverbs 12:25.

It's possible to do, like right now I am sick and my apartment is a mess which eats into my thoughts all day long ""I should be able to keep my apartment clean"", ""I should just get up even though Im sick and clean"", ""What's wrong with me that I can't just keep a clean house, Im 29 I'm an adult"" and I practice talking back to those thoughts & being less hard on myself, but sometimes it gets exhausting and I let those thoughts in.

174340598,"I did a lot of physical work, but not too physical. Unloading trucks was taxing but I’ve also worked in warehouses and stocking shelves. I’ve been a janitor for the past 7 years. I was a park ranger, some of the tasks were tough. Once I had to take a gasoline powered weed eater and cut down weeds on both sides of a 150 foot long fence. It took me awhile but I was rather proud of the result. Another task was planting grass seed which involved perching on the tailgate of a pick-up truck as it drove 5 miles an hour back and forth over a big expanse of dirt fields and using a broadcast planter to distribute the seed. It sounds simple but when I was doing it I was actually doing about 5 things at once while making sure I didn’t fall off on my face. And this park was huge and we were planting over huge areas and we had to go up and down, planting one row at a time and we could only do an area as wide as the pick-up truck at a time. That was a two week job, it was tough. But anyways, I worked in a c
ouple restaurants, not too tough. Some of these jobs didn’t pay well, but I always say about my jobs: They put food on my table, gas in my car and kept me in nice clothes. With the money I made at these jobs, i could afford to go to the occasional concert or play or comedy club. I amassed quite a few CD’s DVD’s and video tapes though years later I sold them all. I bought luxuries when I wanted to. I could go out to eat. My dad taught me the value of hard work, he had a family to feed and clothe and keep a roof over are head and he was a smart guy but sometimes he had to just take and decent job he could find so he worked for years on the California freeways, cleaning, planting, weeding, pruning, picking up trash etc. Then he got hired on as a surveyor and got his own crew and did that that for about 14 years until he retired. So I am happy I can do any job. I’m not snobbish or picky when it comes to work."

Not in a morbid way, but as a challenge. It’s one of the hardest parts of patients lives, and I tried to bring some comfort. Pain and anxiety medication management, helping cooking, cleaning, teaching, helping even the families, psyche work. It broke me. Largest episode I ever had was related to nursing. I started hearing the angel of death, believing he was training me as an angel. Ive only got flashes, but I was lost, zero insight. Had to be thrown in the ward. They shot me full of something that helped with the screaming voices, brought me down. I’m scared now, if I went back, would it happen again? It always seems to happen. Fear around how safe I am to practice. Miss it, but part of me knows it’s a trigger, nothing better to feed angel delusions than trying to save a life, or helping them die with dignity."

174340631,"I have often been told by my family to not have kids due to the genetic advantages of me not having kids and my brothers having them. Money is also a big deal to them as they were ashamed to have me living in the inner city. To back up that assertion one of my brothers would often say, “Girlfriends are overrated” while hugging his. However I’ll admit that when it comes to my brothers’ kids I have seen them spend tons of cash to give their daughters a fighting chance in life, and I attended the public schools and saw one of my niece’s private ones and noticed there was no comparison. I have seen the good and bad sides of the tracks and noticed some interesting things. The poor have the crappy jobs when they have a job at all (they are included in the seasonal help of which the majority won’t be around by January. The rich have the office jobs where some meetings amount to parties), they are incarcerated at a much higher rate (the poor go to jail for illegal drugs. Celebrities go to _NAME
_.), and yeah the authorities treat them differently (cops on the rich side of town look for speeders. On the poor side they look for trouble.) The poor are not necessary less happy in their relationships and in their lives but it doesn’t hurt to be rich. Of course if your rich you’ll have no more friends than the poor. They’ll be your friends and all those pretending to be your friends for your money. Marriage can be a joke with sex, money and power corrupting it. Many guys may be happy with their love lives but be going through multiple marriages. My twin has been much richer than me but was unhappy because a nearby neighborhood to his looked better. A good looking woman or man can be rich today and poor tomorrow when the wrinkles appear. With schizophrenia money is not much protection against the illness. A formally rich man can still be homeless. If the drugs don’t work you can still be messed up. The drugs can cost thousands a month. The side effects of the drugs can still catch up with you later 
on in life. There is no miracle cure for the rich."
175953172,"I had a lot of plans for today then I slept till 1pm and just feel lazy now. Had a really bad headache earlier.

174340622,Way better. It’s come at a cost for sure. Not as smart for sure but no more racing thoughts. I can sleep at night rather than obsess about things.

I have been a bit bad and had a veggie burger and chips for dinner yesterday. I gained 6 kg in six months. I was 55 kg for 11/2 years before I gained 6 kg. I have been over 75 kg I might even have been over eighty when I was on another medication many years ago. I wasover 74 kg on olanzapine. I am fit but don’t look fit.i look chubby.

My support staff make sure I get my food shopping when I get paid every Thursday and they then leave me to my own devices with the rest of my personal spends/allowance. I just spend it on beer and takeaways. My housemate is constantly asking me for money as he chain-smokes 4 packages (120g ) of rolling Tabasco a week. He also asks for money so he can buy drugs/coke. He promises to pay me back on his payday but most of the time he doesn’t. It pees when off when he owes me money as he buys a 1litre bottle of vodka instead

She was asking me if I thought I should tell her new doctor her old diagnosis or not and I said it didnt matter because they’d come up with their own regardless doctors just be like that. They all want to be like I’m the one who sees what the REAL problem is here everyone else was wrong and dumb I am the best doctor

If you do, you need to see if they can help you find a place or something… That needs to be the understanding that our mental health system has; we need to get away from these kinds of toxic people. They’re part of the problem of why people can’t get better. We need proper loving care from people who actually can be supportive and not tear you down while you’re down."

Now when I think of it one could say yes or no both could have been right. I believe if you get stressed out Relaxation Technic worked best for me, in total the Technic takes about 50 mins every day and every One hour at work, one has to just breath in and out five times. Ask per my understanding the five times one breaths, the mind and body will get connected to the 50 mins relaxation time and one would come out to stress. But at present I am not in touch with above psychologist and psychiatrist as the first is charging more and the second got retired. Anyways I still hope for the best for me at present."

Where I felt like “maybe all this mental turmoil has to do my with my sexuality”. “Maybe the world doesn’t understand me because deep down I’m a closeted homosexual” even though I’ve never been sexually attracted to males. For me it was a way to trick myself into thinking MH isnt the big problem. If you’re genuinely curious - explore it. It might make you happier if it turns out to be true. But it is also possible that it is a form of denial or a coping strategy to avoid the reality of your mental health issues."

They wanted to look at my previous month’s bank statement to assess my financial need. There was nothing in that statement that would indicate paying rent as far as I know, but the letter from my parents saying that they charge me rent was good enough for them. Later I got on CPP-D and ODSP, and I think they used the information from OW in their assessment."

My doctor said to let my body become accustomed to the medication. Anyone have any experience with Chlordiazepoxide? Thanks very much,."
175953299,It sounds like you have good insight. So you are aware when you start getting delusional thoughts. I have delusional beliefs all the time. But with meds I am able to say “That is most likely a delusion”. Versus off meds I start to lose sight of things and go from being 90% sure it’s a delusion to like 50% sure and then if i go into an episode even less than that.

174340649,"Blockquote Current antipsychotic treatments rely on dopamine D2 receptor antagonism for psychosis. However, the therapies are limited in the treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. SEP-363856 was developed as a new class of psychotropic agents with a non-D2-receptor binding mechanism of action for the treatment of psychosis in schizophrenia. As such, this study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SEP-363856 in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. The participants were randomized to receive SEP-363856 or placebo treatment for four weeks. The study determined the patients in the SEP-363856 group had a lower PANSS total score from baseline compared to the placebo group. However, one patient in the treatment group did suffer a serious adverse event of sudden cardiac death."

174340653,"Hey, come on now. Don’t get so down on yourself. We can work this out together, alright? Now, I know absolutely nothing about disability, but don’t panic. There are plenty of steps to take before panic is justified. Have you contacted the social security office? I can ask my mom about this tomorrow, as she’s good with law. My condolences. I’m so sorry to hear that your loved one has passed away. Get to the funeral venue early and choose a place to sit, then contact some of the people that you do know and have them find and sit with you. There are several possible reasons that your counselor didn’t call you today. Perhaps there was some sort of personal emergency. Maybe someone was in crisis. You’re paying, so you have a right to know if your appointment has been cancelled, but I suggest emailing him, not freaking out about his possible death. What tools have you learned that help when you’re around others? They’ll work with anyone, not just your counselor. Look for other clues too. 
Is anyone else reacting to or interacting with a possible hallucination? Is the possible hallucination wearing appropriate clothing for the event or situation? Is the possible hallucination following you around? Well, you lost the 9lbs the first time, so you can just do it again, don’t you think? There’s no set limit on how many times you can attempt to get healthier. Perhaps it would help to do one thing at a time. What’s more pressing for you, your size, your nutrition, or your fitness? Pick one and start there. Rome wasn’t built in a day. The clothes don’t have to be new. Go to a thrift store and pick up a few outfits there. Swim in some shorts and a sports bra, see about your entire household piling together all of the stuff they don’t use and the clothes they don’t wear and selling some of them. I fail to understand how their disagreements are your fault. Mental illnesses don’t fit into neat little boxes with bows on top. You have OCD, yes, but you also have schizophrenia, and like it or 
not, those two disorders are not treated in the same manner. Seeking reassurance about an obsession isn’t the same thing as reality checking a delusion or hallucination. With OCD, you know that your obsessions are ridiculous, whereas with schizophrenia, a delusional belief that your dog is an evil alien from a distant planet sent to spy on humanity makes just as much sense as the belief that 1 + 1 = 2. So no, I don’t blame you for screwing up the IOP, and you shouldn’t blame yourself either. They are being completely ridiculous, unreasonable, and unprofessional. Yeah, that’s because your OCD isn’t being treated. It’s a mental illness too, and you need help controlling it. What does your pdoc say about all of this? Do they have any suggestions? The gold standard treatment for OCD is ERP, but I believe that there are other methods. I know that some people stand by ACT, and others just CBT alone. I do believe that there are quite a few OCD therapists that do online sessions if you’re interested in 
that."
175953341,Yeah hearing that. It’s hard in most communities to get help when your struggling or in crisis. Still. It’s good you messaged them. Try not to worry about the profound things. Concentrate on getting better thoughts…kinda hard I know but maybe watch a movie you like or do something that is enjoyable.
175953342,"You can also look into seeing your PCP who will refer you to test for adult ADHD. I thought it was ""only a kid thing"" or a type of learning disorder until my husband got diagnosed at 57. Lots of hurried racing thoughts, procrastination on things that are important, anxiety over things that have to be done. It might be an avenue to consider after you've tried the other good suggestions from the commenters above."

175953368,"Hi TMO, In actuality, you poisoned yourself with vodka. That is what happens if you over do it drinking. Hangovers are no fun and I don't remember you talking about the headache you often get when hungover. I don't think with over drinking just once will give you any health issues. But daily drinking does in time. I just lost my sister in law to liver disease from drinking daily for many years. I lost a sister (in her 40's) years ago from alcohol abuse. So if I were you, I wouldn't drink much. Alcohol is also a depressant, so daily drinking will make you depressed which is no fun especially on top of anxiety. You are young, I hope you decide not to drink. It is a matter of choice I guess. I have drank in my life, had many hang overs and did throw up on occasion. I don't miss it at all. Choose wisely. I hope you are feeling better today. Hugs, _NAME_..."

174340663,"Anyway, I just did more research on LD. I didn’t know about specific Learning Disabilities. Now I also recognise the difference between Learning Disability and Learning Difficulties. In my case, then, if we go by what these words describe, I have certain Learning Disabilities. I provided my Doctor the symptoms, and he said, let them be if they don’t bother you. The therapist was also laconic when I conveyed him my symptoms. That means what I am experiencing is a rough combination of diseases. All the things combine in 3,4,5 ways when I am responding to stimuli (or external experiences). I notice when the Schizoaffective is treated well, other diseases mitigate. As the terrible loops abate. I become a more confident and able person. Nevertheless, the above method is very useful for the various facets of some types of Learning Disabilities. So, here we have it. I have 3 I think now. One would be Dysgraphia. Second would be Dyslexia. Third would be NVLD. I have inferred this based on my symptoms."

174340675,Hi all: doing well this morning after doing poorly all week due to a medicine change. I realized the medicine I was taking before was helping my mood a lot more than I knew.
174340667,"Here, here. I feel the same way. I’m thankful for this perspective."
174340660,"Hello _NAME_, first off I’d like to express my gratitude toward you for choosing to work in the mental health/medical field. As a person who suffers from a mental illness it is nice to know there are people interested in learning more in order to help. Now let’s get to talking about medications! Note: This is from my personal experience with treatment for schizophrenia paranoia. First off I’d like to say that when it comes to medication, and treatment for mental illness, it would be better to view patients as individuals. By that I mean two people can (and often do) react differently to the same medication. For example, I take 10 milligrams of Abilify once daily. There are a few posters here who also take abilify, some have stated it works for them (as it does me) others have said it did not help much. I can’t speak for everyone of course, I simply wanted to share that there is no one miracle antipsychotic that will work for everyone. I’d imagine you might have heard that already while do
ing research. Nonetheless, I felt it would be good to mention it. Onto my personal experiences with antipsychotics and treatment for a mental illness! I was diagnosed with schizophrenia paranoia when I was 20 years old. Before that I had a relatively normal and productive life. Sometimes memories of my life before schizophrenia seem like a dream. Anyway, the very first antipsychotic I was placed.on after leaving a psychiatric hold was Haldol (also known as Haliperidol) Deconoate. It was administered by a psychiatrist once a week. At the time I was newly diagnosed and highly skeptical about the illness and the medications for it. Many people seem to be during the first couple of years after first being diagnosed but again, I don’t speak for everyone. At the time of diagnosis, I was around at a fairly healthy 180 pounds (and 5’11""). The Haldol was given to me as an intramuscular injection on the butt cheek. (As a 20 year old it was not exactly a positive experience.) Well, the Haldol certainly stopped my p
sychosis however it was at the cost of some harsh side effects. I should mention that I have nothing against those who take Haldol especially if it works best for them, the thing is, it had a detrimental impact on me. In those days, I was a college student, had a job, and was physically active. (I’d play football soccer [for fun, not in a league] around 3 times a week). After receiving the first dose I went home and remember feeling slightly sore (that is pretty normal) then falling asleep on a couch. My memory is a little _USER_ID_ of those days now. Over the next two months of continued Haldol, everyone around me noticed certain drastic changes in my lifestyle. I was sleeping on the couch throughout the day and would only wake up to eat before sleeping again. I remember drooling and having some good friends who had heard I was going through some rough times dropping by to visit. Naturally, I could not work. I tried to go back to college after missing a few weeks though I had fallen behind and ended up dro
pping out. My life was effectively turned upside down. And to top it off, I had one problem (that persists to this very day); I was gaining a lot of weight. My acting psychiatrist at the time (who was excellent, the only reason why he is no longer my psychiatrist is because I moved 400 miles away) realized that the medication had begun to show some adverse side effects. The first thing he did was reduce the dose in half. That did help some although I still had side effects. (Gah! My apologies, the post is considerably long and my phone is running low on battery, I’ll continue later. If you want a very brief version of it, I have tried Haldol Deconoate, Risperdal (in dissolvable pill form), Thorazine, Prolixin, Risperdal Consta, Invega Sustenna, Invega Trinza, Olanzapine, and Aripiprazole (Abilify). Some worked better than others for me. Risperdal Consta was okay, Invega _PERSON_ was fairly good in my treatment, Abilify so far has been “the right meds” a term some posters here are familiar with when expr
essing proper treatment. Sometimes it can take years to find “the right meds”. I may have missed a med or two, however if I did, I wasn’t on that for long. Different meds have different side effects. Some people react well to meds that I did not. I just want to make it clear, I don’t want to make anyone feel less for finding a treatment that works for them. Well, time to charge my phone. I was planning on going into more detail about side effects, how my symptoms were affected, and some positive experiences I had with particular meds as well. Oh and, I was also administered medication by a nurse practitioner for about two years so you definitely can find a way to help people in a similar position to mine. Again my apologies for cutting it short, hope that helps you some!)"

An initial clinical study has shown this drug may be effective against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Unlike other drugs used for this condition, SEP-363856 does not bind to the dopamine D2 receptors, but exerts actions on the trace amine–associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1A (5-HT1A).” Wikipedia: "" …agonist at the [trace amine-associated receptor 1] (TAAR1) and [serotonin-1A receptor] (5-HT1A) receptors. This mechanism of action is unique among available antipsychotics, which generally antagonize dopamine receptors (especially [dopamine receptor D2]"" Currently, it’s in the phase 3… I hope to hear some good news in the near future."

174340678,"In depression negative symptoms emotions are present both happy, sad, anger etc while in schizo negative symptoms emotions are dulled equally so both happy, sad, anger are equally dulled. A better term for negative symptoms in schizo is affective flattening or blunted affect or in a more severe form called flat affect. This is why depressive people get strong negative emotions which make them angry, suicidal etc while in schizo and other conditions this strong emotion either happy or sad is not there and thus they wont likely affected by those situations, thoughts, criticism etc. In depression antidepressants actually numb those emotions so that those negative emotions won’t likely affect the individual as much but the side affect is it also numb all emotions equally, its like taking alcohol or sedative to feel nothing."

It seems some other entities came to earth and did an experiment by inter breeding or genetically modifying what turned into humans. It took millions of years to get from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and then suddenly “humans evolve in a couple hundred thousand years? The time line makes no sense at all. Every ancient civilization has stories about God like entities that came to earth and made contact with us. Ancient civilizations everywhere that had no contact with each other all had eerily similar stories. According to these stories these “God’s” came from a different dimension. Main stream science is now confirming the existence of other dimensions. We can only see a very limited view of what we call earth, space etc. it’s called visible light and it’s an extremely small band of light."

I notice I can’t really handle much outside stimulation at the moment im just triggered so quickly by menial things. so ill just tune out to a movie or something. if I get another episode like this in the next 6 months I may have to consider trying an ap long term. Just getting to burnt out to deal with this stuff. Im thinking I may try geodon or abilify. I figure I wouldnt add a mood stabilizer as the ap already has its own mood stablizing component.

174340710,"I don’t have it. But this might help. Vitamin b6 for TD. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Vitamin B6 treatment for tardive dyskinesia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of clinical psychiatry , Nov 2007 Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a significant clinical problem. Vitamin B(6) is a potent antioxidant and takes part in almost all of the possible mechanisms that are suggested as being associated with appearance of TD. The aims of this study were (1) to reexamine the efficacy and safety of higher doses of vitamin B(6) versus placebo in a greater sample of patients for a longer time and (2) to evaluate the carryover effect of vitamin B(6).A 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a university-based research clinic from August 2002 to January 2005 on 50 inpatients with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and TD. In a double-blind crossover paradigm, al
l study subjects were randomly assigned to start treatment with either vitamin B(6) (daily dose of 1200 mg) or placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment and then a 2-week washout, subjects were crossed over to receive the other treatment for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in Extra-pyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) scores.The mean decrease in ESRS clinical global impression scores from baseline to endpoint was 2.4 points in patients treated with vitamin B(6) and 0.2 points in patients treated with placebo (p < .0001). The mean decrease in the parkinsonism subscale score was 18.5 points and 1.4 points, respectively (p < .00001), and the mean decrease in the dyskinesia subscale score was 5.2 points and -0.8 points, respectively (p < .0001).Vitamin B(6) appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of TD. The specific mechanisms by which vitamin B(6) attenuates symptoms of TD are not clear."

I don’t have the multiple jobs I use to work. It would be a extreme hardship for me to afford to live on my own without getting a part time job and I would always be low on cash and stressed. It’s much better for me post sz, to be where I am. I pay a modest rent amount and buy meals from time to time. I am able to save up for that time when I will be on my own again when my parents are gone.

I just checked with Medicare and they said I was enrolled in their plan. I called the company back, and they said I was enrolled as of yesterday. I haven’t received a ID Card from them yet. They are a cheaper plan than the one I was enrolled in. I just sent the old company a premium payment, but my enrollment in their plan was cancelled, so I have to try and get my money back from them. I’m going to check with the head pharmacist Monday at my psychiatric care provider’s pharmacy. They used to have a data base they could look up my insurance in. I got my member ID number from Medicare. I’m just hoping she can find them in the data base, so I won’t have to show them an ID card."
175953611,this thread has opened my eyes…please talk to a friend about not wanting to kill like your mind says…I think it’s voices _AT_MENTION_ not you…you understand? It’s not you wanting to kill …it is that you are delusional.
175953612,"_AT_MENTION_ LOL I have just finished this one, it looks really nice when done although I think I got one of the colours round the wrong way. Its partial and special drill. _AT_MENTION_ , I haven’t practiced sealing much yet, but, if you wipe of the excess sealant from the top it should not take much shine off the painting. most people use a damp cloth to do that. I have used a clear spray paint on the light, the book and 2 partials and it hasn’t detracted from the sparkle at all."
175953613,Theoretically speaking- very much so. Like you though it would never have happened.
175953614,Tell that to my 16 year old brother he thinks drugs are neat and something fun to play around with.
175953615,"Yes, I'm very worried. Thank you."
175953616,"G, I am sorry to hear that you have been dealing with such a challenging symptom for such an extended period of time. Did medication bring you *any* amount of relief? Did you try an A/D or an anti anxiety such as a benzodiazepine? What other treatment options have you explored? Therapy and /or self help? If so, do you find a lessening of your symptoms when you are practicing your coping mechanisms or while you are distracted...or is this a constant sensation? Sorry I can't remember all the details of your story...maybe if you bring us up to date on some of the deets we can be of more help. S.C."

175953618,I find that maybe and perhaps due to my sz that I don’t remember the good as often as the bad. neither about myself or others or my relationships. I believe this is a way to cry out about how I have suffered from my sz. is this a type of paranoia? anybody else feel this way? _NAME_

175953621,"Just phone calls. I called the psychiatrist’s assistant to get an appointment. She’s supposed to call me back. I called the state Department of Finance & Administration to make sure they still issue state ID cards that don’t expire, before I go over there. Finally I called the landlord about my lease and housing assistance renewal. She said she’s just getting to it and will call me when she’s ready for me to sign paperwork. That’s all I did today."
175953622,"I see where you are coming from. Do you own the home Labelle by yourself? Or does your husband own it too? You are going to have to set some boundaries. For your sake. Can you sit down and talk with him? Or would it do any good? I am glad you are keeping notes, it helps to keep things straight and to keep from getting overwhelmed. The problem now though is you are stuck with him inside with you for the month. Can you still have your space? You might have to demand it, otherwise put up with him for the month. You need to learn to ignore what he says. Take it with a grain of salt for now. Over look it as much as you can if you don't confront. I guess I am saying to either put your foot down or live with it. At least until the social distancing is lifted. Don't forget about the stimulus checks coming out, it should help you. That is if you actually do want your countertops done. Seems like that would be a job for your husband though. Are these things being discussed with you or thrown at you? Whicheve

175953629,"I wouldn’t recommend benzos to anyone, in my experience they work, then when they wear off anxiety is twice as bad, and they’re super addictive.

175953634,"I was first dxed with sz in 1975. There is a lot more positivity nowadays as to what can be achieved if you have it . That,of course, requires a good clinical assessment of your symptoms and the help and support to go along with that . Unfortunately standards are not uniformly good,or even uniformly adequate . I am a little sceptical that a full (i.e no need to take meds) recovery will ever be possible for the majority of us . However I do believe that good psychiatric treatment,especially in the early years of being ill, can significantly improve the outcome . IMO the longer it takes to get such treatment the worse the outcome will be . IMO good psychiatric treatment requires a holistic approach , that means a proper evaluation of things that may occur alongside the sz such as ADHD,ASD etc . Help tailored to the whole person , and not just to his or hers psychiatric symptoms , should be the gold standard of treatment ."
175953635,"I’m not entirely sure, I can just tell you that the Amyloban works for me for both voices and nerve pain, the cheap stuff doesn’t. The majority of the people who have used the cheap stuff haven’t not gotten results from what I can see. About half of those (or slightly less) who use the more expensive Amyloban get positive results."

175953639,"When my cat gets mad about something, she likes to hiss and hit me. I could smack her, hiss back at her, but while these things surprise her, they also result in her continued retaliation. The worst thing for her is when she hisses or attacks and I don’t react. I act as if she never did anything at all and keep on with whatever I was doing no matter how angry she gets. This communicates to her that I have absolute power over her, that nothing she does will make me change my behavior in the slightest, that her biggest attacks are so beneath me that they don’t even warrant a flinch. She doesn’t run me and she knows it, and this realization alone is enough to subdue her. Voices are like that too. Ideally, whatever part of your mind that’s screaming for attention when you hallucinate should have no direct bearing on your actions. With practice, your voices will learn that you’re the one whose in charge. It’s like a sense of learned helplessness, a sense of futility that is certain and absol

175953643,"Hi _NAME_, I feel exactly the same way as you do. Its not only covid but everything else going on in the world around us. People are dying around the globe yet everyone is worshiping the almighty dollar, or yen or Euro. I am sick to death of the world we live in. When will people start caring about one another? You would think after thousands of years of civilization on the earth people would work together for the common good of all people.

174340737,"Just my experiences and opinion here, so take it with a grain of salt. My psychosis started for me before I ever started smoking weed. I do believe it can trigger latent psychosis in some people, but so can alcohol. It’s an intoxicant and therefor even less safe for someone with a genetic disposition towards a mental illness. I don’t advise people to smoke weed, it can be very dangerous like any other drug. It effects people differently all the time. I would hate to see someone suffer illness from this course of action. Just to be on the safe side, we shouldn’t really risk it, Not many of us can handle THC anymore, sends a lot of people back into psychosis. Good article dude!"

175953666,I think the only thing you can really do is to focus on a different thought. basically just using distraction. obsessing over religion is like ruminating. the intrusive thoughts ie.

175953731,"That’s not what I’m telling you. I’m just saying that the Comanches were superb fighters. They kept Spain from moving up into Texas, and they held up the U.S. westward expansion for several decades. I’ve even had my Indian friends tell me about “outlaw tribes”. I’m an eighth Chickasaw myself, and they were known as the most warlike tribe of the five civilized tribes. The Chickasaws kept the French from moving up the Mississippi River into the heartland of the United States. If it wasn’t for the Chickasaw I would be addressing you in French right now."

I didn’t have much will to live anyway. When my time comes, I’ll actually just die. Life is appalling and the _USER_ID_ is appalling, and all adds up to how useless I am. All because I have a ??????? psychotic disorder. My life isn’t worth it. I wish someone kills me."

175953738,"Abstract Exposure to neurodevelopmental adversity and childhood trauma are both independently associated with psychosis. However, there is little research on the mechanism underlying their relationship with each other. The current study investigated both the independent and joint effects of neurodevelopmental adversity and childhood trauma to better understand the etiology of psychosis. A large population-based cohort ( N = 3514) followed from birth was assessed on psychotic experiences (PE) at 24 years. Neurodevelopmental adversity included obstetric complications (birth weight, gestational age, in-utero influenza exposure, resuscitation) and developmental impairment (cognitive and motor impairments). Trauma exposure included caregiver and peer inflicted trauma up to 17 years. Multiple regression models tested their independent and interactive effect on PE, and path analysis estimated the indirect effect of neurodevelopmental adversity on PE via trauma. Neurodevelopmental adversity (OR = 1.32, 95%
CI: 1.08–1.62) and trauma (OR = 1.97, 95%CI: 1.65–2.36) independently increased the odds of PE. There was also an indirect relationship between neurodevelopmental adversity and PE via increased exposure to childhood trauma (? = 0.01, 95%CI: 0.004–0.024). In particular, peer bullying mediated the association between developmental impairment to PE (? = 0.02, 95%CI: 0.01–0.03). In conclusion, children with neurodevelopmental adversity, in particular those with developmental impairment, are more likely to be exposed to trauma. This new etiological understanding of psychosis suggests that PE may be partially modifiable through reducing exposure to peer bullying, especially in children with developmental impairment. https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/advance-article/doi/10.1093/schbul/sbaa174/6040593?rss=1"

175953741,"FP, Congratulations on getting the interview to begin with! Don't forget that this in and of itself is a great step...and tells you that you already have the qualities that the company you are hoping to work for wants! Here are a couple of other coping skills to help get you through the process with the least amount of anxiety. *Envision a good outcome! When the anxious thoughts combat them with positive mantras and imagining everything going extremely well at your interview. Picturing yourself as confident, professional and engaging will go a long way in ensuring that it is so! *Be prepared. Know exactly where you are going and give yourself extra time to get ready and get there so that you are relaxed and not rushed when you arrive. Look up online a list of typical interview questions that most employers use during an interview, so you can be ready with a thoughtful answer rather than be put on the spot. Have your resume/paperwork together and in a convenient spot ready to go the night before. Ge
t a good night's sleep and a good breakfast the morning of. *If you do get caught off guard by a question posed to you, don't be afraid to give yourself some time to answer thoughtfully, rather than saying 'I don't know', or just blurting something unintended out. I used to get thrown off guard by this as I like to process things before giving my response. I learned to say 'That is a good question, let me think about that a moment.' This gave me a little time to get my thoughts in order. Finally, be confident in yourself and your abilities! This will impress your interviewer and may even help to put them at ease...allowing the whole flow of the conversation to go really well. Best wishes, and let us know how it goes okay? _PERSON_"
174340756,So you are telling you had negative symptoms in school days? For me my negative symptoms appeared very gradually though it started at some age 8 or something like that and not even realized its gradually getting worse every year. I was very lazy to brush teeth even from very young age.

175953746,Super annoying! I feel like an air balloon/like an idiot
174340760,After I was diagnosed it made sense to me but I didn’t understand fully that medication was the solution. I just didn’t think about that part. So I spent 4 or more years after my diagnosis unmedicated and out there. I also spent 2 years before my diagnosis not capable of taking care of myself at all because I was sick. It’s funny though when I first started hearing voices sometimes they would say “your schizophrenic…” all spooky like and I immediately thought this was not true and say back to them “no I’m not cause I know you can hear me” lol. Its funny now. I’ve been taking meds now for 2 years now and I have been better and sometimes I think that everything I went through like didn’t happen and I think maybe I dont have schizophrenia at all. This thought scares me cause then I feel like I have been lying all this time. I also feel guilty if I’m feeling alright like I’m supposed to be sick. I dont know…

Those who know me personally always see me with several projects on the go. Having to park some personal businesses and my volunteering because of COVID is adversely affecting my mental health because I would normally be doing more than I am right now. The wife thing just sort of happened, wasn’t planned other than tossing out a free singles ad for the hell of it. Figured I might get a few booty calls out of it, y’know?"

174340767,"I have complained to the system but got rejected twice. Keeping up with the 3 now … So positive symptoms will come regardless if you have not been diagnosed with the medicine? In that case, I have never been able to prove that I can do without medication if there are any positive symptoms. or do I misunderstand? Sorry if it’s bad english"

175953772,"I think i know what you're talking about, when someone asks me how im doing i either say good or explain how im doing as if i was a car, i'ld say something like ""i feel bored and that i dont enjoy anything, how about you, how are you doing man?"" *smiling at the person to avoid more attention* Back to topic- i usually have too much stuff to focus about my feelings of people, im always busy in my fantasies or busy in making sure nobody crosses a line and gets too close to me, i am condescending and judgemental towards people 100 times in 1 conversation to make sure they stay far and know their limits. Lately due to therapy i feel extremely disappointed from people over 'stupid things' that are very important for me, if someone talks about a topic i have nothing to say about i get offended, if there is a snack for everyone to share i get offended when i dont get everything, i feel like i deserve it all, so take all that and add up to it the fact that i didnt develop a healthy object relation like an
y normal baby, which means i have difficulty seeing in people good and bad at the same time, they are either the devil or an angel, so i can flip back and forth in 1 interaction between hating everyone to the bone and then seeing them as angels I've become aware of this just lately, i didnt understand what this object relation theory said before because when i felt someone is bad i believed with all my heart he is the devil, and one minute later he was an angel, and i didnt find it weird, yet its extremely difficult to trust an angel when he can so easily become satan one minute later. It just ######6 hit me how hard my life was when im writing this comment, i needed this therapy so bad, i needed to unload thanks"

175953787,"I just want to be free of the addiction to nicotine. They aren’t meant to be used long term. I’ve known of a couple people to get hooked after smoking cessation for several years and I’m wanting to avoid that. I quit smoking at the end of July using the patches and started the lozenges sometime in September. So that’s more than 2 months of lozenges. Plus even though I’m spending a lot less than I did on cigarettes, it’s still an expense. The lozenges are about $40 for 80 lozenges and I use 5 or more a day. I just think it’s time to be free of the addiction even though I have to suffer for a couple days. Plus I’m hoping to get off my blood pressure meds once I get off the lozenges or at least lower the dosage."

I sometimes get into this way of thinking that I don't need treatment. It really sucks when I start thinking that way. I hate it. Also, my judgment is sometimes atrocious. I am certainly not different than all the rest. Sometimes I get so frustrated with my current pdoc that I turn to this kind of thinking though. That is my best guess, and I think it's true. That is why I am finding a new pdoc."

175953791,At the height of my illness I noticed the exact same situations. But I think it is your brain emphasising observations of police. Or possibly even hallucinating them. The brain can convince people that certain delusions are true by dwelling on certain topics and neglecting others
175953792,Sounds delish ?
175953793,"I heard that diet has 80% impact in losing weight, and exercise has only 20%. Exessive exercise only increases ghrelin hormone which causes binge eating after exercise, and thus, less-efficient for losing weight. I recommend lifting weights instead of running on a treadmil. But I do treadmil sometimes just for being healthier like preventing heart attacks or other related diseases. I use controlled diet for losing weight, instead. I did intermittent fasting for 16hours a day including sleeping time, recently and I lost 2kgs. This also has healthful effects on your organs by giving them a break during fasting."

175953800,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Trim the fat: the role of omega-3 fatty acids in psychopharmacology. _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Therapeutic advances in psychopharmacology , 2019 The American Psychiatric Association (APA) currently recommends the use of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for depressive disorders, impulse-control disorders, and psychotic disorders in treatment guidelines. This review examines the evidence for efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychosis. _NAME_-analysis of randomized-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acids for depression are inconclusive, with strong evidence of publication bias, sizable heterogeneity between included studies, and substantial methodological shortcomings in included trials. The large amount of heterogeneity in findings of RCTs of omega-3 fatty acids for unipolar depression is likely attributable to highly heterogeneous sample populations that are given different omega-3 
supplements [which differ widely in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content, ratio, and dosage] as either adjunctive or monotherapy of other existing treatments, and then measure several different outcomes of depression symptomatology with likely incomplete blinding. Evidence of efficacy of omega-3 supplementation in treating psychosis, PTSD, anxiety, and bipolar mania is minimal. The current guidelines recommending the use of omega-3 fatty acids in adulthood psychiatric conditions should be revisited, especially given several recent negative studies examining the effects of omega-3 fatty acids for cardiovascular disease. Recommending likely ineffective treatment to patients, no matter how benign the side-effect profile, has opportunity cost (e.g. other more effective medications or therapies not being utilized) and likely affects patient compliance with other evidence-based treatments."

I can give a little advice, maybe can you practice not paying too much attention to what your feelings and thoughts are? Then you can proceed to do what you really want to do with your bf and enjoy it. Your thoughts can come and tell you that ""something must be wrong"" or similar things but it is up to you to take them serious or not. It comes with practice but you can do that.

For myself, I have my psychosis brain & my physics brain & ne’er the twaine shall meet. Physics, cosmology, field theory, topology, etc (all the things you’ve touched upon) are really a heck of a lot more beautiful & interesting when you aren’t trying to come up with grande theories & conclusions to try to explain them “in layman’s terms.” Approaching from a mathematical side will help temper that. Learning these things in the “language” of mathematics helps keep one from veering too far off into a land of partially understood jargon.

175953832,"_NAME_ Thanks for checking in on me. I am wading through the chaos that is life. I have the buspar, I haven't taken it since the 1/4 tab that one night. Partially out of fear but partially bc I have adjusted to that particular change in my life. I have a follow-up appointment (over the phone-thanks covid) on Wednesday. So I will talk to him then about my fears. Unfortunately, just bc I get one episode of triggers under control (son going to school), another situation comes up. Husband was in a pretty bad motorcycle accident. Not sure when or if he'll be permitted to work again. Still dealing with trauma doctors and orthopedic surgeons and insurances. I've kept myself... Fairly together. I do have random meltdowns but they aren't, at the moment, leading to panic attacks. So, I'll put a check in the win colomn for that."

174340782,If you can tolerate aripiprazole then yes prolactin can be reduced if you r on paliperidone or risperidone but not on amisulpride. Even a low dose of aripiprazole is sufficient for most people to reduce prolactin. High prolactin on amisulpride is not dose dependent. Its worst than paliperidone and risperidone There are meds like cabergoline and bromocriptine which are dopamine agnoist which reduce prolactin very well but there is risk of worsening psychosis and schizophrenia through these drugs.

I am afraid that I will have pathologically low income since XI 2019 because they may not prolong my social pension, ruling of total incapability of work.

I tried to get work in security or cleaning (these works are most popular among those for people with ruling of disability), but they did not employ me. I think that my mental state is not better than 3 years ago. I have more even more “delusions” than in X 2016. I had very problematic OCD symptoms after getting social pension last time."

175953897,"I studied religion, and I studied hermeneutism when I was younger. I stole some grimoires from the witch in the house. But mostly it is contemplation and time. Well, you don't search for an honest man at night, all you will get are thieves, because honest men are asleep, just like good polar bears. I believe I only read his most famous book. That's interesting, so you interpreted that as the Devil commending you I suppose? That's what people meant by being possessed, although you resisted, so real possession never happens unless people agree. Free will is also about doing the right thing. That's why Christianity taught people are good by nature and have free will. Its what you do that defines you, not who you are type of thing. I would suggest you unlearn it. It takes about 15 minutes to turn an educated adult into a mass murderer last I checked. Plenty of experiments on that. But yes, in the USSR, children were ratting out their parents, and they are now doing it in democracies as well. They can h
ave been taught by others. But the first principle of morality is to seek good and avoid evil. So if the environment is evil, then it is possible the child would reject it, and by negation know good. So the reverse of the Garden above. It goes both ways. I am not against humanism, I am just pointing out it is not perfect and it is not particularly moral or good in many ways, although it can be if it respects its Christian roots. But even then I am not a fan of Christianity either, but its better than nothing. Polar bears are different than the _PERSON_, but there is no Polar Bear card, which is clearly a weird denial of existence. The similarity is about the loneliness and the asocial behavior, the difference is the search for Man and the antisocial behavior. Besides, polar bears hunt in the day, not at night, and they wait for the seal, not constantly looking for it in the wrong places. The contemplative aspect is similar as well, which I suppose it the true meaning of the card. Its my problem with Christian
ity, they don't really like hermits, and that is their loss. Missionaries are a good source of proteins, and you don't have to go look for them, they come to you, just like seals which are a good source of fat. Having a balanced diet is a virtue. But there is more to it in my mind. The wheel of history is turning and it is in nobody's control, so just like humanism is in theory the perfection of Christianity, the Polar Bear is the perfection of humanism, so it is ahead of the curve. Man is not the end goal, its not the end of the story. And men will have to follow whether they like it or not, resistance is futile. Temperance is to eat to make fat, not for canned goods, because canned goods are illimited, you can stack them, and that is what primates to. Polar bears, just like temperance can walk on water, so it is a form of justice as well. The fat tells you just how much is too much, and vice versa about the passions. If it is not part of you, then it is in the too much category and forces you to invent rule
s about private property, laws of all kinds like consent and all other types of frauds. Temperance cuts into the pork. Yeah, well it can be hard to tell the difference, but I would not call it a continuum. Truth is the judge, just like the sword in justice. So it is black and white if you can see behind the scenes, but not if you as watching the show. And that is also the fundamental difference between the two. The magician looks for causality, while the illusionist looks for categorization. Its the same difference as between morality and values. The first is practical, the second is fantasies. Like personality disorders, they are values, it is an illusionist's trick, its fantasy and idealism. Its political, not scientific. Justice is not idealist, it is based on truth and history. Whether something happened or not and how to address the problem. Its based on rules that are written, so based on authority. A judge that would judge on his or her values would be unjust, just like the one breaking the law for his 
values would be unjust. In the story of the Garden, good and evil are values. They are the fruits of rebellion. And in this case, also the fruits of passion. Passion drives tempts to rebellion and make up values. And it is not to say values are bad, they are good and bad, but they have nothing to do with justice. Someone who thinks their values are just, is simply delusional. A God walking amongst the forest, who frightens animals and children alike. I am giving it only to understand the Aristotle's metaphysics so to speak, not everything is true in that article, but that part is pretty decent. Individuals that reproduce themselves despite the rules not to do so, destroying the whole organism, just like the God walking in the forest. I do believe they are authentic, so authentic they want to share the grandiosity. They are zealous and empathic, just very small minded. Its impossible to reach while still being social, or part of society. And its a game with masks and deceit, so the path of authenticity is to l
oose big time, be the biggest looser, and that's how you win back your self. But you have to care about the self, or you will die. So its not for everybody. It takes a lot of work as well, so it is the hardest path in the end. Its just easier to follow authority and conventions, but then you have to be grateful for it, otherwise, there is no purpose to it. Yes, but he was also looking in the wrong place, and wasn't honest himself. If he had searched inside or in the good places, in the light, then maybe. He was deceiving himself. Its something. Here is the final scene of the Dark Knight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTVqQ0lbYLM _NAME_ is a humanist. He had plans and ideals, and it failed, and he blamed the world. Now, of course, carrying a lantern in the night, may attract attention of Jokers. Yes, there is premeditation of a crime. But it is inevitable in some way from the start. This is from _PERSON_ begins. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTq93_VQGuw Totally blue flowers are hard to spot though. https:/
/external-preview.redd.it/j0yTP6 ... 177549b105 Ras will have to wait... So here is the thing. It starts with a humanist looking for criminals, just like the _PERSON_, or similar, maybe the reverse _PERSON_. Then he becomes an idealist, or the idea itself, which is like zeal. So you have this deal with justice, but more importantly hatred of criminals. So it is the reverse of the above, but the principle is the same. He creates a criminal in order to humanize himself. In the second movie though it is reversed in _NAME_, who becomes the ideal man and he gets dehumanized by the _PERSON_. But then again, he was cheating, it was just a mask, which is why he was two-faced. So the ideal of the first movie, created the ideal of the second movie, and they in the end both fail, because a pragmatist came around and messed up with their plans. They had to make a choice and could not live with it, since it broke their ideal. Once they killed, they were no better than the criminals, not human anymore. Its not done volunta
rily in this case, but is it not always the case? So again, it is that rebellion against how things are, and how they will be, then gaining freedom and individuality, according to a value or an ideal, becoming that ideal, then falling from grace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y23E0OgEHuY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmnKbBmYii8 Yes, by the tarot cards. Just because people are ignorant today does not mean they always were. Yes, but that is also what _PERSON_ thought at first. The road to PF is paved with good intentions. That's what _PERSON_ thought as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaRlTrSNcE But then, the problem is more about the definition of happiness, not happiness itself. People thought and still think those things will give them happiness, just like people chose the happy path as well in the Garden, or at least they thought so, and so did _PERSON_. But they knew better or should have known better, since they were told. But they chose the other path, because it was easier. In other words th
ey are seeking in the wrong place, just like the Hermit card. Yes of course it was, it always is, but it was their own definition, and it became the goal itself, which is inevitable, since there is nothing else. Of course, you can make it yourself, but if it includes primates, they are indecent. Its the chicken and the egg problem. Which comes first, the primate or the human? Humanists say the primate comes first, and are looking for humans, it is a work in progress. Christians and most people in history thought men came first, and in the case of Judaism, that there was a war of the apes, so men created apes in order to play God. But the keen eye of the Polar Bear only sees apes either way. I would go on a limb and say 99.88% and the 0.12% are the rests of a missionary. I'll finish it later. Really annoying thing. Well, really disgusting, bad food. Yes, but like I said, it is a normal course for humanism, it was designed for that purpose, and it was the new happiness to be had, all about choice and individual
ity. Its good for Polar Bears, not for some primates, but primates are free to be unhappy. It would need a change of paradigm, and nobody wants it. Its like climate change, everybody needs to work together or it does not work at all, and people disagree because they are humanists, they speak different languages, just like in the Tower of Babel. Its the Tower card, and I guess it is humanism itself. And as you see, both men and women are thrown down individually. But they were already separate inside the tower, they could not communicate anymore, because of different language, and they thought their construction would be better than how they were born, and there was lots of place for canned food. All people can do at best is figure out individually on an ad hoc basis, and yes, it is a lot of work, nobody said humanism would be easy, it was supposed to be hard. So now, people want to go back, but it is too late, the tower is gone. Primates need to grow a fur, stop wearing dead fur or their killings. Well, the h
umanist position was that there was no difference, so that was the humanist project, and also it was Christian. People simply found differences in order to fight and have war, in order to win, but that was also inevitable. Take out the structure and the rules of the game, and there is no more game. So it was based on an illusion. That's why people have to beware of illusionists. Its too late now though. Its the same with race, it was supposed to be invisible, that was the game. People cheated quite simply. There is no ultimate solution to those problems of inclusion, or at least, nobody found one. Segregation and shared activities was the solution in the past. It works, but it means specialization and therefore roles. They aren't rare, they are almost an every day thing, so the solution is pretty obvious, at least for men that are smart. But even those situations are not safe either, there just is no safe, not if you can utter a word. Constant surveillance is not safe, everything you say can be held against y
ou is not a way to live. Its like posting on PF, but the stakes are higher. You were censured, but there was no punishment. If you had to loose everything for that same mistake, then you would think twice about posting here, or you should. And it affords a possibility for women to work for themselves, so the solution is pretty obvious. Or it would be if it was not a lie, and everybody knows it. Its a game people have to stop playing quite simply. Yes, it is a double bind situation, which means no contact automatically. People shouldn't even think about it, just don't play the game, or else get crazy, and you will, it is a promise. Yes, that is what I meant. He is genuine in ways others aren't. Not to say he isn't hiding things, but what you see is pretty much what you get, at least in some things. Children are supposed to stop lying at some point, but if there isn't any incentive, they clearly won't. But then they cheat themselves of a meaningful life and meaningful relationships, and get upset and resentful, 
etc. Unhappy. More people like _PERSON_, people to stop caring what other people think about themselves, and people stop caring what other people think or some other people and so on and so forth. Not that _PERSON_ is the end thing, but it is a baby step in that direction. He is just acting, but what if he wasn't? If a parent is good at something, chances are their children will be as well, or it is more likely, both genetically and socially. So they are good at what they do and of good breed. Its not something that exists anymore, of rarely, for many reasons. Christian values, but also their own value as a class, which is to lead and to do politics and war properly. But also, one thing they could not do, is economics, and it is where they failed the most, since it was outside their area of expertise, and none of them wanted to become merchants, because it is vile. Its a lot of things, and everybody had their issues. Like in the US, it was a lack of representation. The aristocrats were clueless and on the oth
er side of an ocean. Basically they lost their legitimacy to rule, but why differed. The most predominant was probably the economy in the cities, and a general lack of knowing the people which were too numerous and diverse. General corruption, love of money, making bastards. Plenty of things really. But they got booted for some values and immorality. In that context, it would be do what you are told, or those things you are told to do. Humility being one of them, obedience another, but then again, it is the tricky part, because obedience had to be denied because they had to get rid of aristocrats. It was a means to an end, not a scorched Earth thing like today. But also intemperance, especially in terms of money, which also ties in with the problem of aristocrats. So greed had to be good. Its like overcompensating for problems, but then again, its not like religious authorities were listening either. They kept the love that neighbor part, or at least they thought it would be kept, it was obvious, but I guess, 
forgot to mention, it was assumed. Some did though, like in the French Revolution, there is fraternity in the streets, but not in the actual declaration, the paper thing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarati ... he_Citizen Must be an omission right? If I can see it, it is a primate. If I can't see it, it is human. I heard humans taste good, like a seal but better. Their muscle structure is similar to Polar bears, which is why they taste good. Well, it is a primate issue, but there are always reasons for eugenism, so it is not like nobody believed in it, which was the point. Yes, or some other things, like killing people. Basically, any rule was inhuman, so they were wannabe Polar Bears. Some humanists like in the US were Christians, but some others weren't. In Germany, philosophy was that humans were animals, and should act as such, and anything else was a sin, so it is the reverse of the Tarot cards. Primates with synthetic fur. It was a train of thought in humanist circles in the 19th century and a bit b
efore. So for guys like _PERSON_ or _PERSON_, people are animals, and humanity is but a construct that is meaningless, or at least the one liberals and communists believe in, which is a denatured animal. Germans wanted to get back to nature, and be animals, which they did. That was their democratic emancipation, which others didn't like. But they all agree that no rules was better, except for the Germans. They have that one rule, and Germans were not part of the plan. Germans had bad intentions. Hollywood psychopaths are really intelligent. Masterminds that can predict your every desire and fool you in complicated schemes. They changed the definition at some time, so the IQ was not relevant anymore. The new psychopath was normal intelligence, or unspecified, but had some authority issues, and it became personality disorders or borderline in psychoanalysis, then came the Hollywood one, which is perfect evil. Not sure what you are asking. They got rid of idiots, and there still are plenty of idiots, so clearly 
it has failed. They didn't understand genetics well in those days, and it is still the case, but the idea that you can get rid of a phenotype is pretty dumb. That you can get rid of crime through genes is moronic, so they should have killed themselves, just like the modern equivalents. More like the liberal humanist world order, so no. Its mainly a thing of the 19th century, which in itself was a precursor of eugenics programs. All of those things were to eradicate poverty, but the _PERSON_/competitive idea of progress meant also people have to die, whether directly or indirectly, unless excellence is not achieved. Its a secular humanist morality. It was also one reason they killed aristocrats, because they didn't work, so killing them was progress. But killing the poor is even more progressive. Or the old, or the child. They are all useless. In fact everybody is useless, so that would be the ultimate progress, just kill everybody, and that's the plan. Like I said, work in religion was spiritual first, and th
at can be done by doing nothing useful, and to some degree it is best when it is the case. This being said, work was still encouraged because idleness causes acedia and ultimately antisocial behavior. So it was a means to an end, not about survival. Real Christians thought they would die tomorrow, so all they needed was enough to get there, or at least it was the idea. So no need for killing or stocking on canned goods and all that. Maybe not tomorrow but soon, that was the general attitude, and on top of that, nice people would get eternal life, so only a moron would not help others. So it could be an act of caring, for oneself and others, not a requirement. So you could have people who's only job was to pray, and people would take care of them, it was fine, as long as they did not do antisocial things. Its usually the case, because religions are to create community for everyone, in theory, so there are old and young, maimed and well, less intelligent, more intelligent, and plenty of different types of peopl
e. When it stops doing that it fails, just like any society that fails to do it gets destroyed eventually, it is only a matter of time. Not sure if that is what I meant, but it is one type yes. Can't loose those slaves. Yeah, they might think they are, and some are, but most aren't, otherwise, it would not be there. But its part of the plan. Polar Bears can't be slaves. But slavery has many forms. wage labor is worst than slavery. I am not talking about Hollywood slavery, which is horrific. Real slavery wasn't always that bad, it depends on the masters and cultures. Take Greek slaves, a lot were teachers, and lived in the house of the master. Some others were pretty bad. Religion was also about being a good master. Of course you don't want to be slave to a humanist, which is what people know and imagine. A humanist master would be like in the Hollywood movies. In the US for instance, which was on the bad sides, plenty of slaves thought it was better. They thought it was better to work hard and have few freedo
ms, than to starve on the side of the street. I heard some audio about it, some lived long enough to be able to be recorded. Lots of them were fairly well educated, with good character, and happier than the average young adult today, it is not even close. It provides structure and security, which humanism does not provide, because freedom. Its important to know, that it is the plan. People sometimes become slaves voluntarily, in religious communities, and it worked in the past. It does not anymore, because the masters are humanists, and they abuse people, rape them and so on. Yes, but even then, it has to be done in private, or with select few people at best. But here is the point, it can't be a goal in itself, not in society, so there is no need to pretend, unless you can tell me a polar bear can eat a seal in a meeting room, or anywhere in public. That is authenticity, and people won't like it, so there is nothing to work about. Its just an illusion. And it is a dangerous one at that. So you can act in soci
ety and be moral and decent, or you stay home. Authenticity is a trap, it is a where people die. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLVjt4PNtAE Mine is seals, then salmon, but over all the Burger. Sleeping is nice too, but after. Sure. What my problem is, is to tell people ""be yourself"", or those type of lies. Nobody wants others to be themselves and people know that, and in which way. Its not about answering question, but about knowing what you want, and be able to communicate it. If someone does not know, there is no point in asking questions. And of course if the goal of asking is just to try and whine about it, it is another problem. So there are presumptions in what you say, and I don't take them for granted. As if any time you want with whoever you want, and all that. Free to have sex, which was considered sacred before. You could turn around it, but not touch unless with some ritual, like getting married. The problems you talked above, were cause by this desacralization. So people say it is not sacred, 
until it isn't. So it is whimsical and mentally abusive. Not too many, not live ones. But it is missing the point. If you are looking for an authority that will agree with you all the time, you won't find it, except inside yourself. But accepting authority in itself, can be good if you have the right attitude. Whether the actual authority is good or not, is irrelevant. Of course if it is not tolerable, it isn't, but it is another problem, but even then, people have gone to great height, because they were abused by an authority. That is where people are at their best. Ok, let's take an example, _NAME_. He had to deal with a bad authority, and he did his best, and didn't rebel like a child, but he kept his honor through all this. He left eventually, but it is the attitude, and it makes him a better person. Obedience is a virtue, it has to be learned. Its also what makes good masters, because they know how to obey. Those that can't are always tyrants when given the chance. Someone that does not obey, should neve
r lead, ever. So guess what, she does not obey, because she is undermining the authority that was given to her. She is a mole. Moles need to be blown up with dynamite, lots of it. This being said though, obedience is to live with it somehow, even if you don't like it. The other is to rebel against illegitimate authority. Or something. It is up to you, but the first option is probably the best. You shut up, and roll with it. Its not like it will last long. Its a difficult subject, and I am not good at it, so I may not be the best to ask. Yes, that is the unfortunate result. She wants to be a humanist and not blaming the mother, thus sacrificing the child. She is a follower of Molech. Yes, I can't say I can give advice here. Is she in charge of those services? if she is just some teacher pouting, it does not matter that much. You obey because you are told, for the time of the class, then you can refute her or something. Make a paper denouncing it, since others agree with you if I understood well. But you have t
o obey first. Try to understand her point of view and so on, be able to reproduce it, and then once it is known, you can challenge, taking on both sides. Its true there was a lot of mother blaming in the past, probably too much, and we don't know how much is bad parenting, or children just born this way, or what. Also, I don't know those theories, at least not the childhood part, I know only more or less the different types of attachments. Maybe it will allow you to go deeper in the problem and find a solution. Its by being challenged that people do great things, not by fleeing duties, and this is true generally. But then again, some mothers are bad and need to be denounced as well. Momsters. But when it is too general, it may put anxiety in others that aren't bad, just unsure of themselves, so there is some truth to what she says, and what you say. That's my opinion, just like that, no expertise here. To be honest though, I believe those categories are too broad, and yes, I am aware that they are trying to p
inpoint children for early intervention based on those correlations they make, which to me sounds superstitious for the most part. No, but its the way the system works, so I live with their decisions, unless it is really bad. But then again, I rarely vote, so. I can't say they do a bad job, at least here. The question is more about if I were to do it, would I do it better? and could I do better if people were always complaining? probably not, so I let them do their job, until election time if needed, which is the time and place to criticize and stuff. Not that I bother with it that much. That is true for lower education, higher education, in some fields, especially social sciences, there is no curriculum, because there is no real truth, so it is all political, and it is about the authority more than anything else. In other words, they have a lot more leeway usually. Yes but in theory, they went through this as well. Its not uncommon for a bunch of students to just go through the motion, then they all decide i
t was crap and they redo the whole thing, so a change of paradigm. Sometimes they have to wait until some of the older folks die, sometimes not. Its a master slave relationship, and yes, it is what humanism didn't like, but they kept it nevertheless in Universities. If the field is attacked though, by someone, then they will go after the authority, not you, so you are safe. Yes. Its not perfect, and it sucks when you are being abused by them. I was quite a bit, by many. One of them simply abused me straight up, in the introduction course. I hadn't done anything, he just had prejudices and there had been gossip of some kind. He was reading mind as well, an empath. So I said yes sir and left the course. There is lots of abuse in Universities, but then again, there is lots in the workplace as well, or anywhere. Its the unfortunate reality, which is why the North Pole is better, no global warming, just nice fresh air. I should have sued those clowns, and all the others of the same kind, but there are too many of 
them. Well, I am in court with some new ones, so its a start. If I win, they will be on the hook for potentially millions. That should teach them something. I didn't say they themselves did, but the society in general did, and at some point, unless under duress, they chose it too. But its allowed, it is part of the plan. The only question is whether people like the plan or not, because those people will always happen. Yes, and pretty much a lot more, all that to save an institution. Some other problems will appear even in the best of systems. Everybody has to sell themselves. Sex is just easier to start, low capital investment, but we all sell something, that was the plan. This is just a commodity like any other. Its being slave of the system, and others, but there is no master, nobody is responsible, therefore there is no redemption. Clever. They can get out anytime, so there is control. Its something to ponder upon to really get it. May take years, who knows. I can't say I get it all. Kraven wants to beat S
M, but entirely, and to take his place and to better than him. So its like a narcissist injury he had over the years, being defeated. But it was the symbol that he thought was defeating him, not the man, he only saw the appearance, not the truth behind the mask. _PERSON_, is used for that purpose, for some reason SM could not defeat him in the past, so _PERSON_ does, but _PERSON_ is interesting. He was hurt by people, and was experimented upon, then became a cannibal. In some ways, he wants to be human, just like _PERSON_ eats spiders to become the spider, although it is unconscious for _PERSON_. But _PERSON_ is a victim in all this, the stuff humanism rejects, the anti-hero, the trash, so he hides in the sewer. SM is the hero, and he represents what defeated Kraven, socially. He is a hero, fighting for freedom and so on, rights of animals perhaps. Anyway, you can look at it the way you want. I think it is a good story, and there is deepness in it. Symbolism is something to work on, it is rarely given just li
ke that, and searching is the goal in some ways. You keep it in mind and someday maybe, it will make more sense, you will get what the author wanted. You will have reached empathy. It deals with spirits though, and how eating things make you those things, which is something to think about. Human, animal, what's the difference? what is a mask, and authenticity? all questions it raises."

175953904,muy bien com estudiante des loci senor que?
175953905,I think low ranking jobs hold no status and praise from the material world which praises the collection of things. I think lower ranking jobs have a moral incentive that can be appealing to some but no material incentive. Lower ranking jobs require less motivation and prerequisite training all while having little incentive to do the job. This can breed cynicism over time or discontent from no praise which would begin the decision making model once again for a more appealing job; one with status. It’s cyclical.
175953906,"I read the book biocentrism which I thought was ????????. Basically it said solipsism is true in the extreme sense and each person/each consciousness has their own reality in their mind where the external world isn’t real. He believed in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. I believe in many worlds theory. Do we live in a sim? I don’t know and try not to care. Its a daily struggle. Don’t think I go a day without questioning my reality. I sometimes think there are people outside this reality like in the movie the matrix, where there are 7-8 people dreaming. 7 -8 dimensions or variables + 4 dimensions of space time. That gives 11-12 dimensions total. Outside the simulation should be another earth or universe simulating us. M theory. I guess its similar to a window or terminal on a computer and how one interacts like a browser. I sometimes take on the stance we live in a Christian simulation that is cyclical or repeats itself. I was told 2 computer simulations exist. _NAME_ said a 
variable was changed. I feel like I changed that variable. Its odd. I feel like I made it out of the simulation before and ran it with other people. I’m stuck here now and I experience consciousness transfer or reincarnation. It sucks. I have no proof but it is like a maze that I’m uncovering. These are my thoughts. There should be infinite amount of dimensions in a theoretical sense. Its odd because if many worlds theory is really true, why am I always sick and am in a time loop that begins in 2013? Might be a false reality with constraints. I’ve been to alternate realities before. I just have the memories. I found out we live in a torus universe."

The voices I’m hearing now (when I hear them, which is not often these days) are different from the ones that tried to stir up foolish thoughts (which I think was their way of helping me to think in a more enlightened way and work through a lot of all the useless things I was dragging around - but it hurt like hell at the time), the ones I hear now have truth to them and can often be proven."

175953948,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:_PHONE_NO_ EndHTML:_PHONE_NO_ StartFragment:_PHONE_NO_ EndFragment:_PHONE_NO_ In this instance, I think that what they may be refering to is the idea that you don’t just “let go” of percieved failure, instead, you beat yourself up with it. However, it’s possible that they’re just saying “You need to learn to slow down, and give yourself a break. You’ll feel all the better for it.”, although, that’s less likely because if you’re manic…That would be sort of like saying “Just stop being manic!” which if you could do… Some cultures place a lot of emphasis on personal acheivement, my guess is that you’re from such a culture. Motivation is wonderful, but I will never be “hussein bolt” no matter how much I train. An “Ok, so maybe I’m not going to win Olympic gold, but then, look at what I have accomplished.”, type of attitude, rather than an “I’m a failure!” type thingy, followed by a “dark period”. I have met people from “ personal 
acheivement” cultures, and to listen to their outlook on life is strange for me. You are not the master/mistress of your own destiny, hardwork and dedication will bring you material gain, but the amount of “sucess” that you have in life depends upon too many unknown variables. It’s a bit like staying super-fit, in order to live longer, and then dieing at 32. Well you got the benefit of being super-fit, but you “failed?” to beat death… Just take a more realistic tack if possible. Be a “winner”, but also take the time to be a realist and give yourself a pat-on-the-back for what you did accomplish or learn, don’t get all down on yourself."

174340803,"Hello, I grew up in a house hold with my older sister who has schizophrenia. She’s 9 years older than me and when I was 10, she was diagnosed and I didn’t understand anything that was happening. She was angry all the time, yelling and threatening my family and I constantly. I was scared for my life everyday till she moved out when I was 15. She isn’t just schizophrenic, she has other mental disorders as well. Such as depression, Bipolar disorder on top of being overall mentally handicapped. I know her violent outbursts weren’t her fault, but I’m really struggling with how to forgive her. I’m 20 now, she’s 29 and it’s hard for me to be in the same room with her because she effected me so greatly. They finally got her medicine in the right place to where she doesn’t have outbursts, but I guess the medicine is killing her liver slowly so they’ve been trying to take her off of it but I’m worried she will start her outbursts again. Anyway, how do I deal with being in the same room 
with her when I’m still secretly afraid of her? She doesn’t understand all the pain and hurt I’ve been through, so she wants to make normal conversation and I physically can’t without feeling ill. Any advice please?"

175953970,"I think you should give it a go. If the perphenazine is being lowered slowly, I’d do it. I know you don’t want to risk messing up your already solid med routine, But sometimes we have to make adjustments. Maybe keep a journal of your symptoms so you can compare how well you are on/off that particular med. Share that with your pdoc and it’ll keep you on the right track."

I originally ordered my stuff from Best Buy and then they cancelled my order 4 *business days* after I placed it. Then I looked at Amazon and the delivery timeframes are ridiculous. So, I got frustrated and just ordered directly from the manufacturer's website. It's like $5 return shipping for a $12.99 item. I can technically use the PS4 pair since I have a PS4.

175953988,"I finally found self-worth and ditched a friend I’ve known since school. He had done many bad things to me in the past such as robbing my house of my computer (my only possession of any value at the time) when I was in the hospital and many other bad things. We had some fun times when drinking most times but other time he become violent. After a incident 2 years ago I blocked him on Facebook and blocked his number, didn’t speak to him for 2 years and then I get a email off him saying he hopes I’m doing well and keeping safe in the covid crisis. I email him back and say thank you. We spoke for a few weeks, texting each other. I kept thinking about all the awful things he’s done to me over the years. I decided to email him and tell him my supported living manager isn’t happy I’m communicating with him and it is causing problems, that I’ve moved forward in my life, cut the drinking down and had no drama since we fell out. I don’t want contact any more. He writes back saving it’s fine 
but the email got more passive aggressive. I didn’t hear anything for 3 weeks, yesterday he emailed mea nd said he needed to talk and that he’s been unwell with kidney problem and having tests, He’s unwell. I didn’t email back, I know this is a trick to get me talking to him again. He didn’t mention it when I was talking to him them weeks. I’m done with him. I invest my time with true friends who treat me well. I value myself as a person."
174340802,I think he does not understand that schizophrenia is a medical illness. Brain is an organ and it is part of the body. This applies to other medical illnesses or physical illnesses. I think telling him about the nature of this illness would be really helpful.

175954033,Hi Everyone! My depression is very bad today because it has been almost a month now since my old Case Mgr _NAME_ accept a new job offer in a different department. So since she said yes they assign to this new lady name _NAME_. The biggest problem that I am having right now while _NAME_ was working with me helping me for the pass 4 years I got really attached to her. I consider her to me a friend instead of my Case Mgr. So now I am having the hardest time letting her go and giving my new Case Mgr a chance to help me. They told _NAME_ a few weeks ago to block my cellphone number on her work phone. So I can't call her but I did download all these apps to my phone that gives you a second number so you can call somebody who has blocked you. So I have been doing that. Today I called her from a different number she had no idea it was me so she answer her phone. She told me that she couldn't talk because she had a client in her office then I asked her then can you call me back after you are done working wit
h your client? She said _NAME_ you know I am not allow to call you back. I was like why _NAME_ then she said _NAME_ I really can't talk about that right now then she hung up the phone. Then I just sat on my sofa just crying my eyes out. Does anybody have any hints or any good advice that could help me to let go of _NAME_ before I end up getting myself into huge trouble? I am about to cry right now. All these bad ideas are going through my head right now that _NAME_ hates me so bad that is why she accepted the job offer so she could get away from me.

175954054,"I think there is a wide range of things that falls under traditional medicine. I tried nutrition, herbs and cupping (Chinese med). The herbs i tried were helpful, some of them, but they too had a lot of side effects. I felt like i nor my herbalist really knew what we were doing. So i decided to just solve my problems instead of suppress them. I only use saffron still, on rare occasions. It helps against anxiety and depression (shouldnt be combined with antidepressant). The cupping afaik just caused huge ugly circles on my back temporarily. I try to stay away from all the “spiritual” healing stuff because it doesnt fit my faith and it scares me. E.g. someone proposed i do a 3 week shamanistic ayahuasca healing against sz, but that seemed like a pretty risky undertaking. My mind is crazy enough without hallucinogens. Nutritional healing i should try again. Good food is the start of being healthy, though it doesnt cure everything."

However that job is postponed indefinitely because they can’t schedule an orientation for me yet. What should I do?

174340820,"Hey so thought I’d give an update, I got my bloodwork back from my primary care doctor and my hormones are all completely messed up, she says I am basically in menopause right now (I am 24). I have had the hormonal IUD out for 2 months now and she said my hormones should not still be this way that long after removal so something is wrong. My thyroid levels are low as well, and they have never been low before. All things that are likely the culprits of my weight gain. She is referring me to an endocrinologist who will hopefully provide me with treatment so I can begin to lose all this weight. Due to that I cancelled my appt w my pdoc and decided not to switch back to geodon. I feel relieved because geodon did not work as well for my symptoms as rexulti does and of course the side effects were miserable and I was not looking forward to taking a step back.

175954100,Hey _PERSON_ I’m not sure tbh. It varies for everyone. Probably best to ask your pdoc he may have a better idea than me. I’m not sure wen you’ll start to feel better on 7.5mg. It may take a while but it may not. In 2018 when I went from 5 to 2.5 I noticed an immediate effect on my sleep pattern but other things took a long time to change.

So then they called an ambulance. Which was also scary. I thought I was going to be chopped into lots of small pieces with a scalpel. It’s interesting how such scary experiences really do stick in your memory. Sort of well."

Also she gave me some lidocaine spray and it distracts me too for a short period of time. Maybe that can help your niece, and to get her healed use topical steroids mixed with triple antibiotic ointment and the lidocaine for pain and of course distraction and ice helps with pain too."

175954137,"My parents have never had a good marriage as long as I can remember. They are both stubborn and irresponsible with money. I have begun to suspect that my father has some bipolar tendencies. As a result, yelling and screaming was common place in my home growing up. My parents were nearly always fighting about something, mostly money. They separated once about 10 years ago, but have stayed together until recently. There were threats of divorce as long as I can remember too. Recently though, they actually got divorced, but are still together. They live together, go out, all the things they did before, but they are technically divorced. They haven't told anyone they are divorced, including me. The only reason I know is because my youngest sisters who still live at home told me. Well yesterday my mom and sister went to stay with my other sister who lives in town because of another bad fight. I've been told, this time my mom is searching for her own apartment. I guess I just don't know how to handle my p
arents. I love them both, and they were good to me in their own ways, but they are emotionally draining. My father especially has a habit of being emotionally abusive or having strong opinions and you can't change his mind. He was always nice enough to me if I kept to his rules, but he has been emotionally abusive toward my siblings. I want my daughter and I to have a relationship with him, but I feel like everytime I begin to miss him and remember the good qualities he has, he does something to make me want to cut off ties. As for my mother, she has brought on massive credit card debt more than once and has also had relations with other men in the past. How do forgive them for their past mistakes? Am I better off avoiding contact with them? How do I protect my sister at home without crossing any lines? I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to avoid getting hurt again myself."

I told him I had side effects at 25mg and was afraid of more side effects (insomnia and very jittery) at increased dose. So he gave me Klonopin and said take that at the beginning, while getting used to the SSRI. Anyone else do that? Seems like a good idea. I do not want a benzo addiction, but the doc said small dose for a short period, while getting used to the SSRI, will not come close to causing addiction. But it will enable me to sleep and reduce the (very uncomfortable) morning jitters."

174340838,"It’s not normal to have no money. But how long has it been since you were diagnosed with schizophrenia? After I was diagnosed I was jobless for 3-6 months. I had one temporary stint as an accounts assistant which I took just to put something on my CV. In that time I was on something called jobseekers, which worked out to be about 200 every month; this i had for about three months. You are absolutely right to feel trapped. Your parents may not understand just how big of a deal these conditions are and are still adapting. Mine were. They expected me to be able to have a full time job just because my CV from before diagnosis was good for my age. A year maybe two later, my parents are realising that my health will stop me being able to hold down a full time job typically. Even though my health has massively improved; they are seeing how it really effects me and realising what it can actually do. I feel for you. It’s not easy finding work without a car. A lot of employment requires travel. However o
n a positive you can drive, so you do have the skill. I would say try to make yourself happy. Keep listening to music and using Twitter as you say you have done and you will see things will change. Nothing ever stays the same imo. My recovery has all been down to three things. Music, twitter and walking. And I was regularly told I was making an incredible recovery. It can happen for you too. If the SSI thing works out. Just make yourself happy with it. It’s not going to be much, but it should let you go to a coffee shop. or to use a bus to go to interviews. Put your goal of getting a job and being happy first at all times. You deserve your own sense of identity and security which is not tied up to just what others have to feel and think of you. Unfortunately when you are trapped financially it becomes even harder to see yourself as your own person with own personality. It robs you of your living. In society where survival is based on money and not self sufficiency."

175954156,It’s a weird thing that although the drugs do their thing…ie receptor occupancy quickly and in the first 24 hours it can take a while to get results. Usually your looking at a time frame of 4-6 weeks for decent gains but it’s probably also dependent on you coming out of psychosis or depression. Hang in there. You’d expect some gains after a month but it’s a slow process but it is worth it if your getting it right.

174340844,"I can’t remember the exact costs of my medicines, but a box of 30 capsules of aripiprazole 10 mg costs around to R$ 350. It’s around to U$ 85. Good psychiatrists charge around to R$ 350 too (U$ 85). Good psychologists charge around to R$ 200 for each session (U$ 50 each session). I would say you would have a cost of around R$ 1850 (U$ 447) a month with mental health here in Brazil (if we consider buying two boxes of antipsychotics, monthly psychiatrist and 4 sessions with a psychologist). The problem here is that our wage is very low. A regular job with no degree requirement pays just around to R$ 1200 (U$ 290). But if you have an engineering degree, you may earn R$ 4000 (U$ 1000). _USER_ID_: fortunately, I use just half a box of aripiprazole a month, consult with my psychiatrist each 2 months and I’m not going to therapy, so I have a cost of just R$ 350 a month with mental health (U$ 85)."

Sometimes I still have brutal nightmares about the paranoia and crippling levels of fear it caused me. I just woke up from a horrific nightmare where I was at my boyfriends and the lamp in the room broke so it was dark and I was convinced the devil was trying to harm me. I was so terrified and running around and screaming. I mean just 10/10 terror. I woke up and felt so exhausted it was as though I hadn’t slept at all.

I have a girl crush on _PERSON_ (chelcie _NAME_). New guy I met seems admirable and gives a fu ck. I wonder if I’m smart enough to be his friend.ha ha ha I believe in the intelligence of the soul n spiri
t beyond brain smartness or education. Sometimes a friend can just think you are nice and that’s enough you don’t have to be intellectually compatible to be friends.i don’t think I believe in intelligence the way society does. When I was a child I loved _PERSON_ and how she stood up for women rights etc but in my old age I feel she has strict views she wants to force on me. _NAME_ the woman who made me and my mum vegan. She is someone I admire but I don’t agree with her in all regards. She is a anti vaccer and I’m not but I am against animal testing and the animals should atleast get care workers and doted on they need comfort after such trauma. I want to be a activist and admire those who are but with love not with hate. My x in sa has pain and difficulties and still does wonders. He and my former stepmother have given me kindness and understanding I think and not been hard on me. My parents could not understand me or love me as much as I wanted them to. There was a music teacher I met called djord
ge and I adored him and immediately idolised and loved him even though I only met him a few times. There was something magnificent about him. He was a mentor of a guy I was seeing. I can’t say more famous idols but when I’m in the same room as them I feel it immediately and I feel comfortable with them and full of love and admiration for who and all they are and sometimes what they do too. My mum didn’t want me to have idols but she wanted me to want high education and appreciate those who have it but I think it depends on the individual and their soul n spirit and all of who they are. I know I idolise some people that I can’t remember right now. Why can’t I remember them right now."

You really have to be into strategy games, though, and it's nothing like Fire Emblem Warriors, btw. I dislike Fire Emblem Warriors and games like that (e.g., Dragon Quest equivalent or Hyrule Warriors). I find those games kinda boring/dull/repetitive, but lots of people like them, so there is a market for them for sure. I recommend downloading a Fire Emblem demo from the eShop on your 3DS. The only difference between the Fire Emblems on the Switch and 3DS is that the characters are 3D renderings on the Switch, but 2D (""flat"") on the 3DS. Otherwise, they play the same (I'm assuming). What are AWESOME games are Dragon Quest Builders + Dragon Quest Builders 2. It's like Terraria, Minecraft, Starbound, etc. in the sense that you construct things out of blocks, only it has a great storyline. (I hate Minecraft, btw, so 
it's not quite the same.) I think Dragon Quest Builders has a demo, so you could try that too."

175954198,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Going Against the Grains: Gluten-Free Diets in Patients Without Celiac Disease-Worthwhile or Not? BA _PERSON_, PHR Green and B _PERSON_, Digestive diseases and sciences , May 2019 17 While the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only known effective therapy for celiac disease, in recent years it has become increasingly popular in the USA and worldwide, with many believing it to be more ""healthful"" and others claiming that it has beneficial effects for health conditions, many extraintestinal, other than celiac disease. This review examines the evidence for use of the GFD in patients without celiac disease who self-report intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms (non-celiac gluten sensitivity), as well as for enhancement of athletic performance and treatment of autism, rheumatoid arthritis, and psychiatric disorders. Overall, the evidence for use of GFDs in conditions other than celiac disease is poor. Though non-celiac gluten sensitivity may ultimately emerge as a biomarker-defined co
ndition, a large proportion of patients with apparent non-celiac gluten sensitivity have, after careful investigation, an alternative diagnosis. In light of this, and coupled with the potential physical and psychological harms associated with the avoidance of gluten, initiating a GFD should not be encouraged for people who have these other conditions or are seeking physical/athletic enhancement."

Anyway, all positive? That’s a bit of a loaded question, but essentially, yes. I have come to know myself, right down to the very core of my being. I have made me, the me, that I want to be. Either deliberately, or accidentally in conjunction with a neuological disorder. I’m truly just, truly happy and free of worry. And not manic, well not today anyway. My manics are amazing by-the-way. Imagine thinking that you hold the key to everyone who has ever been or will ever be’s, future happiness. And that said happiness is the only thing you really care about. Knowing that you are in a “block universe” regardless, so you cannot put a single foot wrong ever. If it works, it works, if it doesn’t, it always didn’t. The past, present and future all exist simutaniously, the flow of time is an illusion

A lot of times people will go thru several therapists before they find the right fit. I hope that doesn't happen in your case, but just remember if it does, you can always just walk out."

Doing things the ""adult"" way can be incredibly uncomfortable.

Believe I was suspended for a good amount of time for that. I was hospitalized late last year for homicidal thoughts. I checked myself in, because it had gotten to the point if I didnt I was dead set on doing it, and knew exactly how/whom it would be. Those extreme urges have passed, but I still get the fleeting urges I’ve had since childhood. Have always wanted to discuss this in therapy, but am scared of being hospitalized indefinitely.

174340892,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Facial Emotion Recognition and Persecutory Ideation in Paranoid Schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychological reports , May 2019 15 The recognition of facial signals has a crucial role in social interaction. It is well known that people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia have problems in the social domain, predominantly related to misinterpreting the intentions, emotions, and actions of others. The aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences in facial emotion recognition between people with paranoid schizophrenia and healthy controls. In addition, we examined the correlation between facial emotion recognition and the expression of persecutory ideation in people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. The study involved 60 participants, 30 of whom suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls, equalized by gender, age, and education. The following instruments were used: Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion 
and Neutral Faces and the Persecutory Ideation Questionnaire. Compared with the controls, people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia were significantly less accurate in recognizing the following emotions: surprise, contempt, sadness, disgust, and emotionally neutral faces. Since the attribution of emotions to emotionally neutral faces is an important finding that could be linked with the social (dis)functionality of people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, we analyzed and compared the wrong answers given by the two groups and found some differences between them. The results show that persecutory ideation has a statistically significant negative correlation with the successful recognition of emotionally neutral faces. All of the findings lead to the conclusion that paranoid schizophrenia, and within it the existence of persecutory ideation, leads to problems in recognizing the basic facial signals that form the foundation of everyday social interaction."

Sometimes it just helps to get your concerns expressed into a jumble of words so your mind can move along to something less troubling. 2) Asking for help - Post anything your heart desires.. questions, advice, your therapy advice for the week.. and others will chime in as best they can. 3) Helping others - Resolve problems you didn't even realize you had by using what you've learned to assist someone else with their questions that resonate well with you. It's sort of collaborative problem solving and thinking through related issues in a healthy way can better prepare you for that scenario if it ever happens to you in the future. ... and so on. There's many different parts to the website so keep coming back if something new crops up in your life. Each with their own subtle tips and tricks to a bette

175954475,"HI _PERSON_, My sober date is 6/23/2010, I have a sponsor and I have sponsored women. I previously worked as a Peer Engagement Specialist in the emergency dept (_NAME_). of my state's biggest hospital. I currently work as a Certified Peer Specialist for my state, working with clients who will eventually transition out of a State Psychiatric facility into the public with various levels of ongoing support. When I first got sober 9+ years ago, albeit long for this alcoholic but a short time for most, I remember taking a fellow AA member to _NAME_. His treatment was at best, fair. I saw the looks on the staff's faces as they came in to do what they had to do and could easily tell that they would have rather have been anywhere else. As a person who worked the steps I took it as a learning opportunity to humble myself to see the pain that some people carry regarding addicts. To see how it manifests in their behaviors. I wasn't happy about their treatment but I understood it. Even an alcoholic can get fru
strated at another alcoholic/addict when they don't seem to be ""getting it"". My time in the _NAME_ was a little different - 8 years later, the staff was somewhat softer to patients with SUD. I loved my time there because I got to be a part of the solution, helping addicts AND staff understand the helplessness and fear of addiction and sobriety. What I learned in the _NAME_ is that ALWAYS trauma goes hand-in-hand with addiction. It's very hard to behave in a way that is opposite of what your body is craving like air. Add to that a flooding back of all the feelings that initially disappeared when you were using. Many addicts would not even identify as having past trauma, to some degree neither did I but having some sober days under my belt and not giving up at just ""not drinking"" I was able to see the pain from the past that led me so easily to my addiction. There is a _USER_ID_, I believe, also combined with trauma, to a large degree. We, people with SUD, remind people of the traumas they experienced and t
hey see the alcohol or the drug and not the hurt that began the cycle of hiding real hurt. My frustration came when those that did not have the understanding because they were not addicts wanted to treat the SUD and not the trauma. I always told myself that I didn't get sober to be unhappy so I sallied forth but many people have no CLUE where to start. Life is harder as an addict but life FEELS harder without it and without a plan for learning how to overcome trauma."

174340908,"Hey all, So I was noticing lately that it required more labor for me to walk, I then began to get curious about antipsychotics and muscle weakness and it appears it can be a side effect. I haven’t been as physically capable as I was before antipsychotics but I guess it just took me 3 years to actually find out that is what it is. Back to the topic, I used to be pretty good at guitar but since going on meds I have had difficulty playing well and haven’t been doing it because it just isn’t the same. I think the increased difficulty in physically playing is part of it but I also don’t have the concentration due to schizophrenia giving me a more blank mind and also making it very hard to get in the zone musically. I can’t keep track of bars of music that I have played and can’t improvise or feel music the way I used to. Things are very different and it has made me pretty much give up on playing guitar or bass. So for me, guitar playing is very very diminished to the point that I don’t enj
oy it. I have just bought a digital piano/keyboard and am trying to substitute it as a hobby but am having the same issues of concentration and focus, it is more forgiving how I am playing it along to beats though, I can sort of get different grooves and patterns to go along with the beats but I still can’t keep track of what bar I am on.If anyone has similar issues I recommend playing keyboard along to beats, if nothing else . Music will always be probably my biggest hobby but it just isn’t the same, listening to music isn’t the same either but I can’t change how stuff is now I guess. Anyone else had some hobby affected by schizophrenia and/or meds?"

175954541,"_AT_MENTION_ you keep opening old threads. Please refer to our zombie threads rule. Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant.

I felt I was at the center of a giant play, and I was begrudgingly in the lead role…that satellite cameras were watching my every move…that I was making the whole world laugh and cry at the same time. My story is half comedic, half tragedy. I’ll write a book about it all some day…but nobody will believe any of it. It’s just too fantastical and unreal."
175954545,"Just a correction, Freemasons aren’t a conspiracy. They may have done some shady things in the past, but they are legit. I kinda want to look into them. And by the way I struggle with the same thing. My first post to this forum was actually a similar query. It was flagged and removed probably because it was too triggering. I wasn’t in a healthy place at the time. Wrong meds. I’m better now that I can counter my delusions with reason and logic. I don’t know what to say, maybe I believe this world is as it is, not what we wish it was, or what it should be. That being said, I believe 1984 is just a great, yet good (don’t get me wrong), book of fiction and society functions optimally when the patterns of life work together harmoniously. Thus the need for police, military, judges, government etc to ensure our good vibrations. I’m no cop licker but I do have respect for the folks who protect us and keep us safe. Crime is just bad, don’t care what it is. I think a lot of my personality just 
works to keep the peace. I feel fulfilled when everyone is okay, working together, and happy. And peaceful. fanning palm leaves of peace and calm here"

174340925,"I’m 31. I was put on disability when I was 19 and started getting paranoid and depressed and had to drop out of school and couldn’t keep a job. It got a lot worse in my 20’s but now I’ve been pretty stable for 4 years. Just not able to function in the world enough to get a job or go back to school. Yet, I hope. I am so sad all the time, I often feel like I’m going to cry and sometimes do. My anxiety is too high to take walks in my nice safe neighborhood. I used to be able to. I just started going in the backyard most days to get some time outdoors. I check my room often, especially under my bed, in case there is a person hiding under there. Sometimes even if I go downstairs for a moment and come right back upstairs. As if someone (or someones) have been waiting for their chance to hide under my bed. It’s so embarrassing and no one except my therapist. I mentioned it to her once and we talked about it for a few minutes. But it really bothers me and I would be really embarrassed if anyone 
knew. Like, that’s too classic ‘crazy.’ And there is a moment between thinking of checking and actually checking where I am terrified. And just assuming that someone who intends to harm me is hiding under my bed and steeling myself to look anyway. It is a really stressful moment that I have anywhere from 3-10? times per day and I could live without that. I worry on a daily basis about the possibility that someone may be monitoring my computer or phone use, or watching me or recording me with the cameras on them. I’m a disaster. I’ve almost all the medications, really. Some with really worrying and unmanageable side affects. And without the medication I do take I’m much, much worse, because I’m in some kind of actual fantasyland version of my life and manic at the same time. I have a lot of PTSD stuff from highly manic/psychotic episodes and the many hospitalizations that followed. If someone were in the exact same position as me, if someone else had written this post, I would feel extreme compas
sion for them, and hope that they get the help they need and not think badly of them at all. I am a kind person. But I hate myself. I’m just kind of horrified at how my life turned out. I want to learn to like myself sometimes. Feeling the way I do about myself and this constant worry about safety and strangers is too heavy on me. My memory is terrible now and it takes me longer to read books and I’m usually too stressed out to draw or sew or do anything I’m actually good at. I’ve read a little bit about Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, but I have had so much therapy, and been CBT’d with no results. I want to volunteer at the library or a friendly safe soup kitchen I can even walk to, but my anxiety about people other than my family is too high. What should I do? `Do I keep trying medications? There are basically only two left because I really don’t want to try them for various side effect reasons, Depakote and Clozapine. Have you gotten to a more okay place than this? If not, how are you dealin

175954563,"To be sincere, I have the same concern. However, I feel like my former self when I do or pursue the things I want or wanted previously. I used to work a lot, and for myself, build businesses, socialised, attended exclusive parties etc. And when I was diagnosed and told I could no longer do that. I died. I fell into a deep depression and had wanted to (use your imagination). I took a lot to rebuild myself and I am still rebuilding. I will also start therapy again as I still struggle with accepting myself. However, I went back into education, got a degree, currently finishing my masters and rebuilding my businesses. I find that just having direction helps. I exercise regularly, and maintain a lifestyle that is consistent with my needs and values. What that is will be different for everyone. For me was exercising my mind and being creative, therefore all of my pursuits were aligned with that."

That’s a gross distortion of the truth. She saw me as getting a lot of attention when in fact more often than not it was quite negative. There was certainly a degree of high expressed emotion going on from my parents.
175954588,Maybe I know a lot of people in the media say they were rejected 100’s of times before they became successful in whatever area they chose.

174340934,"Well, in the US at least, no positive symptoms means you don’t have schizophrenia. But it’s the psychosis that destroys grey matter, not negative symptoms. However, just because someone only displays negative symptoms at the time of diagnosis doesn’t mean that they’ll never develop positive symptoms. People diagnosed with schizophrenia simplex are also put on antipsychotics for that very reason. Just because psychotic symptoms are not observed doesn’t mean they aren’t there, no matter how mild they may be. I didn’t dismiss or downplay anything. I never even suggested that other illnesses and disabilities are less serious or severe. I said that autism, even severe autism, doesn’t destroy grey matter, which it doesn’t, therefore the two can’t be compared in this sense."

175954622,"I’m a 19 year old female who just started college for the first time this September. Now I’ll admit, I have felt easily overwhelmed by minor inconveniences & would needlessly worry about nothing 24/7 for a few years now, but I didn’t notice these problems until now because they weren’t interfering with daily life in the past. I straight up get TRIGGERED when someone mentions anything about school. I don’t like talking about my success and failures. I get so worked up over homework that I don’t do it (my procrastinating has reached its all time worst). I can relax but I will feel guilty about treating myself with TLC. Surprisingly, I don’t lose sleep over my stress and I have never experienced any sort of panic attack before. My mind’s always racing but you can’t tell from looking at me. I have a very hard time remembering and following through with simple directions. My family will often tell me to get a grip and stop acting _USER_ID_; like I know they mean well, but damn! I feel 
like I was born stupid. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m also worried that I’m slowly turning into a hypochondriac because I can relate to a lot of the symptoms found in Anxiety, but I’m trying to not assume anything because self-diagnosing is a terrible idea. Maybe I’m not “suffering enough” to have a disorder. TL;DR Am I showing signs of anything possibly serious? Or am I just disorganized and looking for an excuse or something? Can you have anxiety even if you don’t suffer from insomnia & panic attacks?"

174340940,"I believe in gradual weight loss. Can’t find any evidence for it, but there’s lots of evidence that rapid weight loss usually leads to putting it all back on and some. That’s been my experience too when I have been psychotic and refusing to eat. I avoid “diets” and only make changes I can see myself sticking with for the rest of my life. So I’ve just gradually cut down my eating in a way that I think I can sustain for the rest of my life. I’ve been doing it for 4 years and in that time I’ve lost 16kg (35 pounds). That included putting on 7kg giving up smoking and getting it off again. I know that’s slow, but hey if I hadn’t done it I probably would have put on 16kg, so really I’ve lost 32kg. I’m now out of the morbid obese category and just obese, which makes me happy. I’ve had to struggle with hunger from the amisulparide. If I eat to my appetite I’m putting on weight. So I tried to stick to around 1800 cal a day - I just counted occasionaly, saw how hungry I was and tr
ied to be roughly that hungry most days. Now I’ve changed to Abilify I can eat that without feeling hungry, so I find it easy to maintain weight or lose a little compared to before. Since I’ve added exercise, I haven’t lost much on the scales, but I’ve gone down a dress size. I weigh most days, and my weight fluctuates like the stock market, but keeping it in an app means you can see the long term trend."
175954639,Perhaps to you but to others you may be hitting certain flags. Psychiatry really is an art especially when it comes to meds and time constraints. It’s not unusual to think your sane around here when your out with the fairies. Believing in things that aren’t real to most is pretty well a delusion is it not? Yeah you can argue semantics but I’d suspect it boils down to medication. You come unstuck off medication then it’s a moot point anyways. Most folks around here need meds for life in our current medical tech.
175954640,I would ask a pharmacist. They know drugs better than anyone
175954641,"no, keto isn’t for me. The last 2 days of my diet have been totally awful, I’ve eaten 1500 calories both days instead of 1200 calories. So no weight loss. But I’ll do good today.

175954646,"Citymouse , what are you own answers to those questions? For me: I definitely care about things, but I can't tell whether my internal experience of caring is the same as other peoples. Certainly there are lots of times other people seem to be feeling a much wider range of more intensive emotions than I feel. I care a lot about truth. It makes me angry when people don't care what is and isn't true, or when they conceal information because it is easier than being honest. I care a lot about people in a collective sense. I care about things being fair. I have strong left-leaning political opinions. I have very little interest in most people. Very few people are reliably interesting enough to be worth the effort it takes to engage with them. I don't understand why I am expected to care about Person X just because they are related to person Y who is a friend of the person I'm currently talking to. Even if Person X was in a car crash, why should I care? I already know that car crashes happen to people. It 
isn't information. It isn't something I'm able to do something about. I'd much rather have a conversation about how to prevent car crashes generally than hear how this one has personally affected someone I don't know. There are a small number of people that I care a lot about. I want them to like me, and if they don't, even temporarily, I find that quite difficult. The number of people this applies to is much smaller than the number of people I am socially supposed to care a lot about. Even with them, I'm still not sure I feel as strongly as most people do. Either that, or people exaggerate a lot, constantly, about how they feel. I'm not sure I've ever wanted to hug someone. I've learned the behaviour, but it took a lot of practice. I don't know if I care about myself. I'm not sure what that means. I care about achieving things, particularly my academic writing. I don't enjoy getting physically hurt. I get annoyed at myself - does that count?"
175954647,"Okay, so I left work at 6am this morning, like i do every morning, and I went to go shop for groceries at the store. I'm looking all about, and I don't buy much. I buy a few gallons of water for the birds and the lizard. They can't have tap water. I saw a post about bar soap being better than body wash, and like a heathen, I hissed at the bar soap and foamed at the mouth while quickly grabbing my body wash. I'm good on shampoo though. I use girly girl shampoo because I like smelling pretty. So that was the first aisle. The next aisle I went to was the cereal aisle. I like cereal, but I don't like the price of cereal. I go immediately to the discount section they have at the end of each aisle, for the products in that aisle. I found a few things. A box of Sour Patch Kids cereal, and I love Sour Patch Kids candy. The cereal tastes exactly like it. Thank god I only paid 76 cents for it, because two bites in, the bowl and the box went in the trash. There's no need a cereal to be sour. The other cereal 
I got were pop tart cereal. Strawberry, Cookie and Cream, and Cinnamon brown whatever. I tried the cookie and cream one and it was delicious. I imagine the other two are too, but that's for another time. I got some eggs and also made egg salad. I'll take a couple sandwiches with me to work each night until I run out. A nice, quick lunch, more time to enjoy a book on my phone through the Kindle app. Yes yes. It's just before 7:30am here. The birds will be waking soon. I got them some new perches to stand on, made of hard wood and concrete. These are to trim their nails so neither I nor the vet have to do so. It happens naturally. Yes yes. I got some more green tea. I've been wanting to try _NAME_ Grey for a while, but again, I got _PERSON_ Green tea. I don't drink it very often, usually on a day off. It relaxes me. My primary care doctor is all, ""that's got caffeine in it!"" and I'm all, ""whoa, dude, no way!"" It's why I only drink it during a day off though. I guess I could start drinking it at work. Maybe 
I'll try that tonight. Yes yes. I went to the CD section to laugh. It's a smaller than small section, like, maybe ten CD's to choose from. I listen to vinyl or I stream music off my phone, but if they had a good CD, I wouldn't have been opposed to buying it. They didn't though. It was the first time since, like, 1999 that I saw a Backstreet Boys CD though. I scowled at the sight of it, but I walked away and went into the book section, also known as the literary porn section for middle aged and elderly women. They had a _NAME_ Grisham book there. I read three of the man's books, and tried to read a few others. The man isn't that great of a writer in my opinion. He can't write a likable character to save his life. I hated every single person in the three I read. I read the Rainmaker, I think it was called, the one where the attorney is trying to get his racist uncle out of the gas chamber, which was the worst of the three (but by far the longest), and The King of Torts, which was doom and gloom for the main cha
racter, until all his problems went away conveniently like they never existed. _PERSON_ not a good writer, I'm sorry, I've never thought he was. Everyone says, ""Oh, A Time to Kill is so great!"" and yeah, it might be, but he has like, twenty-five books after that, AT LEAST. It was his first book, but my god, I tried to read about eight of his books and they were all awful because of the terrible characters and just boring and uninteresting drama. I can get behind modern day writers, I can, but the writers that have their works being sold at grocery stores that are stocked by a vendor are terrible ninety-nine out of a hundred times. The last time I bought a book at that store that wasn't complete shiitake mushrooms was The Hunger Games. I thoroughly enjoyed that book, and I read it in like, two days. Then I went and bought the second and third, and I got about a third of the way through the second and said, ""well, this is disappointing..."" and I stopped. I used to be a Barnes and Noble frequenter many moons 
ago, and the last book I got from there was _NAME_: Vampire Hunter. I was at the store with my homie G, and I saw that and was all ""wow, seriously?"" and he told me that it was actually a really good book, and it is. I'd recommend it highly. The beginning is a little slow, but it gets going early and never stops. It's a wild and exciting ride. With my kindle e-reader, and the fact that I own about twenty trillion leather bound collectible books from the _NAME_ Library or some other big name library, I don't go to Barnes and Noble that much anymore. In fact, I can't tell you the last time I did go there. I think it was with My Home Dawg, and that was, like, I don't know, 2013? Their book selection is top of the line, but everything else is bewilderingly overpriced, but they're known for that though. I used to think, ""I'd like to work here!"" and the same day I gave the manager my application (that's how long ago it was, I used a paper application), I walked around, and heard two people ask really stupid ques
tions to an employee. ""I'm looking for a book that's written like a _PERSON_ book, but I'd like it to be historical fiction,"" was one. I remember giving that guy a weird look when he asked the woman that. To me, that's like, just, I-I don't even know. That's a, ""Oh, let me go ask a manager!"" question, where you say that and then go hide into the backroom and look busy. The other question was, ""Do you have any _NAME_?"" and my immediate response in my head was, ""NO! _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ has NOTHING like that, OBVIOUSLY! Why would you think we did? What are you, stupid?!"" Thankfully, they never called. Also, their tablets/e-readers are garbage. _USER_ID_: If you want an e-reader, either download the Kindle app for your smartphone or get a Kindle E-reader. They're great. Except I hear the new $130 one has an atrocious battery life that ruins it. Get the $80 one though, so long you just want to read. It doesn't play audio and it's really weird, and in terms of specs, it's low quality, but you're obviously 
not going to be streaming videos on it, you're going to be reading. It does the job. I saw the Kindle Oasis yesterday at its staggering $300 price tag, and for that much, it better be an actual tablet and not just an e-reader. Yes yes."

But the world isn’t always that chaotic if civilizations exist historically, and people’s family lives continue normally. There is an unusual belief that some people are always upset like Schizophrenia is some sort of sublimated lazyness. It’s difficult to sleep at night if everybody had a divorce.

I have had the same issues like you do. A lot of times you just have to not think the worst. I always thought the worst but honestly, it never happened. So I worried over nothing. That is precious time I lost worrying. Time I could have spent with my mom (who has passed away now) time I could have spent with my babies (they are all grown now) time I could have had fun with my friend and family. You are 17, I am 52. Don’t make my mistake. Don’t let that anxiety rule over you. Go out and live life. Enjoy it to the fullest. Laugh a lot, smile. If you don’t have friends, then be friendly. Look for someone to be friends with. Join a club, attend a church and get to know Jesus, start jogging daily, don’t eat junk food. Drink lots of lwater, learn to play the piano or a guitar, It is my hopes and prayers that you go forward towards a wonde
rful life. I have been in your shoes. I still am. But I’ve learned to ride out the symptoms, not jump to the worst, I even have called my nurse practitioner and he’s helped alleviate my fears. I hope this helps you some. Best wishes to you and I’ll pray for you."

I will give you a concrete example. Two families do not live in the same house or plough the same fields all the time, two people do not occupy the same space. This is what I mean by division and natural order, numbers, perception of what is and what isn’t, distinction, and difference. As another example one woman’s husband is not another’s, one woman’s child is not another’s, families are partially ordered, not linearly and indeed beyond the single partially ordered tree is a whole forest. Divisions is a part of life, it is used for calculating things, working through problems, until they are resolved. So long as we perceive, it cannot be avoided. Should everyone share the same house or are they entitled to separate houses. P
roperty is theft according to _PERSON_, but private property is a right. I am not trying to be political, I am trying to point out the nature of politics. Homosexuality didn’t even cross my mind when I spoke of a natural order, it is a part of life as well, and stating that division is necessary is a simple fact of respecting the private property of others, since to observe is to collapse the wave function."

I believe Lithium is relatively weight neutral. The only thing it really does for me is make me more thirsty and want to drink more water, which I do. As far as mood stabilizers go, Lithium is the best out there, for its minimal side effect profile and also its ability to increase grey matter in the brain, reversing the damage episodes cause. Lithium is good for neural plasticity. Lithium prevents both the highs and the lows. If there is such thing as a “wonder drug”, then Lithium is it."

They aren't big windows so it isn't much of a problem. I do like them better than curtains though. Mine desperately need to be cleaned. Not fun. I hope you are having a good week too. Sunny here today and not as cold as yesterday. We had cold wind for a couple of days. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175954733,I totally agree with you. I wish I didn’t have to sleep and could do all this things. But it’s for the best to sleep. I know I wouldn’t be well if I stayed up all night.

I hope you treat yourself out for your birthday by getting some ice cream and going out to a park lol.

175954740,"Hey there, I have pretty bad health anxiety and feel like every day it's something new with me. The constant news and media reporting on coronavirus has obviously gotten me feeling a lot more anxious than usual. I live here in California, a place I feel is quickly becoming a hot spot. I'm conscious of the fact that the chances of contracting it (currently) are very low given I haven't traveled or come in contact with any known cases. But alas, the fear persists. Every time I cough or feel a scratch in my throat, I think the worst is around the corner. I work from home but do go out and about socially, while practicing exceptional/likely obsessive hygiene. However, I just can't shake the anxiety. Anyone else feels this way or have insight into things to tell someone in my position. It should be noted I take immunosuppressives for a separate condition--which has only heightened my worry that it will choose me. Thanks."

I remember i was so surprised by it, i thought it was so cool that you could just steal whatever car you wanted lol. I was like 9 or 11 years old. After that i didnt play it for many years so i never played Vice City (even though I think I might have it) until a friend had San _NAME_ and I got into it again. So i played SA, then i played IV and V (was so obsessed with V and after finishing the story mode i got really into the online multiplayer) and i'm definitely waiting to play the next one that will come out."

175954745,"I’m sorry you’re going through all that! I also suffer from depression, anxiety, and insomnia so I understand where you’re coming from and I know how hard it can feel, but hang in there! Have you thought about seeing a doctor or psychiatrist to get sleeping medication? It may not be an ideal treatment but it might help you get onto a better sleep schedule. I always watch one of my favorite adult animation shows (i.e. Bobs Burgers, etc.) during the night on my laptop, it helps keep part of brain distracted so I get lost in endless thoughts less. It doesn’t work for everyone but it might be worth a try! You could also try adding meditation to your daily routine. It can be hard to get into, admittedly. But lots of people says it works great for all the issues you’ve been having! I know that suggestions aren’t always helpful and you just need someone to listen and understand how you’re feeling, so I hope this post helped a little! A lot of us are in the same boat!

When I feel like that it helps if I can talk openly with someone and trust that they won't judge or question my feelings and not try to fix them either. Just offload the emotions and figure out the next step forward. Also, the pain could be from built up tension if he is bottling everything up."

I had a lard, rubbery/hard round cyst that turned out to be 100 percent benign. I have had them come and go since and they no longer alarm me. ;) S.C."

Right now I'm doing verryy good. Was anxious an hour ago but it went away. I've been feeling good all day today - Got some reading done... I think it's cuz I'm organized and chose to stop wasting time. All of my meds and drugs are organized ^.; I cleaned my computer, phone and tablet with hand sanitizer.

175954776,Thanks VioMin. Anyone that is interested feel free to post here. I recommend keeping your responses anonymous as we usually do here on the forums. _NAME_
174341013,I am late posting about your diagnosis. It did throw me for a loop when I got the diagnosis after being diagnosed with bipolar I for a while. It was discouraging for me. I have had the diagnosis for a long time. My schizoprenia part of me is worsening in a strange way. I have negative symptoms of it. But one thing I am very grateful for is my meds and I never get tempted to get off of them. The price would be too high for me. You can and will get better but you DO HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF all the time to make sure you get the right treatment. I am doing much better over the years. You also need therapy and as many support systems tthat you can get.
175954777,"I wished upon a shooting star when I was a kid and ""Make me a millionaire!"" was what came to my mind.. Just a funny thing. Now I wish I could take that back and wish for my mom to beat cancer or something like that. I got into school early when I was a kid because I could divide and multiply at age 4. Did very good in math in school and then I hit my head? I was an atheist and nihilistic.. Until I tripped.. If I wasn't so mentally ill and didn't get dealt such a bad card in life, Idk where I'd be. I had an online friend that was a millionaire from selling drugs on the dark web. He abused coke and said ""I won"" or something like that. I tried to help him quit. He just was never happy. I know money doesn't make people happy - But it helps. He was a real autistic savant. I think spirituality is very important.. A lot of people are all about success and chasing a high but never can look inwards into themselves. People fear death, other people and/or themselves. That's what causes addiction to drugs, 
distractions, growth, etc. I don't know what I want because I haven't thought about it yet. I have cognitive impairment now. I'm unlikely to become a millionaire because it takes a lot of work unless it's luck. I just want a good life experience and for people to not suffer. Idk.. It's life. It is what it is ^-;"

But I suppose I shouldn’t complain. I won the geographic lottery being born in Canada."
175954779,"I have inner dialogues, but not monologues. My thoughts are abstract and condensed, I suspect most people think like this. When problem solving, planning or working out issues related to creative projects, I often slow down my thoughts into proper sentences in order to remember or make something stick. As far as inner dialogues go, it's hard to explain. It's something like acknowledging the different parts of my consciousness and assigning each of them different voices, but not in a literal sense: it's my head, I know who's talking. *The voice in my head that knows the right thing to do but always chooses otherwise. *The voice in my head that knows the correct course of action but is rarely given priority. *The angry, petulant child who I occasionally allow to babble unchecked because it makes me feel better. *The voice of reason who tries to get everyone else to work together or at least slow down, consider things, and act appropriately. They're always bickering. It's when two or more of them come 
to an agreement that I can get things done. I also suspect I have a kind of inner idiot savant who ignores everything but and keeps a kind of running tab on (mostly) external matters, but that's something different."

175954783,"The dark side. I've watched episodes about it as well.. I won't go into detail cuz you know.. But we all love you and don't want this to happen to you or anyone else.. Most times, I think that I'm over addiction.. I mostly am. I mean, who goes into a years long drug mania and then recovers so well? There's so many people that are overdosing more than ever and the same is with eating disorders - Cuz of the pandemic. So many things like this are caused by stress. 90% of my addiction is better. I still dabble in a few soft drugs.. Basically, the baseline for us is like normal life. So don't think of it as going back into the black hole. Why? Because you've been there already. It's not like the first time. And for me, if I got rewarded chemically.. It's much worse for you because it's the opposite - Motivated by feeling bad and culture.. It's all very complicated. If I was educated on English grammar or scientific research, I'd write books, blogs, etc.. It's all trying to understand certain things and 
we learn from each other - Support is key.. I know that you're over it and it's tempting but the temptation doesn't last. Be resilient during those times =]"
175954784,"By accidently, I ended up losing like 20lbs, While taking 100mgs of Seroquel, because I started the chip diet lol. Basically, all I'd eat is chips with 3 beers to keep my anxiety down and save money. Otherwise, I'd spend $30 bucks on lunch EVERY SINGLE lunch, and spend 200 a week just on lunches because I'd always order 2 tall beers. But now that im on payroll, my taxes are taken out automatically. Thank god for my boss doing that. It's nice to not have to worry about taxes in the middle of the winter. I shouldn't drink beer at work, I know, but It's nice to look forward to something in the middle of the day to feel a little emotion and to take away anxiety and depressing thoughts. I don't drink otherwise except when I write on the weekends."

So you just pick three activities, one each for a different sense. Example ....I like animals so I might visit a zoo and take photos while enjoying a snack or drink, three fun things at once. It amplifies the experience the more you do at once. You might like biking, Some music and one more thing....maybe you’d like to take photos too? Idk but you can pick scented candles or other scent, taste, etc but you need to do at least three things at once. If you can afford it you can also buy something new that’s small, a scented soap, a new type of drink(mocktail)? Maybe cooking a new item is fun for you? Bake some cupcakes while calling a friend and enjoy both the smell and taste and sound. Touch is the most difficult if your alone so break out a squeazy ball or a fidget spinner.

My room is a whole different place since the first roommate was gone to the hospital (or so they said). It sounds mean but it feels free in here now. My second roommate has been talking almost non stop, too, so I think she feels the same way. Got new juice and a battery charger yesterday. The juice is my customary 12mg nic but the kick it has is deadly. I'm not sure why. It's a thin juice, at least 50/50. Oh well. I want to go back and see everything myself.

175954832,"HI JRF007, I am sorry for what you are going through. Do you do any breathing exercises? Because they can really help with high anxiety. I use to skip months at a time. Finally I went on birth control and it helped keep me regular. Stress can cause ailments. It messes with my blood sugars. Stress is an unwanted visitor. I think once you figure out if you are pregnant or not you should talk to your doctor about options. With birth control (if you are interested) and anti anxiety or anti depressant medications. I think by taking control, you will be a lot less anxious. I hope you feel better soon. Take things one day at a time... _PERSON_, _NAME_..."

175954843,"Maybe not that one belief, but I guarantee that you have an emotional connection to some belief. It makes them feel better because it makes them part of a social group. Yes. And that psychological need is ""social belonging"". The truth is what your group (or its leaders or enforcers) say the truth is. Why? Because it makes you part of the group. Well, it's messed up, but it's how the species works as a rule. Note that it is considered a disorder when the kind of truth being argued is ""inconsistent with cultural or subcultural norms"". Again, because it's the goal of social belonging (and only the goal of social belonging) that makes it normal. Ask _PERSON_. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8 That's a well-educated modern-day image of someone looking at the moon and crapping their pants. It's fun to think about these things and discuss them and all, but if you're not thinking about it just because it's fun and interesting, then you're getting into belief territory. It's almost comically c
ircular reasoning, and it fundamentally relies on the HUGE assumption that the causation of consciousness can be probabilistically analyzed. It's an entirely arbitrary and unfalsifiable assumption, and there's no scientific indication at all that it's the case (or that it isn't, for that matter). We have no idea what consciousness is, and chances are we'll never know. For all I know, there's no ""we"" to begin with, and I am the only conscious thing that exists. Or maybe the table, the floor and everything else is conscious. One statement is as logically meaningless as the other anyway, when there's no way to even begin to objectively define what consciousness is. _PERSON_ is a smart guy. He knows all this. And, unlike people like Bostrom, he's not a philosopher or a theorist of any kind. He's actually pretty busy with real-world stuff. So why is he fixated on that sort of idea anyway? Do you see my point? Even that, I still think it's down to group cohesion / loyalty / membership. People will sometimes be le
ss afraid of death than they are afraid of ostracism, and they'll act accordingly. I meant that it's not a good idea to carelessly disparage fundamentalists. They make no sense, they're no good, but underestimating their capabilities has the same effect as overestimating their threat: they gain strength. Recent events and current global trends reflect that. I don't know. That's a mystery to me too. There was a period of a few years when I still went to church voluntarily. I thought ""one day I'll understand"". One day I did. So I stopped going. It's expected from kids that they'll outgrow it, and there'll be no negative consequences when they call the adults out on the BS. The same can't be said for religious precepts. Other than that, yes, it's the same. My father went to priest school. He reads the bible every day. If you ask him if the _NAME_ story really happened, he'll say ""Of course not, that's crazy. It's just allegory."" When I tell him about some evidence of mistranslation or misinterpretation or su
spiciously selective editing of Bible passages introduced centuries after original authorship, he loves to hear about it and then go see it for himself. Some people are not as sensible when it comes to those things though. Some communities are not as sensible. So, yes, people will go ""la la la"" for the sake of conformity. Also, think about it. Displaying belief in something obvious and reasonable proves nothing in particular about you. But displaying belief in something arbitrary and unreasonable proves loyalty / submission / conformity. So that's what's demanded . With time, people internalize it (to varying degrees). Questioning the belief becomes mentally indistinguishable from questioning the whole social network that they're often reliant on. It literally overrides logic. That's religion in a nutshell."
175954844,"I kinda feel better today in a sense. In another sense, I don't feel so good. I did start the Abilify again this morning, so maybe it's because of that - the reason that I feel slightly better. I guess I'm just coming to terms with the way things have been for a while. Like the past year or so. I wish I felt better."

175954849,"Update: Hello again, I thought of sharing a quick update on the situation, maybe someone will benefit from reading and won't be as confused as I was/still am actually. I never texted him to meet even though we agreed upon that. Basically, I didn't do anything anymore and left him on his own. Weeks later, he uploaded pictures on his social media with a girl whom I know he used to date. I was crushed, but didn't do anything again. He checked my social media very regularly and after two months of silence, last week, he texted me out of the blue, asking me how I was and that he wanted to meet me (in a bar..). One of his messages informed me that he might be getting into another hypomanic episode. What is more, the same day I uploaded some photos on Instagram with another guy, which he liked and then texted me hours later. I think that was the real reason behind him reaching out. At first I was cold and replied with very short messages. Then I said I will think about it and if I have some time I will te
xt him to hang out (his words: hang out). Yesterday evening I contacted him and asked very warmly of his plans on that particular day, with the idea to meet him. He still hasn't replied although he was online. And that's it. I don't think I can take this behavior anymore. Even if he replies I probably won't agree to meet him or whatever. I hope this story can help someone, as the numerous cases I read online have somehow helped me."

175954886,"_AT_MENTION_, The fact that you appreciate the good will behind and the truth in what you heard is wonderful. I admire your mindset, and it will serve you well. Many of the people I've met in life would have reacted badly in your shoes. Many of the people I've met in life are messed-up. That said, it sounds like people in your workplace have WAY too much free time on their hands. Having worked, at one extreme, in state jobs where many had ""make work"" positions in which they did, literally, nothing besides scan the internet, and, at the other extreme, in aerospace, where there was an unspoken rule that no one took vacation unless instructed to, and where, literally, once-mandatory overtime got curtailed only because an employee had a heart attack while getting ready for work, I have to say that:"

The MP3 that I linked on YouTube is very nice, but it makes her voice sound so much heavier than what it really was. Her register, for a lack of a better term, is dark, and it was always dark, but he voice sounds less heavy on vinyl."

175954891,"I absolutely can. You might consider trying organic raw cacao nibs. Relatively expensive but you won't need much. Expect to feel like a termite chewing on bitter wood chips and you won't be disappointed, but two or three carefully-timed mounds each the size of a quarter give me superhuman energy and endurance. If I go overboard (as I am wont to do), I can get heart palpitations and have to ""come down"" by eating four slices of quality cheddar cheese, but they don't do a number on me like coke or even speed (which used to be my friend). If these work for you, you will need to brush your teeth before meeting clients, lest your grin reveal hunks of black stuff between your teeth. TMI, but I like to let people know what they're getting into. Good luck."

175954904,"_NAME_ said... You say, ""Every night, even if i elevate my head, i feel a discomfort, a weight in my chest/belly, even if i do stretching, yoga, eat well.."" I have chest discomfort, also, and find that a heating pad helps that. It enlarges the blood vessels and rushes more oxygen and nutrients to the injured area. Do you have a heating pad? I keep mine plugged into the wall by my bed. When I was about 28, I was out of a job, away from people, in my apartment by myself and was getting in such by shape nerve-wise, I knew I should see a psychiatrist. I was the youngest child and never had learned to solve my own problems, always counting on my older siblings and my parents. But now here I was living by myself and having big problems and I didn't know what to do. I knew what to do, but I couldn't do it. My negativity was coming home to roost. It got worse and I finally got to a psychiatrist. Turned out I was bipolar. Turned out my mother's mother was bipolar, so I inherited that, because it can skip 
a generation (my mother didn't have it). In my mother's mother time, 1930's, 40's, they didn't have any medicines for emotional problems, and she spent some years in a state mental hospital 100 miles from home. Today, and for the last 50 years and more, they have many very effective medicines. So I've seen, or heard about, a lot of change. As a bipolar, I'm on Lithium for my mania and Mirtazapine for my depression. And it has been really helpful for the past many years. Have you ever considered going to a psychiatrist? thanks for the message the thing is, i would like to try to heal the physical problem, before eventually considering going to a psychiatrist. Unless, perhaps, it's something in my mind that is provoking this. But i'm super wary of taking any psy medicine, don't want to rely on this."
175954905,"Hi guys. Still doing bad today. My parents offered last night to delay their trip to my sister's because I am struggling but I didn't want them to do that. So I told them to go ahead and go. I did call up a friend and ask her if I could come to her place if I start feeling too unwell. She has her sister staying with her right now but she said she has an extra bed if I need to sleep over and I can come anytime. I want to SH so bad! I texted my T but she didn't get back to me. I emailed my former Pastor _PERSON_ and he sent me back a lovely, loving, sweet email telling me that runners hit a wall and then they have to push through the wall and push through their pain to get through it and that's where I am at. He also said he believes in me. I see T tomorrow. I'm kind of scared I'll be hospitalized. I know I will be if I act on any SH so I'm trying not to. Voices and visions have been good.

175954913,"Hello, I read your post, and I can relate to the depression and anxiety. Especially when you said you tend to blame yourself for everything. I use to do that for the longest time, and I recently started to walk out of it. It's hard because it's like a spiral effect and trying to find your way out of it is like a needle in a haystack. Aside from this forum, have you had any luck with a therapist? I have never had a consultation, but I am thinking about it. I feel like I would have a hard time opening up to a stranger. What are your thoughts?"

175954917,"Of course it's better when you're with people - because when you're interacting with them, you don't have as much time to ""talk to yourself"", and you can FEEL the reality of the situation. When you're by yourself, you start telling yourself all sorts of ""lies"", and you believe these pop-up random thoughts to be true. Remember to tell yourself that when you're with people, that is REALITY. When you're by yourself, try reminding yourself that the thoughts that are ""coming to you"" are not REAL, but are actually ""stories"" that you are inadvertently telling yourself. It might take time for you to eventually remember this, but if you tell yourself this EACH time, you will be able to stop yourself sooner before you begin to spiral out. Keep with the CBT - it's supposed to be very helpful for anxiety. Also, I believe it seems to be more apparent in the AMs because you are probably more by yourself then; and, at least for me, there seems to be a connection to AM time and low blood sugar, which can e
xacerbate the jittery feelings. In the evenings, you are probably more tired, so your mind just wants to zone out more rather than start up ""worried"" thoughts. Hope some of this insight helps."

I left a message, and will let everyone know what they said should they call me back. Thanks for the nudge. Two adult foxes and four babies living nearby. Oh, gosh. I guess only people who've had foxes in their backyard or nearby can understand this, so again, I appreciate the tip. Also, sorry to hear about your dog getting torn up by the foxes.

175954933,"Hi everyone. Like many others I’m sure, I’m struggling with the uncertainty and unknowns of this virus. I’m early 30s and pretty healthy. I’m worried because I’ve had this cough since getting over phnemonia in December and I’m having testing done for my dr is fully aware and ain’t overly concerned but of course my anxiety doesn’t realize that. In addition, everything is closing and I’m worried about my parents who are in their sixties. My dads retired but my mom works hourly and doesn’t get paid if she doesn’t work-she works in a school cafeteria (schools closed) but they are delivering meals to students in need at their homes or bus stops. The worry is causing me to feel like I can’t take in enough breath..I don’t have a fever and my cough has been going on for months and my dr wasn’t concerned to give me a flu or covid-19 test. I’m just in full worry mode. Who else is feeling this way? Anyone? Feeling scared and anxious and I don’t see it ending anytime soon.."
175954934,I think my doctor is going to be mad at me. He’s being used as a pawn. I don’t blame him at all. He’s too nice of a guy. He wouldn’t hurt me. Forced to peddle poison. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

175954946,"Hello, I am new to this support group and frankly feel nervous about posting, but I am doing it anyway. I have OCD, anxiety and maybe mild depression. My doctor put me back on Sertraline (50mg); this is my third week on it. Some days I feel like I am getting better; other not. I am still feeling nervous/anxious. I know an antidepressant takes time to really kick in. But sometimes I feel like it is going to be forever until I feel better. Has anyone experienced the same side effect?"
175954947,Yes my sister recently and idk probably other stuff I shouldn’t be stressed about. I’m also stressed about the state of my mental health right now too. And other minor things. I stress out easily. Even on the littlest things. So big things kill me inside.
175954948,"Hmmm. Seems the analysis is more on the side of milder depression- the placebo effect and data collated. This would make sense, but i get that only via this can consumers be correctly informed. Big pharmaceutical...dont get me started!!! Well done to the peeps who pushed it. Great post. Stick it in depression forum as well. Great research by ya. My head not up for it much these days. HT"
175954949,"I feel about my family the same way I feel about the majority of other people - meh. Yes, they've done some really @!@@@! up stuff to me, and forever altered my brain. But I don't really hold it against them all that much because that would require a level of emotion towards another human being that I'm really not capable of. We have a superficial relationship now, and that's fine. They're never going to admit how much their actions impacted me, they just go to a place of denial or gaslighting. Physical affection from either makes me very, very uncomfortable though. My extended family I have absolutely no feelings towards or about. They might as well be strangers."

175954951,No high blood pressure so far. It's 9pm. I have 3 more hours until I sleep (12am). High blood pressure could show up but unlikely cuz I didn't drink an energy drink today. Maybe I can get away with taking 10mg melatonin and 50mg seroquel. That's the plan (Not to use benzos).... Then tomorrow I'm taking 900mg phenibut.. (I can be smart cookie sometimes)
175954952,"So far, so good."
175954953,"I should have just taken one ativan and not the xanax too cuz I immediately felt no energy and just went to bed, started thought hallucinating and went to sleep.

I just painted a field of dandelion puffballs so art check. I haven’t really cooked in so long....not my kitchen so there’s competition lol....still think it’s a great idea. Maybe I’ll look for a new recipe. For me it’s the exploration of new things that makes me most happy.

175954958,Zopiclone is a brilliant sleep med. I took a full one every night for a month and then took half for 5 nights and still was able to sleep. I only fall asleep when it kicks in though. I'm blessed with being able to have such a good sleep. Will take a full one tonight cuz kinda overwhelmed about getting up early for work.

175954969,"This is admirable, even more from your part. _PERSON_, I remind that you killed your teacher's cat because she told you were wrong. Btw I agree with _PERSON_ that it's not a right/wrong question. I think that... maybe everyone is right, when he thinks that he is right, and we all are right, it's just that our needs and PoV are conflicting. As you story about perception showed. We haven't to judge others, and we haven't to judge ourselves. The point is understanding deeply our pov and others' pov, and then find a way to conciliate and synthesize them, discovering a solution that is good for everyone. I guess that I like a lot the Game Theory by Nash, do you know? ""The best choice for someone is the choice offering the best result for himself AND for the group"". I would like to deepen it. Yes _AT_MENTION_ I like the quote me too"
175954970,"My prior response didn't take this into account. I think hallucinations are real experiences, don't get me wrong. They are totally real and valid to the person experiencing them. Oh, and also there's a theory in philosophy called the brain in a vat hypothesis (BIVH for short). Basically it explains a form of skepticism towards reality. The argument generally tries to prove that if we don't know we're not brains in vats, then we should be skeptical about reality. That's a huge aside, but I thought it could be interesting to some people... I don't know if that's related at all to this thread, in all honesty. But I decided to say something about it since it's interesting to me. I guess it is related to hallucinations because we could think of hallucinations as things that lack validity. But if we're brains in vats, then we wouldn't know whether hallucinations were real or not. I think I'm confusing myself here..."
175954971,I wonder if mood stabilizers will help you?
175954972,"Yeah, I am talking to the doctor on Tuesday. I think I know what to tell her. Just that the Klonopin was destroying me."

174341271,"I've been on a psychiatric medication called Clozaril since 2011. It's the only medication that I've been taking since 2011. I was a little bit worried about taking the Clozaril at first, as I was afraid that my issues with excessive anxiety would return. Bad anxieties were a real problem for me between 2001-2008. But after a while, it became clear to me that the Clozaril was working well for me. It still is. I feel happy and calm and have felt that way since going on the Clozaril."

In my hyperfocus yesterday I signed up for it! I regret that I didn't do it three years ago missing out on all the profit. On one hand, maybe it's not very smart to put more money into other things while I still have debt, but I'm trying to be smart and invest. I wish I had more money to invest and pay off debt."
175954976,So you’ve written bye bye meds in your signature....for me meds were the only thing that worked long term for voices....singing worked short term as did any sort of complex mental manipulation like picturing 3D images moving like radar screens or coins spinning.
174341289,"I said on the chat that I bought supplements on Amazon to help increase dopamine and someone said ""Did you ask your doctor? High dopamine can cause psychosis"" and I said ""I don't believe my schizophrenia is related to dopamine. I could have autism. Stimulants never gave me psychosis when they would in 99% of people that get psychosis"". Then someone said ""So you're playing doctor?"" and I said ""I don't really trust my doctor because he doesn't care.. Even about my injection being from 4 to 3 weeks. He said I'm fine. I'm better than a doctor that doesn't care"". Someone said ""You shouldn't self medicate"" and so I said ""It takes years for medications to work - If they even do work and a large portion of people with mental health are always being hospitalized. I'm just taking it into my own hands."" So I just left... I don't get it..."
175954977,I scared myself. I went to the breakroom at work and I didn't turn on the light because it was partially lit from the hallway. I saw something laying on the floor.

Eww. But not as Eww as I first thought. Whew!
175954978,"Withholding information about command hallucinations is not at all uncommon. I have a long history of command hallucinations personally. If she is having them, she is not currently being adequately treated. I am not dissing her psychiatrist, but treatment has to address the commands. The reason for this is that command hallucinations can be dangerous. I don't want to frighten you any more than you already are, but it is the truth. I once did something extremely dangerous in response to a command from God. It destroyed my life. I do not want you all to go through anything like that. Please get this information to the doctor _PERSON_, if you have not already. Thinking of you and wishing you the best."

I see your story as reading a book that hasn’t finished yet, I wouldn’t judge you just because you struggle in some of the pages. You moved out, you got engaged, you did have a job (after years of unemployment), you’re a writer now, you’re good with cooking, you’re the life of the party in our knit tight group, and you are many other good things. Those are achievements that you should be proud of. Life knocked you down countless times but you always stood back up. You will stand up again now.

175954999,I heard back from two psychologists saying that they aren’t accepting new patients. I heard back from this other office and they said they’ll be accepting new patients in February and I could call for an intake. Now I’m a bundle of anxiety today. I wish I could just go home I feel safe and happy at home. I feel like my anxiety is getting worse. The more I think about it and try to do something about it the worse it gets. It’s frustrating. I see my doctor next week again to see how I’m doing on the Lexapro added to my combo of meds. I haven’t gotten hypomanic on them yet so that’s good.

175955001,Feeling good today. I'm getting used to working. I'm getting better every day and fear dp/dr less. That means I can eventually push myself without cracking under stress. I've been taking my meds as prescribed for almost 2 weeks now. No phenibut or benzos and only half of the zopiclone that I used to take. The 10mg of olanzepine has been really good for me.

It was hard for me to accept my mental illness .A couple of years ago my medication was not working so I went to a clinic and the N.P. saw that I was ashamed to give out too much information.She asked me why I felt this way and I told her that I was a man and a veteran so, we are not supposed to feel so bad that we start crying..She put her hand on my shoulder and said : I treat sick people all day long and 70% are sick because they did not look after their health.You did absolutely nothing to have a mental illness so, do not be ashamed and fight until you have the proper medication .If someone can tell you that they have high blood pressure or diabetic why can you not tell them that you have a mental illness..I do not care( anymore) of what people think.You should join a support group( mine meets 
once a week ) and does it ever help to talk with other people who understand your illness.We follow these five bipolar rules; eat healthy, get a good nights sleep,no booze,exercise and never keep negative people around you.This rules are no easy to follow but if you do and have the proper meds,your life will change.Good luck and remember that a lot of people on this forum understand your situation and are routing for you!!!!"

175955008,I found for some more natural ways to help fall asleep there is melatonin and green tea my dr told me about these but I only tried the melatonin. The melatonin helped me sleep one pill 5mg and theyv3 even made some timed capsules for it to.
175955009,"2? Yeah on 22 February... Now it's 4032 deaths total and 627 in the last 24h. The trouble is hospitals can't take so many patients at once. So people die because they couldn't get the care they needed, with that care they might have survived. In Belgium hospitals have gotten guidelines to choose who to admit and who to refuse when it might or will be no longer possible to admit everyone in need of care. It's certainly possible that the virus is man-made but I don't care much. I care about getting what I need in case that in 2 weeks from now I get heavily wounded in a car crash and my survival chance or quality of life is deemed too low to help me because others are in a better state than me. There are certainly younger people also ending up in hospital but the difference is they usually recover, so you don't hear about them in the news. It is possible though they made it much worse themselves by taking the wrong medication (ibuprofen). The patient 1 in Italy was in the hospital for over a month and 
he's only 38."

175955013,"I really need to talk to someone. I shadowed a case manager today. We had to goto an event place with the clients. She drove the last vehicle to depart, with me as a passenger and one client in the back. We avoided traffic by taking the back highways. She was going 90 probably with both hands on her phone and knees driving the steering wheel. We kept going over the bumps on the side that are meant to keep u awake if u fall asleep. In and out of lanes with no blinkers used, many times going out of our lane. At one point we weren't even in a lane, we were going down the middle of the two way road. Which had curves... at high speed. ...I was absolutely terrified beyond belief...BEYOND BELIEF. I texted my fiance at one point and told him I might just get into an accident today. And then when I asked her for suggestions about where to buy cheap furniture in the area, she straight up told me I shouldn't buy on facebook marketplace or thrift stores because she said that since she has had this job she wont 
buy anything used anymore. She told me how clients come in and are covered in bugs, with bugs falling off them, etc dirty/bad hygiene. And she said this in front of a client..."

175955014,I have selective mutism. There are some people who I literally cannot talk to. Like nothing will come out. Suffered with it really bad as a child. Everyone thought I was such a good girl because I didn't speak. Truth was I couldn't ######6 speak because of anxiety. It's funny because really talkative friendly girls and older kids sort of took me under their wings for some reason. Got into drugs and alcohol quite young but still didn't really make a sound. Even got locked up. Did probation for three years and never spoke to probation officer. He took it personal and got me another officer to see. Didn't speak to him either. I remember threatening to knife my social worker once in court when she had me put on a secure order. I've said so little in my life that I can actually remember most of what I've said. Started using amphetamine in late teens and that's when I started talking more and I got ######6 hooked on the stuff just because it made me talk. Used to call it my lifeline. It was like a miracle 
cure for me. Took it for years and went absolutely insane with it. I'm kind of quiet still but I push myself to talk. I can spend days without talking. Its funny how well I do work wise but that's survival.

Unfortunately, that's way too complicated for this place. So, I guess he was a lawyer (not sure) a young man introduced himself just before lunch, and said he's the new person handling my probate stuff. I got into a slight argument when I said I wanted to go home. I was told by two or more people here that I'm more than ready to go out in the community. I told him that this place won't let me go home, and he said very vehemently that if I were ready to be let go, they'd kick me out. I'm so tired of this place.

175955022,There’s a really good chance she’s going to move back with our mom and dad and I would suspect she might even see the same oncologist as my mom just to make things easy. If it were my choice I’d go to an academic hospital that’s about 35 min from them but they seem to have found a decent place anyway. Right now she doesn’t even have insurance though so she’s going to sign up for Obamacare there....which is good timing because it will start in January so most of her bills will get paid.

175955028,"That's crazy... so she thinks she has a relationship with this person? Is it a long distance relationship then?? I heard a joke yesterday from a woman say ""I'm in a long distance relationship because I don't want to be alone, just left alone."" haha She called the credit card company after she talked to me, and I believe they reimbursed her. One of my friends got a call from the IRS and they said to give money now or you'll be taken away in handcuffs when you get home. He panicked hard. Then he called the IRS and they said it must have been a scam because the IRS doesn't threat. (I'm sure they mean ""technically"" don't threat.) My friend then went to the police station and the scammer called him while he was talking to the officer. He handed his phone to him and the policeman had a back and forth for a second until he hung up. After the first call I gave my friend a k-pin because he was having a panic attack. It helped him a lot."
175955029,"Re existential crises, I know they're not fun. Have you tried anything that can bring you back to the moment though? Like a grounding technique? Such as focusing on your breathing or sensations in the body or something like that? I know I'm totally going out on a limb here, meaning that I don't know how existential crises are for you, but for me, sometimes things like meditation help. Also finding something meaningful to do can often help existential crises. Idk, just some food for thought."

175955036,"I agree with you, _PERSON_. Even those who are always on the go need a break every now and then."
175955037,"I’ve always been an introvert, asocial and sensitive. I was always fine with that. I got married to the love of my life and we live together for almost 10 years now, in a small town in Turkey. Our life is simple and mostly calm, and we like it that way. I’m 35 years old woman who always struggled with anxiety since childhood but I was always proud to say I’m in control and I’m very stable. A vegetarian non-smoker non-drinker. I’ve dealt with the death of both my parents. My dad died from a heart attack when he was 70 and I was 24. My mum got clinically depressed after his death and lived with agoraphobia for 4 years when at some point she got embolism from laying too much and died when it reached her lungs. I was heartbroken but not depressed after all this. I was living abroad with my husband and was kinda relieved that mum will not have to suffer anymore living this way. I thought I was strong... In 2016 I started having too much pain all over my body. My lower abdomen, my jaw, my head, 
my ribs. After going to all kinds of doctors I found through laparoscopic surgery that I have endometriosis. A chronic illness of the reproductive system with no known cure. I was in pain, I was very disturbed and it took me a year to get used to this new reality. At some point I got to a place where I was stable and the pain was not too much. Still I can’t do a lot of physical work without starting to hurt. My husband works for us both. In September 2019 I felt the pain getting worse. It caused me a lot of anxiety and stress. I know I need a surgery to remove the Endometriosis from my internal organs. But I kept postponing it because we need to go to Istanbul for it and my husband was busy at work. Now in January I had something like a mental breakdown. Almost every day for three weeks now I cry without a clear reason. I feel sad for no good reason, almost anything can be a trigger. I know that there is help for my endometriosis and I can’t accept that this is why I cry constantly. My house was always my 
safest place, a place I felt secure and peaceful in. Now I’m afraid of staying alone in it. I feel as if I’m suffocating in it. My mind cannot stop racing, I’m so anxious I can’t stay in one place, I always have to move. I feel very tired both mentally and physically. I’m usually kinda lazy and flegmatique by nature so being so anxious and not being able to sit or lie down without getting a fit of anxiety or a panic attack, is something very unusual for me. I remember my mum and how depressed she was and it scares me so much that I will become like her. I love to be in control of everything I do and think, so this state is terrifying to me. I feel like I can’t control my thoughts. I’m scared of my anxiety and I always have a feeling of dread and a tense spot in my chest. The only thing that helps for now is physical activity like yoga, long walks outside and exercise. I do take hormones for my endometriosis and a very low dose of amitriptyline which is prescribed for chronic pain. This combinati
on served me well for 3 years. But I guess something has to change now. I’ll be having an appointment with my neurologist who also works with people with depression. I really hope that I will gradually get better but I also think I got to a place where it’s easy to say I’m really depressed. And my anxiety is just through the roof. I sometimes experience a fear that I might lose my mind and hurt myself, even though I never did such a thing before. I think this is a compulsive-obsessive thought that gets stuck in my head when I get anxious. Did anyone experience anything like that? A mental and nervous breakdown that they cannot seem to control?"
175955038,"It’s ok!!! I do too and I have to be honest, I’ve been slacking the past 2 days myself with that."
175955039,"Darn. I'm getting a migraine. On the plus side, I have my self appraisal just about finished up for work. 4 things I rated myself as good: quality, job knowledge, creativity (do you really want creative accounting?), and judgement (mostly because I'm not in an authority position so I don't have to make tons of decisions) and 7 things I rated myself as very good: productivity, reliability, attendance, independence, initiative, adherence to policy, and interpersonal relationships. (I am waffling on this one as I am normally stuck in my office but I get along okay with my coworkers and in the past three months (the time of the review) I have developed good relationships with one of the owners and two of the coworkers in the NY office.)"

He took my blood pressure and did an ECG.. He said it looked normal.. I felt sleepy from 12am-1am as my sister and I were waiting for the doctor.. He came in and told me that my ECG looks completely normal.. My sister showed him the 2-lead ECG from the Apple Watch and he said that looked normal as well.. (My mom thought it looked different to hers so it must be abnormal). So I came home and went to sleep.. This always happens man.. I have the world's worst heart OCD..

175955082,"Interesting. When I was psychotic, my hallucinations were of real objects, but had what I call auras or fuzzy wavy boundaries that made the object stand out and impossible to ignore. It went along with the entire theme of my disordered thinking. E.g., Photos of eyes in magazines looked back at me and can see inside me. It was penetrating and terrifying. One time my psychiatrist and I discussed this. She told me this was common. I never had an actual hallucination of an object that wasn't in front of me when I was psychotic. The only time I experienced this was in a state of delirium that was due to anticholingeric syndrome."
175955083,"I would certainly be open to trying medication if things are affecting your quality of life a lot. I took zoloft at a very small dose which has an off label use for dizziness. I was also instructed to take klonopin BEFORE I get on a boat when there are bigger waves. Living in MN and having a desire to fish a lot, I tend to spend time on the water. This is a preventative step that then allows me to do something I love, which in turn helps mentally. So consider the medication, it can help.

175955087,"Yes, therapists can use their position and inside information (what you tell them) to hurt their clients rather than help them. I was in a clinic type situation with about 3 therapists and 3 psychiatrists, and was seeing one of the psychiatrists so figured I could pick one of the therapist from the same office. She was horrible, so I reported her to the office manager. So, they replaced her and I got her replacement, and she was horrible so I again complained to the office manager. Then they got rid of me. So, I would definitely consider reporting her so she won't treat others like that. She's not trying to help you, she's trying to bring you down beneath her. There can be repercussions from the clinic, but I would do it anyway. The first time they might let you get away with it. And the second, if they're OK. I know, it's difficult not to report it. If not in a clinic situation, there might be something on the net search engine called, ""reporting psychiatric/therapeutic malpractice"" and have som
e groups that can help. Think of teenagers going in there for help, and getting hurt instead. It happens a lot in the medical field. Remember, there's no one in there listening to what was said, and they know that, so they can always deny it. Their chance of getting caught is very low. But they do not want it reported."

The company is in a country seriously affected by the. corona virus. I feel bad about delaying my start date but know it is the best I could do without worrying about the risk of getting infected.

175955111,"Hormone fluctuations (ovulations, Menses) can cause breast pain, tenderness ,swollen, etc. this can happen x-amount of time before your period or ovulation. It might be helpful for you to track ovulation (which happens approximately 2 weeks after your period) and your period (which happens approximately 2 weeks after ovulation). In doing this you might see a correlation between your breast pain and the other symptoms with your cycle. This might decrease your anxiety and could be something to discuss with your GYN.

175955132,Went well with the doctor. Not much to report. Same old same old. I’m better than I’ve been lately. Haven’t had any breakthrough symptoms really. Except yesterday I felt pretty disconnected from everything but managed to ground myself. See him again in two months. Oh and he got the report back from the psychiatrist from when I last saw her and my doctor sort of rolled his eyes saying it wasn’t very helpful. Exactly how I was feeling at the time lol.

I feel very paranoid around them. I'm not finding enough passion to write anything. No matter what I do, I can't summon any emotion. I think those of us who have anhedonia, I think we're the ones who might have the most disappearing brain matter because thought and emotion are so intimately tied together, and that's why i've had so much avolition, lack of affect.

This is a huge change to be dealing with currently...so know that what you are going through and feeling is expected. I have experienced the weak feelings that you describe as a result of anxiety.

175955163,"I feel like I'm in a very dark era of my life. I feel like I'm in an alternate reality/dimension.. That there are an infinite number of them and my consciousness leads the way and is all that exists. I truly believe that there's forces of good and evil that balance each other out - And no one is in control (Only what I believe is real). Cuz yknow the way an atheist can become a theist with DMT? It's the same as schizophrenia (What you sense - see, hear etc is real and if you believe it, it becomes real to you - But that may not be the truth objectively - Something is collectively molding and weaving everything together because there is such thing as surprises as everything changes with time). I'm speaking to you guys in this dimension.. But if I die right now as I'm typing this in your reality, I continue to type.. So this message would not get to you - So I'm speaking to no one..

175955165,"@ Sydneybarnes, I completely understand. I feel like am always carrying my sadness around and I have no idea when it'll surface. Feel like I am always on edge as a result. Always waiting and never fully able to to enjoy when I am happy because am waiting for the other shoe to drop as they say. I think that just acknowledging that you are feeling that is the first step. For me I have been trying to find acceptance and compassion for that part of myself. Meditating to learn how to stay completely present mentally and emotionally. And most importantly to love myself despite still feeling sad even if I have no idea why."
175955166,"I tapered down to 550mg of phenibut and took 1.2g today to go on the hike because I was feeling a little apathetic. I spent the evening sleeping and having sleep paralysis. I feel stupid right now. But yeah I don't think I'm moving out - My mom will eventually get a place on the Island where my family is. I can't just completely disconnect from my whole family and be alone. I'm a little dependent and won't survive on my own. If someone threw me out on the streets, I wouldn't be able to learn how to survive. I would die."
175955167,"My name is Hunter Brown and I'm 19, I recently moved to a new area for a work opportunity. Aside from suffering OCD, slight ADHD, and severe anxiety for the last 12 years, it has been a rough journey. I dropped out of university right before covid-19 due to mass anxiety spells and since then I have been struggling with it. I have been moved out for a month and honestly I'm not doing to well. I'm currently enrolled in community college while working full-time so I don't tend to get out much, the stress alone from moving out alone and starting a new life in a place where I don't know anyone has taken a toll on me and my mental health is not what I hoped it to be. Aside from my family, my girlfriend is the only other person I can talk to about my issues and due to distance it's hard for her to physically be here to talk me through it all. It seems everyday there are more and more things that just add to my anxiety and it's slowly becoming overwhelming, to the point where I suffer from 3+ severe anxiet
y attacks a day and my attacks show physical symptoms as if I was ill, to the point where it even caused me to miss work for a few days (aside from feeling ill along with it). I never thought my mental health would decline so much/so fast and I'd never thought I would need help, but after so long of just dealing with everything I need any advice I can get. I've never considered self-harm but that's not to say my mental health is fine, I would never self-harm but I've been so overwhelmed with nobody to talk to in my new living area that I don't know what else to do. All of this has caused me to be severely depressed and anxious of everything and being alone just makes it worse, I have used substances in the past to cope but now that I am on my own I don't even consider it as well as the job prohibits it, but I don't know how I can deal with all of this without breaking down about it."
174341530,Ok so I have an idea of how to help with negative symptoms. It's going to be really mentally painful and I can't explain it with thoughts. Just feelings. It's a meditative thing that I will do. I will explain what I did in 3 days using feelings.
175955168,"Yeah, thanks. It's fear about being wrong. Fear of sounding like a fool. Fear of sounding like I don't know what I'm talking about. Fear that others think I'm crazy or cracked up in some way. Fear of what others think of me in general. Fear of ending up on the wrong path."

175955178,I wrote this to explain it in a similar way; When you feel happy but something is really wrong And you can’t feel sad because then you have to let it all go But you can’t and all the thoughts bother you every day All of the things that people have been saying Often the good doesn’t outweigh the bad Because you believe in all of the lies And just want to be free When you want to tell someone how you feel But you don’t want to make a big deal of it So it’s all kept locked inside of your head To suffer in silence and try to not end up dead Depression can evolve into this many years later Or it’s just a matter of what can happen sometimes To anyone

You are going to see the pdoc which is awesome and there could be a medication to help you. I hope you decide to give it a try. I have anxiety too. But mine is like an anticipatory type. When I have to leave the house. I get very anxious before. I do have Xanax which I take when needed. But I do a lot of breathing type exercises and it helps some too. Keep in mind when focusing on your breathing (in through the nose and out through the mouth) that you aren't worrying about anything. So breathe.. It does help me. Hang in there and let us know how things go. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175955205,"This was pretty common for me. Since I've been on meds that control my hallucinations and delusions it happens less often. I still space out a lot and have trouble, especially in the morning with figuring out what happened in my dreams versus reality. It took a few years and some hospitalizations but for the last 4.5 years I've been hallucination and delusion free. I'm thankful to no longer have the girl living in my closet and I suspect your clown is just as intrusive. If you haven't sought medical help yet I'd encourage you to do so.

175955220,"Childhood Emotional Neglect is both simple in its definition and powerful in its effects. It happens when your parents fail to respond enough to your emotional needs while they’re raising you. Emotional Neglect is an invisible, unmemorable childhood experience. Yet unbeknownst to you, it can hang over you like a cloud, coloring your entire adult life. What makes Childhood Emotional Neglect (CEN) invisible and unmemorable? Several important factors. First, it can happen in otherwise loving, caring families that lack for nothing materially. Second, your parents’ failure to respond is not something that happens to you as a child. Instead, it’s something that fails to happen for you as a child. Our eyes don’t see the things that fail to happen. And so our brains can’t record them. Decades later, an adult, you sense that something is not right, but you don’t know what it is. You may look at your childhood for answers, but you cannot see the invisible. So you are left to assume that something 
is innately wrong with you. “Whatever is wrong, i t’s my own fault,” you secretly believe. “I’m different from other people. Something is missing. I’m flawed.” Yet it’s not your fault . There are answers . And once you understand the problem , you can heal.

175955232,"Feeling a bit of derealization or whatever it is. I've had it for about two days now. It's not so intense like last year where I'd immediately get a panic attack. Ketamine made it worse on my last dose, psilacetin did at the end of 5mg, and a candy flip also caused it before. I wonder if my Invega injection is on Friday (Then that might be why). I wonder if I take a 5mg olanzepine then I'll feel better. But I'm going to take 100mg Seroquel tonight instead of 50mg (My psychiatrist says I can take anywhere from 25-100mg). At first I thought derealization was a form of psychosis, then I was told it was panic attacks (But it just caused panic attacks). Now I find out that it's a completely different thing.. A form of dissociation.. But I'll try not to think too much about it. I believe I'm delaying any symptoms of psychosis by being in a meditative state of not thinking about it until it all builds up.

175955244,"I recommend joining a site like IMVU where you can meet other people and chat with them. It's a great option because if you don't feel comfortable around someone, you can block them and never have to face them again, but it gives you an opportunity to explore new things and meet others from the safety of your home. Plus, there is a huge, highly accepting LGBTQ community there which is definitely nice."

When I do the sleeping meditation I sometimes relax all my muscles first. But generally I just repeat my mantra to my breathing. Two syllables in two syllables out, or one in and one out.

175955286,"Is there any reason for a 400GB one instead of a 512GB one? Since you're in NY, check this out: SanDisk 512GB Extreme UHS-I microSDXC Memory SDSQXA1-512G-AN6MA I know it's kinda expensive, but I think it pays itself off, especially since it supports 4K gaming (and thus, less lag/delays). Switch I think is 1080p, so it technically doesn't ""need"" 4K support, but the fast RW speeds are ideal. $30 difference between 400GB and 512GB, but if 512GB is out of your budget, then yeah, 400GB would be fine. But I just thought I'd point out that there isn't a huge price difference. I have a Lexar 128GB high speed micro SD. I just checked and it's this one: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lexar-128...pter/_PHONE_NO_ Back when I got the switch in 2017, the 128GB cards were like $100, so that's the only reason I have 128 instead of 512 or whatever. I do think that Sandisk is a better quality brand, though. But I got Lexar because all the Sandisk and Samsung ones were sold out. (Everyone buying the Switch at once and 
buying micro SD cards at once.)"

175955289,"I can relate to the stressful, overwhelming job. And I can also relate to the not happy or sad... the blah. Going through the motions. I know it may not be the solution, but alleviating your stress from the job will allow you to think. To think about what YOU want -- no, what you NEED -- to think about, and not what's next, or unfinished, at work. I thought I would be the last person to say that you have to let go of the job, but I was forced to move into a lower gear, if you will, when my sister lost a child. I could not function normally for a year and a half -- and I'm still not out of it. But it taught me a lot about the time I've spent sweating a &$^(%#%) job!!! I had to cut my consulting work down, and amazingly -- we survived k. The experience made me realize that we would be okay, even if we didn't have as much $. I would have rather been with my family over those years, and I am thankful that I didn't figure it out too late (although I of course would rather the impetus, my niece's passing
, had never happened). My point is that you have to find different work/something else. Even if you are self-employed. ****Your family wants you more than they want the $**** Do you take something for anxiety or an anti-depressant?

175955290,To anyone reading this that is on benzodiazipines and may not be aware you cannot take benzos for an extended amount of time and quit cold turkey. It can literally kill you. If you just take them occasionally like OP without any effects between doses you should be fine. DO NOT quit benzos cold turkey. Look up the _NAME_ manual for more information. _USER_ID_ does have exemplary use and I commend him for it. The reason benzos are not easily available is due to several factors. Doctors don't want to be responsible if you become dependent and abuse of benzos (particularly Xanax) is quite common. Benzos and opiods are a dangerous mix and sadly many people have fatal effects combining the two for recreational uses. I see some strong feelings about benzos in this thread but I don't think people that use them as needed are weak for utilizing medication as prescribed to them. We are all different. Some only need them once in awhile and some need high doses just to get through the day. At my peak panic attac
k cycle benzos were a miracle drug that enabled me to function. I have slowly tapered down from a high dose to around 2 mg. I will continue to taper until I am benzo free. It is a long process but I feet it will be worth it. A physical need (dependence) for benzos has nothing to do with addiction or an addictive personality. Most people who use a benzo consistently (not once in awhile) for more than 2 to 4 weeks will have to taper off. Your GABA receptors are affected and your body gets dependent. Simple as that. Willpower (unless you are abusing or recreationally using ..please don't do this) has nothing to do with it. If you have been on benzos for any length of time you will need to taper much like _PERSON_ has. This will vary based on individual and medication. I make a cut and wait at least four weeks to cut again for example.

I probably mentioned it 2-3 years ago as well here. I have a void in my life. Big void. I've tried everything from relationships to sex, to hobbies and buying things, to school and jobs. Nothing makes me happy. Never really has since I've been well. I talked to door. She thinks I might need to do some soul-searching in the bible. (I told her idk if I needed God or something). But I seemed happy when I was psychotic and also before. Not like depression free, but like the hole seemed pretty much or all filled. I remember when I was psychotic I would do some things. Like goto the coffee shop every afternoon and drink coffee and write. Pick up a newspaper everyday. And other little things. Eventually all that got old. One thing I remember is I felt closer to God somewhat because of my voices. I heard Angel's and God. But also demons. And 
when i heard demons i would always turn to god. Idk what I'm trying to say. I just don't know what that void is. Idk if its spiritual, economic, health wise, etc I mean I have no clue. Idk."

175955319,"I've been considering this for quite a while so below I'll share some personal examples. I'm firm in my belief that we can ""get better"" and overcome most symptoms of our disorder. I don't know (rather doubt) if I'll ever feel like ""normies"" do when they see other people but I can't not work at this slab of granite. I'm really interested to understand how thought processes happen for other schizoids or if I'm alone when I say mine feels like fighting some kind of involuntary defense mechanism. Examples of my day-to-day thinking are difficult to dredge from consciousness even for transmission on this forum. When I reach for something to share things happen automatically and the task is almost impossible. I sort of fight myself in a way? For example those sentences took nearly 10 minutes to type because my mind kept going blank and thinking unrelated thoughts. It's like I'm losing focus or something even though I'm intent to communicate and still ""thinking"". Sometimes I need to like forcefully r
e-engage myself with the real world and even then I feel like I need coaxing to supply real information. My false self seems so strong and if I'm not monitoring it I'll derail myself and be in my fantasy for 20 minutes before realizing it and getting back to the real task. It's infuriating because I have nothing to show for that 20 minutes of what felt like deep thought and oftentimes I can't help it. I'm applying some mindfulness techniques suggested by a therapist with some success. It's incredibly taxing though and by the end of the day I'm mentally exhausted. I hope it's like a muscle so that with time it becomes easier from all the exercise. ^ That's just alone when I'm trying to work ^ With other people in the equation it gets complicated... Automatic withdrawals, deflecting conversations about anything ""real"", intellectualization, complete false-self takeover. My thinking in interactions with others depends who I'm with and why we're together (of course), but just like when alone "" I "" get lost in 
the exchange sometimes. After the event I'm prone to be mad at my inability to be real. This is probably too long already and if you got this far reading it I'm really grateful you took the time. It'd be nice if you could contribute insight into your own thinking when alone or in social settings but even a comment on mine would be good too. I'm open to questions for clarification but please be kind. This wasn't easy to share -?"
175955320,Yeah I don’t have my doctor to talk to all the time. Or my therapist. I could ask my mom to help but that makes me feel like a child.

175955350,Feeling better. The cps case manager said me staying here wasn’t a concern but my roommates cousin is. Which I’ll say if he did what they said he did than he better off in prison for the rest of his life.
175955351,"I don’t understand the American system. You see a psychiatrist on the regular? I see a family doctor and a psychologist on the regular. I pay for the psychologist, my health plan covers the family doctor. I see the psychiatrist on occasion when referred by my family doctor."
175955352,I went for a hike. I feel like I climbed Mt. Everest.. Except it was hot and blue sky... I'm so tired. I have to sleep in two hours to get up for work in the morning. My mom said that she doesn't think I can handle working too much.. But I'll try.. At least I get extra money. I took anti-inflammatory medicines. My veins are big. I might die soon maybe before age 30.
175955353,my grandparents just sat me down and said they were worried about me because I was sleeping so much. Freaking zyprexa lol
175955354,I think people are after me. People at work hate me. The drugs are starting to mask it but I know what's real. I'm being forced to take the meds that I know are poison. I hate it. No one understands they call me delusional. My brain is working overtime and I can't focus... That's what's going on.
175955355,I'd go for happy and energetic! Unfortunately I think I'm too old for both those things.
175955356,"I've been an Audible subscriber for several years now. My library is pretty good on there. Anyway, tonight I am just having a cup of coffee and trying to relax. I still haven't been able to do work (official work). I mean, they won't fire me if I don't work, right? I am just really anxious about the whole thing. I know they probably will fire me eventually if I don't schedule any shifts. But it's all good, right? I just don't know how to think about work. I know it's probably a good thing to have work right now, but I am really struggling to find meaning in my life and with having a job and whatever else I'm doing. There is basically nothing that is meaningful in my life right now..."
175955357,Yeah that's true. People that judge aren't stupid. I'm just so non-judgemental cuz my narcissistic step dad was so judgemental and I hate him.
175955358,"I took everything, including fish oil, this morning. So just have my evening supplements to take yet."

175955360,I'm worried because on my psychiatrists site he said he doesn't usually do disability paperwork. My review is probably coming up soon so I'm gonna need a psychiatrist to write a letter at least. Ugh.

175955362,With smelling things that are there I have smelled a strong smell of rotting meat or a dead body when I wasn't anything around to give off that smell. I sometimes get bad dreams and feeling sensations like being raped and stuff when I was a kid. IDK if that'll qualify as a touch hallucination but I have had sensations of bugs crawling on me.
175955363,Hey! Finished work. 5 hours...not bad. Dismissed my daughter at 11. She’s a hot mess with allergies but she had testing in the AM. Now I’m just laying around listening to music.

175955370,"Ah, but I also feel like I'm super anxious today. So maybe that's a reminder that I still need support and help."
175955371,Haven't had a panic attack in 4 days
175955372,"Thank you everyone for your feed back. I am very self aware of how I feel. I keep a mood journal to track how I feel daily, weekly. Im pretty confident in my self assessments but do use feedback and other experiences to maintain and build my confidence. I do communicate these things with my Dr. I'm not looking for someone to "" agree"" with me just seeking feedback from others who may have used this medicine longer than I have. Not just read side effect labels that 's that Dr's often say "" no that's not a side effect"". Anyway thank you all again. I'm sure with more time and lots of practicing what I learn in therapy etc.. I will be good. Also it's good to know that even with meds you can still have off days but not worry. After the rain comes the sun! I sure do use my condition to better my self and help others. I follow up with my Dr. in a few weeks.I'll keep tracking my mood until then. Thank you again!"
175955373,I feel that extra abilify did nothing. Idk what else I’m supposed to do.
175955374,"Hi Caritas and welcome! I am sorry to hear that your fear of heights/stairs is getting to be more challenging for you. I am also sorry to hear that your doctor was not more helpful in finding you the resources and treatment that you need. You must be starting to feel very frustrated and without hope. The good news is there *is* hope to conquer/manage your anxiety! It sounds like what you are dealing with is a specific phobia, and much can be done to help you move past this place where you have gotten stuck as a result of your fears. One thing I recommend is specifically asking your doctor for a therapy referral. This will help you in two ways. *One*, you will learn the skills you need to overcome your fear of going down the stairs. There are specific steps to exposure therapy that will challenge you, but eventually help free you to do the things you want and need to do! The *second* thing a therapist can help ascertain is whether or not an Rx is the right choice for you as part of your treatment pl
an. Antidepressants *are* prescribed for anxiety. This is not to say that you are dealing with depression...but the medication does help with both issues. This is why your doctor prescribed it...but if you are reluctant to take it...asking your therapist for either a second recommendation on this...or his/her opinion that therapy alone will suffice for you, will give you a clear direction! Another thing that you can get started on right away is self help. At the top of our main forum page here you will find our Resource Guide. In it you will find Therapy Worksheets as well as links specifically for dealing with phobias. Take a look and give the exercises a try. You will likely find them very helpful! Keep posting with us as well. We understand, care and support is key! Talk soon, _PERSON_ Cat"
175955375,I keep going on and off the coffee bandwagon. Saturday I went off again and I went through the ritual migraine that day. lol That should teach me for a couple months!

175955377,"Remember I was talking about loud noises when the Vyvanse wears off? Also my panic attack starting when I went outside and my lips/hands were cold? It says L-Tyrosine ""Helps to decrease cognitive fatigue due to physically stressful situations (e.g. Extended wakefulness, exposure to cold, excessive noise)"" L-Tyrosine is a dopamine persecutor. So is L-Dopa and a few other things. Honestly,.. My dopamine is LOW. NOT high!. The Invega Sustenna injection kicks in and then I can't stay awake long, I become sensitive to noise and exposure to cold and become unfocused. The antipsychotics aren't good for me. Maybe low dose but not such a high dose."
175955378,Yes that's cuz alcohol is really flexible with the brain - The brain recovers easily from alcohol which is why there's a strong rebound (hangover) so tolerance builds really slowly.. I think..
175955379,"Every time I read about thorazine it's noted that it's extremely sedating. You're on another AP too, right? I'm surprised too."
174341814,"I don't think they're real because I'm a forced atheist. At most, I don't know because I'm an agnostic. And I'm a pantheist for fun. Before taking an overdose of a psychedelic which induced a severe psychotic state, I was a complete atheist just because of the way that my brain was wired. I was very logical and analytical. So in my opinion, reality isn't you or me, it's the external world including us. I go as far as to believe I'm God in a psychotic state just because the feeling and thought won't leave me alone. It's like how people say ""Drugs are just a crutch for reality"". Drugs don't change your reality. Reality stays the same. Demons don't occur in nature without lifeforms to envision them. If there was no life, who would know what demons are? Would we all be in the afterlife with the ""demons""? People work together and there's no evidence that demons are seen by multiple people at the same time. For all we know, 30 people that seen demons could all be hallucinating at the same time. It co
uld be a coincidence. For demons to be actually real (To find common ground between us in a way..), humans would have to create them physically using holograms, projectors, matter based or using energy weapons and thought reading technology. What matters with thought reading technology is being able to ignore the fact that it could exist. I'm not saying it does exist. It's possible. Anything is possible. But then it's the other way around.. It's your own reality that is making it true because of neurochemistry, a chemical imbalance. Eastern society says that Western society has lost it's connection with spirit. It just depends on how you look at things. If the way you're looking at it is causing you pain, in your case, antipsychotics can change the brain chemistry.. but people can be psychotic just out of sheer environmental coincidence if they have the gene.. but there's multiple genes not just one gene. Marijuana can cause schizophrenia easily in those predisposed to it. Or maybe it does cause schizophrenia
. I haven't done enough research in my own opinion to be comfortable with saying it doesn't. It could be propaganda to trick people in the opposite direction than in the 50's with ""reefer madness"". It was easy enough to trick people with that, the drug war and everything else that is wrong with this world."
175955380,You need to talk to a professional honey. They have to put you on the right drugs. They do work when you take them correctly.... pls talk to someone u trust and go to a specialist. Together with therapy. You have a lot. On your shoulders... Good luck _NAME_

175955388,"So to reiterate something I say here periodically, there are two parts to a diagnosis. One is all those criteria, the other is that it has to cause some kind of disadvantage or harm to the person. Depending on the point in my life, I've switched back and forth between having a disadvantage or harm and not. When you've got a stable lifestyle, autonomy, independence, all those schizoid traits can be potentially fine. They might just think you're eccentric. At the moment I'm making decent money and being tolerated, though I don't know how long that will last. Life is good. To me the biggest difference with a narcissist is that they still hinge on some kind of peer response. Maybe they pick something like intellect, sex appeal, etc. But if they ever obtain true inherent confidence, they'll lose the rest of the narcissist baggage in time. The schizoid may or may not have escaped that baggage, but their core difference as far as I understand it is the ""schizo"" bit, or rather more normally the word ""sp
lit."" The schizoid could be a narcisist as well, but the beginning of that diagnosis is that mind-body split. For good and ill, the schizoid person has a ""split"" between the mind/mental and body/physical to one degree or another in one way or another. Where the N seems to be desperate for validation of something, the Schizoid could just as well have that or not, but there's definitely some kind of impulse or overlap where being one or the other can push you towards the other. Hense why I feel like I can ""rip and shred"" narcissists a bit. Because I'm so similar, but different enough, I tend to be able to see their flaws and am largely immune to their tools."
175955389,"Growing older and totally alone. Any friend I have ever had has either died or moved away. I have no one to turn to. I so need a friend I can talk to. I have tried to reach out.

I can't take antidepressants due to the fact that my gastroparesis doesn't allow my stomach to digest the medication properly. I am so alone and sad. I use to work. I use to have a life. Now I sit alone in my apt. existing and wondering why and what for. I am not a very technically smart person, but I did manage to find this online community in hopes someone would understand and reach out to me. If you can relate to what I am dealing with and you would like an honest, loving, caring and overly sensitive person to communicate with that is in need of a friend to talk to, then please reach out to me.

I have a very lonely war going on inside of my head and I just want someone to reach out to me and let me know they understand. I have tried to accept life as it is and accept my illnesses, but I am having a very hard time doing it. I have reached out for therapy but it didn't help. I need to find meaning in my life again. I need a friend to message with. Someone to help me stay hopeful and help me get rid of these negative thoughts that are taking over in my head. I feel alone and empty, with no meaning left.

175955398,I've been using acne cream since I was 18 - Doctor prescribed it (She was very nice. She asked me to tell the psychiatrist that diagnosed me with schizophrenia to put me on disability and use the money for school. She also told him to put me on Vyvanse instead of Concerta because it's better long term for the cardiovascular system). I think the acne is finally starting to go away idk. I'm almost 25. But I craved chocolate again last night! Olanzepine will make me 400lbs I swear.. Unless I get prescribed Dexedrines.. It was like I was starving for sugar.

I suffer from depression and often find it really difficult to find anyone I feel comfortable talking to about my mental health struggles. I take medication and used to go to counseling, but my current situation has prevented me from going for 4 months or so. I didn’t think counseling helped that much but now that I’m not going I can feel a shift in my mental state not really for the better. I rarely share things with family because I know I will be frustrated with their response. They both in work in fields that deal with mental health quite often so they support me but they don’t understand. My mom has said things like why aren’t you satisfied with everything you have or you just need to wake up and say it’s gonna be a great day. I am satisfied and I do try but sometimes I wake up and the feelings that I have are so crippling. It’s like a dark cloud around my brain and inner self that just won’t go away. I fight 
everyday but sometimes lose the battle. A lot of my friends don’t even know I have depression. I’m so afraid of being judged and viewed differently. I’m hoping that seeing other posts and similar struggles from people who understand can help me start to manage and get back to bettering the condition of my mental health."
175955412,"One recent high profile case of a diagnosed schizoid is the Charlottesville white supremacist. Mass murderers are mainly paranoid though. https://nmcdn.io/e186d21f8c7946a19faed2 ... nd_Men.pdf In the sample of 235 American mass killers, one was a schizoid with intense rage who sought infamy (_NAME_); one was schizotypal (_NAME_ [_NAME_]); and three were autistic: _PERSON_ CHO (_NAME_ Tech), _NAME_ (Newtown), _NAME_(Santa _NAME_). Possibly, indeed. A passive and lonely person can look like an easy target. Some schizoids are desperately lonely and can go as far as serial murder to keep their companions with them. One such example is _NAME_, who was otherwise a likeable and decent person. I disagree. Don't you feel intense anger (rage?) yourself? Schizoids are known for their risk of committing impulsive murders, possibly fueled by rage like the case of _NAME_. Similar to schizoids, are autistic persons: they are rarely violent but in the exceptional case where they commit a violent crime, the outburs
t will likely be a final act by someone who has been unable to sense what others feel, unable to relate to them in any meaningful way, let alone form an intimate friendship with anyone."

175955414,"I went to my doctor appointment yesterday (PCP). I was anxious. She makes me anxious. Probably because the first time I met her she sent me for a psych eval. _PERSON_. She thinks I'm crazy I think. Anyway, most of my labs were good, blood pressure was good, kidneys were good, liver was good, I'm not pre-diabetic, but I have high bad cholesterol. My overall cholesterol is okay but the bad is too high. So she wants to put me on this medication. Only I got a text from my pharmacy saying it's not covered by my insurance. So then I called the doctor's office and she was like oh we have a woman for that so just let them handle it. It's probably going to be expensive because it's probably going to be tier 3 or hope to heaven not tier 4 if its not covered by insurance. Of course the woman wanted to do a pap smear but it's not a good time of the month for that so I was like maybe next time. Anyway, I have to go back in November for a follow up. What a crock.

I you had some heartburn from eating the trigger foods a few days back...it can take some time for the pain to subside. Did you try using an OTC med for relief? Also what everyone above has said is true. Anxiety/panic can cause thoracic muscles to become sore due to overuse (hyperventilation) and tensing up. I have experienced this, and I can assure you it will go away. Try your best to trust your doctor, and remember that a heart issue would not be an isolated symptom, but rather a whole group of them. Work your coping skills to keep your anxiety managed and I am sure you will be feeling relief soon. Keep us updated so we can keep you in support! S.C."

He then started to say he is scared because he just got out of a relationship a month ago and she was cheating on him. We have brought up our past relationships but I don’t want to anymore. I want this guy and I to have a real shot. I want to give him the version of me that was calm happy fun . I want to be with this guy for more than a month . Has anyone who has had a past traumatic relationship experience hinder any attempt with the new relationships ? How do I not get worked up and worried this guy is going to leave like everyone else? I want to see myself moving forward with this 
guy. He is worth it.

I never thought about bringing those thoughts specifically up to her before so thank you I guess I never really verbalized them before I posted them here tonight because I felt if I did so it would make them more real and I guess I didn't want to acknowledge them for some reason

175955458,I’m sorry to read all of this. You are in a lot of pain. Anyone you can talk to? You need some more synchronized help... have you talked to a psychiatrist and also a therapist? Your hospital experience was awful... that is not what I expect from a good hospital... hope you can find some help. Sometimes even the good samaritans have a hotline or a community help that would attempt some type of support. I know you are not alone. But you do need to reach out for help and find an advocate to guide you. Good luck

175955466,"I am so sorry you're going through this. However, you found what you were looking for that is why you should never ever disrespect anyones privacy by snooping around. Because now you have found what you were looking for and right now you can't handle it. BUT, now that you've found out some truths that were never intended for you to know. You need to take a couple slow deep breaths, inhale and exhale as slowly as man possible to let everything that is heavy on your shoulder out and away. After you're done breathing you must come to acceptance with yourself that you found some truths that were never intended for you to know. I went through this same thing and learned my lesson. Now you have some options on how to handle this, you can either get a therapist & talk with them until you feel a sense of peace inside you, or even better just face your boyfriend and come clean about what you did, which was snoop on his phone and you're very sorry. Let him know what you found out by snooping, and that you're 
not mad but it is concerning, you know what you did wasn't right but the reality of what you found is concerning and you would like to talk with him about it; in order for you to be at peace with not only yourself but your him as well, and you need to talk about it, and express to him what you're concerned within the findings that you found in his phone. And do this as calmly as possible because in all reality you're livid inside, your boyfriend is going to be livid inside as well and it is going to bring up new trust issues, now because snooping always inevitably opens up another door to a new minor issue. But it can be very well fixed with proper approach. As calm as possible address him about what you found and you're very sorry for going through his stuff and it won't happen again. Then, further on by saying I am concerned with and start listing off concern1, concern2, etc, etc in whatever it is that you found in his phone. You put yourself and your boyfriend in a very vulnerable position and this is a to
ugh one but its managable. You got this, I believe in you. Just do not get enraged and loud! Try and treat it as an open door policy and you're talking about something that concerns you and will better your relationship and bond in the long run, if handled properly and calmly. I hope you start feeling better and I hope my little bit of advice helps you approach your difficult situation, even a little. Try not to snoop anymore. Practice self control it works wonders for success in anything you do. I'm on the holistic side try drinking some chamomile tea or peppermint tea to calm you down with honey. Or taking a _NAME_.

175955504,"When we speak about narcissism, we often focus on the individual. He or she is narcissistic. He or she is a victim of a narcissist. Yet what about those victims who are bullied and targeted by groups filled with narcissistic individuals or in a group where the narcissistic pack leader has toxic enablers? What happens when there is a conspiracy led by an entire group against one individual? Contrary to popular belief, narcissism can and does run in group dynamics too – it just plays out on an even more massive and destructive scale. Rather than one partner abusing another, there is an entire group working to undermine and plot against a chosen target. This is especially harmful to any chosen victim because research shows that social rejection activates the same areas of the brain as physical pain (_PERSON_, et. al 2011). Theoretically, being emotionally abused by a manipulative group can be at times just as painful as being physically assaulted. The frontrunners of such a group use enablers or wha
t is colloquially termed “flying monkeys” to ensure that the recipients of such bullying are properly silenced (_PERSON_, 2017). This is also known as “mobbing,” where a toxic individual enlists the help of others to carry out his or her vicious campaign and dirty work against another individual (_PERSON_, 2013). We see this unhealthy, abusive dynamic play out within the realm of the narcissistic family unit, friendship circles, workplaces and anywhere there is a possibility for bullying. This form of conspiracy may not be technically “illegal,” but it poses great harm to those who are targeted. The target suffers through unbelievable emotional, verbal, perhaps even physical abuse at the hands of the toxic group, who uses them as a scapegoat for the group’s problems and deviant desires. Therapist _NAME_ (2017) writes that: “The purpose of a scapegoat is to pass responsibility onto someone else. Usually this person is unsuspecting at first and agrees because they are trying to get along with ot
hers. This technique of passing the buck is very common with narcissists, sociopaths, and addicts. Narcissists can’t allow their ego to be tarnished by an error. Sociopaths do it for the sport of it.” For an excellent example of how a narcissistic group dynamic can undermine and scapegoat one individual, one needs to look no farther than the devastating bullying Today Show co-host _NAME_ suffered under the reign of _NAME_ (who has now been exposed as a sexual predator) and her colleagues back in 2011. According to Vulture, executive producer _NAME_ Bell reportedly launched what was known as “Operation Bambi,” a mission to eradicate _PERSON_ from the team, early on in her employment (he denies this, of course). She was subjected to not only _PERSON_’s mistreatment but also exclusion, taunting and bullying by her other colleagues as a result. In 2012, a clearly traumatized _PERSON_ was forced to leave the show in a highly televised exit despite the fact that she was, and remains today, a highly talent
ed, empathic and one-of-a-kind journalist. In fact, NBC lost more than a fifth of its audience after her departure. This example illustrates something deeply important: groups with one or more sociopaths do not target people who are incompetent. On the contrary, they target those who threaten the status quo in some way. _PERSON_ represented the type of conscientious, empathic and sincere person that juxtaposed _PERSON_’s own predatory personality and threatened the group dynamic of keeping toxic behavior under the wraps. Since the corporate world tends to favor and promote sociopathic individuals, they chose _PERSON_’s preferences over _PERSON_’s potential and incredible abilities to connect with her viewers in a deeply compassionate way. To make the conspiracy all the more effective, the victim is further silenced by what makes them so special in the first place – their ability to be discerning, their sensitive nature, their compassion, is used to paint them as unhinged should they dare speak out. Th
e victim’s own wounds are played with. The narcissistic group feeds upon the victim’s insecurities and vulnerabilities to ensure that the victim feels too powerless to complain or take action. They identify the wounds and weaknesses of the target. They also use the target’s strengths against him or her. They emotionally blackmail their targets. They exhaust their targets. They gaslight their targets into believing that the abuse isn’t occurring. And ultimately, they bully them into contributing to the group’s deviant agenda. The manipulative leaders of narcissistic conspiracies find ways to covertly abuse the victim so they can escape accountability for their actions. The victim is made to feel like and look like the “crazy” one – and everyone is able to avoid individual responsibility for inflicting harm and participating in the conspiracy. In all narcissistic “conspiracies,” this scapegoat is a “black sheep” who is treated like an outsider of the group. This chosen black sheep is the
n terrorized, taunted, excluded, persecuted and becomes the site of many projections or unfair blame for the mistakes of the narcissistic group. The group has no problem using the victim to advance their agenda or add to their resources, but they fail to recognize or reward the efforts of that individual in a fair way. In fact, the harder the scapegoat works to win the approval of the group, the more the scapegoat is persecuted. Since the group is usually led by one or more narcissistic or sociopathic individuals, very little mercy or empathy is given to the victim. The victim suffers emotional terrorism at the hands of ruthless individuals who prey on his or her vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Narcissists and sociopaths usually choose those they are envious of and threatened by. These victims are exploited for their strengths, but demeaned, teased and made to feel like outsiders, just as _PERSON_ was. The alienation takes a toll on victims of group bullying, as they may isolate themselves even more just to a
void further persecution. How And Why Is The Victim Chosen? The target that is chosen to be bullied and ostracized from the group is one that is threatening in some way. It could be because they threaten the narcissistic leaders or enablers in their intelligence, appearance, resources, determination, ambition, social aptitude, wealth, independence – or whatever other quality that evokes their envy or fear. In the dynamics of a family with one or more narcissistic individuals as caregivers, the scapegoat is the child or children who are most devalued and demeaned, made to feel less than. These children are often outspoken, sensitive, empathic and have integrity. They present a threat to the existing dysfunction of the toxic family unit, so they are inevitably punished. They are pitted against the “golden children” (children who are excessively overvalued and spoiled in exchange for their blind obedience) and triangulated so that there is a sense of competition, distrust and supreme allegiance to the narc
issistic parent or parents in the household. In a group that is not familial, such as friendship circles or the workplace, the chosen victim is usually someone new to the group or a long-standing member who “dares” to question the authority of the narcissists or sociopaths within that group and is thus excommunicated. These victims may at first be idealized and love-bombed. They are subjected to praise, laser-focused attention, gifts and false promises to lure them into the group. They are “groomed” to feel like a part of the group, which often has many cult-like qualities which discourage dissent and discussion. There are implicit rules to never unmask the toxicity of the group or its decisions. Questions are always met with ambiguous or vague answers or outright reprimands and punishment. The victim’s duty is to keep quiet, remain a scapegoat and not make a fuss about carrying out dirty work for the group. So long as the victim abides by these silent rules, they win temporary safety through their 
obedience. The authority of the narcissistic members of the group is upholded as the final say, regardless of fairness or equity. As soon as the victim starts to question the dynamics of the group, however, or the group feels like the new victim might potentially “overthrow” the hierarchy in some way, the victim is then “put back” in his or her place. They may be publicly humiliated in front of other members of the group, they may be dismissed, they may be shut down and stonewalled. They may have an ongoing smear campaign against them by the leaders or enablers of those leaders regarding their character, stability and ability to be within the group. It is easy to make the victims of group bullying seem like the unhinged ones – the most abusive people, the leaders of the group, work hard to drive their targets over the edge and push all of their emotional buttons. Groupthink and The Bystander Effect Not all group members of the cult-like conspiracy are unempathic, but when they participate in enablin
g behavior, it creates a collective consciousness, what psychologists call “groupthink” in which a narcissistic unit works together to render the victim powerless enough so that the victim either feels unable to exit or even becomes “trauma-bonded” in some way to the group as a way to survive (Rosenblum, 1982). Those who see the victims being bullied and yet fail to do anything about it usually encounter what it known as “The Bystander Effect,” in which individuals feel as if they don’t have to intervene, especially as the group gets larger, because personal accountability is diminished (_PERSON_, 2014). The chosen target usually has empathy, resilience and is authentic in their integrity. They are agreeable, kind and conscientious to a fault, which makes them ideal prey for sociopathic predators. They are open and willing to consider other perspectives, so they are taken advantage of easily by narcissistic leaders and their enablers. This is very threatening to a group that works best without i
ntegrity or fairness. These are all qualities narcissists look for to ensnare their victims, but of course, most narcissistic groups realize that such qualities also make these victims powerful as well. Truth-tellers are commonly scapegoated in groups where there is toxicity brimming beneath the surface. The target fulfills the following roles: As a convenient scapegoat. They take the blame for any errors or mistakes the narcissistic group or leaders don’t want to be held accountable for. They become the outlet for any projections, rage, dissatisfaction that the group wants to dump on them. A target for an ongoing smear campaign in which the narcissistic individuals involved spread rumors, gossip and misinformation to make you look like a “troublemaker.” This ensures that other group members also fear calling out the toxic dynamics of the group because they don’t wish to be associated with you or your “antics.” To obscure the truth and further the group’s selfish agenda, whatever that might be. 
They stroke the narcissist’s ego – they are made to feel diminished so that the narcissists in the group feel superior. It feels especially gratifying for them to take down a person who is more successful and well-liked (at least initially before scapegoating begins) than they are. They are used to strengthen closer alliances among the already existing cliques in the group. Membership in the group is emphasized and seen as exclusive and coveted because there are “outsiders” who can’t get in. If you are a victim of scapegoating or a black sheep, take heart. You were chosen because you have the qualities that narcissists lack. You were chosen because you were threatening. You were chosen because you were powerful. They saw that power in you, and they wanted to take it away. Though it appears now that wolves in sheep’s clothing rule the world, it is actually scapegoats who have the power and ability to lead others – authentically. When the black sheep finds community, validation and resources to he
lp them thrive after the experiences of being persecuted and alienated, they reconnect with the amazing qualities that made them a target in the first place. Rest assured that karma does come for those who conspired against them – and predators like _PERSON_ are always eventually exposed in due time. Scapegoats can and will rise above the conspiracy – and they can grow stronger in spite of it. References"

174342047,"Hello everyone, I have been feeling psychotic 'on and off' for many years now. I think it was more consciously hidden by myself before now, due to not wanting others to know how ill, alone and scared I felt. I had an awful traumatic childhood including a narrcissistic mother and secret abuse from my father for 12 years. Schizophrenia is in my father's side of the family. His sister got diagnosed later in adulthood and she went from being so clever, having a Scholarship to not being able to cope with the basics of day to day living, let alone work. I remember her in her dressing gown all the time, drinking coffee, which is coincidentally what comforts me. I hate the world right now, I suppose I always have done. I have encountered many nasty people and situations along the way. Even this 'SARS-Co-vid-19' virus is not making others grateful for what they have. They have to start fights with others in public. The world will get back to normal at some point, whatever normal is!? I last recall feeling t
his bad when I lived alone in my flat, I tried to keep down 3 jobs at one time to pay for it, and I just ended up getting so overwhelmed and stressed (what I classified as feeling 'mad'). This occurred when I moved out of my parents home (against their wishes), because my father wouldn't stop molesting me. I couldn't function properly and had suffered so much emotional abuse (from both parents), that I was scared to be in the 'big' world. I still am terrified. This brings me on to just a couple of hours ago. The NHS called the police round because I had to ring up to say I wasn't coping anymore at the moment. I was desperate, and couldn't avoid asking for help much longer. This manic depressive episode has lasted 6 months, I've lost 10 kilo in weight and I don't want to eat. Lots of triggers have contributed to this current downfall. Arguing with my hubby about not cheating on him (he suspects I have been, as I am psychotic and I have lost so much weight). He admits he is paranoid at times, I have to stress t
hrough no fault of his own. I can't deal with confrontations and arguing. Ironically, I usually have to shout at the top of my voice to defend myself as a human being (with a kind conscience and soul). Otherwise, I lie in my bedroom and ignore the disturbing issue. I have been instructed by Psychiatry that I have Borderline Personality Disorder. I am now fighting for a second opinion as I was told at therapy I did not need further counselling. I strongly disagree, I'd waited for a year to get an appointment, which anyone with pending mental health issues will understand is a struggle! This was another trigger, having my beliefs diminished that I needed further help. I have been told group therapy is my only option, I can't face that as life is overwhelming enough. I don't feel able to cope socially and have lost my faith that there are still kind people out there. The police officers were great, more helpful than psychiatry. They managed to get someone from mental health to speak to me within their visit and 
thankfully, the doctor will ring me this morning to ask more questions about my symptoms/Schizophrenia traits. The police lady could see I was very distressed, muddled and not coping mentally. She was so helpful in getting me some assistance. The doctor will ask a few more questions in the morning and discussed possibility of trying an antipsychotic, such as _PERSON_. I mentioned to him I'd been taking 3mg Buccastem (used from migraines, nausea and Schizophrenia). This is obviously a very small dose, but I double up if needs be and this has greatly helped with calming down the psychotic episodes, helping me to think straighter and not having conflicting voices telling me to kill myself and also thoughts of vengeance have decreased somewhat. The lady at NHS mental health then rang to follow up. She agreed Stemetil sounded effective, and 'good'. As usual, I have slipped through the net. However embarrassing this whole event may sound, I am glad I've stood my ground. The guy on the phone for NHS 111, was less th
an helpful (telling me what I didn't already know, and that there was no option but group therapy!). I proper had a go at him anyway - while frequently apologising! I'm sorry, but some people can't cope in a group, especially me!! I am pleased I am getting some promising help. I hope I feel better and moreso, 'like myself' soon. It is a shame how far you have to go to get a second opinion. It's mad to think that I got in my car the previous night, on all my medication and went on a frenzied drive to try and kill myself, no seatbelt. It's so amazing, the police helped me feel I can survive another day, even if just to wait for the psychiatry doctor to ring. I thanked them so much. It's a shame my other mental health doctors have let me down. Best Wishes to all and thanks for listening. x"

175955511,"A lot of people are curious as to what it feels like to live with bipolar disorder. Now, I am only speaking for myself because everyone’s case – his or her life – is different. Some people liken it to riding a roller coaster and, in a way, it is. It is fast. I have what is referred to as rapid cycling bipolar which means like a pin ball machine my moods clash around in all directions crossing paths with itself. Basically I go from full throttle to behind everyone else quite quickly – month to month, week to week, day to day, or hour to hour. I keep everyone on their toes. Back to the roller coaster, where are each of us going? Well, we are running a course of mood shifts (bipolar disorder is a mood disorder) from very high to very low. Sometimes it is fun, sometimes to the outsider it looks fun, but it is those fun times that wind people living with bipolar disorder in trouble. Those ‘fun’ times are in reference to mania or hypomania. During these phases or ‘episodes’ (what they cal
l them in the psychiatric world) a number of activities can occur. One person may be highly promiscuity, another may spend tons of money without a care in the world – we are all different. I, for example, like to climb up high – trees, three story houses – believing I can fly. But like a bad hangover, when come out of these episodes, we shake our head and deal with the what we have done while hypomanic or manic. Sometimes there is a lot of damage done. Relationships can be broken. Our bank accounts can be drained. I wonder what would have happed if I kept walking on that roof? Don’t get me wrong, it can feel amazing – that is actually a symptom. We experience a feeling of grandeur, like we are the center of everything interesting. We are interesting and talented and amazing and we want everyone to know. Sometimes we may even feel we are God. Oh, to feel that high all the time, amazing. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/03/31/what-does-it-feel-like/"

I'm wondering what type of meds might use for a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, and sleep aid. I'm on Geodon, Trileptal, and Remeron Curently. I'm thinking I might try Latuda for my AP, it helps with sleep and its easy on the weight like Geodon. I don't know, does anyone have any drugs that I should look up and research on my own before I see my Pdoc? Are there any new Mood stabilizer out there or should I stick to trileptal?

175955540,"Well when I didn't take my meds i thought the antinatalists were harboring a plot to kill everyone to end suffering, but that may just have been my imagination. Other possible delusionals are more normal: 1. I see people as predators who dominate each other and screw each other over to have power. But the antinatalists and the pessimists tend to agree with me, so that might be true. 2. I think people are jealous of me because I'm content with very little, that they think it's unfair to them that they bought into the faulty notion that hard work, success, money, marriage, kids, and consumerism buys happiness and then they turn around and see someone who has next to nothing being perfectly happy. So they try to bait me into drama and bombard me with criticism to the point where I lose the ability to talk and slip into ""voices."" But a misanthrope said people see her room and are envious of her alternative minimalism because they see it as a slap in the face to their normalcy rules, so strangely enou
gh, that might be true. 3. I see people as lacking in very basic logic, even my therapist. I told her, ""I don't feel in control of anything"" to which she rather glibly retorted, ""you're in control of your life."" Does she realize there may be no free will? Someone could drop a nuclear bomb in ten minutes. She said I'm in control of who I put myself around. Then we spent about two years going back and forth about being pressured to socialize at work. She was completely clueless about why I might not want to eat lunch with a coworker. Well? If I control who I put myself around, why would I want to socialize. Last week I wasted $35 on Uber to have her tell me that being a recluse is going to extremes. According to what metric? Society's. Society positions itself as ""balanced"" when to me it's extremely extroverted. If I control who I put myself around, then I don't want to be around anyone! So why can't I be a recluse? Don't even get me started on gender roles. But everyone thinks most people are stupid, so 
that might be true too. 4. I see people as despising me and wanting to change me to be more like them. I imagine that I just want a sensitive, soft, calm, intellectual discussion and because I'm eloquent and refined, I'm seen as a stuck up c-word. I think I'm pressured to dumb it down and be more emotional to get to people's not so secure level. I think I'm seen as a threat. But that's happened in the past, so that might be true. 5. I think because I'm black, I'm expected to be outgoing, sassy, extroverted, Christian/Muslim, social, and very emotional, especially about racism. But I have had people treat me like that, so it might be true. I think isolation is the only solution. I think people are too hostile and controlling. I feel like I would be living in Uganda-like place were in not for the police state and Big Brother, along with even normal people's tendency to be avoidant and perfunctory. I tried eating one meal a day because I thought it would be make antifragile instead of a fragilista. I thought I w
ould benefit from people's disrespect by losing weight. They would be helping me with their bullying in a way. I would be using it to my advantage. But it was too hard because people might pressure me to eat. It's about *them* and *their* wanting me to eat what they cook and be in my company instead of treating me like a separate individual with her own needs."

I don't know what to do but I can't afford to stop working there either. With everything so unorganised and out of place it only stresses me out more and of course with the loud noises of plates and stuff it get severely overwhelmed and anxious. I struggle to sleep because I'll be worrying about working there and i try tell my parents but they tell me to just think of the money like my mental health doesn't exist. I'm struggling I really am so if anyone has suggestions on how to cope I'm open to ideas."

175955565,"Thank you for the kind words and inspiration. I read your post dated November 27, and my jaw hit the floor! If there’s one person in this world I could say “I know how you feel” it’s you! Your post is basically a mirror image of my life in a nutshell. We sleep in separate spaces, my youngest will be out of the house the same time, the Parkinson’s issue, and other things. It sounds like your still having some sort of psychical contact with your husband, where as my wife has completely closed off any and all psychical contact with me. It’s been almost six years since we have been intimate and four years preceding that we’re sparse. A HUGE part in my life that I am missing is being loved. She has reduced me to believing that I am not worthy of being loved and it’s killing me. I tried depression medication but it’s not for me, makes me feel dumber than I already am.

It's clear to me what this is! even the very simple fact that it's able to talk back to me, is probably the biggest red flag there is in medical science, it's obviously a type of live stream or broadcast, and the real reason why I am alone or sent to Coventry so to speak, and put up with the festering hive public at times, trying to get through a wall of narcissistic stares and smartphones, avoiding the cameras. As you can publish anything about anybody upon them. Anyway, thank you for your very understanding reply, yes I have had my moments!

Her other husbands left her because of her extreme anger problems. She repeatedly warned me that she was far too hot-tempered to be married. I ignored that and insisted that all she needed was the right guy to help keep her calm. Why am I staying? Because I insisted that I was different from her previous husbands. That I wouldn't abandon her. That the right guy would soothe her nerves and keep her temper from rising and that I was that guy. That I love her unconditionally and that includes her temper. That really sounded good when I promised it to her over and over again. Little did I know what I was getting myself into."

175955582,"So, as a two-bit hack fraud writer, I've been looking for something to spark my interest to write about. I had a series from over a year ago, took me a year to write, roughly five hundred pages, maybe more, maybe less, but around there I'd argue. I wrote that, had a blast writing it, but came to the conclusion, around the end, ""My god... what will I do once I'm finished with this?!"" It was a sappy, science fiction romance/action novel. Gay romance. Yes yes. So, I came up with an alternate story, that I again, had a blast writing, but it was much shorter. Same main character, different universe, same names, similar personalities, wasn't an action story, it was a much darker story, but I had fun writing it. I went to the third series and never finished it because it was awful and I refuse to even acknowledge that it exists. What are you talking about? What third series? Then the fourth series, which quickly turned from a heterosexual love story to a story about politics in this galaxy that I create
d. Got deep into it, got bored, never finished. Then there were ten other series, same main character in terms of names. I've done music stories (sucked), I've done sports stories (hardly wrote anything), I've attempted sci fi action stories again (meh). I tried to do a post-apocalyptic story, and I got deeper into it than a lot of the other stories I never finished, but I ran out of ideas and had no idea how to end it. Now, after finishing my reread of The Fellowship of the Ring, I decided to do a fantasy story. Is it like Lord of the Rings? NOPE! I can't come close to _PERSON_ writing. I'm not even going to make an attempt. It was a book that I hadn't read in well over a decade, and all the reviews on Amazon were either ""BY GOLLY GOSH IT'S THE BESTEREST THING EVERER!"" or ""This is really boring. I loved the movies, but not the books."" Hogposh on the latter. That was the most entertaining book I've read in a long, long while. Sure, it wasn't as thrilling as _PERSON_, or as life-changing as _PERSON_, or as 
""when is something exciting going to happen? OH NOW! OH HOW EXCITING!"" as Sense and Sensibility, but it was wonderful. The world that man built is awe-inspiring, and the characters were all lovable. When the ring wraiths were chasing the hobbits, before they met Aragorn, that was the most tense I've felt reading a book in quite some time. _PERSON_ literally made me cry, but I wasn't tense during it. My story is some monster hunter story. Yes yes. I'm literally, like, six pages in, but I want to write it. I have a series of events planned out in my head, unlike the post-apocalyptic one, and i have an ending."

On one hand I'd like for everyone to know how disgusting his habits are, but then again I dont want everyone to think of that everytime they see me or gossip about it. I am a really shy and reserved Christian girl and the thoughts of anyone thinking about me or my body that way is honestly revolting. But, I'm proud to say I have told everyone that I felt needed to know. I told his grandmother that he is staying with since she started asking why I never came around anymore and was taking offense to my absence. I also told my other step brother since he has a wife and daughter now. And I'll continue to tell anyone I feel the need to. I dont wish to just freely share it, but I'm not saving him anymore by keeping silent. If I had it to do over, I would have screamed bloody murder and made a much bigger deal about it. I just thought that something that serious would be 
better dealt with by his dad. I still love him with all my heart and hope he is able to overcome this and become a better person. I was concerned about his mental health and wished he would agree to talk to someone. I think he started crushing on me when we were young and it progressed from there. I found porn history on my iPod he had beebeen using when we were 12. And after I caught him peeping, i tried googling about similar things and literally EVERYTHING was links to porn about incest. Maybe he got into watching that at a young age and it planted an unhealthy seed. I havent noticed him treating any other woman strangely. He has actually never had a girlfriend and doesnt seem into women or dating at all. It's all so strange, who knows what goes on in his head."

That one summer I ran 6km or so a day for 2-3 months. The main reason I first went to the doctor was for extreme agitation and depression. I was prescribed escitalopram and 120x 0.5mg clonazepams. If I was born in 1800's I would have been an inventor.. Without all the society expectations on how to be etc.. Mental health.. Little bit of madness is ok. Like _PERSON_. I would have fallen in love with a pigeon.

175955610,"[quote=""salles"" https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/01/extreme-coronavirus-lockdown-controls-raise-fears-for-worlds-poorest [/quote] I am now in total agreement with this. I just got back from buying food and supplies and because of store closures and the ######6 hoarders, I had to go to several places to get what I needed. People are not keeping their distance. It's not like the city where I live is the COVID-19 epicenter of the world or anything....oh, wait...yes it is. As this stretches on through the spring and possibly summer, those who don't get sick will start to get paranoid and frustrated. They're going to start lashing out at each other. It will be chaos. I hope. I say shoot 'em on sight. Better yet, use an air gun: less blood splatter. Wrap their bodies in plastic and drag 'em into the gutter for pickup."
175955611,I think too much. And I’m thinking about my last sort of ‘break’. I remember seeing skulls in traffic lights on my way to a job interview in end of July 2015. I didn’t see my doctor and admit my paranoid and delusional thoughts until May 2017. Makes me think how long was I really out of it and how long I lost insight.

175955613,Countdown begins for the first of February when I can test. I’ve quit drinking 2 days ago for good for now until this condition passes (which pregnancy I found out is considered a condition). Trying to stop the nicotine intake. Idk if I should ask my doc if I could Vape with 0 nic. 0 nic makes me cough tho. So maybe should just quit. I need to find an alternative relaxation technique that can replace nicotine. I’d have to google and perhaps talk to my pregnancy and ttc forum. Which I found one btw but it’s on an app. So it’s like not a forum like this. It’s an app community.

175955615,"You've been on the medicine 3 days. So it is having a chance to work. Glad you feel better. Sorry you had been living unstable for years. What was that like? What had they done, miss-diagnosed you as anxiety, then finally bipolar? You asked, ""What were your symptoms"" Symptoms of bipolar were, one was depressed. I would go into the psy. office as depressed, the psy, wouldn't say anything, he would just listen to me talk. See my as depressed, dx me as depressed. Wrong. Could have said, do you ever have any manic episodes? I was miss-diagnosed for about 15 years. Signs of my bipolar were: In manic phase, couldn't slow my mind down. Hard to concentrate at times but could occasionally stay on a task for a long time, probably obsessing. Would go until I had a collapse of some sort. One time I couldn't walk for a few hours, probably because of no socialization and obsessing on a project and not on any medicine such as anti-depressant or stabilizer such as Lithium. My mind just refused to keep going 100 
miles an hour. Laid in the ER for a few hours, socialization, then got up and walked out. Was put on anti-depressant alone, and with no stabilizer, the anti-depressant by itself would throw me into mania. Then I would have panic attacks. And the psy. wouldn't have a clue when I went back to see him again. You said, ""The Trazodone has me agitated, so every antidepressant has done this, ridiculous"" Yes, that is ridiculous. For the Trazadone anti-depressant, webmd.com says under side effects: ""This medication may increase serotonin and rarely cause a very serious condition called serotonin syndrome/toxicity. The risk increases if you are also taking other drugs that increase serotonin....(see Drug Interactions section). ""Get medical help right away if you develop some of the following symptoms: .... unusual agitation/restlessness."" Depakote (stabilizer): ""A small number of people who take anticonvulsants for any condition (such as seizure, bipolar disorder, pain) may experience depression, suicidal thought
s/attempts, or other mental/mood problems. Tell your doctor right away if you or your family/caregiver notice any unusual/sudden changes in your mood, thoughts, or behavior...."" What, a lot of anti-depressants raise the serotonin level, which seems to be the chemical which makes us feel good? What other anti-depressants have you taken?"

174342196,"The plot thickens. You say you have depression and adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. (You say you do not have bipolar, because you have none of the signs of that.) So you have depression and adhd. You say: : 1. I’ve been on antidepressants for 20 years. 2. I was going through a tough patch with my Drs help wanting to wean off. I believe my entire “episode” of having the feeling I was losing control was caused by a decrease in my meds at a way to rapid pace. 3. My Dr was attempting to assist me in getting off EffexorER (20 years usage) (drugs.com says Effexor ER is an antidepressant. 4. I was dropped pretty rapidly 5. while doing this, I found it counterproductive but, she had me on Seroquel (drugs.com says Seroquel is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar); Wellbutrin (bupropion) net says is an antidepressant; aripiprazole (net says Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic used to treat psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder and major depressive disorder. ) 
6. (to assist with the withdrawal. I literally lost my mind! 7. I would drive to the clinic yelling at the front desk staff to tell my Dr that she had to do something or I was going to lose my mind. 8. I’m also on Ativan (net says anti-anxiety) for anxiety 9. The Dr places me back on EffexorER (anti-depressant) added adderall (net says Adderall contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, central nervous system stimulants, that affect chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control. Adderall is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. 10. and Risperidone (net says is an antipsychotic medicine used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 11. I’ve not had any episodes since this one time and she stated that I show bipolar symptoms? 12. I’m just wondering if I should be getting a second opinion or if there’s a chance that I have it and the meds I’m on now are what I needed to balance me out. So, meds you ar
e on now are 1. EffexorER (anti-depressant). and she’s added 2. adderall (net says is an amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combination for hyperactivity) 3. And Ativan tranquilizer. Since the adderall is amphetamine and dextroamphetamine combined, I typed into the search engine “adderall adverse effects” and www.therecoveryvillage said: “Although most people who misuse Adderall (Amphetamine, Dextroamphetamine Mixed Salts) try to hide their drug habit, there are many signs of Adderall abuse and addiction that could give them away. These signs can range from changes in their mood and behavior, to the loss of a job or destroyed relationships. These signs all point to one thing - Adderall abuse. Addiction is a threat to a person’s health and happiness and drug treatment is needed as soon as possible.” adf.org. said: “Amphetamines are stimulant drugs, which means they speed up the messages travelling between the brain and the body. Some types of amphetamines are legally prescribed by doctors to treat 
conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (where a person has an uncontrollable urge to sleep). Amphetamines have also been used to treat Parkinson’s disease. Other types of amphetamines such as speed are produced and sold illegally. The more potent form is crystal methamphetamine (ice)."

I can't list everything. I'm freaking out a little because I feel judged by what I do and I keep sabotaging myself in the moment and have to deal with small things that keep piling

But I found I would get into this weird drowsy high state, i couldnt walk and felt so out of it. We switched to 300mg 4x and it works perfectly, occasionally I'll get the high feeling but a nap takes it right out or just wait 15-20 minutes.

175955697,"Hello to everyone on this thread , or people googling for answers with similar issues I’m 24, around 8 months ago I developed a similar issue, although slightly different to _PERSON_ and clemxiii. I will say I’ve always been an over thinker, and have had issues with anxiety (never taken anything for it). what I see is trails in my vision, almost as if my brain can’t process the movement as it could before... I noticeably lose focus in my day to day because of this, and I’m not sure if this is just major anxiety, but I constantly feel slightly dizzy and light headed as well. On top of that I just feel very uncomfortable in my head, because of this feeling, and it’s like a cycle of pressure that builds up because I focus too much on this weird feeling To give an example, if you watch a horror film, sometimes the camera will focus on one character close up... and then zoom out slowly. The character in the frame will not move, staying the same size, but everything around it slowly pulls back. 
Instead of things pulling back they slightly move left and right, as if I was on a large ship and it was rocking with the water. It’s at its worst point when I wake up on my side, or if I’m very tired at night... I thought it might’ve been vertigo, but I’ve seen many doctors, which all have said your deficient in vitamin D take 2000 units, or it’s just anxiety here’s Xanax... finally one recommended a neurologist, and he thinks it could be an electrical flare affecting the vision portion of my brain. I took the MRI on my brain, and still have to go for the follow up with the doctor to see the results... but it’s not like I have an aneurysm or tumor, because I don’t think they’d just let me walk out Iike that without informing me. Tomorrow morning I have an EEG which measures the electricity in the brain to see if there’s anything wrong with there. This feeling started when I was 11 years old, and went away after two weeks... I’ve disclosed my drug use to every doctor I’ve had and each 
have said I shouldn’t be feeling this way from any of them, and if so not for this long... the fact that I’ve felt this before reassures me a bit that it’s not from previous drug use. I’ve smoked a lot of pot from the ages of 17-22, I’ve done mushrooms 4 times, MDMA 8 times, acid twice with the second time being fake acid I believe since it had a metallic taste (25-I) But this condition started happening over a year after my last ‘mind altering’ substance Since this started again I have been working out everyday, eating a very well balanced diet, taking vitamins daily, trying to think positively, and consuming positive material... I quit playing video games, cut tv use to just an hour or two at most a day of any tv at all... and started trying to paint, learn instruments... basically forcing myself to do so much I don’t have a chance to think in the moment about how I feel, and by the time I do I’m exhausted and pass out to bed The weird thing is the only time I feel completely normal, is in 
my dreams. So if you guys are still experiencing this issue, there are more out there feeling similar, or worse... which can be relieving I guess... try to constantly be positive, it’s an active process and maybe meditation to give your mind time to soothe itself from negative thoughts surrounding this issue. Everyday is a blessing, and just having the cognitive ability to even write this is something I’m grateful for."

Her job is very stressful too. She is just so unhappy with her life & it worries me a lot. Her Dr prescribed Prozac in April, but she did not start it. She is going to start today- what are your experiences on Prozac?"

175955706,There are some meds like benzos that have the potential to kill you when mixed with alcohol. Others like APs just magnify the effects so one drink can make you drunk.
175955707,I have a delusion that an unknown force wants to kill either me or my mom. That one of us has to die. I think it's cuz of the great imbalances between our near death experiences.
175955708,Do you need a down payment for the manufactured home?
175955709,My mind has been all over the place and my mood I notice has been up. But I also find myself slipping backwards with my hygiene. It was getting bad before months ago where I was going a week or two weeks without showering. I’ve been showering twice a week this past while. And sometimes that feels like a struggle. Sometimes I just sleep in my clothes because I can’t be bothered to change out of them for the night. I feel almost obsessive about things with my thoughts but also paralyzed. It’s a constant feeling.

I was talking to Pastor _PERSON_ on Monday night and I was telling him how when I was at the hospital there was vapors rising up from the curtains. He was like, you must have been really stressed.

175955719,Morning My Np won’t let me go down on my AP. I’m not having much of any voices anymore and no delusional ideas right now. I need to explain that to him when I see him. I’m not as afraid of COVID since my dad is ok and wearing masks and stuff even tho fiancé isn’t... But I’m starting to leave the house from time to time and my anxiety has gone down
174342336,"After all the years of struggling with severe anhedonia, many things have happened since then. I believe it was caused by environment factors (But your dad has schizophrenia.. On the other hand, don't give up. I didn't give up. I kept researching constantly trying to find everything under the sun that would make me better - 50 different chemicals, spirituality, life experiences, support from friends and family - It's all needed) so it can be fixed by environmental factors. I didn't realize that it was environmental factors and of course it was genetics too and/because why didn't it happen to anyone else with the same environmental factors? What I know is that most people in Ireland seemed to be a ""feeling"" type of personality. I was molded into ""thinking"". Probably that has nothing to do with anything but I'm good at piecing all of these things together as time goes on.. The more you know and with creativity, I can explain it better. Think about your whole life constantly and try to remember th
ings that happened. Use the ""windows"" of anhedonia to think about the past and feel those emotions - All the imagery of pictures in your mind (Which I find to be a form of controlled hallucinating). It was my thing to try and figure it out (Even though I still get anhedonia when I withdraw from phenibut). But what I've noticed is that - By feeling that way (By having a lack of feeling), it's ok. I always hope that it will get better. You see why people with bipolar don't realize that they're depressed when they're in depression and some of them end up committing suicide. The brain in the current state says ""I'm gonna be like this forever"". That's how bad trips happen. Psychedelic trips last for 6-12 hours and I've felt the most euphoric possible and the most dysphoric as completely possible. Nothing could feel as good and as bad as those trips. I don't recommend it. I really don't (Only when there's research and clinics where you can walk in, have a guided trip and then walk out looking at the flowers at 
the front door..). I'm not really afraid of pain anymore. I'm ready for complete hell because at least it's ""feeling something"". Not many people would say that if they haven't been through anhedonia. It could have been from my depression and not schizophrenia which was likely. Sometimes depression means not feeling anything at all.. Instead of those melancholy type sadness that people get to be able to write good songs, poems, art, make good music. Anhedonia is really one of the worst things. I would hate to feel anxiety or dissociation but that basically means that I'm not ""all there"". What I mean is to be fully there.. Not feeling anything. I was always afraid of what people think of me when I'm in a bad state but the best thing to do is talk about it with people that don't judge and have acceptance. Being in anxiety states, pain or not feeling anything - You have to have some sort of hope - Otherwise, what's the point? You let what it could be become non-existent in exchange for giving up. You're doing 
a lot of things. Working, writing your books, studying philosophy (Interesting thinkings), having time to relax with a beer or so, finding a partner, etc etc... It's all crazy stuff when you really think about it.. You have a dying passion for life from that crystalized mindset of what it used to be nonetheless and that will get you through it. That's all you need =]"

175955722,no i did not get insomnia -and i have suffered world class cases of insomnia in the past . in fact if i took a large dose of 15 mg -i would have to lie down and take a long nap. only took the 15 mg dose a few times -mostly to see what it would do. 5 mg was a usual dose for me and took 10 if really anxious or bad day. keep us posted on your results

175955724,It is
175955725,I have too much empathy for the worlds' suffering
175955726,"Lol, not sure if watching that made me feel better or feel even worse. I just don't want to live with the pain of the past.... but I don't want to die before being apart of an interesting future. I just don't want to lose my love ones in the process. I want them live and die along side of me. Not years and decades apart. But given the time and space... you basically do die along side of friends and family. A person who lives 100 years with people they meet and love within that 100 years basically dies along side of their love ones in a span of 100 years given how old the universe is and up until the universe is nothing."
175955727,"Eh, It's alright. Waiting on their dad to come back."
175955728,It’s really no worse than the thirties.....now fifties is rough....
175955729,I'm not quite sure how my anhedonia 90% went away. I did experiment with ~50 different chemicals. I don't recommend. I still take phenibut due to apathy. I'm slowly getting off of it though.
175955730,"Ok, then you misunderstood or I wasn't clear. When did I say they didn't find any evidence? When did I say in my reasoning for suggesting it could be worth further examining ""their ideas because they felt strongly enough about it that it warranted lying?"" I thought I was just pointing out reasonings behind why some researchers are unethical. I thought I also said that there have been times where research has benefited us greatly even though it was done unethically. Pointing out a fact of life isn't the same as approval. For that matter, when did I even say I agreed with them that it does things like cause ASD? I was half playing devil's advocate which I thought would be evident in my mention that the numbers of people with ASD are unlikely to have gone up (increased spectrum for DX as mentioned) and the fact that I said I'm grateful for the flu shot because it makes a huge difference for me. That being said, I do go back to saying it doesn't mean they could have been onto some type of flaws And, 
why did it bother you that I mentioned it could be worth it, if you're pro asking questions and seeking answers? Yes. It's possible. It's also possible there would be other findings. Saying these things isn't the same as saying that fabricating results is ok. Did you read the example I gave for this in the standards of reliability part of my post? You still haven't explained how I'm doing this? Look at the other questions I posed in my last reply to you. I'm not arguing that it was partially fabricated. Again, I gave an example in my mention of reliability I'm perceiving you to have an incongruent opinion when you also say I'm ""making up excuses for fraudsters to give them the benefit of the doubt"" Is it possible this topic is triggering for you and you've instantly disagreed with me rather than actually paying attention to what I was saying? Not that I care about that in particular. In both your comments to me, you're dismissing things I didn't say, so I'm making sure clarify."

175955733,"You need water. Flowing. Sit by a river. My veins are big.. warm hands.. Am I gonna die? Maybe. Maybe not. I should watch Netflix and chill. But I need a benzo to chill. I was about to buy Soma but last second changed my mind. Just thoughts. All they are is thoughts. My heart is beating nicely because of the beta blocker. I'm glad that I can take a stimulant with it. Sometimes we just need to relax and stop thinking about certain things. Ashwagandha allows me to do this.. But enough of the chemicals... I talk about them too much. But we are chemicals. Energy (Angels or demons - Which ever you want to call them) is us. Catch the thought of death and let it be - Let you be. Make small steps (Minimum 1% attempt) to change every day.. That gives hope of getting better - Next thing you know, non free will takes over for you and you're in the flow of water doing 10% change a day without even trying."

175955735,"Took one this morning. I find having a reason to get out of bed helps me get into the shower. Lately, this may be stupid, but that reason has been breakfast. I really have been enjoying my breakfasts, so instead of ignoring my alarm and sleeping all day I get right up, eat, take my meds, and shower."
175955736,"Trying to study but all I can think about is my crocheting project. I've been working on a blanket forever and keep having to put stripes because colors get discontinued.

Hopefully, I won't need to buy anymore but never know. My exam for this course is April 11th, then I have two more courses to start in May.

175955740,I see my psychiatrist on Wednesday on some sort of telehealth platform. I'm more worried about the technology than I am the appointment. It's not one I've used before so I don't know how it will work. Kind of worried about it. I talk to my Pastor T tonight. I don't wanna. But I can't really cancel either. So I gotta suck it up and take the telehealth call. We do _PERSON_. But it's hard to have a quiet private place away from my parents. I tried going to the RV last week but the WIFI wasn't good or something and didn't let me connect to _PERSON_. So my Dad has a hot spot or something that I'm going to try this week and see if that works. I'll be glad when COVID is over and we can go back to face to face.

Hell yes"".."
175955753,"Think about how you felt before you went on the meds. If you are feeling better than that, then something is helping. Therapy is such a huge help, but yes, it does take time. Time to get to know your therapist sometimes, and sometimes they have to get to know you too. Get a little insight. For awhile, I couldn't relax and be happy. Enjoy what was going on at the time. I was always feeling like the rug would be pulled out from under me if I relaxed and let my guard down. I think it just takes practice. Anxiety keeps a lot of us from enjoying life. Take it one day at a time. Try to enjoy the moment. Even if you have to go moment to moment. It is all worth it. It does sound like you are thinking with optimism. So I bet things really are getting better. It often takes a while to recognize it. Hugs, _NAME_..."

But in that case, of course I would stay away from people, if I were contagious. But mental health issues are not contagious. That's why it's weird.

175955776,"Dear searching, we sound allot alike. I have been miserably ill for the past three or four months. Hair loss, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, constipation, tender sore throat, hoarse voice, sore ears and cold. I have been running to the nurse practitioner who does very little. She has branded me “Chronic” like a scarlet letter. Finally in a moment of clarity a week ago I thought, “maybe I should check my meds?”....I was so sick and desperate to figure it out too. Guess what? My meds were mixed up! Back in Nov I had asked her to fill my nortriptyline as I was having pain that was keeping me awake.....she filled it wrong, with amitriptyline. I don’t take amitriptyline. Put them on a shelf and forgot about them, ....they look the same as my synthroid....so in Feb when I went to get my synthroid for my pill box I mixed them up! I was taking no thyroid meds but was taking amitriptyline. What a bloody mess. Never in thirty years has this happened to me. Taking the wrong meds...justdoesn’t happen. 
Thus all the symptoms. Fixed the issue but began with terrible muscle cramping. Ended up at the ER the other night where they found my CK enzyemes to be really high. Creatinine kinease or something, a by product of muscle wasting and kidney issues.... Was referred to an endocrinologist and was told it would be several weeks, eight....before they could retest my TSH levels and before I’d feel better.....crazy story....moerto come I’m sure but it goes to show you that even in our darkest hours we know more about our body than they do. Keep fighting, use the ER if it gets too bad though. Feel better soon. _PERSON_"

I basically told her not to overload herself because big corporations say they care about employees but we’re all replaceable in the long run. Don’t drive yourself crazy for your job. And I mean it. My last job I stressed about and it’s part of why I went into psychosis. Going crazy for a job ain’t worth it. I was working too hard and caring about the company far more than the company cared about me and that stress broke me. I care about my current job a lot but I’m not going to let it drive me crazy.

174342451,"I have bipolar, severe anxiety, and now I’ve been diagnosed as schizophrenic (so I guess technically schizoaffective) But my bipolar has been pretty well controlled. As I write this I am actually feeling pretty decent. No hallucinations or delusions and my thoughts seem semi clear. Though if I went somewhere I tend to believe that everyone is staring at me or giving me dirty looks and laughing behind my back or going to purposely run me over with their car, etc. I have some mild visual hallucinations some days. And sometimes I will be outside and start slapping myself all over because I’m convinced I can feel bugs all over me. I am also convinced there are fingerprints on my car and someone has been touching it. I am nearly obsessed about that. I tend to get worse by night. Then my thoughts get all jumbled and for some reason I get severely agitated and angry because of it. And I didn’t used to be an angry person. I also start randomly spacing out and just staring at the same thing for a minu
te or so but seem to have no thoughts in my head at all. Then other times I get overwhelmed with the thoughts. I almost feel like I’m going into another dimension and I’ll never come back and it disturbs me. I am going to try taking my medication earlier in the evening so I am covered for the evening because that seems to be my worst time. I just can’t think anything through anymore. I sometimes almost feel like I’m not “there” entirely. I know my medication helps but I’m experimenting as to exactly what time to take it. Is all of this normal?

The inability to observe such a collapse directly has given rise to different interpretations of quantum mechanics and poses a key set of questions that each interpretation must answer."" _NAME_ said that he's immune to paranoia. He took a looot of psychedelics. I don't get it. I don't know whether or not I should be paranoid. The news always tries to scare us. _PERSON_? really? Is this the 2020 scare now with WW3?

175955795,Ok. That too. I agree. But I needed to say my last post because I get a lot of questions about my health for different reasons and I wanted to put my physical health in one post too. And I just realized how much physical shyt is wrong with me and its depressing.

175955822,My (ex)Boyfriend has rapid cycling bipolar and we have been dating for about 6 months now.. we were in a really happy state but last week he went through a severe depressive episode which I didn't know about because he basically ghosted me. We met for dinner on Tuesday and I cried a lot saying that I was confused and didnt know what was going on.. he explained to me that he was so depressed he couldnt get off the couch. I said I would try to be more understanding and dinner seemed to be going ok until he admitted to me out of the blue that his ex girlfriend of 4 years sent him an email saying its hard for her to accept him being with someone else and that she misses him etc. I didnt know why he was telling me this but I was understandably upset .. I asked him if he wanted to stay with me that night because I missed him so much then he said he didnt have his meds so he couldnt which I understood so I thought we were fine when he left. Then he started texting me a few hours later asking him why I didn
t invite him over this weekend and that I was lying to him and going somewhere I didnt want him to know and started making some pretty intense accusations. Then he broke up with be the next day via text saying our differences were too much.. I havent spoken to him since (it was about 4 days ago) he hasnt reached out. I'm extremely confused and heartbroken -should I just move on? Will he contact me again? I love him so much..
175955823,"Sometimes just waiting for them to call you won't help you get it faster. Here in our state someone has a facebook group on just locating shots. It has helped so many find one. One thing you can do is call local pharmacy's and ask to be on a waitlist. They can give you shots that someone didn't show up for or leftovers etc. Look at all the places that are offering the shot, walmart, cvs etc. and see if they have a sign up list. They do often and aren't the type of place that calls you to offer a shot, you have to sign up for it yourself."

175955826,Hi. Welcome to the forum as you can see you will find good support here from others who can relate to what you are going through so you are not alone on this. I have bad health anxiety and it’s a tough one to deal with but I found that talking therapy helped so I would suggest you look into getting a therapist. The main thing to remember with health anxiety is to not use Dr _PERSON_ as that will only help fuel your anxiety. Have a look at our resources section for some good links to self help sites. _PERSON_

175955832,"Surely truth, or at least the search for truth, is the only way to rational, non-deluded contentment. You could argue that schizoid people value comfort over truth. I'm quite content with what I have, and I can't just ""decide"" to believe something just because it makes me feel better. How do people do that? How do they turn off the voice that screams ""this is obviously bollocks"" when you decide that believing in the tooth fairy would make you happier? To an extent, I admire people who can. Going through life with the idea that nothing really matters because Jesus will sort it out when you die must be great, but how they do that to the point where they'll accept it and defend it as ""real""? It's beyond me. In the sadism thread there's a discussion about serial killers. Their mentality provides them comfort over truth. I'd imagine that most people would agree that truth is more important."

There's different strains (White strain is more stimulating, red strain is more relaxing and green strain is in between). I have all 3 different strains and only tried the red strain so far. But I don't feel the effects of opiates/opioids. Just relaxation, calmness, meditativeness. I took 5g before my job resume appointment in half an hour."

175955837,"As I grew older I can see my mom in a new perspective, like in my case she doesn’t look like a super human anymore but a human with flaws even though she’s still wonderful in my eyes (she never abuses me unlike my dad). There are times now when I’m the one who takes her of her, emotionally or physically but it’s nice because she always tells me that she appreciates it and never guilt trip me when I can’t. So yeah I think as we grow older we have a more realistic view about our parents. We’re adults now just like they are. But with all due respect, your mom is toxic. I wouldn’t say that you have no common sense, I think you do have a common sense. To me it seems that you’re just confused sometimes about the image of her that you should have in your mind. “She’s histrionics, no but she takes care of me”, which is not unusual in victims of abuse. I think leaving her and move in with your brother is worth a try. Just my two cents."

175955841,"My understanding is that Bi polar comes in cycles. For example you can have periods of mania then periods of depression with some normal times in between. These cycles can last for days, weeks or evens months at a time. It's been a long time since I've had an actual mood cycle that last for days or weeks at a time. on average my mood tends to fluctuate daily. Some depression some irritability sometimes mild impulsiveness and some mild anxiety. I guess this is my baseline mood. I don't seem to have classic bi polar symptoms but am diagnosed with Bi polar 2. My questions is, does anyone else here experiencing daily mood shifts like I do. If so is this typical for bi polar particularly bi polar 2. Could this just be my baseline mood? I've been like this before starting meds and during. I've discussed this with my psychiatrist and he say's it's rare that someone would have daily mood shifts compared to classic bi polar cycles. The questions is are we dealing with bi polar or something else. For example 
life stressors that are contributing to my mood. Possibly ADHD. he didn't seem quite sure but seems more concerned with keeping my depression and hypomania level. Just trying to make sense of this condition outside of the textbook symptoms. Thank you very much."

174342544,Possible trigger: I’m trying to think about what to talk to my doctor about next time I see him and I’m debating if I should tell him that I’ve had thoughts before about stabbing people or shooting people. These thoughts disturbed me but luckily I haven’t had them in a while and I’m in no danger of actually carrying them out. I was at the mall the other day as well and had the thought to jump over the railing on the second floor. It disturbed me and I had to walk away from the railing. I have the thought that I can’t be trusted to have a balcony if I move to an apartment. I’m okay now but these are past thoughts and they probably fall in line more with my OCD than my psychotic disorder. They scare the **** out of me. I’ve never told anyone about them before and honestly even typing them out worries me. But I believe you guys to understand and won’t judge me.

They only were for like a year or so when I was sick. But my voices have mainly always been people mumbling. Usually mens voices mumbling. Like a radio station is on, like the sports station. It's like listening to ESPN sports from another room. Idk why. At least lately since I've been in recovery the past 4 years or so. It doesnt really bother me, it just signals to me that something isnt ok. I'm stressed right now too with having to find 600 dollars somewhere for this pet deposit.

175955855,"Being kind to yourself and ensuring that you are setting yourself up for success each day becomes even more important when you are living with extra challenges such as bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses. Life is hard enough to navigate when you are fighting your mind, so it’s important that you are proactive in doing all that you can to support yourself. From my own experience, these are some of the things that I have learnt can really help to get prepared for the day ahead, even when you are going through a tough time: Eating well While having a good diet is not going to solve all of your problems by any means, ensuring that you are getting the right nutrition for your mind and body to function at their best, is a great way that you can really help to set yourself up for success. This isn’t always easy especially if you’re not in a stable state of mind, but trying your best to do this, even if only in small ways like making sure you eat one piece of fruit each day is a small victory. 
Asking for help to ensure that you are eating well is something that can be really beneficial if you don’t feel up to planning, shopping or cooking yourself. Something that myself and my husband do is food prep when I am feeling good, which I find really helpful because it means that I have healthy meals there ready to just heat up. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-journey/2019/10/setting-yourself-up-for-success-despite-bipolar-disorder/"

175955890,"_NAME_ said... I was wondering if you were dependent on her for some reason, like finances. Well, I make my own money but she has complete control over it especially with her being my supervisor. _NAME_ said... I think what’s key is, can you hold a job so that you can pay your rent and food bills? If you can finance yourself, you stand a better chance to get away. But you’re saying, you can’t really get away to apply for a job, for you have to account for every second as to where you are. Can you locate a job on the net somehow, get away for an hour or two to apply for it? If you got the job, would you be able to quit your present job, leave your marriage, and start working the job? I'm not sure if this is a step that I was prepared to take. I came here looking for help in dealing with her rages and your recommendation is to throw in the towel and give up on the marriage. Maybe, ULTIMATELY, that MIGHT be the path that I take but I was first hoping some way of remaining in the marriage and may
be curbing her temper. _NAME_ said... You did say in your first post: “My wife, by her own admission, has ""a temper so violent that she can easily kill someone in her rage."" So your life is actually in danger here. This is not a fanciful situation. A borderline personality syndrome person, which in my amateur opinion I think she may very well be, is capable, as she has said herself, along with her saying she can’t improve. She put her third husband in the hospital, was arrested and ordered to seek professional help for her violence. That is why she is seeing this psychiatrist. It was either seek professional help or go to prison. She isn't really into it and neither is he. She's doing it to stay out of jail and he is ""treating"" her just to be paid. She can say that she IS under professional treatment like the judge ordered and he can say that he perscribed the proper medication needed to treat her violence. In the mean time, she flares up too quickly BEFORE being able to take her medication and her vi
olence is as prevalent as ever. _NAME_ said... And the person she attacks when she gets mad enough to kill, will be someone who lives in the apartment because that’s where her anger erupts and because there will be no witnesses. And the person she kills will be a whimp, unlike the first 3 husbands who manned up and left. Some of these people you read about and on TV doing serious crimes, are borderlines. Not to mention the psychological damage, and the physical when she throws a chair at you, broken bones, concussions. I think you really need to get physically away from her. And it’s not just a fanciful situation. You are in serious danger. When she gets into her moods, I do leave. I sleep in the garage or in the car. I drive a few blocks away and sleep there for several hours. Sometimes she does use me as a punching bag leaving me black and blue but most of the time I can recognize when a rage os coming over her and am able to get away."
174342603,"I am doing all right. I wish I had a little more energy for all the things I need & want to do. I did some reading this morning about equilibrium in the human body, because I've been doing a lot of thinking about how everything seems to seek this special balance, & if it isn't there, things seem to not function as well. For instance, if we are all work & no play, we can end up with an illness of some sort, physical or mental, or both. So anyway, I sense this need in myself for balance, for physical, mental, & spiritual things, things for general health & for the spirit."

175955928,"Feeling better this morning. Had the craziest good dreams. At first I was in a church of Satan. I told a high school friend about my mental illness - I said that it's no big deal. I was watching a movie where i started climbing through the walls with blocks of plastic and each plastic box, you could see through it - something about the self until you were looking back in. I tried to get back in and everyone was giving each other hugs. I spent about half an hour of a dream sitting in a normal church. I finally was ok being there without judgement. There was a shaman priest. We were singing and a friend beside me was looking at my macbook - I played a tune that reminded me of childhood. For some reason it played ""Living in the moment"". My friend took a psilocybin capsule from my med box. I was running through hallways because an alarm sound went off - It was in a hotel. I got scared and took a diazepam in my dreams."
175955929,I turned off all notifications on my phone. I feel like they make me anxious and unfocused on what I'm doing in any given moment. I think it's a good thing for me to simplify things.

175955932,"I'm a ""tea""-totaler, and drink tea all day long. I drink good tea that I buy through online shops. One of my favorites this year is from the country _NAME_, made by ""Renegade Tea Farmers"" who started working the tea farms abandoned 30 years ago after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. You can read their story at their web site: https://www.renegadetea.com Tea has less caffeine and does not make me jumpy and jittery the way coffee does. It also has the amino acid L-theanine, which causes ""relaxed alertness"" by increasing the brain's alpha waves."
175955933,"April of this past year marked the seventh anniversary of my dad's passing. He died April 1st 2013. April Fools Day, in Hospice, from cancer. He had only just turned 54 less than a month prior. He was a father of two adult children. Divorced and remarried. He had 3 grandchildren through that union. He was starting the process of becoming a foster parent for crisis situations. A safe house. He played the acoustic guitar. Was a water color artist. He loved history. He was quiet and reserved yet he and could spend 5 hours on the phone together. He and my mom had my when they were 19. There was never a moment in my 34 years with him that I did not feel loved and encouraged and like the most important person in his world to him. A machinist. Homemade handyman. He planted over 200 blueberry bushes for a blueberry farm. We raised chickens. He loved to fish. He did not like to hunt. We always had cats and thanks to my dad, we got a dog. He loved being outside and enjoying God's earth. He loved to hike and 
explore. My dad was my hero and my everything. Over seven years later...it is not any easier. I miss him every moment of every day."

175955936,"My 19 year old son is a college sophomore. Attending college virtually due to Covid is not going well. His grades are OK but he says he feels depressed and disconnected. He had a tough time in high school and has no friends locally. He saw a psychiatrist and took meds in high school but does not want to go that route again. I am worried because he talks a lot about a friend of a friend committing suicide and says some days he sees little or no reason to get out of bed. He does, because he is determined and hard working, but he is very down. Any suggestions? Thank you."
175955937,"To focus, I need a change of scenery - Rooms where I have a desk, places to go and just think or listen to podcasts, being able to go outside and feel warm, supportive friends that like to work on themselves and don't go to parties and get blackout drunk or stoned every other night or make drama, a part time job that I like where I can save money.. I need lots of recreation so I can think about things that help my soul so I can feel comfortable about those things while focusing. I want to feel safe and secure in my environment. I need to have the perfect meds and be satisfied and not have to think about them anymore. My dad is coming to visit at the end of the month. I'm so lucky that he survived cancer. He's like a shaman to me. I think he's an INFJ or something.. He tells me things about myself and is good at guiding me. He was there for me when I was in the basement, suffering abuse and madness. We'd talk on the phone for hours while I'd pase, walking around looking at the kitchen tiles and maki
ng patterns with my feet. There's so many people that I meet that are like that. They understand. I just need to know that things will be ok. I feel alone with my thoughts and lost. I've never felt this aware. I was asleep for most of my life. I used to just let things happen. I still kind of do. It's a curse to not take control. I always let myself go out of control."

174342660,"I am doing ok. I get demands from my students though. They want more time and attention etc. I have to address these issues because customer satisfaction is everything. So, I spend my time trying to figure out how to meet their demands. I'm doing fine otherwise. I am not making much but am doing ok and can still eat out once a week at least. I am happy!! I decided to stay by myself instead of meeting more strangers for dates. I had a gut feeling that it is better for me to focus on my work and do my best. I work six days a week and am tired most of the time but do rest on my break time. I am still taking my medication daily and now drink a cup of coffee during my break time to give me some pep. I feel fine. The weather is horrible here but am cool inside with the air conditioner on. I am doing well and better than before. I want to become independent for good so want to make this a reality. I think my doctor back home realized I had potential and never allowed me to go on disability. I am glad I di
d not because it would have robbed my motivation to work. I like working but don't like the stress at times. I want to stay here indefinitely if possible. For me to do this, I will have to work hard. I'm only working about 20 hours a week but want to work about 25 hours a week. I thought 20 hours a week was my limit but now that I am doing this, I realize I can do more hours per week. So, I am satisfied with my life but need to focus on taking care of myself and work."
175955940,"The standard spiel about schizoid/avoidant types is we prefer our own company and dont like other people. But is this always true? For me its not. I like people, but i dont like how i feel when i'm around them - awkward, uncomfortable, self conscious, drained. Its also why i like vicarious activities like reading fiction, watching movies, playing video games. ""I"" am not present in these things - i get to read/see interesting people doing interesting things without me present to screw it up."

This certification is all on this lady's time. Itll be a webcam course with her. Well she had a death in the family this week. So now my boss has asked me if I could move in earlier to my place. She said she would help us move if we need her. It's very close, so now I'm scrambling asking these 2 apts if I can move in earlier. I wont know til monday. And i gotta reschedule my electric, internet, etc everything else, in order to move. Its stuff like this that stresses me. It's just another thing on my plate, on top of the literal 10 other things I have to do."

I have enough Navy red sos for tomorrow's breakfast Next time I need to get a bigger can of diced tomatoes. I kind of went on a shopping spree last night. I got more vitamins, an _NAME_ Press edition of Goethe's Faust for 22 bucks, a steal. It has a translation of faust I haven't read. I got another pair of headphones. I make sure I always have 2 pairs because they get lost or break at work. Work without headphones = hell. They're cheap though, relatively. I also finally bought Camus' The Plague, the last book on my to do list this crisis. That will be all my spending, after that it's me saving up for the rest of the time. I need to get one med, but that's it."

175955948,Hey there! I definitely understand what you’re going through I feel that so much it’s so tough! Have you tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy before? This one has really helped me whenever I have those negative thoughts about myself and I write them down and try to come up with every reason as to why they’re not true it has really helped me! My therapist recommended this book it’s called “Feeling Good” by _NAME_ I highly recommend reading this one it really has helped me a lot with my depression and anxiety! Hope you feel better soon! Keep fighting and stay strong!
175955949,Now I kind of feel I shouldn't have said anything. My mom asked me how many times I washed my hands so far today and looked sad. I can't help it! Ugh. I gotta study all day today and all morning tomorrow. Exam tomorrow afternoon. Nervous.
175955950,"Hello all. As I mentioned in a previous post, I am taking (generic) Zoloft. I was on 50 mg but recently increased to 75 mg. I guess I have been on the Zoloft around 6 weeks now. Something like that. When I wake up in the morning, I feel sort of jittery or agitated. It feels like I had too much caffeine (even though I had none at all). This feeling is uncomfortable and makes it impossible for me to sleep in when I would like to do so. It is less bad than it was at the outset, but still happens every day. I wonder if this side effect might be a permanent one? Anyone else experience this? Anything you did that helped to ameliorate it? I know I could try a different medication, but I really don't have it in me to stop this and deal with the start-up side effects of something else."
175955951,"Update, I was not thinking of the symptoms today as much as I did yesterday but the thoughts are still there, and my sleep was not good last night either. Actually there is something that I forgot to mention. I notice that my anxiety and panic attacks got worse after I had a course of accutane for my acne. To be honest my acne was not that bad (no scars or deep damage to skin) but It was not manageable either and it caused me to have a low self-esteem (I tried other oral and topical medication for it but they did not work). So I just chose to try the accutane even tho I was aware that this med can ruin your mental health. True it was doing great for my skin but I could not even take the medication for longer than 6 months as the doc recommended due to the side effects. It's been months since I get off that medication but my anxiety and paranoid thinking is still there! Somebody said... ...and for now keep up with your coping skills, and seek to learn some new ones! In our Resources at the top of th
e main forum page here, you'll find great material and links specifically for challenges with Health Anxiety, which I think could help you a lot. Thank you for reminding me of the anxiety sources. I need to check them out, and I will try to find other coping strategies that I can use until I get the therapy."

175955970,"As usual 7 days away from my period and my anxiety ramps up to 11. I have been having all kinds of on and off symptoms for what feels like forever. My most consistent and recent (2019) symptoms are: on/off sore throat (nothing found through 2 different ENTs), extreme fatigue, soreness in roof of mouth, achy lymph nodes under ears in neck, digestive issues. I am trying a new dosage of Armour Thyroid for my hypothyroidism, but it doesn't seem to be helping much- my fatigue is awful, I'm still cold frequently, and am experiencing tummy troubles. I'm so tired of feeling some form of sickness so often. I track my symptoms and it's daunting to see how often every week I am experiencing something or other that keeps me from feeling like a normal person! I saw a gastro doc and am to have an EGD on Friday - which I am very nervous about . And am having another sonogram of my neck to check on my thyroid and lymph nodes next week. So, I am doing things to keep up with making sure I'm ok, but I know that no ma
tter what is or isn't found, I do not FEEL ok. I feel awful. I wish I knew what to do! I wish someone could just tell me, ""Oh, all you need to do is take this medicine and follow this diet and you'll feel all better."" But it isn't that simple and I don't know what the answer is.

175955975,"Hello! Apologies in advance for chaotic message I am 25 y/o, never been in a relationship, I am an extreme introvert, don’t like to socialise for a long period of time unless it’s my sister (I live with her and we do almost everything together) I have become aware of my personality disorder, however what’s weird to me is that 5 years ago I wasn’t like this. I have long history of eating disorder. I have social anxiety that doesn’t allow me to live my life/work/do things that other enjoy. I tend to have/used to have suicidal thoughts and I know that I am not made for live normal life eg being in a relationship/ have family/ even things like going on holiday/ doing something nice for myself doesn’t excite me. I have no need for an excitement. I don’t see purpose in living. I survive day after day but it’s draining. I have episodes of mental breakdowns. I have mood swings. My disorder holds me back from getting a proper job, the best option for me is to work from home and do not have a 
need to be with others. I am aware that 5 years ago I wasn’t like that. Maybe not to this point. There are some behaviours of mine that I can not comprehend. I am extremely possessive of my sister and quite controlling. Whenever she goes out I am not able to function properly, especially when she goes on a date. I try to do everything to destroy her potential relationships as I don’t want to be left alone. I need help, can’t live like this, sooner or later my sister will leave and I need to somehow get a grip otherwise my disorder will destroy me."

Keep an open mind and do what the doctor suggests. This is probably their way to narrow things down. I hope that the dizziness goes away. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175956002,"Hi Mountainside, You have gone through a lot, but I know you are not a coward. There is a strong, vibrant woman inside of you and with her help you can get through this! Now, I am not any sort of healthcare professional, I'm just an old lady that has seen a lot so I have some advice for you but first a little about me. I am 74 and suffer a severe autoimmune disease, systemic scleroderma to be exact and so I know all about physical pain, loneliness and depression. My Scleroderma doesn't have many outward signs, the damage is mostly internal and friends would look at me and say that I wasn't sick. My hubby was partially physically disabled and had Alzheimer's disease. I was his caregiver for 10 years, taking care of his physical needs while I watched him decline mentally to the point that the man I married just wasn't there anymore. He passed away a couple of months ago after 52 years of marriage. I have had many times when I was in so much physical pain that I just didn't want to move, but I had no 
choice, he needed constant care and attention. The mental and emotional stress nearly broke me many times as I watched my friends disappear, they just couldn't understand my illness or the stress I was under. Anyway, here is what I learned. You are your own advocate. Your emotional health is primarily up to you. That is not to say that you don't need a counselor, after all, I have 2. Look up the Mental Health Hot Line in your area, they should be able to point you to a therapist to help you. When you are down, I want you to look out the window and find something interesting and beautiful to appreciate. Concentrate on beauty. Look at your children and see the good in them. Look at your husband. The bright, vibrant lady inside you chose him over all others, so I know there are good points about him - find them and concentrate on the good! If you are a spiritual person, read the Bible or the religious works that you find comforting. Whenever your mind gets a negative thought, immediately banish it and concentrat
e on something positive and uplifting. I have a large framed photograph of a hibiscus bloom that I look at if there are no flowers in bloom and coffee table books of fine art to look at. See how many birds you can see from your window or better yet, go outside and look for them. Do not dwell on sorrow! Watch funny TV shows so you can get great big belly laughs, The Big Bang Show, I Love _NAME_ and the _NAME_ Show are my go to shows for laughter. Do what ever it takes to get those laughs. Get some exercise, even if it is only walking for 5 minutes at a time in the house, it will help. If you can get outside, go for a walk, the fresh air and exercise will be wonderful. Laughter and exercise both release those feel good hormones in our brains that will lift our mood and reduce our pain, both mental and physical. So exercise and laugh - a lot! And most of all I want you to remember that you are a valuable person and God Loves You! I'm praying for you! _NAME_-51"

175956009,"I had the cough and weakness for a couple months. I had to crawl at times I was so weak. Went to the ER twice and was sent home They said you've got a virus and rest. That's when the anxiety started followed by the low mood. I had my thyroid checked in the past, but not recently. I was treated for Lyme Disease about 10 years ago. I was tested for that again recently and negative. My vitamin D levels were low before. Maybe I should have that checked again. Someone suggested Prozac if I have depression."

174342729,"You 'sound' good Glad to hear you are doing well and that you are working with a therapist. About nonconformity--that is a good observation and, come to think of it, was there ever a time when nonconformity wasn't pathologized? Don't know much about schizophrenia, but that sounds like a serious diagnosis. Many are, and I don't react well to that kind of person. I don't blame you one bit for isolating yourself. My view of humanity improves greatly the more time I spend alone. But sunshine (vitamin D) provides untold health benefits, so I force myself to go outside at least once a day. Right now, I haven't eaten in 5 hours, so I'm feeling fragile and a tad hostile. However, once I eat (home-cooked chicken, a tiny amount of rice, organic broccoli, and _PERSON_ pre-grated sharp cheddar), I will almost certainly feel solid and at peace. One of the things I've been doing, in order to combat my various pathologies, is trying to observe my mood fluctuations, finding their immediate cause, and instead of st
aying angry at this or that other person, taking responsibility for my bad feeling . When I remember to do this, I feel a lot better. My sleep schedule is all over the map--nothing consistent at all. I wake up and the clock says 6:24 or some such, but I won't know if that's night or day, or what day of the week it is. That's gotta change, since I hear that discipline and a consistent schedule help greatly with mood. Never a short answer here, but I'm glad to hear you are well. Please take excellent care of yourself and remember to eat quality foods"

175956040,"I'm not sure yet what my psychiatrist is doing, she works in the same office as my therapist so I imagine phone would be an option with her too, but I'd still have to go in anyway to pick up my months worth of vraylar samples. That's not till April 16th though"
175956041,"Over the years I have noticed a clear distinct pattern of almost actual behaviour to the nature of hearing voices, as though in real-time conversations with a person or persons. I would love to hear from anyone who has or can relate to these observations as in a relative model. In order to make it more digestible, I will list them as follows. 1) They (voices) use tactics to make you respond to them, as they(voices) are looking for a reaction or some kind of response, in order to form a type of repeatable trigger, the idea is to use anything they (voices) can use to get you to engage within the conversation, it could be flattery, humouring you, or mostly using invasive insults directed at you. What stands out is the need for you to feed them with your acknowledgement or attention. 2)The use of negative psychological tactics like Bait & Switch, procuring a trigger or anchoring you to a word or phrase in order to torture you with said stimulus. This is known as anchoring. 3) They at times when grouped 
together use sort of Phishing tricks in order to extract information, emotionally groom you or try to psychological blackmail you, once successfully phishing you for weakness within your character, also even more noticeable is that combined the 'voices' have the characteristics of a sociopath. They will constantly goad and taunt you 24/7 even when in the bathroom, it's like being tied to a sex offender as they will use you as a common street drug. 4) The rate of volume differentiates between loud group mobbing's, to the single whispering of one voice reminiscent of a game of charades, whereby you have to finish off the last word or guess what they referring to. 5) The use of uncommon language or unknown vocabulary within the context of what's said by the voices, you would have to lock up the intended reference or veiled suggestion. 6)They are more frequent at night time when trying to sleep, also this can be accompanied by a feeling of lightness of your head like if drunk the night before, as well as a moment
ary blue flash of light like a spotlight or street light shone directly at you, are about to nod off. You notice out the corner of your eye. 7)The voices can comment on real-time events and things that you are doing, which makes you think you're being covertly filmed or spied upon. via bugs or hidden camera's. Mimicking abusive trends like Molka. 8) It always responses back to your inner speech or what's termed as sub-vocalisation or silent speech. This offend gets confused with actual thoughts a person is having, as most real cognitive thoughts are non-vocal, like moving your arm or moving your head from side to side. 9) There seems to be an ear or side of your head that is more broadcast-able, with me it's my left Ear. 10) They stop the harassment/broadcast when you take the meds.( Rohypnol) 11) The experience can include momentary Tinnitus which sounds like a very tonal high pitched tone, like what you hear when attending a hearing test at Hospital Audio-gram machine. 12) Some times the voices are 24/7 and 
last for a number of years and at other times it's reduced to none at all. 13) By its nature it mimics trolling culture and Twitter storms, also Snap-chat witch hunts mobbing campaigns. 14) They 'Voices' try to turn you into their plaything or play cat & mouse with you, by use of power and control manipulation mind games. They want you to be a controlled victim or abuse plaything."
175956042,"Ht- Thank you and same to you. _NAME_- I get the same rx each time. I do not like it but it has help so much and I am on day 3 tonight. So I feel better just hard to do a lot especially since it's over 100 degrees this week. I am on the mend, just sucks to be ""sick"" in the heat."

175956046,Oh. Right. Weed always made my anxiety super worser.
175956047,"* I apologize in advance if I come off as too much 'me me me' but I am attempting to share my own observations and experiences in order to possibly let others know how they are not alone * Many of my behavioral traits can be classified under the terms Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression and General Anxiety Disorder. Remember, we are referring to Behavioral actions. How we act/behave. I say this to remind myself as much as anyone else. Let's talk about the lack of self-identity I have. I can honestly say that I don't really know who I am. I'm a name that was assigned to me at birth. I have great struggles when it comes to what am I like?, what do people think of me? how do other people see me? I don't know but I'm thinking about it non-stop. along with the billion other things. I don't really have a strong sense of self. I am not very effective at boosting my own mood. I seek affection, approval and identity externally. That is the only way I can get it. What others think of me; what they sa
y to me; what they show me; and especially my constant repeating evaluation of what I THINK they think about me. It is so exhausting and spins the mind like the flywheel on a dragster going down the track. Relationships are so very challenging. I also will find myself in the sandbox with that awful schoolyard bully Paranoia and his sidekick _PERSON_. These two show up most of the time around my spouse. I know she is not doing anything other than trying to support me, love me and work with me to make the best life for our family. My mind is the worst toxin I could possibly imagine. It is debilitating, confusing, disorienting, makes me blind to reality, turns simple things into something so complex even modern day computers would respond with What?, and even if I am able to go to sleep when I'm having a severe struggle moment, it's right there like the worst hangover you can ever imagine when I wake up as if I never went to sleep. I will question anything and everything with my spouse some times when those two 
P&J show up and sit on my though process like a mac truck, even when I have every reason and all the proof in the world not to second-guess. Paranoia of not being good enough; not meeting expectations; disappointing the other person; disapproval by the other person; I fear disapproval and disappointment worse than death. I expect that I am not living up to their wants/needs/expectations and so I live in a state of constant guilt/shame/worry. I respond horribly to any comment/observation/point that does not shine rainbow and unicorns about my and will most of the time react in an angry, defensive-offensive manner and ride the runaway-train of emotion to ugly places. As my spouse says, I make a mountain out of a mole-hill, and let me tell you, Everest has nothing on my mountains. I have great difficulty appropriately communicating empathy/sympathy and really giving my spouse what she needs to truly feel listened to, heard and understood in the way she was intending. I can't get over that selfish emotion of, ""Y
eah I hear you but I want/need/feel...."" I often feel that my wants/needs/feelings are discounted, even though they may not be, and my reactions/words/actions, result in my spouse feeling discounted, and her feelings completely ignored. It's ugly. That's the ugly Aunt Selfishness. These demons extend beyond my spouse and I'm seeing more and more how several of them have been messing with me almost my whole life. I'm 46 years old and I was 'diagnosed' with BPD Borderline Personality Disorder last year, while at a partial hospitalization (daytime) program which I self-admitted to. I spent a lot of time at self-reflection and introspection. I actually utilized some of the aspects of AA and self discovery. I have my DBT workbook and I was in it about half an hour ago trying to shine up some of my tools. ** on a side note, DBT has some really great ideas and for some people it is their step-by-step instruction manual that they have on their nightstand and read a passage from every night. I'm honestly glad that wo
rks for you. For me, I'm more of a concepts, logic and practicality kind of guy. [ at least I like to think I am :) ] DBT is more of a supplement to my thought processes and logic paths, as well as organizational and decision tree tools. I expounded the jealousy/paranoia lens beyond just my spouse and looked at all of my relationships with family, friends, not-friends, acquaintances, significant others, FPs and where things went right as well as just as importantly where they went bad/wrong. I looked at where I had been stepped on, and painfully where I had stepped on others, directly or indirectly. I looked at trauma and issues that happened. I looked at my life through the lens of abandonment, even down to the smallest possible event. There were a lot of common threads that I could trace directly to one or more of the nine basic behavioral markers classified under Borderline Personality Disorder. I became aware of traits in my daughters as well as my parents and grandparents that were all hanging from the s
ame thread. Be honest with yourself. You are not BPD. BPD is an identifying label wrapped around behaviors that can really screw up our lives/relationships/minds. You may have some or all of those behavioral traits but that is not all you are. Reach out in as many directions as you can. Online Groups Online Chatrooms Online Forums Online MessageBoards Phone Numbers Google Hangout Meets Zoom meetings In-person 1-on-1 In-person small group In-person large group Don't limit yourself to 1 solution. There are many ways to hit a nail on the head and many of them will do just fine. I still struggle every day, sometimes every minute. I'm not done living yet. Even when I may loose hope that I have more to do and more to experience, I reach out in one way or another but I always make sure to be crystal clear on how much I'm hurting/struggling/suffering at that moment. Otherwise, I am just sabotaging myself and creating self-fulfilling prophesies, which I do way too much with BPD. There are not enough active/effective/b
eneficial resources. Not everyone heals the same way, just like not everyone learns or understands the same way. We need more. Keep active in these online resources. We need more 24/7 live resources."

I’m closer to 178 now since I stopped walking though so I’m a little chubby. I guess what I’m saying is you’re fighting your body past a certain point where you can always be hungry or just let go and let your body stabilize where it wants and have normal hunger where you can eat when hungry. The set points are of course much lower without APs but you live the hand you’re dealt. This is just what I do, ymmv."

Mine got really bad, to the point that grocery store shelves and lines of text would kind of blur and then refocus constantly and look like they were moving. Since the worst of it I now have gotten a lot better and mostly only notice it on certain high contrast patterns and pictures. I never got an answer from my medical doctors and have been dealing with this for about 9 months. Computer screens are especially provoking. The good news is, if you stumble on this thread with the same issue like I did, you can probably expect some natural improvement although it may take awhile. Make sure you wear glasses if you need them, do your best to relax as much as you can and rest your eyes as much as possible. Good luck! I will update if the condition resolves on its own."

I also smoke marijuana which I know has negative connotations attached to it, but I don't just smoke for the sake of getting high and giggling for hours on end. The real reason I do it is that it significantly improves my mood/appetite, the intensity of my remaining spasms and because it is a common interest for my brother and I to be able to bond and to vent with one another. At home, I have 5 cats which are ours and one stray who we've been looking after for years. I understand how strange this will seem but I only have a good relationship with two of the 5 cats, the rest I don't really care about. However, a
t my finances place, we have two parakeets who I usually look after while he goes to work. The thing that really bothers me about Covid_PERSON_ the fact that as nice as the ""alone together"" campaigns are, people including the POTUS aren't taking this seriously enough. People are upset about needing to wear masks outside of the home in conjunction with being quarantined inside for months in some cases. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ have butted heads on the prospect of when and how we should open the country/ world/ businesses, _PERSON_ seems way more concerned with the economy than with taking the necessary procedures to keep the American people safe so that we can return to work or school in a systematic way that will cut down on the spread of the disease. I understand that the economy is very important and that we can't afford to stay shut down forever, but what he needs to understand is that if he thinks that things are bad now just wait until the eventual second surge that will be caused by the protesters and pe
ople returning to work soon. I completely agree that people need to be wearing masks and adhering to the CDC guidelines for social distancing, but if the president isn't holding the American people accountable for slowing the spread this gives them the excuse of: ""Well the president doesn't think it's a big enough deal, then why should I?"" It's just incredibly frustrating because _PERSON_ is meant to have American's best interest in the forefront of his mind, not cutting corners to give the economy an admittedly much-needed boost, at the cost of getting people sick and having people day just so that he can pat himself on the back and be able to say ""I got America back up and running even with Covid-19 still being a threat."""

175956113,"I have a 13 year old son who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety. He's unfortunately been dealing with this for many years now and has seen numerous counselors and different psychiatrists who have all tried different methods of treatment (different medications, types of therapy, etc.) but I feel like he's only getting worse as the time goes on. His rages can last hours now and they happen all the time. When he's upset/angry he is very mean and nasty verbally, disrespectful, belittling, threats and/or tries to destroy things in our home, becomes very mean verbally towards the family dog, will kick and punch furniture or walls, throws things, threatens to run away and sometimes he does just walk out the front door and he's threatened suicide. He's been _PERSON_ Acted twice and when he comes home he immediately goes right back to his usual behavior. He is now as tall as I am so now that he's older he has pushed me onto the tile floor and another time he literally pulled my 
cell phone out of my hand and I physically was unable to get it from his hands. Without my phone I'd have no way to call for help if needed. I try to stay calm and patient but this has been going on for so long that I feel like I don't have much left in me. I basically have no family support with this and feel lost and alone regarding the matter. I don't know what else I can do to help my son so that he gets and feels better?"
175956114,"Makes sense. Next time people harp on about a tragedy that kills scores of people I will remind them those people had the good fortune to die in the company of others. The simulation theory also makes little sense to many, may as well be a fairytale. Perhaps the idea of God, religion and the bible is ok for those who cannot grasp a more metaphysical concept. Personally I didn't find simulation theory helpful on a daily, practical level. For sure. Undoing this, or resisting this conditioning from religions, society, teachers, parents is what often causes mental health issues. It's a good question. Do we have a choice over internal suffering? I will have to think about that. I think the answer might be 'yes' we do, but i'm not 'feelin it' ... and wonder if it is another form of conditioning to think we do."

175956139,Thanks for all of your feedback. I didn't experience side effects at 600mg of the Lithium so maybe that is worth a try. Seroquel will remain for my sleep. My insomnia is too severe for Melatonin. I would be awake for 72 hours or longer if I didn't have the Seroquel.

I'm so glad I came back to PsychCentral and found you all. I live in a residential community for people with mental illness and it can feel surprisingly isolating because most of the people here don't want to get better or want to talk about their illnesses so we can support each other.

We have been going through the _PERSON_ movies in their chronological order--The Hobbit movies first, then The Lord of The Rings movies--and finished them last night.

We reach then into reality. Such are the moments of our greatest happiness. Such are the moments of our greatest wisdom.

oncept and Technique of Picture Making, the Study of Art In another thread (which I looked for but couldn't find), you wrote about feeding the pigeons (?) in Washington Square Park early one Sunday morning, and said that your fondest memories of your last relationship were always when you were physically away from your then-partner. I've always wanted to say that I think that that is true for most people. One of my mother's friends, _NAME_, a lady who was kind (without being patronizing) to us when we were poor, enjoyed a very happy marriage and raised kind children ? really good people. _NAME_ mentioned once to my mother that she thought the secret to her happy marriage might have been that she and her husband spent most of each day apart, in their own worlds, working on their own projects. Which leads me to suspect that, for neurotypicals as well as schizoids, the benefits of being 'with' someone are in fact the warmth of one's hours alone . That, in fact, actual time with a partner is best appreciated when 
kept to a minimum. I sent the following to my schizoid friend: '""We should make a minimum of gestures, pronounce a minimum of words, even see each other as seldom as possible, if that would prolong things.We don't know how much of everything we have ahead of us so we have to take the greatest precautions not to destroy the beauty of what we have. Everything exists in limited quantity ? especially happiness. If a love is to come into being, it is all written down somewhere, and also its duration and content. If you could arrive at a complete intensity the first day, it would be ended the first day. And so if it's something you want so much that you'd like to have it prolonged in time, you must be extremely careful not to make the slightest excessive demand that might prevent it from developing to the greatest extent over the longest period."" . . .

Now I knew it could be no other way. He was obviously capable of sidestepping all stereotyped formulas in his human relations just as completely as in his art. One recognizes the stereotypes even if one has not experienced them all. He took command of the situation by stopping the intellectual game, sidestepping the erotic one, and putting our relationship on the only basis possible in order to be significant for him and ? as I even then realized ? for me as well.' ? _PERSON_, Life with Picasso"

This might be the single best way to identify schizoids in the wild. That's not so unusual. We have our ringer and voice volume zeroed-out ALL the time. My cell phone is always off, and I check email once a day if that. Seriously (pitifully?), I find bowling compelling, riveting, and suspenseful And the deal with never actually doing the thing which thrills one the most is not exclusive to schizoids. Whatever deluxe combo platter of undiagnosed mental illnesses I have manifests itself in that way too, among others. This might be common to many mental illnesses. Petty objections aside, you've actually built a strong case. I seem to recall several observations here and there 
that certain characters from popular entertainment (live-action and animated) exhibit schizoid traits. Perhaps catering to a groundswell of demand? Could it be. Could it just be, that there are actually a ton of schizoids about, feigning affection, mimicking normalcy? Such that our collective idea of 'normalcy' is increasingly, if not entirely, artificial? Arguably, the percentage of neglectful, self-absorbed, superficial, materialistic, impatient, and entitled parents has been increasing since the TV age."

It can be debilitating for sure, but I do think there’s hope for some amount of recovery, though it takes hard work and a lot of support. I don’t know the situation as well as you do, so I can’t say whether your fiancé would be willing or able to put that work in right now to find the resources and supports he needs. I think what’s important here is that you are not responsible for his mental health, he is. So you need to do what’s best for you in the long term. That being said, there are some resources available that he may be interested in. The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance has support groups (though they may be meeting online right now because of the virus). If you go to their website, you can put in your zip code and see what they have near you. They also have this thing called the Wellness Wheel that you can fill out periodically to track your mental health progress. I know of someone that this h

I have to say he is helping me immensely. I am on a drug called Donnatal. It has Phenobarbital which relaxes me along with other meds for the abdominal pain and cramping. I also take amitriptyline for these same issues. I believe I am like most of us here with anxiety. Fear of making a mistake. Fear of wasting funds.

But, if you want to live together or have a more serious relationship, then may be, you should confide in the person. I think if you are dating someone who has no clue about mental illness, that person could be in for a shock. But, if the person is also mentally ill, then confiding in that person should not be an issue. Eventually, if you do become serious, then confiding may be important. When should you confide in that person? Well, there is no good time, but. may be, you should wait until that person confides in you about that person's health issues. As a result, it all depends on what you are seeking from that person."

Add to that the fact that you are facing a huge lifestyle change, in living less independently and not having the home that you've known for so long...I would be surprised if you weren't feeling stressed! Take baby steps towards packing and working out the moving details. Give yourself breaks so you don't get overwhelmed. Remind yourself if the positive aspects of relicating...and try to keep your focus there, rather than on what you will miss. Do you have a therapist currently?

The issue was that I couldn't understand not being right, which may sound odd, but I'd never considered the fact that my PoV might be the one that was inaccurate. This may apply to everyone, but for me it was worse, because my behaviour was so damaging to those around me. Bear in mind that I'd been told that I was wrong since I was a kid and that has never really stopped, so my attachment to being right was fundamentally identifying. Now, I tend to do the opposite. I almost crave being wrong because I now know that it's not going to be destroying to me and I find myself becoming addicted to another point of view. I guess it was never really about ""being"" right; it was about not being able to accept the fact that maybe my self-perception was inaccurate. There's a lot of fallout to it. Having to accept, albeit it theoretically, that I'm to blame for much of the stuff I've been accused of doesn't give me much justification space, but it does make me feel better. I prefe
r to think that I'm to blame for others' misery, as it doesn't feel unjust anymore. Nice quote."
175956276,"I like others are sort of left out of the loop ( hung out to dry) when it comes to explaining just what in the world causes our strange synonyms of hearing voices, thought broadcast, having the feeling that we are marked out of the normal run of things as we attract a lot of unwanted attention via public swarming, rude or unhelpful people, staring at us in a vindictive way, this years later after I was repeatedly told I was delusional is actual in reality called _PERSON_, a type of clandestine white-glove treatment aimed at exclusion, gaslighting and stalking a loser nobody like me for the best part of a decade, seems totally unreal, you even realize this as it’s really happening to you, in real-time, you could film the flash mobbing at its height it’s like ( _PERSON_’s goes to Russia, ) very overt and with participants expressing pride and malice clandestinely toward you.

175956280,"Do you genuinely enjoy thinking this way? Thrilled someone besides me appreciates the antifreeze story. Remembering it really makes me smile . The intellectual challenges of every job I've ever had have always paled next to the social bee esse and absurd ""power"" plays. Humanity excels in nothing if not getting in its own way. A mathematically brilliant friend of mine made an observation that might help you decide. He said that the reason managers absolutely need high salaries and ""the corner office"" is that they are denied the legitimate satisfaction of a job well done , of solving a gripping computational problem, for example, or of finding a long-elusive, intermittent bug. For their success, managers largely depend on the creativity and intelligence of others, and on their ability to earn the respect of those who report to them. Would the attention, demands on your time, and endless unproductive meetings eat away at your zest for life? Another wise friend said, "" You know exactly how importa
nt managers are when no one can tell when the manager is on vacation ."". Years ago, I used to go to a weekly nighttime drawing session in which a group of people would draw the figure from a live model. One of the regulars, let's call him H-P, strutted with the unmistakable self-satisfied smugness of a short-guy high-level tech manager. One night, while drawing, I stated both of the underlined observations, above . And watched as H-P literally deflated --from frowning, to grimacing, to hunching-over. He never showed up to another drawing session Trolling that egotistical moe-foe had been surprisingly easy . I suspect that at some not-too-deep level he was painfully aware that he had become an impostor."
175956281,"See if there are state or local chapters of _USER_ID_ or DBSA. If not, your county mental health dept. Why? You need a case manager who is your advocate and who knows the state and local system. These people exist. You need to talk to anyone you can to identify someone... it may require some research and time. But it is vital for you now. Good luck."
175956282,So a few hours ago I played golf with a friend. We only played nine holes. An hour later he texted me and said he had a temp of 101.2. I was coughing a little bit but he didnt think it was anything serious and i didnt either. This has me really worried that I will likely get the flu. I am 28 and my friend is 25 but I still hear stuff about people dying from the flu. I didn't get my flu shot this year. I felt fine before he texted me but now I wonder if my mind is manufacturing symptoms so to speak. Can anybody alleviate my anxieties?
175956283,"That’s a good point, it could become just somewhere to vent. I’ve seen ones you can buy that are like wellness journals which might keep it more positive. I started taking pictures to try and remember the good times but I fell out of habit with it. Oh god yeah, I had a diary as a teenager and my mum found it...that was an absolute nightmare. Don’t think my partner would read it, but there’s always the worry."
175956284,My little brother is playing the drums in the house and preventing me from working. _USER_ID_: I told him to stop.
175956285,"I used to post frequently here back in the day and now post on schizoid reddit where I made the exact same post: I read comments about how it's all about ""if you're fine with yourself, ###$ the world"", and it's all good. In fact with age(I am 34) I have come to not only make peace with my schizoid-ness but even revel in it. I was insecure and even needy all my 20s. I feel in the past few years I have changed. My schizoid does not bother me one bit. However................ the problem is I am not fine with myself. When I compare myself to the 24 year old me- I am deteriorating mentally, physically and psychologically. The negative traits- apathy, anhedonia, laziness, lethargy.. ..it seems its only getting worse with age. I certainly had more energy 10 years ago. I could sit and concentrate on a movie or even two a day. Now I can barely finish a 10 minute web series. I can barely sit through a book. What is worse is I have the desire. I buy books- I like paleontology, astronomy, comics, video games 
but everything is just piling on the side. I can't play video games, rather just fantasize or sit staring.I buy games and just create a collection. This anhedonia is getting worse with each passing day. Why is this happening? Why the avolition? I have dreams, I can even fantasize about ambitious days but when it comes to do anything I just can't. I create lists, I set plans and then never do them or do them half assedly and leave. With food I create a food chart and follow it for 3 days and then back to square one. I go on a walk one day- feel great and promise I shall do it again tomorrow and then kaput! There has to be a physical aspect to this- this absolute desire to not do things, not follow up. Why this zero willpower? Why the lack of motivation to such an extent> This is biology right, guys? Tell me..........How is not enough love in younger years result in this avolition? How is low affection and love in my early life dictating my physical being today on a daily basis? How is neglect and abandonment r
esulting in dire laziness, lethargy and apathy?"
175956286,"Hyper focused still. Trying to figure if I could afford to put $100 a paycheque because then it would be worth $15,000 in five years... that might be too much to swing $100 biweekly right now.

Keep us posted and if it doesn't feel right make sure to let the doctor know. I have found that mindfulness also helps and meditation helps anxiety. Wellbutrin made me very super agitated. I have tried it three different times and always makes me nervous and gives me insomnia. One time it made everything taste strange. I tried it as zyban once to quit smoking, I think that was when it made stuff taste bad. Wishing you the best. Keep us posted. Hugs, _NAME_... Hi _NAME_. Thanks for the your always sage words.

175956289,"I'm not going to beat myself up for procrastinating my routine list with extra Vyvanse (Which is likely to make anxiety worse) and taking rare alprazolam (Which can cause dependence again). I wasn't getting anxiety when withdrawing from it - I just couldn't sleep. But I've been staying awake for a while because I'm so uncertain of everything and need to fix it. This is what the site said about uncertainty and it relates to me; ""Seeking excessive reassurance from others: This might be asking friends or family their opinion on a decision that you have to make List-making: As a way of eliminating uncertainty, some people will make long and detailed “to do” lists, sometimes several lists every day Double checking: For example, calling loved ones repeatedly to “make sure” that they are okay, or re-reading emails several times to check that they are perfect and that there are no spelling mistakes Refusing to delegate tasks to others: Many people who are intolerant of uncertainty will not allow a
nyone either at work or at home to do certain tasks; this is because they cannot be “sure” that it will be done correctly unless they do it Procrastination/avoidance: Because being uncertain can cause anxiety, some people simply procrastinate or avoid people, places or situations. If you do not do something, then you don’t have to feel uncertain about it Distraction: Many people who are intolerant of uncertainty keep themselves “busy” most of the day, that way, they don’t have the time to think about all the uncertainty in life"""

175956322,"Hi. I’m new to this online community and I’m hoping to find some help and support through reading and writing to others. I suffer from addiction, as well as anxiety and depression on and off. I am a very high functioning person, but then I just implode. I feel as though I let myself go and I just go, go, go or end up doing more for others than myself- and I end up miserable. I seem fine right up until I’m not! It’s very confusing for me, because I don’t have direct triggers related to my disorders. At least nothing solid I can identify as a tipping point. I seem to do well under stress and when everything levels out, I self sabotage my life all over again. I just don’t know how to break the cycle! I’ve had spouts of clean time in my life now- but I am on a methadone program because now since I’ve never had any long term success without one. I just had a year almost this time around and I blew it with a few uses and now I’m back on the horse. I’m Ok, back to normal, but I just ca
n’t seem To make it long term. I feel grateful for all I have in my life and constantly wonder why I can’t just be free of the things that effect me so greatly. I’m constantly torn and feel like I’m all over the place. My family is overbearing, but I tend to be a recluse and not have friends outside of the family anymore so I need them to turn to. It’s all complicated lol I just want some simplicity in my life and to find what it means to truly be happy- because I feel like I’ve done a lot of work on myself and I’ve come a long way, but I need to continue to evolve. Does this all make any sense to anyone? Do you ever feel like your addiction and mental health status control your life? Or are identified as the black sheep of the pack? I just feel lost sometimes. I don’t want to be defined by my issues. There has to be a middle ground somewhere! To truly love yourself, embrace your issues and what makes you, you, and march forward in life and always evolve into a better person. If you made it th
rough all that, thanks for listening. Let me know your thoughts!! Xo"

I find that when I want to give hubby a nasty reply, if I deliberately close my mouth, and throw the anger away....it seems to help. Maybe with you it is different, and one thing you could do is talk to your doctor and see if your medication needs to be adjusted."

I have an identical twin who lived through the trauma with me but she turned out to be a lot like them.

175956379,Yes but I need to take my supplements. I didn't take them last night.
175956380,"I’m from _NAME_, I have depression and anxiety which is normally kept maintained by medicine. For some reason when me and my fiancé get into disagreements it triggers my anxiety and depression. We had a really bad night last night and I cut myself from how bad I had messed up. Then today my family is blaming me for the reason why they haven’t had much to do with me. I’m tired of me being the one messing up. I want a break from life"
175956381,Me too......All I do is sit at my desk at work and read. Get home and sit in front of the telly either with my book or without.
175956382,"Possible trigger: part of me wonders if I should have just ended it when I was depressed. Now I’m just having mixed feelings, my meds seemed to be working but I don’t want to deal with this world. I cried yesterday and today due to stress my emotions are just mixed up and I don’t know what to do"
175956383,Saw a bluejay today
175956384,Morning Feel good right now. But got business to take care of. Sucks.
175956385,My plan in the morning is to wake up at 10am. I'll set my alarm for 9am.. Take first Vyvanse.. Second at noon.. I'm extremely miserable ^-;
175956386,I just want to watch movies and chill but i cant. I cant play video games because I dont have patience because I'm thinking about improving myself and needing to exercise I dont want to gain weight I want to be healthy so I want to read a book about keto but cant do that because I have so many things to do but so many things make me paralyzed and being on disability idk how long I'll be on if and working will drain me I cant wake up in the morning too tired have to wake up at noon my doctor isnt a psychiatrist and doesnt know he is my moms bipolar friends doctor and she is unstable as hell and drinks a lot and does coke and makes me lie for her then I stand up for myself and she says I'm having an episode to my mom shes a hypocrite and went to a party with all the other coke heads that she says she hates and says psychedelics are drugs because shes brainwashed by the government and the drug war like almost everyone And the illuminati better not be killing people because of high population then I'll 
go nuts but it's stupid to think that the crypto and stock market investors said so I want to invest but idk if the economy will get better or if I'll miss the opportunity and the crypto investor said I need to live and die for something but I hate soldiers and the lil wars I'm compassionate - invest in oil and Tesla **** I canf stand it all and my past and my ex step dad telling me what to do theres always things to do I never looked after myself or mental health and attempted suicide prescribed 120 klonopin for agitation and SSRI's give me psychedelic dlflashback so does alcohol Maybe this is because I drank alcohol yesterday on st _NAME_ day I had a good day skiing yesterday but alcohol doesnt do anything to me not sedated everyone can drink and feel good.

174343255,"I'm doing well. I am just focusing on working and am doing well. I exercise most days too and will walk tomorrow again to the store to buy food. I am feeling fine. I have new students and did not receive any complaints again. I really like my job. However, I'm thinking of going into real estate here by becoming a real estate agent. I have to pass the test here in the country's language which could be very difficult. I used to be a salesperson before a long time ago and liked it. I am thinking about doing this because teaching here is a dead-end job. I passed the highest level in the country's language proficiency test already. So, I just need to brush up and focus on this exam. I thought about being a real estate agent in the usa too but the requirements are much more than here. Here, I can take the test without any experience in real estate. This does not mean it is easy. It is a very hard test and not many people pass it. I will buy the books for it later this month when I get money. I am looking 
forward to doing this. I like my job a lot but realize I can't do it for thirty more years. So, I need to change jobs soon. The company I'm working for is ok but there are no benefits. So, I have to be realistic about my future. I am happy for now. I have much to do although I teach less than 20 hours a week. I have to prepare for my lessons and this takes a lot of time. It is ok because I like this job. I am doing well because I take my medication each morning, exercise, and eat somewhat healthy. I also sleep a lot. I am really grateful for what I have. I can't believe I am supporting myself on my meager income. Hopefully, I will be able to earn more as a real estate agent. I will try my best!"
175956388,I do all of this! I dance while I cook. Have you heard of the comedian _NAME_? He's hilarious.
175956389,"Do you guys think I'm on too many meds? Like I'm on quite a few, is that weird? Wellbutrin Zoloft Trileptal Trilafon Thorazine Topamax and Klonopin PRN I've been on this combo for quite some time now, just doses have been adjusted"
175956390,I learned the intro to one of sufjan _NAME_ songs on uke. It was so awesome. I brought it with me too to the new place.
175956391,"Yes, I did."
175956392,That’s what I need! Coffee with that French vanilla creamer in the kitchen. But watch me fall asleep afterwards.
175956393,I am alone and disconnected all the time. I've been mentally sick all my life with ocd and depression. Me and my husband are room-mates only and he's my only support. My siblings have shunned me for years. They drown their feelings with alcohol. I go to Church but no one will befriend me. Reading to get my mind on something else really helps me. But so alone. _NAME_.
175956394,You know benzos work as sleep aids....I believe you had something along those lines. Sometimes one good night of sleep is all you need to reset. I know you don’t want to become dependent but limit yourself to a night or two max and you won’t.
175956395,I feel atrocious. My psychiatrist abandoned me and the new one also won't respond. At least I am in an IOP but I need the meds figured out.
175956396,My stomach feels sick. I'm hoping I don't start throwing up. That's the last thing I need.
175956397,I'm having one of those days where I'm ravenously hungry
175956398,So sorry Day Tripper
175956399,Did not last night. But did this morning..............

175956401,"I think I didn't report here yesterday, & I took everything. But today I only took my Rx."
175956402,"I've been taking them everyday, started the increased dose of trilafon yesterday. Today is a little better than yesterday in terms of paranoia so that's a good thing, hopefully as time goes on things keep getting better"
175956403,"asiangal555: You said that you took Mirtazapine anti-depressant for anxiety. I didn’t fully realize that most medicines prescribed for anxiety are anti-depressants. about the anti-depressant you’re taking, Mirtazapine, net says it does help with anxiety also. I as a bipolar also take Mirtazapine, for the depressed side of my bipolar, while I take Lithium stabilizer to keep the anti-depressant from getting my mania going, or from causing panic attacks. From reading the net, it seems there is one (main) long term medicine (not short term like Zanax) used to treat anxiety. It's called Burspar, now also called Buspirone. The website californiahighlandvistas.com says: “GoodRx writes that health care providers can prescribe buspirone in addition to an antidepressant to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). That antidepressant can be either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). It has been found that buspirone can help enhance th
e effects of an antidepressant drug.” Again, it says, “It has been found that Buspirone (Buspar) can help enhance the effects of an antidepressant drug.” So, if you’re still anxious from taking just the Mirtazapine, maybe you can ask your doctor about what he or she thinks about your taking Buspar along with the Mirtazapine “to enhance the effects of the antidepressant drug.” It also says above, ""That antidepressant can be either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). It has been found that buspirone can help enhance the effects of an antidepressant drug.” The net also says Mirtazapine antidepressant is not in those classes (SNRI or SSRI), so you will probably need to ask your doctor if you'll need to change your antidepressant. I find this data by typing into the search engine: ""Mirtazapine for anxiety"" and ""anti-anxiety medicine"" and ""Buspar for anxiety."" You might want to look at some of those topics, also."
175956404,Tuxedo cats are often said to be more intelligent. This is certainly true with mine.
175956405,"No, it jut happens after I take it so it's not a big problem, I don't feel like I'm going to pass out or anything, just racing heart if I stand up fast. If I'm careful about that I'm all right"
175956406,"Welcome to pc, _PERSON_ I hope things are better for you than when this thread was started"
175956407,Just lost my long response to this Lucky you
175956408,might ask my doc to either up the lexapro to 20 or add an anti anxiety med
175956409,Did you go for th salmon.?
175956410,"Oh, I don't think you'd get locked up. Going off meds is so common they can't lock everyone up. You were doing really well before you went off them, you got the job you wanted and I think you're going to school (?). I hate to see you suffer like this."
175956411,"I feel like I need to take a break from any social media, facebook, discord, etc so that I can learn to find my values without the noises of the crowd. I’m feeling depressed and burned out from this."
175956412,I’m sorry bluebird....nothing will ever replace them.
175956413,I love you but these numbers aren’t good. Maybe try limiting your caffeine a bit - but don’t stop completely that’s how you get bad withdrawal. I think you should think about maybe even leaving a message for your doctor especially if reducing caffeine doesn’t work. I hate to say it but this much lack of sleep could be sign of hypomania and I don’t want you to slip into mania. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
175956414,"Maybe because Physical needs were met ( food, shelter, water) , so existential matters came to the fore. Advancements in Science and the Big Bang theory? Opium became scarcer Yes. I guess the feeling of loneliness means one is reverting back to making it all about 'them'. I find that when I truly grasp the concept that 'nothing really matters', stress levels dissipate and I become more lighthearted. I think people might be too busy with their pilates, zumba classes and botox appointments. Last time I mentioned him in a sentence, the other person thought I was talking about the Dalai Lama. whats on my mind today There is so much on my mind today I must take a nap and dream it all away."
175956415,Less than ten minutes until my exam! See you guys on the other side.
175956416,"I'm a weedhead, so yeah, I have issues. I don't smoke nearly as much as I used to, but so what. Technically I'm a drug addict. Marijuana can make me paranoid in high doses, but I don't smoke up like that anymore. It definitely makes me more insular and withdrawn, but I was introverted long before I started smoking. A simple trip to the grocery store can be thwarted by getting even a little bit high, but if I have some social obligation I can't get out of, smoking will make it more bearable. If I'm already out, it can increase my sociability, but that's not necessarily a good thing because it can also make me stupid and abstract to the point where nobody knows what the hell I'm talking about. For me, it crushes anxiety better than alcohol or benzos. So there's that."
175956417,"Thanks folks. I was given Wellbutrin and lithium carbonate by my doc. He also gave me a referral to physical therapy because I included that I formerly could improve symptoms with running, but not since a running injury. It took em a few weeks but I got in to see a psychiatry office. I saw a nurse but she was smart. She gave me lamictal instead of lithium to control my irritability and anger feelings. The physical therapy is covered except for co pay which is cool. They happen to include massage and “dry needling” which is acupuncture but on the muscles rather than meridians. I’m so glad I got this looked into before coronavirus, and we are all home. Currently the kids are watching tv after a while melt down over practicing piano. My kids are adverse to even slightest discomfort (like playing legos alone or playing a piano song one more time). At least I am able to weather this with a calmer attitude. There is 100% a hormonal cycle where I get worse in the 2 weeks before my period, so we shal
l see if the medicine keeps me afloat during that time. Thanks for the help to get another opinion. I fell into the trap that no one would help me and no one would believe me because I can manage my symptoms (through extreeeeme effort). They believed me! They helped!"
175956418,"Yeah, it is where the psych unit was in those days, or one of them, anyway. So, yeah. They actually kicked me out of the program. Ha!!!!!! I was a very baaaaaad patient, or something. Sent me to this place in Santa Fe that was way, way better. Awesome place. Love Santa Fe. Could totally live there again, if my kids and dad weren't out here."
175956419,Thankyou so much gizmofab! We got this

175956422,"I believe that more patients have seen the light that shines through the wooded forest of how our minds work and behave in response to unwanted or even unconsented stimulus to things like 'voices' & group gaslighting. By way of definition, modern Psychiatry is clearly a failing quasi-judicial medical cult. There is no messianic wonder drug, or chemical imbalance this is evidence of brainwashing within the profession, I think we as sufferers could and maybe should form our own treatment network."
175956423,"Wow, I guess sister's would be the first to tell you something like that. But I doubt you get on other people's nerves. I am glad you are hungry to learn and don't let anyone stop you from doing that. So you have a high pitched voice. Nothing wrong with that. I have a couple of friends who are small and have high pitched voices. Doesn't bother me at all unless they talk baby talk to my dog. It gets her excited. Try not to worry. I think it will blow over. Focus on classes and learning. Keep asking questions, that is how you learn. I wish you the best. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175956424,"In atomic habits they have you start a new habit by setting the scene a bit, like if I’m going to go out for a walk I have a routine, sweatpants on, running shoes on etc....if I’m remembering right just putting onthe shoes is enough for most people to want to start walking so the goal is the shoes not the walk...."
